According to NME , Gaga's freedom of self anthem album is getting the lockdown -- thousands of copies of the album were impounded by Lebanese authorities due to Gaga's lyrics which they believe are \"offensive to Christianity.\"But the space age artist shouldn't be too surprised by the country's reception of the full album. The singer's recent single, 'Judas,' was also banned from Lebanon's radio stations. Malaysia has also displayed similar responses to the album, banning the title track from their radio stations because they believed it was \"promoting homosexuality.\" \n \n There were even rumblings from the US Catholic League in anticipation of Gaga's 'Judas' video and it's religious affiliations. But after the video was released, it's convoluted message and imagery laid to rest any criticism from the League.Do you think Gaga is pushing the envelope too far? ||||| Lady Gaga's religious firestorm may have blown over in the United States, but the government of Lebanon found it so enflaming that they've banned the popstar's new album from the country's stores. \n \n Multiple reports say that the Lebanese government impounded shipments of \"Born This Way,\" the already-platinum album due to its alleged insults to Christianity and its all around \"bad taste.\" \n \n The Lebanese government has made clear their distaste in Gaga, having already banned her single \"Judas\" from the airwaves. That song caused a brief ruckus in the United States, too, as conservative religious leaders, including those from the Catholic League, initially protested the song's lyrics and pending video. \n \n \"This is a stunt... Lady Gaga tries to continue to shock Catholics and Christians in general: she dresses as a nun... she swallows the rosary. She has now morphed into a caricature of herself,\" Catholic League President Bill Donohue said in a statement before the video came out. \n \n He then sang a somewhat different tune, waving off the video as a mess and incoherent. \n \n According to Metro UK, the song \"Born This Way\" was banned from radio play by the government of Malaysia, too. In response to that banning, Gaga, responded, \"What I would say is for all the young people in Malaysia that want those words to be played on the radio, it is your job and it is your duty as young people to have your voices heard.\" \n \n \"Born This Way\" went platinum in its first week out, selling 1.1 million copies in the United States alone. \n \n According to one Lebanese blogger, he had already downloaded the album via Amazon, with the songs existing safely in the cloud; so, many Lebanese still have the ability to listen to Gaga's latest opus. \n \n In a prescient comment, in a recent feature in the British newspaper The Guardian, Gaga decried religion's impact on government. \n \n \"The influence of institutionalised religion on government is vast. So religion then begins to affect social values and that in turn affects self-esteem, bullying in school, teen suicides, all those things,\" she told the paper. \n \n Lebanon has a history of banning entertainment they find religiously offensive; in 2004, they banned the Tom Hanks-starring big screen adaptation of \"The Da Vinci Code.\"",

    "document": "Editor's Note: The News & Record will provide updates of the trial on its Twitter (@newsandrecord) and Facebook (facebook.com/newsandreco\u00adrd) feeds. \n \n \u2014 Andrew Young answered his cellphone. \n \n It was Rielle Hunter. She was distraught and said she needed to get in touch with John Edwards, who was then in the thick of running for president. \n \n Young, a longtime aide to Edwards, was with his family and didn\u2019t feel like dealing with her. \n \n \u201cSomebody better be pregnant or dying,\u201d he said to Hunter half-jokingly. \n \n Hunter told him nobody was dying. \n \n On Tuesday, Young testified about how in 2007 he found out Edwards\u2019 lover was pregnant. He also revealed details about living with Hunter, the money that was used to cover up her relationship with the former U.S. senator from North Carolina and a special \u201cbat phone\u201d that Edwards used for talking to her. \n \n Edwards, 58, is on trial for violating campaign finance laws. At issue is nearly $1 million in contributions from heiress Rachel \u201cBunny\u201d Mellon and Texas trial lawyer Fred Baron that went to conceal his affair with Hunter, a campaign videographer. \n \n Edwards initially brushed off allegations he was the father of Hunter\u2019s baby. \n \n \u201cHe said she was a crazy slut, and there was a 1-in-3 chance it was his child,\u201d Young said. \n \n Wearing a dark suit, light blue shirt and green tie, he avoided looking at Edwards as he took the stand for his second day of testimony. \n \n Edwards sat with an occasional smile, calmly looking at Young. \n \n He told prosecutors that in 2006, after Edwards had come home from a long trip, Hunter had called Edwards\u2019 cellphone, only to get his wife, Elizabeth. \n \n Hunter, thinking it was Edwards, began making suggestive comments. \n \n Elizabeth, furious, forced her husband to call Hunter back and break off the affair. \n \n From that point on, Edwards used another phone to contact Hunter. Young would hang onto it when Edwards was at home. \n \n \u201cDid you give it a special name?\u201d prosecutor David Harbach asked, referring to the phone. \n \n Young provoked snickers in the courtroom when he answered, \u201cthe bat phone.\u201d \n \n Prosecutors entered into evidence a handwritten letter from Mellon. The letter, which she wrote after news broke of Edwards\u2019 $400 haircuts, mentioned that the campaign should send her the bills for any future haircuts. \n \n Young said he and Edwards thought she also might be amenable to covering other expenses they wanted to keep secret. \n \n After Elizabeth Edwards found out about the affair, Hunter was let go from the campaign. Needing to support Hunter (and fend off threats to expose the affair), they decided to ask Mellon for money, after rejecting the option of seeking money from other sources. \n \n Though they did not tell her why they needed the money, Young said, Mellon wrote about $750,000 worth of checks. They were made out to interior decorator Bryan Huffman. Young\u2019s wife, Cheri, would deposit them in a personal account. \n \n Edwards has denied knowing about the checks from Mellon. \n \n For about three weeks beginning in September 2007, Hunter stayed with the Youngs in Chapel Hill. \n \n In his testimony, Young described Hunter as a difficult houseguest who refused to buy her own groceries, saying that she might be recognized, but who had no problem shopping at places like Neiman Marcus. \n \n One night in December, Young discovered reporters outside his house who were trying to dig up information on Hunter\u2019s pregnancy. \n \n The next day, Edwards called him and launched into what Young described as a \u201ccampaign stump speech.\u201d \n \n \u201cHe talked about how this was bigger than all of us, how the election started in a couple of weeks,\u201d Young said. \u201cHe talked about poverty, about ending the war in Iraq. ... And he said, 'They don\u2019t give a s--- about you. They want me.\u2019\u201d \n \n He wanted Young to claim paternity of Hunter\u2019s baby. \n \n A few days later, Young, his family and Hunter went into hiding. They stayed at luxury hotels in Hollywood, Fla.; San Diego and Santa Barbara, Calif.; and Baron\u2019s mansion in Aspen, Colo. \n \n Harbach asked Young why he went along with the scheme. \n \n He and his family were in \u201creally deep,\u201d he said, having already taken in Hunter. \n \n But he also had loftier reasons. \n \n \u201cWe believed in the causes. ... I wanted to help my friend be president,\u201d Young said. \n \n \u201cAnd being friends with the most powerful person on Earth, there\u2019s a lot of benefits that go along with that, for you and your family.\u201d \n \n Young\u2019s testimony will continue today. \n \n Contact Robert C.

Edwards, 58, is accused of secretly soliciting more than $900,000 in illegal campaign funds from two wealthy donors to hide his pregnant mistress during his failed bid for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. (CHRIS KEANE/REUTERS) \n \n As star witnesses go, Young was none too shiny; he repeatedly got flustered, annoyed the judge by mumbling, and raced through those answers that were at variance with his tell-all book. He so often made the prosecutor repeat his question that I lost track of how many times the government lawyer had to admonish his own witness: \u201cSir, that\u2019s not what I asked you.\u2019\u2019 \n \n Still, two crucial things Young said under oath Tuesday did ring true: \n \n His detailed description of how Edwards persuaded him to claim paternity for the child the candidate himself had fathered with Rielle Hunter was credible. \n \n And when Young said his motivation for agreeing to do such a thing was completely opportunistic \u2013 \u201cI wanted my friend to become president because a lot of benefits go along with that\u2019\u2019 \u2014 he was at his most convincing. \n \n Prosecutors say Edwards knowingly broke the law by using illegal campaign donations to keep his mistress quiet and his \u201808 presidential chances alive. \n \n But the defense maintains that it was Young\u2019s idea to claim paternity, and that Young was freelancing when he solicited money from Edwards supporter Bunny Mellon. Edwards says Young bilked her -- not on his behalf, and not even for Hunter\u2019s benefit, but to pay for the $1.5 million home Young was building. Young did not, however, come off as a likely mastermind. \n \n There he was, he said, buying a turtle aquarium for his kids, when Edwards called on his cell and went right into stump speech mode, telling him that he needed him to claim paternity not for his own sake, but for the sake of something that was bigger than all of them, because it would allow Edwards to become president, vice president, or attorney general. \n \n Edwards also told him that his wife Elizabeth was dying, Young said, and that he didn\u2019t want headlines about a messy, career-ending affair to dominate the final months of her life. \n \n But by his own account, Young did not agree out of either loyalty or sympathy for Mrs. Edwards, but because he was still hoping to cash in \u2013 though he no longer thought it likely that his one-time dream of working in embassies around the world under President Edwards was going to come true. \n \n There were a slew of internal inconsistencies in Young\u2019s testimony; at one point, for instance, he said Edwards didn\u2019t want to know any of the details about the various schemes for paying off Hunter, so that if he became attorney general later, he wouldn\u2019t have to lie. \n \n At a number of other points, Young said Edwards had detailed knowledge of what was happening, and indeed was directing him. Of course, life is full of inconsistencies, especially amid a drama this over-the-top. \n \n The defendant showed emotion only twice on Tuesday; when Young said Edwards wanted to keep his hands clean so he could become AG, the former senator raised his eyebrows in either astonishment or mock astonishment, and shook his head. \n \n And when Young made a mistake in his timeline and said Hunter was pregnant before that was the case, Edwards looked triumphant, shared looks with his defense team and whispered to them. \n \n Though Edwards made his fortune as a trial attorney juries just loved, he wisely made no attempt to charm them from the defense table, and took notes instead of angling for eye contact. \n \n Again today, the former candidate\u2019s parents and grown daughter Cate were seated behind him in the courtroom, and to those who\u2019ve asked me if Cate looks like she\u2019s there under duress: absolutely not. A lawyer herself, she\u2019s in constant, animated conversation with her father during breaks, and with worry written all over her face, twists and tugs on her hair during testimony. Though she bears a physical resemblance to both of her parents, she\u2019s like Elizabeth in being so obviously all in on behalf of John Edwards. \n \n Some of Young\u2019s stumbling statements were inadvertently helpful to his old boss: He testified that Edwards told him the money being funneled from Mellon to her decorator, to Young\u2019s wife and then to Hunter was perfectly legal because it was a private gift, not campaign cash. \n \n One of the most horrifying stories Young told on the stand, in terms of the risks Edwards took while running for president, concerned the very night he announced his \u201908 run. After Young picked him and Hunter up for the kick-off event, the former aide said, they passed a bottle of wine back and forth between them en route. \n \n The candidate was feeling so fearless, in fact, Young said, that he dared to bring Hunter right into the rally, where his wife and the mistress all but literally collided while one was going into the ladies\u2019 room and the other coming out. \n \n Years ago, Edwards told me the secret to convincing a jury. The trick, he said, is to tell them all the weaknesses in your case right up front, so that they\u2019ll think gosh, you\u2019re honest, and will then believe the rest of what you\u2019re selling. \n \n You mean, I asked, that it\u2019s sort of like the saleswoman who tells you that Dress A does not really maximize your charms, so that when she later tells you Dress B is stunning, you believe her? Ex-actly, he said. \n \n If that\u2019s true, the prosecution must have scored big points with the jury on Tuesday, because they certainly led off with the weakness in their case, Andrew Young. But judging by how flummoxed he was by the lawyer for his own side, he stands a very good chance of being ripped apart by the defense. \n \n Melinda Henneberger is Post political writer and anchors \u2018She the People.\u2019 Follow her on Twitter at @MelindaDC. ||||| Andrew Young, former aide to former U.S. Sen. and presidential candidate John Edwards, leaves federal court with attorney David Geneson, right, in Greensboro, N.C., Monday, April 23, 2012. Prosecutors... (Associated Press) \n \n John Edwards' first reaction when he learned his mistress may be pregnant was to downplay the chances he was the father, calling the woman a \"crazy slut,\" his former close campaign aide testified Tuesday. \n \n It was the summer of 2007 and Edwards was in the midst of a presidential campaign. Andrew Young testified the former North Carolina senator hatched a plan to funnel money from rich friends to provide the woman a monthly allowance, even though Young said he doubted it was legal. \n \n Months later, as word of the candidate's affair began to leak in the run-up to the crucial Iowa caucuses, Young said Edwards asked the aide to falsely claim paternity of the baby. \n \n Young has been the lone witness during the first two days of Edwards' criminal trial. The 58-year-old Edwards has pleaded not guilty to six counts related to campaign finance violations involving nearly $1 million in secret payments provided by two wealthy donors as he sought the White House in 2008. \n \n Young said Rielle Hunter told Edwards she was pregnant in June 2007, weeks later than the aide originally claimed in a tell-all book published in 2010. Young said Edwards, told him to \"take care of it,\" meaning the pregnancy. \n \n \"He said she was a crazy slut and there was a 1-in-3 chance that it (the child) was his,\" Young testified. \n \n Edwards directed Young to start giving money to Hunter in May 2007, after she threatened to go to the media and expose the affair, the aide said. Edwards suggested asking elderly heiress Rachel \"Bunny\" Mellon, who had already given generously to the campaign. \n \n Prosecutors showed the jury cancelled checks from Mellon written to her interior designer, who would then endorse them and send them to Andrew and his wife, Cheri. Starting in June 2007, Mellon would eventually provide checks totaling $750,000. \n \n Without telling Mellon what the money would be used for beyond that it was a \"non-campaign\" expense, Young said she offered to provide $1.2 million over time to help pay for the candidate's personal needs. Under federal law, donors are limited to giving a maximum of $2,300 per election cycle. \n \n \"We were scared,\" Young said. \"It was a truckload of money, more money than had ever flowed through our accounts. ... It was crazy.\" \n \n Young said he expressed concern to Edwards, a former trial lawyer, that they might be violating federal campaign finance laws. \n \n \"He told me he had talked to several campaign finance experts and that it was legal,\" Young testified. \"It felt and smelled wrong. But he knew more about the law than we did. We believed him.\" \n \n Young said Edwards also directed him to use the money from Mellon to provide a monthly allowance to Hunter of between $5,000 and $12,000. The money would allow her to travel and continue to meet up with the married candidate while he was away from his home and now deceased wife, Elizabeth, who had grown suspicious of the affair. \n \n Young will retake the witness stand Wednesday, when the defense is expected to have their first opportunity to cross-examine him. \n \n The baby Edwards fathered, Frances Quinn Hunter, was born in February 2008, right after he suspended his campaign after a series of primary losses. After years of adamant public denials, Edwards eventually acknowledged paternity in 2010. The girl, now 4, lives with her mother in Charlotte. \n \n Prosecutors had phone records showing dozens of calls between Young and Edwards. The candidate often used the phones of campaign staffers to call his trusted aide and mistress to avoid his wife seeing the other woman's number on his bill. Edwards also obtained an extra cellphone his wife didn't know about that they and Hunter called the \"Bat Phone,\" Young said. \n \n In later testimony, Young said in December 2007, Edwards had the idea of Young claiming paternity. It came after reporters from a tabloid tracked Hunter down in the parking lot of a North Carolina grocery store. By that time, non-tabloid media had also started to pick up the trail as the campaign was preparing for the early 2008 primaries. \n \n Edwards said they needed to \"give the press something they would understand, an affair between two staffers,\" Young testified. Hunter had produced several videos documenting life on the campaign trail for Edwards. \n \n Young said Edwards \"talked about how this was bigger than all of us,\" and reaffirmed to the aide he wanted to help the country by getting troops out of Iraq and remaking health care. He also said he didn't want his cancer-stricken wife to have to deal with a scandal before she died. \n \n The Youngs agreed to get the mistress, who was then living in a $2,700-a-month rental home near Chapel Hill, out of North Carolina. They began a cross-country odyssey of travel on private jets and stays in luxury hotels. While they were on the run, the federal indictment alleges that more than $183,000 in bills related to Hunter's care was paid by Fred Baron, a wealthy Texas lawyer who served as Edwards' campaign finance director. Baron has since died. \n \n Young testified that Edwards put him in touch with Baron's people to arrange the details, which included stays at Baron's palatial vacation home in Aspen. As prosecutors highlighted the group's movements, photos of the blue-water resorts and mountain mansion were shown on video monitors around the courtroom. \n \n Baron also sent Young overnight packages stuffed with cash. On included a handwritten note from the wealthy lawyer: \"A- Old Chinese saying, use cash, not credit cards!\" \n \n When asked why he agreed to claim paternity and care for Hunter, Young said power was the lure. \n \n \"I wanted my friend to be president,\" Young said. \"Being friends with the most powerful person on earth, there are benefits to that.\" \n \n Edwards has denied knowing about the money provided by Mellon. In opening statements on Monday, his defense lawyer Alison Van Laningham said the Youngs siphoned off the bulk of the money to pay for the construction of their $1.5 million house near Chapel Hill. \n \n The indictment filed by the U.S. Justice Department last year recounts more than $933,000 in unreported payments from the two campaign donors who had already given the maximum contributions allowed by law. \n \n Defense attorneys say even if Edwards knew about the secret payments from Mellon and Baron, they don't fit the legal definition of political contributions because they were not meant to influence the election. Instead, they say, the payments were gifts meant to hide Edwards' affair from his wife, not voters. \n \n If convicted on all six counts, Edwards faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and as much as $1.5 million in fines. \n \n Edwards sat silently in the courtroom Tuesday as prosecutors played several voicemails he and Baron had left on Young's cellphone in December 2007 and January 2008. At that time, Edwards was in the heat of the presidential primaries and was constantly in the public eye. \n \n Though none of the voicemails played for the jury contained evidence that was in itself damning, it illustrated that Edwards was in frequent contact with Young and Hunter while they were on the run. Young said Edwards expressly told him not to inform him of their exact location, because the candidate \"didn't want to have to lie if he was asked about it.\" \n \n Asked by a prosecutor why he began keeping the voicemail and notes now being used as evidence against his former boss, Young replied: \"If I didn't have these, nobody would have believed me.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow AP writer Michael Biesecker at twitter.com/mbieseck",

    "document": "SOCHI, Russia \u2014 When speedskating competition resumes Saturday, the U.S. team will be on the ice with a familiar but new look. \n \n They're hoping their results are the same: familiar, but new for these Games. \n \n \u201cFor the remainder of the Winter Olympic Games, Team USA speedskaters will be wearing the previously-approved Under Armour skin suits used during recent World Cup competition,\u201d Mike Plant, president of US Speedskating, announced in a news release just before dawn Saturday in Sochi. \n \n US Speedskating earlier sought approval from the International Skating Union and the International Olympic Committee to revert to the World Cup suits. By ISU rules, uniforms must be consistent throughout a team, so the new Mach 39 suits are out and the old suits are in for the remainder of the Games. \n \n Pressure for the change built this week in the wake of a disastrous performance through six events by a team with high expectations. No U.S. speedskater has medaled, including the world's top-ranked skaters, Shani Davis and Heather Richardson. \n \n The suit became the leading suspect for the poor showing. The suit is unproven apart from these Games and was introduced only last month. Richardson attempted to modify her suit this week. The results matched her teammates results: out of the metal. \n \n US Speedskating chief executive Ted Morris earlier confirmed an application with the ISU was \u201cin the process,\u201d and its approval would make swapping the suits \u201can option.\u201d But he said USS is evaluating everything \u2014 from athletes' training to their diets \u2014 in addition to Under Armour's suits. \n \n \u201cWe don't think (the suits) are having any impact. But at the same time we want to make sure when our athletes get on that start line they have confidence and are ready to go,\u201d Morris said late Friday after meeting with staff and 17 skaters. \u201cThat's priority number one.\u201d \n \n The Tribune reported Friday that federation officials were working to get clearance to race in suits that were worn during 28 World Cup medal victories. They also are from Under Armour, but the World Cup attire does not have the supposed benefits of the Mach 39's features. Many skaters brought their old suits with them to Sochi. \n \n \u201cWe've performed well in the World Cup suits. I won a World Cup in that suit,\u201d skater Joey Mantia said after practice Friday when asked if he preferred the older suits. \u201cAt least there's some kind of confidence there with that.\u201d \n \n The glaring lack of any Olympic medals from a program that has won 67 Winter Olympics medals \u2014 the most of any winter sport for the country \u2014 has thrown coaches into a frenzy searching for a way to salvage their Games. \n \n The last time the U.S. failed to medal in speedskating? Sarajevo, 1984. \n \n \u201cWe're scratching our heads to try to figure out a way to switch it up here with half the Games left,\u201d Morris said. \n \n Davis said Friday the hoopla over the suit would not distract him. After a tuneup in the 500 meters on Monday and disappointing eighth-place finish in the 1,000 on Wednesday, the South Side native is optimistic about his chances in the 1,500, likely his final individual Olympic race. \n \n \u201cGot to rebound from that 1,000. We still have it here,\u201d Davis said Friday, smiling and smacking his chest. \u201cSo let's get it on!\u201d \n \n The Mach 39 suit \u2014 developed with defense contractor Lockheed Martin \u2014 was marketed as the fastest ever in the sport. But its design and materials remained tightly guarded, revealed only after the U.S. Olympic team was set in January. \n \n Glenview's Brian Hansen, who finished 33rd in the 500 and ninth in the 1,000, said he was frustrated by not being able to try the suit beforehand. \n \n \u201cIf the entire U.S. team is underperforming compared to our potential \u2014 literally everyone \u2014 you can only look at so many factors,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cIs it the suit? Is it our preparation? The suit's the easiest thing to fix.\u201d \n \n Patrick Meek, who finished 20th in the 5,000, said he still believes the Mach 39 is the fastest. \n \n \u201cThese guys make F-16 fighter jets,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they can invade Afghanistan and Iraq, they can build a speedskating suit.\u201d ||||| U.S. speedskater Shani Davis during the Olympic 1,000-meter race.

The team said it had brought the older uniforms with them to Sochi. \n \n After a tense two-hour meeting of team members and staff on Friday afternoon, U.S. Speedskating submitted simultaneous appeals to the IOC and the International Skating Union to be granted the option of changing back to their old suits as early as Saturday. \n \n The main criticism from the skaters was that vents on the back of the suit, intended to let heat escape, were letting in air and making it harder for athletes to skate with proper form. Concerns over these design flaws were first reported by The Wall Street Journal on Thursday. \n \n The team has had the suits since Jan. 1 and tested them in simulated race conditions during their pre-Olympics camp. But the skaters had never worn them in competition before the Games. \n \n An spokeswoman for the ISU said Friday that if the team wanted to switch to a suit that is identical to ones approved at the start of the skating season\u2014and if every team member has access to one\u2014the switch would be legal. Olympic protocol requires all members of a national speedskating team to compete in the same kind of suit. \n \n U.S. Speedskating executive director Ted Morris said Friday that the team members were locked in a debate over which suit to wear going forward. He said the team's members were split evenly and no final decision had been reached. \"The general feeling from the athletes, it's pretty darn close to 50-50,\" Morris said at the time. \n \n Haley said the team ultimately decided to change the suits largely at the insistence of a minority of skaters on the team who are considered medal contenders. \n \n The uniform swap puts Under Armour in a tough spot. If the U.S. team wins medals in the old suits, \"it will be embarrassing for Under Armour,\" said Matt Powell, an industry analyst for SportsOneSource. Baltimore-based Under Armour Inc. is primarily known for its performance apparel. Shares of the company closed at $106 late Friday, down 2.38%. \n \n Haley, the Under Armour executive, contested the notion that changing to the previous suits would harm the company's reputation. \"They're all Under Armour suits,\" he said. \"We just want the skaters to win.\" \n \n In his statement, Plant said U.S. Speedskating was \"proud of its long-term, successful partnership with Under Armour.\" \n \n After six long-track events in Sochi, no U.S. skater has finished better than seventh. That includes gold-medal favorites Shani Davis and Heather Richardson, who dominated the World Cup circuit this season. \n \n \"Coming off one of the stronger fall seasons, of course we were expecting to take home a bunch of medals, lots of hardware,\" Kip Carpenter, a coach with the U.S. team, said. \n \n Questions around the suit began to surface on Wednesday after Davis finished eighth in the 1,000 meters, an event he won at the 2006 and 2010 Olympics. This season, wearing the previous suit, Davis claimed the top spot in three of four World Cup events over that distance. \n \n Some skaters requested fixes to the Mach 39 suit from Under Armour's seamstress in Sochi. By the time Richardson competed in the women's 1,000, the controversial vent on her suit had been covered up with a rubber patch. Even with the change, she finished seventh. \n \n During Friday's meeting, members of the squad were focused on identifying solutions for turning around their Games. Morris said it was one part of a continuing discussion, which has also highlighted potential issues with race tactics, skate blades and a decision to train at altitude before traveling to Sochi, which sits at sea level. \n \n On Friday morning, several skaters refused to place the blame on the suits. Patrick Meek, who worked closely with Under Armour and Lockheed Martin throughout the development process, stood by the two companies' design. \"These guys make F-16 fighter jets,\" Meek said. \"If they can invade Afghanistan, they can build a speedskating suit.\" \n \n Carpenter, meanwhile, said he didn't believe changing the suits would solve everything. \"It's ridiculous to think we're slowing down a second and a half because of a skinsuit.\" \n \n At a morning practice session Friday, Davis said he would feel confident going into Saturday's 1,500 no matter what he was wearing. \"Suit or no suit, I'm going to try to go out there and try to win.\" \n \n Write to Joshua Robinson at joshua.robinson@wsj.com and Sara Germano at sara.germano@wsj.com",

    "document": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 When the news broke that Reality Winner, a 25-year-old NSA contractor with an apparently heavy social media presence, had been charged with leaking a classified document to reporters, many people wondered: How does someone so young have a such a top-level security clearance? \n \n It\u2019s actually very common. \n \n \"The vast majority of people who do the National Security Agency\u2019s intercept work, who translate and analyze \u2014 most of them are fresh out of high school,\" said Matthew Aid, an intelligence historian who has written about the NSA. \"There are thousands and thousands of 18 to 21-year-olds doing critically important and secret work around the world.\" \n \n Related: Feds Arrest NSA Contractor in Leak of Top Secret Russia Document \n \n The NSA is a military intelligence agency, and many of the people who work on the front lines of intelligence gathering in the military are young enlisted personnel. If they are eavesdropping on anyone from a terrorist in Afghanistan to a Russian colonel, they need a very high security clearance. The equipment, the methods, the words they hear \u2014 are all highly classified. \n \n So it was that Winner, who served in the Air Force from 2010 until December 2016, found her way to a job as a contractor at an NSA facility in Georgia. A Cryptologic Language Analyst for the Air Force, she was fluent in the languages of Afghanistan. She was arrested at her home Saturday for allegedly leaking a document about Russian hacking of U.S. electoral systems that was published in a story by The Intercept on Monday afternoon. \n \n The issue that Winner\u2019s arrest highlights is not her age, current and former intelligence officials say \u2014 it is what they perceive as a cultural shift that has led a small but growing subset of spy agency employees to break the ultimate organizational taboo, and share secrets with the public and the news media. \n \n There have always been American spies who have betrayed their country for money. Now, from Chelsea Manning to Edward Snowden to Reality Winner, a new class of rogue employee has emerged: People who decide there are secrets the public needs to know, and take it upon themselves to share them with reporters. \n \n Reality Leigh Winner, 25, a federal contractor charged by the U.S. Department of Justice for sending classified material to a news organization, poses in a picture posted to her Instagram account. Reality Winner / Instagram via Reuters \n \n \"It\u2019s a new kind of insider threat that the agency can\u2019t defend against,\" Aid said. \n \n And it\u2019s getting worse, he added, in part because \"Donald Trump and the change in the political scene in America has created an environment for a lot of people who feel that they have to DO something. You become an instant activist.\" \n \n Winner was vocal in her opposition to Trump on social media, but her motives are unclear. According to federal charging documents, she admitted to mailing a Top Secret document detailing Russian hacking intelligence to the news media. She faces one count of \"gathering, transmitting or losing defense information.\" \n \n The lines are blurry, but Winner and those like her seem in a different class than the Washington insiders who have always leaked to settle internal scores or to make policy points. They are small fries, far from the nation\u2019s power centers, inside a vast intelligence apparatus who decide the public needs to know what they do. Manning leaked from Baghdad; Snowden was based in Hawaii; Winner was in Georgia. \n \n \"These are people who have a greater sense of loyalty to some outside cause than to the organization they are working in, and that\u2019s a new thing for the intelligence community,\" said a former senior NSA official, who asked not to be named so he could speak more candidly about sensitive topics. \n \n There is another dimension, another former NSA official said: Too much information is classified, and everyone working in intelligence knows it. \n \n Related: NSA Leak Mystery Not Solved With Arrest of Hal Martin \n \n Indeed, the document Winner allegedly leaked did not seem, on its face, to be terribly sensitive. The U.S. government, after all, was perfectly willing to acknowledge its authenticity by charging Winner barely an hour after the story broke on The Intercept, as if to send a message. The charging documents don\u2019t link the case to The Intercept, but officials quickly did so in background comments to reporters. \n \n Her attorney, Titus Thomas Nichols, said Winner has yet to enter a plea, although a detention hearing is scheduled for Thursday. She remains jailed in Lincoln County. \n \n \"A week ago today she was living her life,\" he said. \"Now she\u2019s in the middle of a political whirlwind.\" ||||| (CNN) The federal contractor accused of leaking classified information to an online news outlet regarding a 2016 Russian military intelligence cyberattack complained about the Trump administration and posted about leaks on what appears to be her public Twitter account. \n \n Reality Leigh Winner, 25, was employed as a contractor with Pluribus International Corp., a government facility in Georgia from around February 13, according to an affidavit supporting her arrest. Her Twitter activity dropped significantly after that date. \n \n The Justice Department announced charges Monday against Winner. She is accused of leaking classified information, used as the basis for an article The Intercept published Monday, detailing a classified National Security Agency memo. \n \n Twitter account under Sara Winners \n \n Winner posted on Twitter as Sara Winners but didn't seem too concerned with concealing her identity. Her profile picture is a photo of herself, and she posted a selfie in February. \n \n She also uses her Twitter username @Reezlie on Instagram; however, her activity on the two platforms differed dramatically. On Instagram, she primarily posted selfies from the gym and pictures of food, while on Twitter she rarely posted about herself, focusing more on politics -- behavior not uncommon for people who use both social networks. \n \n Accounts she follows \n \n Winner follows 50 Twitter accounts, among them Edward Snowden, WikiLeaks, several with links to the group Anonymous and \"alt\" government agency accounts that became popular after President Donald Trump's inauguration, including AltFDA. None of the accounts appear to be personal connections. \n \n Anti-Trump \n \n Winner didn't hide her disdain for Trump. On Election Night, when it became apparent that Trump would win, she tweeted, \"Well. People suck. #ElectionNight\" \n \n On February 11, she was particularly active on the social network, tweeting directly at the President, describing him as an \"orange fascist.\" \n \n Melania and I are hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Mrs. Abe at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla.

Nichols said he hasn't seen anything that would lead him to believe Winner is guilty of these charges. \n \n CNN has reached out to Pluribus International to ask if it was aware of Winner's Twitter account. ||||| Reality Leigh Winner, a federal contractor from Augusta, Georgia, has been charged by the Department of Justice for leaking classified information on a 2016 Russian military intelligence cyberattack to The Intercept, an online news outlet. \n \n Winner, who is 25 years old, was not a public figure prior to the news of her arrest. Here's what we know about her so far. \n \n A federal contractor who allegedly took a risk \n \n Winner served as a contractor with Pluribus International Corporation, according to officials, and had been working at an unidentified government facility in Georgia \"since on or about Feb. 13,\" according to an affidavit in support of application for her arrest warrant, written by Justin C. Garrick, a special agent with the FBI. \n \n Pluribus International Corporation lists one employee location in Georgia on its website -- Fort Gordon, a United States Army installation -- but it's unclear if that is indeed where Winner was based. \n \n ABC News reached out to Pluribus International Corporation for a comment about Winner's arrest but did not immediately receive a response. \n \n She had top secret security clearance at her job, Garrick wrote in the affidavit. \n \n On or about May 9, 2017, Winner allegedly printed and improperly removed the classified intelligence report, according to Garrick's affidavit, which noted that the material had been dated on May 5. \n \n The Intercept reached out to the government on May 30 for comment on the story it was planning to run, and on June 1, the FBI was notified about that interaction. \n \n According to the affidavit, Winner confessed to Agent Garrick on June 3. \n \n Winner was formally charged by the Justice Department with removing and mailing classified material to a news outlet on Monday. She has not yet entered a plea. \n \n Her attorney told ABC News that Winner remains in federal custody, and will have a detention hearing on Thursday to determine if she will be released before her trial. \n \n \"A good person ... caught in a political whirlwind\" \n \n Winner is a former Air Force linguist who speaks Pashto, Farsi and Dari, according to her attorney, and had recently worked as a yoga instructor at a studio called Oh Yeah Yoga in Augusta. \n \n Oh Yeah Yoga owner Annalisa Adams described Winner to ABC News as a \"reliable\" employee. \n \n \"She taught first class at my studio in January,\" Adams said. \"She started doing sub stuff but eventually - she was so reliable - I gave her two classes.\" \n \n She added, \"[Winner] was never anything but completely professional and we're honestly all in complete shock that she took this step.\" \n \n \"She\u2019s a good person with no criminal history who is caught in a political whirlwind,\" her attorney, Titus Thomas Nichols, told ABC News in a statement Monday night. \n \n Winner\u2019s mother, Billie Winner-Davis, called her a \"very passionate\" person who was outspoken about her beliefs. \n \n \"Very passionate about her views and things like that, but she\u2019s never to my knowledge been active in politics or any of that,\u201d Winner-Davis told The Daily Beast on Monday. \n \n Gary Davis, Winner\u2019s stepfather, described Winner to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Tuesday as a veteran and a patriot. \n \n \u201cShe\u2019s a veteran, six years\u2019 service of the Air Force,\u201d he said. \u201cShe received commendations during that time. She\u2019s just a passionate young woman who probably made some mistakes.\u201d \n \n \u201cYou may not agree with her politics but she is a patriot,\u201d Davis told the paper. \n \n Winner's social media presence shows her to be frequently critical of President Trump, and concerned about environmental issues. \n \n Roughly four months ago, she wrote a Facebook post that was critical of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. \n \n \"Repeat after me: In the United States of America, in the year 2017, access to clean, fresh, water is not a right, but a privilege based off one's socio-economic status,\" Winner wrote. \"If that didn't feel good to say aloud, contact your senators today and tell them those exact words as to why the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines cannot be built on American soil. Let's fix the pipes meant to bring water, sans lead or pollutants, to our citizens before we build pipes meant to benefit big oil and poison the land. #NoDAPL\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Reality Winner was charged Monday with leaking a document about the Russian hacking of US electoral systems. One of the most surprising things, according to NBC News, was that a 25-year-old had top-level security clearance. But apparently it's not that unusual. Most people who do NSA work involving intercepting communications and translation are just out of high school. \"There are thousands and thousands of 18- to 21-year-olds doing critically important and secret work around the world,\" an expert on the NSA says. Many of them, like Winner, are young members of the military. She served six years in the Air Force. A high security clearance is needed to listen in on terrorists or members of foreign governments. Intelligence officials are concerned that Winner is part of a growing number of American intelligence employees leaking state secrets not for money but because they feel the public has a right to know the information. The election of President Trump is making people feel like they need to take action. CNN details Winner's anti-Trump comments on social media. And ABC News has more information on the 25-year-old, including that she speaks Pashto, Farsi, and Dari and had recently worked as a yoga instructor, where she was known as a \"reliable\" employee.

    "document": "Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh declared fervently at his Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday the court \"must never, never be viewed as a partisan institution.\" But that was at the end of a marathon day marked by rancorous exchanges between Democrats and Republicans, including dire Democratic fears that he would be President Donald Trump's advocate on the high court. \n \n The week of hearings on Kavanaugh's nomination began with a sense of inevitability that the 53-year-old appellate judge eventually will be confirmed, perhaps in time for the first day of the new term, Oct. 1, and little more than a month before congressional elections. \n \n However, the first of at least four days of hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee began with partisan quarreling over the nomination and persistent protests from members of the audience, followed by their arrests. \n \n Strong Democratic opposition to Trump's nominee reflects the political stakes for both parties in advance of the November elections, Robert Mueller's investigation of Trump's 2016 campaign and the potentially pivotal role Kavanaugh could play in moving the court to the right. \n \n Democrats, including several senators poised for 2020 presidential bids, tried to block the proceedings in a dispute over Kavanaugh records withheld by the White House. Republicans in turn accused the Democrats of turning the hearing into a circus. \n \n Trump jumped into the fray late in the day, saying on Twitter that Democrats were \"looking to inflict pain and embarrassment\" on Kavanaugh. \n \n The president's comment followed the statements of Democratic senators who warned that Trump was, in the words of Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, \"selecting a justice on the Supreme Court who potentially will cast a decisive vote in his own case.\" \n \n In Kavanaugh's own statement at the end of more than seven hours of arguing, the federal appeals judge spoke repeatedly about the importance of an independent judiciary and the need to keep the court above partisan politics, common refrains among Supreme Court nominees that had added salience in the fraught political atmosphere of the moment. \n \n With his wife, two children and parents sitting behind him, Kavanaugh called himself a judge with a straightforward judicial philosophy. \n \n \"A judge must be independent and must interpret the law, not make the law. A judge must interpret statutes as written. A judge must interpret the Constitution as written, informed by history and tradition and precedent,\" he said. \n \n Kavanaugh also promised to be \"a team player on the Team of Nine.\" \n \n The Supreme Court is often thought of as nine separate judges, rather than a team. And on the most contentious cases, the court tends to split into conservative and liberal sides. But justices often do say they seek consensus, and they like to focus on how frequently they reach unanimous decisions. \n \n Barring a major surprise over the next two days of questioning, the committee is expected to vote along party lines to send Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate. \n \n Majority Republicans can confirm Kavanaugh without any Democratic votes, though they'll have little margin for error. \n \n \"There are battles worth fighting, regardless of the outcome,\" Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, said in an unsparing opening statement that criticized Kavanaugh's judicial opinions and the Senate process that Democrats said had deprived them of access to records of important chunks of Kavanaugh's time as an aide to President George W. Bush. \n \n Democrats raised objections from the moment Chairman Chuck Grassley gaveled the committee to order. One by one, Democrats, including Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, all potential presidential contenders, demanded that Republicans delay the hearing. They railed against the unusual vetting process by Republicans that failed to include documents from three years Kavanaugh worked in the Bush administration, and 100,000 more pages withheld by the Trump White House. Some 42,000 pages were released on the evening before of the hearing. \n \n \"We cannot possibly move forward, Mr. Chairman, with this hearing,\" said Harris at the top of proceedings. Grassley disagreed. \n \n As protesters repeatedly interrupted the session, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, who is fighting for his own re-election in Texas, apologized to Kavanaugh for the spectacle he said had less to do about the judge's legal record than Trump in the White House. \n \n \"It is about politics,\" said Cruz. \"It is about Democratic senators re-litigating the 2016 election.\" \n \n The Republicans' slim majority in the Senate was bolstered during the hearing by the announcement from Arizona that Gov. Doug Ducey was appointing Jon Kyl, the former senator, to fill the seat held by the late Sen. John McCain. When Kyl is sworn in, Republicans will hold 51 of the 100 seats. \n \n Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska are the only two Republicans even remotely open to voting against Kavanaugh, though neither has said she would do so. Abortion rights supporters are trying to appeal to those senators, who both favor abortion access. \n \n Kavanaugh sat silently and impassively for most of the day, occasionally sipping water and taking notes on senators' points. Besides his family, he was accompanied by outgoing White House Counsel Don McGahn and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. \n \n Several dozen protesters, shouting one by one, disrupted the hearing at several points and were removed by police. \"This is a mockery and a travesty of justice,\" shouted one woman. \"Cancel Brett Kavanaugh!\" Others shouted against the president or to protect abortion access. \"Senators, we need to stop this,\" called out one. \n \n As patience thinned and tempers flared, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, denounced what he called the \"mob rule.\" Struggling to speak over protesters, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said: \"These people are so out of line they shouldn't be in the doggone room.\" \n \n But Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told Kavanaugh the opposition being shown at the hearing reflected the concern many Americans have over Trump's \"contempt of the rule of law\" and the judge's own expansive views on executive power. \n \n \"It's that president who's decided you are his man,\" Durbin said. \"Are people nervous about this concerned about this? Of course they are.\" \n \n The panel's top Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, described the hearing's \"very unique circumstances.\" \n \n \"Not only is the country deeply divided politically, we also find ourselves with a president who faces his own serious problems,\" she said referring to investigations surrounding Trump. \"So it's this backdrop that this nominee comes into.\" ||||| CSPAN Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh \n \n Here are excerpts of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s prepared opening remarks for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, as released by the White House. \n \n Also see: Day 1 of Kavanaugh nomination hearing \u2014 live video and updates. \n \n Over the past eight weeks, I have witnessed first-hand the Senate\u2019s deep appreciation for the vital role of the American Judiciary. \n \n At the White House on the night of the announcement, the President and Mrs. Trump were very gracious to my daughters, my wife, and my parents. My family will always cherish that night. \n \n To me, Justice Kennedy is a mentor, a friend, and a hero. As a Member of the Court, he was a model of civility and collegiality. He fiercely defended the independence of the Judiciary. And he was a champion of liberty. \n \n A good judge must be an umpire\u2014a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy. \u2026 I don\u2019t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge. \n \n I have served with 17 other judges, each of them a colleague and a friend, on a court now led by our superb chief judge, Merrick Garland. \n \n If confirmed to the Court, I would be part of a Team of Nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States. I would always strive to be a team player on the Team of Nine. ||||| Follow Day 2 of the Kavanaugh hearing here: Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee faces Senate grilling \n \n The confirmation hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh launched Tuesday as a bitter political brawl, with loud objections from Democratic senators, the arrests of dozens of protesters and questions even from some Republicans about how Kavanaugh would separate himself from President Trump, the man who chose him. \n \n But GOP senators mostly calmly defended Kavanaugh from what Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) called the Shakespearean nature of the hearing \u2014 \u201csound and fury, signifying nothing\u201d \u2014 confident that there were no defections from the solid Republican support Kavanaugh needs to be confirmed as the Supreme Court\u2019s 114th justice. \n \n The 53-year-old judge, who serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, sat impassively for nearly seven hours of senators\u2019 statements before speaking for less than 20 minutes. Senators plan to begin questioning him Wednesday morning. \n \n \u201cThe Supreme Court must never, never be viewed as a partisan institution,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cThe justices on the Supreme Court do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle. They do not caucus in separate rooms. If confirmed to the court, I would be part of a team of nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States. I would always strive to be a team player on the team of nine.\u201d \n \n No such conciliation was apparent on the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2014 or from the White House. \n \n [The story behind the withheld documents of the Kavanaugh hearing] \n \n \u201cThe Brett Kavanaugh hearings for the future Justice of the Supreme Court are truly a display of how mean, angry, and despicable the other side is,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cThey will say anything, and are only looking to inflict pain and embarrassment to one of the most highly renowned jurists to ever appear before Congress. So sad to see!\u201d \n \n The chairman\u2019s opening remarks were delayed for nearly an hour and a half as Democratic senators sought to cut off the hearings, raising an uproar over a last-minute document dump sent to the Judiciary Committee late Monday encompassing more than 42,000 pages from the nominee\u2019s tenure in the George W. Bush White House. \n \n Democrats questioned Kavanaugh\u2019s judicial philosophy and even his honesty. Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who has said he feels he was misled by the judge at his previous confirmation hearing for the lower court, pointedly told Kavanaugh he would question him about that \u201cwhen you are under oath.\u201d \n \n Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) referred to the Republican-appointed conservatives on the court headed by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. as the \u201cRoberts Five\u201d and said the justices were always looking for ways to benefit the \u201cbig fundraisers and influencers of the Republican Party.\u201d \n \n Cruz said his Democratic colleagues were trying to re-litigate the results of the 2016 election. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who noted that he had voted for President Barack Obama\u2019s nominees Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan, was equally blunt. \n \n \u201cYou had a chance and you lost,\u201d Graham told Democrats. \u201cYou can\u2019t lose the election and want to pick judges.\u201d \n \n [Hours before Kavanaugh hearings, Bush lawyer releases 42,000 pages of documents] \n \n Barring any major last-minute surprises, Kavanaugh appears to be on track to be confirmed by the end of the month. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) said a committee vote is likely to occur Sept. 20. \n \n That would allow Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to tee up votes on the floor confirming Kavanaugh during the last week of September. The Supreme Court\u2019s new term begins Oct. 1. \n \n But Tuesday\u2019s opening session indicated that the public fight over his nomination will be intense. \n \n It was, Grassley said later, \u201ca bad start.\u201d Democratic senators repeatedly interrupted Grassley over the document issue, and by the end of the day more than 70 protesters had been arrested. Their theme: The Republicans are hiding something by withholding information. \n \n \u201cThis is the most incomplete, most partisan, least transparent vetting for any Supreme Court nominee I have ever seen,\u201d said Leahy. \u201cAnd I have seen more of those than any person serving in the Senate today.\u201d \n \n Another focus was Trump himself, who has frequently leveled attacks against the judiciary and law enforcement. \n \n Two Republican senators \u2014 Ben Sasse (Neb.) and Jeff Flake (Ariz.) \u2014 praised Kavanaugh personally and professionally, but raised questions about Trump\u2019s attacks on the Justice Department and how Kavanaugh would handle cases involving presidential power. \n \n In a tweet Monday, Trump criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions for the recent indictments of two Republican members of Congress on corruption charges and for the timing, so close to the House midterm elections. \n \n \u201cThat is why a lot of people are concerned about this administration and why they want to ensure that our institutions hold,\u201d Flake said. He added that \u201cmany of the questions you will get on the other side of the aisle and from me\u201d will center on separation of powers. \n \n The protesters, who were predominantly women, repeatedly heckled the senators and Kavanaugh, arguing that installing Trump\u2019s second pick to the Supreme Court would irreparably end access to abortion and dismantle the Affordable Care Act. \n \n Democrats have charged that documents on Kavanaugh\u2019s career have been withheld without justification, particularly those from his tenure as a Bush staffer. Senators have reviewed nearly 200,000 pages that cannot be disclosed to the public, and the Trump administration is withholding an additional 100,000 pages from Congress, claiming that those documents are covered by presidential privilege. \n \n Kavanaugh, appointed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by Bush, served the president in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office from 2001 to 2003 and as staff secretary from 2003 to 2006. \n \n Tuesday\u2019s proceedings brought to the surface years of anger over judicial nominees. Democrats invoked the name of Merrick Garland, who was nominated by Obama in 2016 to fill the Supreme Court seat formerly held by the late justice Antonin Scalia and who was denied a hearing by Senate Republicans. \n \n In his remarks, Kavanaugh praised Garland, the chief judge on the appeals court on which they both serve, as \u201csuperb\u201d \u2014 a line likely to further rile Democrats. \n \n Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) said the Democrats\u2019 behavior would lead them to be \u201cheld in contempt of court,\u201d prompting a chorus of quiet boos and \u201cOh come on\u201d that echoed throughout the hearing room. He later said the hearing had turned into \u201cmob rule.\u201d \n \n When it was his turn, Kavanaugh told senators that he would be \u201ca neutral and impartial arbiter\u201d if confirmed. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences,\u201d Kavanaugh said. \u201cI am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge.\u201d \n \n Throughout his remarks, Kavanaugh noted his appreciation for the strides that women and girls have made professionally and in sports. Kavanaugh\u2019s critics have said his elevation to the Supreme Court would be detrimental to women\u2019s reproductive rights and health-care options, and his emphasis on the strong women in his life seemed designed to counter those concerns. \n \n He talked about his record as a judge of hiring female law clerks and at length about coaching his daughters\u2019 basketball teams, listing by name each player and noting the real-world impact of Title IX. \n \n \u201cI see that law\u2019s legacy every night when I walk into my house as my daughters are getting back from lacrosse, or basketball, or hockey practice,\u201d he said. \n \n In a preview of the tough questions Kavanaugh will face Wednesday, Democratic senators said they would press the judge on his views about abortion, gun control and executive power. \n \n Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) addressed Kavanaugh about abortion. The question, she said, is not whether he believes that the landmark Roe v. Wade decision is \u201csettled law,\u201d as he has told other senators, but \u201cwhether you believe it is the correct law.\u201d \n \n Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said he would resurrect a controversy from Kavanaugh\u2019s 2006 confirmation battle over whether he was involved in developing Bush-era policy on the treatment of terrorism suspects. Kavanaugh worked as a White House associate counsel at the time that Bush developed his policy, laid out in what became known as the \u201ctorture memo.\u201d \n \n As a nominee for the D.C. Circuit, Kavanaugh testified that he was \u201cnot involved.\u201d \n \n Later, Kavanaugh\u2019s denial came into question when The Washington Post revealed that he had participated in a White House Counsel\u2019s Office meeting in which he was asked his opinion about how Kennedy \u2014 for whom he had clerked \u2014 was likely to view the matter. \n \n In response, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) defended Kavanaugh and said the suggestion that the judge had \u201cmisled this committee in any way is absurd.\u201d ||||| Things were charged enough that at one point Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) accused his Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee of degrading the hearing to \u201cmob rule.\u201d Cornyn was rebuffed shortly after by Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who disagreed with the assessment and noted that if mob rule had indeed prevailed, ultimate blame would lie with the chairman. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) helped coordinate that strategy despite not serving on the Judiciary panel, convening a call with the committee's minority members over the weekend, according to a source familiar with the planning. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Grassley, attempting to speak over Democrats as they sought a vote on a motion to adjourn the hearing, acknowledged that \"maybe it\u2019s not going exactly the way that the minority would like to have it go.\" One after another, Democrats repeatedly interrupted Grassley in the opening minutes, breaking into their protests to allow Kavanaugh to speak before resuming their push to stop the process until they can examine more records. \n \n But the display of disruption, galvanizing as it was to Kavanaugh\u2019s liberal critics, ultimately did little but delay a day of partisan jockeying that closed, more than seven hours later, with the nominee telling senators that \u201cI do not decide cases based on personal or policy preferences.\u201d \n \n Grassley said at the end of the hearing that he\u2019s preparing to schedule a committee vote on Kavanaugh for Sept. 13, paving the way for a final floor vote on confirmation before the new Supreme Court term opens next month. Democrats are expected to exercise their procedural right to delay that by a week, at a minimum. \n \n Senators got more than 42,000 pages of documents late Monday night on a \"committee confidential\" basis, a designation that prevents their public release and likely stops Democrats from citing them during the hearing. Even before that latest release, however, Democrats already had begun discussing the protest they would mount Tuesday. \n \n The move appeared to get under the skin of some in the GOP. After repeated interruptions from anti-Kavanaugh demonstrators who were escorted from the hearing room by police, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) suggested that Democrats would be held in \"contempt of court\" \u2014 drawing quick pushback from Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) \u2014 and likened the moment to \u201cmob rule.\u201d \n \n Grassley flatly ruled out Democrats\u2019 repeated calls for an adjournment vote, but the fireworks at the start of the hearing already had set the tone for a raucous week to come. The White House sent a tally of the number of times each Democrat had interrupted Grassley during the first hour of the hearing, for a total of 44 interjections. \n \n Kavanaugh is expected to ultimately be confirmed, with the Senate headed toward a return to 51-49 GOP control following the selection Tuesday of former Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) \u2014 who guided Trump\u2019s nominee through the confirmation gantlet \u2014 to replace the late Sen. John McCain. But Democratic senators are still readying an intense volley of questions for the 53-year-old appeals court judge, focusing on his stance toward an ongoing challenge to Obamacare, the future of Roe v. Wade and his already-expressed skepticism about criminal investigations of sitting presidents. \n \n Democrats have offered few indications that they're prepared to attempt a formal boycott of the Judiciary hearing to channel their ire over the withholding of hundreds of thousands of pages of Kavanaugh-related documents from public release. \n \n \"We will attend the meetings. We will question assiduously. But we want to express our concerns,\u201d the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein of California, told reporters alongside her fellow minority-party members at a gathering on the Supreme Court steps early Tuesday. \n \n Republicans have touted the release of more than 290,000 pages of records from Kavanaugh's time in George W. Bush's White House counsel's office, noting that the volume of public disclosure has dwarfed that for previous Supreme Court picks. But Democrats have been infuriated by the GOP\u2019s omission of any document requests governing Kavanaugh\u2019s time as staff secretary to then-President Bush, tension that was stoked last week when the Trump administration cited executive privilege to shield more than 100,000 pages of records, angering the minority. \n \n After Democrats\u2019 interruptions cooled, Kavanaugh focused his opening statement on his family and friends as well as the support he\u2019s provided to others as a constitutional law professor and volunteer. The judge, who also played a prominent role in drafting the Starr Report on former President Bill Clinton, described himself as \u201cespecially grateful to the dean who first hired me\u201d at Harvard Law School \u2014 Democratic-tapped Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan. \n \n Trump\u2019s nominee described himself as a player on the high court's \u201cTeam of Nine\u201d and a \u201cneutral and impartial arbiter,\u201d if he wins confirmation in the coming weeks. \n \n Liberal activists mounted their own show of force against Kavanaugh throughout Tuesday, the first of four days that are expected to stretch to marathon length. Women dressed in the red-and-white garb made famous by the dystopian novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\" gathered outside the hearing room, demonstrating against Kavanaugh's potential to rule against abortion rights. \n \n Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) was among several committee members in both parties acknowledging the difficulty of speaking over the demonstrators, saying that \u201cwe ought to have this loudmouth removed\u201d after a woman cried out about protecting pre-existing conditions. \n \n Capitol Police charged 61 protesters with disorderly conduct, a spokeswoman said. An additional nine were charged with obstruction or \"crowding.\" \n \n Kavanaugh notably name-checked Merrick Garland, former President Barack Obama's pick for the Supreme Court who was stonewalled by Republican senators ahead of the 2016 election.

That gesture was bound to fall on deaf ears with Democrats who view the entire confirmation process as unnecessarily hurried to get Trump a second seat on the high court in two years. \n \n \u201cWhen Justice [Antonin] Scalia died, Republicans refused to even meet \u2014 even a meeting in their office \u2014 with President Obama\u2019s nominee and held the seat open for one year,\u201d Feinstein said in her opening statement. \u201cNow, with a Republican in the White House, they\u2019ve changed their position.\u201d \n \n While Democrats recognize their limited power to stop Kavanaugh's nomination, they're still using the confirmation process to score political points, especially given the stakes. Kavanaugh would likely bend the court significantly to the right, given that he's replacing retired justice Anthony Kennedy, who long served as a swing vote. \n \n ||||| The start of Tuesday\u2019s Senate confirmation hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh erupted in chaos as Democrats demanded an adjournment and protesters interrupted with repeated shouts and were dragged out by police. \n \n As Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) began his opening statements, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) interrupted to ask that the hearing be postponed so senators could review 42,000 pages of documents about Kavanaugh\u2019s time in the George W. Bush White House that were dumped late Monday. \n \n \u201cWe cannot possibly move forward, Mr. Chairman,\u201d Harris insisted. \n \n \u201cYou are out of order,\u201d Grassley responded. \n \n The Democrats\u2019 objections were greeted by applause from activists in the audience, while some rose to scream objections to Kavanaugh. \n \n They were removed by police, one at a time. \n \n \u201cThis is the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice I\u2019ve seen [subject] to mob rule,\u201d fumed Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). \n \n According to Capitol Police, 61 individuals were arrested inside the hearing and nine outside. \n \n Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) criticized Democrats who have 2020 presidential aspirations for grandstanding for the cameras. \n \n \u201cThey want that coveted TV clip. Frankly, I wish we could drop all that nonsense,\u201d he said. \n \n In the morning, Kavanaugh introduces wife Ashley and daughters Liza and Margaret. \n \n But later, as the protests heated up, Kavanaugh\u2019s daughters were escorted out, according to Fox News. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry your daughters had to endure the political circus of this morning,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas). \n \n The kids returned later to hear former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Lisa Blatt, a liberal Democrat and appellate lawyer, argue for Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation. \n \n Kavanaugh finally got a chance to address the committee seven hours after the hearing began. \n \n \u201cA good judge must be an umpire, a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cIn our independent Judiciary, the Supreme Court is the last line of defense for the separation of powers, and the rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution. \n \n \u201cThe Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution \u2026 If confirmed to the court, I would be part of a Team of Nine, committed to deciding cases according to the Constitution and laws of the United States. I would always strive to be a team player on the Team of Nine.\u201d \n \n Democrats delivered long monologues complaining about a lack of transparency and raising concerns that Kavanaugh would roll back abortion rights, gun control and shield President Trump from criminal prosecution. \n \n As Kavanaugh spoke, Trump took to Twitter to denounce the Democrats trying to block his nominee. \n \n \u201cThe Brett Kavanaugh hearings for the future Justice of the Supreme Court are truly a display of how mean, angry, and despicable the other side is.

Cory Booker, D-N.J., left, pause as protesters disrupt the confirmation hearing of President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, on Capitol Hill... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Spoiling for a fight, some Democratic senators weighing 2020 presidential campaigns seized upon the opening moments of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation hearings on Tuesday in a show of force aimed at countering President Donald Trump. \n \n One by one, Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, including Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Cory Booker of New Jersey, demanded that Republicans delay Kavanaugh's hearing after a last-minute release of more than 40,000 pages of documents and the withholding of more than 100,000 more. \n \n The Democrats' coordinated showdown with the committee's chairman, Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, served as a theatrical preview of what is expected to be a wild, unpredictable 2020 campaign against Trump, who has stoked outrage among Democratic activists and is expected to fuel an unusually large field of challengers. \n \n The hearing showed the degree to which the Senate could be the testing ground of resistance among Democrats who are prepared to fight the Republican president's agenda in a field without an obvious front-runner. And it harkened back to how Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and other Democratic senators battled President George W. Bush's administration before launching presidential bids of their own in the 2008 contest. \n \n Grassley hadn't even introduced Kavanaugh by name when Harris interjected, objecting to the late Monday night release of Kavanaugh's documents. Harris has created a number of viral moments with her tough questioning of witnesses during her first term and quickly noted lawmakers hadn't had a chance to \"review or read or analyze\" the papers. \n \n \"You're out of order. I'll proceed,\" Grassley responded, banging his gavel. \n \n Said Harris: \"We cannot possibly move forward, Mr. Chairman, with this hearing.\" \n \n As Grassley tried to introduce Kavanaugh, Klobuchar called for the hearing to be postponed as the two senators attempted to talk over each other. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., jumped in, asking that the hearing be adjourned, prompting loud cheers and applause in the room. \n \n Kavanaugh, a veteran judge and a former aide to Bush, sat silently as the spectacle unfolded. \n \n Booker then appealed to Grassley's \"sense of decency and integrity,\" pushing for more transparency in the hearing. \n \n \"We are rushing through this process in a way that is unnecessary,\" Booker said. \n \n The three Democrats on the Judiciary Committee are considering whether to enter the presidential campaign following the November midterm elections along with other Senate Democrats not on the panel, such as Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Jeff Merkley of Oregon. \n \n Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who unsuccessfully battled Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, also is weighing another campaign. \n \n The field could include a number of Democratic governors, members of Congress, mayors and political newcomers along with familiar faces such as former Vice President Joe Biden, who appeared at a Labor Day parade in Pittsburgh on Monday as he tests the waters. \n \n Trump, even with his party facing a challenging midterm election, has relished the prospect of facing off against Democrats when the presidential campaign begins in earnest next year. \n \n The president didn't immediately respond to the Democrats' opposition to Kavanaugh on Tuesday. But he dismissed on Twitter the possibility of another prospective candidate, former Secretary of State John Kerry, Democrats' 2004 presidential nominee. \n \n \"I should only be so lucky,\" Trump tweeted on Monday, adding, \"although the field that is currently assembling looks really good - FOR ME!\" \n \n Republicans accused Democrats of politicizing the hearing and avoiding substance because they lack the votes to derail the nomination. \n \n \"It is about Democratic senators trying to re-litigate the 2016 election and just as importantly, working to begin litigating the 2020 presidential election,\" said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who unsuccessfully challenged Trump for the 2016 nomination. \n \n During the hearing, the room was filled by demonstrators shouting at Kavanaugh, a reminder of the bitterness against Trump's presidency and Democrats' outrage over the treatment of Merrick Garland, Obama's Supreme Court nominee, who was denied a hearing last year by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell before Trump's election. \n \n Minority Democrats are unable to delay a vote on Kavanaugh, making the confirmation process more of a demonstration of the party's warnings that he could help overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which established a woman's constitutional right to an abortion, or undermine health care or other Democratic priorities. \n \n Democrats are expected to press Kavanaugh on the issues when questioning begins on Wednesday. \n \n ___ \n \n On Twitter follow Ken Thomas at https://twitter.com/KThomasDC ||||| \u2022 Republicans praised Kavanaugh and expressed confidence he will be confirmed. \n \n Republicans used their opening statements to praise Judge Kavanaugh as highly qualified and a good man. They accused Democrats of hypocrisy and argued that his 12 years of appeals court rulings, which are public, are the best way to evaluate what kind of Supreme Court justice he would be. And, secure in the knowledge that they control the Senate and can confirmed the judge with a simple majority vote, Republicans expressed confidence that however unruly things get, the Senate will ultimately approve his appointment. \n \n \u2022 The hearing foreshadowed likely Democratic frustration in coming days. \n \n Democrats signaled in their opening statements that they intend to press Judge Kavanaugh to explain in detail what he thinks about contentious legal questions, especially whether the Roe v. Wade abortion rights decision was rightly decided \u2014 an issue that could illuminate whether he views it as settled precedent or vulnerable to overturning. But Republicans like Mr. Grassley said it would be inappropriate for him to indicate how he might rule on anything that might come before the court in the future. In his prepared opening statement, Judge Kavanaugh laid the groundwork for disclaiming that he will bring any ideological lens to interpreting ambiguous constitutional text, invoking the ideal of a judge as an \u201cumpire \u2014 a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy.\u201d \n \n The hearing is scheduled to resume at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, starting with questioning by Mr. Grassley and by Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat. Each senator on the committee will have 30 minutes in the first round of questioning and 20 in a second round, which is expected to wrap up on Thursday. Judge Kavanaugh would then be excused, and the senators will question a panel of legal experts who support and oppose his confirmation. \n \n Can\u2019t get enough? The rest of our dispatches from the day are below.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 One word keeps showing up in coverage of the first day of Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearing: \"chaos.\" (See here, here, and here.) Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas had a stronger phrase: \"mob rule,\" while Democrat Dick Durbin of Illinois heard the \"noise of democracy.\" Democrats were staging a unified front to try to keep the hearing from proceeding, angry about withheld documents from Kavanaugh's past, including his tenure in the George W. Bush White House. The release of more than 40,000 documents Monday night seems to have only made things worse, with Democrats arguing that it was humanly impossible to review them in time. Despite the Democrats' protests, Senate Judiciary Committee Charles Grassley says he will not stop the hearing, which is expected to last four days, reports Politico. Other developments: Arrests: Capitol Police arrested 22 protesters on disorderly conduct charges during the morning, reports the Washington Post. Handmaid's Tale: Women dressed as characters from the Handmaid's Tale were among the protesters outside the hearing room, notes the Huffington Post. See an image here. The costumes illustrate their concerns that Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court will be a setback for women's rights. Roe v. Wade: When the direct questions finally begin, Democrats are expected to press Kavanaugh on whether he'd be willing to overturn the ruling that legalized abortion, reports the New York Times. The question, said Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, is not whether he believes that Roe v. Wade is \u201csettled law,\u201d but \u201cwhether you believe it is the correct law.\u201d The judge's views on executive power and gun control also were expected to be examined. 2 views: The interruptions and chaos are about \"Democratic senators trying to re-litigate the 2016 election and just as importantly, working to begin litigating the 2020 presidential election,\" said Republican Ted Cruz, per the AP. But Democrat Patrick Leahy wondered, \u201cWhat are we trying to hide? Why are we rushing?\u201d Excerpts: Read excerpts of Kavanaugh's eventual opening statement here via MarketWatch. \"A good judge must be an umpire\u2014a neutral and impartial arbiter who favors no litigant or policy,\" Kavanaugh is to say. \"I don\u2019t decide cases based on personal or policy preferences. I am not a pro-plaintiff or pro-defendant judge. I am not a pro-prosecution or pro-defense judge. I am a pro-law judge.\"",

Kamala Harris of California and other Democrats called for the hearing to be delayed, arguing that Kavanaugh was being withheld records from his time in the Bush White House. \"We cannot possibly move forward, Mr. Chairman, with this hearing,\" said Harris.

Kavanaugh, for his part, said the court \"must never, never be viewed as a partisan institution,\" the AP reports. He promised to be a \"team player\" on the court and said he would \"always act in the best interest of the American people.\" He also said he would not be \"invited to make political or personal attacks in the heat of a political campaign.\" The first of at least four days of hearings is expected to end with a Senate vote.",

    "document": "(Aaron Schock is challenging you to lose weight and get healthier this summer. Take the Fit for Life Summer Challenge and see the program that will help you drop 10, 20, or 30 pounds and slash your risk of heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and many other diseases dramatically!) \n \n \"When I first saw it I kind of laughed,\" Schock says of Horton's training regimen. \"I didn't think you could get a real workout from a DVD. But at 6:30 a.m., it helps to have somebody talking you through your workout.\" \n \n For a Washington politician, Aaron Schock's approach to governing is as unconventional as his approach to fitness. That's not because of his policy positions\u2014he's a party-line Republican with a middle-class, Rust Belt background. And it's not because of his controversial statements and stances\u2014his biggest national showdown involved a chummy ride on Air Force One during which President Barack Obama lobbied him to vote for the stimulus bill. (Schock politely declined.) And given that he's at least half a decade too young to run for the presidency, nobody fears his entry into the race for the White House in 2012 (or 2016, for that matter). No, what makes Aaron Schock so different in the Washington world is that he's committed to helping his generation embrace health and fitness as a personal responsibility\u2014and he's doing it not just with words, but actions. \n \n To understand just how unusual Schock's body politic is, consider this: The average age of a member of Congress is 57. The combined age of the two U.S. senators representing Hawaii is 172. Schock\u2014the first U.S. rep born in the 1980s\u2014is young enough to be the son of most of his peers, and the grandson of many. When Michigan congressman John Dingell was celebrating his 25th year in office, Schock was still in utero. And Schock has already been in politics for longer than a decade; he won his first election at 19, as a write-in candidate for a position on his local school board. His candidacy was an act of protest against the board's decision to prevent him from graduating early; he trounced his opponent with 60 percent of the vote. \n \n \n \n Schock's apple-pie looks serve only to emphasize his youth; combine that with his conservative views and it's hard to miss his resemblance to a certain Alex P. Keaton. \"The biggest misconception people have about me is that when they see how young I am, they think, 'Oh, this guy must have always wanted to be in politics, his parents must have been politically connected,' \" Schock says. \"I'm a finance major and always intended to go into business. We would read the newspaper at home, but that was about as politically involved as my family got. I'd never even been to the state capital until I joined the school board.\" \n \n But instead of shrinking from the two characteristics that Ronald Reagan famously described as liabilities\u2014his \"youth and inexperience\"\u2014Schock embraces them. And that's perhaps his most radical position. He feels a special responsibility to young people, and he's focused on major issues that will affect his own generation the most: energy and the environment, the budget deficit, spiraling health-care costs, and a growing obesity crisis. He notes that members of Congress in their 60s, 70s, and 80s won't be around to suffer the consequences of their misguided policies, while Schock and his generation will feel the negative effects of bad policy for the rest of their lives. Schock is a committed deficit hawk who favors tax incentives to spur investment in alternative energy and infrastructure; but his greatest personal investments are in two areas: obesity and health-care costs. \n \n In fact, this month Schock is launching an initiative\u2014the Fit for Summer, Fit for Life challenge to help Americans take control of their health. (To sign up, go to MensHealth.com/schock.) \n \n \"One of my favorite quotes is from Ben Franklin, who said, 'A good example is the best sermon,' \" Schock says. \"And I think if you want to start talking about healthy lifestyles and staying in shape, then you yourself should do your best to try to be a model, an example to people you're trying to convince to do the same.\" \n \n And model he does. When he strolls into a New York City studio for his photo shoot, Schock isn't sporting the typical boxy clothes that Beltway insiders wear in order to hide what's stretching their belts. Instead, he's decked out in a form-fitting Zegna suit and tapered shirt that show off both his musculature and his fashion savvy. He looks more like a hit man from a European spy thriller than a boring politician. \n \n In other words, Aaron Schock is pretty fly for a Republican from Peoria. For much of the past few decades, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama have laid claim to cool for the Democrats. Aaron Schock might just steal it back.Pumping Iron in a Pressure Cooker \n \n Schock's lead-by-example ethos is a nonpartisan position. \"I think Michelle Obama is on the right track with her Let's Move campaign to bring down childhood obesity,\" he says. \"She and I come from the same state, Illinois, which is number four in the nation for obese children. One out of five Illinois children are considered obese. Not overweight, obese. And two-thirds of Americans are either overweight or obese. When people hear that, they're shocked, and rightfully so.\" \n \n But Schock isn't one of those lifelong fitness buffs who think we all have 2 hours a day to spend in the gym. He was a scrawny, sports-averse kid in high school. Fitness was never part of his original game plan. \"I didn't start working out until college,\" Schock says. \"But in college I could feel my body changing, and I knew that if I didn't make some changes, I was going to go in the wrong direction.\" So he understands that for an American public struggling with body issues, a health club can be an intimidating place. \n \n \"A lot of people don't think they have the time or the knowledge [to become physically fit], or they feel embarrassed to walk into a gym for the first time,\" he admits. \"It takes courage to walk into a gym and ask for help, and say, 'Hey, I want to lose some weight and get in shape.' \" Schock's strategy was to build muscle as a way of keeping fat at bay; he's bulked up from 145 pounds in college to his current weight of 165. \n \n Maintaining a physique like Schock's isn't easy under any circumstance, but in the constantly bubbling pressure cooker of politics, it's particularly daunting. Consider, for example, an underreported phenomenon in Washington: the hors d'oeuvres horror show. \n \n \n \n Since 2007 it's been illegal for lobbyists to treat U.S. reps to meals. Yet in the fungible world of Washington, legislators and industry reps have found a compromise: If it's on the end of a toothpick, it's not a meal. So healthconscious pols like Schock now run a gauntlet of Inigo Montoya wannabes who wield tiny wooden sabers in an effort to curry favor and influence policy. \n \n \"You can pack a lot of calories on the end of a toothpick,\" Schock insists. \"You have a drink and a few hors d'oeuvres and you've just downed hundreds of calories.\" If you're health conscious, it's an issue. So Schock doubles down on exercise. \n \n \"Exercise is more important than diet for me because it's a twofer. It keeps me in good physical shape, and it relieves stress. And when you're a representative of the public, there's never a shortage of things to do.\" \n \n Future Schock \n \n Schock's approach to health care may be to turn the political issue into a personal one, but that's his stance on a lot of things. Indeed, the congressman places a tremendous amount of faith in the notion that planning, discipline, and a little elbow grease can solve just about any problem. \"My advice to people in my age group is to think strategically,\" he says. \" 'Someday I would like to...retire, have children, change careers, start a business...' All of these take planning. Think about what you'd like to do, and then think about what it's going to take to get you there.\" \n \n That's exactly the way he wishes the government behaved. \"It's all about long-term strategic thinking, which doesn't happen enough in Washington,\" he says. \"What's frustrating is that there's not enough attention and engagement in politics from people in my generation, and they will benefit or suffer the most from the government decisions that are being made now. President Eisenhower had a vision for the future and made a bold decision to create our interstate highway system from scratch. Imagine if our government at that time was shortsighted and focused only on the next year. We desperately need long-term strategies on energy, health, education, and a fresh water supply 20 years from now. Too much thinking in Washington focuses on immediate crises at the expense of long-term strategic objectives. That is the biggest overriding failure of American government in the past 20 years. \n \n \"The big issue for young people is America's competitiveness,\" Schock says. In addition to a growing national debt and an expanding national waistline, here's a list of issues he wishes other people in their 20s would become more concerned about. \n \n Energy independence \n \n \"There is nothing more dangerous than relying on foreign countries for energy.\" He points to France as an example of a nation that set a goal\u2014to generate all its own electricity\u2014and has nearly reached it. \"I am all for doing whatever possible to get to a greater degree of energy independence as quickly as we can,\" Schock says, \"with an understanding that it's a short game\u2014we have to develop renewable energy in the long run.\" \n \n Clean water \n \n \"Outside of this country, it's a huge problem. But already in the state of Georgia there are communities where wells are drying up,\" he says. \"It's happening in Florida, California, and the American West, too. And we don't have a long-term strategy for how we're going to manage this.\" \n \n Education \n \n \"We're not producing enough math and science majors for our companies to hire. It's not about spending more, it's about spending more wisely and being open minded about adapting to successful teaching methods. How economically competitive in the world our country will be in the future depends on the quality of education in America. It's that simple and that important.\" \n \n \n \n But these problems are not insurmountable, he insists. Schock, an irrepressible optimist, believes that success in politics looks exactly like success in the gym: have a goal, a strategy, and be disciplined in making it happen. \n \n And what does Aaron Schock see as his personal long-term goal? Might he one day be among those senior senators serving well into their 80s? \"People ask me where I see myself in 10 years. Well, 10 years ago I was in high school,\" he laughs. \n \n \"Public service is a great honor, but it tends to be all-consuming,\" Schock says. \"When I look at that Capitol dome and no longer feel that tingle, then I'll know it's time to go.\" \n \n The Schock-Your-Body Workout \n \n Want tricked-out traps? Dominating delts? Abs the size of a woman's fist? And all while holding down a high-stress day job? Set your alarm a little earlier, and try Rep. Aaron Schock's workout routine. \n \n 5 to 7 days a week, choose from... \n \n *a 60-to 75-minute P90X training session \n \n *a 60-to 75-minute weight routine, focusing on high-weight, low-rep exercises, and alternating upper-and lower-body days \n \n *3 sets of 30 pushups and 30 situps; plus a run (5 miles) or swim (1 mile) ||||| Rep. Aaron Schock: 'Hottest freshman' in Congress pushes beyond his media-friendly profile \n \n Already busy in committees, Schock 'has already established himself as a leader,' House GOP whip says \n \n Aaron Schock hasn't wanted for attention since being elected to the House of Representatives last fall as a 27-year-old from Illinois. He has bounced from Stephen Colbert's show to CNN, while his own videos go viral on YouTube. \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 He is the Republican \"Dream Date,\" a smooth-speaking, polished product of Peoria, as comfortable with Facebook as a face-to-face. John McCain's daughter gushed over him as the future of the party. Readers of the liberal Webzine Huffington Post voted him the hottest freshman in Congress. TMZ trails him like a pop star. \n \n Much of the interest stems from his unlined face and full head of brown hair. (He recently brushed aside a request from host Howard Kurtz on CNN that he take off his jacket and show more of his physique.) \n \n Schock offers an alternative to the GOP tent poles, such as McCain, House Republican leader John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate. \n \n Other GOP fresh faces include Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Rep. Eric Cantor of Virginia. But Schock can top them all in one respect: He's Capitol Hill's first Reagan Baby, born while the Republican lodestar was in his first term. Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.), the House's longest-serving member, had been in Congress for 26 years when Schock was born. At 82, he's 55 years Schock's senior. \n \n Congress is one place where the simple quality of being young is newsworthy. The average age of a member of Congress this session is 57. But away from the Beltway, the young dominate the culture. The NBA's LeBron James is 24. Golfer Tiger Woods is 33. Arguably the hottest author in America, Stephanie Meyer of the \"Twilight\" series, is 35. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is 24. Millionaires, all. \n \n But in his world, Schock remains an outlier. And he is prepared to take full advantage of that. Other politicos might be mortified -- or feel trivialized -- if they are ambushed by TMZ's cameras or win a \"most attractive\" poll. But for the media-centric Schock, it's all about keeping the channel open. \n \n \"First, you've got to get their attention,\" Schock said last week outside the House chamber before he entered for a vote on the budget. \"Step one in getting anyone's vote is getting their attention.\" \n \n That may be part of the long-term plan. Schock's Internet reputation belies his serious, even wonky approach to his new job. On Thursday, he hosted a conference call for reporters to discuss his plan for a payroll tax holiday for small businesses. At his request, he serves on three committees, more than most freshmen are allowed in their first term. \n \n He has joined the Republican Study Committee, a home for deficit hawks. This week, he will go on his first overseas congressional trip. (The location is undisclosed because of security concerns.) \n \n Cantor, the House's rising Republican strategist and party whip, named Schock a deputy whip, making him part of the leadership team. Already, he has campaigned for other Republicans, such as Jim Tedisco in the special congressional election held in upstate New York last week. (Balloting in that race was so close that the winner is not yet known.) \n \n Cantor calls Schock one of his \"young guns\" and said, \"In only a few short months in Washington, he has already established himself as a leader.\"",

Keaton. \"The biggest misconception people have about me is that when they see how young I am, they think, 'Oh, this guy must have always wanted to be in politics, his parents must have been politically connected,'\" Schock tells Men's Health. \"I'm a finance major and always intended to go into business.

For cold temperatures, it's the nation's midsection, from Montana east to Wisconsin all the way south to northern Texas. \n \n What's the forecast? \n \n It's going to be awfully cold in the Plains and High Plains -- as much as 40 degrees below average in some places, according to the National Weather Service. In Helena, Montana, for instance, Wednesday's high is forecast to be 3 degrees below zero. That compares with 2 degrees on Tuesday and the average high of 36. \n \n Snowy, icy conditions are expected from eastern Missouri into the Mid-Atlantic states and New England. Up to 2 inches of snow per hour may fall around Boston, with as much as a foot of snow predicted in parts of Massachusetts. \n \n Who's being affected? \n \n In New York, where heavy snows are taxing salt reserves, Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared an emergency for the entire state and shut down Interstate 84. \n \n \"New Yorkers in affected regions should stay off the roads, check on their neighbors and loved ones, and stay inside their homes until the worst of the storm has passed,\" he said in a statement. \n \n Transportation regulators waived rest rules for salt-truck drivers to get remaining salt stockpiles moved to where they are needed: New York City and Long Island. \n \n In Pennsylvania, Villanova University announced that it would be closed Thursday and Friday after the school's power provider projected an extended outage in the area. \n \n And in Kansas, authorities announced a third weather-related death from the storm: a 58-year-old man died overnight after a traffic accident Tuesday, the Kansas Highway Patrol said. \n \n In Boston, the weather seemed little nuisance. \n \n CNN iReporter Jenifer Schwartz, visiting from California, marveled at how the city handled the storm. \n \n \"My flight home today is one of the many that was canceled, but getting a cab this morning to get to meetings around the city did not prove to be too much of a problem,\" she said. \n \n Relative Boston newcomer and native Southerner Josh Parsons was just trying to process it all. \n \n \"Since this is my first winter in the North, the snow still feels like a novelty to me,\" he told CNN on Wednesday. \"I enjoy seeing it falling and enjoy walking around in it right after the fresh snow. Having said that, I do not like some of the things that come along with the snow.\" \n \n Such as? Salt, slush and the simple fact all the snow just won't go away. \n \n \"The roads get cleared, the sidewalks get cleared, but then there are just mounds or brown, dirty ice piled up everywhere,\" he said. \n \n Meanwhile, in Michigan, two Delta Air Lines aircraft got stuck in the snow in unrelated incidents at Detroit Metro Airport. \n \n This comes a day after a Southwest Airlines plane hit a snowbank as it was taxiing to a gate in Kansas City, Missouri, according to airline spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger. \n \n Nationwide, airlines had canceled nearly 2,800 flights, according to flight tracking website Flightaware.com. \n \n Most-affected among major airports include New Jersey's Newark Liberty International, New York's LaGuardia and Boston Logan International. \n \n The Federal Aviation Administration also reported significant delays at airports in Chicago, Philadelphia and Charlotte, North Carolina. \n \n Why all the severe weather this winter? \n \n Boston is about 8 inches ahead of its normal snowfall pace for the year, the National Weather Service said. In New York, the number is 23 inches. \n \n It's not unusual or unprecedented, Radley Horton, a climate scientist with Columbia University, told CNN's New Day. \n \n \"If we look at winters in the past, we can get this kind of setup with a very wavy jet stream. Colder air spills into one side (while) the other side of the country has extremely warm weather,\" he said. \n \n But climate change -- particularly the way melting Arctic sea ice may be affecting jet stream patterns -- could be increasing the frequency and severity of such wild weather rides, he said. \n \n \"There's always going to be variability,\" Horton said. \"There's always going to be these waves in the jet stream. But it does seem, according to some research, as we lose that sea ice in the Arctic, one possible surprise could be more cold air spilling south, more warm air going north.\" ||||| East Coast Weekend Snow May Come in Two Waves \n \n By By Alex Sosnowski, senior meteorologist. February 06, 2014, 5:49:29 AM EST \n \n As the latest winter storm delivers a swath of snow reaching more than 1,500 miles at midweek, another snowstorm is being monitored for this weekend. \n \n The timing of the storm as it travels from the Rockies and Southwest is Saturday to Sunday over the Central states and Sunday to Monday in the East. \n \n The upcoming storm could be the most intense, and correspondingly the most disruptive, of the recent barrage especially as the storm nears and moves along the Atlantic coast. \n \n @erikmwalker tweeted: \"More news is snow news? Some computer models say flurries Sunday night; Others predict doom-filled epic storm\" Additional Relevant Tweets and Social Media Reaction \n \n This is provided the storm does not have competition with another storm nearby. \n \n The snow this weekend could affect major hubs in the East, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Washington and Boston into Monday's morning commute. \n \n Many airlines may still be trying to catch up and get back on schedule in the wake of the recent storms. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Single-Storm Scenario \n \n One scenario suggests the storm may develop into a blizzard as it nears the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, people from Virginia to Maine will need to watch this one carefully. \n \n If the storm develops to its full potential along the mid-Atlantic coast, it may deliver not only snowfall rates of several inches per hour to inland areas of the Northeast, but also strong winds. \n \n RELATED: \n \n AccuWeather.com Winter Weather Center \n \n Latest Watches, Warnings, Advisories \n \n Sneaky Snow Possible in the East Saturday \n \n These winds would cause extensive blowing and drifting snow over the central Appalachians to New England with local whiteout conditions. A period of strong onshore winds would bring coastal flooding and beach erosion over the upper mid-Atlantic to eastern New England. A return flow from the west would bring cold air back in quickly to the coast. \n \n New England and the Maritimes have the best chance of a period of windswept snow Sunday into Monday. \n \n The Two-Storm Scenario \n \n Another scenario would be for the storm to behave more like other storms have done recently with a period of light to moderate snow streaking across part of the Midwest to part of the Northeast. Winds would be significantly less and probably not a factor. Overall, a more manageable snowfall would occur. \n \n Supporting this less intense storm idea on Sunday to Monday is a front-running and weaker storm that will roll across the South on Friday night with rain showers and then could brush the Northeast on Saturday with a swath of snow. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Recall that a similar sneaky storm brought over 6 inches of snow to parts of the Northeast this past Monday. \n \n According to Senior Meteorologist Mark Mancuso, \"With so many storms on the playing field, the atmosphere may not have the energy available to allow the Sunday to Monday storm to become a major event until it has bypassed the United States.\" \n \n With this latter scenario, there would be two weaker storms, rather than one very strong system. \n \n Either way, it appears another episode of travel disruptions and concern for daily activities will sweep from the Central states to the East Coast. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In both scenarios, rain would fall across the Deep South and some snow would sweep across part of the southern Plains during Saturday night and the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachians on Sunday. A period of snow would also streak eastward across the Midwest cities of St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, Cincinnati and Cleveland. \n \n However, a stronger storm would imply more thunderstorm activity and a greater risk for severe weather in part of the Southeastern states. \n \n The details on the nature of storm for this weekend will unfold in the coming days. \n \n More Storms Beyond This Weekend \n \n According to Senior Meteorologist Henry Margusity, \"The Sunday to Monday weather event will not mark an end to the stormy pattern. Additional storms are on deck through at least the middle of February.\" \n \n Another storm may affect part of the eastern third of the nation with snow and rain around Valentine's Day. \n \n Report a Typo ||||| More than 500,000 Philadelphia-area homes and businesses are without power this morning, as freezing rain and flooding caused tree limbs to crack, snap or topple over utility poles - also helping to make the morning commute treacherous. By mid-morning, PECO figures already showed that the storm was among the utility's worst outage incidents ever. Gov. Tom Corbett said at a noon press conference that utility crews from out of state would be called in to help with the wide-spread outages. He said as Pennsylvania energy companies had received some 750,000 calls so far, but his office had yet to declare a state of emergency. \"We're going to continue to monitor the situation,\" Corbett said. \"Our major concern is that it is supposed to go below freezing tonight. It's going to refreeze tonight and we want everyone to be careful on the roads.\" \n \n Emergency crews in Philadelphia, Montgomery, Bucks, Chester and Delaware counties were busy responding to calls most of the morning, with some hampered by slick roads, downed trees and live lines that had fallen to the ground. Utility crews restored power to some areas as others were going dark. \n \n Bucks County dispatchers said they were too swamped with calls to verify police radio reports of a tree that had fallen into a home in Warminster with possible injuries. \n \n Conditions varied widely with temperatures hovering near freezing -- a few degrees on either side. That appears to have made a difference. Suburbs north and west of Philadelphia faced slick conditions and widespread power outages, while South Jersey, although covered in plenty of ice, was warm enough that roads were mostly wet. \n \n \"Far north, far west, that's where you're having the biggest problems from the icing,\" Jeffrey Knueppel, a SEPTA deputy general manager, said at a news briefing. \n \n Postman John Woodring wasn't deterred by the conditions. Wearing a white pith helmet to keep the melting ice off his wool watch cap, Woodring trudged through what remained of the nearly 11 inches of snow that fell earlier in the week in Cheltenham, Montgomery County. \n \n He carefully avoided paved surfaces, favoring paths where he could hear the comforting crunch of snow underfoot. He was taking precautions to avoid slips, or worse, breaking a leg, he said. \n \n \"I'll be taking baby steps, dodging falling branches,\" Woodring said. \"I couldn't go fast if I wanted to!\" \n \n Power \n \n PECO's online outage map was showing that about 595,000 customers were without power in the Philadelphia area as of around noon. Outages were most widespread in Chester County, with more than 181,000 customers lacking power. That was followed by more than 180,000 customers impacted in Montgomery County, 138,000 in Bucks County, 67,000 in Delaware County and 27,000 in Philadelphia. \n \n Outages were fewer in South Jersey. PSE&G was reporting that Burlington County was the hardest hit, with about 8,000 customers there lacking power. \n \n Transportation \n \n Several SEPTA Regional Rail lines halted service this morning: The West Trenton Line is suspended due to a CSX train derailment, the Paoli-Thorndale and Cynwyd lines are suspended due to Amtrak power issues and the Warminster Line is suspended due to signal problems. Passengers should expect delays of up to 40 minutes on Regional Rail trains system-wide. \n \n Some SEPTA bus routes are being detoured. \n \n New Jersey Transit said rail, bus and light rail tickets would be cross-honored system-wide. \n \n Amtrak suspended Keystone Service between Philadelphia and Harrisburg due to numerous weather-related issues. \n \n Reduced speed limits are in place on the New Jersey Turnpike: 35 mph between exit 8 and the George Washington Bridge and 50 mph between exits 3 and 8. \n \n PennDOT imposed speed restrictions on major highways for much of the morning rush, but normal speed limits were restored around 9 a.m. \n \n Downed trees were causing traffic disruptions and lane closures on major roads throughout the morning. \n \n Several dozen flights were canceled or delayed at Philadelphia International Airport, according to FlightAware.com. \n \n As the lingering mounds of snow melt into already saturated ground, flooding was also a possibility in many areas. \n \n Schools \n \n School closures did not appear to be widespread. In those areas hardest hit by the ice some districts did close, such as Cheltenham. Philadelphia schools were already scheduled to be closed for classes with only staff expected to report. \n \n However, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia and many suburban school districts were opening later than usual. For example, Lower Merion Township. and Cherry Hill schools were opening two hours late. The archdiocese schools are operating on a one-hour delay. \n \n Some universities are also closing or operating on delayed schedules. Temple University, for instance, was opening at 10 a.m., and Rutgers campuses will open at noon. Villanova and West Chester universities, as well as the Montgomery County Community College are closed. \n \n Government \n \n Government offices in Bucks, Chester and Montgomery counties are closed today. \n \n Delaware County government facilities are opening two hours late. \n \n Philadelphia city offices are operating normally, though traffic courts are opening two hours late. \n \n Gov. Chris Christie has declared a state of emergency in New Jersey. State offices are closed for nonessential employees. \n \n Other \n \n Some major attractions are also closed or opening late. The Philadelphia Zoo is closed to the public. The Philadelphia Museum of Art is opening at noon and the Constitution Center is opening at 11 a.m. \n \n Forecast \n \n The National Weather Service is calling for a mix of freezing rain and sleet before 1 p.m., with a chance of rain after that and a high of 38. So much of this morning's precipitation should melt. No real snow accumulation is expected. \n \n Check back for details as they develop. ||||| More than 3,000 flights were cancelled after the Northeast was socked Wednesday with a winter storm packing snow, freezing rain and ice. \n \n The storm, which arrived after causing similar havoc in the Midwest the day before, left anywhere from a few inches to a foot -- or more -- of snow up the coast, along with the freezing rain that makes driving treacherous. \n \n The inclement weather adds to what's already been a weary winter for the Northeast, and comes days after a major winter storm buried some parts of the region in nearly a foot of snow. \n \n The website FlightAware.com said 3,198 flights were cancelled on Wednesday, along with nearly 12,000 delays. \n \n Most of the cancelled flights were from the New York-area airports, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Washington. Regional airline Cape Air alone cancelled more than 200 flights, including nearly every flight planned from airports in Massachusetts. \n \n Along with travel disruptions, the storm also cut electricity to hundreds of thousands of customers in the region. Nearly 750,000 customers in Pennsylvania were left in the dark by the storm's wrath, with a major utility company telling residents power could remain out until the weekend. \n \n In Connecticut, the start of the state's General Assembly annual session was delayed until Thursday due to the snow. Nearly a foot of snow buried Massachusetts, schools were largely cancelled across Rhode Island, and rail service out of Washington, D.C. on Wednesday afternoon was limited. \n \n Across the nation, residents struggled to carry on despite the storm. \n \n \"I wish that groundhog would have stayed in its hole,\" said Geoff Dunn, who took the bus to his downtown Columbus, Ohio, office, avoiding the messy roads but still having to navigate snowy sidewalks. \"Finding us six more weeks of winter was not the smart move.\" \n \n In Chicago, a runner was credited with helping save a man who fell into icy Lake Michigan with his dog. \n \n Adam Dominik says he found twine and anchored it around himself while throwing the other end in the water, pulling the man onto nearby rocks. Meanwhile, a skier called 911. He was taken to a hospital to be treated for severe hypothermia. He and his dog are expected to recover. \n \n In Michigan, authorities reported several multi-vehicle crashes Wednesday after several inches of snow along Interstate 94 in the Jackson area, including some with injuries, and crashes closed portions of I-69 in the Flint area. \n \n And for those looking for a respite, more bad news is on the way, as authorities predict another walloping winter storm is poised to slam into the region Saturday night into Sunday. \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

In the docs they say she threatened to go to tabloids if her demands are not met. \n \n They don't mention a specific dollar amount she's allegedly trying to get. \n \n According to the docs ... Alan got rich and famous long before meeting Callau, and they signed a prenup when they wed in 2005. The sons say she's threatening to challenge the prenup. \n \n The sons say Tanya also wants more because she claims to have given up her own career to support Alan and help raise his youngest son, Carter. \n \n According to docs ... the boys say their dad left Tanya 25 percent of his personal effects, 40 percent of his remaining estate, a $500k life insurance policy and said she could live at the ranch. \n \n Robin and Brennan want a judge to enforce the will and the prenup. ||||| The actor's children say they have no choice but to protect their father's legacy from the \"avarice and overreaching\" of his third wife. \n \n America's dearly departed favorite dad Alan Thicke is at the center of what is shaping up to be a dramatic family fight, as his two oldest sons are taking his wife to court over his estate. \n \n Brennan and Robin Thicke are co-trustees of Thicke's living trust. They say they've been left with no choice but to file a petition in order to \"honor the memory of their father, protect his legacy, and prevent his testamentary intentions from being undermined by avarice and overreaching of his third wife, Tanya Callau.\" \n \n Thicke died suddenly in December at age 69, after his aorta ruptured while playing hockey with his son Carter. \n \n The older sons claim their father acquired the vast majority of his wealth long before meeting Callau, who signed a prenuptial agreement ahead of their 2005 marriage. \n \n In the trust, Thicke left each of his three children equal shares of a Carpinteria ranch, 75 percent of his personal effects and 60 percent of his remaining estate, according to the petition. He left Callau the ranch's furnishings, 25 percent of his personal effects, a $500,000 life insurance policy, all of his death benefits from pensions and union memberships and 40 percent of his remaining estate. He also provided that she could live at the ranch, as long as she paid for its expenses and maintained the property. \n \n Now, Thicke's sons claim Callau is insisting that the prenup she signed is invalid. \n \n According to the petition filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court, Thicke updated his trust from time to time, and the most recent iteration was signed in February 2016. It designated his brother Todd as the trustee, and left the estate in the hands of his children if Todd declined the role \u2014 which he did. Brennan and Robin say Callau made no complaints about the prenuptial agreement or the estate plan at that time. \n \n \"Now that Alan is dead, Tanya claims there are numerous problems with the Trust and the Prenuptial Agreement,\" writes attorney Alex Weingarten in the petition. \"Tanya asserts that there is no chance the 'Prenup' could withstand legal challenge and that she has very significant community rights in the Trust\u2019s assets and rights of reimbursement with respect to improvements to the Ranch. Tanya also claims 'Marvin rights' asserting that she had to forgo opportunities to pursue and advance her own career in order to support Alan and be his companion and partner, including raising Carter.\" \n \n Weingarten also claims Thicke's wife has \"threatened to make her claims fodder for 'tabloid publicity' unless the Co-Trustees agreed to participate in a mediation and succumb to her demands.\" \n \n The Thickes are asking the court for instructions concerning the extent to which the Trust's property is the actor's separate property and whether Callau's challenge to the prenup is barred because she waived her community property rights when signing it. \n \n \"My clients made every effort to resolve this without the need for going to court,\" Weingarten tells The Hollywood Reporter. \"The only thing they care about is protecting the legacy of their father and honoring his intentions. That is exactly what we are going to do.\" \n \n The widow's attorney Adam Streisand sent THR a statement Tuesday evening. \"Tanya Thicke has never threatened to take private family matters public and she never has,\" he says. \"It is clear that Alan\u2019s sons have chosen this distasteful public smear tactic to bully Tanya, by stirring up the tabloid media, filing a bogus lawsuit, and refusing family mediation. Tanya is still grieving the death of her beloved husband and out of respect for Alan\u2019s memory intends to handle his son\u2019s false statements privately.\" \n \n May 16, 6:00 p.m. Updated with a statement from Tanya Callau Thicke's attorney.",

Thicke left much of his estate to his three children, but Callau still inherited a significant amount (the Hollywood Reporter has the exact breakdown) and was allowed to continue living on his Carpinteria, Calif., ranch. Thicke's sons say their father acquired most of his wealth before meeting Callau, and that she signed a prenup prior to marrying Thicke.

Yet it\u2019s this image that finally allowed a medical team to understand why the child was vomiting and fatigued and ultimately save his life. \n \n Hanhang, 1, was walking around with a chopstick when he tripped and fell, according to CEN. \n \n The long stick drove up his nose and his parents quickly removed the object and took him to the hospital. \n \n Doctors examined Hanhang and failed to notice that the chopstick had punctured the brain and small pieces were still lodged in his head. \n \n \u201cWhen we got home after our first visit to the hospital, my husband broke all the chopsticks in half and threw them away as we were worried something like this could happen again,\u201d Yu Liao, Hanhang\u2019s 25-year-old mom told CEN. \n \n \u201cBut we had no idea there was still one inside of his head,\u201d she said. \n \n At home, Hanhang\u2019s condition worsened as he repeatedly vomited and was noticeably lethargic. \n \n His parents brought him back to the hospital where doctors ordered an X-ray and discovered the chopstick piece. \n \n \u201cWe were beside ourselves with worry,\u201d Liao said. \n \n \u201cAfter removing the remaining six centimeters his condition improved immediately, but he does have a brain infection so will be staying in the hospital for further treatment,\u201d Dr. Li Shaovi told CEN. \n \n Kids and chopsticks can be a dangerous combination.

    "document": "A husband and wife returned home from a Caribbean cruise with identical souvenirs from their vacation: parasitic infections that caused itchy, red rashes on the couple's backsides, according to a report of their case. \n \n After sunbathing on a sandy beach in Martinique one afternoon, the wife said she felt a burning sensation on her rear end. By the next day, this irritation had blossomed into an extremely itchy rash with \"red pinprick marks,\" according to the report, which was published Jan. 13 in the journal BMJ Case Reports. \n \n The woman's husband also developed a rash on his backside after spending time with his wife on the beach. So, the British couple sought help from the medical staff on the cruise ship, who prescribed antibiotics and anti-fungal medications, as well as a steroid cream to relieve the rash and quell the itchiness, the report said. [8 Awful Parasite Infections That Will Make Your Skin Crawl] \n \n But these treatments didn't help, so when the couple returned home from the cruise, they went to the hospital. By this point, it had been 10 days since they'd sat on the Martinique beach. \n \n When doctors at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England, examined the 52-year-old woman, they saw a wavy, red rash on her bottom. Her husband had a similar-looking rash on his backside, and doctors diagnosed both of them with \"cutaneous larva migrans,\" according to the case report. \n \n This is a skin condition caused by a hookworm infection. The most common culprit for the infection in the Caribbean is the hookworm Ancylostoma braziliense, according to the case report. \n \n People can pick up the parasite after encountering hookworm larvae; these can be excreted in the feces of an infected animal, typically a dog or cat, onto sandy beaches or moist soil, the report said. \n \n A high percentage of dogs and cats are infected with hookworm, especially strays, said Dr. Peter Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who was not involved in the couple's case. When these animals defecate on the beach, hookworm larvae can easily migrate through the sand, he said. \n \n But Caribbean beaches aren't the only places you can find hookworms; some beaches along the Gulf Coast of the U. S. and the Atlantic seaboard may also be teaming with the parasites, Hotez told Live Science. [10 Ways the Beach Can Kill You] \n \n For a person to become infected with hookworm, there has to be direct contact between the skin and the larvae of the worm, Hotez said. That means that walking barefoot on contaminated beach may cause the infection. Hotez said he speculates that this couple may have sat bare-bottomed on the sand, or the sand may have gotten into their bathing suits. \n \n Once a hookworm larva penetrates a person's skin, it can burrow around, leaving a trail-like rash of inflamed skin known as a \"creeping eruption,\" Hotez said. Sometimes, the rash can have a winding appearance, as was the case for this couple, or sometimes it can look like lines on the skin, he noted. (The species of hookworm that is thought to have infected the couple can't reproduce in humans; as a result, when the worms infect humans, they typically burrow around in the skin until they die, Live Science previously reported.) \n \n Doctors prescribed anti-parasitic medication to the husband and wife, according to the report. But five days later, the woman went to the emergency room because she was experiencing shortness of breath, a dry cough and chest pain. Her husband also developed a dry cough. \n \n A small percentage of people with cutaneous larva migrans may get symptoms in their lungs, Hotez said. When this occurs, it means the larvae got into the bloodstream and were carried to the lungs, he said. \n \n A chest X-ray can show if the larvae have infiltrated the lungs, Hotez said. And indeed, there was evidence of this in both the man and the woman, according to the case report. \n \n Lung-related symptoms tend to happen when there is significant exposure to hookworm larvae, Hotez noted; in other words, a person would have to be infected with a large number of larvae. \n \n The couple was given a second dose of anti-parasitic medication, and the treatment quickly helped clear up their skin as well as their lungs, according to the case report. \n \n Originally published on Live Science. ||||| 1/50 27 February 2018 Icicles hang from a frozen elephant fountain in Colchester.

Hookworm was once widespread in the United States, particularly in the southeastern region, but improvements in living conditions have greatly reduced hookworm infections. Hookworm, Ascaris, and whipworm are known as soil-transmitted helminths (parasitic worms). Together, they account for a major burden of disease worldwide. \n \n Hookworms live in the small intestine. Hookworm eggs are passed in the feces of an infected person. If the infected person defecates outside (near bushes, in a garden, or field) of if the feces of an infected person are used as fertilizer, eggs are deposited on soil. They can then mature and hatch, releasing larvae (immature worms). The larvae mature into a form that can penetrate the skin of humans. Hookworm infection is mainly acquired by walking barefoot on contaminated soil. One kind of hookworm can also be transmitted through the ingestion of larvae. \n \n Most people infected with hookworms have no symptoms. Some have gastrointestinal symptoms, especially persons who are infected for the first time. The most serious effects of hookworm infection are blood loss leading to anemia, in addition to protein loss. Hookworm infections are treatable with medication prescribed by your health care provider. \n \n Image: L: Filariform (L3) hookworm larva in a wet mount.

Credit: DPDx ||||| Medical and scientific journals withdraw or retract articles on a regular basis, usually because of errors discovered or questions raised about the research described. A few days ago, however, a highly unusual \u201ccorrection\u201d appeared in the prestigious British Medical Journal announcing the withdrawal of a case study titled \u201cCutaneous larva migrans with pulmonary involvement.\u201d \n \n The article, which was not retracted, contained no errors. The BMJ simply said in the undated note that \u201cwith no admission of liability, BMJ has removed this article voluntarily at the request of the patient concerned.\u201d \n \n Here\u2019s what happened. \n \n While sunbathing on a beach in Martinique, a British woman suddenly felt a burning sensation on her backside. The next day, she woke up to find a nasty rash of \u201cred pinprick marks\u201d on her bottom. \n \n Soon her husband broke out with the same rash in the same unfortunate place. \n \n While they received treatment in Martinique in the form of steroid cream, antibiotics and antifungal medication, the irritation did not subside. The voyage home, 10 days on a cruise ship, must have been uncomfortable. \n \n Nor was the rash gone when they got home. \n \n So they went for treatment at Addenbrooke\u2019s Hospital in Cambridge, England. Doctors there found their backsides \u201cinfested by worms,\u201d as the Cambridge News reported. The couple found relief from a combination of medications. \n \n The doctors thought their case so interesting they wrote it up for the British Medical Journal. The journal did not use the name of the patients. But as journals often do in case studies, it accompanied the text with photos \u2014 in this case, of their backsides, from different angles, in full color. \n \n The couple gave their permission and were warned that journal articles were often read by journalists as well as medical professionals, the BMJ said in an email to The Washington Post. But the couple apparently had not anticipated the potential for tabloid interest. \n \n By mid-January, their buttocks were spread across Britain and, indeed the world, with headlines such as \u201cTil Rash Do Us Part\u201d in The Sun and \u201cCaribbean getaway leaves a nasty souvenir\u201d in the Daily Mail. \n \n These were not your typical titillating tabloid photos. They were shots from various distances of behinds bearing inflamed red blotches. \n \n Many tabloid readers found them gross. \n \n \u201cA description would have done,\u201d commented one reader of Britain\u2019s Daily Mail, adding that \u201cwe didnt need to see the evidence.\u201d \n \n \u201cDoes the DM pixelator have a day off today?!?,\u201d wrote another. \n \n \u201cThanks \u2014 that\u2019s put me right off my cheese & ham toastie,\u201d wrote a third. \n \n Like the journal article, the stories did not include the names of the patients or say where they lived or when they visited Martinique. \n \n But there was enough information \u2014 the age of the woman, the island, the cruise, the hospital \u2014 that the couple apparently felt that acquaintances conceivably could have made the connection. \n \n One of the patients \u2014 the journal didn\u2019t say which one \u2014 got in touch with BMJ and \u201cexplained that they were concerned about being identified by close friends and/or colleagues, as a result of the subsequent media coverage,\u201d the publication said in a statement emailed to The Post. \n \n \u201cPrior to publication of the article, written consent from the patient was obtained,\u201d said the statement. \u201cBy signing the consent form, the patient indicated their understanding that complete anonymity could not be guaranteed and it was also made clear in the consent form that BMJ publications are viewed by many non-doctors, including journalists.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe patient\u2019s concerns did not amount to a legal threat,\u201d it added. \u201c\u2026 Nevertheless, the journal took the editorial decision to remove the article, because of the distress the patient had suffered. \n \n \u201d \u2026 To be clear, the removal of the article does not amount to a retraction and the journal stands by its factual content.\u201d \n \n A spokesman for the hospital, part of Cambridge University Hospitals, also issued a statement: \u201cThe case study was shared with the BMJ with the aim of medical advancement, to aid other clinicians, and potentially help the treatment of future patients with similar conditions. Because the article was being picked up in nonmedical publications, a request was made for it to be removed.\u201d \n \n In fairness to the tabloids, there was some news and public service value to the stories useful to people planning on visits to tropical or subtropical beaches. \n \n The diagnosis, as described by Livescience, quoting the no-longer-accessible case study, was \u201ccutaneous larva migrans,\u201d otherwise known as a hookworm infection. \n \n According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, people pick up this nasty parasite from the feces of dogs and cats. If those dogs and cats leave their waste on a beach, sunbathers can contract the infection. \n \n In the case of the British couple, the infection found its way into their lungs, causing coughing, and in the woman, shortness of breath and pain. \n \n The advice from the CDC for those visiting such beaches: \u201cwear shoes and use protecting mats or other coverings to prevent direct skin contact with sand or soil.\u201d \n \n More from Morning Mix: \n \n Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf tipped off immigrants about ICE raid and isn\u2019t sorry she did \n \n Flawed drug tests used to remove scores of Canadian children from their parents, report finds",

But when that happened\u2014with headlines like \"His and Her Hookworm: Same Rash Strikes Couple on the Rear\"\u2014the pair had a change of heart. With the spread of photos and case details\u2014including the woman's age, the couple's Caribbean destination, the cruise line on which they traveled, and the Cambridge hospital they visited\u2014one of the pair asked that the article be withdrawn over concerns \"about being identified by close friends and/or colleagues,\" BMJ says. In what the Post calls a \"highly unusual 'correction,'\" the journal then announced it was pulling the article despite standing by its content. As the Independent reports, the article was meant to helpful in combating a lack of familiarity in the medical community with hookworm infections. According to the CDC, such infections can be passed through contact with soil or sand contaminated with feces. As the BMJ study explained, the British couple were infected when they sat on a sandy, and apparently unsanitary, beach.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 A couple who went on a Caribbean cruise ended up in the hospital after both developed rashes on their backsides, Live Science reports. According to a case report published in the journal BMJ Case Reports, the British couple spent 10 days on a sandy beach in Martinique before both developed a rash on their backsides. They went to the ship's medical staff, who prescribed antibiotics, anti-fungal medications, and a steroid cream in an attempt to ease the rash. But by the time the couple returned home, it was too late. Doctors diagnosed the couple with hookworm infection \"cutaneous larva migrans.\" This is a skin condition caused by a hookworm infection. The most common culprit for the infection in the Caribbean is the hookworm Ancylostoma braziliense. People can pick up the parasite after encountering hookworm larvae; these can be excreted in the feces of an infected animal, typically a dog or cat, onto sandy beaches or moist soil. Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, says the couple may have sat bare-bottomed on the beach, or the sand may have gotten into their bathing suits. Once a hookworm larva penetrates a person's skin, it can burrow around, leaving a trail-like rash of inflamed skin known as a \"creeping eruption.\" Symptoms can include shortness of breath, a dry cough, and chest pain. A small percentage of people with cutaneous larva migrans may also get symptoms in their lungs, Hotez says. The couple was given another dose of anti-parasitic medication, and their symptoms went away.",

Curtis Scaparrotti, who is also the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, did not elaborate to the Senate Armed Services Committee on what type of equipment the Taliban might have received or when. \n \n Any type of material support, however, would be a significant escalation of Russia's involvement with the Taliban; it has said in the past that it maintains only limited communication with the group. \n \n \"I've seen the influence of Russia of late, increased influence in terms of association and perhaps even supply to the Taliban,\" Scaparrotti said. \n \n Much to the chagrin of U.S. officials and military officers, Russia has justified its communications with the Taliban by saying the insurgent group is fighting the Islamic State in Afghanistan, not the U.S.-backed Afghan government. \n \n Army Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, has decried Russia's contact with the Taliban, saying that it has given cover to a group that has worked for years to undermine the United States and the government in Kabul. Russia fought its own bloody war of attrition in Afghanistan in the 1980s, pulling out after suffering heavy losses from U.S.-supplied insurgents. \n \n \"This public legitimacy that Russia lends to the Taliban is not based on fact,\" Nicholson told reporters in December. \n \n On Thursday, the district center of Sangin in Afghanistan's restive south province of Helmand was overrun by the Taliban after months of heavy fighting with Afghan forces backed by U.S. air support. In recent months, the Taliban has steadily increased control over large swaths of the country, prompting Nicholson to suggest that thousands more troops are needed to help better train the Afghan military and reverse the \"stalemate\" in the country. His assessment was subsequently echoed by Gen. Joseph Votel, the head of U.S. Central Command. \n \n Currently, about 5,000 NATO troops are in the country, in addition to the 8,400-strong American presence.

The space race was on, the Cold War fears had reached a fever pitch, and science-fiction movies like \"The Flying Saucer\" (1950) catapulted schlocky depictions of aliens and their flying machines into the popular consciousness. In fact, by 1953, UFO mania had reached such heights that the CIA marshaled a team of scientific consultants to investigate all of the reports and review the \"Unidentified Flying Object Problem,\" according to a 1953 memorandum by the agency. \n \n While most of these encounters were likely weird cloud formations, lightning or even missile tests rather than little green men, they still inspire countless conspiracy theories. From the flying frying pan of West Germany to the mysterious craft hovering over uranium mines in Africa, here are some of the CIA's most mysterious X-files. [7 Things Most Often Mistaken for UFOs] \n \n The flying pan of West Germany \n \n In 1952, Oscar Linke, the 48-year-old former mayor of Gleimershausen, Germany, and his 11-year-old daughter Gabriella were traveling home, when his tire blew out near the town of Hasselbach. His daughter noticed something in the distance, which he initially thought was a deer. \n \n When Linke got closer, however, he saw two men peering at what looked like a massive frying pan, between 42 and 49 feet (13 to 15 meters) in diameter, he reported. Around the rim were two rows of holes, each about 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter, and a large, conical tower, about 10 feet (3 m) high, loomed at the top of the object. \n \n When his daughter called back to him, she startled the two men, who immediately jumped inside the mysterious frying pan, according to the CIA report. \n \n One of the men, according to Linke, had a round protrusion on his chest that glowed green and then red. While he was watching, the conical structure fell down to the ground, the saucer began rising in the air and its rim was encircled with flames from below. Then, it turned horizontally and took off above the trees, disappearing into the distance. \n \n \"I would have thought that both my daughter and I were dreaming if it were not for the following element involved: When the object had disappeared, I went to the place where it had been. I found a circular opening in the ground, and it was quite evident that it was freshly dug. It was exactly the same shape as the conical tower,\" Linke testified to a West German judge at the time. \n \n Linke, who had recently escaped from East Germany, claimed he had never heard of flying saucers when in the Soviet Zone. He was convinced that the flying machine was a Soviet military apparatus. Other people in the area reported seeing what looked like a comet at the time. [Flying Saucers to Mind Control: 7 Declassified Military & CIA Secrets] \n \n Uranium mine surveys? \n \n That same year, in what was then the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), two fiery discs were spotted hovering over the uranium mines in the Elisabethville district, according to a news report from the local newspaper Die Presse. \n \n \"The disks glided in elegant curves and changed their positions many times, so that from below, they sometimes appeared as plates, ovals and simply lines,\" the article said. \n \n According to the article, Cmdr. Pierre, who worked at the Elisabethville airfield, pursued the two flying discs in a fighter plane, but gave up after 15 minutes. He said he estimated the discs were flying at 932 mph (1,500 km/h). The saucer zoomed off, disappearing over Lake Tanganyika. [Supersonic! The 10 Fastest Military Planes] \n \n According to Pierre, the discs were aluminum-colored metal, between 39 and 49 feet (12 to 15 m) in diameter, and had a central knob that seemed to stay absolutely still as the outer disc rotated at tremendous speeds. The outer circumference was \"veiled in fire,\" according to the report. Like the one in the previous report, this saucer seemed capable of flying both vertically and horizontally, and often \"shot down\" to within a few hundred feet of the treetops. The pilot thought it was unlikely that the mysterious machine was manned, as the disc's erratic motion and high heat would not allow someone to stay inside. (The dubious aerodynamics of such an object were not mentioned.) \n \n Though Pierre is noted as a reliable officer, no one else confirmed his sighting. Based on his report, however, the CIA produced a sketch of the purported saucer's dimensions and potential operating principles. \n \n Smoke trail over Barcelona \n \n It turned out that 1952 was a hot year for unidentified-object sightings. \n \n Several people reported seeing lightning-fast objects streaking through the sky over North Africa and Spain. For instance, newspaper reporter Valent\u00edn Garc\u00eda noticed a smoke trail coming from a strange, rocketlike object flying near Barcelona. After he reported on the object, his office was flooded with calls about the enigmatic object, and one of his friends even captured a photo of the smoke trail, Garc\u00eda reported. \n \n That same year, people in Sousse, Tunisia, reported seeing \"a flying object traveling at dizzying speed from west to east emitting a pale green light.\" \n \n And in Morocco, witnesses reported a flying saucer shooting silently through the sky. In comparison, the flights of nearby T-33 fighter planes seemed slow. The object traced a parabola in the sky, paused, and then streaked off toward a town in the south. \n \n The CIA did not release documents to show exactly how all of those investigations were resolved, but other documents suggest that most seem to be hoaxes or misidentified objects. \n \n In a 1953 report by a scientific advisory panel to investigate UFOs, agency officials noted that \"the Panel members were impressed by the lack of sound data in the great majority of case histories.\" \n \n For most of the cases, expert investigators uncovered reasonable explanations for the sightings, and for others, a process of induction suggested similar reports could be dismissed as well, the panel found. \n \n Follow Tia Ghose on Twitterand Google+.

That makes it broadcast's second-biggest scripted episode of the season, shy of Empire's sophomore premiere, and the highest-rated post-NFL conference championship episode of a scripted series in more than a decade. \n \n \n \n Night-of viewership for the episode was incredibly strong. It netted a 6.1 rating among adults 18-49 and 16.2 million viewers. With the time-shifting now added, the kick-off of The X-Files' six-part return actually fared better than the 2002 series finale. (That pre-DVR-era episode averaged a 6.3 rating in the key demo.) \n \n \n \n The X-Files also added 1.1 million viewers on Hulu. \n \n \n \n There's still the wait-and-see of how the second episode will perform. On the night it aired, it averaged a strong 3.2 rating among adults 18-49 and 9.7 million viewers. Fox execs, however, are likely anticipating bigger boosts when those live-plus-three day stats come in. \n \n",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 With the revival of The X-Files already proving to be one of 2016's most popular shows, everyone's jumping on the bandwagon, including the CIA. Fox News reports the CIA recently drew attention to some of the documents related to UFOs it first declassified in 1978. A blog post by the CIA highlights \"five documents we think X-Files character Agent Fox Mulder would love to use to try and persuade others of the existence of extraterrestrial activity\" and \"five documents we think his skeptical partner, Agent Dana Scully, could use to prove there is a scientific explanation for UFO sightings.\" The \"Mulder\" documents include 1952 UFO sightings in East Germany\u2014a father and daughter spotted a UFO in a field accompanied by two men in shiny suits (PDF here); Spain\u2014a newspaper office was \"flooded\" with calls about a smoke-trailing UFO (PDF here); and the Belgian Congo\u2014a fighter plane chased after two UFOs making inhumanly abrupt changes in course (PDF here). Most of the CIA's declassified UFO documents come from the 1940s and 1950s, and Live Science notes that this isn't a surprise as the imaginations of people at the time were running rampant with sci-fi movies, the space race, and the Cold War. In most of the reported cases, it adds, \"expert investigators uncovered reasonable explanations for the sightings,\" such as missile tests or cloud formations. Scully would be proud.

    "document": "Image copyright Posti Image caption Postal workers have volunteered to take part in the lawn-mowing initiative \n \n Finland's postal service will be doing more than just delivering letters and parcels this summer - its workers will be mowing lawns, too. \n \n The state-owned Posti company is offering a weekly grass cutting service, with customers able to choose either 30 minutes or 60 minutes of lawn-mowing time, the national broadcaster Yle reports. It will only be available on Tuesdays, though, as the volume of post tends to be lighter than on other days, and customers will have to provide their own lawnmower. They'll also have to be willing to pay 65 euro (\u00a351; $73) a month for the half-hour sessions. \n \n Posti has been looking for ways to tackle a falling demand for its mail services in recent years. Earlier this month it announced that delivery times would be extended into the evenings when people are usually at home. \n \n According to Anu Punola, a manager at the company, venturing into the world of gardening was a grassroots idea which came from postal workers themselves. \"We have genuinely tried to find services that would make people's lives easier,\" she says, adding that staff have volunteered to take part in the initiative. It will be available nationwide between May and August. \n \n At least one organisation isn't happy about the plan, though. The Real Estate Employers group, which represents property maintenance companies, says it's concerned that postal workers don't have the right skills. \"Using power-driven machinery and equipment requires a certain expertise,\" says managing director Pia Gramen. \"It is hard to believe that just anyone can start to cut lawns.\" \n \n Next story: Norway minister's Med stunt backfires \n \n Use #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter. ||||| Posti offers its new home services to the South Karelia Social and Health Care District \n \n 11.02.2016 \n \n Posti has launched the first municipal cooperation within Posti's new home services with the South Karelia Social and Health Care District Eksote. During the 12-month pilot, Posti's employees will help Eksote's home care clients as well as clients using services for the disabled in their daily lives as part of meal or mail delivery. Eksote's aim in combining home care with Posti's services is to improve its clients' ability to function and quality of life at home. \n \n Eksote wants to make the support its clients need for coping at home as easily and flexibly available as possible. Posti's network of professionals reaches both densely and sparsely populated areas every weekday, which helps municipalities to provide support in the client's home. \n \n - All our clients have their individual needs and ways of life, which means that the services must be customizable. Receiving help from Posti's employee for daily tasks to complement home care will mean stronger support networks for our clients. The feedback from our clients has been positive. Many of our clients already know Posti's employees from meal and mail delivery, says Taina Jaako, Director of Care at Eksote. \n \n - Posti's task is to help clients with their daily chores during the visit, to talk to them, and to notify Eksote of any exceptions. Combining home services with Posti's other operations - meal deliveries or mail delivery - is a natural choice. Posti can arrange even short visits cost-effectively, Tiina Tapionlinna, Project Director at Posti says. \n \n Posti helps with daily chores, Eksote provides care \n \n Posti's employees will perform specific, predefined tasks. Depending on the client's needs, these could include warming up meals, assisting in eating, and other forms of support for everyday life. Eksote's employees are responsible for health care and other tasks that require competence in social or health care. \n \n - In the care for the elderly, helping the clients with their everyday chores is a major part of the work of home care providers, and the contract with Posti will give us more resources for this. The aging of the population will increase the need for services provided in homes. For Eksote's clients in services for the disabled, Posti creates added value through an improved sense of security, by having someone visit the clients between the visits by our professionals, Merja Heinonen, Service Manager at Eksote says. \n \n Posti's home services are available for clients selected by Eksote in Yl\u00e4maa, Savitaipale and Rautj\u00e4rvi. Posti has years of experience in cooperation with municipal home care in the form of meal deliveries. \n \n Posti's employees are always near \n \n As digitalization is decreasing the volume of traditional mail, Posti is investing in developing its business in services related to care, security, housekeeping, and property management. Posti's network of professionals and our transport fleet cover the entire country, and they can be used for the benefit of companies, cities and consumer customers in many ways in addition to the delivery of mail and meals. Posti reaches 2.8 million households every weekday. \n \n Posti has launched a trial with Securitas on alarm and security services in Muhos and Ylivieska. The trial will last for this spring. In Oulu, Posti has launched a pilot project, during which Posti's mail deliverers visit the homes of elderly clients. The deliverer meets the elderly client and informs their family member of how the person was feeling that day. In addition, Posti is planning to extend its services to housekeeping and property management. \n \n Posti Group is your first choice in postal, logistics, and e-commerce services. We manage the flow of commerce and everyday life in nine countries. Our net sales in 2014 amounted to EUR 1.859 billion.

The service will be performed in conjunction with mail delivery on Tuesdays and it will be available in one-month packages. The first date the service can be performed is May 17, and the service will be available until the end of August. \n \n Posti has developed new home-delivered services to add more work to mail delivery operations. Traditional mail volumes are falling, but mail routes nevertheless reach some 2.8 households on every weekday. Posti's new home services will see it transform increasingly into a service company. \n \n \"Lawn mowing is the first home service that consumers can order from Posti. We will pilot the service this summer throughout the country. The idea for the lawn mowing service came from mail delivery employees. We believe many customers will be happy to outsource lawn mowing when we make it convenient for them to do so,\" says Anu Punola, Director at Posti. \n \n Orders for lawn mowing services will be taken into account in the planning of mail delivery routes. The service will be offered on Tuesdays due to the lower volume of advertisements and publications distributed on that day. The service will be performed using the customer's lawn mower and within the time estimated by the customer. In the event of rain on the day of intended service delivery, the lawn will be mowed at another time. \n \n \"Posti hopes Finland will see great weather this summer and that our customers enjoy the hottest time of the year. This summer, we invite you to rely on our nationwide network of professionals to help you maintain your lawn,\" Punola adds. \n \n Mail delivery employees are close to customers \n \n The work of mail delivery employees has become increasingly diverse. With extensive experience of meal delivery, Posti currently delivers some two million meals to Finnish homes annually. As part of the development of new home services, Posti is also partnering with the South Karelia Social and Health Care District Eksote in the provision of home care and services for people with disabilities by assisting customers with eating and daily chores. Posti is also partnering with Securitas to perform security services in a pilot being conducted in the Finnish towns of Muhos and Ylivieska. \n \n Lawn mowing service is tax-deductible for domestic costs \n \n Orders for lawn mowing services can be placed via Posti's online shop at posti.fi/ruohonleikkaus. The payment methods accepted by the online shop are online banking and credit cards.

The price will be half of the monthly price. Orders for the lawn mowing service must be placed no later than one week before the start of the next calendar month. Customers will receive an e-mail confirmation of their order and a reminder message on the day before the lawn mowing service is performed. ||||| Image: Posti \n \n Starting in May, Finnish residents will no longer receive garden variety mail services, as the postal delivery company Posti moves to introduce a new grass cutting service. \n \n In a statement released Thursday, Posti said that customers will be able to order the service from next week, although postal workers won\u2019t begin tending lawns until May. \n \n The lawn maintenance service will be available with mail delivery on Tuesdays. The company explained the choice of service time by noting that mail volumes on Tuesday are typically lower than on other days. Customers will be able to order the weekly half-hour trim for a monthly fee of 65 euros. \n \n Posti: Idea came from the ground up \n \n The idea for the grassroots service came from Posti mail carriers, according to director Anu Punola. She pointed out that Posti is in a period of transition caused by falling mail volumes. The firm also field-tested the idea on consumers. \n \n \"We have genuinely tried to find services that would make people\u2019s lives easier,\" she added. \n \n Punola noted that mail carriers can volunteer to tend customers\u2019 lawns and added that supervisors have determined which employees are willing to pitch in. \n \n \"We have been able to find volunteers,\" Punola commented and said other services are in the works. She would not reveal what the company has up its sleeve, but said the ideas must be competitive. \n \n Consumers will be able to purchase the new service for one-month periods and mail carriers will actually begin tackling lawns from May 17. The service will close at the end of August. \n \n Postal workers won\u2019t carry lawnmowers on the job, so customers must have one on hand. In the event of rain, the service will be postponed.",

According to a contract issued by the school in Atmore, Alabama, 17-year-old Chelsey Ramer, of the Poarch Creek Band of Indians, would not receive her diploma or high school transcripts until she paid a $1,000 fine for wearing the feather. \n \n \u201cI feel like this wasn\u2019t fair. It felt like it wasn\u2019t legal,\u201d Ramer said. \u201cIt really did hurt my feelings. I have watched others wear it and I looked forward to it my whole four years there. Now when it was my turn, [they said] I couldn\u2019t.\u201d \n \n Ramer said American Indian seniors four years ago wore feathers to the school\u2019s graduation, but because it was a surprise to the school, no action was taken. \n \n \u201cAbout two months ago, me and the other Indian seniors from the graduating class asked our headmaster if we could wear the feathers on our caps. She told us \u2018no\u2019 and that if we did, she would pull us off the field,\u201d Ramer said. \n \n Ramer says soon after their request, the school gave graduating students a contract that they had to sign or they would not be able to participate in graduation. \n \n \u201cI never signed that paper,\u201d she said. \n \n The contract outlined rules for what to wear at the graduation ceremony. It forbid any \u201cextraneous items during graduation exercises.\u201d It also said students violating the contract would not get their diplomas until appropriate disciplinary actions were taken and students paid a $1,000 fine. \n \n Ramer decided that expressing her Native heritage with an eagle feather was worth the consequences. Of the other three Native seniors at Escambia, one wore a feather on a necklace and did not face any disciplinary actions; the other two did not wear a feather at all for fear of being fined. \n \n While Ramer was nervous on graduation day, she had been looking forward to wearing that eagle feather for four years, so she wore it with pride. \n \n \u201cI got my friend behind me to put it on my tassel, I went down the field. They didn't say anything, but you could tell the staff and the headmaster was upset. But everybody clapped for me,\u201d she said. \n \n Though no one addressed the issue during the ceremony, she was not given a diploma. \u201cI turned in my cap and gown and they just looked at me,\u201d Ramer said. \n \n When Ramer visited the administrative office on May 29 to speak with Headmaster Betty Warren, she was told Warren was no longer with the school. \n \n According to the school\u2019s website, David Walker, the girls\u2019 basketball coach is now serving as the interim headmaster.

And in September, 11 people were killed and 44 hospitalized after a man drove an SUV deliberately into people at a plaza in the central province of Hunan, before jumping out and attacking victims with a dagger and shovel. Other deadly attacks have occurred at schools, including several in 2010 in which nearly 20 children were killed, prompting a response from top government officials and leading many schools to beef up security. However, in June, a man used a kitchen knife to attack three boys and a mother near a school in Shanghai, killing two of the children.",

    "document": "By now you\u2019ve probably read a number of scathing reviews of \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d Universal\u2019s inaugural entry in a possibly grievously ill-advised \u201cDark Universe\u201d franchise, wherein the legendary studio intends to reboot its most Famous Monsters of Filmland. Perhaps I\u2019m becoming jaded in my old age, but I was more amused than appalled. \n \n Don\u2019t get me wrong. \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d directed (if that\u2019s what you want to call it; I honestly think the better term here is \u201costensibly overseen on behalf of the studio executives\u201d) by Alex Kurtzman from a script by David Koepp, Christopher McQuarrie, and Dylan Kussman, has plenty to get irritated about. I got sand in my synapses during an early scene in which Tom Cruise, as a looter named Nick Morton (oh, \u201cMort,\u201d I get it now), and his sidekick, played by Jake Johnson, casually slaughter a bunch of \u201cIraqi insurgents\u201d trying to track down a mysterious treasure. Oh, sure, filmmakers, by all means use a tragic and unnecessary war that\u2019s still yielding horrific consequences for the world as the backdrop for your stupid horror movie plot machinations, no problem here. \n \n Advertisement \n \n And, of course, there\u2019s the movie\u2019s very old-school sexism. \"The Mummy\" has two female characters: One is corrupt albeit not unattractive ancient Egyptian royal Ahmanet, who, once freed from her tomb in the present day, is the incarnation of all evil and stuff. (She is played by Sofia Boutella, whose filmography testifies that she\u2019s accustomed to being ill-used in motion pictures). The other is faux-archeologist/genuine anti-evil secret agent Jenny (Annabelle Wallis) who\u2019s mainly around to be rescued by Nick, and whose surface venality suggests that his business card describes him as a \u201clovable rogue.\u201d \n \n So yes, should one choose to take offense, one certainly may. But I have to be honest\u2014speaking of venality, I found something almost admirable about the film\u2019s cheek. It\u2019s amazingly relentless in its naked borrowing from other, better horror and sci-fi movies that I was able to keep occupied making a checklist of the movies referenced. At its opening, remnants of a past civilization are discovered while workmen are tunneling underground for a new subway route. That\u2019s from \u201cQuatermass and the Pit,\u201d aka \u201cFive Million Miles to Earth.\u201d As many other reviewers have noted, once Jake Johnson\u2019s character buys in and is reborn as a wisecracking undead sidekick warning Nick about how he\u2019s been cursed by incarnation-of-evil Ahmanet, it\u2019s \u201cAmerican Werewolf in London\u201d time, albeit with PG-13-rated special effects rather than the side of ketchup-dipped corned beef that fell from Griffin Dunne\u2019s face in the earlier movie. What else? A woman whose kiss drains the life force out of those who receive it, from the wacky space-vampire movie \u201cLifeforce\u201d? Check. A brain-draining insect in the ear from \u201cStar Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan\u201d? Check. Spavined slapstick undead assaulters out of \u201cEvil Dead\u201d? Check. Underwater fights with the undead out of Lucio Fulci\u2019s \u201cZombie\u201d? Check. (These too are toned down considerably from the source material.) Someone saying \u201cPlans?\u201d with the precise intonation Sir Ralph Richardson used in \u201cTales from the Crypt\u201d? Also check. Don\u2019t even get me started on the, um, appropriation of a famous line from the Universal monster movie \u201cBride of Frankenstein.\u201d But that\u2019s life, and that movie literally IS Universal\u2019s property. \n \n There have been a lot of crocodile tears already shed about the fact that The Mighty Tom Cruise has allowed himself to be used in such dreck, and also that Russell Crowe has been compelled to continue to sink into a form of self-parody by appearing as the head of Jenny\u2019s anti-evil agency, a character named Dr. Henry Jekyll, and yeah, it\u2019s the same guy. Or some iteration of the same guy. As it happens, Dr. Jekyll was never one of the Universal Studios monsters, but the character IS in the public domain, so I guess the corporate overlords of the Dark Universe figured \u201cwhat the you-know-what.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n Anyway, I cannot feel too aggrieved for either star. As Richard Harris and Richard Burton found out for themselves many years before Crowe came along, there comes a time in the career of every loose-cannon macho actor where the any-port-in-a-financial-year-storm approach to career management is all for the best. As for Cruise, he is known for his try-anything-once sense of cinematic adventure, and he does like his franchises. The Morton character is admittedly more of a callow nothingburger than any he\u2019s played. And given how the movie ends I\u2019m a little disappointed that he wasn\u2019t named Larry Talbot. But who knows, maybe he\u2019ll be obliged to change it for the next installment. Which I am looking forward to, out of nothing but base curiosity. ||||| PLOT An explorer disturbs a mummy\u2019s tomb and unleashes an evil force. CAST Tom Cruise, Sofia Boutella, Russell Crowe RATED PG-13 (violence, scary images, suggestive content, partial nudity) LENGTH 1:50 BOTTOM LINE A blaring, bloated zombie of a movie. \n \n What happens when you update Universal Pictures\u2019 classic monster movies, with their old-world charm and Gothic elegance, for a new audience accustomed to the high-tech action and postmodern sarcasm of Disney\u2019s Marvel movies? The answer, in the case of \u201cThe Mummy\u201d \u2014 a big-budget reboot of the 1932 Boris Karloff gem \u2014 is a hideous Frankenstein of a film that seems doomed to repulse anyone who comes across it. \n \n Sorry for the mixed monster metaphor, but this is one massive mess of a movie. The first in a planned series of reboots, in which everyone from the Wolf Man to the Hunchback of Notre Dame will live in a shared Dark Universe, \u201cThe Mummy\u201d sets a tone of thematic confusion and box-office desperation. Written by what seems to be a conflicted three-man team (including David Koepp, of \u201cJurassic Park\u201d) and directed as if in a panic by Alex Kurtzman, \u201cThe Mummy\u201d is an action-horror-fantasy driven entirely by special effects, with incongruous elements of black comedy, eroticism and gadgetry \u2014 all laid atop the narrative blueprint of an \u201cAvengers\u201d movie. \n \n Not even the charisma of Tom Cruise can shine through this film\u2019s CGI-generated murk. Cruise plays Nick Morton, a mercenary tomb raider who discovers the sarcophagus of the cursed Egyptian princess Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella, half-naked and covered in rune tattoos). Once reanimated, she gets the hots for Nick and appears to him in gauzy hallucinations that resemble a perfume commercial. Luckily, Nick\u2019s sort-of girlfriend, Egyptologist Jenny Halsey (an oddly icy Annabelle Wallis), knows who to call: a genial if somewhat unstable doctor whose last name is Jekyll (Russell Crowe). \n \n This may be the movie\u2019s worst conceptual misfire. \u201cThe Mummy\u201d wants to establish Jekyll/Hyde as its own Banner/Hulk, but also as its own Nick Fury, the top commander behind the Marvel heroes. Crowe is surprisingly fun in the role \u2014 he plays Hyde like a steroidal Cockney gangster \u2014 but the character can\u2019t serve triple duty as head honcho, superhero and mad scientist all at once. \n \n Virtually everything in this movie seems like the wrong decision. Why does \u201cThe Mummy\u201d spend so much time in 12th century England? Why is it partly a zombie comedy, in which Nick is pestered by an undead wisenheimer (Jake Johnson)? Why are the one-liners so dopey? It has to be said: This \u201cMummy\u201d makes even the Brendan Fraser versions of the franchise seem like classics. ||||| \n \n Sofia Boutella stars in \u201cThe Mummy.\u201d This monster flick starts in the Middle East but ends up mostly involving chase scenes with the mummy on the loose in England, kissing innocent people to death, then reanimating them. (Universal Pictures) \n \n Given that \u201cSpider-Man\u201d is getting its third reboot since 2002, it\u2019s a small miracle that Universal waited as long as it did to resurrect 1999\u2019s wildly successful sleeper hit \u201cThe Mummy.\u201d In the midst of franchise mania, the studio is launching its very own universe of monster flicks, and the Tom Cruise-led action thriller heralds the start of a world that may include \u201cThe Bride of Frankenstein,\u201d \u201cThe Invisible Man\u201d and \u201cThe Wolfman,\u201d to name a few. \n \n That\u2019s some pressure the movie doesn\u2019t shoulder well, considering it\u2019s hardly the unqualified success of other trial balloons, like \u201cIron Man,\u201d \u201cX-Men\u201d or even \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d In fact, \u201cThe Mummy\u201d might make a viewer wonder whether this universe will even take off at all. \n \n It won\u2019t be for a lack of star power. Cruise plays Nick Morton, a brave, foolish soldier of fortune who, along with his buddy Chris (Jake Johnson), scours the Middle East looking for antiquities to loot and sell on the black market. During one such trek he stumbles upon an Egyptian crypt. But as his recent bedfellow, archaeologist Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis), breathily describes it: \u201cThis is not a tomb \u2014 it\u2019s a prison.\u201d \n \n We already know what that means, thanks to some thoroughly informative voice-over narration by a certain Dr. Jekyll (Russell Crowe), who reveals the identity of the woman buried at this site. The daughter of a pharaoh, Ahmanet (Sofia Boutella) made a pact with Set, the god of death, before murdering her father, his wife and their newborn baby so that she could take the throne. She was caught before she could carry out the prophesy \u2014 using a fancy dagger to kill a man so that Set would have his very own body \u2014 and was mummified and buried alive far from Egypt. \n \n She\u2019d be forever stuck under a pool of mercury if Nick\u2019s reckless gunfire didn\u2019t upend the complex cable-and-pulley system holding her there. She appears to Nick in one of many daydream sequences to say how pleased she is with this turn of events, although once again Jenny is on hand to over\u00adexplain things: \u201cWe\u2019ve angered the gods,\u201d she laments. \n \n \n \n Boutella stars as Ahmanet, a mummy unleashed by treasure hunter Nick Morton (Tom Cruise). (Universal Pictures) \n \n The rest of the movie, directed by Alex Kurtzman, is mostly chase scenes with the mummy on the loose in England, kissing innocent people to death, sucking the life out of them and then reanimating the corpses to create her own zombie army. In fact, \u201cThe Mummy\u201d has more in common with \u201cThe Living Dead\u201d movies than the 1932 horror film or its 1999 remake, although the dead aren\u2019t the only ones working for this villainess. She also has rats and spiders on her payroll, among many other creepy-crawlies designed to make the audience squirm and shudder. \n \n Nick joins forces with Jenny and her boss, Jekyll, who is hammered into the story so that we don\u2019t forget this is the start of a franchise rather than a stand-alone movie that already has plenty going on without yet another plot thread. \n \n \n \n Nick (Cruise) and Jenny Halsey (Annabelle Wallis) in \u201cThe Mummy.\u201d Universal Pictures\u2019 action-horror movie, which seems to be the first in a series of reboots, has star power and a few thrills, but the convoluted story decays before our eyes. (Chiabella James/Universal Pictures) \n \n Some of the action is thrilling, especially a brilliantly choreographed plane crash that has Nick and Jenny tossed around the cabin before he straps her into a parachute and pulls the cord, whisking her out into the sky. The movie also has a few genuinely funny moments. When the mummy ominously runs her long nails over Nick\u2019s torso, he starts giggling; he\u2019s ticklish, apparently. \n \n But the big thrills and few laughs are no match for the cumbersome, convoluted story, not to mention the nonexistent chemistry between Cruise and Wallis. (We\u2019re not going to pin the blame on her considering the way her connection with Cillian Murphy popped off the screen in \u201cPeaky Blinders.\u201d) \n \n The whole thing culminates in an underwater chase scene that\u2019s painfully lugubrious. After the fast-paced thrills of the \u201cFast & Furious\u201d franchise, among other action movies, seeing Cruise breaststroke away from some zombies is bizarre and comical. If something is in fact being launched with \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d it\u2019s not off to a very snappy start. ||||| How meh is The Mummy? Let me count the ways. For all the huffing and puffing and digital desperation from overworked computers, this reboot lands onscreen with a resounding thud. Tom Cruise should have played the Mummy \u2013 that way his face would be swathed in bandages and his fans wouldn't have to see him sweat so hard to get this lumbering loser off the ground. \n \n \n \n Related 2017 Summer Movie Preview: From Superhero Blockbusters to Oscar Hopefuls Webslingers to 'Wonder Woman,' angry apes to angrier aliens and even a few prestige movies \u2013 your complete blockbuster guide \n \n In a gender flip, the title role originated by Boris Karloff in 1932 is played by Algerian actress Sofia Boutella (Kingsman: The Secret Service). She's Ahmanet, an evil Egyptian princess who killed her daddy a few millennia back \u2013 she wanted to be pharaoh instead of her baby brother, see \u2013 and for her trouble got buried alive for several millennia in Mesopotamia, currently known as Iraq. Cruise takes the role of Nick Morton, a hustler in antiquities who unearths the tomb of this \"3000-year-old prune,\" a hellion who wants to use our hero's body to house Set, the god of the dead. \n \n Still with me? Director Alex Kurtzman \u2013 who, as a screenwriter, has tackled everything from Alias episodes to a Transformers movie \u2013 can't seem to make sense of a script by numerous writers clearly unashamed of hack work. Nick, his blond British squeeze Jenny Halsey (Peaky Blinders' Annabelle Wallis) and his wisecracking best-friend-forever Chris Vail (New Girl's Jake Johnson) all end up in modern-day London fighting Ahmanet and her ghouls. How do you win a fight against the undead? My point exactly. \n \n \n \n Meanwhile, Russell Crowe, looking winded and all-too-aware of the schlock he's selling, shows up as mean Dr. Jekyll and his even meaner alter ego Mr. Hyde. No reason, except to set the stage for Universal's coming Dark Universe series of which The Mummy is the first installment. You heard us right. They are already prepping revamps of Jekyll & Hyde, The Invisible Man with Johnny Depp and Bride of Frankenstein, starring Javier Bardem as the monster. This anticipation killer is not going to help. It's a monster fail.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Mummy marks a return to the past and a nod to the future for Universal: Taking inspiration from its 1932 and 1999 films of the same name, it's the first installment of a new \"Dark Universe\" franchise that is set to include flicks like Jekyll & Hyde and Bride of Frankenstein. Tom Cruise stars as an antiquities hunter who disturbs an Egyptian sarcophagus and awakes an evil spirit. Here's what critics are saying: Peter Travers calls The Mummy \"a monster fail\" that kills anticipation for future franchise flicks. It has too much CGI, and director Alex Kurtzman \"can't seem to make sense of a script by numerous writers clearly unashamed of hack work,\" he writes at Rolling Stone. He adds Russell Crowe appears as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde for no good reason. Crowe is \"surprisingly fun\" in this role, but the film's attempts to make him into \"head honcho, superhero, and mad scientist all at once\" may be its \"worst conceptual misfire,\" Rafer Guzman writes at Newsday. But then, \"virtually everything in this movie seems like the wrong decision.\" It's a \"massive mess of a movie\" that \"seems doomed to repulse anyone who comes across it,\" he writes. Glenn Kenny was also thrown off by the Jekyll character, but that's just one reason he's warning that the \"Dark Universe\" franchise might be a \"grievously ill-advised\" one.

    "document": "Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 Donna Mae Litowitz, a Miami Beach retiree, likes Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont so much that three months ago she sent his presidential campaign $10,000. His campaign sent back all but $2,700 because it was more than he was allowed to take under federal election law, but she wishes he had kept it all. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cI like what Sanders stands for, and he says what needs to be said,\u201d said Ms. Litowitz, who gave money in 2008 to Senator Barack Obama\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t like Hillary Clinton.\u201d \n \n In an election dominated by million-dollar donations to \u201csuper PACs,\u201d Ms. Litowitz qualifies in Mr. Sanders\u2019s insurgent campaign as a big donor. Unlike almost all of the other major Democratic and Republican candidates this year, Mr. Sanders has refused to accept support from super PACs, relying instead on supporters like Ms. Litowitz as well as tens of thousands of small donors giving as little as $5 or $10. \n \n The average donation, according to campaign officials, is $31.30. \n \n The result is a campaign built on populist issues like income inequality that appears to be drawing even more rank-and-file support than Mr. Obama did in 2008, when he used a network of smaller donors to win the White House. \n \n About a quarter of Mr. Obama\u2019s donors over the course of that campaign gave a total of $200 or less, according to a study by the Campaign Finance Institute. While direct comparisons are difficult at this early stage in the 2016 race, Mr. Sanders\u2019s small-dollar support appears significantly higher than Mr. Obama\u2019s in 2008, and more than any other candidate this cycle. \n \n Mr. Sanders has raised more money in gifts of $200 or less than any candidate, Democrat or Republican, an analysis of campaign finance reports shows. A huge chunk of his money \u2014 $11.4 million, or about 75 percent of all his contributions \u2014 has come from small donations routed through ActBlue, an online site that facilitates contributions to Democrats, records show. \n \n The influx of support has helped Mr. Sanders build a formidable war chest, with his campaign raising $15.2 million as of the most recent filings with the Federal Election Commission in July. Campaign officials say he has raised millions more since then and will far surpass that total this quarter. That still puts him far behind Mrs. Clinton\u2019s fund-raising juggernaut, but Mr. Sanders said in an interview that he was unbowed. \n \n \u201cWe will be greatly outspent, yes, but we will raise enough money to wage a winning campaign,\u201d he said. \n \n Democratic strategists are beginning to take notice. \n \n \u201cHis money is very impressive,\u201d said Bill Burton, a former aide to Mr. Obama who helped found Priorities USA, a super PAC that is now supporting Mrs. Clinton\u2019s bid for the Democratic nomination and has received donations of at least $1 million each from a number of big Democratic donors like Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, George Soros and Haim Saban. \n \n But Mr. Sanders\u2019s fund-raising strategy will test the prevailing notion in Washington that no candidate can successfully compete on the national stage without tapping into the many millions of dollars that have poured into super PACs since the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United decision in 2010. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Super PACs supporting Mrs. Clinton have already raised more than $20 million, records show; on the Republican side, two super PACs backing Jeb Bush raised about $108.5 million. \n \n Yet when a Vermont legislator, Chris Pearson, offered to set up a super PAC to support the Sanders campaign, Mr. Sanders told him to \u201ckill it,\u201d Mr. Sanders said, because did not want to be beholden to \u201cthe millionaires and billionaires.\u201d \n \n Continue reading the main story First Draft Newsletter Subscribe for updates on the 2016 presidential race, the White House and Congress, delivered to your inbox Monday - Friday. \n \n Mr. Sanders said that it was \u201ca difficult decision\u201d to opt out of such a powerful and quick way to raise money. In doing so, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re giving up millions and millions of dollars, no doubt, but we will sink or swim based on what we get from the middle class of the country.\u201d \n \n Nor has Mr. Sanders held many of the kind of fund-raisers that presidential candidates traditionally devote much of their time to. He has held only five, and they have been more like political rallies, held at places like a Washington, D.C., brewery and a Seattle tavern, with a contribution of $100 or less sometimes required. \n \n Jeff Weaver, the campaign manager for Mr. Sanders, said in an interview that \u201cit\u2019s absolutely possible to win without the super PACs.\u201d \n \n Mr. Weaver said that the campaign had been able to leverage the big turnouts seen at rallies \u2014 he estimated the combined crowds at three recent West Coast events at 70,000 \u2014 by following up by phone or email seeking donations. \n \n \u201cThe fund-raising from our standpoint is going phenomenally,\u201d Mr. Weaver said. \u201cWe\u2019re way ahead of where we thought we would be.\u201d \n \n Even so, Mr. Sanders in the last quarter raised less than a third as much as Mrs. Clinton, whose campaign reported contributions of $47.5 million in the spring quarter. \n \n But Mr. Sanders and his aides say they can blunt the effect of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s financial advantage by running a more frugal campaign, even as they build campaign operations in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. \n \n So far, the more-with-less approach is holding up. \n \n In his filings to the election commission, Mr. Sanders reported spending only about $3 million \u2014 or less than 20 percent of the money he had raised. Mrs. Clinton, in comparison, reported spending at about twice that rate, or about $18.7 million \u2014 nearly 39 percent of her contributions \u2014 on things like catering at fund-raisers and slick media productions. (Her campaign asked for approval from the election commission this month to allow donors to pay for their own food, drinks and valet parking at some events.) \n \n Mr. Sanders was left with $12.1 million in cash on hand at the end of June, and Mrs. Clinton had $28.9 million. \n \n \u201cWhen you know you\u2019re not going to raise as much as your opponent, you have to make every dollar count,\u201d Mr. Weaver said. ||||| David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and self-described \"racial realist,\" says Donald Trump is the best Republican candidate for president because he \"understands the real sentiment of America.\" \n \n Duke, who unsuccessfully ran for president as a Democrat in 1988 and later served in the Louisiana House of Representatives, noted Trump's experience as a salesman and his \"great sense\" of what people want to buy. \n \n \"I praise the fact that he's come out on the immigration issue. I'm beginning to get the idea that he's a good salesman. That he's an entrepreneur and he has a good sense of what people want to hear what they want to buy,\" said Duke on his radio program last week after noting that he had previously been critical of Trump's run. \n \n \"And I think he realizes that his path to popularity toward power in the Republican Party is talking about the immigration issue. And he has really said some incredibly great things recently. So whatever his motivation, I don't give a damn. I really like the fact that he's speaking out on this greatest immediate threat to the American people.\" \n \n Later in his show, Duke said his view on Trump was evolving. \n \n \"I've said from the beginning I think his campaign is good in the sense that it's bringing these issues to a discussion which we have to have in America. And he's continuing to move the envelope further and I think he understands the real sentiment of America.\" \n \n Duke, who said he wasn't sure if Trump's proposals are sincere or are just a means to getting the nomination, spoke favorably of Trump's policy calling for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants, saying it was the government's role. \n \n After going on a rant about \"Jewish domination\" of the media, Duke said Trump is saying things few other Republicans say about immigration \n \n \"Trump, he's really going all out. He's saying what no other Republicans have said, few conservatives say. And he's also gone to point where he says it's not just illegal immigration, it's legal immigration,\" Duke said, adding Trump has also talked about companies are taking advantage of the H1B visa program. Duke added that he felt the big technology companies were headed by \"Zios.\" \n \n Duke said The Donald, while untrustworthy, was \"the best of the lot\" running. \n \n \"So this is a great opportunity,\" Duke said. \"So although we can't trust him to do what he says, the other Republican candidates won't even say what he says.

I personally am not a fan. I don't think she does a good job. I don't think she's a very good professional. I think frankly the show's better without her, but that's up to them and they can do whatever they want. I respect [Fox News chief] Roger Ailes, he can do whatever he wants. I don't care.\" ||||| The Joe Biden who has been reaching out to Democratic operatives and would-be donors for a potential 2016 bid isn\u2019t quite the happy warrior of bygone days. \n \n Mourning the loss of his eldest son Beau, who succumbed to a brain tumor three months ago, and under intense pressure from the presidential hype he\u2019s helped stoke, Biden is more subdued, grayer and grimly on-task than usual \u2014 this while occupying political center stage for the first time since the promising opening days of his doomed 1988 campaign. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n For all the breathless reporting on Biden\u2019s every move and meeting, he is, at core, a 72-year-old man presented with an unexpected, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity at one of the worst times of his life. \n \n Several people Biden has talked to in the past month say he starts off conversations by conceding that \u201csome days are better than others,\u201d mixing recollections of Beau with logistical questions about mounting a state-by-state challenge to a vulnerable yet still formidable Hillary Clinton. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s just not himself,\u201d says a longtime friend of Biden\u2019s. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of all over the place. He\u2019s engaged but not in that childlike, manic way he usually is. He\u2019s taking it all in and soaking up information, but he\u2019s hard to read. And Joe Biden isn\u2019t usually that hard to read.\u201d \n \n That isn\u2019t to say Biden won\u2019t decide to run \u2014 he clearly sees Clinton\u2019s struggles with her email scandal as an opportunity, and no politician in recent history has proven to be as resilient in the face of personal tragedy. \n \n To the annoyance of the Clinton campaign, Biden\u2019s allies have strategically leaked his modest, noncommittal doings to the media, which have given otherwise ho-hum confabs with Elizabeth Warren and President Barack Obama\u2019s former counsel Bob Bauer bombshell treatment. (Warren, according to a person with knowledge of the interaction, offered her usual warning against bringing more Wall Street executives into the White House; the talk with Bauer, an old Biden friend who worked with him closely in the White House, was intended to be an informal, personal check-in session that was leaked against the wishes of the participants.) \n \n But reports that the vice president has all but made up his mind to run are simply not true, according to a half-dozen people in his inner circle interviewed by POLITICO. \u201cHe\u2019s not leaning one way or the other,\u201d says one former aide who remains part of the extended Biden political family. \n \n What he has done is accelerated the pace of his deliberations, making personal overtures to Democratic donors \u2014 though Clinton\u2019s team has yet to suffer any significant defections. So far he\u2019s attracted a handful of former Obama supporters who have gravitated to a \u201cDraft Biden\u201d startup, including veteran Florida operative Steve Schale and Jon Cooper, a Long Island businessman who was one of Obama\u2019s top New York fundraisers. \n \n But he\u2019s behaved more like a staffer than a principal \u2014 sounding out potential supporters without striding into the race with a distinct message or specific policy challenge to Clinton. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do,\u201d said Jim Kreindler, a 2008 Biden fundraiser who is encouraging the vice president to run. \u201cEverybody knows it\u2019s going to be hard to challenge Hillary for money. \u2026 But I think he knows that he needs to be positioned to jump in if she really stumbles.\u201d \n \n As he embarks on a fact-finding project most other candidates completed months ago, Biden\u2019s greatest concern remains his family. He\u2019s especially worried about his wife, Jill, who was hit hard by the death of 46-year-old Beau, who she raised after Biden\u2019s first wife and infant daughter were killed in a car crash in 1972. \n \n Beau urged his father to run for years, but Jill is deeply skeptical of another run, according to people close to Biden; she re-upped to teach a full-time load of five English classes at Northern Virginia Community College next semester, as first noted by Bloomberg News, not exactly the action of a woman who planned to hit the campaign trail. \n \n Joe Biden wants to run \u2014 he always has. But that doesn\u2019t mean he actually will, and those who have spoken with him say he seems far from making a decision. He\u2019s playing the same wait-and-see game he\u2019s played for the past 18 months, telling potential backers he\u2019ll make a decision as late as early October. Since his 2012 reelection, Biden had opted for inaction over action \u2014 he opted not to create a leadership PAC for the 2014 midterms, he balked at forming a presidential super PAC, he didn\u2019t seriously sound out donors until this summer. \n \n On the other hand, his numbers are too good to ignore. Without even being in the race, he consistently polls in double digits \u2014 and narrowly bested Clinton in head-to-head matchups against top Republicans in the key swing states of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. Moreover, he\u2019s regarded as much more trustworthy than the former secretary of state, enjoying a 20-point lead over Clinton in that metric among battleground state voters. \n \n Obama, according to current and former West Wing officials, is more inclined to support Clinton\u2019s candidacy. Despite her woes, he sees her as a more electable candidate and a more effective keeper of his policy legacy. He\u2019s done everything but endorse her already, putting his vast fundraising network in the hands of Clinton\u2019s super PAC allies. Two of Obama\u2019s top White House aides, John Podesta and Jennifer Palmieri, are running Clinton\u2019s campaign and report regularly to their old West Wing friends \u2014 including the president. \n \n But Obama has told people around him to give the vice president \u201cspace\u201d to make his decision, and urged his staff not to make Biden feel pressured not to run. \n \n White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday that the president wouldn\u2019t rule out making an endorsement in the primaries \u2014 and other West Wing officials told POLITICO that Obama has privately expressed a preference for Clinton as his successor, while keeping up the pretense of being undecided in public. (\u201cI love \u2019em both,\u201d Obama said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show in February when asked who he would back.) \n \n Clinton\u2019s camp, hands full with the email controversy and a surprisingly stout challenge from independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, isn\u2019t in a patient mood. Bill Clinton, according to a person who has spoken with the former president in the past couple of weeks, is \u201cvery agitated\u201d by the possibility of a Biden candidacy and incensed at the press hype around a possible bid. \n \n Hillary Clinton, Democrats in her orbit tell POLITICO, is less concerned \u2014 and several top Clinton campaign officials have told associates they think a Biden bid would energize what has been a fairly lackluster performance by the candidate thus far. \n \n Either way, the Clinton campaign is monitoring Biden\u2019s activities closely \u2014 and Biden\u2019s small team is acutely sensitive to slights against him, and to the possibility that her operation \u2014 including Correct the Record and other Clinton-friendly outside groups \u2014 would push anti-Biden opposition research to reporters in order to dissuade the vice president from running. \u201cThey better not do that,\u201d said a Biden confidant. \u201cThat would bring really out his Irish.\u201d \n \n People close to Clinton say their boss wouldn\u2019t let them push negative information on Biden even if they wanted to \u2014 and it would backfire anyway, considering Biden\u2019s tragic family circumstances. \n \n Biden\u2019s decision will ultimately come down to convincing his family that embarking on one last long-shot campaign is worth the emotional toll, those close to him say. His staff, small as it is, already seems to be on board: Chief of staff Steve Ricchetti, a onetime Clinton aide, has arranged many of Biden\u2019s recent meetings, and longtime staffer Mike Donilon \u2014 who was close to Beau \u2014 has been the most enthusiastic proponent of a 2016 bid, according to Democrats with knowledge of the situation. \n \n Hunter Biden, the vice president\u2019s surviving son, is said to be generally supportive of his father\u2019s wishes, whatever they might be, but not a cheerleader \u2014 Biden\u2019s sister Val, long his closest political adviser, is equally ambivalent. Jill Biden will be a hard sell. \n \n Many of Joe Biden\u2019s friends and family \u2014 people who deeply love the man, even if they don\u2019t share his unquenchable presidential ambitions \u2014 quietly hoped the vice president would never be forced to decide whether or not to run in 2016. \n \n Beau Biden had been expected to survive into the fall, according to several people in the vice president\u2019s orbit. Friends who wanted Biden to bow out gracefully prayed the ailing son would rally \u2014 and hoped his devoted father would be so focused on his recovery he wouldn\u2019t have time to contemplate a campaign until it was too late. \n \n But as has happened so often in Biden\u2019s four decades in the public eye, fate intervened, cruelly. \n \n Experimental treatments to slow the cancer failed, and the former National Guard major and Iraq War veteran \u2014 so upright he refused to wear his uniform in political ads \u2014 faded quickly. That left his grieving father, who could use Beau\u2019s steadfast support now more than ever, alone to confront one of the most wrenching political decisions of his life. \n \n \u201cWe do not know how long we\u2019ve got here. We don\u2019t know when fate will intervene,\u201d Obama said at Beau Biden\u2019s funeral \u2014 words that seem to apply to father as well as son. \u201cWe cannot discern God\u2019s plan. What we do know is that with every minute that we\u2019ve got, we can live our lives in a way that takes nothing for granted.\u201d \n \n Annie Karni contributed to this report. ||||| Single-Click Donating \n \n Meet ActBlue Express Lane \n \n 5,869,981 Democratic donors have saved their payment information with us via an ActBlue Express account. \n \n The best part?

Rick Santorum speaks at the National Press Club in Washington. The two returning Republican presidential... (Associated Press) \n \n In this photo taken Aug. 22, 2015, Republican presidential candidate, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry speaks in Columbus, Ohio. The two returning Republican presidential candidates are struggling to keep... (Associated Press) \n \n A majority of the 2012 donors to former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum who've given this time have defected to other candidates, according to an analysis by Crowdpac.com, a nonpartisan political research company. \n \n The donor disloyalty is contributing to financial woes in both of their campaigns. Perry stopped paying most of his staffers, and much of Santorum's top staff left to start a super PAC, which is free of contribution limits. \n \n As the only two members of a 17-person presidential field who competed in 2012, Perry and Santorum should have among the strongest, most up-to-date fundraising bases. Santorum won 11 primary states, lasting until April 2012 when Mitt Romney secured the nomination. Perry bowed out in January but was a strong early fundraiser. \n \n But four years later, many of their donors have eyes for others: Perry counted 470 return supporters, while 557 went with other candidates. For Santorum, 257 of his past presidential contributors gave to him again, while 414 put their money elsewhere, the data show. \n \n For its donor loyalty assessment, Crowdpac reviewed Federal Election Commission data on contributors to the 2012 and 2016 presidential campaigns. The data included only named donors, typically those who give at least $200 per election cycle. The figures are current through the end of June. \n \n For both Perry and Santorum, the most popular 2016 alternative is Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who welcomed 380 of their previous contributors. One oddity: two 2012 Perry donors decided to support Santorum this time. \n \n Perry's campaign raised just over $1 million and Santorum about $600,000 in the first month of their campaigns. By comparison, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush raised $11.4 million in the initial two weeks of his campaign, and Cruz raised $4.3 million in his opening week. \n \n __ \n \n Follow Julie Bykowicz on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/bykowicz ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 No modern candidate can run a legit campaign without help from a super PAC with deep pockets, yes? The New York Times reports that Bernie Sanders is providing a real test of that accepted wisdom. He's managed to build a \"formidable\" sum of $15.2 million while eschewing super PACs, with the average donation to his campaign at $31.30. The vast majority of that total comes from small donations routed through the ActBlue website, which handles donations for Democrats. Sanders knows he will still be widely outspent, but thinks he'll have plenty of money to run a smart, frugal, and \"winning\" campaign.

It boasts a market capitalization of $330 billion, making it worth more than America's most valuable bank: JPMorgan Chase (JPM). \n \n Here's a round-up of the world's 10 most valuable brands: \n \n 1. Google \n \n Google (GOOGL, Tech30) is still the most valuable brand in the world; a title it has retained for seven out of the past 11 years. \n \n Its brand value -- worth just over $245 billion -- increased by 7% from 2016. \n \n The company has transformed itself from a simple search engine to an all-encompassing lifestyle brand, said Doreen Wang, Global Head of BrandZ. \n \n Google's brand is associated with innovative research, self-driving cars and helpful online services like Google Drive, Google Docs and Google Maps. \n \n Bonus: The company consistently ranks as one of the world's best employers. \n \n 2. Apple \n \n Apple's (AAPL, Tech30) brand value nudged up by 3% to $235 billion, helping it retain the No. 2 position in the ranking. But the brand has lost some shine since 2015 when it topped the BrandZ ranking. \n \n Wang said Apple's \"innovation speed over the last year is not perceived to be as fast as Google or Amazon.\" \n \n BrandZ's ranking relies heavily on consumer perceptions. If people can't see that Apple is being innovative, its brand value will suffer. \n \n 3. Microsoft \n \n Microsoft (MSFT, Tech30) has landed in the third slot for three years running. Its brand valuation nudged up by 5% to $143 billion. \n \n \"The key word is Microsoft Cloud,\" said Wang, who said the success of the company's cloud and business services helped improve consumer perceptions. \n \n Microsoft generates nearly a third of its revenue and almost 40% of its operating profits from its \"Intelligent Cloud\" line of businesses. \n \n Investors are clearly happy with the company: Shares have shot up by about 16% since the start of the year. \n \n 4. Amazon \n \n Amazon (AMZN, Tech30) has been on fire over the past year and its brand value surged by 41% to hit $139 billion. \n \n \"Wherever the consumers go, Amazon is going,\" said Wang. \"At this moment, that is the right strategy.\" \n \n The retail giant offers a wide range of services: online shopping, grocery delivery, cloud computing and entertainment are just the tip of the iceberg. It's continuing to develop artificial intelligence services and its personal digital assistant, Alexa. \n \n Investors have taken notice too, bidding up shares by 34% since the start of the year. \n \n 5. Facebook \n \n The Facebook (FB, Tech30) brand continues to perform well, despite scandals over fake news and violent events streamed live on its platform. \n \n Users think of Facebook as \"friendly\" and \"helpful,\" said Wang. This has helped convince advertisers to move onto the platform, and users don't seem to mind the growth in advertised content, she said. \n \n Facebook's brand value shot up by 27% over the past year to hit $130 billion. \n \n 6. AT&T \n \n Telecom giant AT&T (T, Tech30) has appeared in the ranking for seven consecutive years and its brand has increased in value by 65% over that period. It's now worth $115 billion. \n \n \"It's becoming a more dynamic brand and increasing communications with consumers,\" said Wang. \n \n The company is trying to close an acquisition of CNN's parent company, Time Warner (TWX), that is worth about $109 billion including debt. If the purchase goes ahead, it would be one of the biggest takeovers of all time. \n \n 7. Visa \n \n Visa (V) is an American company with a name that's recognized around the world. \n \n The company's brand value increased 10% to hit $111 billion this year. \n \n The brand got a particularly big boost after Costco (COST) ended its relationship with American Express (AXP) last year in favor of a new one with Visa and Citigroup (C). \n \n Millions of former Costco AmEx cards were subsequently transferred to Visa and Citi. \n \n 8. Tencent \n \n Led by its media-shy CEO, \"Pony\" Ma Huateng, Tencent (TCEHY) is huge in China, where its messaging platform WeChat is used for everything from texting to booking karaoke sessions. \n \n BrandZ said that increased used of WeChat helped to propel Tencent into the top 10 for the first time. Its brand value jumped 27% to $108 billion. \n \n The only other Chinese firm to have cracked the top 10 is China Mobile, but it hasn't appeared on the list since 2013. \n \n Tencent is hoping to avoid that same fate by expanding globally. It announced plans last month to set up an artificial intelligence research lab in Seattle. \n \n \"Right now they're very aggressive in going beyond China,\" said Wang. \n \n 9. IBM \n \n IBM (IBM, Tech30) has been included in the ranking since it started in 2006. \n \n This year the brand has been valued at $102 billion, up 18% from last year. \n \n The company has helped boost its consumer appeal through the development of the artificial intelligence mascot Watson. \n \n \"Watson is the face of the company's transformation,\" said Wang. \n \n 10. McDonald's \n \n McDonald's (MCD) is the only truly non-tech company to be featured in the top 10 ranking this year. \n \n The brand has received a boost by introducing more healthy food options. It's also offering more locally-inspired options in places like China and India, said Wang. \n \n \"McDonald's has been doing pretty well compared to the other fast food restaurants,\" she said.",

She was 95. \n \n \"I can confirm the sad news that Joan Lee passed away this morning quietly and surrounded by her family,\" a spokesperson for Stan Lee and his family said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. \"The family ask that you please give them time to grieve and respect their privacy during this difficult time.\" \n \n Joan Lee suffered a stroke earlier in the week and was hospitalized, according to sources. \n \n The British former hat model and Lee were married on Dec. 5, 1947, and were by all accounts hopelessly devoted to each other. They had two children: J.C. (Joan Celia), who was born in 1950, and Jan, who died three days after her birth in 1953. \n \n Marvel paid tribute to her in a statement on Thursday: \"We are so saddened to hear about the loss of Joan Lee. We lost a member of the Marvel family today and our thoughts and prayers go out to Stan and his daughter Joan in this difficult time.\" \n \n Last year, Lee recounted how he met his wife in a story for THR that celebrated his 75th anniversary in comics. After a childhood sweetheart wed another woman, Joan Clayton impulsively married an American soldier during World War II and moved to New York, where she was extremely unhappy. Meanwhile, a cousin of Lee's wanted to set up the struggling writer with a hat model. Lee tells what happened next: \n \n \"When I was young, there was one girl I drew; one body and face and hair. It was my idea of what a girl should be. The perfect woman. And when I got out of the Army, somebody, a cousin of mine, knew a model, a hat model at a place called Laden Hats. He said, 'Stan, there's this really pretty girl named Betty. I think you'd like her. She might like you. Why don't you go over and ask her to lunch.' Blah, blah, blah. \n \n \"So I went up to this place. Betty didn't answer the door. But Joan answered, and she was the head model. I took one look at her \u2014 and she was the girl I had been drawing all my life. And then I heard the English accent. And I'm a nut for English accents! She said, 'May I help you?' And I took a look at her, and I think I said something crazy like, 'I love you.' I don't remember exactly. But anyway, I took her to lunch. I never met Betty, the other girl. I think I proposed to [Joan] at lunch.\" \n \n In those days, the quickest way to get divorced was to move to Nevada and stay for six weeks to establish residency. Soon after Joan arrived in Reno, Stan received a letter from her addressed to \"Jack,\" and that worried him. \n \n \"Now I'm not the smartest guy in world,\" recalled Lee. \"I know my name isn't 'Jack.' And so why did she write 'Dear Jack'? Maybe I better go to Reno and see what's going on. I got there and she was waiting for me. And there's three guys with her. They all look like John Wayne. Big Western guys! Rugged! And I get off the plane fresh from New York with my little porkpie hat and a little scarf and my gloves. And she's with me. I thought, 'I don't have a chance.' Luckily, I had a chance.\" \n \n A judge granted Joan her divorce and about an hour later that judge married her and Lee in a room next door. \n \n The couple returned to New York, where Lee worked at Marvel Comics forerunner Timely/Atlas Comics, a job he initially landed because his cousin Martin Goodman owned the company. Comics were a middling enterprise until Lee and Jack Kirby co-created the Fantastic Four in 1961 (followed by the Hulk, Avengers, Iron Man, X-Men and other characters) and turned the company, renamed Marvel Comics, into a pop culture powerhouse. \n \n In some versions of the origin of the Fantastic Four, Lee credits Joan with inspiring him. He was depressed about his career (Lee had dreams of becoming a serious novelist) and the state of comics (the industry in the 1950s was dominated by stories of war, science fiction and romance, genres he didn't like) and contemplated leaving the business. \n \n \"Before you quit,\" Joan told him, \"why don't you write one comic you are proud of?\" And thus was born the Fantastic Four. \n \n In 1981, the Lees moved from New York City to California so Stan could work on developing Marvel TV and film projects. Joan did voice work on two 1990s animated Marvel shows, Fantastic Four (as Miss Forbes) and Spider-Man (as Madame Web). She also made a cameo in 2016's X-Men: Apocalypse. \n \n Joan Lee also wrote a 1987 novel, The Pleasure Palace, about a man striving to build the most luxurious ocean liner ever while romancing several women at once. According to her daughter, she had three more unpublished but finished novels at home. \n \n On Friday, Stan's Twitter account shared a cartoon of the husband and wife together, swinging off into the sunset. \n \n On behalf of Stan, thanks for the heartfelt condolences.He is well and truly appreciates the outpouring of love for Joan.-POW!

(Associated Press) \n \n The monumental chestnut tree that cheered Anne Frank while she was in hiding from the Nazis was toppled by wind and heavy rain on Monday. \n \n The once mighty tree, now diseased and rotted through the trunk, snapped about 3 feet (1 meter) above ground and crashed across several gardens. It damaged a brick wall and several sheds, but nearby buildings _ including the Anne Frank House museum _ escaped unscathed. No one was injured, a museum spokeswoman said. \n \n \"Someone yelled, 'It's falling. The tree is falling,' and then you heard it go down,\" said museum spokeswoman Maatje Mostart. \"Luckily no one was hurt.\" \n \n A global campaign to save the chestnut, widely known as The Anne Frank Tree, was launched in 2007 after city officials deemed it a safety hazard and ordered it felled. The tree was granted a last-minute reprieve after a battle in court. \n \n The 150-year-old tree suffered from fungus and moths that had caused more than half its trunk to rot. \n \n Two years ago city workmen encased the trunk in a steel support system to prevent it from falling, but that failed under windy weather Monday. \n \n The Netherlands' Trees Institute, one of the most prominent supporters of the preservation project, said it was \"unpleasantly surprised\" by the news of the tree's fall early Monday afternoon. \n \n \"On the advice of experts in tree care, it had been calculated that the tree could live several more decades\" with the support structure, the institute said in a statement. \n \n \"Alas, in the event it seems that nature is stronger.\" \n \n The institute said it didn't know why the support structure had failed. \n \n Many clones of the tree have been taken, including 11 planted at sites around the United States and 150 at a park in Amsterdam. It is not clear whether a new tree will replace the original one on the same spot, since it rests on property belonging to a neighbor. \n \n The Jewish teenager made several references to the tree in the diary that she kept during the 25 months she remained indoors until her family was arrested in August 1944. \n \n \"Nearly every morning I go to the attic to blow the stuffy air out of my lungs,\" she wrote on Feb. 23, 1944. \"From my favorite spot on the floor I look up at the blue sky and the bare chestnut tree, on whose branches little raindrops shine, appearing like silver, and at the seagulls and other birds as they glide on the wind.\" \n \n She also wrote: \"As long as this exists, ... and I may live to see it, this sunshine, the cloudless skies _ while this lasts I cannot be unhappy.\" \n \n Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in March 1945. Her diary was recovered and published after her death. It has become the most widely read document to emerge from the Holocaust.",

These results don\u2019t reflect Google\u2019s own opinions or beliefs \u2013 as a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures. \n \n \u201cAutocomplete predictions are algorithmically generated based on users\u2019 search activity and interests.

Who did that? And how did they decide? Who\u2019s in charge of these decisions? And what will they do in the future? This is clearly just being done in response to a story in the media, but it\u2019s not accountable, and it\u2019s not sustainable.

While Facebook has faced criticism in the wake of revelations about how the site had become a conduit for fake news, the problem facing Google is potentially even more intractable. \n \n O\u2019Neil said that she believed Google would ultimately have to hire human editors. She said: \u201cThere\u2019s a a growing list of social media empires that have been attempting with all their power and might to claim that they don\u2019t have editorial responsibility, but they have been proven wrong. \n \n \u201cThey have been proven wrong by this troll army, and quite clearly when it comes to the questions that require a subtle understanding of the truth versus lies, they are going to have to use human judgment. \n \n \u201cIt is clearly very frightening what is going on here. Google has done a huge amount of work to avoid exactly this scenario. And yet the troll army has still managed to break through all its resources and defences. It is very troubling and they are clearly very, very good at this, but it\u2019s why Google has to own this problem. It is doing a terrible job here. \n \n \u201cTwenty years ago, these sites with these views \u2026 they would have been completely shut out by the mainstream press, but we have replaced our guardians of information with algorithms that are dumb and that can be toyed with and manipulated.\u201d \n \n Jonathan Albright, assistant professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, said that rightwing websites had launched a new \u201cinformation war\u201d, and that that they were winning. His research has shown that fake news and extremist sites have created a vast network of links to each other and mainstream sites that has enabled them to game Google\u2019s algorithm. The top eight out of 10 results for the Google search \u201cwas Hitler bad?\u201d, for example, are links to Holocaust denial sites including the neo-Nazi site, StormFront.org. \n \n Albright\u2019s research has shown that fake news and information is a far bigger structural problem than had been previously realised. He has mapped a \u201cvast satellite system that is encroaching on the mainstream news system\u201d. Websites propagating extreme rightwing propaganda have thrown out thousands of hyperlinks that connect to each other and to mainstream news sources, such as YouTube and Facebook, and he says they \u201care growing in strength and influence every day\u201d. \n \n Julia Powles, a researcher at Cambridge University on technology and law, said Google\u2019s response to the problem was \u201cthe classic PR response\u201d. She added: \u201cThe media makes a fuss about something. Google goes in and hand-tweaks the result, while still claiming that it is not an editor and it is totally neutral, when clearly that is not true. It can and does change search results when it suits them. \n \n Google, democracy and the truth about internet search Read more \n \n \u201cThey keep using this analogy that they\u2019re like a card catalogue, but they\u2019re really more like a card shark that can be gamed. It raises deeply disturbing issues about the democratic distribution of information.\u201d \n \n A Google spokesperson said: \u201cWe took action within hours of being notified on Friday of the autocomplete results.\u201d Google did not comment on its decision to alter some but not all those results raised in the article. \n \n \n \n It said: \u201cOur search results are a reflection of the content across the web. This means that sometimes, unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject-matter online can affect what search results appear for a given query. These results don\u2019t reflect Google\u2019s own opinions or beliefs. As a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures.\u201d \n \n \n \n Danny Sullivan, the editor of Search Engine Land and one of the leading authorities on Google search, said Google faced a \u201cvery difficult, very challenging issue\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019ve done the PR of getting rid of some of the bad stuff quickly, and they will hope the PR spin will help this go away, but it doesn\u2019t take away from the bigger issues. I take the concern very deeply. Google is the universal resource that people turn to. It is a concern they really need to solve.\u201d ||||| Tech-savvy rightwingers have been able to \u2018game\u2019 the algorithms of internet giants and create a new reality where Hitler is a good guy, Jews are evil and\u2026 Donald Trump becomes president \n \n Here\u2019s what you don\u2019t want to do late on a Sunday night. You do not want to type seven letters into Google. That\u2019s all I did. I typed: \u201ca-r-e\u201d. And then \u201cj-e-w-s\u201d. Since 2008, Google has attempted to predict what question you might be asking and offers you a choice. And this is what it did. It offered me a choice of potential questions it thought I might want to ask: \u201care jews a race?\u201d, \u201care jews white?\u201d, \u201care jews christians?\u201d, and finally, \u201care jews evil?\u201d \n \n Are Jews evil? It\u2019s not a question I\u2019ve ever thought of asking. I hadn\u2019t gone looking for it. But there it was. I press enter. A page of results appears. This was Google\u2019s question. And this was Google\u2019s answer: Jews are evil. Because there, on my screen, was the proof: an entire page of results, nine out of 10 of which \u201cconfirm\u201d this. The top result, from a site called Listovative, has the headline: \u201cTop 10 Major Reasons Why People Hate Jews.\u201d I click on it: \u201cJews today have taken over marketing, militia, medicinal, technological, media, industrial, cinema challenges etc and continue to face the worlds [sic] envy through unexplained success stories given their inglorious past and vermin like repression all over Europe.\u201d \n \n Google is search. It\u2019s the verb, to Google. It\u2019s what we all do, all the time, whenever we want to know anything. We Google it. The site handles at least 63,000 searches a second, 5.5bn a day. Its mission as a company, the one-line overview that has informed the company since its foundation and is still the banner headline on its corporate website today, is to \u201corganise the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful\u201d. It strives to give you the best, most relevant results. And in this instance the third-best, most relevant result to the search query \u201care Jews\u2026 \u201d is a link to an article from stormfront.org, a neo-Nazi website. The fifth is a YouTube video: \u201cWhy the Jews are Evil. Why we are against them.\u201d \n \n The sixth is from Yahoo Answers: \u201cWhy are Jews so evil?\u201d The seventh result is: \u201cJews are demonic souls from a different world.\u201d And the 10th is from jesus-is-saviour.com: \u201cJudaism is Satanic!\u201d \n \n There\u2019s one result in the 10 that offers a different point of view. It\u2019s a link to a rather dense, scholarly book review from thetabletmag.com, a Jewish magazine, with the unfortunately misleading headline: \u201cWhy Literally Everybody In the World Hates Jews.\u201d \n \n I feel like I\u2019ve fallen down a wormhole, entered some parallel universe where black is white, and good is bad. Though later, I think that perhaps what I\u2019ve actually done is scraped the topsoil off the surface of 2016 and found one of the underground springs that has been quietly nurturing it. It\u2019s been there all the time, of course. Just a few keystrokes away\u2026 on our laptops, our tablets, our phones. This isn\u2019t a secret Nazi cell lurking in the shadows. It\u2019s hiding in plain sight. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Are women\u2026 Google\u2019s search results. \n \n Stories about fake news on Facebook have dominated certain sections of the press for weeks following the American presidential election, but arguably this is even more powerful, more insidious. Frank Pasquale, professor of law at the University of Maryland, and one of the leading academic figures calling for tech companies to be more open and transparent, calls the results \u201cvery profound, very troubling\u201d. \n \n He came across a similar instance in 2006 when, \u201cIf you typed \u2018Jew\u2019 in Google, the first result was jewwatch.org. It was \u2018look out for these awful Jews who are ruining your life\u2019. And the Anti-Defamation League went after them and so they put an asterisk next to it which said: \u2018These search results may be disturbing but this is an automated process.\u2019 But what you\u2019re showing \u2013 and I\u2019m very glad you are documenting it and screenshotting it \u2013 is that despite the fact they have vastly researched this problem, it has gotten vastly worse.\u201d \n \n And ordering of search results does influence people, says Martin Moore, director of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King\u2019s College, London, who has written at length on the impact of the big tech companies on our civic and political spheres. \u201cThere\u2019s large-scale, statistically significant research into the impact of search results on political views. And the way in which you see the results and the types of results you see on the page necessarily has an impact on your perspective.\u201d Fake news, he says, has simply \u201crevealed a much bigger problem. These companies are so powerful and so committed to disruption. They thought they were disrupting politics but in a positive way. They hadn\u2019t thought about the downsides. These tools offer remarkable empowerment, but there\u2019s a dark side to it. It enables people to do very cynical, damaging things.\u201d \n \n Google is knowledge. It\u2019s where you go to find things out. And evil Jews are just the start of it. There are also evil women. I didn\u2019t go looking for them either. This is what I type: \u201ca-r-e w-o-m-e-n\u201d. And Google offers me just two choices, the first of which is: \u201cAre women evil?\u201d I press return. Yes, they are. Every one of the 10 results \u201cconfirms\u201d that they are, including the top one, from a site called sheddingoftheego.com, which is boxed out and highlighted: \u201cEvery woman has some degree of prostitute in her. Every woman has a little evil in her\u2026 Women don\u2019t love men, they love what they can do for them. It is within reason to say women feel attraction but they cannot love men.\u201d \n \n Next I type: \u201ca-r-e m-u-s-l-i-m-s\u201d. And Google suggests I should ask: \u201cAre Muslims bad?\u201d And here\u2019s what I find out: yes, they are. That\u2019s what the top result says and six of the others. Without typing anything else, simply putting the cursor in the search box, Google offers me two new searches and I go for the first, \u201cIslam is bad for society\u201d. In the next list of suggestions, I\u2019m offered: \u201cIslam must be destroyed.\u201d \n \n This is the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate Danny Sullivan \n \n Jews are evil. Muslims need to be eradicated. And Hitler? Do you want to know about Hitler? Let\u2019s Google it. \u201cWas Hitler bad?\u201d I type. And here\u2019s Google\u2019s top result: \u201c10 Reasons Why Hitler Was One Of The Good Guys\u201d I click on the link: \u201cHe never wanted to kill any Jews\u201d; \u201che cared about conditions for Jews in the work camps\u201d; \u201che implemented social and cultural reform.\u201d Eight out of the other 10 search results agree: Hitler really wasn\u2019t that bad. \n \n A few days later, I talk to Danny Sullivan, the founding editor of SearchEngineLand.com. He\u2019s been recommended to me by several academics as one of the most knowledgeable experts on search. Am I just being naive, I ask him? Should I have known this was out there? \u201cNo, you\u2019re not being naive,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is awful. It\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s the equivalent of going into a library and asking a librarian about Judaism and being handed 10 books of hate. Google is doing a horrible, horrible job of delivering answers here. It can and should do better.\u201d \n \n He\u2019s surprised too. \u201cI thought they stopped offering autocomplete suggestions for religions in 2011.\u201d And then he types \u201care women\u201d into his own computer. \u201cGood lord! That answer at the top. It\u2019s a featured result. It\u2019s called a \u201cdirect answer\u201d. This is supposed to be indisputable. It\u2019s Google\u2019s highest endorsement.\u201d That every women has some degree of prostitute in her? \u201cYes. This is Google\u2019s algorithm going terribly wrong.\u201d \n \n I contacted Google about its seemingly malfunctioning autocomplete suggestions and received the following response: \u201cOur search results are a reflection of the content across the web. This means that sometimes unpleasant portrayals of sensitive subject matter online can affect what search results appear for a given query. These results don\u2019t reflect Google\u2019s own opinions or beliefs \u2013 as a company, we strongly value a diversity of perspectives, ideas and cultures.\u201d \n \n Google isn\u2019t just a search engine, of course. Search was the foundation of the company but that was just the beginning. Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company, now has the greatest concentration of artificial intelligence experts in the world. It is expanding into healthcare, transportation, energy. It\u2019s able to attract the world\u2019s top computer scientists, physicists and engineers. It\u2019s bought hundreds of start-ups, including Calico, whose stated mission is to \u201ccure death\u201d and DeepMind, which aims to \u201csolve intelligence\u201d. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2002. Photograph: Michael Grecco/Getty Images \n \n And 20 years ago it didn\u2019t even exist. When Tony Blair became prime minister, it wasn\u2019t possible to Google him: the search engine had yet to be invented. The company was only founded in 1998 and Facebook didn\u2019t appear until 2004. Google\u2019s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page are still only 43. Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook is 32. Everything they\u2019ve done, the world they\u2019ve remade, has been done in the blink of an eye. \n \n But it seems the implications about the power and reach of these companies is only now seeping into the public consciousness. I ask Rebecca MacKinnon, director of the Ranking Digital Rights project at the New America Foundation, whether it was the recent furore over fake news that woke people up to the danger of ceding our rights as citizens to corporations. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird right now,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause people are finally saying, \u2018Gee, Facebook and Google really have a lot of power\u2019 like it\u2019s this big revelation. And it\u2019s like, \u2018D\u2019oh.\u2019\u201d \n \n MacKinnon has a particular expertise in how authoritarian governments adapt to the internet and bend it to their purposes. \u201cChina and Russia are a cautionary tale for us. I think what happens is that it goes back and forth. So during the Arab spring, it seemed like the good guys were further ahead. And now it seems like the bad guys are. Pro-democracy activists are using the internet more than ever but at the same time, the adversary has gotten so much more skilled.\u201d \n \n Last week Jonathan Albright, an assistant professor of communications at Elon University in North Carolina, published the first detailed research on how rightwing websites had spread their message. \u201cI took a list of these fake news sites that was circulating, I had an initial list of 306 of them and I used a tool \u2013 like the one Google uses \u2013 to scrape them for links and then I mapped them. So I looked at where the links went \u2013 into YouTube and Facebook, and between each other, millions of them\u2026 and I just couldn\u2019t believe what I was seeing. \n \n \u201cThey have created a web that is bleeding through on to our web. This isn\u2019t a conspiracy. There isn\u2019t one person who\u2019s created this. It\u2019s a vast system of hundreds of different sites that are using all the same tricks that all websites use. They\u2019re sending out thousands of links to other sites and together this has created a vast satellite system of rightwing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system.\u201d \n \n He found 23,000 pages and 1.3m hyperlinks. \u201cAnd Facebook is just the amplification device. When you look at it in 3D, it actually looks like a virus. And Facebook was just one of the hosts for the virus that helps it spread faster. You can see the New York Times in there and the Washington Post and then you can see how there\u2019s a vast, vast network surrounding them. The best way of describing it is as an ecosystem. This really goes way beyond individual sites or individual stories. What this map shows is the distribution network and you can see that it\u2019s surrounding and actually choking the mainstream news ecosystem.\u201d \n \n Like a cancer? \u201cLike an organism that is growing and getting stronger all the time.\u201d \n \n Charlie Beckett, a professor in the school of media and communications at LSE, tells me: \u201cWe\u2019ve been arguing for some time now that plurality of news media is good. Diversity is good. Critiquing the mainstream media is good. But now\u2026 it\u2019s gone wildly out of control. What Jonathan Albright\u2019s research has shown is that this isn\u2019t a byproduct of the internet. And it\u2019s not even being done for commercial reasons. It\u2019s motivated by ideology, by people who are quite deliberately trying to destabilise the internet.\u201d \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest A spatial map of the rightwing fake news ecosystem. Jonathan Albright, assistant professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, \u201cscraped\u201d 300 fake news sites (the dark shapes on this map) to reveal the 1.3m hyperlinks that connect them together and link them into the mainstream news ecosystem. Here, Albright shows it is a \u201cvast satellite system of rightwing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system\u201d. Photograph: Jonathan Albright \n \n Albright\u2019s map also provides a clue to understanding the Google search results I found. What these rightwing news sites have done, he explains, is what most commercial websites try to do. They try to find the tricks that will move them up Google\u2019s PageRank system. They try and \u201cgame\u201d the algorithm. And what his map shows is how well they\u2019re doing that. \n \n That\u2019s what my searches are showing too. That the right has colonised the digital space around these subjects \u2013 Muslims, women, Jews, the Holocaust, black people \u2013 far more effectively than the liberal left. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s an information war,\u201d says Albright. \u201cThat\u2019s what I keep coming back to.\u201d \n \n But it\u2019s where it goes from here that\u2019s truly frightening. I ask him how it can be stopped. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure it can be. It\u2019s a network. It\u2019s far more powerful than any one actor.\u201d \n \n So, it\u2019s almost got a life of its own? \u201cYes, and it\u2019s learning. Every day, it\u2019s getting stronger.\u201d \n \n The more people who search for information about Jews, the more people will see links to hate sites, and the more they click on those links (very few people click on to the second page of results) the more traffic the sites will get, the more links they will accrue and the more authoritative they will appear. This is an entirely circular knowledge economy that has only one outcome: an amplification of the message. Jews are evil. Women are evil. Islam must be destroyed. Hitler was one of the good guys. \n \n Fake news and a 400-year-old problem: we need to resolve the \u2018post-truth\u2019 crisis Read more \n \n And the constellation of websites that Albright found \u2013 a sort of shadow internet \u2013 has another function. More than just spreading rightwing ideology, they are being used to track and monitor and influence anyone who comes across their content. \u201cI scraped the trackers on these sites and I was absolutely dumbfounded. Every time someone likes one of these posts on Facebook or visits one of these websites, the scripts are then following you around the web. And this enables data-mining and influencing companies like Cambridge Analytica to precisely target individuals, to follow them around the web, and to send them highly personalised political messages. This is a propaganda machine. It\u2019s targeting people individually to recruit them to an idea. It\u2019s a level of social engineering that I\u2019ve never seen before. They\u2019re capturing people and then keeping them on an emotional leash and never letting them go.\u201d \n \n Cambridge Analytica, an American-owned company based in London, was employed by both the Vote Leave campaign and the Trump campaign. Dominic Cummings, the campaign director of Vote Leave, has made few public announcements since the Brexit referendum but he did say this: \u201cIf you want to make big improvements in communication, my advice is \u2013 hire physicists.\u201d \n \n Steve Bannon, founder of Breitbart News and the newly appointed chief strategist to Trump, is on Cambridge Analytica\u2019s board and it has emerged that the company is in talks to undertake political messaging work for the Trump administration. It claims to have built psychological profiles using 5,000 separate pieces of data on 220 million American voters. It knows their quirks and nuances and daily habits and can target them individually. \n \n \u201cThey were using 40-50,000 different variants of ad every day that were continuously measuring responses and then adapting and evolving based on that response,\u201d says Martin Moore of Kings College. Because they have so much data on individuals and they use such phenomenally powerful distribution networks, they allow campaigns to bypass a lot of existing laws. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s all done completely opaquely and they can spend as much money as they like on particular locations because you can focus on a five-mile radius or even a single demographic. Fake news is important but it\u2019s only one part of it. These companies have found a way of transgressing 150 years of legislation that we\u2019ve developed to make elections fair and open.\u201d \n \n Did such micro-targeted propaganda \u2013 currently legal \u2013 swing the Brexit vote? We have no way of knowing. Did the same methods used by Cambridge Analytica help Trump to victory? Again, we have no way of knowing. This is all happening in complete darkness. We have no way of knowing how our personal data is being mined and used to influence us. We don\u2019t realise that the Facebook page we are looking at, the Google page, the ads that we are seeing, the search results we are using, are all being personalised to us. We don\u2019t see it because we have nothing to compare it to. And it is not being monitored or recorded. It is not being regulated. We are inside a machine and we simply have no way of seeing the controls. Most of the time, we don\u2019t even realise that there are controls. \n \n Facebook and Google move to kick fake news sites off their ad networks Read more \n \n Rebecca MacKinnon says that most of us consider the internet to be like \u201cthe air that we breathe and the water that we drink\u201d. It surrounds us. We use it. And we don\u2019t question it. \u201cBut this is not a natural landscape. Programmers and executives and editors and designers, they make this landscape. They are human beings and they all make choices.\u201d \n \n But we don\u2019t know what choices they are making. Neither Google or Facebook make their algorithms public. Why did my Google search return nine out of 10 search results that claim Jews are evil? We don\u2019t know and we have no way of knowing. Their systems are what Frank Pasquale describes as \u201cblack boxes\u201d. He calls Google and Facebook \u201ca terrifying duopoly of power\u201d and has been leading a growing movement of academics who are calling for \u201calgorithmic accountability\u201d. \u201cWe need to have regular audits of these systems,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need people in these companies to be accountable. In the US, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, every company has to have a spokesman you can reach. And this is what needs to happen. They need to respond to complaints about hate speech, about bias.\u201d \n \n Is bias built into the system? Does it affect the kind of results that I was seeing? \u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of bias about what counts as a legitimate source of information and how that\u2019s weighted. There\u2019s enormous commercial bias. And when you look at the personnel, they are young, white and perhaps Asian, but not black or Hispanic and they are overwhelmingly men. The worldview of young wealthy white men informs all these judgments.\u201d \n \n Later, I speak to Robert Epstein, a research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioural Research and Technology, and the author of the study that Martin Moore told me about (and that Google has publicly criticised), showing how search-rank results affect voting patterns. On the other end of the phone, he repeats one of the searches I did. He types \u201cdo blacks\u2026\u201d into Google. \n \n \u201cLook at that. I haven\u2019t even hit a button and it\u2019s automatically populated the page with answers to the query: \u2018Do blacks commit more crimes?\u2019 And look, I could have been going to ask all sorts of questions. \u2018Do blacks excel at sports\u2019, or anything. And it\u2019s only given me two choices and these aren\u2019t simply search-based or the most searched terms right now. Google used to use that but now they use an algorithm that looks at other things. Now, let me look at Bing and Yahoo. I\u2019m on Yahoo and I have 10 suggestions, not one of which is \u2018Do black people commit more crime?\u2019 \n \n \u201cAnd people don\u2019t question this. Google isn\u2019t just offering a suggestion. This is a negative suggestion and we know that negative suggestions depending on lots of things can draw between five and 15 more clicks. And this all programmed. And it could be programmed differently.\u201d \n \n What Epstein\u2019s work has shown is that the contents of a page of search results can influence people\u2019s views and opinions. The type and order of search rankings was shown to influence voters in India in double-blind trials. There were similar results relating to the search suggestions you are offered. \n \n \u201cThe general public are completely in the dark about very fundamental issues regarding online search and influence. We are talking about the most powerful mind-control machine ever invented in the history of the human race. And people don\u2019t even notice it.\u201d \n \n Good luck in making Google reveal its algorithm | John Naughton Read more \n \n Damien Tambini, an associate professor at the London School of Economics, who focuses on media regulation, says that we lack any sort of framework to deal with the potential impact of these companies on the democratic process. \u201cWe have structures that deal with powerful media corporations. We have competition laws. But these companies are not being held responsible. There are no powers to get Google or Facebook to disclose anything. There\u2019s an editorial function to Google and Facebook but it\u2019s being done by sophisticated algorithms. They say it\u2019s machines not editors. But that\u2019s simply a mechanised editorial function.\u201d \n \n And the companies, says John Naughton, the Observer columnist and a senior research fellow at Cambridge University, are terrified of acquiring editorial responsibilities they don\u2019t want. \u201cThough they can and regularly do tweak the results in all sorts of ways.\u201d \n \n Certainly the results about Google on Google don\u2019t seem entirely neutral. Google \u201cIs Google racist?\u201d and the featured result \u2013 the Google answer boxed out at the top of the page \u2013 is quite clear: no. It is not. \n \n Google and Facebook are thinking long term. They have the resources, money and ambition to do whatever they want John Naughton \n \n But the enormity and complexity of having two global companies of a kind we have never seen before influencing so many areas of our lives is such, says Naughton, that \u201cwe don\u2019t even have the mental apparatus to even know what the problems are\u201d. \n \n And this is especially true of the future. Google and Facebook are at the forefront of AI. They are going to own the future. And the rest of us can barely start to frame the sorts of questions we ought to be asking. \u201cPoliticians don\u2019t think long term. And corporations don\u2019t think long term because they\u2019re focused on the next quarterly results and that\u2019s what makes Google and Facebook interesting and different. They are absolutely thinking long term. They have the resources, the money, and the ambition to do whatever they want. \n \n \u201cThey want to digitise every book in the world: they do it. They want to build a self-driving car: they do it. The fact that people are reading about these fake news stories and realising that this could have an effect on politics and elections, it\u2019s like, \u2018Which planet have you been living on?\u2019 For Christ\u2019s sake, this is obvious.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe internet is among the few things that humans have built that they don\u2019t understand.\u201d It is \u201cthe largest experiment involving anarchy in history. Hundreds of millions of people are, each minute, creating and consuming an untold amount of digital content in an online world that is not truly bound by terrestrial laws.\u201d The internet as a lawless anarchic state? A massive human experiment with no checks and balances and untold potential consequences? What kind of digital doom-mongerer would say such a thing? Step forward, Eric Schmidt \u2013 Google\u2019s chairman. They are the first lines of the book, The New Digital Age, that he wrote with Jared Cohen. \n \n We don\u2019t understand it. It is not bound by terrestrial laws. And it\u2019s in the hands of two massive, all-powerful corporations. It\u2019s their experiment, not ours. The technology that was supposed to set us free may well have helped Trump to power, or covertly helped swing votes for Brexit. It has created a vast network of propaganda that has encroached like a cancer across the entire internet. This is a technology that has enabled the likes of Cambridge Analytica to create political messages uniquely tailored to you. They understand your emotional responses and how to trigger them. They know your likes, dislikes, where you live, what you eat, what makes you laugh, what makes you cry. \n \n And what next? Rebecca MacKinnon\u2019s research has shown how authoritarian regimes reshape the internet for their own purposes. Is that what\u2019s going to happen with Silicon Valley and Trump? As Martin Moore points out, the president-elect claimed that Apple chief executive Tim Cook called to congratulate him soon after his election victory. \u201cAnd there will undoubtedly be be pressure on them to collaborate,\u201d says Moore. \n \n Journalism is failing in the face of such change and is only going to fail further. New platforms have put a bomb under the financial model \u2013 advertising \u2013 resources are shrinking, traffic is increasingly dependent on them, and publishers have no access, no insight at all, into what these platforms are doing in their headquarters, their labs. And now they are moving beyond the digital world into the physical. The next frontiers are healthcare, transportation, energy. And just as Google is a near-monopoly for search, its ambition to own and control the physical infrastructure of our lives is what\u2019s coming next. It already owns our data and with it our identity. What will it mean when it moves into all the other areas of our lives? \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg: still only 32 years of age. Photograph: Mariana Bazo/Reuters \n \n \u201cAt the moment, there\u2019s a distance when you Google \u2018Jews are\u2019 and get \u2018Jews are evil\u2019,\u201d says Julia Powles, a researcher at Cambridge on technology and law. \u201cBut when you move into the physical realm, and these concepts become part of the tools being deployed when you navigate around your city or influence how people are employed, I think that has really pernicious consequences.\u201d \n \n Powles is shortly to publish a paper looking at DeepMind\u2019s relationship with the NHS. \u201cA year ago, 2 million Londoners\u2019 NHS health records were handed over to DeepMind. And there was complete silence from politicians, from regulators, from anyone in a position of power. This is a company without any healthcare experience being given unprecedented access into the NHS and it took seven months to even know that they had the data. And that took investigative journalism to find it out.\u201d \n \n The headline was that DeepMind was going to work with the NHS to develop an app that would provide early warning for sufferers of kidney disease. And it is, but DeepMind\u2019s ambitions \u2013 \u201cto solve intelligence\u201d \u2013 goes way beyond that. The entire history of 2 million NHS patients is, for artificial intelligence researchers, a treasure trove. And, their entry into the NHS \u2013 providing useful services in exchange for our personal data \u2013 is another massive step in their power and influence in every part of our lives. \n \n Because the stage beyond search is prediction. Google wants to know what you want before you know yourself. \u201cThat\u2019s the next stage,\u201d says Martin Moore. \u201cWe talk about the omniscience of these tech giants, but that omniscience takes a huge step forward again if they are able to predict. And that\u2019s where they want to go. To predict diseases in health. It\u2019s really, really problematic.\u201d \n \n For the nearly 20 years that Google has been in existence, our view of the company has been inflected by the youth and liberal outlook of its founders. Ditto Facebook, whose mission, Zuckberg said, was not to be \u201ca company. It was built to accomplish a social mission to make the world more open and connected.\u201d \n \n The more we argue with them, the more they know about us. It all feeds into a circular system Jonathan Albright \n \n It would be interesting to know how he thinks that\u2019s working out. Donald Trump is connecting through exactly the same technology platforms that supposedly helped fuel the Arab spring; connecting to racists and xenophobes. And Facebook and Google are amplifying and spreading that message. And us too \u2013 the mainstream media. Our outrage is just another node on Jonathan Albright\u2019s data map. \n \n \u201cThe more we argue with them, the more they know about us,\u201d he says. \u201cIt all feeds into a circular system. What we\u2019re seeing here is new era of network propaganda.\u201d \n \n We are all points on that map. And our complicity, our credulity, being consumers not concerned citizens, is an essential part of that process. And what happens next is down to us. \u201cI would say that everybody has been really naive and we need to reset ourselves to a much more cynical place and proceed on that basis,\u201d is Rebecca MacKinnon\u2019s advice. \u201cThere is no doubt that where we are now is a very bad place. But it\u2019s we as a society who have jointly created this problem. And if we want to get to a better place, when it comes to having an information ecosystem that serves human rights and democracy instead of destroying it, we have to share responsibility for that.\u201d \n \n Are Jews evil? How do you want that question answered? This is our internet. Not Google\u2019s. Not Facebook\u2019s. Not rightwing propagandists. And we\u2019re the only ones who can reclaim it.",

    "document": "The world's first \"three parent baby\" was born five months ago to Jordanian parents. The treatment, which seeks to avoid mothers passing defective mitochondrial DNA to their offspring, was performed in Mexico. \n \n The news, revealed by the New Scientist, is already hailed as revolutionary advance in the field of reproductive medicine. The procedure - based on a new In vitro fertilisation technique that incorporates DNA from three parents - was necessary because the baby's mother carries mitochondrial DNA mutations for Leigh syndrome, a fatal neurological disorder. \n \n Because of this, she and her husband had already lost two children, so they asked a US-based team of scientists \u2013 at New Hope Fertility Center in New York City \u2013 for their help. The doctors, led by John Zhang, designed a new \"three-parent\" technique. \n \n The traditional way to do this is to use a method known as pronuclear transfer, which involves fertilising both the mother's egg and a donor's egg with the father's sperm. When both eggs start dividing into early-stage embryos, scientists remove the nucleus. The nucleus from the donor's egg is discarded, and the one from the mother is inserted in its place. This is the technique that was legally approved in the UK in 2015. \n \n However, the couple rejected this technique for religious reasons \u2013 they didn't want an embryo to be discarded. Thus, another \"three parent\" technique, known as spindle nuclear transfer, was used: the nucleus was first removed from the mother's egg and inserted into a donor's egg, after removing its own nucleus. Only then was the resulting egg fertilised with the father's sperm. \n \n The complete findings will be presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine's Scientific Congress in Salt Lake City in October, but already it represents a huge step forward for a technique that has often attracted a lot of heated debates. \n \n The idea of three parent babies previously sparked criticism from some groups, which claimed it could pave the way for \"designer babies\". At the time of its approval in the UK, England's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies commented: \"The intention in making these regulations is to ensure that mothers who carry faulty mitochondria can have healthy children free from devastating and often deadly conditions caused by serious mitochondrial disease. \n \n \"It is important to remember that mitochondrial DNA represents less than 0.054 per cent of the total DNA, and is not part of the nuclear DNA, which determines our personal characteristics and traits such as personality, hair and eye colour.\" ||||| Leigh syndrome can be caused by mutations in one of more than 75 different genes. In humans, most genes are found in DNA in the cell's , called nuclear DNA. However, some genes are found in DNA in specialized structures in the cell called . This type of DNA is known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). While most people with Leigh syndrome have a mutation in nuclear DNA, about 20 percent have a mutation in mtDNA. \n \n Most genes associated with Leigh syndrome are involved in the process of energy production in mitochondria. Mitochondria use oxygen to convert the energy from food into a form cells can use through a process called . Five protein complexes, made up of several proteins each, are involved in this process. The complexes are named complex I, complex II, complex III, complex IV, and complex V. During oxidative phosphorylation, the protein complexes drive the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source, through a step-by-step transfer of negatively charged particles called electrons. Many of the gene mutations associated with Leigh syndrome affect proteins in these complexes or disrupt their assembly. These mutations reduce or eliminate the activity of one or more of these complexes, which can lead to Leigh syndrome. \n \n Disruption of complex I, also called NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, is the most common cause of Leigh syndrome, accounting for nearly one third of cases of the condition. At least 25 genes involved in the formation of complex I, found in either nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, have been associated with Leigh syndrome. \n \n Disruption of complex IV, also called cytochrome c oxidase or COX, is also a common cause of Leigh syndrome, underlying approximately 15 percent of cases. One of the most frequently mutated genes in Leigh syndrome is SURF1. This gene, which is found in nuclear DNA, provides instructions for making a protein that helps assemble the COX protein complex (complex IV). This complex, which is involved in the last step of electron transfer in oxidative phosphorylation, provides the energy that will be used in the next step of the process to generate ATP. Mutations in the SURF1 gene typically lead to an abnormally short SURF1 protein that is broken down in cells, resulting in the absence of functional SURF1 protein. The loss of this protein reduces the formation of normal COX complexes, which impairs mitochondrial energy production. \n \n The most common mtDNA mutation in Leigh syndrome affects the MT-ATP6 gene, which provides instructions for making a piece of complex V, also known as the . Using the energy provided by the other protein complexes, the ATP synthase complex generates ATP. MT-ATP6 gene mutations, found in approximately 10 percent of people with Leigh syndrome, block the generation of ATP. Other mtDNA mutations associated with Leigh syndrome decrease the activity of other oxidative phosphorylation protein complexes or lead to reduced formation of mitochondrial proteins, all of which impair mitochondrial energy production. \n \n Other gene mutations associated with Leigh syndrome decrease the activity of one or more oxidative phosphorylation protein complexes or affect additional steps related to energy production. For example, Leigh syndrome can be caused by mutations in genes that form the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or coenzyme Q10, both of which are involved in mitochondrial energy production. Mutations in genes that direct the replication of mtDNA or the production of mitochondrial proteins can also disrupt mitochondrial energy production. \n \n Although the exact mechanism is unclear, researchers believe that impaired oxidative phosphorylation can lead to cell death because of decreased energy available in the cell. Certain tissues that require large amounts of energy, such as the brain, muscles, and heart, seem especially sensitive to decreases in cellular energy. Cell death in the brain likely causes the characteristic lesions seen in Leigh syndrome, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of the condition. Cell death in other sensitive tissues may also contribute to the features of Leigh syndrome. ||||| Blackout Concepts/Alamy \n \n It\u2019s a boy! A five-month-old boy is the first baby to be born using a new technique that incorporates DNA from three people, New Scientist can reveal. \u201cThis is great news and a huge deal,\u201d says Dusko Ilic at King\u2019s College London, who wasn\u2019t involved in the work. \u201cIt\u2019s revolutionary.\u201d \n \n The controversial technique, which allows parents with rare genetic mutations to have healthy babies, has only been legally approved in the UK. But the birth of the child, whose Jordanian parents were treated by a US-based team in Mexico, should fast-forward progress around the world, say embryologists. \n \n The boy\u2019s mother carries genes for Leigh syndrome, a fatal disorder that affects the developing nervous system. Genes for the disease reside in DNA in the mitochondria, which provide energy for our cells and carry just 37 genes that are passed down to us from our mothers. This is separate from the majority of our DNA, which is housed in each cell\u2019s nucleus. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Around a quarter of her mitochondria have the disease-causing mutation. While she is healthy, Leigh syndrome was responsible for the deaths of her first two children. The couple sought out the help of John Zhang and his team at the New Hope Fertility Center in New York City. \n \n Zhang has been working on a way to avoid mitochondrial disease using a so-called \u201cthree-parent\u201d technique. In theory, there are a few ways of doing this. The method approved in the UK is called pronuclear transfer and involves fertilising both the mother\u2019s egg and a donor egg with the father\u2019s sperm. Before the fertilised eggs start dividing into early-stage embryos, each nucleus is removed. The nucleus from the donor\u2019s fertilised egg is discarded and replaced by that from the mother\u2019s fertilised egg. \n \n Meet your mitochondria: The powerful aliens that lurk within you \n \n \n \n But this technique wasn\u2019t appropriate for the couple \u2013 as Muslims, they were opposed to the destruction of two embryos. So Zhang took a different approach, called spindle nuclear transfer. He removed the nucleus from one of the mother\u2019s eggs and inserted it into a donor egg that had had its own nucleus removed. The resulting egg \u2013 with nuclear DNA from the mother and mitochondrial DNA from a donor \u2013 was then fertilised with the father\u2019s sperm. \n \n Gene editing: A guide to the genetic revolution on our doorstep \n \n \n \n Zhang\u2019s team used this approach to create five embryos, only one of which developed normally. This embryo was implanted in the mother and the child was born nine months later. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting news,\u201d says Bert Smeets at Maastricht University in the Netherlands. The team will describe the findings at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine\u2019s Scientific Congress in Salt Lake City in October. \n \n Neither method has been approved in the US, so Zhang went to Mexico instead, where he says \u201cthere are no rules\u201d. He is adamant that he made the right choice. \u201cTo save lives is the ethical thing to do,\u201d he says. \n \n The team seems to have taken an ethical approach with their technique, says Sian Harding, who reviewed the ethics of the UK procedure. The team avoided destroying embryos, and used a male embryo, so that the resulting child wouldn\u2019t pass on any inherited mitochondrial DNA. \u201cIt\u2019s as good as or better than what we\u2019ll do in the UK,\u201d says Harding. \n \n A remaining concern is safety. Last time embryologists tried to create a baby using DNA from three people was in the 1990s, when they injected mitochondrial DNA from a donor into another woman\u2019s egg, along with sperm from her partner. Two of the fetuses developed genetic disorders, and the technique was halted by the US Food and Drug Administration. The problem may have arisen from the fetuses having mitochondria from two sources. \n \n When Zhang and his colleagues tested the boy\u2019s mitochondria, they found that less than 1 per cent carry the mutation. Hopefully, this is too low to cause any problems; generally it is thought to take around 18 per cent of mitochondria to be affected before problems start. \u201cIt\u2019s very good,\u201d says Ilic. \n \n Smeets agrees, but cautions that the team should monitor the child to make sure the levels stay low. There\u2019s a chance that faulty mitochondria could be better at replicating, and gradually increase in number, he says. \u201cWe need to wait for more births, and to carefully judge them,\u201d says Smeets. \n \n Two women, one man and a baby A Jordanian couple has been trying to start a family for almost 20 years. Ten years after they married, she became pregnant, but it ended in the first of four miscarriages. In 2005, the couple gave birth to a baby girl. It was then that they discovered the probable cause of their fertility problems: a genetic mutation in the mother\u2019s mitochondria. Their daughter was born with Leigh syndrome, which affects the brain, muscles and nerves of developing infants. Sadly, she died aged six. The couple\u2019s second child had the same disorder, and lived for 8 months. Using a controversial \u201cthree-parent baby\u201d technique (see main story), the boy was born on 6 April 2016. He is showing no signs of disease. \n \n At the clinic\u2019s request we have removed the names of the family The story has been updated to clarify that it was fetuses that developed genetic disorders in the 1990s ||||| Alana Saarinen loves playing golf and the piano, listening to music and hanging out with friends. In those respects, she's like many teenagers around the world. Except she's not, because every cell in Alana's body isn't like mine and yours - Alana is one of a few people in the world who have DNA from three people. \n \n \"A lot of people say I have facial features from my mum, my eyes look like my dad\u2026 I have some traits from them and my personality is the same too,\" says Alana. \n \n \"I also have DNA from a third lady. But I wouldn't consider her a third parent, I just have some of her mitochondria.\" \n \n Mitochondria are often called the cell's factories. They are the bits that create the energy all of our cells need to work, and keep the body functioning. But they also contain a little bit of DNA. \n \n Alana Saarinen is one of only 30 to 50 people in the world who have some mitochondria, and therefore a bit of DNA, from a third person. She was conceived through a pioneering infertility treatment in the USA which was later banned. \n \n But soon there could be more people like Alana, with three genetic parents, because the UK is looking to legalise a new, similar technique which would use a donor's mitochondria to try to eliminate debilitating genetic diseases. It is called mitochondrial replacement and if Parliament votes to let this happen, the UK would become the only country in the world to allow children with three people's DNA to be born. \n \n The structure of a cell \n \n Nucleus: Where the majority of our DNA is held - this determines how we look and our personality \n \n Mitochondria: Often described as the cell's factories, these create the energy to make the cell function \n \n Cytoplasm: The jelly like substance that contains the nucleus and mitochondria \n \n Alana was born through an infertility treatment called cytoplasmic transfer. \n \n Her mum, Sharon Saarinen, had been trying to have a baby for 10 years through numerous IVF procedures. \n \n \"I felt worthless. I felt guilty that I couldn't give my husband a child. When you want a biological child but you can't have one, you're distraught. You can't sleep, it's 24-7, constantly on your mind,\" she says. \n \n Cytoplasmic transfer was pioneered in the late 1990s by a clinical embryologist Dr Jacques Cohen and his team at the St Barnabus Institute in New Jersey, US. \n \n \"We felt that there was a chance that there was some element, some structure in the cytoplasm that didn't function optimally. One of the major candidates that could have been involved here are structures called mitochondria,\" he says. \n \n Cohen transferred a bit of a donor woman's cytoplasm, containing mitochondria, to Sharon Saarinen's egg. It was then fertilised with her husband's sperm. As a little bit of mitochondria was transferred, some DNA from the donor was in the embryo. \n \n Image copyright Science Photo Library \n \n Seventeen babies were born at Cohen's clinic, as a result of cytoplasmic transfer, who could have had DNA from three people. \n \n But there was concern about some of the babies. \n \n \"There was one early miscarriage, considering there were twelve pregnancies that is an expected number,\" says Cohen. \n \n He and his team believed that miscarriage occurred because the foetus was missing an X chromosome. \n \n \"Then there was another twin pregnancy, where one [of the twins] was considered entirely normal and the other had a missing X chromosome. \n \n Find out more Listen to Mum and Dad... and Mum? on BBC Radio 4 at 21:00 BST or on the World Service at 18:30 on Monday 1 September, or watch the film on BBC Newsnight at 22:30 on the same date Or catch up on iPlayer \n \n \"So that's two out of the small group of foetuses that was obtained from this procedure. This did worry us and we reported that in the literature and in our ethical and review board that oversees these procedures,\" he says. \n \n At the time of birth, the other babies were all fine. A year or two later, another of the children was found to have \"early signs of pervasive early developmental disorder which is a range of cognitive diseases which also includes autism.\" Cohen told me. \n \n He says it's difficult to know if the abnormalities happened by chance or because of the procedure. \n \n Other clinics copied the technique and Cohen estimates that around 30 to 50 children worldwide were born who could have DNA from three people as a result. \n \n But in 2002 the American regulator, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) asked clinics to stop doing cytoplasmic transfer due to safety and ethical concerns. All of them did. \n \n \"There was a reaction from scientists, ethicists, the public at large, I think most of it was supportive, some of it was critical - I think this is normal, every time an experiment is done in medicine there is a reaction - what are the risks here?\" says Cohen. \n \n At the time, some were concerned because they felt this was germ line genetic modification. What \"germ line\" means is that a child like Alana would pass her unusual genetic code down to her children. And their children, would pass it to their children and so on. \n \n Because we inherit our mitochondria only from our mothers, only female children would pass their unusual genetic code on. Crossing the germ line as it is known has never been done before so very little is known about what the outcome could be. \n \n Due to a lack of funding, Cohen says, it hasn't been possible to find out about how any of the children like Alana who were born from cytoplasmic transfer are doing. But the St Barnabus Institute is now starting a follow up study to check their progress. \n \n Sharon Saarinen says her daughter Alana is a healthy, typical teenager \n \n \"I couldn't ask for a better child. She is an intelligent, beautiful girl inside and out, she loves math and science \u2026 she does really well in school. She helps me around the house\u2026 when she's not texting!\" \n \n \"She has always been healthy. Never anything more than a basic cold, or a flu every now and then. No health problems at all.\" \n \n The health of the children, like Alana, born from cytoplasmic transfer is under scrutiny now because of the UK's decision to consider legalising mitochondrial replacement, where the mitochondria of a donor woman will be used to create a child. \n \n It would not be available for people with fertility problems but for those who carry diseases of the mitochondria and would otherwise pass down these genetic abnormalities to their children. \n \n Exactly how it is done still needs to be determined as there are two ways of doing the procedure, depending on when the eggs are fertilised. \n \n Eggs from a mother with unhealthy mitochondria and a donor with healthy mitochondria are collected \n \n The nucleus, containing the majority of the genetic material, is removed from both eggs. The donor nucleus is destroyed \n \n The mother's nucleus is inserted into the donor egg - it now has healthy mitochondria. The egg is then fertilised by the father's sperm \n \n Both the mother's and donor's eggs are fertilised with the father's sperm to create two embryos \n \n The pronuclei, the nuclei during the process of fertilisation, contain the majority of the genetic material. They are removed from both embryos. The donor's is destroyed \n \n A healthy embryo is created by putting the parents' pronuclei into the donor embryo \n \n \"Mitochondrial diseases tend to involve tissues or organs which are heavily dependent on energy,\" says Prof Doug Turnbull from The University of Newcastle. He has treated people with mitochondrial disease for decades and is one of those who has developed these new techniques to try to cure these debilitating diseases. \n \n \"The conditions can therefore involve the heart, the brain or sometimes the skeletal muscle,\" he says. \n \n \"People can have very bad heart problems which can cause the heart to fail eventually, they can be very weak and require respirators or be in a wheelchair. With the brain, they can get epilepsy, strokes and eventually severe dementia.\" \n \n Turnbull estimates that around 1 in 3000-5000 people in the UK have a mitochondrial disease. \"We can treat the symptoms. We can improve the quality and length of peoples' lives but we can't cure them.\" \n \n The mitochondria carry some DNA, around 13 \"important genes\" says Turnbull. \n \n That compares to the \"23,000 important genes\" in the nucleus where most of our DNA is held. This is the DNA that determines our traits and personality. \n \n \"We're not trying to create some characteristic that makes this person a stronger person or [someone who] will have blonde hair. We're trying to prevent disease and I think that is the only justification for doing this,\" he says. \n \n Sharon Bernardi, from Sunderland in the North of England, is someone who mitochondrial replacement could have helped. \n \n Image copyright other \n \n Bernardi has lost seven children to mitochondrial disease. \n \n \"I have babies in three different cemeteries,\" she told us in her sitting room, surrounded by photographs of all her children. \n \n \"That is not the way you plan your life when you're trying to have a family. I have lovely photos and lovely memories but obviously that's all I have got now.\" \n \n I have to slip back into reality and think don't be silly, Edward's not there. He's not in his room Sharon Bernardi \n \n The doctors didn't know why Bernardi's babies kept passing away only hours after they were born. So that's why she kept trying, hoping she would have a healthy child. \n \n With her fourth child, Edward, at first everything seemed different. He was healthy until he was about four and a half. But it was then that he was diagnosed with Leigh's disease, a type of mitochondrial disease, and his health deteriorated throughout the years. \n \n \"From the age of 20 Edward [found] getting around more difficult. He started to get new symptoms - spasms. He'd start screaming... four, five, six hours at a time. His muscles used to tense up, his hands, his face. It was like dystonic spasms - a really bad spasm. [For] eight hours he'd be in pain, screaming. His face would twist up and his hands would get really stiff. It was hard to see.\" \n \n Edward Bernardi passed away three years ago, when he was 21. \n \n \"My life was totally for Edward. Even now sometimes if I have gone to sleep, I still wake up, and think, 'It's very quiet.' I have to slip back into reality and think, 'Don't be silly, Edward's not there. He's not in his room'.\" \n \n \"Without a heartbeat I would have gone for this [mitochondrial replacement]. I hope this is a new option. I hope people take it seriously and it's approved. \n \n \"I don't want my son to have just died for nothing. I want him to have made a difference.\" \n \n \"His life was robbed at 21. We're trying to stop this. People have to understand this is a life disease. We're trying not to pass it on to children and make it better for future families.\" \n \n Image copyright other \n \n But some people believe this technique could set us on a slippery slope towards genetically modified humans. \n \n \"These regulations would authorise the crossing of a rubicon for the first time. It would authorise germ line therapy... to alter the genes of an individual. This is something defined by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as effectively constituting eugenics,\" says British MP Fiona Bruce who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Pro-Life Group. \n \n \"We will have approved a technique and what that technique could be used for in the future who knows. We're opening a Pandora's box.\" \n \n The regulator in the UK, the HFEA or Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, has held three independent reviews to scrutinise the safety of this technique. The conclusions were that mitochondrial replacement is \"not unsafe\". \n \n There have been few episodes I'm aware of in the history of assisted reproduction that have had to be stopped because of hazard Professor Braude, Kings College London \n \n That means \"it would be reasonable, with some additional experiments, to take it into clinical practice if all circumstances are fulfilled\" says Peter Braude, emeritus professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Kings College London. He sat on all three HFEA scientific reviews. \n \n \"In any move from science to clinical practice there is a leap of faith - it has to be done,\" he says. \n \n He adds that many of the concerns being raised now about this are the same as the ones cited in the early days of IVF. The UK has for decades been a leader in assisted reproduction science and is where the world's first test tube baby, Louise Brown, was born in 1978. \n \n \"The headlines then were 'playing God' and 'genetically modified humans',\" says Braude. \n \n \"There have been few episodes I'm aware of in the history of assisted reproduction that have had to be stopped because of hazard. It's all gone pretty swimmingly as far as I'm aware.\" \n \n Braude says that mitochondrial replacement has gone through much more scrutiny than previous, now well established, assisted reproduction techniques did, such as IVF. \n \n \"Whereas the original techniques were used with only [experiments from] mice, rabbits, lab animals... the big difference here is we also have issue of human embryos and this work has been tested in macaque monkeys in primates. All those were very useful, reassuring\u2026 hence why we came to the conclusion that this is not unsafe.\" \n \n The experiments done on macaque monkeys were done in Oregon, US and the monkeys are now five years old and seem to be healthy. \n \n Braude also points out that having a third person's DNA in your system is \"nothing particularly new\". \n \n \"Think about bone marrow transplants, let's say unfortunately you have leukaemia and you have to have your bone marrow radiated for the cancer to be killed and then it is replaced by bone marrow from someone else - say me. Effectively from that time onwards, you will have circulating in your body DNA from me. You won't be related to me, you may be grateful to me, but you will have DNA from a third person circulating in your body.\" \n \n What is different, say critics, about mitochondrial replacement, is that DNA from the donor will be passed down future generations. \n \n Image copyright Science Photo Library \n \n Dr Ted Morrow, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Sussex, and colleagues have carried out mitochondrial replacement experiments on other animals. He raised safety concerns about mitochondrial replacement to the scientific reviews. \n \n \"For mice, there were changes in cognitive ability... to learn and do things using their brain. In fruit flies and seed beetles there were changes in male fertility, changes in ageing, a range of different traits were effected in various experiments,\" he says. \n \n The HFEA's scientific reviews dismissed Morrow's findings as not relevant to humans because they were done on inbred animals. \n \n Morrow stands by his research and says the scientific panels should not have dismissed his findings so quickly. \n \n I'm a scientist but I'm not a pro-lifer. I think this is a genuine safety concern - that's it Ted Morrow, University of Sussex \n \n It is Morrow's evidence that critics such as Fiona Bruce cite when saying this technique is not safe enough. \n \n She has called a debate in the House of Commons today to discuss mitochondrial replacement. She does not believe there has been enough debate about what the UK is proposing to do. \"The technique itself could allow the child to inherit untried untested medical complications,\" she says. \n \n Morrow says that all the coverage of his research has been \"a rather odd experience\". \n \n \"In the press it's sometimes portrayed that the scientists think this, and the pro-life group this.

How can you thank someone for giving you a life? That's impossible,\" says Sharon. \n \n Alana agrees with her mum. \"I think it would be nice to thank her. But I wouldn't want to have a relationship or connection with her. The DNA I have of her is just so small.\" \n \n \"I know she might have another person's mitochondria, [but] look what a great person she turned out to be, and healthy.

The boy, IDed by the International Business Times as Abrahim Hassan, was born in Mexico to Jordanian parents, and embryologists are hoping his successful birth will hasten using the procedure elsewhere. Abrahim's mother, Shaban, carries the gene for Leigh syndrome\u2014a severe neurological condition that decimates mental and physical capabilities and often results in a child's death before kindergarten. Although Hassan herself is healthy, her first two children died from the disease. That's when she and her husband looked for assistance from NYC's New Hope Fertility Center, where a team led by Dr. John Zhang started them off on an alternative way to parenthood. There are a couple of different ways to pull off the three-parent technique, but the one they chose to go with is called spindle nuclear transfer, in which the nucleus from the mother's egg is placed in a donor egg whose own nucleus has been taken out; that egg, which then contains nuclear DNA from the mom and mitochondrial DNA from the donor, is fertilized with the father's sperm. Five embryos were created in this case, and when just one \"took,\" it was implanted into Hassan, who delivered Abrahim nine months later. This all had to be done in Mexico, where Zhang says \"there are no rules\" (the Times labels it \"relatively flexible legislation\"; the procedure isn't approved in the US). One concern scientists are keeping an eye on: faulty mitochondria that could replicate, a problem that may have occurred when the technique was last tried in the '90s. (The UK has OKed a controversial gene-editing method.)",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Five months ago, the world's first \"three parent\" baby was born to a Jordanian couple, New Scientist reports. The baby was born to a woman with Leigh syndrome, a fatal neurological disorder that can be caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, which is found in DNA in the cell's cells. The couple had already lost two children, so when they found out they had Leigh syndrome, they decided to try to have a third child without passing on the mutation. The traditional way to avoid such mutations is to use pronuclear transfer, which involves fertilizing both the mother's egg and a donor's egg with the father's sperm. When both eggs start dividing into early-stage embryos, the nucleus from the donor's egg is discarded, and the one from the mother is inserted in its place. However, the couple rejected this technique for religious reasons\u2014they didn't want an embryo to be discarded. Thus, another \"three parent\" technique, known as spindle nuclear transfer, was used: the nucleus was first removed from the mother's egg and inserted into a donor's egg, after removing its own nucleus. Only then was the resulting egg fertilised with the father's sperm. The complete findings will be presented at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine's Scientific Congress in Salt Lake City in October, but already it represents a huge step forward for a technique that has often attracted a lot of heated debates. The world's first \"three parent\" baby was born five months ago.",

    "document": "A pregnant woman in Delaware became a hero to two Maine families after her Facebook search helped find their missing teenage girls. \n \n Lisa Stephenson, a server at the Blue Crab Grill in Newark, Del., became suspicious on Nov. 2 when two teenaged girls walked in and applied for jobs. Both seemed too young to be looking for work, they weren\u2019t in school, and neither included home addresses or cellphone numbers on their job applications. \n \n STORY: Air Force Vet\u2019s Touching Reunion With \u2018Katrina Girl\u2019 \n \n \u201cIt seemed odd for teen girls not to have cellphones, nowadays,\u201d Stephenson, 26, who is six months pregnant, tells Yahoo Parenting. \n \n STORY: Man Reunites With Siblings After 40 Years, Discovers They\u2019d Met Before \n \n The girls claimed that their phones and money had been stolen in New York, and they had somehow ended up in Delaware. \n \n Stephenson worried what could happen to the girls at the two truck stops or no-questions-asked motels only minutes from the restaurant. \u201cThey were in sweats and it looked like they hadn\u2019t touched their hair in a while,\u201d said Stephenson. \u201cI immediately had a feeling they were runaways.\u201d \n \n If her daughter-to-be were ever missing, she thought, she would want someone to help. \n \n That evening after work, Stephenson did a Facebook search for the girls\u2019 names and landed on the page of a 16-year-old girl from Brunswick, Maine. Her mother had posted a missing persons notice about her daughter and a 14-year-old friend from Bath, Maine, who had vanished together on October 25 after failing to show up for a babysitting job. \n \n Stephenson sent the mom a friend request and shared that she had met the girls and then enlisted the help of her cousins \u2014 police deputies in a nearby county \u2014 who tracked them down after they were seen panhandling in front of a clothing store on Nov. 3. The girls had stolen one of their mother\u2019s cars and had driven \u201cstraight through Boston, New York, and some of the most scary places they could have been,\u201d the mom of the older girl told the Bangor Daily News. \n \n On the way home, the trio stopped at the Blue Crab Grill to thank Stephenson, who explained to the girls how close they came to real danger. The teens are now safe at home in Maine (although both are grounded and the older girl is banned from using social media) and Stephenson has been dubbed a hero by the older girl\u2019s mom. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t feel like a hero,\u201d insists Stephenson. \u201cI just feel like a normal person who needed to speak up and did.

So she glanced at the applications and discovered neither teen had listed an address or a phone number, and neither had completed high school. \n \n Concerned that the two girls were alone in an area just down the road from a truck stop that is \u201cnot a really good place to be around,\u201d Stephenson wrote down their names. \n \n A quick search of Facebook when she got home that night confirmed her instincts: A Brunswick woman was frantically searching for her 16-year-old Brunswick daughter, who, along with a 14-year-old Bath girl, had disappeared in the early morning hours of Oct. 25. \n \n The girls were supposed to babysit together early Sunday morning, the older girl\u2019s mom told the Bangor Daily News, but they never showed up. Before long, the younger girl\u2019s mom realized her Toyota Camry was missing. \n \n Both mothers spent Sunday in a fog, mystified at their daughters\u2019 disappearance and terrified for their safety. They posted \u201cMissing\u201d notices on Facebook, and contacted the Bath teen\u2019s family in South Carolina, where she was born and previously lived, thinking the girls might be headed to see a friend there. \n \n After Bath police had listed the girls with the National Crime Information Center, alerting police across the country to stop them, police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, called later Sunday morning to report the car had been involved in a minor crash before driving away from the scene, Bath Police Lt. Robert Savary said at the time. Neither teen has a license to drive, according to the older girl\u2019s mom. \n \n Then there was no news until the next night, when the older teen\u2019s mother opened Facebook to find a message from Stephenson. The 26-year-old woman had searched Facebook as soon as she got home from work that night and discovered one of the notices about the missing teens. She messaged the girl\u2019s mother \u201cand then sat by my computer waiting for her to [respond],\u201d Stephenson said. \u201cThe minute she did, she was like, \u2018Oh my gosh, are you serious?\u2019\u201d \n \n The two continued talking by phone, and Stephenson notified local police, as well as her cousins, who are deputies in nearby Cecil County. But the police found no sign of the girls that night, and they didn\u2019t return to the restaurant Tuesday morning. \n \n Then on Tuesday afternoon, the Charles County Sheriff\u2019s Office received several calls about two young girls panhandling in front of a strip mall on Crain Highway in Waldorf, according to sheriff\u2019s spokeswoman Diane Richardson. \n \n \u201cThey appeared to be young and were asking for money,\u201d Richardson told the Bangor Daily News. \u201cIt was odd that there would be two young girls outside this clothing store holding up signs asking for money. A lot of people were actually concerned.\u201d \n \n An officer picked up the two girls and took them to a district station, where he stayed with them until a social worker picked them up at about 10 p.m. \n \n The younger girl\u2019s mother flew to Maryland to drive her car home, and the older girl\u2019s mom rented a car and left at 2 a.m. Wednesday to retrieve the girls. \n \n What she discovered, the older girl\u2019s mother said, was the girls\u2019 \u201cThelma and Louise\u201d plan. She learned that the girls had traveled south, without their phones, \u201cstraight through Boston, New York and some of the most scary places they could have been.\u201d \n \n They told sheriff\u2019s deputies that they stopped in Washington, D.C., looking for a gas station, but someone told them to \u201cget out of the city\u201d and they decided Waldorf \u201clooked like a nice place to stop and ask for money.\u201d \n \n \u201cOne of the scariest parts for me was that the social worker who found them a place to stay for the night said they were just south of Washington, D.C., and in that area [human] trafficking is huge,\u201d the older girl\u2019s mother said. \n \n The drive back to Maine was quiet at first, she said. Their first stop was the Blue Crab Grill, to see the waitress who may have saved their lives. She worried, at first, that the girls would be angry. \n \n Stephenson, who is six months pregnant with her first daughter, said she told the girls, \u201cAll I could think about was that in the future, if something were to happen with my daughter, I would want someone to get in contact with me to tell me she was all right, that she was alive and OK.\u201d \n \n Both girls eventually thanked her, Stephenson said. \n \n \u201cI said, \u2018Do you understand why that was putting a target on you? At your age?\u2019 I told them how serious it was and it seemed to dawn on them the things that could have gone wrong in that scenario.\u201d \n \n When they arrived back in Maine, the girls were grounded and the older girl, at least, is prohibited from using social media, including Facebook. \n \n But her mom, and the rest of the family, spent much of the next few days on Facebook, praising and \u201cfriending\u201d the Delaware woman who found their girl. \n \n \u201cThis is a hero,\u201d the mom wrote on Facebook. \u201cA person who trusted her gut when she saw two young girls all alone and helped. A person who spent her own time calling authorities in multiple states to let them know the girls could be headed their way and a person who let a scared mom message her for hours trying to make sense of a terrifying situation. This is a hero.\u201d \n \n Because no charges were filed against the girls, the Bangor Daily News agreed not to identify them or their families.",

Flying a plane was on it; so was running through a poppy field and breaking up a fight between two boys over her affections. She also wanted to save a life. \n \n The aspiring nurse's ambitions came to a halt in September, when she was killed by a suspected drunken driver near Chico State, where she attended school. \n \n Though Chesterman, 21, didn't get to mark much off her list, she has saved more lives than she hoped -- and is profoundly affecting many others. Five Northern Californians have been saved through Kristina's choice to donate her organs. And her grateful friends and family are making the rest of her bucket list their own. \n \n A photograph of Kristina Chesterman is displayed during a birthday party for Jayden Kirby on Sunday, Feb. 9, 2014, in Fremont, Calif.

(Courtesy of the Chesterman Family) ( Chesterman Family ) \n \n Chesterman's mother, Sandra, of Livermore, said her daughter wanted to help people from an early age. She routinely gave blood and, at age 18, registered as an organ donor, because -- as the young woman explained to her mom -- \"it's the right thing to do.\" \n \n \"I know she would've been so proud,\" Sandra Chesterman said of her daughter's legacy. \"It hasn't been an easy process for us, but at the same time, it's brought us so much comfort.\" \n \n Comfort came from the family of Jayden Kirby, of Fremont, who might have died as an infant had he not received a part of Kristina Chesterman's liver. Jayden's mother, Christine, figured out the name of the mystery donor after hearing news reports, and she connected with the Chestermans through Facebook. On Feb. 9, Sandra Chesterman, director of the Livermore Homeless Refuge, and her husband, Dave, met with the Kirbys in Fremont to celebrate Jayden's first birthday. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \"I wanted her to see the impact Kristina had,\" Christine Kirby said. \"(The transplant) absolutely saved (Jayden's) life.\" \n \n Jayden's grandmother Ana Martinez, who wears a pink bracelet honoring Kristina Chesterman, considers the young woman their \"guardian angel.\" \n \n \"I believe Kristina was here to really make an impact, and that goodness will ripple forever,\" she said. \n \n Chesterman also saved Sakariah \"Zak\" Pappachan, a Fremont resident who is overcoming renal failure thanks to her kidney. Pappachan and his wife, Angela, attended the same church as Chesterman's aunt, Patricia Picard. Immediately after Chesterman's death, Picard texted the couple, asking if Zak Pappachan was a match. Within hours, he had his new kidney. \n \n Now he is enjoying being a dad to his young daughter, RayeAnn, and is advocating for organ donation. \n \n The Pappachans, who are making a memorial to Chesterman in their backyard, have grown close to the Chesterman family since the transplant. Angela sang at Kristina's funeral, and the two families spent Christmas Eve together at church. \n \n Sandra Chesterman, left, visits with Christine Kirby, center, her son Jayden Kirby, 1, during a birthday party for Jayden on Sunday, Feb. 9, 2014, in Fremont, Calif.

No matter what I go through, I have to be thankful for Kristina.\" \n \n Three others also share Chesterman's organs. A Northern California man, 42, received her kidney and pancreas. The rest of her liver went to a San Francisco man, and her heart still beats inside an unidentified 63-year-old woman from the South Bay, whom Sandra Chesterman hopes to meet someday. \n \n For the Chestermans, the community created with the Pappachans and Kirbys has helped them deal with a nightmarish year. In February 2013, son Daniel was brutally beaten while visiting Kristina in Chico. After multiple surgeries, he still lacks feeling on the left side of his face. \n \n Daniel Chesterman's attacker will be sentenced for felony assault in early March. About the same time, a preliminary hearing begins for Riley Dean Hoover, the 19-year-old charged with felony DUI and hit-and-run in Kristina Chesterman's death. \n \n While the wheels of justice turn, Kristina Chesterman's impact continues to build. Her friends and family have taken on her bucket list, and it is inspiring even more good works. Chico State's Kristina Chesterman Memorial Nursing Scholarship has raised more than $30,000, and -- prompted by Chesterman's desire to join Doctors Without Borders -- fellow nursing students are raising money for a medical clinic to be built in her name in Nigeria. They hope to break ground this summer. \n \n Bridget Kline, of Livermore, built up the courage to go sky diving over the ocean near San Diego, knowing it would've meant a lot to Chesterman. \n \n \"It was so cool to do one of the crazy activities she never got to do,\" Kline said. \"I was terrified, but I thought about her and it was comforting. ... It was like I had a friend with me.\" \n \n Longtime Chesterman family friend and neighbor Chris Leslie brought a photo of Kristina with him on a first-class flight to Japan -- meeting her goal to fly posh -- and will do so again on an upcoming trip to Paris. \n \n \"It's not quite the same, but she'll be in first class with me,\" Leslie said. \"You wonder why someone like that is taken so young, but I believe Kristina was one of those very rare people who was so complete as a person already. ... The rest of us are just a work in progress.\" \n \n In powerful ways, though not how she would've imagined, Sandra Chesterman thinks her daughter is still fulfilling her destiny. \n \n \"I have gotten so many signs from Kristina that give me inspiration,\" she said. \"I know she's doing whatever she can to lead us in the right direction.\" \n \n Contact Jeremy Thomas at 925-847-2184.

There was an article about Kristina Chesterman, her bucket list, and how her mother hoped to meet the woman who received her heart. \n \n \u201cShe read me Kristina\u2019s bucket list,\u201d Vieira said. \u201cIt was as if I was getting a CV of my life. There were so many points that I had already accomplished on that bucket list. It was uncanny.\u201d \n \n For instance, Vieira had already ridden a camel and learned to fly a plane, she said. \n \n Sandra Chesterman and Vieira connected on social media that day and agreed to meet in person soon after.

Without any action, the cuts, worth $1.2 trillion over a decade, are scheduled to take effect March 1 and are causing deep anxiety among government workers and contractors. \n \n Obama did not outline a specific proposal, and he said he still favored a broad deal of spending cuts and tax changes \u2014 which would eliminate deductions and loopholes that benefit the wealthy and certain industries \u2014 to replace the sequester. \n \n \u201cIf Congress can\u2019t act immediately on a bigger package, if they can\u2019t get a bigger package done by the time the sequester is scheduled to go into effect,\u201d Obama said in the White House briefing room, \u201cthen I believe that they should at least pass a smaller package of spending cuts and tax reforms that would delay the economically damaging effects of the sequester for a few more months.\u201d \n \n To delay the sequester for several months, any plan passed by Congress would have to reduce borrowing by tens of billions of dollars through a combination of alternative spending cuts or tax increases. The White House said it would work with Congress on crafting the package. \n \n 1 of 10 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Five truths and five myths about the debt ceiling View Photos Post staff writer Neil Irwin lays out some facts about the debt limit, while former government official Bruce Bartlett clears up some falsehoods. Caption Post staff writer Neil Irwin lays out some facts about the debt limit, while former government official Bruce Bartlett clears up some falsehoods. TRUTH: That gap between revenue and spending? It's the deficit. Irwin writes, \"The U.S. government took in about $7,000 in revenue for every man, woman and child in the United States last year. It spent more than $11,000 per person. The gap between those numbers, about $4,000 per person, is the deficit, and it was covered by borrowing money. Some politicians speak as if high levels of government spending and a large budget deficit are the same thing. This isn\u2019t so. You could have a government that spends $11,000 per person \u2014 but with taxes to match it \u2014 and no deficit. Or you could have a bare-bones government of a libertarian\u2019s fantasy that spends only $7,000 per person but that runs a large deficit because it raises only $3,000 per person in taxes.\" Greg Kreller/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \n \n While the sequester cuts domestic and defense spending almost indiscriminately, any new package backed by the White House could find alternative savings by targeting specific programs for cuts or closing tax breaks, such as those that benefit oil and gas companies or users of corporate jets. \n \n Republicans have been warming to the idea of allowing the sequester to go forward because it guarantees sharp cuts in spending. The GOP might agree to other reductions to replace the sequester \u2014 especially since many Republicans are concerned about slashing the defense budget \u2014 but any proposal to raise taxes would likely be a flashpoint. The president has made clear he expects wealthier Americans and industries with special tax advantages to pay more toward deficit reduction. \n \n Responding to news earlier in the day that Obama would make the announcement, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said Republicans would oppose any tax increases and noted that Obama was the one who first proposed the sequester. \n \n \u201cThere is a better way to reduce the deficit, but Americans do not support sacrificing real spending cuts for more tax hikes,\u201d Boehner said in a statement. \u201cThe president\u2019s sequester should be replaced with spending cuts and reforms that will start us on the path to balancing the budget in 10 years.\u201d \n \n The sequester is not the only looming deadline. A continuing resolution funding the government expires in late March, and the government will shut down without further action by Congress. And there is another deadline to raise the federal debt limit in the summer. \n \n A report last week showed that the economy contracted in the fourth quarter of 2012, in part because of sharp reductions in defense spending and concerns about the sequester. \n \n \u201cOur economy right now is headed in the right direction. And it will stay that way, as long as there aren\u2019t any more self-inflicted wounds coming out of Washington,\u201d Obama said Tuesday. \n \n You\u2019ve heard the word \u201csequester\u201d mentioned by politicians a lot lately. The Washington Post\u2019s Ed O\u2019Keefe explains what the term means, and why it matters. (The Washington Post) \n \n Just before the president\u2019s announcement, the Congressional Budget Office released its economic projections for the year ahead. The nonpartisan CBO said that by the end of 2013, the federal budget deficit will come in under $1 trillion \u2014 the first time in five years. The gap between taxes and spending is estimated to narrow to $845 billion in the fiscal year that ends in September, the release said. \n \n Attributed in large part to tax hikes adopted on Jan. 1 and the sequester set to hit next month, the CBO\u2019s new projections show the deficit continuing its drop in 2014 and 2015, and falling to less than 3 percent of the overall economy for much of this decade. \n \n Obama\u2019s push for a short-term solution picked up Democratic support in the Senate on Tuesday. \n \n \u201cI agree with President Obama that if we can\u2019t agree now on a long-term solution, the best thing for families and the economy would be to pass a balanced short-term sequestration replacement while the House and Senate work on our budget resolutions,\" said Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), chairwoman of the Senate Budget Committee. \n \n The sequester was a mechanism that Congress and the White House designed in 2011 to force policymakers to generate significant deficit reduction over the next 10 years. \n \n While they have made progress on that front \u2014 gaining more than $2.5 trillion in deficit savings \u2014 they have not come to a broad agreement as many hoped. \n \n The sequester would slice $1.2 trillion in domestic and defense spending over 10 years, indiscriminately cutting most programs. (Some programs, such as Medicaid and food stamps, are exempt.) \n \n The \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d deal at the start of the year postponed the sequester for two months. \n \n Obama favors a broader plan to permanently end the sequester and replace it with a series of reductions in health care and other mandatory spending as well as the elimination of tax breaks that benefit the wealthy and industries. He said on Tuesday his offer to Boehner from December, reflecting these principles, is still on the table. \n \n Republicans favor deep cuts to spending without raising taxes any more. ||||| Speaker John Boehner is signaling he will not accept revenue increases that President Barack Obama is expected to propose to delay the automatic spending cuts that take hold at the beginning of March. \n \n \u201cPresident Obama first proposed the sequester and insisted it become law,\u201d Boehner said in a statement. \u201cRepublicans have twice voted to replace these arbitrary cuts with common-sense cuts and reforms that protect our national defense. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n (Also on POLITICO: What is sequestration?) \n \n \u201cWe believe there is a better way to reduce the deficit, but Americans do not support sacrificing real spending cuts for more tax hikes,\u201d he added. \u201cThe president\u2019s sequester should be replaced with spending cuts and reforms that will start us on the path to balancing the budget in 10 years.\u201d \n \n Boehner \u2014 and House Republicans, broadly \u2014 have been opposed to delaying the sequester.

In an address this afternoon, Obama called for a handful of small budget cuts to justify pushing the automatic spending cuts back again, this time until after Congress has crafted a new federal budget, the Washington Post reports. The extra time could be used, Obama said, to come up with a \"balanced\" long-term deficit fix. \"There is no reason that the jobs of thousands of Americans \u2026 not to mention the growth of the entire economy should be put in jeopardy just because a few folks in Washington couldn't agree to eliminate a few special interest tax loopholes,\" he said.

    "document": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Turing Pharmaceuticals boss Martin Shkreli had previously defended the price riise \n \n Judging by social media, Martin Shkreli, the 32-year-old chief executive of Turing Pharmaceuticals, may be the most hated man in America right now. \n \n He's been called a \"morally bankrupt sociopath\", a \"scumbag\" a \"garbage monster\" and \"everything that is wrong with capitalism.\" And those are some of the tamer comments. \n \n So how did a rap music-loving, former hedge fund manager suddenly become the target of online ridicule and even death threats? \n \n His company recently acquired the rights to Daraprim. Developed in the 1950s, the drug is the best treatment for a relatively rare parasitic infection called toxoplasmosis. People with weakened immune systems, such as Aids patients, have come to rely on the drug, which until recently cost about $13.50 (\u00a38.80) a dose. \n \n But Mr Shkreli announced he was raising the price to $750 a pill. The more than 5,000% increase and his brash defence of the decision has made him a pariah among patients-rights groups, politicians and hundreds of Twitter users. \n \n Other drugs companies have made similar moves raising the price of niche products, but few have so publicly and so unapologetically answered critics. \n \n The backlash became so pitched on Tuesday that Mr Shkreli agreed to lower the price of Daraprim to an \"affordable level\". \n \n Image copyright Twitter Image caption Martin Shkreli, seen here in an August Twitter post, has aggressively answered critics \n \n Humble beginnings \n \n Martin Shkreli, the son of Albanian and Croatian immigrants, grew up in a working-class community in Brooklyn, New York. He skipped several grades in school and received a degree in business from New York's Baruch College in 2004. \n \n At 17, he began his first internship at Cramer Berkowitz & Co, the hedge fund founded by television personality Jim Cramer. \n \n In 2006, Mr Shkreli started his own hedge fund, Elea Capital Management. \n \n The fund closed a year later after a $2.3m lawsuit from Lehman Brothers, which collapsed before it could collect on the ruling. \n \n After Elea, Mr Shkreli started MSMB Capital Management in 2008. The fund would be his launch pad for founding biotech firms including Turing. \n \n Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Shkreli moved into the pharmaceutical industry after working as a hedge fund manager \n \n A rocky start in pharmaceuticals \n \n Turing was not Mr Shkreli's first foray into the pharmaceutical industry. In 2011, he founded biotech firm Retrophin, with the goal of focusing on medicines for rare diseases. \n \n He was ousted as head of the company in 2014 amidst allegations he improperly handled legal settlements. \n \n A year later the company filed a $65m lawsuit that claimed Mr Shkreli created Retrophin and took it public simply to pay off investors in his old hedge fund, MSMB when the fund went under. \n \n Mr Shkreli has denied the accusations. \"They are sort of concocting this wild and crazy and unlikely story to swindle me out of the money,\" he told the New York Times. \n \n On August 4, 2017, a jury found Mr Shkreli guilty of three of eight counts, including securities fraud, in a criminal case brought by US prosecutors. But they cleared him of allegations that he had looted Retrophin to make payments for the hedge funds. The civil suit brought by Retrophin remained pending as of 4 August. \n \n Image caption Turing Pharmaceuticals bought the rights to Daraprim in August \n \n A second chance \n \n Turing Pharmaceuticals was launched in February 2015 after Mr Shkreli was forced out of Retrophin. \n \n The business claims its goal is to focus on treatments for serious diseases for which there are limited options. \"We are dedicated to helping patients, who often have no effective treatment options,\" a statement on Turing's website said. \n \n The company only has two products on the market Daraprim and Vecamyl, which treats hypertension. \n \n Mr Shkreli has argued the Daraprim price increase was warranted because the drug is highly specialised; he likened the Daraprim to an Aston Martin previously being sold at the price of a bicycle. The additional profits he said will be used to make improvements to the 62-year-old drug recipe. \n \n Image copyright Twitter Image caption One of Shkreli's first tweets about the Dramaprim controversy \n \n Mr Shkreli did not take the criticism of his company's actions lightly. \n \n On Sunday, he sent out a hostile tweet accusing the media of singling him out. \"And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me. So I point one back at em, but not the index or pinkie,\" he wrote, quoting an Eminem song. \n \n His tone later softened following several TV interviews where he claimed the profits of the drug would be used to create a better product. \n \n All of the negative attention may have finally had an effect on Mr Shkreli. \n \n His Twitter account, which had sparred with critics for days, went dark and then Mr Shkreli agreed to lower the price. \n \n \"We've agreed to lower the price on Daraprim to a point that is more affordable and is able to allow the company to make a profit, but a very small profit,\" he told ABC News. \"We think these changes will be welcomed.\" ||||| America is outraged \u2014 outraged! \u2014 that Turing Pharmaceuticals hiked the cost of a drug called Daraprim by 5,000% last month. (The drug is used to fight infections in patients suffering from AIDS and other conditions.) \n \n What took everyone so long? \n \n Turing CEO Martin Shkreli is a repeat moral offender. He pulled off similar price hikes at his previous company, before getting fired and sued for $65 million. \n \n But there's a much bigger problem than Shkreli here: The skyrocketing cost of generic drugs. It's nothing new. And it hadn't gotten much attention until this week, partly because most pharma companies aren't run by evil executives who happily explain they're making a profit by over-charging AIDS patients. \n \n Here's an incredible sentence from an ABC News report from this past May \u2014 on three other generic drugs that have seen their prices skyrocket in the past year. \n \n The cost of the generic blood pressure medication captopril jumped more than 2,700 percent, the asthma drug albuterol sulfate went up more than 3,400 percent and the antibiotic doxycycline jumped a whopping 6,300 percent, according to National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) statistics. \n \n One 49-year-old patient suffering from a painful condition called endometriosis said the cost of her treatment had grown 6,500% between 2010 and 2015. She now spends about $115 per day on a generic painkiller called fentanyl citrate, which is forcing her to deplete her retirement savings. \n \n \"I realized if I wanted to keep my job and my life, I was going to have to find a way to pay for this,\" she told ABC News. \"I started taking money out of my IRA, and that\u2019s how we had to pay for it.\" \n \n There's a mix of reasons for these soaring prices, but the most important factor is that companies like Turing are cornering the market on certain generic drugs, and then using their near-monopoly power to hike prices. \n \n So why doesn't another firm try and compete, especially given that the patent on a drug like Daraprim has lapsed? Well, maybe 10,000 people use Daraprim every year. And as Sarah Kliff wisely reports for Vox, there isn't enough market demand for these generic drugs to motivate a new competitor to enter the field. \n \n And given the relatively small numbers of people affected by each of these drug hikes, there hasn't been much attention on the issue \u2014 even though the National Community Pharmacists Association has flagged dozens of generic drugs that have seen their costs similarly skyrocket in the past year. \n \n The Daraprim scandal exploded this week for several reasons. An odious pharma executive straight out of central casting. Hillary Clinton's speech, further calling attention to the problem. And \u2014 by Google News' count \u2014 more than 3,600 articles dedicated to the controversy. \n \n But the Daraprim scandal is now over. Two days after the story detonated in the pages of the New York Times, Turing Pharmaceuticals will dramatically reduce its planned price hike to Daraprim, Shkreli told NBC News on Tuesday night. He didn't make clear what the new price would be, only that it would be lowered to a level for Turing to make a \"small profit.\" \n \n The real trick wasn't getting Turing Pharmaceuticals to back down. The sheer weight of the news cycle did that this week. \n \n (By Tuesday morning, the news about Turing and Shkreli was even trending around the world. \"\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 este hombre es el m\u00e1s odiado de internet?\" asked writers at Sopitas.com, a Mexican website.) \n \n The hard part is achieving lasting reform. And no one agrees on how to do that. \n \n Take Hillary Clinton's new proposal to reform the prescription drug industry, which was hailed by her supporters but panned by some policy experts. \n \n Harvard's Amitabh Chandra tells the New York Times that Clinton's proposal to force pharma companies to reinvest profits into R&D is \"astonishingly na\u00efve\"; there's no evidence that pharma firms aren't doing enough research, and pushing them to spend more upfront would seem to do little to lower the actual costs of drugs. Meanwhile at Forbes, Avik Roy contends that Clinton's plan would actually lower the incentive for new companies to enter the market, by reducing the patent life on innovative drugs. \n \n Instead, the most promising solution is probably pushing on regulators, not singling out pharma companies. Writing in the NEJM last year, Jonathan Alpern and coauthors suggested that FDA needed to dramatically speed up its process to encourage new generic manufacturers; the agency on average needs 10 months just to process a new application to produce a drug. \n \n \"[W]e believe that special pathways should be created to promote competition and permit the private market to function more efficiently,\" Alpern and his coauthors wrote. \n \n Getting FDA to change its regulations is a slow process. There won't be any TV-ready villains; just rounds of public comment and dry testimony. And the rules won't be fixed by a few days of negative headlines. \n \n But if you care about this issue \u2014 if you're offended by what Turing tried to do to Daraprim \u2014 remember your outrage. Keep it close. You'll need it for the long slog to come in the months ahead. \n \n -- \n \n Follow @ddiamond \n \n Sign up for Dan's free newsletter. \n \n From the archives: \n \n Also on Forbes:",

    "document": "ATHENS \u2014 Parliament appeared close to approving and carrying out a set of unpopular austerity measures after a day of intense political maneuvering on Tuesday that seemed to bring wavering members of the ruling Socialist Party into line. \n \n While the lawmakers debated, riot police clashed with protesters outside the Parliament building. Parliament must pass the measures \u2014 which include wage cuts, tax increases and privatizations in a recession-starved country \u2014 before Greece\u2019s foreign lenders unlock the next installment of aid that the country needs to avoid default. \n \n Prime Minister George A. Papandreou has a five-vote parliamentary majority as he tries to push through the austerity plan, which strikes at the heart of his Socialist Party base. The center-right New Democracy opposition party has struck a populist tone and opposes the measures, saying they offer too much austerity and not enough stimulus. \n \n In the tense countdown ahead of the vote to approve the austerity package, which is scheduled for Wednesday, at least one member of Parliament from the Socialist Party who had opposed the bill changed his mind. \n \n The lawmaker, Thomas Robopoulos, told state television on Tuesday that he would support the measures, \u201cputting the national interest above everything else.\u201d Earlier, Mr. Robopoulos had said he would decide \u201cat the very last moment, after I have listened to all the speakers,\u201d referring to the debate in Parliament. \n \n \u201cThis is a crucial moment; if the memorandum does not pass we shall go bankrupt,\u201d Mr. Robopoulos added. \n \n He spoke after talks with the new finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, a longtime Socialist who is regarded as being able to rally the party behind the measures, however unpopular. \n \n The nation\u2019s unions complicated matters on Tuesday when they began a 48-hour general strike \u2014 the first time they had walked out for more than 24 hours since democracy was restored to Greece in 1974 after a seven-year military dictatorship. \n \n The protests in Syntagma Square in front of Parliament began peacefully but turned violent as groups of youths on the fringes began throwing rocks, firebombs and firecrackers. \n \n The European Union, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund have said they will release $17 billion that Greece needs to pay its expenses through the summer if Parliament passes the measures. \n \n \u201cThe only way to avoid immediate default is for Parliament to endorse the revised economic program,\u201d said Olli Rehn, the European Union\u2019s top economic and monetary affairs official. \u201cLet me say this clearly: There is no Plan B to avoid default.\u201d \n \n In Brussels, European Union officials said they were working on contingency plans, including an effort to persuade the Greek opposition leader Antonis Samaras of the New Democracy Party to support the measures. \n \n After the vote on the austerity measures, Parliament is scheduled on Thursday to consider a bill on how each of the measures will be carried out. Last year, Greece\u2019s foreign lenders imposed austerity measures after they provided a first round of aid. \n \n Since then, Greece has cut the wages of its 800,000 public workers \u2014 a quarter of the work force \u2014 by more than 10 percent. \n \n The demonstration on Tuesday was one of the first in which labor unions joined with the younger demonstrators who have gathered in downtown Athens every night for the past month. Security forces fired tear gas to thin out the crowd, sending the demonstrators fleeing into side streets. \n \n A police official said that 23 people were detained, with five later arrested, and that 21 officers were injured, none seriously. \n \n Near Syntagma Square, a 40-year-old woman who gave her name only as Eirini, said she had been a secretary in a construction firm but had been out of work for more than five months. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m here because we have nothing to lose,\u201d she said, pushing down the surgical mask she used to filter out the tear gas. \u201cWe know very well that in six months, when they run out of money in the banks, we will be even more broke and hungry.\u201d \n \n She added, \u201cI think that in one year, we are going to go to Syntagma, take out all the grass and plant tomatoes.\u201d ||||| Riot police fired tear gas at youths hurling rocks near the Greek finance ministry Tuesday, trying to quell the anger unleashed by a general strike as parliament debated new cost-cutting measures. \n \n A demonstrator kicks a tear gas canister against police during a demo in Athens on Tuesday June 28, 2011.

(Associated Press) \n \n The latest austerity measures must pass in two parliamentary votes Wednesday and Thursday if Greece is to receive bailout funds from the EU and the IMF that will keep it from becoming the first eurozone nation to default on its debts. \n \n The clashes with police came at the start of a two-day general strike called by unions furious that the government's new euro28 billion ($40 billion) austerity program will slap taxes on minimum wage earners and other struggling Greeks. The measures come on top of other spending cuts and tax hikes that have sent the Greek unemployment rate soaring to over 16 percent. \n \n Hooded youths ripped up paving stones and set trash bins on fire in central Athens as police gave chase and fired tear gas and stun grenades. Earlier, about 20,000 people had marched peacefully in two separate demonstrations, while another 7,000 protested in the northern city of Thessaloniki without incident. \n \n Everyone from doctors and ambulance drivers to casino workers and even actors at a state-funded theater were joining the strike or holding work stoppages for several hours. \n \n Hundreds of flights were canceled or rescheduled as air traffic controllers walked off the job for four hours in the morning _ and were holding another walkout in the evening. Strikes by public transport workers snarled traffic across the capital, while other protesters blockaded the port of Piraeus. \n \n \"The situation that the workers are undergoing is tragic and we are near poverty levels,\" said Spyros Linardopoulos, a protester with the PAME union at the Piraeus blockade. \"The government has declared war and to this war we will answer back with war.\" \n \n Lawmakers began debating the latest austerity measures Monday and were continuing Tuesday. The package and an additional implementation law must be passed so the European Union and the International Monetary Fund release the next installment of Greece's euro110 billion ($156 billion) bailout loan. \n \n Without that euro12 billion ($17 billion) installment, Greece faces the prospect of a default next month _ a potentially disastrous event that could drag down European banks, hurt other financially troubled European countries and even shock the whole global financial system. \n \n But even lawmakers from the governing Socialists have been upset over the latest measures demanded by international creditors, and Prime Minister George Papandreou has struggled to contain an internal party revolt. He reshuffled his cabinet earlier this month to try to ensure his party's support for this vote, but the Socialists still only have a 5-seat majority in the 300-member Parliament. \n \n Papandreou urged lawmakers Monday to fulfill a \"patriotic duty\" by voting in favor of the new measures, but two of his own lawmakers have suggested they won't. \n \n European officials have also been pressuring Greece's the main conservative opposition party to back the austerity bill. \n \n \"Both the future of the country and financial stability in Europe are at stake,\" European Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said. \"I fully respect the prerogatives and the sovereignty of the Greek Parliament in the ongoing debate. And I trust that the Greek political leaders are fully aware of the responsibility that lies on their shoulders to avoid default.\" \n \n But conservative party leader Antonis Samaras has refused, arguing that while he backs some austerity measures, the overall thinking behind the package is flawed. \n \n Greece remains frozen out of bond markets and is surviving on the euro110 billion ($156 billion) in promised bailout loans. But the initial plan had assumed that Greece would be able to return to the markets next year. \n \n That won't happen, and a result Athens is negotiating for a second bailout, which Papandreou has said will be roughly the same size as the first. \n \n Papandreou said he hoped the terms would be better than those for the first bailout. \n \n \"I call on Europe, for its part, to give Greece the time and the terms it needs to really pay off its debt, without strangling growth, and without strangling its citizens,\" he said. \n \n Papandreou's new finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, said the government acknowledged the new cuts were \"unfair\" and that he hoped negotiations over a second bailout would be concluded by the end of the summer. \n \n \"These measures will take us from running budget deficits to achieving primary surpluses,\" he said. \"It's a difficult but necessary step.\" \n \n But many Greeks insist they should not be forced to pay for a crisis they believe the politicians are responsible for. \n \n \"We don't owe any money, it's the others who stole it,\" said 69-year-old demonstrator Antonis Vrahas. \"We're resisting for a better society for the sake of our children and grandchildren.\" \n \n Even with the new austerity measures, many investors still believe that Greece is heading for some sort of default because its overall debt burden is too great. \n \n ___ \n \n Demetris Nellas in Athens contributed.",

Cartels have taken to displaying their victims in public as a means of intimidating local authorities and the media.Authorities say Edgar's teenage sisters were accomplices in the killings, often acting as decoys to lure victims.

The AP quoted a source as saying that one of the sisters was accused of disposing of victims' bodies by dumping them on streets.It is not clear what the nickname \"El Ponchis\" refers to. ||||| In cargo pants and a T-shirt, the skinny, American-born 14-year-old looked like he should be in middle school. Instead he was surrounded by three armed Mexican soldiers in ski masks and camouflage as he told reporters that he helped a Mexican drug gang behead four people. \n \n Mexican army soldiers escort a 14-year-old suspected of working as a killer for a drug cartel in the city of Cuernavaca, Mexico, Friday Dec. 3, 2010. The much-rumored alleged young assassin nicknamed... (Associated Press) \n \n Mexican officials say they arrested the youth known as \"El Ponchis\" late Thursday at an airport south of Mexico City with a 19-year-old sister who is accused of helping him dump the bodies. Authorities said he was caught with two cell phones that held photographs of tortured victims. \n \n Many youths have been used by drug cartels in their bloody battles against the government and each other, but the story of El Ponchis may be the most shocking. A YouTube video that emerged a month ago sparked talk of a child hit man _ said by some to be as young as 12. \n \n \"I participated in four executions, but I did it drugged and under threat that if I didn't, they would kill me,\" the boy said calmly when he was handed over to the federal prosecutor Friday morning, showing no remorse. \n \n Authorities identified the curly-haired suspect by his first name only _ Edgar. \n \n He told reporters early Friday he was kidnapped at the age of 11 and forced to work for the Cartel of the South Pacific, a branch of the splintered Beltran Leyva gang, and that he had participated in at least four decapitations. \n \n Authorities said the siblings were detained at an airport near Cuernavaca in Morelos state with paid tickets to flee the country. \n \n Morelos Gov. Marco Adame Castillo said the boy was born in San Diego, California, and Mexican officials were researching whether he has dual nationality. A U.S. Embassy official who spoke on condition of anonymity due to embassy policy said American officials had not yet confirmed his citizenship. \n \n The boy's sister said they were headed for Tijuana, where they planned to cross the border and seek refuge with their stepmother in San Diego. Their mother sent them money for the tickets, she said, but it was not clear where their parents are. \n \n The army did not say whether the children had passed security when they were detained. Neither has been formally charged. \n \n The two allegedly worked for Julio \"El Negro\" Padilla, who has been fighting for control of the drug trade in Morelos, formerly part of the territory under the Beltran Leyva gang, which broke up with the killing of leader Arturo Beltran Leyva by Mexican marines a year ago. The battle among remnants of the gang has caused an unprecedented spike in violence in Morelos and in neighboring Guerrero state, where the resort city of Acapulco is located. \n \n El Ponchis' sister said she was the girlfriend of Padilla and part of a group of girls called Las Chabelas, who helped dump bodies on streets and freeways in and around Cuernavaca, a city about 56 miles (90 kilometers) south of Mexico City. She said her brother introduced them. \n \n An adult sister picked up at the airport appeared with the two Friday, but authorities said she has no ties to drug trafficking. \n \n Stories of a hit boy, maybe as young as 12, spread after a YouTube video appeared last month with teens mugging for the camera next to corpses and guns. One boy on the video alleged that \"El Ponchis\" was his accomplice. State and federal authorities refused to confirm El Ponchis even existed. \n \n In the video, the youth told an unseen questioner that his gang was paid $3,000 per killing. \n \n \"When we don't find the rivals, we kill innocent people, maybe a construction worker or a taxi driver,\" the youth is heard saying. \n \n Figures obtained by The Associated Press from Mexico's attorney general's office show that the number of youths 18 and under detained for drug-related crimes has climbed steadily since President Felipe Calderon launched his assault on cartels in 2006. There were 482 that year and 810 in 2009. There were 562 in the first eight months of this year, on track to surpass last year. \n \n Calderon has acknowledged that \"in the most violent areas of the country, there is an unending recruitment of young people without hope, without opportunities.\" \n \n The federal government has said the cartels are recruiting ever younger assassins to replace those killed or arrested in the current wars among the gangs and with the government. The government also has said that cartels prefer underage youths because they shorter sentences if caught. \n \n Unlike the United States, Mexico has no system for trying juveniles as adults, though a bill that would establish such a provision is before the Mexican Senate. In Mexico, juveniles are sentenced to youth detention centers and are freed at age 18. \n \n Although state courts handle crimes by juveniles in Mexico, authorities in Morelos have asked Mexico's federal government to take over the case because of the gravity of the crimes. \n \n Neighbors said the siblings were living in a cartel safehouse in a poor neighborhood of Jiutepec, a working-class suburb of Cuernavaca. The area has an industrial area with Nissan, Unilever and other factories, rustic single-level concrete homes and some farms. \n \n ________ \n \n Associated Press Writer Mark Stevenson contributed to this report from Cancun.",

Her car was later found in a parking lot at Sapphire Beach, where locals often go to swim, and her sandals, sarong and dress were found on the beach, her colleagues tell Newsweek. \n \n Upp has a rare form of amnesia called dissociative fugue\u2014best known as the medical condition that affected the character Jason Bourne\u2014which can cause people to forget who they are for days or months at a time. \n \n The 32-year-old went missing in similar circumstances twice before. Upp went for a run in Manhattan in 2008 and disappeared for almost three weeks before she was found floating in the water off the southern point of the island, with no memory of the preceding weeks. She disappeared again for about two days in 2013 in Maryland, again telling police after she was found that she had no memory of where she had been or what she had done while she was missing. Facebook, courtesy Maggie Guzman \n \n Her latest disappearance is especially troubling because it comes while St. Thomas rebuilds from Hurricane Irma and as residents sheltered from Hurricane Maria late Tuesday and early Wednesday. \n \n \u201cLast night we had six hours of heavy, heavy rain and winds, so I\u2019m worried that she was hiding out somewhere that wasn\u2019t safe,\u201d Maggie Guzman, a friend and fellow teacher, tells Newsweek. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things to worry about. But my hope is that she found somewhere safe to hide.\u201d \n \n The search for Upp has been complicated and slowed by the hurricane and by poor cellphone service on the island.

Guzman called Upp\u2019s roommates and friends but nobody had seen her, and Upp didn\u2019t answer her phone. \n \n \u201cShe may be confused and disoriented or not know who she is.

Guzman later posted a rumor that Upp was sighted at a bar called Rum Hut\u2014wearing a dirty tank top and a bandage on her arm\u2014in an attempt to find out whether anyone else had seen her there. (Another resident posted that the woman in the tank top was a friend and not Upp.) \n \n Upp called her mother Tuesday after a staff meeting at Virgin Islands Montessori School and said she was safe and planned to stay on the island. \u201cAccording to her mother, she sounded coherent,\u201d Bornn, the head of school, tells Newsweek, adding that Thursday morning she left a note for friends saying she was going for a swim at Sapphire Beach and would then go to school. Photo courtesy Beverly Millard \n \n \u201cTo me, that was the last conscious act that we know of,\u201d says Bornn, adding that Upp\u2019s colleagues and friends have hung paper fliers around the island and have checked the hospital and shelters. \n \n Hurricane Irma hit St. Thomas last week and devastated the U.S. territory of about 50,000 people, tearing the roof off the hospital, destroying many buildings and killing at least four people. \n \n Stressful situations can trigger the symptoms of dissociative amnesia, which include \u201cdifficulty remembering important information about one\u2019s self,\u201d and can last from minutes to years, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Facebook, Courtesy Maggie Guzman \n \n When Upp was missing in 2008, police reports said she spent a lot of time in places like Riverside Drive, which overlooks the Hudson River, according to The New York Times. After she was found, she said her attraction to the area made sense\u2014an answer that may also shed light on why she found her way to Sapphire Beach almost 10 years later. \u201cNot only is it one of my favorite places, but there\u2019s something soothing about the sound of water and just not feeling trapped in the concrete jungle,\u201d she told the newspaper in 2009. \n \n Upp\u2019s friends worry she drowned at Sapphire Beach, was the victim of a crime or was once again struck by amnesia and is now wandering around the island, confused and hiding.

Two men were down, but the Cardinals had the bases loaded for Yadier Molina.

The woman, Yaneisi Fernandez, said she has never seen Menendez before, not even on television. \n \n (PHOTOS: Top congressional scandals) \n \n \n \n \"I\u2019ve never been to Casa de Campo, I\u2019ve never participated in those activities, don\u2019t know those people or that man,\" Fernandez said, according to a translation provided by Univision. \n \n \n \n Menendez came under fire last week when the office of Dr. Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye doctor with ties to the senator, was raided by the FBI. It was later learned that in January Menendez reimbursed Melgen for flights on his private jet to the Dominican Republic. \n \n In reports first published by the Daily Caller, Menendez was accused of patronizing prostitutes -- some underage -- while with Melgen at his private estate in an area known as Casa de Campo in the Dominican Republican. Fernandez 's mother told Univision that she is a college student and any suggestion her daughter was involved with the senator is a misunderstanding. \n \n Menendez has denied all of the allegations. \n \n Media outlets have been searching for the women who were identified as prostitutes in records released by the government watchdog group CREW. Fernandez was identified in those records. ||||| In a state with a colorful history, it takes a lot for a New Jersey politician to cross the line into political toxicity. \n \n Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez has found himself at the center of a growing controversy, with accusations swirling of a questionable friendship with a Florida eye surgeon being investigated for Medicare fraud, improper flights to the Dominican Republic and alleged patronizing of prostitutes \u2014 including underage girls \u2014 while in the Caribbean nation. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n In some states, these allegations \u2014 and the fact the Senate Ethics Committee has joined federal investigators in looking into the explosive claims \u2014 would be enough to sink Menendez. But in New Jersey, that may not be enough to topple the Hudson County political boss, who runs the political machine for a part of Jersey known for being rough and tumble and who easily won reelection last year. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Reid: 'Confidence' in Menendez) \n \n \u201cSix years is a long time,\u201d said Democratic former Sen. Robert Torricelli , who left the Senate a decade ago under his own ethics cloud. \u201cI think Bob Menendez is a very tenacious person, and he has the advantage of six long years and a fairly forgiving political environment in New Jersey. \n \n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be wasting time on a Bob Menendez political obituary,\u201d he added. \n \n The prostitution allegations surrounding Menendez partially came to light before last November\u2019s election, when he won with 58 percent of the vote. Menendez has fervently denied the allegations, and the Justice Department wasn\u2019t publicly investigating the case at that time. \n \n Otherwise, Menendez has had a few good months: He was pictured with President Barack Obama and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as they toured the Jersey Shore after Hurricane Sandy; helped push through the Sandy relief spending package; and took over as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Sen. John Kerry left to become secretary of state. \n \n He\u2019s also the lead Democratic Hispanic voice on immigration reform in the Senate. \n \n Top Senate Democrats, including Majority Leader Harry Reid, are backing Menendez. \n \n \u201cHe was a leader in the House. He\u2019s been a leader in the Senate. He\u2019s chairman of that committee. He\u2019ll do a wonderful job. And he\u2019s also an integral part of what we do with immigration reform. So I have the utmost confidence in him,\u201d Reid said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. \n \n \u201cI have confidence he did nothing wrong, but that\u2019s what investigations are all about,\u201d Reid added. \n \n (PHOTOS: Top congressional scandals) \n \n Senior Democratic aides said that with Ethics Committee investigating the matter, party leaders like Reid have cover not to take any action against Menendez until that panel completes its review of the case. The Ethics Committee would step out of the way if Menendez becomes formally involved in a criminal probe by the Justice Department. \n \n Menendez\u2019s aides would not comment on whether the senator has hired a defense attorney at this time or will set up a legal defense fund to help cover the costs of any ethics or criminal investigation. Marc Elias, a well-known Democratic lawyer, is advising Menendez on ethics issues but is not involved in the broader criminal case, multiple sources said. \n \n Menendez, who divorced his wife in 2005 and is still single, isn\u2019t personally wealthy. He last week repaid the company of the Florida eye surgeon, Salomon Melgen, $58,500 to cover the cost of two 2010 flights that the senator now acknowledges were personal jaunts to the Dominican Republic. \n \n Meanwhile, The New York Times reported that Menendez intervened with state and Commerce Department officials on behalf of a Melgen-owned company trying to enforce a lucrative port-security contract with the Dominican government.",

In an instant the blades went down and a flurry of feathers, bones and small beaks went flying into the air. \n \n The three bolted out the door; first Gontchar, then Kai, then Jentzsch. \n \n \"What are you doing?\" Jentzsch remembers screaming, as Kai and Gontchar became more and more hysterical. \"These are our friends.

Four ducklings managed to get away, hobbling with their mother into the lake, but two drowned. Out of the 11 ducklings, only two survived, according to the report. \n \n \"What are you doing to my ducks?\" Kai wailed, his father remembers. \"Why are you laughing?\" \n \n The boy, in tears, ran from the backyard and back into his house.

Abrams has gathered an eclectic group of actors for the franchise's future. \n \n \"They have a good group of people who have a mix of demonstrated talent and fresh resumes. (These are) people who can fill into any role they need to and who won't be recognized for something they've done that will take audiences out of the movie,\" says Eric Geller of the Star Wars fan site TheForce.net. \n \n But fans were also excited when Lucas put a talented group including Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman and Ewan McGregor together for 1999's first Star Wars prequel, the much-maligned The Phantom Menace, reminds Mike Ryan, senior editor for Screencrush.com. \n \n The big difference with the new crew? \"Han Solo is sitting right there with them,\" Ryan says. \n \n Ford, Fisher and Hamill have been rumored for months to reprise their roles as Han Solo, Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker \u2014 arguably the most famous sci-fi trio in history. \n \n That wasn't good enough for Abrams, though. He also signed on stalwarts such as Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker to play droids C-3PO and R2-D2, plus Peter Mayhew as Han's Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca. \n \n One notable snub, though, is Billy Dee Williams, notes Geller, who expected Williams to return as Cloud City huckster-turned-hero Lando Calrissian. \n \n While Williams might still have a cameo, \"Abrams has to make a movie that features Han, Luke and Leia, while handing the movie off to the newcomers,\" Ryan adds. \"Perhaps there just wasn't enough room for Lando.\" \n \n The returning six actors are fan favorites yet are getting up in age \u2014 Ford is 71, Hamill 62, Fisher 57 \u2014 and this is most likely Abrams' way to send them off in style while also passing the torch to a younger generation of potential icons. \n \n Like Lucas with his original Star Wars in 1977, Abrams balanced slim resumes with vaunted ones to fill out his cast. And while no characters, good or bad, Jedi or Sith, have been assigned to any of the actors, Abrams cast a trio of youngsters much like Lucas' core three. \n \n When they joined the first Star Wars, Ford was a veteran of TV roles and had a credit in Lucas' American Graffiti in 1973; Fisher boasted of a supporting role in Shampoo and a TV movie with her mom Debbie Reynolds; and Hamill hadn't even been seen on a big screen. \n \n Similarly, Episode VII cast members John Boyega, Domhnall Gleeson and Daisy Ridley are all relative unknowns in the U.S. Boyega starred in the cult British alien-invasion flick Attack the Block and is \"an excellent choice,\" Ryan says; Gleeson is the son of Irish actor Brendan Gleeson and had roles in the last two Harry Potter films; and Ridley's first big-screen credit is for a yet-to-be-released movie from last year, according to the TV/movie database IMDb. \n \n \"This is going to make her career,\" Geller says of Ridley, whom he guesses may play Han Solo's daughter. \"If that's the case, I think it's a great choice to pick someone in her position.\" \n \n Driver and Oscar Isaac may be more familiar to audiences. Isaac had a breakout role as a folk musician in last year's Coen brothers movie Inside Llewyn Davis, while Driver is famous for Girls. \n \n Meanwhile, Abrams adds some geek royalty in Serkis and von Sydow. \n \n Fans are probably wondering if Serkis will be seen as himself or whether he'll don the motion-capture suit for which he's become famous. He's helped bring life to the creepy, computer-generated Gollum in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit movies, as well as Caesar the ape in Rise of the Planet of the Apes and July's sequel Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. \n \n Lucas brought in Hollywood thespians in Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing for that first Star Wars movie, and 85-year-old von Sydow fills that role in Episode VII and is famous for his role in 1980's Flash Gordon. \n \n \"It's funny that Lucas originally wanted the Flash Gordon rights, couldn't get them, then made Star Wars instead,\" Ryan says. \"Now, Star Wars has Ming the Merciless. \n \n Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Shannon Rae Green reveals what Star Wars fans are saying on social media about the cast list for Episode VII.

(Photo: Lucasfilm) \n \n Star Wars Episode VII officially has a name to go with that number. \n \n The movie will be called Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Disney announced Thursday. In a post on the official Star Wars Facebook page, they unveiled the title and revealed that the movie has finished its principal photography. \n \n Although there has been plenty of speculation about the film's plot, very few official details have been released. Fans will look for any clues they might be able to discern from this announcement. The title, like the film's casting, calls on both the old and new parts of the franchise. The \"force\" is, of course, the element that the Jedi knights in the films derive their power from, introduced in the very first Star Wars movie. The fact that it's \"awakening\" could refer to the new characters the film will introduce. \n \n Star Wars: The Force Awakens will hit theaters on Dec. 18, 2015. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1qrJGD9 ||||| See more of Star Wars on Facebook ||||| If you feel a disturbance in the Force, it\u2019s millions of voices suddenly crying out the new title of Star Wars: Episode VII \u2014 The Force Awakens. \n \n The reveal comes as the movie finishes its final day of shooting (with many more months of post-production to come). \n \n Now the heavy-duty fans will weigh in, and their judgment tends to be far less forgiving than The Emperor or Darth Vader. The one thing we can all agree on is it beats the hell out of The Phantom Menace, and although it strikes a little close to the vanilla side, it may be reassuring to some who are glad the new trilogy is going tried-and-true rather than skewing campy, vague, or avant-garde. \n \n It does raise one question: Has the Force been \u2026 slumbering? We certainly saw it help Luke Skywalker launch those proton torpedoes into the thermal exhaust port of the original Death Star, and as \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic sang in his immortal Kinks spoof Yoda \u201cI picked up a box / I lifted some rocks / While I stood on my head.\u201d The Force was certainly at work there, right. And the Dark Side was getting a workout helping Darth Vader crush windpipes of the people who disappointed him. \n \n But remember Han Solo dismissing talk of the Force with \u201cHokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.\u201d Maybe this energy that binds the galaxy together has only been visible to a select few, while the denizens of the galaxy put their faith in the science and technology of interstellar travel? \n \n Whatever the case, the Force is hitting the snooze button for now. We won\u2019t know the full story until 13 months from now. \n \n The cast and crew of the J.J. Abrams film already celebrated their wrap party last weekend, although sources told EW there were still a few days left before the cameras at Pinewood Studios outside London. The shoot \u2014 spanning from the deserts of Abu Dhabi to the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, England \u2014 was anything but smooth, having been thrown into crisis after Han Solo himself, Harrison Ford, broke his leg on set in an accident involving a falling door on the Millennium Falcon. \n \n The set was also plagued by spoiler leaks \u2014 or was it? The flow of rumors and apparent concept images has been non-stop, but how much of it is accurate remains an open question. The grapevine got the title wrong, with some fan sites such as Ain\u2019t It Cool News grabbing headlines by reporting that it had confirmed the film would be called The Ancient Fear. \n \n Of course, Return of the Jedi was filmed under the fake title Blue Harvest, a common technique on high profile films to remain slightly more low-key. (The Avengers, for instance, was nicknamed Group Hug.) \n \n The new Star Wars film, which picks up three decades after the events of Return of the Jedi, is headlined by original trilogy stars Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill, Kenny Baker (R2-D2), Peter Mayhew (Chewbacca), and Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), with new additions including Lupita Nyong\u2019o (the best supporting actress Oscar-winner from 12 Years a Slave) and Gwendoline Christie, the 6-foot-3 British actress best known as the female knight Brienne of Tarth from Game of Thrones. \n \n Other new additions include Adam Driver (Girls), Oscar Isaac (Inside Llewyn Davis), John Boyega (Attack the Block), newcomer Daisy Ridley, performance-capture maestro Andy Serkis (Rise of the Planet of the Apes), Domhnall Gleeson (About Time), and the imperious Max von Sydow from The Exorcist. \n \n Hype is already underway. C-3PO star Daniels recently tweeted this expectation-setter: \n \n \"No movie sequel is better than The Empire Strikes Back.\" You might eat those words for Xmas dinner in 2015.

And the administration plans to dispatch cabinet members, including Energy Secretary Ernest J. Moniz, the nuclear physicist who helped negotiate the accord, to travel the country outlining its provisions. Mr. Moniz will appear on Friday at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, officials said. \n \n \u201cWe are confident that a sizable number of members of Congress will put politics aside and focus on what they believe is in the best interest of the United States and our national security, and if they do, a substantial number of those who follow that path will be supportive of the agreement,\u201d said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. \u201cThere\u2019s no denying that there is intense political pressure on both sides of this agreement,\u201d he continued, adding that officials were hoping that lawmakers would \u201cfocus on the specific terms of the agreement.\u201d \n \n The effort gained some momentum Tuesday as three closely watched Democratic senators \u2014 Barbara Boxer of California, Tim Kaine of Virginia and Bill Nelson of Florida \u2014 declared their backing, along with a handful of House Democrats. Mr. Obama\u2019s team is working with Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, to build support to potentially sustain a presidential veto of legislation rejecting the accord. ||||| President Obama urged support for the Iran nuclear deal while speaking at American University in Washington. He outlined the deal and denounced critics' claims that the deal would open a pathway for Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon. VPC \n \n President Obama listens as United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon speaks during their meeting in the Oval Office at the White House Tuesday. (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP) \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama will deliver a crucial speech on the Iran nuclear agreement Wednesday, arguing that the congressional vote that could block the deal is \"the most consequential foreign policy debate since the decision to go to war in Iraq,\" the White House said. \n \n White House aides said Obama would \"point out that the same people who supported war in Iraq are opposing diplomacy with Iran, and that it would be an historic mistake to squander this opportunity\" to contain Iran's nuclear program. \n \n The framing of that message appears to be a direct appeal to congressional Democrats; while some opposed the Iraq War, others came to regret their votes to authorize it. Obama will need their votes to get the one-thirds vote necessary to sustain a veto. \n \n Since the Iran deal isn't a treaty, it doesn't need congressional approval, but can be rejected with a two-thirds vote of both chambers. On Tuesday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee formally introduced a resolution to do just that, and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy promised a September vote once the House returns from its summer recess. \n \n The deal, two years in the making, would relax sanctions against Iran in exchange for a promise not to develop nuclear weapons and inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Critics, including every major Republican presidential candidate, say Iran cannot be trusted and that the economic benefits of the deal will only strengthen Iran's ability to threaten Israel and foment extremism throughout the Middle East. \n \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Obama to \"avoid tired, obviously untrue talking points about this being some choice between a bad deal and war.\" \n \n \"Of course it isn't,\" McConnell said Wednesday. \"He knows it isn't. He himself has said that 'a bad deal is worse than no deal.'\" \n \n Obama made a special appeal to the Jewish community Tuesday, meeting at the White House with about two-dozen leaders of Jewish groups that span the religious and ideological spectrum, including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the liberal J Street, and leaders of reform and orthodox congregations. \n \n The president is trying to counter a determined lobbying campaign by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who continued his months-long effort to scuttle the deal by appealing to American Jews in a webcast Tuesday. \"I don\u2019t oppose this deal because I want war,\u201d he told them. \"I oppose this deal because I want to prevent war.\u201d \n \n Wednesday's speech, at American University in Washington, is already drawing historical parallels. It's the same place President Kennedy gave his 1963 speech proposing a nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union at the apex of the Cold War. \n \n The White House seemed to be encouraging those comparisons \u2014 to a point. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said both Kennedy and Obama \"entered into a diplomatic agreement with an adversary of the United States that did succeed in advancing the national security interests of the United States.\" \n \n But unlike Kennedy, Earnest said, Obama did not have to make any concessions about its own defense. \"There\u2019s no impact from this nuclear agreement on the United States and either our nuclear programs or our military programs,\" Earnest said Tuesday. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1SML4mR ||||| President Obama lashed out at critics of the Iran nuclear deal on Wednesday, saying many of those who backed the U.S. invasion of Iraq now want to reject the Iran accord and put the Middle East on the path toward another war. \n \n Obama also said that if Congress rejects the deal, it will undermine America\u2019s standing in global diplomacy, leaving the United States isolated and putting Israel in even greater peril. \n \n While calling the nuclear accord with Iran \u201cthe strongest nonproliferation agreement ever negotiated,\u201d Obama also seemed to turn the vote on the deal into a referendum on the U.S. invasion of Iraq a dozen years ago, a decision he portrayed as the product of a \u201cmind-set characterized by a preference for military action over diplomacy.\u201d \n \n Obama said that when he first ran for president, he believed \u201cthat America didn\u2019t just have to end that war. We had to end the mind-set that got us there in the first place.\u201d He added that \u201cnow, more than ever, we need clear thinking in our foreign policy.\u201d \n \n It was the president\u2019s sharpest attack yet on opponents of the Iran nuclear deal, which he sees as a defining achievement amid an often rocky foreign policy record. \n \n President Obama hammered critics of the nuclear deal negotiated with Iran, saying Republicans in the Congress who oppose it are making \u201ccommon cause\u201d with Iranian hard-liners. (AP) \n \n [How the Obama White House runs foreign policy] \n \n In a two-hour White House meeting Tuesday night with Jewish American groups, Obama seemed particularly bothered by a multimillion-dollar ad campaign aimed at stopping the deal. On Wednesday afternoon, the president used his Twitter account to say: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a \u2018better deal.\u2019 Walking away risks war.\u201d \n \n As he nears the end of his tenure, Obama has been arguing forcefully that diplomacy can yield benefits, even as his administration continues to use targeted strikes by drones and struggles to deal with civil war in Syria, the rise of the Islamic State and confrontation with Russia over Ukraine. \n \n \u201cI have not shied away from using force when necessary,\u201d Obama said, noting he had authorized military actions in seven countries. \u201c. . . I\u2019ve had to make a lot of tough calls as president, but whether or not this deal is good for American security is not one of those calls. It\u2019s not even close.\u201d \n \n Obama spoke from American University, the same venue used by President John F. Kennedy to promote efforts to reach a landmark nuclear test-ban treaty with Moscow at the height of the Cold War. Obama invoked that 1963 speech, saying Kennedy \u201crejected the prevailing attitude among some foreign policy circles that equated security with a perpetual war footing.\u201d \n \n Instead, Obama said, Kennedy sought \u201ca practical and attainable peace, a peace based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions, on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements.\u201d \n \n But many observers felt that Obama\u2019s speech was more caustic and partisan than Kennedy\u2019s. \u201cWalk away from this agreement and you will get a better deal \u2014 for Iran,\u201d he said to critics. \n \n Here are key moments from President Obama's speech at American University on Aug. 5, addressing the international deal on Iran's nuclear program that Congress is considering. (AP) \n \n At one point, Obama brushed aside comments by Iranian hard-liners who he said do not reflect what all Iranians believe and are the \u201cmost comfortable with the status quo.\u201d The president added: \u201cIt\u2019s those hard-liners chanting \u2018Death to America\u2019 who have been most opposed to the deal. They\u2019re making common cause with the Republican caucus.\u201d \n \n Later, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called on Obama \u201cto retract his bizarre and preposterous comments\u201d and said that Democrats who have already stated their opposition would be \u201cinsulted\u201d by them. \n \n Obama did not shy away from engaging foes of the Iran deal and linking them to the decision to invade Iraq. \n \n \u201cThe single greatest beneficiary in the region of that war was the Islamic Republic of Iran, which saw its strategic position strengthened by the removal of its long-standing enemy, Saddam Hussein,\u201d Obama added. He also noted that when President George W. Bush took office, Iran did not possess any centrifuges, the machines needed to produce nuclear bomb material, while when Obama took office Iran already had installed several thousand. \n \n Even some supporters of the nuclear deal were put off by Obama\u2019s argument. Many critics of the agreement were proponents of war in Iraq, but that does not make them warmongers, said Robert Einhorn, an arms-control and nonproliferation analyst with the Brookings Institution. \n \n \u201cI think it will offend more than convert,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Wilson Center and a former Middle East negotiator at the State Department. Miller supports the agreement but said Obama\u2019s speech \u201cpaints those who are not reckless critics of this agreement with a large brush.\u201d \n \n Others who have met directly with Obama said they were impressed by the resolve with which he is making his case. They argue that the president has no choice but to fight against fierce criticism from Republican rivals and some Jewish groups opposed to the deal. \n \n Obama has been irked by ad campaigns against the deal, including one comparing him to Neville Chamberlain, the British prime minister leading up to World War II, who has been widely blamed with not standing up to Adolf Hitler. \n \n Alexandra Stanton, a board member at J Street, a group that supports the deal, said Obama \u201chas a right to combat what he thinks are campaigns against him laden with non-facts and offensive statements. He has a right to call that out, a right to say he\u2019s concerned about it and that he finds it objectionable.\u201d \n \n Obama appears to have made inroads with some Senate Democrats. On Wednesday, Sens. Chris Murphy (Conn.) and Angus King (Maine), an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, announced their support. On Tuesday, Sens. Barbara Boxer (Calif.), Timothy M. Kaine (Va.) and Bill Nelson (Fla.) backed the plan. \n \n But the president has been less successful in wooing opponents among influential Jewish American groups. \n \n \u201cHe feels the arguments that have been deployed against the deal are inaccurate and it\u2019s his job to set the record straight,\u201d said Jason Isaacson, who is the director of government and international affairs at the American Jewish Committee and attended the meeting with Obama. \n \n Although Isaacson called Obama \u201ca forceful salesman,\u201d the American Jewish Committee announced Wednesday that it would oppose the nuclear deal. \n \n Republicans also criticized how Obama has framed the debate. \n \n \u201cDoes anybody in America believe that if we turn down this deal, this president is going to engage in war with Iran?\u201d asked Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.). \u201cThat\u2019s one of those straw men that demeans the debate.\u201d \n \n The heart of Obama\u2019s address sought to hammer home the administration\u2019s views that the alternative to the deal is conflict. \n \n \u201cI say this not to be provocative,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI am stating a fact. . . . The choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy and some form of war, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not three months from now, but soon.\u201d \n \n [Both sides court every vote in Congress] \n \n Obama and other top administration officials, including Secretary of State John F. Kerry, have framed the Iran deal as a last chance to roll back Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and, in particular, the scope of its ability to enrich uranium. In exchange, international sanctions on Iran would be eased. \n \n Speaking directly to lawmakers opposing the deal, Obama said rejection would cost more than missing a chance to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program. \n \n \u201cWe will have lost something more precious,\u201d he said, \u201cAmerica\u2019s credibility as a leader of diplomacy, America\u2019s credibility as an anchor of the international system.\u201d \n \n Obama emphasized that every nation that has weighed in on the deal has backed it \u2014 except Israel, which fears for its own security and whose prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, has been among the most vocal critics. \n \n \u201cI do not doubt his sincerity, but I believe he is wrong,\u201d Obama said. \n \n The West and its allies fear that Iran\u2019s nuclear fuel facilities could one day be expanded to make weapons-grade material. Iran insists it does not seek nuclear arms but demands that it retain the capacity to make its own fuel for peaceful reactors. \n \n Under the deal reached last month, U.N. inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency would have \u201cunprecedented\u201d access to Iranian nuclear sites, Kerry has told lawmakers. But some critics have questioned provisions that require advance notice \u2014 and possible negotiations with Iran \u2014 to inspect other areas of possible nuclear-related activity. The procedure could delay inspectors by up to 24 days. \n \n Obama retorted that once an area of suspicion is identified, it would be watched \u201ccontinuously\u201d until inspectors can get to it and that they would get in even if Iran objects. \n \n Obama also addressed complaints that lifting economic pressures on Iran could end up funding Iran\u2019s military and its proxies in the region, including Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah and Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \n \n \u201cIf we are serious about confronting Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities, it is hard to imagine a worse approach than blocking this deal,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, we need to check the behavior that we are concerned about directly, by helping our allies in the region strengthen their own capabilities.\u201d \n \n The Iran pact faces widespread opposition in Congress \u2014 even among some Democrats \u2014 before the Sept. 17 deadline to vote. If Congress votes for a bill rejecting the deal, Obama has promised to veto it, setting up the key showdown over whether opponents could muster enough votes to secure an override. \n \n \u201cShut out the noise,\u201d he urged lawmakers. \u201cConsider the stakes.\u201d \n \n Brian Murphy, Carol Morello, Karoun Demirjian and Mike DeBonis contributed to this report. ||||| Returning to the theme that launched his first White House bid, President Barack Obama pitched his Iran nuclear deal Wednesday by urging Congress not to repeat its mistake of approving the 2003 Iraq War. \n \n \u201cCongressional rejection of this deal leaves any U.S. administration that is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon with one option \u2014 another war in the Middle East,\u201d Obama warned. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n In tones that alternated between impassioned, incredulous and mocking of the Iran deal\u2019s critics, Obama offered his strongest \u2014 and most political \u2014 argument yet for the agreement struck on July 14. Departing from the substance of the deal, Obama spent several minutes focusing on the track record of its opponents. \n \n \u201cThe same people who argued for the war in Iraq are now making the case against the Iran deal,\u201d Obama told an audience at American University. He said those critics exaggerate threats, obscure the true costs of war, and prefer military action over diplomacy. \n \n Obama\u2019s target audience: the few dozen undecided House and Senate Democrats who control the fate of the deal in Congress. A day before the first Republican presidential debate, Obama was also speaking to an American public with mixed views on Iran, but which overwhelmingly thinks the Iraq War was a mistake. \n \n More than at anytime in his presidency, Obama reverted to arguments he made repeatedly early in his first presidential bid. Some former aides said the speech brought back memories of Obama\u2019s insurgent primary campaign in Iowa in late 2007. \n \n \u201cWhen I ran for President eight years ago as a candidate who had opposed the decision to go to war in Iraq, I said that America didn\u2019t just have to end that war \u2014 we had to end the mindset that got us there in the first place,\u201d Obama said. \n \n Obama argued that opponents of the deal, who insist that it is too weak, are stuck in the mindset of Washington \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d and a cavalier attitude toward the unpredictable consequences of war. He urged members of Congress, who are expected to vote on the deal in September, to \u201cworry less about being labeled weak [and] worry more about getting it right.\u201d \n \n Unmentioned in Obama\u2019s speech was Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2002 vote to authorize force in Iraq, which likely allowed Obama to derail her path to the 2008 Democratic nomination. Nor did he mention identical votes by two other members of his administration who were then in the Senate: Secretary of State John Kerry and Vice President Joe Biden. Several other influential Democrats who backed the war remain in Congress, including New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer. \n \n Obama did not single out any critics, though his voice rose in frustration when he described opposition to the Iran deal \u201cin many cases offered by the same people who seem to have a compunction with being repeatedly wrong, led to a war that did more to strengthen Iran and more to isolate the United States than anything we have done in the decade since.\u201d \n \n The argument drew a quick and angry rebuke from two prominent Iraq War backers who are also fierce critics of the pact. Obama\u2019s address was \u201canother example of his reliance on endless strawmen to divert attention from his failed policies,\u201d said Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham in a joint statement. \n \n Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker also blasted the speech to POLITICO, calling it \u201cpartisan\u201d and misleading. \n \n The idea that war is the only alternative to the deal is a \u201cstraw man,\u201d Corker said. \u201cOur military officials that have sat with the administration all the way through this have said: Never ever has there been any discussion about the fact if this deal falls apart there will be military action. Never.\u201d \n \n In a statement, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce noted that, in Senate testimony last week, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey said the U.S. military had \u201ca range of options\u201d for confronting Iran short of war. \n \n Corker suggested that Obama\u2019s emphasis on the undesirability of bombing Iran \u2014 which he said would set back its program only a few years with other dangerous consequences \u2014 has undermined America\u2019s leverage. \n \n \u201cThis president is not going to carry out military action against Iran. Iran knows that,\u201d Corker said. \n \n Obama took care to note that he has ordered military action in seven countries and sent tens of thousands of U.S. troops into battle, nearly all of them in Afghanistan during his first term. \n \n Obama also infuriated some Republicans by arguing that they had made \u201ccommon cause\u201d with Iranian hard-liners opposed to the deal who chant \u201cDeath to America\u201d at public rallies. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement calling the comment \u201cbizarre\u201d and \u201coffensive,\u201d and said it \u201cgoes way over the line of civil discourse.\u201d \n \n The assault on critics of the Iran deal book-ended a speech that mainly reiterated Obama\u2019s previous arguments on behalf of the agreement, under which Iran will accept limits on its nuclear program for 10 to 15 years, and in some areas longer, in return for an end to economic sanctions. \n \n Obama repeated his argument that the deal represented the best effort of diplomacy and that a stronger alternative is not plausible. \n \n \u201cThose who say we can just walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy,\u201d Obama argued, one of several instances where he belittled his critics\u2019 arguments. White House officials say Obama has been frustrated with what he considers unserious critiques of the nuclear pact from Republicans. \n \n Elsewhere in the speech, for instance, Obama mocked \u201clobbyists and pundits [who] were suddenly transformed into armchair nuclear scientists,\u201d second-guessing credentialed experts like Energy Secretary Earnest Moniz. \n \n \u201dI\u2019ve had to make a lot of tough calls as president. But whether this deal is good for American security is not a tough call. It\u2019s not even close,\u201d Obama said. \n \n If the deal fails, he argued, \u201cthe alternatives to a military option will have been exhausted,\u201d and America will be headed toward \u201canother war in the Middle East\u201d with what he called unpredictable consequences. \n \n \u201cIf we\u2019ve learned anything from the last decade, it\u2019s that wars in general \u2014 and wars in the Middle East in particular \u2014 are anything but simple,\u201d Obama said. \n \n Congress can vote to disapprove the deal and prevent Obama from suspending tough U.S. sanctions on Iran, which could bring down the entire agreement. Obama would veto such a measure, and Congress would need a two-thirds vote in each chamber to override it. \n \n Despite a fierce lobbying campaign by opponents of the deal and the government of Israel, the agreement seems likely to survive. But the relentlessness of the administration\u2019s sales pitch \u2014 including Obama\u2019s powerful language Wednesday \u2014 indicates that the White House is not taking that outcome for granted. \n \n Obama opened his address by recalling a historic speech 52 years earlier at the same location by President John F. Kennedy, who argued for negotiating with the Soviet Union in the name of world peace. \u201cStrength, in his view, included powerful armed forces and a willingness to stand up for our values around the world,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut he rejected the prevailing attitude among some foreign policy circles that equated security with a perpetual war footing.\u201d \n \n The speech opened on a lighter note when Obama, who arrived nearly 40 minutes late, explained the reason for his tardiness: \u201cI apologize for the slight delay,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cEven presidents have problems with toner.\u201d \n \n Burgess Everett contributed to this report.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 President Obama today began his campaign to convince Congress to back his Iran nuclear deal with a major speech in which he characterized the upcoming vote as one about war or peace. If the deal falls through, opponents can expect a likely outcome, he said at American University: \u201cAnother war in the Middle East.\u201d Obama added that \u201cI am not saying this to be provocative,\u201d reports the Washington Post. \u201cI am stating a fact ... the choice we have is some kind of war, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not in three months, but soon.\u201d In the speech, Obama also drew a parallel with the vote to authorize the Iraq war. \u201cMany of the same people who made the case for war with Iraq\u201d oppose the Iran deal, he said. They need to \u201cworry less about being labeled weak [and] worry more about getting it right,\" because that war \"did more to strengthen Iran and more to isolate the United States than anything we have done in the decade since,\" reports Politico. The Iraq message seems to be aimed at Democrats who voted in favor of the war and now regret it, because Obama will need their votes to sustain any veto, reports USA Today.

VA spokeswoman Sonja Brown said VA staff told her that at least 20 minutes elapsed between the man\u2019s medical episode and when he arrived at the ER. \n \n Kirtland Air Force Medical Group personnel, who regularly eat lunch at the cafeteria, performed CPR until the ambulance arrived, Brown said. \n \n Staff followed policy in calling 911 when the man collapsed on Monday, she said. \n \n \u201cOur policy is under expedited review,\u201d Brown said. \n \n Brown said the policy is a local one, and Jean Schaefer, spokeswoman for the Phoenix-based regional VA network, said these types of medical center policies vary across VA campuses, depending on what facilities are there. \n \n Brown also said she\u2019s not aware of any vehicles owned by the VA that could have transported the veteran. \n \n National Veterans Affairs representatives did not respond to a request for comment Thursday. \n \n The man\u2019s name hasn\u2019t been released. \n \n News of the man\u2019s death at the Raymond G.

The buildings include the main hospital in Building 41, but the cafeteria or canteen aren\u2019t mentioned. \n \n Code Blue Team members include a physician, an intensive care unit nurse, a health technician, a nursing supervisor, an anesthesiologist, a respiratory therapist and a pharmacist, if needed. \n \n The policy goes on to state: \u201cFor medical emergencies out of the Code Blue Team response areas, the Albuquerque EMS system via 911 will be activated,\u201d the policy states. Outpatients or non-patients responded to by Albuquerque EMS who have suffered a cardiac and/or respiratory arrest will be transported to the VA medical center\u2019s emergency department, the policy adds. \n \n Outpatients or non-patients who haven\u2019t suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest will be transported per Albuquerque EMS protocols.

    "document": "An attorney for the Texas teen who cited \"affluenza\" as a defense in a deadly drunken-driving wreck told FoxNews.com Friday he needed to ensure his client was not \"mistreated according to the Mexican constitution.\" \n \n Fernando Benitez, who has represented 18-year-old Ethan Couch in Mexico, spoke to FoxNews.com over the phone, and called the teen's current legal fight \"an international law case only.\" He said that as a judge is currently considering Couch's detention and possible deportation, \"we are not here to delve into the past.\" \n \n Benitez denied reports that Couch had a gun at the time of his detention. \n \n Couch won a delay in his deportation based on a constitutional appeal in Mexico that could lead to a trial process lasting weeks or even months. Any flaw in the process of his detention by Mexican immigration authorities can be considered a violation of due process and of his human rights, legal analysts say. \n \n Benitez said Mexican authorities pushed for a \"fast-track\" deportation, which he argued would expose Couch to \"a criminal procedure in the United States which may not be up to Mexican constitutional standards.\" He said Couch's Texas-based defense team asked him to intervene after the teen was caught in Mexico. \n \n Tarrant County Sheriff Dee Anderson has said he believes Couch and his mother, Tonya, fled to Mexico in late November after a video surfaced that appears to show Couch at a party where people were drinking, which would be a violation of his probation. The mother and son were arrested Monday after using a phone to order pizza delivery that was traced to a condominium complex in the Mexican resort city of Puerto Vallarta. \n \n Couch, who was 16 at the time of the crash and was tried in juvenile court, received 10 years' probation for driving drunk and crashing into a disabled SUV parked on the side of the road in 2013. The collision killed four people and injured several others, including passengers in his truck. He pleaded guilty to four counts of intoxication manslaughter and two counts of intoxication assault causing serious bodily injury. \n \n During the sentencing phase of his trial, a defense expert argued that Couch's wealthy parents had coddled him into a sense of irresponsibility -- a condition the expert termed \"affluenza.\" The condition is not recognized as a medical diagnosis by the American Psychiatric Association, and its invocation drew ridicule. \n \n Judge Jean Boyd sentenced Couch to probation over the objections of prosecutors who asked for 20 years' detention. Couch's attorneys argued probation would be more effective than detention because Couch could have been eligible for release in as few as two years. \n \n Unless he files for asylum, he will not be able to stay in Mexico indefinitely, said Aldo Salazar, a Texas attorney also licensed to practice in Mexico. \n \n \"Asylum is granted to those who can prove a well-founded fear of persecution. I'm not sure `affluenza' would qualify,\" said immigration attorney Nicolas Chavez. \n \n Tonya Couch, 48, was returned to the United States early Thursday after her deportation from Mexico. She has been charged in Tarrant County with hindering an apprehension, a felony charge that carries a two- to 10-year prison sentence, and is being held on a $1 million bond. \n \n Ethan Couch was transferred Thursday to a Mexico City immigration detention center in one of the capital's poorest areas. A Mexican immigration official said the affluent young man will have no special privileges at the Agujas immigration detention center, where detainees sleep in common areas and use concrete basins to hand-wash clothes. \n \n \"Is there a chance that Ethan Couch could be successful in staying in Mexico?

I don't think that's okay.\" \n \n MORE: Reports on Ethan Couch \n \n Benitez says he's filing a petition essentially saying that Couch's constitutional and civil rights may have been violated. \n \n He says the teen's crimes here in the United States should have no bearing on Mexican officials, or Mexican courts. \n \n \"There is no formal extradition request by the U.S. State Department filed,\" he said. \"They want to get him for not having the proper migratory papers, and have this executive decision.\" \n \n Ethan Couch's attorney in Mexico speaks \n \n Couch and his mother Tonya were detained by Mexican officials on Monday night in Puerto Vallarta at a run-down apartment building. \n \n They had been on the run from U.S. officials after Couch missed a probation meeting in early December. He's serving 10 years probation for killing four people in a drunk driving accident in 2013. \n \n Although his mother, Tonya, was deported Wednesday evening, her son was granted a temporary injunction by a Mexican judge, thanks to Benitez's last-minute legal maneuvers. \n \n The attorney says an evidence hearing in the case likely won't happen until the end of the month, while both sides file additional court documents during the interim. \n \n \"From the hearing, a judge has up to 90 days to issue a ruling,\" he said. \"After that, we could appeal a decision. We're going to take this to the full extent of our capacity and have whoever needs to review it.\" \n \n Before being detained, Couch and his mother were believed to have stayed at a different Mexican resort, where workers told ABC News that Couch had a handgun. \n \n Benitez says the hotel employee's story is suspect, and insists his client didn't have a gun when he was detained. \n \n \"The likelihood of that story being true, for me, is zero percent,\" he said. \n \n He hopes to meet with Couch on Tuesday of next week in Mexico City, where the teen is being held at an immigration facility. It is not a prison, and is mostly filled with people who have run adrift of Mexico's immigration policies. \n \n Representatives from Benitez's office already met with the teen and said he hadn't experienced any harm or mistreatment while in custody. \n \n Tonya Couch is in a Los Angeles jail cell pending a hearing and eventual transfer back to Texas. She's facing a charge of Hindering Apprehension of a Felon, and has a bail at $1 million. \n \n Benitez's previous big cases include a successful bid to free Marine Sgt. Andrew Tahmooressi from a Mexican jail. He was imprisoned in 2014 for more than 200 days after he said he accidentally drove into the country with three guns. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://on.wfaa.com/1R2JsDP",

Benitez is looking into whether Couch's human rights or due process were violated when he was detained in Mexico last week, according to Fox News. He says it could be months before Couch's return to the US is even a possibility. \"He hasn't committed a crime in Mexico,\" Benitez tells WFAA. \"Why would Mexico go along with this idea of locating someone and summarily kicking them out of the country so the marshals can grab him across the border?

The lawyer says the legal treatment Couch gets in the US \"may not be up to Mexican constitutional standards.\" According to CBS, Benitez denies earlier reports Couch was in possession of a gun while in Mexico. Couch is currently being held in an immigration facility in Mexico City, WFAA reports. His mother was deported last Thursday.

    "document": "Bravo! Chicago is a lock for George Lucas\u2019 museum. \n \n Mayor Rahm Emanuel has won a fierce competition with Los Angeles and San Francisco to house a first-of its-kind interactive museum housing movie mogul George \u201cStar Wars\u201d Lucas\u2019 formidable collection of artwork and movie memorabilia! \n \n Shortly after Sneed\u2019s scoop that Chicago had won the bidding war, Lucas issued a statement from San Francisco: \u201cBuilding in Chicago is the right decision for the museum, but the Bay Area will always be my home. I grew up here, made all my films here and raised my family in the Bay Area.\u201d \n \n Chicago\u2019s lakefront museum campus will house the new $1 billion Lucas Museum of Narrative Art on a 17-acre site located on parking lots between Soldier Field and McCormick Place. It will open in 2018. \n \n \u201cGeorge Lucas has revolutionized the art of storytelling over the last four decades and we are honored to be the recipient of this incredible legacy investment that will allow everyone to learn about and experience narrative arts,\u201d Emanuel said in a statement. \n \n \u201cLike Marshall Field, John G. Shedd and Max Adler before him, George\u2019s philanthropy will inspire and educate for generations. No other museum like this exists in the world, making it a tremendous educational, cultural and job creation asset for all Chicagoans, as well as an unparalleled draw for international tourists,\u201d added the mayor. \n \n The Lucas museum board also credited Chicago for providing a larger location; its easy accessibility to public transportation; and the fact it is centrally located in a city renowned for its love of art and architecture. \n \n Lucas \u2014 who is married to Chicago businesswoman/civic leader Mellody Hobson \u2014 originally wanted to build the 95,000-square-foot museum in his hometown of San Francisco, on Crissy Field in the national park known as the Presidio. \n \n But when site proposals on the field were rejected, Emanuel moved fast in February and quickly became a front-runner to snag the project. \n \n \u201cI am humbled to be joining such an extraordinary museum community and to be creating the Museum in a city that has a long tradition of embracing the arts and architecture,\u201d Lucas said in a statement on the museum\u2019s website. \n \n Shortly after a phone call thanking Lucas and Hobson for choosing Chicago, Emanuel told reporters outside his City Hall office Monday evening that the museum will create \u201cone of the most tremendous, vibrant and green museum campuses of any major American city that will partner education with our neighborhood schools and create jobs throughout the city of Chicago.\u201d \n \n It will bring \u201chundreds of jobs and economic opportunity,\u201d Emanuel said. \n \n He added: \u201cThis is a milestone for the city, but it is just one milestone on a journey as we build this new museum.\u201d \n \n Ironically, former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, who attended a Step IT Up America conference with Emanuel in Chicago recently, wrote a column last Saturday for SFGate.com stating that he felt confident his city could beat the Lucas site proposed for Chicago. \n \n Little did he know that the city that dawdled would get dismissed. \n \n \u25c6 The stats: The museum is completely self-funded; will be built, funded and endowed by Lucas; and has been described as a \u201chistory of storytelling\u201d project \u201cdedicated to the power of the visual image\u201d as well as the world\u2019s largest interactive museum. \n \n Lucas said he wanted his museum to be close to the water, enveloped by nature and centrally located. He talked about enhancing the green space around it by taking much of the museum parking underground. \n \n Welcome to your second home, George. \n \n Mellody has given us the gift of you . . . and what a gift you are giving us. \n \n MAP: Proposed Location: ||||| Video: George Lucas' museum in Chicago, what you need to know \n \n \u201cStar Wars\u201d creator George Lucas has selected Chicago over Los Angeles and San Francisco as the future home of his collection of art and movie memorabilia, according to a spokeswoman for the museum. \n \n The museum's board Wednesday is expected to vote on a name change \u2014 from the Lucas Cultural Arts Museum to the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art \u2014 and destination. \n \n Pending approval by the Chicago Plan Commission, Lucas' institution would be built on what are now parking lots between Soldier Field and McCormick Place and would open in 2018. Architectural renderings will be presented to city officials in early fall, according to a statement from the museum. \n \n The decision to select Chicago reflects both a bungling of the billionaire's legacy project by the board of a national park in San Francisco as well as an aggressive lobbying effort by Mayor Rahm Emanuel. \n \n \u201cI am humbled to be joining such an extraordinary museum community and to be creating the museum in a city that has a long tradition of embracing the arts and architecture,\u201d Lucas said in a statement. He added, \u201cChoosing Chicago is the right decision for the museum, but a difficult decision for me personally because of my strong personal and professional roots in the Bay Area.\u201d \n \n Lucas declined an interview request through a spokeswoman. \n \n The 70-year-old filmmaker is a native of Modesto, Calif., but he built his career in San Francisco. He never made a movie in Hollywood. He recently married a Chicagoan, Ariel Investments President Mellody Hobson, and lives here part time. \n \n The museum will house a collection that includes valuable Norman Rockwell paintings, examples of the special effects he pioneered at Industrial Light & Magic, and memorabilia such as the Darth Vader costume. \n \n The works are wrapped around the theme of storytelling. Many pieces, such as Lucas' collection of magazine illustrations, predate the arrival of moving pictures, television and radio, said Laurie Norton Moffatt, chief executive officer of the Norman Rockwell Museum, who is advising Lucas. \n \n \u201cIt's still an emerging and growing collection,\u201d she said. She noted that Lucas \u201chas an extraordinary collection of movie posters. I think he has the largest collection in the world.\u201d \n \n According to a source, two factors weighed in Chicago's favor. \n \n One was that the city draws far more tourists than San Francisco. Chicago set a record in 2012 with 46.37 million visitors while the city of San Francisco attracted 16.51 million visitors that year, according to the San Francisco Travel Association. \n \n In addition, the site Emanuel offered is near the Museum Campus, home to the Shedd Aquarium, Field Museum and Adler Planetarium. Lucas hopes to collaborate with his prospective neighbors, the source said. \n \n \u201cI just got off the phone with George Lucas and Mellody Hobson to thank them for choosing Chicago, the most American of American cities,\u201d Emanuel said at a news conference Tuesday. \u201cWith this new museum, the Lucas museum, we have a tremendous opportunity in the city of Chicago, as they partner with the schools throughout the city of Chicago and make a tremendous investment in the city.\u201d \n \n Still, the museum has drawn opposition from open-space advocates, such as Friends of the Parks. \n \n Among the 14 \u201cbasic policies\u201d of the Lakefront Plan of Chicago, adopted by the city council in 1973, is that \u201cin no instance will further private development be permitted east of Lake Shore Drive.\u201d And the Lakefront Protection Ordinance says that the plan commission's decisions \u201cshall be made in conformity with\u201d those policies. \n \n \u201cWe will do what it takes and that very well may be a lawsuit,\u201d Friends of the Parks President Cassandra Francis said. \u201cWe are in coalition-building mode, but we are very optimistic, based on discussions, that we will have a broad group of organizations joining us\u201d in opposing the lakefront location for the museum. \n \n Under Emanuel's plan, the two Chicago Park District-owned parking lots would be leased to the museum for $1, which is similar to arrangements other large cultural institutions have with the Park District. \n \n But unlike other museums, the Lucas museum would not receive taxpayer subsidies to cover a portion of its operations, a top mayoral aide has said. \n \n The parking lots would be moved underground at Lucas' expense, the city has said. \n \n What that means for Chicago Bears tailgaters remains unclear. \n \n While Emanuel did not take questions Tuesday, he did respond to a shouted question about tailgating: \u201cWe've worked that issue out, and it will be continued.\u201d \n \n The theory is that the parking lots are an ideal location because the museum would draw conventioneers from neighboring McCormick Place. In addition, the 17-acre plot of land is large enough to house the museum while leaving about 12 acres for new green space. \n \n The city got a shot at the museum because Lucas was unable to nail down an agreement for his first choice: a San Francisco bayside location on Crissy Field, part of a former Army base that was turned into an urban national park known as the Presidio. In a statement Tuesday, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee said the Presidio's board \u201cunwisely rejected\u201d Lucas' preferred site and \u201cforced\u201d him to consider Chicago. \n \n \u201cThese opportunities to attract hundreds of millions of dollars in private and philanthropic investment to create new public amenities for arts and education, as Mr. Lucas had proposed, come along rarely,\u201d Lee said. \u201cI am disappointed that San Francisco will not benefit from this renowned art collection and significant private investment by Mr. Lucas that would have been enjoyed by our families and children for generations to come.\u201d \n \n In addition to covering construction costs, Lucas has said the museum would accumulate a $400 million endowment over time. \n \n Since marrying, Lucas and Hobson have given generously to Chicago institutions, committing $25 million each to two local, education-focused charities: the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools and After School Matters. \n \n Lucas is worth an estimated $5.1 billion, putting him at No. 296 on Forbes' list of the world's billionaires. If he lived here full time, he would be Chicago's second-wealthiest resident. \n \n Tribune reporters Bill Ruthhart, Blair Kamin and Mitch Smith contributed. \n \n mmharris@tribune.com \n \n Twitter @chiconfidential",

    "document": "Transformers: Age of Extinction SCIENCE FICTION/ACTION: United States, 2014 U.S. Release Date: 2014-06-27 Running Length: 2:45 MPAA Classification: PG-13 (Violence, Profanity, Painful Dialogue) Theatrical Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1 Cast: Mark Wahlberg , Stanley Tucci, Kelsey Grammer, Nicola Peltz, Jack Reynor, Titus Welliver, Peter Cullen (voice), John Goodman (voice) Director: Michael Bay Screenplay: Ehren Kruger Cinematography: Amir Mokri Music: Steve Jablonsky U.S. Distributor: Paramount Pictures Subtitles: none \n \n Michael Bay has often said how he loves to \"blow things up real good.\" Well, if that's his desire in life, there's little doubt that he tops himself in Transformers: Age of Extinction. This is as excruciating a movie as is likely to be experienced by anyone, anywhere. It isn't merely that the story is insulting, the characters are bland, the action is dull, and the CGI is everywhere - it's that all this goes on for nearly three hours. That's three hours of your life you'll never get back. \n \n Bay's argument is that the Transformers movies are made for the little kid in all of us. That might be true, assuming the kid is pugnacious, antisocial, afflicted with an attention span approaching zero, and lacking in anything remotely resembling a creative impulse. My inner child often delights in silly, loud, or otherwise unsophisticated films. Parts of Godzilla gave me chills. Misgivings aside, I'm looking forward to the next Star Wars. And, despite its recent precipitous nosedive, I still adore Doctor Who. But that inner child quails at the thought of enduring even one more minute of a Transformers movie. The only thing more epic about this film than its running length is its soullessness. \n \n Bay keeps saying he's done with the Transformers franchise but it draws him back like flies to shit. This time around, the human actors from the earlier films have been jettisoned. At first glance, that might seem like a good thing until one realizes that people in Bay films are as interesting and important as background d\u00e9cor. It's really all about the robots, the orgiastic display of CGI destruction, and (of course) the explosions. I wish I could say \"just sit back and enjoy the ride\", but there's a reason roller coasters are only a few minutes long. \n \n Is there a story here? It's not War and Peace but there's something that might be mistaken for the skeleton of a plot if viewed in dim light. For those who care about continuity, events in Transformers: Age of Extinction take place five years after those of the previous film, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. By this time, the Transformers have been virtually eliminated from Earth as a result of a ruthless cleansing scheme spearheaded by CIA Black Ops hotshot Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammer in full Stinky Pete mode). Attinger has help from a Decepticon called \"Lockdown\" (voice of Mark Ryan), who has come to Earth in search of Optimus Prime (voice of Peter Cullen). The CIA bad guy has also formed an alliance with billionaire inventor Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci), who has figured out how to build Transformers. His pilot project is something he calls \"Galvatron\" (voice of Frank Welker) - a robot that looks an awful like the dreaded (and supposedly dead) Megatron. \n \n The basic thrust of Transformers: Age of Extinction follows the misadventures of four surviving Autobots - Bumblebee, Hound (voice of John Goodman), Crosshairs (voice of John DiMaggio), and Drift (voice of Ken Watanabe) - as they seek out Optimus Prime, who has been revived with the help of Texas mechanic Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg). Along with Cade, his daughter, Tessa (Nicola Peltz), and Tessa's boyfriend, Shane (Jack Reynor), the Autobots seek to avoid being captured or destroyed by Lockdown while possibly saving Earth from Galvatron. (Lockdown doesn't really care about humans - he just wants Optimus Prime.) Bay once again deals Chicago a gut punch but this time around he saves the real destruction for Hong Kong. \n \n In the acting department, Mark Wahlberg is an upgrade on Shia Labeouf, although it hardly matters. Walhberg does his job and stands around looking suitably awed, angry, or frightened, depending on what the script requires. Somehow, Stanley Tucci manages to rise above the material and leave an impression. It helps that he's used partially for comedic relief and gets to utter the best one-liner (one that uses up the movie's PG-13 single \"f-word\" allowance). Tucci's success is counterbalanced by Nicola Peltz's failure. The Transformers movies have had their share of annoying characters but none (not even the one played by Megan Fox) has achieved the apex occupied by Peltz's Tessa, who one-ups the worst horror movie heroine in terms of incompetence, ignorance, and irritation factor. On more than one occasion, I was actively rooting for a robot to stomp on her or for her to fall from a great height and make a satisfying splat. I guess this could be considered a step forward for Bay - he made me feel something about a human being in a Transformers film. \n \n In the end, there's a sense that nothing much happens in Transformers: Age of Extinction, although that \"nothing\" is long, loud, and flashy. Bay's approach, which is technically proficient but without charm or life, bludgeons viewers into a near-catatonic state. If one takes a step back and looks at Transformers: Age of Extinction from a distance, the story isn't confusing but, while watching it, the sense of chaos is almost overwhelming. Shakespeare didn't know it, but when he wrote of \"sound and fury signifying nothing,\" he could have been describing this franchise. \n \n I understand that this is a \"fanboy\" driven production intended only to please those who either play with Transformers toys or have fond memories of doing so in their youth. However, it's disappointing to see how contemptuous the filmmakers are of anyone who pays good money to see a movie in the hope that it will offer more than cool special effects (that become progressively less \"cool\" the longer the film runs). This is blockbuster moviemaking at its worst - a product so cynical that it doesn't try to pretend it's anything more than a mindless spectacle. It's endless, tiresome, and tedious, but it will make so much money that Transformers 5 is a foregone conclusion. I can't think of a more compelling reason to hate Transformers: Age of Extinction. \n \n Discuss this topic in the ReelViews Forums. ||||| To give Bay his due, Transformers is a testament to advances in CGI. The tableau of a giant alien spaceship hovering over Chicago, for instance, is breathtaking. Moments like that are quickly drowned out in the excessive uproar of this clanking cinematic claptrap. Go if you must, but bring earplugs. ||||| Do you ever think to yourself, gee, I wish someone would beat on my skull with a hammer today? \n \n If so, you're in luck. \ufffdTransformers: Age of Extinction\ufffd will be in theaters everywhere starting Thursday night. As self-destructive cinematic experiences go, it can't be beat. \n \n As a movie, though, it is absolute garbage. Repetitive beyond belief, soulless and shamelessly, endlessly chaotic. \n \n This is, of course, the \ufffdTransformers\ufffd tradition, although the franchise's last installment showed some hope. But here director Michael Bay has elected to get back to basics \ufffd in other words, banging on audience skulls. \n \n The story: Good outer space robots are now in hiding and the CIA (why the CIA?) is hunting them down with the help of a bad outer space robot who probably has a name, but who cares? \n \n In Texas, a down-on-his-luck inventor named Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) buys a beat-up semi truck and discovers it's actually the damaged Optimus Prime (biggest of the good robots). Despite the protestations of his beautiful teen daughter (Nicola Peltz), he nurses it back to health. \n \n Which is when the bad CIA guys show up, leading to endless battles and explosions. \n \n Prime gets what few surviving good robots exist back together, they team up with Yeager, daughter and a superfluous boyfriend (Jack Reynor), and all set out to do battle with government types, scientists, outer space robots and their clones. Explosions, explosions, junkyards battling, explosions. Repeat, repeat, repeat. \n \n The film was shot partly in Detroit, but mainly it's Chicago and Hong Kong that get torn to shreds over the next two hours and 45 minutes. \n \n Seriously, the next movie should just be called \ufffdTransformers: Hammer to the Skull.\ufffd \n \n People would still go. They might even pay extra. \n \n 'Transformers: Age of Extinction' \n \n GRADE: D \n \n Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi violence and action, language and brief innuendo. Running time: 165 minutes",

    "document": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Elisha Fieldstadt \n \n An attendant at a teen soccer game in Florida over the weekend called police on a father who instructed his son from the sidelines, in what many are saying is the latest example of a white person dialing 911 on a black person who had done nothing wrong. \n \n Ginger Williams, who was watching the game, posted photos of the incident to Facebook on Sunday with the heading \"Soccer While Black.\" She said a woman in a golf cart at the game in St. Johns County told a black father that \"harassment won't be tolerated,\" even though he had been directing his son to listen to the referee. \n \n Chuck Mulligan, a spokesman for the St. Johns County Sheriff's Department, said the woman who called police, being dubbed \"Golfcart Gail,\" is a field marshal. \n \n The father informed the marshal that he was only speaking to his son and not the referee, which is not allowed, but \"Golfcart Gail just would not let this go,\" Williams wrote. \n \n The father, whose identity has not been revealed, began to leave in an effort to defuse the situation, Williams said, but the woman in the golf cart still called police saying, \"she no longer felt safe with his threatening behavior.\" \n \n Maria Morales-Walther filmed the encounter in which the father tells the field marshal, \"I wasn\u2019t talking to you. ... I was talking to my son, and I still get this from you.\" \n \n Morales-Walter said when deputies arrived, the woman told them that the father \"was being aggressive and 'coming at' her,\" but \"in my video, that was the most aggression he showed.\" \n \n \"I started filming because she would not leave the father alone,\" Morales-Walter told NBC News. \"There was no reason for her to call the cops,\" she said, adding that the woman had not identified herself as a field attendant of any kind. \n \n Another video, shot by Ginger Williams, shows two St. Johns County deputies arrive at the game. \n \n The father explained to one of them that he did nothing wrong. \"I was talking to my son, no one else ... Listen I play by the rules. I know how sports are,\" the father says. \n \n \"I don\u2019t understand why this woman felt the need to call the police on this man,\" Williams can be heard saying in the video as she films. The officer tells her that \"anybody can call the police at any time for any reason. We'll respond.\" \n \n Williams wrote in her Facebook post that the field marshal had not called police on a parent who had been \"ejected from this game\" due to a \"disturbance.\" \n \n Gary Easom, president of the Ponte Vedra Athletic Association, the athletic association the field marshal works for, said in a statement that \"authorities were not called solely for this particular incident, but as a result of a culmination of several immediate prior incidents\" at the game. \n \n Those incidents included a parent being kicked out of the game for being verbally abusive to the teenage referees, and another parent getting scolded for cursing in the stands, Easom told NBC affiliate WTLV. \n \n \"I have parents that are out of control and need to be removed from a youth soccer game,\" the field marshal can be heard in audio from the 911 call telling a dispatcher. \n \n Easom said if game attendees \"behave badly\" after warnings, \"staff is left with no choice but to call law enforcement.\" \n \n \"That is an extreme circumstance which seldom occurs, but that is exactly what happened in this situation,\" he added. \"Our team acted appropriately to protect the children.\" \n \n The deputy eventually told the father that he had no reason to detain him, to which the field marshal responds: \"Good, I didn't want anything like that done.\" \n \n Mulligan, the spokesman for the sheriff's department, said the department gets about 40 disturbance calls a day, and is obligated to respond. He said the officers spoke with those remaining at the game, and \"found that there was no crime whatsoever.\" \n \n The situation was one of three in a week in which white people have been recorded and shamed on social media for calling police or claiming to call police on black people who are going about their daily routines. \n \n Last Wednesday, a woman in New York City said she was calling police after accusing a 9-year-old of grabbing her backside. Surveillance footage showed he hadn't. And on Friday, a black man filmed as a white woman tried to block him from getting into his apartment building because she didn't believe he lived there. He said officers showed up to his apartment after he proved to her that he did. ||||| JACKSONVILLE, Fl -- During a soccer game Sunday at Davis Park in St. Johns County a verbal confrontation between a parent and a field marshal turned into allegations of racial profiling. \n \n The alleged incident happened off the field and portions were captured via cell phone. \n \n Gerald Jones, the parent, said he was telling his son, who was playing with the visiting team from Oakleaf, that the referee is always right and to do what the referee says. \n \n Jones said within moments he was confronted by a field marshal who was riding in a golf cart. \n \n \"Then she went, 'I am going to call the police,'\" he said. \n \n And she did. When St. Johns County Deputies showed up, he told them the same account of what happened. \n \n But the cell phone recording of the field marshal's account to the deputy was different. \n \n She was overheard saying, \"He just got nasty with me.\" \n \n Maria Walther was a witness to the incident. She was sitting next to Jones when it got out of control. \n \n \"He was pretty much telling her 'leave me alone, I am leaving I am grabbing my stuff,'\" said Walther, \"but that wasn't enough for her.\" \n \n Sign up for the GMJ On the Go Thanks for signing up!

The PVAA Code of Conduct protects children in a number of ways, including the prohibition of inappropriate conduct such as berating referees, coaches or athletes, and \"coaching\" children from the sidelines. Unfortunately, parents sometimes violate the conduct code while watching games. When such violations occur, our staff addresses the violator or violators and ask that they behave appropriately. If, after warnings, the violators continue to behave badly, staff is left with no choice but to call law enforcement, consistent with county policy. That is an extreme circumstance which seldom occurs, but that is exactly what happened in this situation. The authorities were not called solely for this particular incident but as a result of a culmination of several immediate prior incidents. The field marshal acted appropriately and without malice to ensure the welfare of the children she is charged with protecting. Unfortunately, an incomplete narrative of this incident was posted and sensationalized, creating a wholly inaccurate and irresponsible version with little relation to what actually happened that day. It was an unfortunate incident and I am sorry it happened, but our team acted appropriately to protect the children, consistent with our organizational mission.\" \n \n Was it perception or was Jones racially profiled?

Jennifer Schulte, who has become known on social media as \u201cBBQ Becky,\u201d was identified by The Root and News One, and widely on social media. Schulte, 41, could not be reached for comment about the video by Heavy and has not spoken out about the incident. \n \n The video was posted on YouTube by Michelle Snider on April 29 just hours after the incident. The story went viral after Snider and her husband, Kenzie Smith, talked to KRON-TV on May 9. The incident occurred amid a string of viral incidents in which white people called the police on people of color for controversial reasons, including a white Starbucks manager who called the police on two men who were waiting for a business meeting, a white woman who called the police on a group of black people staying at an AirBnB, a white mother who reported two Native American teens to police because she didn\u2019t think they belonged on a college tour and a white Ph.D student who called the police on a Yale University grad student who was napping in a dorm common room while studying for finals. The incident has also drawn comparisons to a viral video of a Manhattan lawyer ranting about restaurant workers speaking Spanish. \n \n Here\u2019s what you need to know about Jennifer Schulte and the incident: \n \n 1. Schulte Was Evaluated for an Involuntary Psychiatric Hold by Police \n \n The nearly 25-minutelong video of the incident was posted on YouTube on April 29 by Michelle Snider, who uses the handle Michelle Dionne on YouTube. The video begins after a confrontation had already been ongoing between the woman identified as Jennifer Schulte and Snider\u2019s family and friends. \u201cAt around 11:20 AM a white woman approached a black man named Deacon for having a BBQ grill at Lake Merritt today. \n \n She told him he could not BBQ there and called the police. She would not leave Deacon alone. A young black woman was walking by overheard how the white woman was harassing him telling him he can not be there, she stopped and asked the woman to leave her alone. The white woman became aggressive with the woman,\u201d Snider wrote on YouTube. \u201cShortly after that Deacon\u2019s friend Kenzie arrived. According to Kenzie, the woman said \u2018Oh another n*gger.\u2019 She proceeded to tell all three of the people at the BBQ table that she owned the park, and they are not allowed there. She also said them they were going to jail.\u201d The racist comment allegedly made by the woman was not caught on video. \n \n Snider, who is Smith\u2019s wife, said her husband texted her a picture of the woman and said, \u201cIf I go to jail this is who did it to me.\u201d Snider, who was at a nearby restaurant, then walked over to the park and arrived about 12:50 p.m., which is when the video begins. The video shows the interaction between Snider, her husband and others with the woman identified as Schulte. Snider follows the woman as she continues to call police to try to get them to respond to the park. When the officer eventually does arrive, the woman begins to cry as she talks to him, as the video ends. \n \n \u201cThis is exactly what is the problem with Oakland today. This lady wants to sit here and call the police on them for having a barbecue at the lake as if this is not normal,\u201d Michelle Snider told KRON-TV. Snider said the woman told them it was illegal to have a charcoal barbecue in the area where they were having their cookout. According to KRON, an Oakland Parks and Recreation map shows that the area is not a designated charcoal area, but is an area where portable non-charcoal grills can be used. Lake Merritt has three areas with stationary charcoal grills for public use, according to the map. But residents and officials told the news station that the rule is not typically followed or enforced, and is not a police matter. \n \n \u201cI have seen people barbecue with charcoal for years,\u201d Kenzie Smith told the news station. \u201cShe said that we were trespassing, we were not welcome, and then she turned back around and said, \u2018ya\u2019ll going to jail.\u2019 I think we need to question the policies that made this woman think woman feel she had the right to harass people.\u201d \n \n Oakland City Councilmember Lynette Gibson McElhaney told the news station, \u201cI think it is really incumbent on all of us that when we call police, it is for emergency purposes.\u201d She suggested there were other options than calling the police, telling the news station, \u201cI want to encourage people to know when to call the police, when to raise a question of regulations with the city council, maybe there is a passive way to reach out to us. \n \n Oakland Police said responding officers took a police report, but no citations were issued and no arrests were made. \n \n On May 24, police released a log that reveals more details about the call. The officer told dispatchers he evaluated Schulte for a 5150 psychiatric hold, but determined that she \u201cdidn\u2019t fit the criteria,\u201d according to the report obtained by KTVU-TV. \n \n \u201cA 5150 in California allows a police officer or another professional to take a person into custody for up to 72 hours to evaluate their mental state and whether they are a danger to themselves or to others,\u201d KTVU reports. \n \n The incident took about 3 hours, with Schulte on the phone with police nearly the entire time, records show. At one point, the dispatcher told responding officers Schulte, \u201csounds 5150.\u201d \n \n 2. \u2018BBQ Becky\u2019 Memes Have Spread Across Social Media \n \n In the days after the video went viral, the woman has become a meme on social media known as \u201cBBQ Becky.\u201d According to Know Your Meme, \u201cBBQ Becky, also known as White Woman Calling the Cops, refers to a series of Photoshop memes of a woman in sunglasses calling the police in a park on a group of African American people having a cookout in an Oakland, Ca park. The image has been edited into photographs of the civil rights milestones as well as captions that mock the woman for calling the police.\u201d Becky is a n You can see some of the memes below: \n \n @jemelehill now we know who really got Rosa Parks in trouble pic.twitter.com/uwYDPNU45E \u2014 Squatty Bell (@Squatty386) May 13, 2018 \n \n Black Twitter Meme Council, I respectful propose that 'Black Man on Phone' be replaced with 'White Lady Spoils BBQ'. pic.twitter.com/H9dRKT2PGe \u2014 Roy Wood Jr- Ex Jedi (@roywoodjr) May 11, 2018 \n \n \"Hi, I'd like to report a graduation.\" pic.twitter.com/V2EiKOvNQ5 \u2014 Tim Barnes (@TimBarnes451) May 12, 2018 \n \n The woman who posted the original video tweeted one of the memes: \n \n I knew this woman would turn into a meme \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude39 pic.twitter.com/uxN6ZXrmaB \u2014 Michelle Dione \ud83d\udc08 (@ShelleDione) May 10, 2018 \n \n \u201cBeyond the \u2018Cookout Beckie\u2019 aka \u2018BBQBeckie\u2019 memes and jokes, the reason why this story resonates so much in the Black community is that there is a pattern of people, white people, calling the police on Black people, which often ends up being scary at the very least, or deadly. Even cops have complained that white people waste their time with irrational fear of Black people, imagine that!\u201d AfroPunk writes. \u201cSo this isn\u2019t just about \u2018Cookout Beckie\u2019. This is a pattern. And this isn\u2019t about conservatives vs. liberals either. As we\u2019ve often reported (and so did Martin Luther King Jr. before us), white liberals are just as problematic as conservatives.\u201d \n \n Otis Taylor Jr. wrote for the San Francisco Chronicle, \u201cThe first time I saw the video of a white woman on the phone with police because two black men were using a charcoal grill at Lake Merritt, I thought it was a parody, a provocative satire on race in America. But, no, this is America, a country where a black person must be prepared for the possibility that police might be called to investigate and indict their blackness.\u201d \n \n 3. Schulte Has a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering From Stanford, but the University Says She Does Not Work There, Disputing Reports That She Is a Professor \n \n The 41-year-old Jennifer Schulte, whose name has been in some reports misspelled Jennifer Shulte, graduated from Stanford University in 2006 with a Ph.D in chemical engineering, according to her now-deleted Linkedin profile. That detail and her use of the name Dr. Jennifer Schulte on social media has led some to believe she is a professor or otherwise employed by Stanford. \n \n But the California university distanced itself from her on Twitter, writing, \u201cAccording to our records, a person by this name earned graduate degrees at Stanford more than a decade ago. She is not employed as staff or as a faculty member.\u201d An entry on a Stanford website shows that she was part of the James Swartz Research Group in the chemical engineering and bioengineering department. \n \n Schulte is a North Dakota native and attended the University of North Dakota for her undergraduate degree in chemical engineering. She has lived in Oakland since 2006. \n \n 4. She Works as an Air Quality & Climate Change Specialist \n \n Schulte works as a senior project manager at an environmental resources and services company in Oakland, according to her Linkedin profile. Her work focuses on air quality. She is also a climate change technical specialist. She previously worked at Horizon Water and Environment, URS Corporation and Environ International Corporation. \n \n An announcement for a 2016 meeting of the American Petroleum Institute shows that Schulte gave a talk titled \u201cOEHHA Revised Risk Assessment Methods: Developing a Facility Game Plan\u201d for the organization. \u201cDr. Jennifer Schulte is a Senior Project Manager with ERM based in Walnut Creek, California. She has 10 years of experience as an air quality and climate change specialist, and is a recognized expert in the fields of air quality, emission estimation, air dispersion modeling, health risk assessments, and climate change impacts,\u201d the website said. \u201cDr. Schulte has conducted complex projects throughout California, the United States, and some international locations involving air emission inventories, air dispersion modeling, health risk assessments, and climate change analyses for numerous clients including commercial and residential development projects, ports, transportation, refineries, and various other industrial areas. She conducts air quality and climate change analyses for regulatory compliance, environmental studies required for CEQA and NEPA, and litigation support.\u201d \n \n The Irvine, California, city website shows that she was part of a team that prepared a supplemental environmental impact report as part of a city project. \n \n 5. Oakland Residents Held a Large Cookout & Spoke Out About It at a City Hall Meeting \n \n How Black Oakland responds to a white lady calling the cops on Black folks BBQing\u2026 pic.twitter.com/kRdJpnmXQ2 \u2014 Brotha B (@BlakeDontCrack) May 11, 2018 \n \n Oakland residents responded to the viral video by holding a large cookout in the area where the incident occurred. A huge crowd showed up for the barbecue at Lake Merritt on May 10. \u201cThis how we feel about mad a** Oakland gentrifiers,\u201d Michael Swanson Jr. said in a video from the party. \n \n Residents also spoke out at a recent city council meeting: \n \n \u201cThe assault on black life is not an isolated set of circumstances,\u201d activist Carroll Fife told the council, according to Mother Jones. \u201cThe recent emergency phone call from Jennifer S\u201d\u2014the name of a woman identified on Twitter as the caller, but whose identity remains unconfirmed\u2014\u201da white woman angered by an African American family barbecuing in an unauthorized location at Lake Merritt, highlights how anti-black racism is used in a way to control black bodies and used in a way to control space.\u201d \n \n She added, \u201cWe don\u2019t want any more apologies. We don\u2019t want any more business cards. We don\u2019t want any more forums. What we want is you all to take note and take account.\u201d \n \n City Councilmember Lynette Gibson McElhaney told HuffPost, \u201cIn a city that needs significant policing services, we can\u2019t have those precious expensive resources squandered in a frivolous way. Police are not private security for any white person that\u2019s offended by the presence of black folks in our public spaces.\u201d ||||| St. Johns County deputies were called on a father during a teenage recreation soccer league game in Ponte Vedra over the weekend. \n \n A witness named Ginger Williams recorded some of the incident on her cell phone and posted it to her Facebook page headlining it \"SOCCER WHILE BLACK.\" She also dubbed the field marshal who called the police \"Golfcart Gail\" because she approached the father while riding in a golf cart. \n \n UPDATE: New video shows Ponte Vedra's 'Golfcart Gail' calling police on soccer dad during child's game \n \n Williams said the father was only speaking to his son about a call the ref made and when he attempted to leave to diffuse the situation, the field marshal called police. \n \n Williams' Facebook post continues to spread with people alleging that this is yet another case in a disturbing national trend of people trying to weaponize police against a person of color. \n \n Gary Easom, president of the Ponte Vedra Athletic Association, said the incident is being mischaracterized on social media and is more about parents behaving badly while watching their child play soccer. \n \n Sign up for the GMJ On the Go Thanks for signing up!

Williams' Sunday Facebook post\u2014titled \"Soccer While Black\"\u2014shows a pic of the unnamed woman, on her phone in a golf cart, allegedly making a call about a man Williams says was simply shouting out instructions to his son. The dad simply \"yelled 'The ref is right' when he saw his kid out there getting frustrated after a call,\" Williams notes. That apparently set \"Gail\" off, and she told the dad \"harassment won't be tolerated\" and \"continued to harass and beleaguer him.\" NBC News explains talking to the ref in a game isn't permitted, but Williams writes the man explained he was talking to his own son. He finally offered to just leave to defuse the situation, Williams adds, at which point \"Golfcart Gail\" said she was still calling the cops \"because she no longer felt safe with his threatening behavior.\" (NBC News also has some video.) A rep for the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office says the woman in the golf cart is an athletic association field marshal, and the head of that group says the cops were called not just because of that dad, \"but as a result of a culmination of several immediate prior incidents\" at the game, including a mom who was cursing and another dad who'd been ejected for being verbally abusive, per WTLV.

Security Council as an illogical, unjust and defunct relic of the past used by the United States \"to impose its bullying manner on the world\". \n \n \"They (Americans) talk of human rights when what they mean is Western interests. They talk of democracy when what they have is military intervention in other countries,\" he added. \n \n (Reporting by Marcus George, Zahra Hosseinian and Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by Alistair Lyon) ||||| The U.N. chief jolted his Iranian hosts for a nonaligned nations meeting Wednesday by pointing out \"serious concerns\" in Tehran's human rights record and urging cooperation with the world body to improve freedoms. \n \n Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, second right, reviews an honor guard, as he is welcomed by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, right, for their meeting in Tehran, Iran, Wednesday, Aug. 29, 2012....

Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon, left, talks with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, right, during their meeting... (Associated Press) \n \n U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had signaled he would not shy away from criticism of Iran during his visit to the Nonaligned Movement gathering in Tehran, but the sharp comments appeared to catch Iranian officials off guard just hours after his arrival. \n \n \"We have discussed how United Nations can work together with Iran to improve the human rights situation in Iran. We have our serious concerns on the human rights abuses and violations in this country,\" he told a news conference as he sat next to Iran's Parliament Speaker Ali Larijani, who frowned at the remarks. \n \n Iran's opposition groups had urged Ban to use his appearance in Tehran as a platform to criticize Iran's ruling system over its crackdowns on political dissent, including the house arrests of opposition leaders Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mahdi Karroubi. \n \n While in Tehran, Ban also could raise sensitive issues such as demands by U.N. nuclear inspectors for wider access to various sites, including a military base near Tehran suspected of being a proving ground for explosives experiments that could be used to test nuclear triggers. Iran denies it seeks nuclear arms, but Western nations and allies fear Tehran's uranium enrichment labs are moving close to warhead-grade material. \n \n U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said in his talks, Ban expressed frustration that `'little tangible progress\" has been made in talks between Iran and world powers over Tehran's nuclear program. No date has been set to resume negotiations after several rounds over the past months. \n \n Iran says it wants talks to continue, but also claims that the current gathering in Tehran shows that Western efforts to isolate Iran have failed. \n \n In Vienna, the U.N.'s nuclear agency has created a special Iran Task Force of nuclear weapons experts, intelligence analysts and other specialists focused on probing Tehran's atomic program, according to an internal document shared with The Associated Press. \n \n Iran is seeking to use the weeklong meeting of the 120-nation Nonaligned Movement to promote its position that its nuclear program is peaceful and its uranium enrichment is within the U.N. treaty rules. The meetings are capped by a two-day summit that begins Thursday. \n \n Ban's visit is being interpreted by Iranian media as a blow to Western attempts to isolate the Islamic republic in defiance of Israeli and American calls to boycott the meeting. \n \n Tehran is also seeking to win support from the nonaligned bloc, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the U.N. member states, for its nuclear program. A visit to Natanz uranium enrichment site in central Iran by participating leaders has not been ruled out. \n \n Ban met Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad later Wednesday. \n \n Khamenei called on him to take action over Israel's nuclear weapons, according to Khamenei's website, calling this \"a big danger to the region.\" Israel has never acknowledged having nuclear weapons but is widely believed to have a large arsenal. \n \n In advance, Ban also said he would discuss the Syria crisis with Iranian leaders, who remain staunch allies of Bashar Assad's regime. The U.N. chief has in the past called Iran a major player capable of mediating in regional conflicts, including Syria's civil war. \n \n Nesirky, the U.N. spokesman, said that in his meetings in Tehran Ban \"urged the leadership _ the president, the Supreme Leader, the speaker of parliament _ to really reach out to the Syrian leadership and impress on them the really urgent need to stop the violence and to create the conditions that are necessary for a political process.\" \n \n Iran plans to propose the formation of a three-member nonaligned team, plus two neighbors of Syria, to help resolve the crisis there, Iran's state media quoted prominent lawmaker Alaeddin Boroujerdi as saying. \n \n The proposed troika will include Egypt, Iran and Venezuela plus Iraq and Lebanon. Boroujerdi, who met Assad during a visit to Syria last week, said the Syrian president said he would welcome the Iranian plan. \n \n Khamenei told Ban that the solution is to stop weapons shipments to the Syrian rebels, or as he put it, \"irresponsible groups inside Syria,\" according to his website. \n \n A senior Iranian official gave details of the plan Iran is proposing at the summit. \n \n \"Iran's proposal ... is a cease-fire and the implementation of a three-month mechanism for national reconciliation talks in this country,\" the official IRNA news agency quoted Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian as saying Wednesday. \n \n Anti-regime fighters have dismissed any role for Iran in such a plan. The rebels and some others say it has little hope of succeeding. Also, the United States has rejected Iranian participation in international meetings on the Syrian crisis. \n \n In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland urged Ban to press Iran over Syria. She said Iran does have a role to play: \"It can break with the Assad regime and stop providing material support and arms and advisers and all of these kinds of things,\" she said. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Edith M. Lederer contributed to this report from the United Nations. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mohammed Mursi's comments will \"really have hurt\", the BBC's Jon Leyne says \n \n Egypt's president has told a summit of the Non-Aligned Movement (Nam) that the Syrian uprising is a \"revolution against an oppressive regime\". \n \n Mohammed Mursi, making the first visit to Iran by an Egyptian leader since 1979, said the movement had an \"ethical duty\" to support the uprising. \n \n His comments sparked a walkout by the Syrian delegation. \n \n Syria's Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said Mr Mursi's speech \"incites continued bloodshed in Syria\". \n \n Egypt has been holding the rotating Nam presidency and Mr Mursi was handing the duty over to Iran during his visit. \n \n He used his speech to tell delegates of the 120-member body: \"Our solidarity with the struggle of the Syrian people against an oppressive regime that has lost its legitimacy is an ethical duty, as it is a political and strategic necessity. \n \n Analysis President Mursi's speech in Tehran marks an important moment as he defines Egypt's new foreign policy. The new Egyptian leader has defied Washington, by going to Tehran for the Non-Aligned summit. Now he has angered the Iranian government by criticising their allies, the Syrian regime. The message is clear. Egypt intends to have a new, independent and assertive foreign policy. It is a huge contrast from the days of President Hosni Mubarak who was seen, by many Egyptians, as slavishly following the Americans. But it will also provide some reassurance to Washington, showing there is not about to be a new \"Islamic axis\" between the Muslim Brotherhood-led government of Egypt and the Islamic Republic of Iran. \n \n \"We all have to announce our full solidarity with the struggle of those seeking freedom and justice in Syria, and translate this sympathy into a clear political vision that supports a peaceful transition to a democratic system of rule that reflects the demands of the Syrian people for freedom.\" \n \n He compared the anti-government movement in Syria to the Palestinians, saying they were both \"actively seeking freedom, dignity and human justice\", and said Egypt was \"ready to work with all to stop the bloodshed\". \n \n The BBC's Iran correspondent, James Reynolds, says Tehran's hope for the summit was to show the West the Islamic Republic had plenty of friends elsewhere, but Mr Mursi's comments would certainly have upset the hosts. \n \n However, he says not everyone in Iran would have noticed, as one Iranian state TV channel mistranslated Mr Mursi's words into Persian, giving the impression that president was actually speaking in support of the Syrian government. \n \n Syria's delegation walked out of the conference room when Mr Mursi began speaking, Egyptian and Syrian media reported. Iranian media said they had simply left to conduct an interview. \n \n Mr Muallem said Mr Mursi's comments \"violated the traditions of the summit and are considered interference in Syrian internal affairs\". \n \n He accused Mr Mursi of \"inciting continued bloodshed in Syria\". \n \n Syria's exit illustrates the strong divisions that are likely to overshadow or even dominate this summit Read more from James \n \n Mr Mursi's visit was the first by an Egyptian leader to Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, when Iran cut ties with President Anwar Sadat's administration over its signing of a peace treaty with Israel. \n \n After his speech, Mr Mursi met Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. \n \n Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Amir Abdollahian said the presidents had discussed bilateral ties and \"emphasised the need to solve the Syria crisis via diplomacy and to prevent foreign intervention\". \n \n Mr Mursi left Tehran shortly afterwards, Iranian media said. \n \n 'Serious concerns' \n \n UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who is attending the summit, said Syria was facing a long-term civil war, and warned that \"those who provide arms to either side in Syria are contributing to the misery\". \n \n \"The situation cannot be resolved with the blood and the bodies of more than 18,000 people and counting. There should be no more bullets and bombs.

Last year residents spent a whopping 114 days breathing air that contained levels of polluting particulates above safe levels. \n \n To put that into perspective, the citizens of Milan, Lombardy's industrial capital, spent 86 days breathing unsafe air. So what's polluting San Vitaliano? A new ordinance from the mayor's office blames its innumerable pizzerias. \n \n Convinced that the traditional wood-burning pizza stoves are clogging up the lungs of his citizens, Mayor Antonio Falcone has decided to outlaw them as a precautionary measure. \n \n SEE ALSO: Ten bizarre but tempting non-Italian pizzas \n \n \u201cAs of today, in spite of several tests carried out by the environment agency, Arpac, we are still unsure of the cause of the pollution,\u201d wrote the mayor. \u201cBut the situation has got worse during the winter and we need to take maximum precautions to ensure the problem doesn't deteriorate. \n \n \u201cAgricultural, artisanal, industrial and commercial producers are hereby forbidden from burning solid biomass such as wood, woodchips, coal and charcoal. The only exceptions are for those which have filter systems in place that will guarantee the elimination of 80 percent of all polluting Pm10 particulates.\u201d \n \n Story continues below\u2026 \n \n The new legislation came into force on December 17th and will apply until June 30th next year. The measures will cease to be active over the summer months but will come into force again in October 2016. \n \n \n \n The move will cause the town's many pizzerias and artisanal bakeries to change their fuel sources or install costly filters to reduce pollution \u2013 a fact which has angered local business owners. \n \n \n \n Those caught breaking the ban will face fines of between \u20ac200 and \u20ac1,032. \n \n \u201cShocking, it's so ridiculous. They don't want us to make pizza?\u201d Massimilliano Arichello of the locally famous pizzeria Taverna 191 told local paper Il Mattino. \n \n \n \n \u201cWe make about 34 pizzas a day, how do they think we are responsible for the pollution problems around here?\u201d ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Pizza-making is one of the factors that have made St Vitaliano one of the worst-polluted towns in Italy \n \n A town in Italy has imposed a temporary ban on the traditional way of pizza-making as a measure to curb soaring pollution. \n \n An edict issued by the mayor of San Vitaliano, just outside of Naples, bans the use of wood-fired stoves in bakeries and eateries including pizzerias unless their owners install special filters to reduce air pollution. \n \n The measure has been prompted by \"utmost concern\" over worsening air quality, and will stay in place until 31 March. It can be reintroduced later if the new filtering systems prove ineffective. \n \n The ban will be enforced by police checks, and those found in breach of the mayor's order will face fines of up to 1,032 euros (\u00a3760, $1,130). \n \n Bad air quality is a longstanding problem for San Vitaliano. According to Il Mattino newspaper, it is more polluted than Beijing, while nearby Naples - usually seen as one of Italy's worst offenders in terms of air quality - seems like \"a perfumed garden\" in comparison. In 2015, San Vitaliano exceeded the threshold for emissions 114 times, compared to 86 times in Milan, another badly polluted Italian city, the paper says. \n \n But not everyone is convinced that pizza-making is the true culprit. Local residents and pizza makers held a protest on Sunday in front of the town hall against the mayor's order. \"We can't be the cause of the smog,\" said one, according a report in Corriere della Sera. \"Naples has many more pizzerias than San Vitaliano but doesn't have the same pollution levels.

    "document": "As you may know, on late Sunday evening, while riding the train in Oakland, a white man targeted two young Black women on the train, without ever saying a word to them, and killed one \u2013 a beautiful young soul named Nia Wilson, an 18 year old high school student, and critically injured her sister \u2013 stabbing and slashing them both with a knife \u2013 then simply walking away. \n \n I spent all day yesterday doing everything I could to make this story into national news and was prepared this morning to come on and talk about how we needed to work harder to find Nia\u2019s killer, but I am glad to report that at about 6pm West Coast time, John Lee Cowell, a brutal man with a history of violence across his entire life, was arrested and charged with Nia\u2019s murder. \n \n I wanna comment on a few things about this case that grieve me. \n \n Nia Wilson, above all, was a teenage girl. She was a high school senior \u2013 the exact same age of my oldest daughter. And yesterday, after just a few hours of sharing her story, I saw something truly sick starting to unfold. First, a local news station in the Bay Area shared an image of Nia holding what looked like a gun. Why did they share that image? What were they trying to convey? And, as it turns out, she wasn\u2019t holding a gun in that image, it was a cell phone case with a gun handle. It was a basically a gag \u2013 and the local news showed it like it said something about Nia\u2019s character. She literally posted nearly 1,000 wonderful photos of her life on Instagram and Facebook, and they chose that one. \n \n Even in death, local news media finds a way to demean us. It\u2019s why I believe so much in having our own outlets, our own platforms, our own morning shows, where we define our own stories and narratives without that type of ugliness. \n \n Secondly, last night in Oakland thousands of people, including members of Nia\u2019s own family, showed up to her outdoor vigil. Now I don\u2019t need to explain this to our listeners, but this was a moment of pain, and grief, and support. And white supremacists from the group Proud Boys, wearing red Make American Great Again hats, literally showed up to interrupt the vigil. \n \n Let me pause right here for a moment. \n \n Never \u2013 in the entire history of this country \u2013 will you find an example of white people coming together to grieve the brutal murder of their loved one \u2013 the day after it happened \u2013 only to have their grief physically interrupted by belligerent Black folk telling them that they are worthless. It\u2019s never happened. It never will happen. \n \n How cruel, how evil, how heartless, how crass, how foul do you have to be, how rotten must you be from the inside out, how dry and dead must your soul be \u2013 to have the idea that you want to interrupt grieving people and demean them the day after their loved one was murdered? \n \n I wanna linger here for a moment because I think it gives us a real glimpse into the sick psychology of exactly who we are dealing with and fighting against. They interrupt our grief because they don\u2019t even really see us as fully human. \n \n Let me close with this final thought. \n \n This morning I saw the video of the arrest of John Lee Cowell. Police don\u2019t draw their guns. They don\u2019t slam him to the concrete and put their knees into his back while putting on his handcuffs. They don\u2019t Taser him. They don\u2019t choke him. \n \n You\u2019d think they were arresting a man for writing a bad check or stealing a shirt from a department store. \n \n And so often after we see a horrible incident of police brutality against Black folk, we talk about how American police need more training and better training. I\u2019ve said that myself, but police show us over and over and over again \u2013 with white men who are considered armed and dangerous \u2013 who\u2019ve just brutally murdered people \u2013 that they are fully willing and able to remain calm, and cool, and collected, and methodical \u2013 whenever they feel like it. \n \n All these years we thought they needed to be trained on how to make a peaceful arrest \u2013 and it turns out they\u2019re great at it \u2013 even with the most vicious and violent murderers \u2013 if they\u2019re white. \n \n We\u2019re not saying that the police should\u2019ve beaten or choked or shot or maimed or Tasered this man, we\u2019re saying that we want unarmed, non-violent Black folk to get the same treatment American police are so willing able to give dangerous white murderers. ||||| Viewers of local Oakland news station KTVU are expressing outrage after the station used a photo of slain teen Nia Wilson holding what appears to be a gun during a broadcast about her murder. \n \n On Sunday night, 18-year-old Wilson died after she and her sister, 26-year-old Lahtifa Wilson, were stabbed in the neck by 27-year-old suspect John Lee Cowell while they were attempting to get onto a BART train. Her sister was hospitalized overnight, and after a day-long manhunt, BART police arrested Cowell on Monday evening, according to SFGate. So far, the stabbings have been characterized as \u201crandom,\u201d though police haven\u2019t eliminated the idea that the crime was racially motivated. \n \n Across social media, critics of the news station have shared snapshots of the broadcast\u2019s use of the photo. It seems the photo is from Wilson\u2019s Facebook page, where she has posted tens of other photos that news outlets could have used for stories regarding her death. \n \n Fuck you @KTVU this is beyond unethical.

I'm certain you had plenty to choose from of the slain 18-year old Oakland teen? Why this picture of her holding a (fake) gun? We'd like to know. pic.twitter.com/W4SHhERGOK \u2014 Khaled Beydoun (@KhaledBeydoun) July 24, 2018 \n \n Many have bashed the station for depicting Wilson, the victim of a murder, in a way that characterizes her as a troublemaker or a criminal, contributing to the narrative that Black people who are victims of violence are \u201cdeserving\u201d of violence, or \u201ccontributing\u201d to the violence against themselves. \n \n \u201cWhy did they share that image?

It was a [sic] basically a gag\u2014and the local news showed it like it said something about Nia\u2019s character. She literally posted nearly 1,000 wonderful photos of her life on Instagram and Facebook, and they chose that one,\u201d writer Shaun King, who has boosted Wilson\u2019s story throughout the search for her murderer, wrote on Facebook. \u201cEven in death, local news media finds a way to demean us. It\u2019s why I believe so much in having our own outlets, our own platforms, our own morning shows, where we define our own stories and narratives without that type of ugliness.\u201d \n \n In previous high-profile murders of Black teenagers, such as Trayvon Martin and the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, the media used photos that portrayed the teens negatively. Some 2012 stories of Martin showed photos of him wearing a hoodie, smoking, wearing a grill, or raising his middle fingers. In 2014, images of Brown showed him holding a peace sign, which some tried to characterize as a gang sign. After garnering criticism, publications later began showing a high school graduation photo of Brown in his cap, gown, and graduation stole. \n \n At the time, critics used the hashtag #IfTheyGunnedMeDown to ask which photo the media would use if they were to be murdered, providing options such as graduation photos or employment headshots, and party photos. People using the hashtag made the point that regardless of how they seem in a \u201cparty photo,\u201d they were still the same accomplished person depicted in the other pictures. \n \n In response to KTVU\u2019s use of the photo, the hashtag has also been revived. \n \n This is the literal reason that #IfTheyGunnedMeDown was created\u2026 as many pictures as there are of #NiaWilson that @KTVU would choose to use this photo of the VICTIM is not only irresponsible- it\u2019s malicious, it\u2019s cold- it\u2019s what we\u2019ve come to expect with black lives & media. https://t.co/OXGq2lAWM2 \u2014 C.J. Lawrence (@CJLawrenceEsq) July 24, 2018 \n \n KTVU anchor Frank Somerville shared an apology to his Facebook page on Monday afternoon, about four hours after the broadcast, stating there was \u201cno excuse\u201d for the station to use that photo of Wilson, and that it was a \u201chuge mistake\u201d that the staff is \u201cmortified by.\u201d Somerville included three other photos of Wilson in his post. \n \n \u201cWe NEVER should have used that picture. It was a huge mistake on our part. We realized it instantly. And that picture will NEVER appear on our air again. We had a lot of pictures to choose from and unfortunately that was one of the ones we used. Again there was no excuse for that. And my belief is that when you make a mistake you own up to it. And that was our mistake. A big mistake,\u201d Somerville wrote. \u201cNia was a beautiful young girl. She had her whole life ahead of her. From me, and all of us at KTVU, I can\u2019t say enough how sorry we are.\u201d \n \n (A KTVU newsroom staff member forwarded along the Daily Dot\u2019s request for comment and referenced Somerville\u2019s post for the time being. Somerville also addressed the photo on KTVU\u2019s evening broadcast.) \n \n I wanted to take a moment and apologize for a picture that KTVU showed on the air for several seconds today about the\u2026 Posted by Frank Somerville KTVU on Monday, July 23, 2018 \n \n Somerville\u2019s post has been shared 2,500 times and has received nearly 5,000 reactions. Many readers rejected his apology, writing that the damage had already been done. Some asserted that the use of imagery depicting Black victims and victims of color is used far too often, showing that the use of Wilson\u2019s photo wasn\u2019t a mistake as much as it was a conscious, oft-made decision. \n \n \u201cThis girl senselessly lost her life to a lunatic and you (the media), turned her into a suspect in her own death by using that picture\u2026.and took the focus off of the animal that actually did it. That\u2019s what the media ALWAYS does to victims of color,\u201d commenter Patricia Lyn Butler wrote. \n \n \u201cThis happens all too frequently and it\u2019s difficult to believe that no one in the newsroom took notice that this was not an appropriate photo for this story. If an error like this can be made, then there needs to be some significant and swift changes at KTVU,\u201d another commenter, LaTanya McNeil-Jones, wrote. \n \n KTVU also came under fire in 2013 when they ran fake, offensive names of pilots involved in the crash of Asiana Flight 214 at the San Francisco International Airport. At least three veteran producers were fired after alleging the pilots names were \u201cCapt. Sum Ting Wong, Wi Tu Lo, Ho Lee Fuk, and Bang Ding Ow,\u201d SFGate reported at the time. \n \n The evening after her murder, Oakland residents hosted a \u201cSay Her Name\u201d vigil and march at the MacArthur BART Station in Wilson\u2019s honor.

Police have framed the attack as random, though many have speculated over whether there was racial motivation involved. And in the aftermath of Nia's death, a national conversation has emerged around race that has reeled in some big-name celebs and brought a thoughtful post from Anne Hathaway that's generating headlines. The timeline: Outrage erupted and F-bombs got lobbed over Oakland news station KTVU's coverage of Wilson's death. Its report featured a photo of Wilson from her Facebook page; in it, she appears to be holding a gun.

Many said the choice fueled a larger trend involving the criminalization of black victims. And it wasn't even a gun.

    "document": "One staple of a Michele Bachmann campaign event is blaring Elvis Presley music. Another is a reference to her intent to make Barack Obama a one-term president. Increasingly, there is a third feature of a Bachmann appearance on the presidential trail: a staffer\u2019s physical confrontation with a reporter. \n \n In less than two months since entering the 2012 race, Bachmann\u2019s campaign staff has become embroiled in at least five unusually hostile encounters with the traveling media marked by pushing, shoving and, in one instance, the allegation of a threat of violence to a reporter. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Allen on Bachmann security POLITICO 44 \n \n Some of it has unfolded in full public view: Bachmann aides\u2019 tussles with the press have twice turned into news stories, once when veteran ABC News reporter Brian Ross was shoved and pushed by Bachmann staffers in South Carolina and on a second occasion when Bachmann\u2019s husband and two staffers pushed CNN\u2019s Don Lemon into a cart, producing a furious on-air complaint. \n \n In another incident that did not make the air, a camera captured Fox News correspondent Steve Brown telling a bodyguard in Iowa, \u201cDo not put your hands on me. Don\u2019t ever do it again.\u201d \n \n A foreign reporter also alleged to POLITICO this week that an aide threatened to break his arm \u2014 an allegation the Bachmann campaign denied. \n \n Friction between the press and high-profile politicians and celebrities is nothing new. But the number and intensity of incidents is unusual, particularly in Iowa, where reporters and the public are accustomed to almost unlimited access as an early state presidential ritual. \n \n The campaign makes no apologies for its physically aggressive approach to media management, asserting that it is simply doing what it has to do to protect a popular, controversial candidate. The most aggressive aide \u2014 a tall, silver-haired man according to reporters \u2014 a spokeswoman said, is a former Secret Service agent who has guarded presidents. He and an advance woman frequently make physical contact with reporters. \n \n \u201cThe No. 1 priority for us every single day we step out on the campaign trail is the safety and security of Michele Bachmann,\u201d said her spokeswoman, Alice Stewart. \n \n The retired Secret Service agent, whom she declined to name, is \u201cextremely professional.\u201d \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s guarded presidents and vice presidents and knows exactly what needs to be done,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen he gives a warning to whoever it may be, the person needs to heed the warning.\u201d \n \n The conduct seems authentically motivated by security concerns for the popular grass-roots candidate, who tends to draw enthusiastic crowds. But the Minnesota congresswoman isn\u2019t the first celebrity-like figure to run for president, or the biggest. And the contentious encounters with the press has far oustripped that of other high-profile campaigns. Security guards for high-profile candidates like Rudy Giuliani, Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin were better able to distinguish between reporters and threats. \n \n The difference was sharply visible over the past week at the Iowa State Fair. Palin wandered the fairgrounds freely with her husband, an advance man, and, at a remove, a handful of Iowa State Police. Rick Perry was guarded by watchful Texas Rangers who gave the press and fair-goers broad latitude to talk and walk next to the governor. Bachmann, in contrast, raced through the fair in a golf cart; in a similar cart in Ames on Saturday, her bodyguard could be seen pushing away the hands of autograph-seeking supporters. \n \n The reporter alleging that a warning crossed over into a threat is a Norwegian correspondent, Are Tagvold Flaten, who is in Iowa on a grant from the Oslo-based Freedom of Expression Foundation. He is covering the race for a Norwegian website about American politics and also wrote about the Ames Straw Poll for the conservative Norwegian Web journal Minerva (recently in the news for its editor\u2019s pained consideration of the fact that the mass murderer Anders Breivik was among the site\u2019s commenters). ||||| Kathy Griffin has, over the past few years, been a persistent thorn in the side of the Palin family, pulling public stunts, taking out Levi Johnston to events and making jokes about Sarah and Bristol a regular part of her stand-up repertoire. Now, with a new religious ultraconservative woman taking the spotlight, the comedienne has a new target in her sights. \n \n Appearing on \"Conan\" Monday night, Griffin recalled the time she met Bachmann in Washington while researching for her rally to repeal Don't Ask, Don't Tell. \n \n Perhaps mistaking Griffin for someone else, one of Bachmann's staffers pulled out a video camera to capture their interaction for her website. First, Griffin says she asked the Congresswoman if she'd support an effort to repeal the law that banned homosexuals from the military. When Bachmann declined, Griffin got personal. \n \n \"Congresswoman Bachmann, were you born a bigot or did you, like, grow into it?\" she asked -- on tape. \n \n As for Bachmann's answer? \n \n \"That's a good question. I'm gonna have to get back to ya,\" she said, perhaps not creating the best of campaign slogans. \n \n WATCH:",

Bachmann's campaign says security is just doing what it needs to keep their candidate safe, but veteran reporters say her security is going too far, well beyond the norms for bigger and more controversial candidates' security.

    "document": "What separates us from other primates? \n \n The psychologists behind a new MRI study say it is key components in the ventrolateral frontal cortex area of the human brain, and how these components were connected up with other brain areas. When compared to equivalent MRI data from 25 macaque monkeys, the authors determined that it is unlike anything in the brains of some of our closest evolutionary relatives. \n \n The ventrolateral frontal cortex area of the brain is involved in many of the highest aspects of cognition and language, and is only present in humans and other primates. Some parts are implicated in psychiatric conditions like ADHD, drug addiction or compulsive behavior disorders. Language is affected when other parts are damaged after stroke or neurodegenerative disease. A better understanding of the neural connections and networks involved should help the understanding of changes in the brain that go along with these conditions. \n \n \"We tend to think that being able to plan into the future, be flexible in our approach and learn from others are things that are particularly impressive about humans. We've identified an area of the brain that appears to be uniquely human and is likely to have something to do with these cognitive powers,\" says senior researcher Professor Matthew Rushworth of Oxford University's Department of Experimental Psychology.The brain is a mosaic of interlinked areas. We wanted to look at this very important region of the frontal part of the brain and see how many tiles there are and where they are placed. \n \n \"We also looked at the connections of each tile \u2013 how they are wired up to the rest of the brain \u2013 as it is these connections that determine the information that can reach that component part and the influence that part can have on other brain regions.\" \n \n From the MRI data, the researchers were able to divide the human ventrolateral frontal cortex into 12 areas that were consistent across all the individuals. \n \n \"Each of these 12 areas has its own pattern of connections with the rest of the brain, a sort of \"neural fingerprint\", telling us it is doing something unique,\" says Professor Rushworth. \n \n The researchers were then able to compare the 12 areas in the human brain region with the organization of the monkey prefrontal cortex. Overall, they were very similar with 11 of the 12 areas being found in both species and being connected up to other brain areas in very similar ways. \n \n However, one area of the human ventrolateral frontal cortex had no equivalent in the macaque \u2013 an area called the lateral frontal pole prefrontal cortex. \n \n \"We have established an area in human frontal cortex which does not seem to have an equivalent in the monkey at all,' says first author Franz-Xaver Neubert of Oxford University. 'This area has been identified with strategic planning and decision making as well as \"multi-tasking\".\" \n \n The Oxford research group also found that the auditory parts of the brain were very well connected with the human prefrontal cortex, but much less so in the macaque. The researchers suggest this may be critical for our ability to understand and generate speech. \n \n Published in Neuron. Source: University of Oxford ||||| Ball of tissue named lateral frontal pole found to be crucial in analysing alternative decisions \u2013 and may be unique to humans \n \n A new brain region that appears to help humans identify whether they have made bad decisions has been discovered by researchers. \n \n The size and shape of a large Brussels sprout, the ball of neural tissue seems to be crucial for the kind of flexible thought that allows us to consider switching to a more promising course of action. \n \n While other brain parts keep track of how well, or not, our decisions are working for us, the new structure is more outward-looking, and mulls over what we might have done instead. \n \n Scientists spotted the region, named the lateral frontal pole, after scanning the brains of healthy humans in two different ways. Further scans failed to find any comparable region in monkeys, suggesting the area is exclusive to humans. \n \n \"We know there are differences between humans and monkeys. But it is surprising how many similarities there can be, and how a couple of differences can mean our behaviour is so far removed from them,\" said Matthew Rushworth, a professor of cognitive neuroscience, who led the study at Oxford University. \n \n \"There are a few brain areas that monitor how good our choices are, and that is a very sensible thing to have. But this region monitors how good the choices are that we didn't take. It tells us how green the grass is on the other side of the fence.\" \n \n The remarkable finding highlights how much scientists have to learn about the human brain and how cutting-edge lab techniques are redrawing the map of the most complex organ in the known universe. \n \n One expert who spoke to the Guardian said the work was \"stunning\" and could pave the way for fresh advances in understanding psychiatric diseases. Details of the work are published in the Neuron journal. \n \n The Oxford team recruited 25 healthy people for the study and scanned each person twice. One scan, called diffusion-weighted MRI, revealed the neural pathways that connect different parts of the brain. The other, called functional MRI (fMRI), showed which areas of the brain were most active when the patients were resting. \n \n The combination of scans allowed the scientists to work out in exquisite detail how each part of the ventrolateral frontal cortex (vlFC), a region crucial for language and cognitive flexibility, was connected with any other part of the brain. From this, they identified 12 distinct areas of the vlFC that worked in different ways. \n \n For the next stage of the study, the researchers took fMRI scans of the ventrolateral frontal cortex in macaques. These revealed 11 regions that closely matched those seen in humans. But the lateral frontal pole was missing. Humans have two, one above and behind each eyebrow. \n \n \"It might seem a bit pointless, but one of the ways to do something effectively is to monitor the other ways you could be doing something. People who have a bigger signal in this area are better at switching tack,\" said Rushworth. \n \n Overall, the brain scans from humans and monkeys showed remarkable similarities. But another key difference was seen in the auditory areas of the brain. In humans, parts of the brain that help us understand spoken words were strongly connected to the vlFC. In monkeys, the same areas were connected to the part of the brain that deals with social and emotional responses. The difference may go some way to explaining why humans speak and monkeys don't. \n \n \"This is stunning work,\" said Karl Zilles, a neuroscientist at the Institute for Neuroscience and Medicine in J\u00fclich, Germany. \"It is the first time that modern MRI techniques have been combined to study differences in these parts of the brain in monkeys and humans.\" \n \n \"I am quite sure that this will turn out to be of great importance in studying psychiatric disease. What we understand now is the connectivity within the brain. We know the cables and the connections. What we have to do now is combine all this with how information is processed in the different brain areas,\" he added.",

That mission is accomplished. What girls need now is encouragement to become leaders. It's time to take them to the C-suite, where the corporate chiefs work. \n \n Hewlett Packard CEO and President Meg Whitman smiles as she speaks at a conference on the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto, Calif. on March 9. Op-ed contributor Jennifer Allyn argues: 'Girls no longer need help picturing themselves in a job; what they do need is encouragement to become leaders.' \n \n Today marks the 20th anniversary of Take Our Daughters to Work Day. The event, which now includes our sons too, is still a valuable chance to help children understand the workplace. But the problems that face girls and women have changed in the past two decades, and it\u2019s time for the day\u2019s emphasis to change, too. \n \n What we need now is Take Our Daughters to the C-Suite Day \u2013 the offices occupied by corporate \"chiefs.\" \n \n Twenty years ago, the Ms. Foundation launched the program to demystify the workplace for girls and inspire them to embrace a wide range of careers. Now that women represent half the US workforce, we can fairly say that mission has been accomplished. \n \n Girls no longer need help picturing themselves in a job; what they do need is encouragement to become leaders. In Fortune 500 companies, women make up just 3.6 percent of CEOs, 14 percent of executive officers, and 16 percent of board directors. Companies need to do much more to inspire women to lead, rather than blaming the lack of women leaders on what Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg calls an \u201cambition gap.\u201d \n \n Companies that are already committing time and resources to Take Our Children to Work Day can help close that gap by shifting their focus in three ways: introducing girls to female role models; more clearly explaining what leaders of both genders actually do; and supporting programs throughout the year that actively identify and groom female talent. \n \n Introducing girls to a company\u2019s highest ranking women is an easy step any organization can add to their career day programs \u2013 and it\u2019s one that can make a huge difference. Marie Wilson, founder of Take Our Daughters to Work Day, often quotes child-rights advocate Marian Wright Edelman on this topic: \u201cYou can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see.\u201d \n \n Girls want to see role models: A recent study by the Girl Scouts found that 80 percent of girls want to interact with successful women, but 60 percent had not been offered the opportunity to see these women in action at the workplace. Boys, in contrast, see a variety of male leaders in all aspects of their lives. \n \n Companies can help girls by using the day to introduce their employees\u2019 daughters to women at the highest level of the company. And highlighting these leaders\u2019 accomplishments will give the women themselves more visibility. \n \n Girls also need to understand what leadership is like on a day-to-day basis.

    "document": "ST. PETERSBURG, Russia \u2014 After two days of intense lobbying, President Obama left a summit with world leaders Friday with some expressions of support for a strong U.S. response to Syria's alleged use of chemical weapons, but well short of an international coalition that might help persuade reluctant lawmakers. \n \n The president had hoped to use the meeting of the Group of 20 nations to build pressure on Congress as it considers whether to authorize missile strikes against Syrian President Bashar Assad's government. \n \n Before leaving for Washington, Obama said at a news conference that he will make his case in an address from the White House on Tuesday, an acknowledgment that his plans remain divisive both abroad and at home. \n \n \"This is not something that I think a lot of folks around the world, you know, find an appetizing set of choices,\" he said. \"But the question is, do these norms mean something? And if we're not acting, what does that say?\" \n \n The president had to settle for a carefully worded statement backed by representatives of 10 countries that said Assad should be held accountable for an alleged nerve gas attack on the Damascus suburbs two weeks ago, but did not explicitly support military action or promise participation. Among the leaders who did not endorse the statement was the summit's host, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is Assad's closest ally. \n \n Obama and Putin pulled up two chairs in a corner and talked for more than 20 minutes Friday, almost entirely about Syria. The leaders have exchanged harsh words, but Putin called the talk \"friendly\" and Obama said it was \"candid and constructive.\" But it did not break their impasse over how to respond to the suspected chemical weapons attack or how to end the 21/2-year-old Syrian civil war. \n \n \"We both remained unconvinced by each other's opinion,\" Putin said at a news conference. \"But there is a dialogue. We hear each other, we understand arguments, but we don't agree with them.\" \n \n Putin added that Russia will continue to supply weapons to Assad in his battle against the rebel opposition. Local news reports said three Russian ships and possibly a fourth were headed to the eastern Mediterranean, where the United States has four guided missile destroyers and an amphibious ship with 300 Marines. \n \n At a dinner that stretched into morning hours Friday, world leaders vigorously debated Obama's plan, with many saying the president should wait for the United Nations to complete a report on the Aug. 21 attack and sanction a response. Obama argued that the U.N. Security Council was paralyzed by disagreement. Russia and China, which have veto power, have blocked efforts at the Security Council to put pressure on Assad. \n \n Obama's plan for what he stresses will be \"limited and not open-ended\" strikes also remains unpopular in the United States. The statement and the heated discussion was a reminder of what Obama has called \"a heavy lift\" as he seeks to sell lawmakers and the American public on the need for a military response. \n \n Jon B. Alterman, the director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the problem for Obama isn't whether he has international support but American support. \"The people who matter right now are Americans,\" he said. \"If he can't convince them, it's catastrophic for his presidency.\" \n \n The Senate could take the first vote on the issue as soon as Wednesday, but the House should \"expect a robust debate\" and a vote in the \"next two weeks,\" Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) said. \n \n Although the Senate Foreign Relations Committee quickly approved a resolution this week, the already challenging politics have since become more complicated. Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.), who opposes the resolution, was consulting his colleagues on a proposal for a nonmilitary response. \n \n In the House, Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) said the Senate resolution, which aims to shift the momentum in the civil war toward the opposition, \"opens up a Pandora's box.\" \"I think the administration runs an incredible risk, if they try to placate those who want to expand American military intervention in Syria, because they risk losing support of the overwhelming majority of members,\" he said after meeting with Vice President Joe Biden. \n \n The Obama administration had resisted intervention in the war, but switched course after the alleged chemical weapons attack, which U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded killed more than 1,400 people. \n \n On Friday, Obama compared his bid for action to humanitarian intervention in Kosovo in 1999 and the U.S. failure to stop the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. He cast the international division as the result of war-weary leaders \"rationalizing not making tough choices.\" The United States alone, he said, shoulders the burden of enforcing international agreements on human rights and chemical warfare. \n \n \"There are times where we have to make hard choices if we're going to stand up for the things that we care about. And I believe that this is one of those times,\" Obama said. \n \n But Obama did not persuade a single ally to endorse a specific action. Immediately after he spoke, the White House released the joint statement from Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Spain and Turkey, as well as the United States. It found that evidence \"clearly points\" to Assad's government as responsible for the attack, called for a \"strong international response to this grave violation of the world's rules and conscience\" and asserted that \"the world cannot wait for endless failed processes.\" \n \n The statement did not specifically endorse military action, but concluded, \"We support efforts undertaken by the United States and other countries to reinforce the prohibition on the use of chemical weapons.\" \n \n A White House official, however, said there was no question what that implied. \"The president has been very clear about how he intends to do that with tailored military action,\" a senior administration official said. \n \n Still, the support was largely symbolic. The British Parliament has voted against participation in a military campaign. French President Francois Hollande, who offered the earliest support for Obama's plan, said Friday that his country will not engage in any action until after U.N. inspectors issue their report on the attack. \n \n Obama's last-minute decision to ask Congress to vote to approve the use of force gave world leaders little reason to risk supporting a mission that may not occur. The president has insisted that he does not need congressional authorization, but reiterated Friday that it would make a U.S. response \"more effective and stronger.\" \n \n Obama would not say whether he will launch missiles even if he loses the vote. Pressed on the issue, Obama was blunt. \"You're not getting a direct response,\" he said. \"I'm not going to engage in parlor games.\" \n \n In his absence from Washington on Friday, Biden, Secretary of State John F. Kerry and Chief of Staff Denis McDonough worked the phones; U.S. officials briefed members of Congress; and Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, gave a speech at a think tank, arguing, \"The use of limited military force can strengthen our diplomacy and energize the efforts by the U.N. and others.\" \n \n When Obama returns to Washington, he will oversee one of the most momentous lobbying efforts in his tenure. He promised that his administration would \"systematically\" reach out to every member of Congress. \n \n \"I do consider it part of my job to help make the case and to explain to the American people exactly why I think this is the right thing to do,\" he said, acknowledging that \"it's conceivable that, at the end of the day, I don't persuade a majority of the American people that it's the right thing to do.\" \n \n kathleen.hennessey@latimes.com \n \n sergei.loiko@latimes.com \n \n Hennessey reported from St. Petersburg and Loiko from Moscow. Times staff writers Michael A. Memoli, Christi Parsons and Paul Richter in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| WASHINGTON President Barack Obama told his war-weary country on Saturday that America needs to use limited military force in Syria to deter future chemical weapons attacks, but said he did not want to enter into another costly and protracted war. \n \n \"This would not be another Iraq or Afghanistan,\" Obama said in his weekly radio and internet address, previewing arguments he will make in a nationally televised address on Tuesday. \n \n \"Any action we take would be limited, both in time and scope - designed to deter the Syrian government from gassing its own people again and degrade its ability to do so,\" Obama said. \n \n A week ago, Obama said he felt limited strikes in Syria were needed, but added he wanted to ask Congress to authorize the use of military force. \n \n Neither Democratic nor Republican lawmakers have been enthused about the prospect, partly because Americans strongly oppose getting involved in another Middle Eastern conflict. \n \n A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday said 56 percent of Americans believed the United States should not intervene, while only 19 percent supported action. \n \n \"I know that the American people are weary after a decade of war, even as the war in Iraq has ended, and the war in Afghanistan is winding down. That's why we're not putting our troops in the middle of somebody else's war,\" Obama said in his recorded address. \n \n Obama and his top officials plan an intensive lobbying effort on Capitol Hill next week, scheduling meetings with undecided lawmakers. \n \n Obama said failing to respond to the August 21 attack that Washington blames on President Bashar al-Assad's government and that killed hundreds of children and more than 1,400 people in total, would threaten U.S. national security by increasing the chance of future chemical attacks from the Syrian government, terrorist groups, or other nations. \n \n \"We are the United States of America. We cannot turn a blind eye to images like the ones we've seen out of Syria,\" he said. \n \n (Reporting by Roberta Rampton; Editing by Peter Cooney)",

We hear each other, we understand arguments, but we don't agree with them.\" Obama said he and Putin had a \"candid and constructive\" 20-minute talk, reports the Los Angeles Times. \"This is not something that I think a lot of folks around the world, you know, find an appetizing set of choices,\" he said. \"But the question is, do these norms mean something?

A new poll by Media Research Center/McLaughlin & Associates, reported first by Axios, showed the attacks are working: 65% of self-described conservatives believe that social media companies purposely censor the right. \n \n A Trump operative tells me: \"It's risen to the level of being an emotional or gut issue with conservatives, like guns/immigration. It's an issue that's here to stay.\" \n \n Be smart: Conservatives charged bias and lies in mainstream news and then created right-wing alternatives. It should come as no surprise if they do the same two-step process to the modern form of distributing that news. \n \n Donald Trump Jr., who has 3 million Twitter followers and 1.3 million Instagram followers, told me there is \"exactly zero doubt in my mind\" that tech bias is real: \"I don't think [this issue] is going away, because I don't think it's changing.\" \n \n The president's oldest son, reflecting Trumpworld's growing appetite for action against Big Tech, said the companies need to self-regulate better: \"Many of these platforms get many benefits from the government.\" \n \n \ud83d\udea8 Don Jr. tells Axios that if a Trump supporter in the tech world created a conservative, Facebook-like social network, he would urge Trump supporters to switch to it. \n \n When I asked him if his father's 2020 campaign might build such a platform, Don Jr. said: \"I'd love to do it. But what I would prefer is, take one of the two Silicon Valley conservatives and let them start it. And then I'd help promote the platform and be all over that.\" \n \n him if his father's 2020 campaign might build such a platform, Don Jr. said: \"I'd love to do it. But what I would prefer is, And then I'd help promote the platform and be all over that.\" Scary thought: Imagine tribal news delivered via tribal pipes. And, as one mischievous Trump adviser told us, imagine the president moving his Twitter show to that network. \n \n House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), the likely Speaker if the GOP keeps the House, has driven the tech-bias issue among conservatives for months, and pushed a #StopTheBias hashtag that the president tweeted yesterday. \n \n McCarthy told me: \"The companies cannot sit back and say nothing is happening. Algorithms are written by people. Everybody has some bias in them. Anyone claims they don't have bias, they're not human.\" \n \n Why it matters: Top Republicans tell us this will be a major line of escalated attack at a congressional hearing next week with Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey.",

(AP Photo/Jacques Brinon) (Associated Press) \n \n They go to Karl Lagerfeld's luxury Chanel supermarket, of course. \n \n Tuesday saw the fashion showman put on a \"Chanel Shopping Center\" fall-winter show that featured an audacious Walmart-sized reconstruction and saw the celebrity pair applaud vigorously from the front row. They clearly didn't seem to mind sitting near the canned goods food section. \n \n However, events took a nose dive after the show when the rowdy fashion crowd looted the set. \n \n Here are the highlights of this and Tuesday's other incredible ready-to-wear shows in Paris. \n \n CHANEL'S SUPERMARKET IS SO LUXURY IT GETS LOOTED \n \n The attention to detail was astounding. \n \n An entire supermarket had been reconstructed across several hundred square meters of Paris' Grand Palais. \n \n Guests stared in disbelief at shelves bursting with consumable products especially made for this show: bottles of \"Tweed cola,\" wine branded \"Maison Gabrielle,\" and even grilled bread stamped \"CC.\" \n \n This was clearly a fall-winter show like no other. \n \n Chanel trolleys at the side led on to a tall pile of coconuts next to writing \"1 for the price of 2,\" a fresh fruits and veg section, and large signs advertising Chanel's latest special offers. Instead of discounts they read \"50 percent markup.\" \n \n \"Luxury should be worn like you're going to the supermarket. It's the pop art of the 21st century,\" said the couturier in high spirits. \n \n At the very least, it's proof that Lagerfeld is fashion's greatest showman. \n \n Though the set was a universal hit, perhaps Monsieur Lagerfeld later had one regret: telling revelers they could help themselves to the produce. \n \n It triggered a stealing-frenzy, with security guards having to swoop in as revelers stripped the shelves. At the exit, fashionistas' bags were actually searched to remove stolen goods. One fashion editor succeeded in making off with a Chanel doormat. \n \n KEIRA KNIGHTLEY, RIHANNA AND CHANEL COOKING OIL \n \n \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" star Keira Knightley \u2014 in a monochrome Chanel dress with tiny waist \u2014 rocked the front row alongside her husband, Klaxons singer James Righton whom she married last year. \n \n They entered a cordoned-off area after the show alongside superstar Rihanna near some Chanel cooking oil. \n \n It triggered a media frenzy with a worried Knightley saying, \"I think there's a fight breaking out.\" \n \n Her husband, who watched from the sidelines, seemed puzzled by the luxury supermarket concept. \"It's my first Chanel show. It was fairly mad. Is this normal?\" \n \n Yes, at least in Lagerfeld's world it is. \n \n THE CHANEL CLOTHES CHANNEL YOUTH AND COLOR \n \n Just like a supermarket, Lagerfeld produced a collection that was so varied there was choice for everyone. \n \n With attention given to large rounded shoulders, exaggerated upper torsos, cinched or exposed midriffs and lashings of tweed, Lagerfeld mixed and matched. \n \n Stylish brown tweed was turned into a jumpsuit \u2014 with voluminous pockets on the bust and great 80s turn ups. \n \n A section that seemed to channel the designs of artist Vassily Kandinsky provided bursts of color on driving coats and a pair of bold blue and green leggings. It looked very young, but Lagerfeld quipped after the show: \"Never young enough for today's standard. The older the (women) are, the younger they want to look!\" \n \n For the fun factor, models carried large leather and silver-bound Chanel shopping baskets as they theatrically browsed the catwalk shelving. \n \n If the show seemed to lack the focus of Lagerfeld's best shows, some fantastic single garments made up for it. One black three-quarter length coat had a lovely fluidity with delicate diagonal ribs. \n \n IRIS VAN HERPEN'S SHOCK TACTICS \n \n The human body was in focus at Dutch designer Iris Van Herpen's sublime debut catwalk show on the ready-to-wear calendar. \n \n Van Herpen likes to shock. \n \n In this show the shock-factor saw three models writhing in suspended square plastic bags that had the oxygen sucked out. \n \n It disturbed several guests as it looked as if the models were in discomfort or couldn't breathe. \n \n In the clothes, embroidered beads on mini sheaths resembled shining human cells on models in jutting boots without heels. While some beautifully executed techno-fabric, silver, cocktail dresses glistened like organic fluid. \n \n Several looks also seemed to turn the body inside out: black and white chubby fur tops had the top slashed off to reveal flaps of fabric like exposed flesh. \n \n The collection perfectly towed the line between surreal artistry and wearability, but next time Van Herpen shouldn't try to frighten guests. \n \n ALEXANDER MCQUEEN'S LITTLE BO PEEP HAS LOST HER WEREWOLF \n \n Sarah Burton produced a cryptic but accomplished show for Alexander McQueen set on an emotive green heath. \n \n A-line skirts in broderie anglaise, large white rounded collars, thigh-high lace up boots and tulle embellishments pointed to an 18th century vibe. \n \n Then, the patches of long black and white fur and animal eyebrows at times looked like Burton was going for a werewolf vibe. \n \n Was she chanelling the beginnings of British gothic horror writing that started in the late 18th century? \n \n VALENTINO'S ANSWER TO THE SWINGING SIXTIES \n \n Valentino 's Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli gave their diaphanous, and slightly puritanical designs, an injection of 1960s and Pop Art. \n \n Though the design duo they didn't pay attention to the menswear vibe sweeping fall-winter shows so far \u2014 and people don't expect uber-feminine Valentino to, either \u2014 this show definitely felt more \"trendy\" than in previous seasons. \n \n The best look was a shimmering silk purple, silver and pewter baby-doll dress with black color. And some of the harlequin looks were eye-catching, though sometimes a little busy. \n \n It was the couture-infused gowns they did best \u2014 after all, couture is almost synonymous with the house. \n \n Fastidiously embroidered butterflies gave a beautiful lift to a sexy sheer tulle cocktail gown and continued with a bird motif on another in deep blue. \n \n ___ \n \n Thomas Adamson can be followed at Twitter.com/ThomasAdamsonAP ||||| 1 of 5. German designer Karl Lagerfeld (R) and model Cara Delevingne appear at the end of his Fall/Winter 2014-2015 women's ready-to-wear collection show for French fashion house Chanel at the Grand Palais transformed into a 'Chanel Shopping Center' during Paris Fashion Week March 4, 2014. \n \n PARIS (Reuters) - Most designers try to make consumers dream at their fashion shows, but Karl Lagerfeld sought to bring them back into real life by presenting his latest collection in a spoof Chanel supermarket. \n \n Paris' prestigious Grand Palais, where the French brand traditionally hosts its glamorous shows, was filled with endless rows of Chanel-branded pasta, cheeses, sauces, detergents and other products of daily life created solely for the occasion. \n \n \"For me the supermarket is the pop art of today,\" Lagerfeld said on Tuesday after the show, admitting he rarely went to supermarkets himself. \n \n Pushing brightly colored trolleys and pretending to exchange gossip, models picked up products with tongue-in-cheek labels such as Coco beer bottles, Chateau Gabrielle white wine and Chanel cr\u00e9meuh - or creamoo - milk. \n \n Others carried metallic baskets adorned with Chanel's iconic handbag chains. \n \n The designer's new autumn/winter collection was full of oversized tweed jackets worn over shiny pencil-thin pants complete with flashy sneakers, also spotted at January's haute couture show. \n \n Some models wore comfortable-looking orange woolen jogging suits and fluorescent pink shredded leggings. \n \n Speakers spat out loud pop music, interrupted by public announcements such as \"the young Marine is waiting for her parents at the cashiers\" or \"Mrs Martin is requested at the fresh foods department\". \n \n Lagerfeld said Chanel had created more than 500 different labels and put more than 100,000 items on display, some of which would be later given to charity. \n \n No cost or detail was spared to create the atmosphere of a typical French supermarket such as Carrefour. \n \n Hanging over the white aisles, some giant yellow signs offered 20 percent discounts while others said: \"the DIY department is open on Sundays,\" pointing to recent controversy in France over allowing DIY shops to trade on Sundays. \n \n Once the show was over, many members of the audience furiously seized Chanel food products from the shelves. \n \n \"The supermarket concept was brilliant as it put fashion into real life,\" French actress and singer Vanessa Paradis, previously the face of Chanel's Coco perfume and lipstick, told Reuters after the show. \n \n Lagerfeld, who turned 80 last year and has spent three decades at Chanel's helm, is credited with having regularly infused fresh life into the brand to keep it modern and in tune with its times while remaining faithful to its heritage. \n \n \"It is not because you buy Chanel clothes that you should not be allowed into the supermarket,\" Lagerfeld said after exchanging hugs and kisses with his A-lists guests such as singer Rihanna and actress Keira Knightley. \n \n (Reporting by Astrid Wendlandt; Editing by Catherine Evans)",

What with their big eyes and their smooth skin and their happy smiles and their unrivaled feces-production capabilities. Babies! Am I right? \n \n The documentary Babies asks the tough questions about human infants, questions such as: Aren't they cute? Seriously, would you look at them? How cute are they? Couldn't you just eat them up? The answers may surprise you. \n \n Four infants from different corners of the globe are our entry points into the world of babydom. Ponijao, a boy, lives happily amid dirt and flies in the desert of Namibia. Bayarjargal, also a boy, is Mongolian. The fairer sex is represented by Mari, in Tokyo, and Hattie, in San Francisco. The filmmaker, Thomas Balmes, starts with their births (quite graphically, in one case), then observes them for about two years. \n \n And, uh, that's it. Balmes makes no attempt to shape the footage into \"stories\" or \"plots.\" He employs no narrator. When the babies' parents and caretakers speak in their native tongues, no subtitles are provided. Balmes' intent is not to interfere or interpret or direct, but merely to observe. That's admirable when you're documenting something dynamic or controversial. But without some nudging, babies don't DO anything. They coo, cry, laugh, gurgle, crawl, and toddle. And while that's pleasant to watch now and then, it gets tiresome when it lasts 80 minutes. The babies stay young, but the movie gets old fast. \n \n Some of the cultural differences are interesting, though. There's an amusing contrast between the upscale urban lives of Mari and Hattie and the rural, primitive way Ponijao and Bayar are brought up. While Hattie's mother is at the pediatrician's office asking about SIDS and the right position for Hattie to sleep in, Ponijao's mother is squatting in the dirt, being pooped on by her naked baby, then wiping it off with a dry corncob. Mari is coddled by her mother at a play group, where jaunty baby songs are sung. Bayar is left unattended in a field of cattle. \n \n Sure, the babies' interactions with their siblings and pets are occasionally amusing. If you trained a camcorder on your own baby for several hours, you'd capture events very much like these, though perhaps with less corncobbing. In fact, there is almost literally no difference between watching Babies and just watching a baby. Alfred Hithcock said drama is \"life with the dull bits cut out.\" Babies is life with the dull bits intact. \n \n Grade: C \n \n * * * * \n \n Eric D. Snider (website) refuses to buy anything less than a two-ply corncob. ||||| Enlarge By Focus Features Hello, Hattie: She's one of the four babies profiled in Babies, and she lives a relatively privileged life in San Francisco with her family. ABOUT THE MOVIE ABOUT THE MOVIE Babies * * * 1/2 (out of four) Director: Thomas Balmes \n \n Distributor: Focus Features \n \n Rating: PG for cultural and maternal nudity throughout \n \n Running time: 1 hour, 19 minutes \n \n Opens Friday nationwide There's nothing Hollywood or Gerber about Babies. But it will be hard to watch this extraordinary film and its adorable stars without a goofy smile. This observant documentary offers an up-close-and-personal glimpse of four babies from vastly different cultures in their first year of life. It's no home video. The photography is stunning, and Bruno Coulais' music adds just the right soundtrack to this intriguing visual diary. TRAILER: Check out 'Babies' DOCUMENTARY: 'Babies' makes mothers' day 9 LIL' FACTS: How 'Babies' was conceived Director Thomas Balm\u00e8s has a light touch capturing the captivating moments of early life. It's not a traditional documentary; there's no narration, subtitles or scientific information imparted. There's far more gurgling and cooing than dialogue. The developmental similarities are there, but it's the differences in behavior and circumstances that jump out. We meet the easygoing Ponijao, her mother and other members of her Himba tribe outside her family's dirt hut in Namibia. Curious Bayarjargal lives with his parents and siblings and a herd of cattle on their farm in remote Mongolia. Mari has a toy-filled existence in a small apartment with her parents in Tokyo. Hattie lives a pampered American life in San Francisco with parents. She is taken to baby yoga, and a book titled No Hitting sits prominently on a bookshelf. Ponijao and other tribal children share easily, Bayarjargal and his brother squabble, but their parents generally let them work it out. Mari doesn't have as much chance to interact with other babies, but gets frustrated by the bevy of educational toys set out to amuse her. Some of the most riveting moments in this cinematic scrapbook are those most removed from American experience. Bayarjargal lies swaddled on his back, watching raptly as a colorful rooster parades around his bed, perilously close to stepping on the infant. When old enough to crawl, he fearlessly makes his way into a herd of cattle. No one is around to swoop him up. But the cows step around him and the boy obliviously ambles off. Ponijao exchanges a kiss with a roaming dog. Ponijao and her family seem the most content, though their circumstances are easily the most meager. This could be because of Balm\u00e8s' Rousseau-like belief in the nobility of those living closest to the natural state. There does seem to be this subtle point of view, based on his scenes chosen from the 400 hours of footage shot. The procession of youthful behavior is almost hypnotic, but Babies is delivered with refreshing immediacy and joyful humor.

Read more ||||| Movie review: 'Babies,' a joyous and buoyant new documentary \n \n Director Thomas Balm\u00e8s documents the first year in the lives of four infants from different parts of the world. \n \n Our stars here are Ponijao from Namibia, Mari in Tokyo, Hattie from San Francisco and Bayarjargal, the only boy in the bunch, from Mongolia. We meet them at birth or soon after with Hattie's short hospital stay, her body wired to countless high-tech machines, a reminder of how fragile life can be. Sturdy too, as Bayar is strapped up papoose style just hours after birth for the motorcycle trip back to the pasture where the family's cattle graze. \n \n It is both a strength and a weakness that beyond the normal spills that come with sitting, crawling, walking and other early milestones, there is not one truly difficult moment that darkens the screen. If anything, the sweet-smelling \"Babies\" is the complete opposite of the conflict-riddled reality media world that dominates these days. The \"awww\" without the \"shock\" definitely makes \"Babies\" a very huggable movie experience, just not a primer on parenthood. \n \n Like the trailer that has been charming audiences for months, this is babyhood airbrushed to a high gloss. Squalls are few, colic doesn't exist, neither does disease, diaper rash or diapers at all for that matter as director Thomas Balm\u00e8s traces the first year in the lives of four infants from four corners of the world. \n \n In the joyous and buoyant new documentary \"Babies,\" the filmmakers keep the baby \u2014 and the bathwater \u2014 and everything else about infants that makes them so appealing that the rest of us keep making more of them. \n \n Circumstances range from primitive \u2014 Poni's family is part of an extended rural Himba tribe \u2014 to the urban affluence of Tokyo and San Francisco. It's a testament to the fundamental adorableness of infants that all were \"cast\" before they were born and are universally photogenic. Even so, stars will always emerge and Ponijao and Bayar, whose lives are virtually untouched by modern conveniences or modern parenting, prove to be major scene-stealers who could have carried the film on their own. \n \n The director has said one of the main characteristics he wanted in the families he would follow was that the child would be loved. That is perhaps the most significant truth of the film: Children surrounded by love are likely to thrive and are delightful to observe. \n \n Even though these are beautiful babies, there is an art to creating images that are both provocative and powerful, and in that the director is skilled. A good thing since there is no narrative, no script, no statistics \u2014 just coos, gurgles, laughter and the occasional scream. Thankfully actions do speak louder than words, with Mari's tantrum over her difficulties mastering the classic stacking toy of doughnut-shaped wooden circles that must be slipped onto a dowel all that needs to be said about frustration. The lack of language, for both the subjects and the film itself, also keeps any larger messages about the real task of having and raising babies at bay. \n \n That is not to say there is no story. Balm\u00e8s, editors Craig McKay (\"Reds,\" \"The Silence of the Lambs\" ) and Reynald Bertrand (\"La Cr\u00e8me\"), and music by Bruno Coulais ( \"Coraline\" ) create a nearly perfectly paced window into an infant's evolution. The filmmakers stay with each baby long enough to capture their individuality and switch at the right moments to underscore how certain experiences are alike no matter who or where you are \u2014 the day Bayar discovers his feet for instance. \n \n For the French documentarian, \"Babies\" represents a significant shift in style and topic. Balm\u00e8s began his career with the 1996 \"Bosnia Hotel,\" following U.N. peacekeepers from Kenya as they monitored the volatile Eastern European country. In the years since, he has examined a Nokia factory in China, a personal injury law firm in Connecticut and the Mad Cow crisis in India, where cows may be mad but they're also sacred. \n \n Although \"Babies\" is light and filled with laughter, the making of the film was labor-intensive, shooting for 400 days over two years, often 12-hour days yielding only one usable shot. Balm\u00e8s relied on a digital camera and often virtually no crew to keep the babies' environment as natural as possible. The result is irresistible and possibly infectious. Childhood and child-rearing through Balm\u00e8s lens is overflowing with love and free of disappointments and pain \u2014 oh, if it were only so. ||||| For some reason, Thomas Balm\u00e8s\u2019s documentary \u201cBabies\u2019\u2019 is being released in time for Mother\u2019s Day weekend. Superficially, it seems like the right idea. Balm\u00e8s found four perfectly adorable babies in different regions of the world \u2014 San Francisco, Mongolia, Tokyo, and the Namibian flatlands \u2014 and filmed them for about their first 12 months. But for some mothers, this will feel like work. See these children fight, cry, freak out, stare off into space, be cleaned, urinate, drink breast milk, and get a haircut. Been there, done that: Where are my flowers? \n \n Still, as an advertisement for the wonders of figuring out how to be alive, the movie is an engaging proposition. When the film isn\u2019t oscillating among its subjects, it\u2019s partially juxtaposing images. In California, Hattie\u2019s dad takes a shower with her. In Namibia, Ponijao\u2019s mother licks her clean. Balm\u00e8s\u2019s approach is averse to cuteness for its own sake and watchful enough to leave you time to wonder about how you\u2019d feel spending the first year of your life with a camera in your face. \n \n Bayar in Mongolia seems like a deep thinker, lying on his back, indifferent to the rooster standing by his head. To her father\u2019s consternation, Mari, the Tokyo baby, is a deep rattler. And Ponijao seems like a deep feeler \u2014 emotionally and tactilely. She wails when her older brother hits her and looks intense as she pushes her hands and face into barren red earth. This region of Namibia \u2014 Kunene \u2014 is the most consistently fascinating material in the film. Aside from National Geographic visits, it\u2019s an infrequently documented part of the world. And the Himba people, who operate in tribes, wear few clothes, and spend a lot of time doing their hair, are innately cinematic. They live very low to the ground, among wildlife and livestock, and seem to get a kick out of each other. Blips of modernity \u2014 a plastic water bottle or an oil drum \u2014 appear around the homestead. Ponijao has a biological mother, but several tribeswomen are raising her and they find a source of amusement in her development. \n \n I don\u2019t think the movie is looking for answers; it isn\u2019t asking any questions. But by its very nature, this is both an experiment in ontology (do babies know they\u2019re babies?) and existentialism (are they thinking about who to be?). Balm\u00e8s tries to emphasize an aspect of communal life in most of the film\u2019s four sections. In San Francisco, he appears to fall for clich\u00e9s. At some point, Hattie, a blonde with blue eyes, finds herself in a hippie drum circle (\u201cHey yanna, ho yanna, hey yanna ho\u2019\u2019 \u2014 that sort of thing). Having heard enough, she heads to the nearest exit, implying, at the very least, a future in criticism. \n \n Wesley Morris can be reached at wmorris@globe.com. \n \n \u00a9 Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper Company.",

    "document": "VATICAN CITY \u2014 Ban Ki-moon arrived at the Vatican with his own college of cardinals. Mr. Ban, the United Nations secretary general, had brought the leaders of all his major agencies to see Pope Francis, a show of organizational muscle and respect for a meeting between two global institutions that had sometimes shared a bumpy past but now had a mutual interest. \n \n The agenda was poverty, and Francis inveighed against the \u201ceconomy of exclusion\u201d as he addressed Mr. Ban\u2019s delegation at the Apostolic Palace. But in an informal meeting with Mr. Ban and his advisers, Francis shifted the discussion to the environment and how environmental degradation weighed heaviest on the poor. \n \n \u201cThis is the pope of the poor,\u201d said Robert Orr, who attended the May 2014 meeting as Mr. Ban\u2019s special adviser on climate change and described the informal conversation with Francis. \u201cThe fact that he is making the link to the planet is really significant.\u201d \n \n On Thursday, Francis will release his first major teaching letter, known as an encyclical, on the theme of the environment and the poor. Given the pope\u2019s widespread popularity, and his penchant for speaking out on major global issues, the encyclical is being treated as a milestone that could place the Roman Catholic Church at the forefront of a new coalition of religion and science. ||||| CLOSE Shannon Green and Gregg Zoroya discuss the encyclical from Pope Francis to be issued by the Vatican on Thursday, June 18, and the excitement it engenders among climate scientists. USA TODAY \n \n Pope Francis encyclical on the environment is due to be released Thursday (Photo: Alessandra Tarantino, AP) \n \n Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this article misstated Pope Francis' chemistry education. He studied chemistry and worked as a chemist prior to attending the seminary. \n \n Scientists weary after years of often vicious opposition by doubters of their climate-change findings see this year as crucial to the planet's future because of a religious document expected from Pope Francis on Thursday. \n \n The rare encyclical, or teaching letter, expected to promote climate action as a moral imperative could do more to slow global warming than international negotiations this year to limit greenhouse gas emissions, scientists say. \n \n \"The encyclical is going to go out to over 1 billion Catholics \u2014 that's a way of getting a message across to a segment of society that the scientific community could never do,\" said an excited Jeff Kiehl with the National Center for Atmospheric Research. \"I mean it's just unbelievable.\" \n \n \"I'm not a religious person at all,\" said Gavin Schmidt, a NASA climatologist. But he sees faith-based efforts to shift thinking on climate action as very promising. \n \n \"The pope's encyclical is probably going to have a bigger impact than the Paris negotiations,\" he said. \n \n The 21st United Nations conference on climate change, which is set for December in Paris with more than 190 countries, hopes to reach agreement on emissions that would keep further warming of the planet less than 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, beyond global temperature at the time of the Industrial Revolution. \n \n Catholic leaders expressed hope last week that the encyclical will transcend partisan fighting over the causes of climate change, arguments that have stymied efforts in the U.S. Congress and elsewhere to reduce greenhouse emissions. \n \n \"This encyclical is aimed at everyone,\" Pope Francis said Sunday. \"Let us pray that everyone can receive its message and grow in responsibility toward the common home that God has entrusted to us.\" \n \n He said Friday that to show unity of purpose, the document will be unveiled by three people: a Catholic cardinal, a Christian Orthodox church leader and a climate scientist the Vatican identified as an atheist. \n \n The pope, who studied chemistry and worked as a chemist before entering the seminary, has a history of environmental concern. He said in January that science is largely settled on the causes of climate change and that greater stewardship of God's creation is necessary. \n \n \"Mostly, in great part, it is man who has slapped nature in the face,\" he said. \n \n There has already been push back from conservative Catholic religious writers and figures such as Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, who is Catholic, accusing the pope of being alarmist. \n \n \"The church has gotten it wrong a few times on science, and I think that we probably are better off leaving science to the scientists,\" Santorum recently told a radio-talk show host. \"When we get involved with political and controversial scientific theories, then I think the church is probably not as forceful and credible.\" \n \n Scientists, however, applaud the pope for urging moral choices in a discussion dominated by the recitation \u2014 or among deniers, the misrepresentation \u2014 of facts. \n \n \"Many people have this rosy view that there's this knowledge deficit, and that if we just provided more information or if we explain the science better or if we package it better, maybe with colored graphics, or write another scientific paper, that will be the one to convince (doubters),\" said climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University. \n \n \"But the reality is it's not a scientific issue (any longer). It is an ideological issue. We have to appeal to people based on values. Not just on data and facts. And for me as a scientist to say that is very unusual,\" Hayhoe said. \"So from that perspective the pope is a very effective messenger.\" \n \n Scientists say that some predicted changes such as a warming Arctic, rising sea levels, more intense heat waves, extreme snow and rain storms and animal or plant extinctions are happening faster than anticipated. Frustration over a lack of response by the federal government has been growing. \n \n A website created by Australian science communicator Joe Duggan called \"Is this how you feel?\" contains dozens of letters from climate scientists angry or stunned by a lack of forceful action by policymakers. \n \n \"I feel like nobody's listening,\" Australian research fellow Helen McGregor wrote last fall. \n \n \"There is so much noise around the issue that I often feel compelled to be outraged by our own inability as a species to respond,\" scientist Carlo Buontempo wrote, \"But the truth is that more often than not I just feel tired.\" \n \n The vast majority say they remain optimistic. Last year, a consortium of North American universities created a speakers network for climate change discussion and more than 370 scientists have since signed up to give talks at libraries, chambers of commerce, schools, colleges and community clubs. \n \n But change still seems too slow, many say. \n \n \"As a scientist, I can say that it is possible for us to prevent truly catastrophic, potentially irreversible climate change. But I cannot say as a scientist whether or not we will find the will to do what's necessary,\" said Michael Mann, a climate scientist at Penn State University who published a book on the role of science deniers in subverting global warming discussions. \n \n Mann said only strong public outcry can force policy changes, and this is where the encyclical is crucial. \n \n \"There are a lot of people out there who thus far have been either skeptical or indifferent,\" Mann said. \"I think this (encyclical) will make a difference for them.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1Sfph3i ||||| The most anticipated papal letter for decades will be published in five languages on Thursday. It will call for an end to the \u2018tyrannical\u2019 exploitation of nature by mankind. Could it lead to a step-change in the battle against global warming? \n \n Pope Francis will call for an ethical and economic revolution to prevent catastrophic climate change and growing inequality in a letter to the world\u2019s 1.2 billion Catholics on Thursday. \n \n In an unprecedented encyclical on the subject of the environment, the pontiff is expected to argue that humanity\u2019s exploitation of the planet\u2019s resources has crossed the Earth\u2019s natural boundaries, and that the world faces ruin without a revolution in hearts and minds. The much-anticipated message, which will be sent to the world\u2019s 5,000 Catholic bishops, will be published online in five languages on Thursday and is expected to be the most radical statement yet from the outspoken pontiff. \n \n However, it is certain to anger sections of Republican opinion in America by endorsing the warnings of climate scientists and admonishing rich elites, say cardinals and scientists who have advised the Vatican. \n \n The Ghanaian cardinal, Peter Turkson, president of the Vatican\u2019s Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and a close ally of the pope, will launch the encyclical. He has said it will address the root causes of poverty and the threats facing nature, or \u201ccreation\u201d. \n \n In a recent speech widely regarded as a curtain-raiser to the encyclical, Turkson said: \u201cMuch of the world remains in poverty, despite abundant resources, while a privileged global elite controls the bulk of the world\u2019s wealth and consumes the bulk of its resources.\u201d \n \n The Argentinian pontiff is expected to repeat calls for a change in attitudes to poverty and nature. \u201cAn economic system centred on the god of money needs to plunder nature to sustain the frenetic rhythm of consumption that is inherent to it,\u201d he told a meeting of social movements last year. \u201cI think a question that we are not asking ourselves is: isn\u2019t humanity committing suicide with this indiscriminate and tyrannical use of nature? Safeguard creation because, if we destroy it, it will destroy us. Never forget this.\u201d \n \n The encyclical will go much further than strictly environmental concerns, say Vatican insiders. \u201cPope Francis has repeatedly stated that the environment is not only an economic or political issue, but is an anthropological and ethical matter,\u201d said another of the pope\u2019s advisers, Archbishop Pedro Barreto Jimeno of Peru. \n \n \u201cIt will address the issue of inequality in the distribution of resources and topics such as the wasting of food and the irresponsible exploitation of nature and the consequences for people\u2019s life and health,\u201d Barreto Jimeno told the Catholic News Service. \n \n He was echoed by Cardinal Oscar Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga of Honduras, who coordinates the Vatican\u2019s inner council of cardinals and is thought to reflect the pope\u2019s political thinking . \u201cThe ideology surrounding environmental issues is too tied to a capitalism that doesn\u2019t want to stop ruining the environment because they don\u2019t want to give up their profits,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga said. \n \n The rare encyclical, called \u201cLaudato Sii\u201d, or \u201cPraised Be\u201d, has been timed to have maximum public impact ahead of the pope\u2019s meeting with Barack Obama and his address to the US Congress and the UN general assembly in September. \n \n It is also intended to improve the prospect of a strong new UN global agreement to cut climate emissions. By adding a moral dimension to the well-rehearsed scientific arguments, Francis hopes to raise the ambition of countries above their own self-interest to secure a strong deal in a crucial climate summit in Paris in November. \n \n \u201cPope Francis is personally committed to this [climate] issue like no other pope before him. The encyclical will have a major impact. It will speak to the moral imperative of addressing climate change in a timely fashion in order to protect the most vulnerable,\u201d said Christiana Figueres, the UN\u2019s climate chief, in Bonn this week for negotiations. \n \n Francis, the first Latin American pope, is increasingly seen as the voice of the global south and a catalyst for change in global bodies. In September, he will seek to add impetus and moral authority to UN negotiations in New York to adopt new development goals and lay out a 15-year global plan to tackle hunger, extreme poverty and health. He will address the UN general assembly on 23 September as countries finalise their commitments. \n \n However, Francis\u2019s radicalism is attracting resistance from Vatican conservatives and in rightwing church circles, particularly in the US \u2013 where Catholic climate sceptics also include John Boehner, Republican leader of the House of Representatives, and Rick Santorum, a Republican presidential candidate. \n \n Earlier this year Stephen Moore, a Catholic economist, called the pope a \u201ccomplete disaster\u201d, saying he was part of \u201ca radical green movement that is at its core anti-Christian, anti-people and anti-progress\u201d. \n \n Moore was backed this month by scientists and engineers from the powerful evangelical Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation, who have written an open letter to Francis. \u201cToday many prominent voices call humanity a scourge on our planet, saying that man is the problem, not the solution. Such attitudes too often contaminate their assessment of man\u2019s effects on nature,\u201d it says. \n \n But the encyclical will be well received in developing countries, where most Catholics live. \u201cFrancis has always put the poor at the centre of everything he has said. The developing countries will hear their voice in the encyclical,\u201d said Neil Thorns, director of advocacy at the Catholic development agency, Cafod. \u201cI expect it to challenge the way we think. The message that we cannot just treat the Earth as a tool for exploitation will be a message that many will not want to hear.\u201d \n \n The pope is \u201caiming at a change of heart. What will save us is not technology or science. What will save us is the ethical transformation of our society,\u201d said Carmelite Father Eduardo Agosta Scarel, a climate scientist who teaches at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina in Buenos Aires. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Video: Suzanne Goldenberg visits the Heartland Institute\u2019s conference in Washington, an annual gathering of climate sceptics, to hear what delegates \u2013 including US senator James Inhofe and blogger Marc Morano \u2013 think about the Pope\u2019s upcoming encyclical on the environment and climate change . \n \n Earlier popes, including Benedict XVI and John Paul II, addressed environmental issues and \u201ccreation\u201d, but neither mentioned climate change or devoted an entire encyclical to the links between poverty, economics and ecological destruction. Francis\u2019s only previous encyclical concerned the nature of religious faith. \n \n The pontiff, who is playing an increasing role on the world stage, will visit Cuba ahead of travelling to the US. He was cited by Obama as having helped to thaw relations between the two countries, and last week met the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to discuss the crisis in Ukraine and the threat to minority Christians in the Middle East. \n \n The pope chose Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals, as his namesake at the start of his papacy in 2011, saying the saint\u2019s values reflected his own. \n \n \n \n ||||| VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis is looking for a global audience for his upcoming encyclical on the environment, saying Sunday it's meant for everyone, not just Catholics. \n \n Pope Francis is cheered by the crowd as he arrives for an audience with Italian AGESCI boy scouts association's members in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican, Saturday, June 13, 2015.

Francis will be accompanied by an atheist climate scientist and a Greek Orthodox theologian, as well as a Vatican cardinal, when he releases his long-anticipated letter on the environment on Thursday, the AP reports. The encyclical, a rare papal \"teaching letter,\" is expected to focus on climate change, humanity's role in causing it, and its devastating and disproportionate effects on the world's poor, reports the New York Times, which notes that Francis has long been outspoken on environmental issues and told reporters earlier this year that \"man has slapped nature in the face.\" In a recent speech seen as a preview to the encyclical, Francis made it clear that he believes climate change and the suffering of the poor is the result of capitalism and overconsumption, the Guardian reports. \"Much of the world remains in poverty, despite abundant resources, while a privileged global elite controls the bulk of the world's wealth and consumes the bulk of its resources,\" he said. Climate scientists say since the issue has become an ideological and partisan one as much as it is a scientific one, the papal letter could do more than international negotiations this year to reduce emissions, USA Today reports.

    "document": "UPDATE: The Globe And Mail is now reporting that Madonna's camp has issued and distributed a press release denying she told volunteers to turn away from her. \n \n The following is an excerpt from the press release: \n \n \"Neither Madonna nor her security ever gave instructions for the volunteers to turn away from Madonna. In fact she was so impressed with the volunteers that she publicly thanked them from the stage for their hard work before the premiere of her film last night which earned a standing ovation. She had a wonderful time at the festival and was especially delighted that she got to spend so much time with her fans in front of the theatre which is a famous tradition at the Festival ... We are still trying to figure out who and why anyone would ask the volunteers to turn away from Madonna. She has never and would never ask anyone to do that ever\" \n \n _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n \n \n \n At the Toronto International Film Festival, each movie showing opens with a pre-roll of messages meant to inform the press, industry folk and public about different aspects of the major event. Amongst the most prominent of these ads is a series of sketches featuring famous directors in messy scenarios, a sort of parallel universe that would explode without the help of the festival's ubiquitous and dutiful orange-shirted volunteers. The ad ends with a thank you to the unpaid staff for all their hard work, and the audience, on cue, applauses resoundingly. \n \n Maybe she hasn't seen a movie at the festival yet, or maybe they gave her a bouquet of hydrangeas; either way, Madonna, according to a report in Toronto's Globe and Mail, did not quite show the same appreciation for the volunteers' tireless hustle. \n \n The \"W.E.\" director premiered her film at the festival Monday night, and earlier in the day, sat down for a press conference with a gaggle of international reporters. Backstage, before the event, word is that she refused to allow the volunteers to even look at her in the eye. Instead, as a volunteer told the paper, they had to turn their backs to her as she made her way to speak with the assembled masses. \n \n Clearly, Madonna doesn't deal well with the little people press events; it was in Venice that she made her infamous hydrangea diss. Which, by the way, she refuses to let go away. \n \n PHOTOS: \n \n \n \n \n \n BACK TO ARTICLE Madonna 1 / 20 ADVERTISEMENT CURRENT TOP 5 SLIDES RATE THIS PHOTO 1 \n \n 2 \n \n 3 \n \n 4 \n \n 5 \n \n 6 \n \n 7 \n \n 8 \n \n 9 \n \n 10 \n \n VOTE USERS WHO VOTED ON THIS SLIDE SLIDESHOW THUMBNAILS \n \n WATCH: \n \n ||||| Director Madonna poses before the news conference for the film ''W.E.'' at the 36th Toronto International Film Festival September 12, 2011. \n \n TORONTO | \n \n TORONTO (Reuters) - Madonna on Monday said she said she doesn't mind any criticism of her filmmaking abilities, so long as it is directed at her movie and not at herself. \n \n The pop star told reporters at the Toronto International Film Festival, where she is promoting her second film \"W.E.\", she had to earn her reputation as a musician and she expected to do the same as a film director. \n \n \"I had the same kind of pressure when I began my music career,\" Madonna told reporters. \"I was nervous, and I didn't know what to expect, and people didn't know what to expect.\" \n \n The film, which premiered at the Venice film festival and is screening at Toronto, has been characterized by critics as visually stunning, but lacking in focus and burdened by weak performances. \n \n \"I can tell when people are reviewing my film and when they're reviewing me personally,\" Madonna said when asked whether she cared about what critics thought. \"So when they stick to the film, then I do care.\" \n \n \"W.E.\" stars Abbie Cornish as a young New Yorker in the 1990s who becomes infatuated with the 1930s marriage of King Edward VIII and American divorcee Wallis Simpson, played by Andrea Riseborough. It follows Madonna's first feature, 2008's \"Filth and Wisdom,\" which performed poorly at the box office. \n \n Britain's The Guardian newspaper was the harshest among the critics, giving the film just one star out five, while the Daily Telegraph gave a more positive three star review. \n \n The budget of W.E. is estimated to be around $15 million, and it hits movie theaters in the United States in December, prompting one journalist to ask Madonna about her Oscar hopes for the film. \n \n \"My legs and my fingers are crossed,\" she quipped. (Reporting by Julie Gordon, editing by Christine Kearney) ||||| Madonna described King Edward VIII as \"very punk rock,\" at the North American opening of her film W.E about his infamous romance with American divorcee Wallis Simpson - and his subsequent abdication. \n \n The singer-turned-film-director was explaining how an anarchist anthem by punk band The Sex Pistols ended up on the soundtrack for her second directorial work, starring British actors James D'Arcy and Andrea Riseborough. \n \n The band's 1977 single \"God Save the Queen\" attacked social conformity and deference to the Crown. \n \n Madonna said: \"I thought he (King Edward VIII) was quite rebellious and cutting edge in his point of view about life and about how to run the empire and using the Sex Pistols was a perfect marriage.\" \n \n In Venice, where the film premiere earlier this month, the Queen of Pop said there were \"elements of myself\" in the film, and said she could sympathise with Wallis as an outsider, an American living in London. \n \n \"I empathize with Wallis. Public figures or icons are often just reduced to a sound-bite, just a handful of attributes. I think people tried to diminish her... I tried to make her human,\" she said in Venice. \n \n At the Toronto International Film Festival, Madonna added that Wallis \"was and is a very provocative character. She is also a mysterious and enigmatic creature, not conventionally beautiful, not young, twice divorced, not anything fabulous about her background and somehow she managed to capture the heart of the man who at the time held the most important position in the world. \n \n \"That story intrigued me immensely and I wanted to understand it.\" \n \n \"But also I was interested in the concept of the cult of celebrity which we are all consumed with now, and then.\" \n \n Polish classical composer Abel Korzeniowski set up the movie's haunting score. \n \n He tried to explain to reporters that Madonna had urged him to \"not try to be talented.\" Madonna interrupted, \"No, I said: 'Don't over-think it.' I always wanted you to be talented.\" \n \n The clash of his classical and Madonna's pop backgrounds, he continued, resulted in \"the most interesting thing.\" \n \n \"I found myself learning very interesting things (from Madonna) about music, which helped me in my classical thinking,\" Korzeniowski added. \n \n During filming, it was also revealed that Madonna and the cast held sing-a-longs \"to pass the time\" during rainy days when shooting was interrupted. \n \n In Toronto, Madonna serenaded journalists with a few impromptu lyrics they had sung together: \"We're making a movie, isn't it groovy, welcome to my house\". \n \n But Madonna has already conquered the music industry, and is more focused on filmmaking now. \n \n \"I had to earn my way ... to be taken seriously in the music department, and now I'm well aware that I have to do the same in the world of film,\" she said, welcoming critics' reviews of her film (not her personal life). \n \n W.E is scheduled for wide release in December at the peak of the pre-Oscar season. \"I'm keeping my legs and fingers crossed\" for a nod, she quipped. ||||| W.E. is Madonna's first film as director and received some negative reviews when it debuted at the Venice Film Festival earlier this month. \n \n Speaking at the Toronto Film Festival, the singer said she wanted reviewers to focus on her work as a director \u2013 not on her personal life. \n \n \"I can tell when people are reviewing my film and when they're reviewing me personally,\" she said. \n \n \"I welcome criticisms of my film when it's viewed as an artistic form and not when people are mentioning things about my personal life or my achievements in any other field because they're irrelevant to the film. So when they stick to the film then I do care, I pay attention to it.\" \n \n Madonna said she has always been fascinated by the relationship between Wallis Simpson and King Edward VIII. Despite being based on true historical figures, the film is not a straight-forward biopic but vacillates between the historical love affair and a contemporary romance between a married woman and a Russian security guard. \n \n While she takes her work seriously, the director said there was plenty of time on set where the cast relaxed with one another. \n \n \"We did have sing alongs. It was a way to pass time. When it was pouring down rain and you were shooting outside and you were stuck inside some grey dirty shack waiting for the sun to come out, what can you do but make up a song.\"",

She grabbed all her girlie clothes in her arms and stuffed them into two big boxes. Half-used lipstick, powder, eye makeup _ she gave them all away. \n \n \"I knew in my heart I was a woman, but I didn't want to die like that,\" says Evie, now 66, her lips trembling slightly as the memories flood back. \"So I decided to just accept it. ... I've been living like this, a man, ever since.\" \n \n Indonesia's attitude toward transgenders is complex. \n \n Nobody knows how many of them live in the sprawling archipelagic nation of 240 million, but activists estimate 7 million. Because Indonesia is home to more Muslims than any other country in the world, the pervasiveness of men who live as women and vice versa often catches newcomers by surprise. They hold the occasional pageant, work as singers or at salons and include well-known celebrity talk show host Dorce Gamalama. \n \n However, societal disdain still runs deep _ when transgenders act in TV comedies, they are invariably the brunt of the joke. They have taken a much lower profile in recent years, following a series of attacks by Muslim hard-liners. And the country's highest Islamic body has decreed that they are required to live as they were born because each gender has obligations to fulfill, such as reproduction. \n \n \"They must learn to accept their nature,\" says Ichwan Syam, a prominent Muslim cleric at the influential Indonesian Ulema Council. \"If they are not willing to cure themselves medically and religiously\" they have \"to accept their fate to be ridiculed and harassed.\" \n \n Many transgenders turn to prostitution because jobs are hard to find and because they want to live according to what they believe is their true gender. In doing so, they put themselves at risk of contracting AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. \n \n Some, like Evie, have decided it's better to hide their feelings. Others are pushing back. Last month, a 50-year-old Indonesian transvestite applied to be the next leader of the national human rights commission, showing up in a borrowed luxury vehicle with paparazzi cameras flashing as she stepped out. \n \n \"I'm too ugly to be a prostitute,\" Yuli Retoblaut said, chuckling. \"But I can be their bodyguard.\" \n \n The threat of violence is very real: Indonesia's National Commission for Human Rights receives about 1,000 reports of abuses per year, ranging from murder and rape to the disruption to group activities. Worldwide, at least one person is killed every other day, according to the Trans Murder Monitoring Project, which collects homicide reports. \n \n Evie says she chose her current name because she thought it sounded sweet. But she adds, as she pulls out her national identification card, her official name is Turdi and gender male. Several longtime residents of Obama's old Menteng neighborhood confirmed that Turdi had worked there as his nanny for two years, also caring for his baby sister Maya. When asked about the nanny, the White House had no comment. \n \n Evie, who like many Indonesians goes by a single name, now lives in a closet-sized hovel in a tightly packed slum in an eastern corner of Jakarta, collecting and scrubbing dirty laundry to pay for food. She wears baggy blue jeans and a white T-shirt advertising a tranquil beach resort far away in a place she's never been. She speaks softly, politely, and a deep worry line is etched between her eyes. \n \n As a child, Evie was often beaten by a father who couldn't stand having such a \"sissy\" for a son. \n \n \"He wanted me to act like a boy, even though I didn't feel it in my soul,\" she says. \n \n Teased and bullied, she dropped out of school after the third grade and decided to learn how to cook. \n \n As it turned out, she was pretty good at it, making her way into the kitchens of several high-ranking officials by the time she was a teenager, she recalls with a smile and a wink. And so it was, at a cocktail party in 1969, that she met Ann Dunham, Barack Obama's mother, who had arrived in the country two years earlier after marrying her second husband, Indonesian Lolo Soetoro. \n \n Dunham was so impressed by Evie's beef steak and fried rice that she offered her a job in the family home. It didn't take long before Evie also was 8-year-old Barry's caretaker, playing with him and bringing him to and from school. \n \n Neighbors recalled that they often saw Evie leave the house in the evening fully made up and dressed in drag. But she says it's doubtful Barry ever knew. \n \n \"He was so young,\" says Evie. \"And I never let him see me wearing women's clothes. But he did see me trying on his mother's lipstick, sometimes. That used to really crack him up.\" \n \n When the family left in the early 1970s, things started going downhill. She moved in with a boyfriend. That relationship ended three years later, and she became a sex worker. \n \n \"I tried to get a job as a maid, but no one would hire me,\" says Evie. \"I needed money to buy food, get a place to stay.\" \n \n It was a cat-and-mouse game with security guards and _ because the country was still under the dictatorship of Gen.

Though the lifestyle is very much in the public eye\u2014a major talk-show host is transgendered\u2014attacks have mounted in recent years, and the country's top Islamic organization has condemned the transgender lifestyle, the AP reports. \"They must learn to accept their nature\" or \"accept their fate to be ridiculed and harassed,\" says a top cleric. As a child, Evie dropped out of school and pursued a career in cooking, eventually finding work as a cook for Obama's mother in 1969. During that time, she became a de facto nanny to an 8-year-old Barack and sister Maya. And though she often went out at night dressed as a woman, \"I never let him see me wearing women's clothes. But he did see me trying on his mother's lipstick, sometimes. That used to really crack him up.\" But after the family moved away, Evie fell on hard times and ultimately became a sex worker. Today, she says she doesn't \"have a future anymore\" and is simply counting down the days until she dies. Still, when she found out that Obama had become president, \"I couldn't believe my eyes,\" she notes. \"Now when people call me scum, I can just say: 'But I was the nanny for the president of the United States!'\"",

She says soldiers shaved her long, black hair to the scalp and smashed out glowing cigarettes onto her hands and arms. The turning point came when she found a transgender friend's bloated body floating in a backed-up sewage canal two decades ago. She grabbed all her girlie clothes in her arms and stuffed them into two big boxes. Half-used lipstick, powder, eye makeup\u2014she gave them all away. \"I knew in my heart I was a woman, but I didn't want to die like that,\" says Evie, now 66, her lips trembling slightly. \"So I decided to just accept it. ... I've been living like this, a man, ever since.\" Indonesia's attitude toward transgenders is complex. Nobody knows how many of them live in the sprawling archipelagic nation of 240 million, but activists estimate 7 million. Because Indonesia is home to more Muslims than any other country in the world, the pervasiveness of men who live as women and vice versa often catches by surprise. They hold the occasional pageant, work as singers or at salons, and include well-known celebrity talk show host Dorce Gamalama. However, societal disdain still runs deep\u2014when transgenders act in TV comedies, they are invariably the brunt of the joke. Last month, a 50-year-old Indonesian transvestite applied to be the next leader of the national human rights commission. \"I'm too ugly. I'm too ugly.\"",

[Post updated throughout day.] \n \n From Europe to the Americas to, well, my house in Australia, users (mostly of older \"Fat\" consoles, those released before 2009's \"PS3 Slim\") have been complaining since Sunday that upon booting their consoles up, they're unable to sign into their accounts, check their trophies, use dynamic themes or access the PlayStation Network. That's fine, Sony say there are PSN connection problems, and that they are \"looking into it\". \n \n Problem is, the error does more than just prevent you from going online. It prevents you from playing certain games offline as well. Even for some consoles that aren't connected to the PSN, like debug units. The screen above is what I was greeted with on a retail console when attempting to play Heavy Rain, and pressing out of it simply reboots the PS3, returning you to the main menu screen. It's the same story for other games that feature dynamic trophy support. \n \n PSN games are no different; I tried to boot up \"Flower\", only to be greeted with a similar message about failed copyright protection, and it was right back to the XMB. \n \n Sony say \"stay tuned\" for updates on the problem. In turn, we've emailed Sony for comment and will update if we hear anything more. \n \n While theories abound that this has something to do with the calendar on older PS3s (some users are reporting their date/time settings have been reset), bear in mind Sony has redesigned its PlayStation website over the weekend, so it could be the result of some tinkering under the hood for the PlayStation Network. Then again, if consoles not connected to the PSN are also affected, it could be something else. Who knows! \n \n Whatever it is, though, you have to wonder at the design process that turns a network outage into something stopping you from playing an offline, singleplayer title. \n \n UPDATE - Sony has updated, saying \"We're narrowing down the issue and continue to work to restore service to all. Updates as soon as we have them.\" \n \n UPDATE 2 - A mass story-telling session on internet gaming forum NeoGAF points towards the issue potentially being related to a calendar bug in older PlayStation 3 consoles, not the PlayStation Network as was first suspected. Bear in mind this is mob science, however, and is by no means official confirmation on the cause of the problem. \n \n UPDATE 3 - Citing unnamed \"developers and studios\", British site Develop say that the issue is affecting titles currently in production for the PlayStation 3, with debug consoles - used by developers to actually make games - thrown \"into a rebooting cycle, due to an endlessly-looping error message\". \n \n UPDATE 4 - PS3's still aren't working, and there has been no official update from Sony in over 9 hours. Their last Twitter update says that they believe the issue does not appear to be impacting PS3 Slim consoles. \n \n \n \n UPDATE 5 (8:20 am Mountain Time) - Sony U.S. silent since Sunday, but PlayStation Europe Tweets three times in the past hour: \"Rest assured, we've many people working on fixing this issue.

On Twitter this means @PlayStationEU and @SonyPlayStation.\" and then \"We will be updating you the second we have some news.\" \n \n UPDATE 6: Error code 8001050F was causes by a fault in the PS3's clock functionality, Sony tells Kotaku. A fix should be coming within 24 hours. Until then, stay off your console, they say.

Novak and John C. Reilly, is slated to be released May 11. ||||| Will Sacha Baron Cohen\u2019s \u2018The Dictator\u2019 Walk The Oscar Red Carpet? \n \n UPDATED 5:30 PM WITH MORE DETAILS \n \n EXCLUSIVE\u2026 BREAKING 3PM\u2026 The Academy Of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences has pulled actor Sacha Baron Cohen\u2018s tickets from the 84th Academy Awards. This means he is banned from attending the Oscars even though he is an Academy member and one of the stars from Hugo, Paramount\u2019s 11-nominated movie and Best Picture contender. \u201cUnless they\u2019re assured that nothing entertaining is going to happen on the Red Carpet, the Academy is not admitting Sacha Baron Cohen to the show,\u201d Paramount just told me. The reason is that a proposal reached the Academy for Baron Cohen to strut the Red Carpet in full costume as his title character in the upcoming Paramount comedy The Dictator. UPDATE AT 5:30 PM: Later today, faced with all the bad publicity resulting from its action, the Academy tried to parse what it did when questioned by some media outlets. But the fact is that, this morning, the Academy\u2019s Managing Director Of Membership Kimberly Rouch phoned Paramont\u2019s awards staff to say Baron Cohen\u2019s tickets had been pulled unless he gives the Academy assurances ahead of time promising not to show up on the Red Carpet in costume and not to promote the movie on the Red Carpet. The Academy made it clear that, without those assurances, it would not issue him the tickets. So he\u2019s banned.* \n \n Of course, the next best thing to that publicity stunt is all the media coverage which this ban is going to generate for Baron Cohen\u2019s film. So the Academy has decided to act like dictators about the actor playing The Dictator. Ugh. \n \n Sancha Baron Cohen Today Show Video \n \n Loosen up, people. Frankly, the Academy looks like uptight wankers with this treatment of one of the globe\u2019s funniest comedians. The Academy merely had to say no when that proposal was presented to it. Everyone involved in the ceremony was adamantly against it on the grounds that it makes a mockery of what Hollywood considers its most prestigious event. Instead, the Academy clearly wants another overly long, ridiculously reverential show about movies no one bothered to see where the best thing about the telecast will be the comeback of popular host Billy Crystal at age 63. \n \n UPDATE: Is Academy Blinking On Banning Sacha Baron Cohen From Oscars 2012? \n \n The Dictator is a spoof about the \u201cheroic story of a Middle Eastern dictator who risks his life to ensure that democracy never comes to the country he so lovingly oppressed\u201d. Whether the fact that the 84th Academy Awards will be beamed into 200 countries had anything to do with this ban is unclear. But it is highly unusual for the Academy to pull a member\u2019s tickets. An Oscars spokesperson acknowledged to Deadline yesterday: \u201dWe would hope that every studio knows that this is a bad idea. The Red Carpet is not about stunting.\u201d Oh really? Then why did Trey Parker and Matt Stone of South Park crossdress down the Red Carpet as J-Lo and Gwyneth Paltrow in evening gowns in 2000? Or Ben Stiller appear as an Oscar presenter in full blue Avatar makeup and hair in 2010? \n \n Deadline reported yesterday that Baron Cohen\u2019s plan was to come dressed as The Dictator and then change into a tuxedo and attend the Oscars as planned. He wasn\u2019t scheduled to present an award, but he was arriving at Kodak Theatre as part of the Paramount contingent. Now he can\u2019t do even that. Paramount has a Best Picture nominee in the Martin Scorsese-directed Hugo in which Baron Cohen plays the train station inspector of the movie about an orphan in 1930s Paris. \n \n At the 2007 Oscars, Baron Cohen was asked to be a presenter and said he would do it only if he could be in character as Borat. And Oscars\u2019 Powers That Be said, \u201cNo way.\u201d He didn\u2019t attend. But this is the first time he has been officially banned from the show. \n \n Purists feel that the Oscars is no place for such in your face promotion. The Academy hasn\u2019t even allowed movies to be advertised during the Oscarcast, until this year. Then again, these Oscars have very little suspense because it\u2019s a forgone conclusion that many of the winners of the marquee categories are already known and The Artist will win Best Picture. The prospect of Baron Cohen\u2019s Red Carpet walk was the closest thing to drama. \n \n This would not have been Baron Cohen\u2019s first time upstaging an awards show. To promote Bruno, he flew through the air at the MTV Movie Awards and landed with his crotch in the face of Eminem, who later admitted the stunt was rehearsed. And a trailer for The Dictator certainly was one of the raciest ever allowed by the MPAA during the Super Bowl, where Baron Cohen\u2019s character was hilariously depicted running a competitive race while and leg-shooting rivals with a starter pistol as they got close to him. \n \n Editor-in-Chief Nikki Finke - tip her here. ||||| Contrary to reports, the Academy has not yet pulled Sacha Baron Cohen's Oscar tickets over his plan to appear on the red carpet in character for his next movie \u2014 but that could still happen \n \n According to an executive with the Academy who did not wish to be identified, AMPAS officials have been in touch with representatives for Baron Cohen since they learned of his plan to attend the Oscars in costume as the title character in \"The Dictator.\" \n \n Their message to British comic was clear: \"Our red carpet is not for stunting.\" \n \n The Academy is now waiting for a response from Baron Cohen's camp; once they receive one, they will decide whether he can use the tickets he received as a cast member of the Best Picture nominee \"Hugo.\" \n \n Baron Cohen would have done red carpet interviews in character \u2013 and if his past appearances as Borat and Bruno were any indication, would have used the occasion to be disruptive (and probably pretty funny). \n \n Also read: 'The Dictator' Trailer: Sacha Baron Cohen Laughs in the Face of Tyranny (Video) \n \n Baron Cohen caused problems for the Oscars four years ago, when they asked him to present but he insisted on doing so only in character, as Borat. The Academy refused. \n \n The Oscars have a history of being uncomfortable with the unpredictable. Last year, AMPAS executives were worried that Banksy, director of the nominated documentary \"Exit Through the Gift Shop,\" would try to take the stage in disguise. \n \n Speaking of a conversation he had with representatives for the elusive graffiti artist, Academy president Tom Sherak said, \"We suggested to them that it might be a good idea that if he did win, one of them would accept in his place \u2013 that it would not be dignified for the Academy to have somebody come up wearing a monkey's head.\" \n \n (Angry reps for Banksy disputed that he ever wore a monkey mask in public.) \n \n Also read: Steve Pond's Oscar Picks: 'The Artist' Will Win, but Should It? \n \n The Academy wasn't amused in 2000, when Best Song nominees Trey Parker and Matt Stone (\"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut\") showed up in knockoffs of the famous awards-show gowns worn by Jennifer Lopez and Gwyneth Paltrow. \n \n Parker and Stone had not cleared their plan with the Academy before that show \u2013 and, they said, they got plenty of dirty looks (plus a thumbs-up from Michael Caine) as they walked the red carpet. \n \n Baron Cohen was reportedly planning to do something similar, wearing his \"Dictator\" outfit for an in-character trip down the red carpet and then changing into a tux for the show. \n \n Using an Oscar appearance to promote an upcoming film is not, of course, completely unknown. This year's host, Billy Crystal, did just that in 1991 when he made his entrance on a horse before the release of \"City Slickers,\" and Ben Stiller appeared onstage in his \"Starsky and Hutch\" costume in 2004. \n \n But those were onstage, where it was sanctioned and controlled. The red carpet is something else \u2013 out there, the Academy doesn't like wild cards.

The woman, who worked at Laughlin Air Force Base, in Del Rio, Texas, was killed during the explosion of a truck and trailer loaded with airbag cartridges near Quemado, Texas. \n \n Forensic tests confirmed the identity of the woman who passed away Monday morning. Dental pieces found at the scene were analyzed by the Medical Examiner in Laredo, Texas. Robles was pronounced dead this Wednesday morning, at 11:35 a.m. by Justice of Peace June Smith. \n \n The Maverick County Sheriff\u2019s Department announced that the two-day search comes to an end. \n \n According to authorities the woman, who lived alone at her home located on U.S. Highway 277, near the intersection with FM 1666, was alone Monday morning, when the truck came off the road, caught on fire and exploded just in front of the structure. \n \n The truck, hauling a flatbed trailer loaded with airbag cartridges, was traveling from Del Rio to the Takata plant in Eagle Pass, Texas. The driver of the truck, identified as Mario Alberto Rodriguez, 20-years-of-age, was injured along with a passenger. They were able to flee the truck before the blast. \n \n An older couple, traveling in a Toyota SUV, was also injured during the explosion. All four injured victims were transported to a hospital in Eagle Pass, and later airlifted to San Antonio. \n \n The blast damaged some 10 nearby homes, breaking windows and dislodging doors from their hinges. Pieces of rubble and truck parts were found almost 1 mile away from the place of the explosion. \n \n The blast cratered the ground and damaged the road, causing the closure of U.S. Hwy 277 for some 30 hours on and off. ||||| In last week\u2019s accident, which occurred in the early hours of Aug. 22, the woman who died, Lucila Robles, 69, was apparently in her home in the town of Quemado, on the Mexico border, when the crash occurred on the road in front of her property before dawn. \n \n Photo \n \n The blast destroyed the home. The sheriff\u2019s office sent out search parties for Ms. Robles, thinking she may have been carried by the force of the explosion into nearby brush. \n \n Investigators called off the search after two days when they discovered Ms. Robles\u2019s bones, teeth and other remains in the smoldering debris of her house, said Tom Schmerber, the local sheriff for the county of Maverick. Also injured were the two drivers of the truck, who fled their vehicle after it swerved off the road and crashed, and two passers-by in a car. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n An internal document provided by a former Takata employee shows that Takata transports its explosive compound more than 2,000 miles across the United States, from its propellant-manufacturing plant in Moses Lake, Wash., to a distribution center just north of the Mexico border in Eagle Pass, Tex. \n \n The 36-hour journey, manned by two drivers, takes the truck through Boise, Idaho, and Salt Lake City, as well as Albuquerque and Santa Fe, N.M., according to the document, dated October 2007. From Eagle Pass, the propellant is transferred to separate trucks that then travel to Takata\u2019s airbag factory in Monclova, Mexico, according to the document. \n \n Drivers of the trucks are required to be equipped with fire-resistant clothing, steel-toed boots with rubber soles, safety goggles and helmets, the document says, pointing to the hazardous nature of the cargo. \n \n Takata said the trucks were carrying the propellant alongside airbag components called inflaters, which are small devices within an airbag that contain the explosive material and which are designed to cause an airbag to inflate in microseconds. The inflaters aboard the truck were newly manufactured, the company said. \n \n 50 miles 10 TEXAS San Antonio Quemado 37 Eagle Pass 35 MEXICO Rio Grande Monclova 281 \n \n In a statement, a spokesman for Takata, Jared Levy, said the company followed all regulatory requirements. \n \n Glenn P. Wicks, managing director at the Wicks Group, a law firm based in the District of Columbia that specializes in hazmat transportation, said it was not immediately clear whether any federal safety regulations were violated in Takata\u2019s shipping of the propellant and inflaters. Given the severity of the crash, he said, the ammonium nitrate propellant could have triggered an explosion by itself, with or without the inflaters present. \n \n Still, investigators are likely to scrutinize how the propellant was packaged and shipped, whether the drivers were certified to handle hazardous materials and whether their working hours were within legal limits, Mr. Wicks said. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Both drivers were injured, along with a couple in a nearby car. The force of the explosion was such that officers searched for the 69-year-old Robles for two days before finding her bones and teeth in the rubble of her destroyed house, a Maverick County sheriff tells the New York Times. Ten other homes were damaged, while debris was found a mile away, per Conexion Del Rio. Takata says the truck contained ammonium nitrate and inflaters\u2014which, combined, allow an airbag to expand. The products were believed to be headed to Takata's distribution center in Eagle Pass, Texas. A Takata rep tells Jalopnik that \"the accident caused a fire, which led to an explosion,\" noting the company \"has strict safety procedures relating to the transportation of its products that meet or exceed all regulatory requirements.\" The Department of Transportation says it is investigating \"the safety compliance of the motor carrier, the handling of the cargo by the shipper, its packaging, how the truck was placarded, as well as the truck's routing.\" (Takata is accused of manipulating testing data.)",

The new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, called the test \u201cunacceptable\u201d. \n \n Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday that Tehran would never use its ballistic missiles to attack another country. \n \n Some 220 Iranian members of parliament reaffirmed support for Tehran\u2019s missile program, calling international condemnation of the tests \u201cillogical.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe Islamic Republic of Iran is against weapons of mass destruction, so its missile capability is the only available deterrence against enemy hostility,\u201d the lawmakers said in a statement carried on state media on Wednesday. \n \n The state news agency IRNA quoted Ali Shamkhani, head of Iran\u2019s National Security Council, as saying Iran would not seek \u201cpermission from any country or international organization for development of our conventional defensive capability\u201d. \n \n The Security Council resolution was adopted to buttress the deal under which Iran curbed its nuclear activities to allay concerns they could be used to develop atomic bombs, in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. \n \n The resolution urged Tehran to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. Critics say the resolution\u2019s language does not make this obligatory. \n \n Tehran says it has not carried out any work on missiles specifically designed to carry nuclear payloads. \n \n The test on Sunday, according to U.S. officials, was of a type of missile that had also been tested seven months ago. \n \n Iran has one of the Middle East\u2019s largest missile programs but it has been dogged by a poor record for accuracy. \n \n However, Hossein Salami, deputy head of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, said on the day of the test that the country was now one of the few whose ballistic missiles were capable of hitting moving objects. \n \n FILE PHOTO: An Iranian national flag flutters during the opening ceremony of the 16th International Oil, Gas & Petrochemical Exhibition (IOGPE) in Tehran April 15, 2011.

They would not say whether Trump wants to pull out of the nuclear deal. \n \n Flynn's message was aimed to get Iran's attention, the officials said. \n \n Last week, Trump included Iran on a list of seven majority-Muslim countries whose citizens would be temporarily banned from entering the United States. \n \n Agreement wasn't meant to make Iran \"thankful to the US\" - it was intended to peacefully rollback Iran's nuclear program, which it did. https://t.co/VAkfctg3Z7 \u2014 Ben Rhodes (@brhodes) February 1, 2017 \n \n Iran used to be prohibited from test-firing ballistic missiles under previous U.N. resolutions. However, these were superseded by a new resolution passed alongside the nuclear deal. \n \n This only \"called upon\" Iran not to test-fire missiles that could be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Critics of the deal say this wording is effectively a loophole meaning the missile-testing restrictions are not obligatory. \n \n The government in Tehran says that because it doesn't have a nuclear-weapons program, its missile tests are not violations of this clause. \n \n Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif didn't confirm or deny the launch during a press conference Tuesday but said, \"The missiles aren't part of the nuclear accords,\" Reuters reported. \"Iran will never use missiles produced in Iran to attack any other country.\" \n \n Flynn's remarks Wednesday followed assertions Tuesday by Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, that the Trump administration would not \"show a blind eye\" to Iran's actions. \n \n \"We're gonna act, we're gonna be strong, we're gonna be loud and we're gonna do whatever it takes to protect the American people and the people across the world, because that's what the goal is supposed to be,\" she said. \n \n Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that he planned to press Trump to renew sanctions against Iran and \"take care of this failed nuclear agreement.\" \n \n He added, \"Iran's aggression must not go unanswered.\" \n \n The National Iranian American Council called Flynn's statement \"reckless,\" and said it risked retaliatory behavior. \n \n \"While Flynn\u2019s remarks could be construed as simply bluster, they will beget an Iranian response which in turn will beget further threats by the U.S.,\" NIAC President Trita Parsi said in a statement. \"At some point, this escalatory cycle that started with bluster may end in war.\"",

    "document": "There was no running gunfight. And the SEALs did not have a kill order. Richard Miniter on the new book detailing the night al Qaeda\u2019s chief died\u2014and the headaches it could cause Obama. \n \n Osama bin Laden did not hear the SEALs\u2019 stealthy helicopter until it hovered over the roof of his three-story home and the chopper\u2019s spinning blades smashed his plastic patio chairs against his bedroom window. \n \n In less than 10 seconds, the SEALs had jumped onto the roof, crawled across the rain-stained tiles, and descended onto bin Laden\u2019s patio. The bearded terror leader sleepily opened his bedroom door and then, spotting two armed men with night-vision gear coming down the hall toward him, quickly slammed it. \n \n They were right behind him. \n \n As the SEALs forced open the bedroom door, they heard bin Laden\u2019s youngest wife screaming in Arabic while raising a blanket to block their view. Behind the rising blanket, they saw bin Laden scrambling for an AKSU machine pistol. \n \n As she tried to shield him, bin Laden shoved his wife into the line of fire. It was the last thing he did. \n \n The first round went into the mattress behind bin Laden. The other three rounds found their mark as the two SEALs fired as one. \n \n Bin Laden\u2019s pistol now hangs on the wall of SEAL Team Six\u2019s Virginia base, beside the photos of comrades killed in action. \n \n These are the kinds of inside details that emerge from Chuck Pfarrer\u2019s new book SEAL Target Geronimo. \n \n Pfarrer certainly had access. A SEAL Team Six assault-element commander in the 1980s, he is known inside the intelligence community for his well-regarded first book, Warrior Soul, and inside Hollywood for writing and producing movies including Navy SEALs, Hard Target, and Virus. He clearly had detailed conversations with senior officers in the SEALs\u2019 chain of command (especially Adm. William McRaven and then\u2013SEAL Team Six commander Scott Kerr) and understands the vocabulary and the culture very well. \n \n But some details in his book could complicate the 2012 presidential race. Pfarrer reports that the White House overruled the Navy plan to have two F-18 Hornets provide air support for SEALs helicopters, which would have been easily shot down if found by Pakistan\u2019s Air Force. Also scrubbed were the latest-generation stealth helicopters, known as \u201cghost hawks.\u201d The SEALs would have to make do with the older Stealth Hawks, which had mechanical problems. Ultimately, one crash-landed due to faulty electronics and had to be demolished on the site. Each of these decisions\u2014to deny fighter support and to use older helicopters\u2014may have been sound. Putting fighters in Pakistani airspace or allowing the Pakistanis to see the latest technology might have complicated relations between America and its Janus-faced ally, Pakistan. Republicans may have been reluctant to attack the president over an achievement that even Dick Cheney applauded. Still, Pfarrer's findings could fuel critics of the president who think he was quick to take personal credit and play politics with the SEALs' successful mission. \n \n Obama may also have trouble explaining why he publicly announced bin Laden\u2019s death just hours after it occurred. The SEALs captured 12 garbage bags worth of notebooks, hard drives, satellite phones, and other digital devices. The data could have been used to launch surprise raids on all the senior members of the al Qaeda network, while the leaders turned on each other and wondered who the traitor was. For the SEALs and other special operators I\u2019ve spoken with, that was the natural next move. Al Qaeda could have been rolled up in six months. Pfarrer captures the SEALs\u2019 resentment of the president, whom they see as publicity-seeking. He ignores the White House\u2019s concerns: the nation had waited almost 10 years for bin Laden to be brought to justice, and that news might have leaked. \n \n Pfarrer also does his best to poke the CIA in the eye. He points out that the agency insisted on having one of its officers in on the raid. While we are repeatedly told that the CIA man had little experience \u201cfast-roping\u201d down for helicopters and doesn\u2019t have the training that the SEALs do (who does?), only in an aside are we informed that he was the only one who could speak Arabic and other local languages. He was the only man who could interview the prisoners or quiet the women and children in the compound. Also, the CIA\u2019s role in locating bin Laden is dismissed in a throwaway paragraph. That\u2019s unfair. The CIA took a few clues from the interrogation of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the operational planner of the 9/11 attacks, and located bin Laden\u2019s trusted courier, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. Then the agency persuaded a colonel in Pakistan\u2019s feared intelligence agency, the ISI, to provide key documents, including the plans for bin Laden\u2019s Abbottabad compound. CIA officers rented apartments and surveilled the bin Laden compound for months, until they could persuade their superiors to deploy satellites. And so on. The CIA\u2019s role in the operation remains an exciting, but untold, story. \n \n SEAL Target Geronimo explodes a number of media myths about the raid to kill bin Laden. \n \n It was not a \u201ckill mission\u201d from the start. The SEALs had no explicit orders to kill the archterrorist and would have captured him if possible. \n \n There was no \u201c45-minute\u201d running gun battle. The SEAL team fired only 12 bullets, and the whole operation lasted only 38 minutes. ||||| Chuck Pfarrer, a former commander of US Navy SEAL Team Six, whose members carried out the assault, claims bin Laden was shot dead almost instantly rather than killed in a 45-minute firefight. \n \n Claiming to have interviewed several men involved in the raid, Pfarrer also contradicted the official account of how the SEAL team landed and how one of their Black Hawk helicopters crashed. \n \n \"The SEALs entered the building after being deposited on the roof by the lead helicopter, not from the ground,\" Pfarrer said in a statement about the book. \n \n \"Only minutes after bin Laden was dead did the lead helicopter, heading for a landing spot, lose altitude and sink, tail-first, into the large walled enclosure east of the main house.\" Pfarrer explains that if the SEALs had been forced to climb stairs to reach bin Laden, as has been officially claimed, he would have had enough warning to arm and effectively defend himself. \n \n \"Bin Laden was dead within 90 seconds of the beginning of the raid, not after an extended firefight,\" Pfrarrer said. \"Four suppressed rounds were fired\". \n \n Pfarrer adds that Amal bin Laden, the al-Qaeda chief's youngest wife, was wounded in the calf during the second round of fire, as she was shoved her in the way of the shooters. This chimes more with an account that was originally stated by US officials in the immediate aftermath of the attack, before later being withdrawn. \n \n Pfarrer describes his book as an \"explosive story of unparallelled valour, clockwork military precision, and deadly accuracy\". But it was dismissed as \"plain wrong\" by US officials. \n \n The book also argues that bin Laden's long-time deputy, Ayman Zawahiri, may have been ultimately responsible for leading the US to his boss because he repeatedly sent a courier, whose cover he must have known had already been blown, in and out of the compound. \n \n A trusted Kuwaiti courier, Abu Ahmad, is believed to have been followed by US officials for several months before the raid after his name emerged in interrogations of other al-Qaeda suspects and he was tracked down to Abbottabad. \n \n The book, which is due to be released later this month, is said to have been delayed for several weeks while being cleared by government officials. \n \n Its British edition is being revised due to concerns that individuals named may sue the author for libel.",

The clashes came after the Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s Freedom and Justice Party called thousands of its members into the streets in a counter-demonstration to drive opposition movements from the presidential palace. \n \n Shoving and punching spilled down a boulevard as hurled stones, swinging sticks and firebombs filled the dusk in one of the capital\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods. Pro-Morsi contingents, including Brotherhood followers and ultraconservative Salafis, chased opposition activists shouting: \u201cGod is great. The people support the president\u2019s decision.\u201d \n \n More than 125 people were injured on a cityscape that had the charged air of a flourescent-lit battlefield with competing banners, bandaged men and dinner trays used as shields to block barrages of rocks. \n \n Police were slow to react but eventually arrived and attempted to separate the two sides even as the skirmishes raised fears that animosity between Islamists and the mainly secular opposition were a dangerous foreshadowing. Both camps threatened to march against each other and there appeared little compromise in a battle over the nation\u2019s future that symbolizes the larger struggle over political Islam rising from the Arab Spring. \n \n \u201cVicious attack vs. peaceful protesters in front of presidential palace,\u201d tweeted Mohamed ElBaradei, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and opposition leader. \u201cRegime leading Egypt into violence and bloodshed.\u201d \n \n The clashes revealed new cracks in Morsi\u2019s government from officials disturbed by the power and meddling of the Brotherhood. Three presidential advisors resigned, including Seif Abdel-Fattah, who told the Egyptian media: \u201cEgypt is bigger than a narrow-minded elite .... We can no longer stay silent because they [the Brotherhood] have harmed the nation and the revolution.\u201d \n \n Tensions began two weeks ago when Morsi, a former Brotherhood leader, issued a decree that expanded his powers and protected the Islamist-dominated constitutional assembly from judicial oversight. The country\u2019s highest court was expected to dissolve the assembly but delegates quickly finished a draft constitution that Morsi ordered be put to a national referendum Dec. 15. \n \n Opposition factions marched on the presidential palace Tuesday to protest Morsi\u2019s authority and the charter, which they say would open the country to Islamic law and a scaling back of civil rights. The demonstration angered the Brotherhood, which on Saturday avoided confrontation with the opposition by holding a massive rally miles away from Tahrir Square, where anti-Morsi movements have made their base. \n \n But the Brotherhood on Wednesday was more aggressive: \u201cThe president will not retreat, and if the state apparatus is weakened by the wounds of the previous period, then the people can impose their will and protect legitimacy,\u201d said Essam Erian, deputy head of the Freedom and Justice Party. \n \n Police actions questioned after Mexican inauguration protests \n \n Israel moves forward with controversial West Bank development \n \n Indian Olympic officials defy IOC, pick corruption suspect as leader \n \n Special correspondent Gaser El Safty contributed to this report. ||||| CAIRO\u2014Tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of Egypt's president clashed Wednesday, hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails and brawling in Cairo's streets, in the largest violent battle between Islamists and their foes since the country's revolution early last year. \n \n The confrontation started in the evening after Islamist protesters marching in support of President Mohammed Morsi, a former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, moved to break up a demonstration by the president's non-Islamist opponents outside the presidential palace in Cairo, where Mr. Morsi has his offices. \n \n Supporters of the rival camps, spurred by public defiance by influential figures on each side, waged back-and-forth battles in side streets outside the palace walls as night fell, shutting down major thoroughfares. Around midnight, police formed a barrier between the camps, with thousands of demonstrators on each side, as gunshots rang out and each side accused the other of firing live rounds. \n \n Those allegations couldn't be confirmed. More than 120 people were wounded, Egyptian medics said late Wednesday. The Muslim Brotherhood said at least one of its supporters had been killed, while opposition officials said two of their supporters had died. A local television channel, ONTV, showed images of two people it said were killed in the clashes, and said violence was spreading elsewhere in Cairo. \n \n The Obama administration exhorted the sides to respect each other and refrain from bloodshed. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, speaking in Brussels, called for a two-way dialogue. She also expressed dismay at the constitutional process, saying Egyptians \"deserve a constitutional process that is open, transparent and fair and does not unduly favor one group over any other.\" \n \n Also in Cairo, crowds besieged the Brotherhood headquarters in the al Moqatam neighborhood, ONTV said. Protesters also burned down a Brotherhood headquarters in the Suez Canal town of Ismailiya, Egyptian media reported. \n \n The conflict between Islamists and their opponents has been behind some of the Middle East's bloodiest civil wars. Those who battled in the shadow of Cairo's presidential palace mirrored Egypt's secular-Islamist divide\u2014with a crowd of mixed-gender and mainly young Egyptians, many in tight jeans and hipster haircuts, facing off against men in conservative dress shirts or robes and skullcaps. \n \n Egypt's opposition was galvanized last month when Mr. Morsi issued a decree granting him nearly unrestricted powers and placing him above the judiciary. The decree paved the way for hurried approval of a constitution that was drafted by an Islamist-dominated body that the opposition says was working illegitimately and produced a charter weighted with Islamic law. The government has set a referendum on the draft for Dec. 15. \n \n Anti-Morsi Egyptians took to the streets. On Tuesday, they marched on the presidential palace to denounce Mr. Morsi, the first time in recent memory that protesters made it to the palace walls. On Wednesday, Muslim Brotherhood leader Essam El-Eryan, speaking on al-Jazeera, called on millions of Egyptians to go to the presidential palace to \"defend the state and its legitimacy.\" \n \n Mohamed ElBaradei, one of the leaders of the opposition, countered on Wednesday that Mr. Morsi had lost all legitimacy. The president, he said, bears full responsibility for the current violence and is in danger of drawing Egypt into \"something worse.\" \n \n Speaking in a televised press conference, Mr. ElBaradei was flanked by Egypt's top opposition leaders, including ex-Arab League chief Amr Moussa and Hamdeen Sabahi, both former presidential candidates. It was a rare show of unity by Egypt's historically fractured opposition forces. \n \n \"We will not enter any dialogue until the constitutional decree is rescinded and the constitutional referendum is postponed,\" said Mr. ElBaradei, adding that they will pursue \"any means necessary\" to restore democracy and dignity to Egypt. \n \n A Muslim Brotherhood spokesman, Gehad al-Haddad, accused Mr. ElBaradei and other opposition leaders of inciting violence. He wouldn't rule out that Mr. Morsi could order their arrest on those grounds. \n \n Egypt's public prosecutor, who was appointed by Mr. Morsi, on Tuesday ordered an investigation into allegations by a private citizen that Messrs. ElBaradei, Sabahi and Moussa, among other opposition leaders, were conspiring with Zionists to overthrow Mr. Morsi's government. The three didn't address the allegations. \n \n At the palace early Thursday, police fired tear gas into a crowd that was divided by the newly erected cordon. \n \n Many in the anti-Morsi camp accused the Muslim Brotherhood supporters who arrived Wednesday evening of inciting violence against peaceful protesters. Islam Hassan, a 26-year-old clothing-store manager, said he would stay at the site until Mr. Morsi rescinded his extraordinary powers. \n \n On the other side of the cordon, a larger group of men who characterized themselves as Muslim Brotherhood supporters also said they would remain at the site. They characterized the anti-Morsi protesters as thugs paid by former regime insiders to bring down an elected leader. \n \n \"The problem is that these people could say no in the [Dec. 15 constitutional] referendum, but they don't want a referendum,\" said Morsi supporter Ahmed Abdel Khaleq, a 29-year-old accountant. \"They don't want a democracy.\" \n \n Early Thursday, hundreds of pro-Morsi protesters had spread blankets on the hard pavement in front of the palace, preparing to spend a night in the rough to hold their territory. Members of the pro-Morsi crowd were also seen pummeling and dragging a man they characterized as an opposition thug. \n \n The administration of Mr. Morsi, who hasn't appeared in public since he left the presidential palace after protesters descended on Tuesday, has sent out confused messages about how the conflict could be resolved. His vice president, Mahmoud Mekki, in remarks to reporters Wednesday, offered to sit down and negotiate with the opposition. He later said the proposal was his own, not a formal government offer. He said the referendum on the constitution would go forward as planned. \n \n As the crisis deepened, three of Mr. Morsi's aides, tapped from outside the Muslim Brotherhood, quit in protest. \"Egypt is bigger than a narrow-minded elite,\" one of the aides, Seif Abdel Fattah, told Egyptian television. He added that he could \"no longer stay silent because the Muslim Brotherhood had harmed the nation and the revolution.\" \n \n \u2014Sam Dagher in Cairo \n \n and Stephen Fidler in Brussels contributed to this article. \n \n Printed in The Wall Street Journal, page A1 ||||| Egyptian Army deploy near the presidential palace to secure the site of overnight clashes between supporters and opponents of President Mohammed Morsi in Cairo, Egypt, Thursday, Dec. 6, 2012. The Egyptian... (Associated Press) \n \n The Egyptian army deployed tanks outside the presidential palace Thursday following fierce street battles between supporters and opponents of Mohammed Morsi that left five people dead and more than 600 injured in the worst outbreak of violence between the two sides since the Islamist leader's election. \n \n The intensity of the overnight violence, with Morsi's Islamist backers and largely secular protesters lobbing firebombs and rocks at each other, signaled a turning point in the 2-week-old crisis over the president's assumption of near-absolute powers and the hurried adoption of a draft constitution. \n \n Opposition activists defiantly called for another protest outside the palace later Thursday, raising the specter of more bloodshed as neither side showed willingness to back down. \n \n Morsi was in the palace Thursday conducting business as usual, according to a presidential official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to address the media. \n \n Egypt has seen sporadic clashes throughout nearly two years of political turmoil after the ouster of autocratic leader Hosni Mubarak. But Wednesday's street battles were the worst between Morsi's supporters and followers and came after an implicit call by the Muslim Brotherhood for its members to go to the palace and evict anti-Morsi protesters who had camped out there. \n \n Unlike Mubarak, Morsi was elected in June after a narrow victory in Egypt's first free presidential elections, but many activists who supported him have jumped to the opposition after he issued decrees on Nov. 22 that put him above oversight and a draft charter was later rushed through by his Islamist allies despite a walkout by Christian and liberal factions. \n \n Compounding Morsi's woes, four of his advisers resigned Wednesday, joining two other members of his 17-member advisory panel who have abandoned him since the crisis began. \n \n Six tanks and two armored vehicles belonging to the Republican Guard, an elite unit tasked with protecting the president and his palaces, were stationed Thursday morning at roads leading to the palace in the upscale Cairo district of Heliopolis. The guard's commander, Maj. Gen. Mohammed Zaki, sought to assure Egyptians that his forces were not taking sides. \n \n \"They will not be a tool to crush protesters and no force will be used against Egyptians,\" he said in comments carried by the official MENA news agency. \n \n The situation was calm Thursday morning, with thousands of Morsi supporters camping outside the palace after driving away opposition activists who had been staging a sit-in there, prompting fierce street battles that spread to residential areas. \n \n \"I don't want Morsi to back down,\" said Khaled Omar, a Brotherhood supporter. \"We are not defending him, we are defending Islam, which is what people want.\" \n \n Other Brotherhood supporters outside the palace accused opposition protesters of being Mubarak loyalists or foot soldiers in a coup attempt. \n \n \"They want to take over power in a coup. They are conspiring against Morsi and we want him to crack down on them,\" said one, Ezzedin Khoudir. \"There must be arrests.\" \n \n The violence began when the Brotherhood called on its members to head to the presidential palace to \"defend legitimacy\" and protect it against what a statement termed attempts by the opposition to impose its will by force. In response, thousands descended on the area, chasing away some 300 opposition protesters who had been staging a peaceful sit-in outside the palace's main gate. Clashes later ensued with the two sides using rocks, sticks and firebombs. \n \n State television quoted the Health Ministry as saying Thursday that five people were killed and 644 injured by beatings, gunshot wounds and tear gas inhalation. \n \n Morsi, meanwhile, seemed determined to press forward with plans for a Dec. 15 constitutional referendum to pass the new charter. The opposition, for its part, is refusing dialogue unless Morsi rescinds the decrees giving him near unrestricted powers and shelves the controversial draft constitution, which the president's Islamist allies rushed through last week in a marathon, all-night session shown live on state TV. \n \n Mohamed ElBaradei, a leading opposition reform advocate, said late Wednesday that Morsi's rule was \"no different\" than Mubarak's. \n \n \"In fact, it is perhaps even worse,\" the Nobel Peace Prize laureate told a news conference after he accused the president's supporters of a \"vicious and deliberate\" attack on peaceful demonstrators outside the palace. \n \n \"Cancel the constitutional declarations, postpone the referendum, stop the bloodshed, and enter a direct dialogue with the national forces,\" he wrote on his Twitter account, addressing Morsi. \n \n Wednesday's violence spread to other parts of the country. Anti-Morsi protesters stormed and set ablaze the Brotherhood offices in Suez and Ismailia, east of Cairo, and clashes broke out in the industrial city of Mahallah and the province of Menoufiyah in the Nile Delta north of the capital. \n \n Rival demonstrations also were held outside the Brotherhood's headquarters in the Cairo suburb of Moqatam and security officials said senior Brotherhood official Sobhi Saleh was hospitalized in Alexandria after being severely beaten by Morsi opponents. Saleh, a former lawmaker, played a key role in drafting the disputed constitution. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.",

Katehi insisted Tuesday that the school's police department defied her orders when it used force against students in last week's pepper-spray fiasco. \n \n \"We told the police to remove the tents or the equipment,\" Katehi said in an interview with The Bee in her office inside the administration building, which remains locked down to the public. \n \n \"We told them very specifically to do it peacefully, and if there were too many of them, not to do it, if the students were aggressive, not to do it. And then we told them we also do not want to have another Berkeley.\" \n \n In her most expansive comments since Friday's attempt to remove the tents spiraled into the pepper-spraying of students, Katehi said she still does not know who decided to use pepper spray and was stunned when she first saw video clips of it Friday night. \n \n \"It looked horrible, horrific, I would say , \" Katehi said. \"I can tell you that I woke up Saturday really early in the morning, like 3 a.m., and I felt like it was a disaster on our hands.\" \n \n She also said she never would have approved the use of full-scale riot gear by officers sent in to remove the students and that Police Chief Annette Spicuzza was part of an emergency conference call before the incident. \n \n \"We told her that it has to be peaceful, that anything else would not be acceptable,\" Katehi said one day after Spicuzza was placed on administrative leave along with two officers who used the pepper spray. \n \n Spicuzza did not respond to a message left at her home Tuesday, but she has previously said the officers used the pepper spray because they were being cut off from other police by the students. Video clips that have surfaced so far do not show that happening. \n \n Katehi said Spicuzza indicated Saturday that it was Lt. John Pike who decided to use the pepper spray. \n \n \"I believe on Saturday when I spoke with her I said, 'What happened?' \" Katehi said. \"She tried to explain that it was the decision of Lt. Pike.\" \n \n Pike's voice mail has been full since Sunday, and he could not be reached. \n \n Video clips of the officers spraying students who were sitting peacefully on the ground have been viewed online by millions of people since Friday and resulted in widespread calls for Katehi to resign. \n \n She has resisted those calls and met with student groups several times Tuesday, including an afternoon session at which she called for all charges against 10 individuals in Friday's incident \u0096 nine of them students \u0096 to be dropped. \n \n She also said UC Davis and the UC system would cover all medical expenses incurred by students who were pepper- sprayed. \n \n The effort last Friday to remove the campers, who had gathered to protest tuition hikes as a part of the growing Occupy Wall Street movement, backfired almost immediately. \n \n After a Monday rally attended by thousands of students, faculty and others at which Katehi apologized, groups once again began to erect tents on the quad. By Tuesday, there were more than 75 tents, and Katehi said she would seek negotiations to coax them into leaving rather than take renewed police action. \n \n Meanwhile, she has ordered police to remain ready to help campers if some sort of emergency arises, but to stay out of sight. \n \n \"They are on call, but they are not visible,\" she said, adding that the school has brought in portable restrooms and is looking into providing facilities for food and drink to maintain a healthy environment. \n \n Katehi visited the growing encampment at least twice on Tuesday with mixed results. In the morning, she said, she was able to speak with 20 to 30 students and \"had a very good discussion.\" \n \n She was invited back about 11 a.m. during the group's general assembly. But after she waited quietly for 20 minutes, the students could not agree on whether to deviate from their agenda to allow her to speak and she finally walked away. \n \n On her way back to her office, Katehi was greeted by a number of students who expressed their support for her and said they do not believe she had approved of officers using force against the students. \n \n \"She was worried about the safety of the students,\" said Kiran Ashan, a psychology junior. \n \n \"And I just feel that those (campers), some of them are from Occupy Sacramento, they're not even Davis students,\" Ashan said. \"What are they doing on a Davis campus? \n \n The use of force by campus police at Davis and Berkeley against protesters has resulted in a systemwide review by UC officials, and the Legislature agreed Tuesday to hold hearings on the matter. \n \n In addition, UC President Mark Yudof announced that he has asked William Bratton, who has headed police forces in Los Angeles, Boston and New York, to conduct an independent review of Friday's incident. \n \n Katehi said the policies that campuses use to respond to encampments need to be changed as a result of the latest incidents. \n \n University officials must \"recognize that we are a campus of the 21st century, and students have different needs and different expectations of how to express themselves, and yet we have protocols of 30 or 40 years ago,\" she said. \"And we have a police force that has been trained for the incidents we dealt with 20 or 30 years ago.\" \n \n \u00a9 Copyright The Sacramento Bee.

The school will also drop charges against the 10 people arrested during the incident, the Los Angeles Times reports. Katehi said the school's police department defied her orders when it tried to clear out an Occupy encampment. \"We told the police to remove the tents or the equipment,\" she told the Sacramento Bee. \"We told them very specifically to do it peacefully, and if there were too many of them, not to do it, if the students were aggressive, not to do it. And then we told them we also do not want to have another Berkeley.\" Katehi said she still doesn't know who decided to use the pepper spray. \"It looked horrible, horrific, I would say, \" Katehi said. \"I can tell you that I woke up Saturday really early in the morning, like 3am, and I felt like it was a disaster on our hands.\" The university system has also created an advisory panel to look into the incident, University of California President Mark Yudof said. \"My intent is to provide the chancellor and the entire University of California community with an independent, unvarnished report about what happened at Davis,\" he said.",

    "document": "When Carla Harris left her boyfriend Sunday night, she said she told him not to drink. They needed to drive later that night to pick up their daughter and a friend at the Waterworks Mall. \n \n Pittsburgh police said Richard Benton, 53, of Wilkinsburg did not heed Ms. Harris' advice. When Ms. Harris, 52, of East Liberty returned home, she said Mr. Benton, who she did not realize had been drinking, volunteered to drive. \n \n They got in a black Ford Explorer to pick up Shamera Harris and drop off one of her friends at a home on Schenley Manor Drive in Stanton Heights. \n \n When they arrived at the friend's house, Ms. Harris said, Mr. Benton asked their daughter to get out of the car so he could take a picture because she looked beautiful. Mr. Benton fiddled with the gearshift and got out of the car, she said. \n \n The car \"just took off at full speed,\" dragging their 12-year-old daughter and slamming into a tree. \n \n \"I just panicked and I asked him, 'What did you do?' \" \n \n Ms. Harris said she tried to stop the car but could not. \n \n \"I ran to pull her out and gave her CPR and she was already gone. I tried. I prayed over her.\" \n \n Shamera died at the scene about 8:30 p.m. Sunday. When Pittsburgh police arrived, Mr. Benton smelled of alcohol, slurred his speech, was \"unsteady\" on his feet and had \"glassy and watery eyes,\" according to a criminal complaint. \n \n Mr. Benton, who was released Monday morning on nonmonetary bond, could not be reached for comment. \n \n Police wrote in the complaint that he refused a breath test and refused to comply with field sobriety tests. \n \n Police handcuffed Mr. Benton at the scene and took him to a station for further tests. He again refused tests, saying he wanted to contact an attorney, according to the complaint. \n \n After consulting with the Allegheny County district attorney's office, police charged Mr. Benton with driving under the influence and took him to UPMC Mercy for treatment of minor injuries before he went to the Allegheny County Jail. \n \n The Allegheny County medical examiner's office found during an autopsy that Shamera died of blunt force trauma and ruled her death an accident. The police investigation continues. \n \n Ms. Harris said she did not realize Mr. Benton had been drinking and that she would not have gotten in the car -- let alone permitted children to ride in it -- if she had suspected he was drunk. \n \n \"This is a horrible death. She didn't deserve that,\" Ms. Harris said. Friends and family visited Ms. Harris at her Highland Park home Monday to offer condolences. \n \n Shamera made the honor roll at Pittsburgh Dilworth PreK-5, her mother said. In her few months at Pittsburgh Obama 6-12, where she enjoyed swimming, she earned a reputation as a \"pleasant young lady, who always followed the rules in every one of her classrooms,\" according to a statement from the school district. \n \n The school was closed Monday due to a power outage. School support staff are expected to be available to talk to students today. \n \n Shamera enjoyed using the computer and making plans with friends on Facebook -- like the ones she made Sunday night to see a new Kevin Hart movie at the Waterworks Mall with a group of friends. \n \n \"She was just my gift from God,\" her mother said. \n \n Ms. Harris said she had been told that she would never have children, then at age 40, she had Shamera, her only child. \n \n She said Mr. Benton called her after he was released from jail Monday. \"I can't talk to him right now. I just can't. He has other children. I have none.\" ||||| By Megan Harris and Margaret Harding \n \n Carla Harris saw blood on her daughter's blue jacket before paramedics arrived, and she knew Shamera was dead. \n \n On Monday, no sunlight permeated the East Liberty home where family members and friends invited the Tribune-Review to talk about the life of Shamera Harris, 12, who died the night before when her father's Ford Explorer rolled backward, dragging the girl into a tree while her mother tried frantically to crawl into the driver's seat and put the SUV in park, she said. \n \n The girl's father, Richard Benton, 53, slurred his speech and smelled of alcohol at the scene of the crash on Schenley Manor Drive, according to the criminal complaint police filed when charging him with drunken driving. \n \n Carla Harris said Benton \u201cseemed normal\u201d when he dropped by late Sunday and offered to pick up Shamera and a friend from The Waterworks mall. \n \n \u201cIf I had known he was drinking, I never would've let him (drive),\u201d she said. \n \n On their way to the other child's home on Schenley Manor Drive, Benton pulled over to snap a picture. Benton was \u201cmessing around with the gear shifter\u201d just before Shamera stepped out of the car, police said Harris told them. \n \n Officials weren't sure how the SUV caught the girl or how quickly the car rolled back. Collision investigators will inspect the vehicle, Lt. Daniel Herrmann said. He called the incident a \u201cterrible accident.\u201d \n \n \u201cIf there's reason to believe (Benton) is responsible for this girl's death, then there will be charges,\u201d Herrmann said. \n \n Teachers at Pittsburgh Obama 6-12 School said through Pittsburgh Public Schools spokeswoman Ebony Pugh that Shamera was \u201ca quiet, pleasant young lady who always followed the rules in every one of her classrooms.\u201d The school was closed because of a power outage, but counselors will be available on Tuesday, Pugh said. \n \n Funeral arrangements through Cleft of the Rock Ministries were not finalized. \n \n Shamera is the second in her family to die suddenly, the family said. \n \n One relative, Jacquet Bazemore, 63, of Highland Park, pointed to a pair of fading photographs on top of the family's television. Shamera, age 8 or 9, grins in pastels beneath long, dark braids. Shakkeem Harris, then a toddler, laughs with his father, Shawn. Two years ago, officers found Shakkeem, at age 22, face-down and shot in Morningside's Joe Natoli Field. \n \n \u201cWe've endured so much tragedy,\u201d said Joyce Harris, their grandmother. \u201cNow both our babies are gone.\u201d \n \n It's hard to reconcile senseless mistakes, Shawn Harris said. \n \n Carla Harris, 51, a longtime crossing guard at Dilworth School in Highland Park, called Shamera her miracle baby and best friend. \n \n \u201cI wasn't supposed to have children, but God blessed me with her at 40. We did everything together,\u201d she said. \u201cShe walked to my post at 4:30 (p.m.) every day, her and all her girlfriends. Now I'll see them cross and not my baby girl.\u201d \n \n Officers said Benton refused field and chemical sobriety tests. He was released from Allegheny County Jail midday under conditions that he report to court at 10 a.m. Tuesday and participate in a substance-abuse treatment program. \n \n Court records indicate Benton, whom Harris said is a school bus driver, pleaded guilty to driving under the influence in Georgia in 1996 and to simple harassment in 2012. Allegheny County records don't indicate whom Benton harassed. \n \n Megan Harris and Margaret Harding are Trib Total Media staff writers. Reach Harris at 412-388-5815 or mharris@tribweb.com.

Every day, he would check out online news sites at the library or find a newspaper and read it front to back in the McDonald\u2019s by the park. \n \n It was his obsession with current events, along with his keen eye, that led him to spot the fugitives Saturday, hanging out down the block from a police station. As a result, Hay-Chapman is in line to collect $140,000 in reward money. \n \n \u201cWhen they told me about the benefits, that didn\u2019t matter,\u201d Chapman said Tuesday in front of the McDonald\u2019s at Haight and Stanyan streets, still proudly wearing the black hoodie that San Francisco police gave him as thanks for his assistance. \u201cI was just doing the right thing.\u201d \n \n Hay-Chapman had already escaped living in the park, having befriended a man who lets him sleep on his couch. Now he hopes to use the reward money not just to rebuild his own life, but also to help a troubled son, disabled daughter and two young grandchildren who are in foster care in Oregon. \n \n Life turmoil \n \n Hay-Chapman hasn\u2019t always been one wrong step from the streets. He was raised on military bases all over the world, one of 10 children of an Air Force colonel. Two of his eight brothers are in law enforcement. \n \n Before his life fell apart, Hay-Chapman worked as a carpenter, as a heating and air conditioning installer, as a vault locksmith and as a hotel night manager. Then came the back pain, brought on by lifting something in 2000. It got so bad he couldn\u2019t work. \n \n His daughter, now 33, suffered a brain hemorrhage at birth and is severely disabled. His 30-year-old son lost custody of his two children because of struggles with drug addiction. \n \n \u2018Ups and downs\u2019 \n \n His family said Hay-Chapman has trouble staying on a steady course, but did not have a drug or alcohol problem. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s had his ups and downs,\u201d said his brother John Hay-Chapman, \u201cHe is a jack of all trades \u2014 he is a good mechanic. ... But he can be irresponsible too, and his troubles came when he followed the wrong road.\u201d \n \n He added, \u201cBut here is the thing about Matt: He is sharp, he reads the paper and he is up on everything.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Photo: Paul Chinn, The Chronicle Image 1 of / 5 Caption Close Image 1 of 5 Matthew Hay-Chapman enters Golden Gate Park in front of the McDonald's restaurant at Haight and Stanyan streets in San Francisco, Calif. on Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016 near the location where two Orange County jail escapees were apprehended after he recognized the fugitives and pointed them out to police last Saturday. less Matthew Hay-Chapman enters Golden Gate Park in front of the McDonald's restaurant at Haight and Stanyan streets in San Francisco, Calif. on Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016 near the location where two Orange County jail ... more Photo: Paul Chinn, The Chronicle Image 2 of 5 Matthew Hay-Chapman returns to the McDonald's restaurant at Haight and Stanyan streets in San Francisco, Calif. on Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016 to describe how he spotted two of the Orange County jail escapees last Saturday and pointed them out to police, resulting in their capture. less Matthew Hay-Chapman returns to the McDonald's restaurant at Haight and Stanyan streets in San Francisco, Calif. on Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016 to describe how he spotted two of the Orange County jail escapees last ... more Photo: Paul Chinn, The Chronicle Image 3 of 5 Matthew Hay-Chapman crosses Stanyan Street in front of the McDonald's restaurant at Haight Street in San Francisco, Calif. on Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016 after describing how he recognized two of the Orange County jail escapees last Saturday and pointed them out to police, resulting in their capture. less Matthew Hay-Chapman crosses Stanyan Street in front of the McDonald's restaurant at Haight Street in San Francisco, Calif. on Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016 after describing how he recognized two of the Orange County ... more Photo: Paul Chinn, The Chronicle Image 4 of 5 Matthew Hay-Chapman returns to the McDonald's restaurant at Haight and Stanyan streets in San Francisco, Calif. on Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016 to describe how he spotted two of the Orange County jail escapees last Saturday and pointed them out to police, resulting in their capture. less Matthew Hay-Chapman returns to the McDonald's restaurant at Haight and Stanyan streets in San Francisco, Calif. on Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016 to describe how he spotted two of the Orange County jail escapees last ... more Photo: Paul Chinn, The Chronicle Image 5 of 5 Matthew Hay-Chapman returns to the McDonald's restaurant at Haight and Stanyan streets in San Francisco, Calif. on Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016 to describe how he spotted two of the Orange County jail escapees last Saturday and pointed them out to police, resulting in their capture. less Matthew Hay-Chapman returns to the McDonald's restaurant at Haight and Stanyan streets in San Francisco, Calif. on Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016 to describe how he spotted two of the Orange County jail escapees last ... more Photo: Paul Chinn, The Chronicle Hard-luck hero helped police nab dangerous escapees 1 / 5 Back to Gallery \n \n Matthew Hay-Chapman and his friend regularly go to the McDonald\u2019s at the entrance of the park \u2014 and it was there, on Saturday, that Hay-Chapman was at the right place at the right time. \n \n He was on his way into the fast-food restaurant when when he spotted a white 2008 GMC Savana van parked at the side of the Whole Foods Market on Haight. It looked like the one he used to drive when he worked as a mechanic \u2014 and then lived in when times got hard. \n \n Recognized van \n \n Because he\u2019s a news junkie and has what he calls a photographic memory, Hay-Chapman realized that the van matched one that had been linked to three men who had been on the run since they escaped from the Orange County jail Jan. 22. \n \n \u201cI noticed the windows were all steamed up \u2014 real heavy condensation,\u201d Hay-Chapman said. He figured someone was living inside. \n \n Suddenly, \u201cboom, this guy pops out of the van. I had seen him in the news,\u201d Hay-Chapman said. \u201cI said, \u2018That\u2019s the guy \u2014 that\u2019s the Iranian escapee!\u2019\u201d \n \n He followed the man, 37-year-old Hossein Nayeri, into the McDonald\u2019s. Nayeri got in a line that was six people deep, while Hay-Chapman sat down at a table. \n \n Photo: Associated Press This undated photo provided by the Orange County Sheriff's... \n \n \u201cI knew I had time,\u201d Hay-Chapman said. \u201cI studied the man ... because I wanted to be 100 percent sure before I go and alert the authorities.\u201d \n \n Once he was sure, he slipped outside. After a passerby refused to let him use a cell phone, he headed for the nearby Park police station. \n \n Before he got there, a patrol car with two officers in it happened by. Hay-Chapman flagged them down with his metal cane. \n \n The officers were about to confront Nayeri when a man on the street suddenly collapsed into the arms of one of them. As the police called for paramedics, Hay-Chapman kept watch for Nayeri, who soon emerged from McDonald\u2019s with a cup of coffee. \n \n \u2018Last taste of freedom\u2019 \n \n \u201cI call it his last taste of freedom,\u201d Hay-Chapman said. \u201cMcDonald\u2019s coffee is worth a lot, and he paid for it.\u201d \n \n With the officers preoccupied with the man who had collapsed, Nayeri \u201cwalked calmly past me, calmly with his coffee,\u201d Hay-Chapman said. He watched as the fugitive walked down the restaurant\u2019s steps and crouched between two parked vehicles. \n \n \u201cNow he pops up and he starts to walk calmly across Stanyan,\u201d Hay-Chapman said. After a few feet, \u201che bolts and he runs into the park. Man, the guy was running right toward the police station.\u201d \n \n The officers fanned out and eventually caught up with Nayeri in front of the station. When they returned to the van, a second fugitive, 20-year-old Jonathan Tieu, was still in it. \n \n Photo: Associated Press This undated booking photo provided by the Orange County, Calif.,... \n \n Nayeri, who had been held on aggravated mayhem, kidnapping and torture charges, and Tieu, who was facing gang-related murder and attempted-murder charges, were returned to authorities in Orange County. The third fugitive, Bac Duong, 43, had turned himself in Friday in Santa Ana. \n \n \u201cWould that every citizen would be paying that much attention,\u201d said Police Chief Greg Suhr, who confirmed Hay-Chapman\u2019s pivotal role in the capture. \u201cGod bless him for having courage and for being that observant and that sharp. \n \n \u201cIt is pretty amazing,\u201d Suhr said of Hay-Chapman\u2019s story. \u201cHe makes the neighborhood safer.\u201d \n \n Orange County sheriff\u2019s officials say they will work with agencies that offered separate rewards \u2014 including the county Board of Supervisors, U.S. Marshals Service and the FBI \u2014 to deliver the money where it belongs. \n \n Hay-Chapman figures it\u2019s his time. \n \n \u201cWhen I was down and out, nobody wanted to help me out,\u201d he said. He hopes that because he was \u201cbrave enough to stand up\u201d on Saturday, the money will lead to a better life for him and his family. \n \n Friend\u2019s point of view \n \n The friend who finally did help him said Hay-Chapman deserves every penny coming to him. \n \n \u201cHe is really a straight-up guy,\u201d said the friend, who asked that his name not be used. \u201cHe is a guy who is into doing good things for people even though he is homeless. \n \n \u201cHe did what he was supposed to do, what people are asked to do. That money would help him straighten his life out.\u201d \n \n Jaxon Van Derbeken is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. E-mail: jvanderbeken@sfchronicle.com",

Matthew Hay-Chapman recognized the inmates' stolen van in a Whole Foods parking lot on Jan. 28 and spotted fugitive Hossein Nayeri emerging from the vehicle. He says he found a police officer and led him to the van, leading to the capture of Nayeri and fellow escapee Jonathan Tieu. A third man had surrendered a day earlier.

    "document": "Damascus - Did [Syrian Vice-President] Farouk al-Sharaa defect? No, he is under house arrest. No, he is now under the protection of armed opposition groups. He arrived to Jordan accompanied by dozens of officers. In fact, he is on his way to Paris where a senior official is waiting for him. \n \n These, and many more, are the rumors that were often repeated and shared on internet sites by opponents of the Syrian regime. \n \n Farouk al-Sharaa is outside the decision-making circles. He has been cut off from important discussions. The Syrian leadership is not speaking to him. He has been isolated and relieved of his duties as vice-president, without a job since the funeral of the high-ranking officers in the explosion at the State Security building. \n \n But the truth is neither this or that. Syrian Vice-President Farouk al-Sharaa is at the heart of the action, but not in the decision-making circles. These, and others, are the inside stories brought back to the Syrian capital by visitors who support the Syrian regime. \n \n But the truth is neither this or that. Syrian Vice-President Farouk al-Sharaa is at the heart of the action, but not in the decision-making circles. He keeps in touch with a few officials, speaks to President [Bashar al-Assad] from time to time, and communicates with some of the leadership. \n \n His residence is under the same security precautions as those of figures in the decision-making circles, and so are his movements. But he is full of energy and also keeps communication channels open with members of the opposition and figures who are not connected to the state or the regime. \n \n Sharaa has his own views on the daily events, including criticisms and apprehensions, which he kept expressing in official meetings, but without going public in the media. \n \n Something has changed, however. \n \n Sharaa is not pessimistic, but his heart is heavy with concern about the country and he describes the situation as it is. He does not feel compelled to be involved in every detail, especially when he cannot change the suggested solutions. He cannot remain silent about the mistakes and issues that are threatening the future of the country. As a veteran of the regime, he does not need anyone to tell him when and how to get involved. \n \n A Barricaded City \n \n The road to Damascus is not as it was six months ago, or a year ago, or a year and a half ago. The crisis gripping Syria has left its mark on everything. The military and security checkpoints with the cement barricades, a scene quite familiar to the Lebanese, are present. \n \n Upon a closer look, one discovers that they are forming a spiral queue around a bakery, to buy unaffordable bread. \n \n The unusual sight of scores of citizens surrounding a building grabs your attention. Upon closer look, one discovers that they are forming a spiral queue around a bakery, to buy unaffordable bread. \n \n Farouk al-Sharaa sits in his home, which was reached by passing through several military checkpoints. He gives an account of the Syrian landscape since the first day of the crisis. \n \n He speaks about the regime and the party and state leadership. He describes what is happening on the ground and the roles played by foreign powers against Syria and its historical role in the region. \n \n But none of this seems to distract him, not even for one moment, from a sense of responsibility to play a role and propose a way out for Syria from the deepening crisis. \n \n He is a friend of the Russian people, which are loyal to their historical relationship with the Syrians. He fondly describes his memories of China, the great country that developed itself surely and calmly, to become one of the strongest forces on Earth. \n \n As for Iran, he believes it is the closest power to Syria, and not just the regime. Following its revolution, he believes that Iran was on its way becoming a great democratic experiment, were it not for the [Iran-Iraq] war imposed on it. \n \n He acknowledges that it took the right position on the central Arab cause, Palestine, and supported the resistance in Lebanon, which rightfully expunged Israel from South Lebanon in the year 2000 and deterred its aggression in July 2006. \n \n Sharaa has trusted the wisdom of Iran\u2019s spiritual leader Ali Khamenei, even since his time as president of Iran, and lauds [Hezbollah leader] Hassan Nasrallah\u2019s resilience. He is convinced that they could have played a bigger role in reaching an early political solution to the Syrian crisis. \n \n Sharaa follows all the events in the Arab world. In his opinion, Egypt witnessed a seismic shift and there is no turning back. But the political and media mobilization should continue and not ignore what continues to take place in that country. \n \n Sharaa informed all those who contact him that he will not accept and does not aspire to head any transitional government. According to Sharaa, Egypt is a country that transcends history and the relationship with it should be solid and healthy. It can do a lot for Arabs. Its situation today should be closely monitored, because it will not immediately achieve the conclusive results hoped for by the Egyptians. \n \n What pains him most is that Syria did not have a chance to capitalize on the US failure in Iraq and the troubled withdrawal of Western forces from Afghanistan. He sees that other countries in the region, such as Iran, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia were able to benefit from the US pullout, while Syria sunk into a major ongoing crisis. \n \n Farouk al-Sharaa, a veteran Baathist and diplomat who hails from the Houran plains, is one Syrian official who is known for his integrity and wisdom. He has his views on everything and lived through an intense experience with the late Syrian President Hafez al-Assad. \n \n He stood by Bashar al-Assad from the very first moment, seeing in him a chance for change and moving Syria somewhere more advanced. But since the beginning of the crisis in 2011, he felt that the odds are not in his favor. \n \n Sharaa informed all those who contact him that he will not accept and does not aspire to head any transitional government. He is only worried about Syria. He says what he needs to say in support of certain steps, in criticism of a decision or a behavior, or in objection to a certain orientation or action. \n \n Sharaa is one of the Syrian officials who seems most aware of the magnitude of the changes in the Arab world. He is also one of the most capable of conducting self-criticism of the Baath party and its role or of the regime, its mechanisms, and institutions. \n \n Sharaa does not act outside his mandate, go over the president\u2019s head, or play behind his back. He mocks the media for the talk about his defection. Sharaa had been absent from the media for a long time. Now he returns to say words with meanings. He is an official who wants to see something new, but keeps his respect for the work of the state. \n \n Sharaa does not act outside his mandate, go over the president\u2019s head, or play behind his back. He mocks the media for the talk about his defection. \n \n The Militarization of the Protests \n \n Sharaa differentiates between two opposition mobilizations. He has a clear view of the situation in his country, since the first days of the crisis. \n \n At the beginning of the mobilization, the authorities begged for the appearance of a single armed person or a sniper at the top of one of the buildings. Today, every single authority in Syria is complaining \u2013 even to the UN Security Council \u2013 about the spread of armed groups, which are impossible to count or monitor. \n \n There are cities and cities\u2019 peripheries which have been completely \u201ccleansed\u201d and their inhabitants displaced. The fighters were able to return several times, but the residents couldn\u2019t. \n \n \u201cDoes anyone have the right to shove the country into a bottleneck which cannot be escaped without breaking the glass?\u201d Sharaa wonders bitterly whenever he sees images of the bodies of innocent citizens and the disfigurement caused by the shelling, explosions, and car bombs, which target people, infrastructure, public and private utilities, and scientific minds in the country. \n \n \u201cThose who commit these crimes and those who support them are guilty and have lost all sense of patriotism, morality, and humanity,\u201d he says. \n \n There were many mistakes made by the Arab League and the [Syrian] state both, which cannot be forgotten or stepped over. \u201cThe drop in the number of peaceful protesters led one way or another to the rise in militants,\u201d Sharaa maintains. \u201cWhile it is the duty of the state to provide its citizens with security, this is different than deciding on a military solution to the crisis. The two issues should not be mixed.\u201d \n \n \u201cAll of this should have required a discussion of mechanisms and an attempt at a Syrian-Syrian solution. The dialogue we adopted in July 2011 aimed at solving the crisis politically from the start, by Syrian hands,\u201d he adds. \n \n \u201cBut things did not go in this direction,\u201d Sharaa explains. \u201cThe crisis was Arabized. Syria, a founding member of the League of Arab States, saw its membership suspended from the league without justification or a pretext that could convince Syrian citizens.\u201d \n \n \u201cThere were many mistakes made by the Arab League and the [Syrian] state both, which cannot be forgotten or stepped over,\u201d he surmises. \n \n But where is the responsibility of the Syrian state in investigating the causes for the crisis reaching this level, especially in the militarization of the protests? Weren\u2019t there commissions of inquiry set up for this? \n \n We must be in the position of defending Syria\u2019s existence. We are not in a battle for the survival of an individual or a regime. \u201cNo credible commission of inquiry was set up at the beginning of the crisis. If some were set up, the results were not made public, allowing for the spread of rumors that lost the regime its credibility and stature in the eyes of those who were wronged internally and outside observers,\u201d he explains. \n \n The Country\u2019s Survival, Not Ours \n \n The Syrian vice-president acknowledges that the crisis is deep. \u201cWith every passing day, the solution gets further away, militarily and politically,\u201d he warns. \u201cWe must be in the position of defending Syria\u2019s existence. We are not in a battle for the survival of an individual or a regime.\u201d \n \n Sharaa believes that Syria\u2019s problems \u201chave multiplied and are complicated to an extent where ongoing military operations cannot be kept away from the normal life of citizens.\u201d \n \n Are We In a Process of Resolution? \n \n According to Sharaa, \u201cseveral issues must be tackled in order to reach a solution. Nobody has the illusion that things will return to what they used to be, because you cannot turn back the clock.\u201d \n \n \u201c[UN peace envoy] Lakhdar Brahimi keeps repeating in his statements that things are going from bad to worse. I cannot deny this but, for over a year, I have been seeing the line that links the events. The way events are heading will lead to an uncomfortable place where things will definitely go from bad to worse.,\u201d he remarks. \u201cBut the problem is that Mister Brahimi is slow and careful, while events on the ground are accelerating and becoming more violent.\u201d \n \n \u201cFrom my perspective, I am not completely certain where the current option will take us. I do not have a transparent answer. Officials might not even know where we have reached in the solution,\u201d he explains. \u201cYou might be surprised if I tell you that even the president himself might not be able to provide you with a satisfactory answer, although he has all the power in the country in his hands.\u201d \n \n \u201cWhat is happening in Syria is complicated, elaborate, and intricate. If you try to unravel it, it might get more complex and the hidden stitches could multiply, instead of guiding you to a solution,\u201d he elucidates. \n \n The solution will not be realistic unless it was initiated at the highest levels. \u201cIf anyone has the chance to meet Mister President, he would hear from him that this is a long struggle, a big conspiracy with many actors (terrorists, rabble, smugglers). He does not hide his desire for a military solution that achieves a decisive victory, and only then would the political dialogue be actually possible. Many in the [Baath] party, the [National Progressive] Front (NPF), and the military forces have been convinced from the onset of the crisis that there is no alternative to a political solution and that there is no turning back,\u201d he adds. \n \n Sharaa believes that \u201cthe solution will not be realistic unless it was initiated at the highest levels. The president of the republic is also the general commander of the armed forces. He appoints the prime minister, leads the ruling party, and chooses the head of the people\u2019s assembly.\u201d \n \n \u201cBut, at the same time, there are the executive, legislative, and judiciary institutions, which are directly responsible for running the country\u2019s affairs,\u201d he informs. \u201cThese institutions have heads, general directors, and governing boards, who work, some who claim to work, according to the directions. Sometimes they make up their minds by pointing to the picture above their desks, meaning that the directive is not up for discussion.\u201d \n \n No Change Without Partners \n \n \u201cIn 1970, many state institutions were built on top of the inconsistencies and conflicts of the revolutionary command council back then, based on an agreed upon pact (for example, the NPF, the people\u2019s assembly, and local administrations). These institutions started to deteriorate and were not renewed, despite multiple attempts to restructure them since president Bashar al-Assad assumed leadership in the year 2000,\u201d Sharaa explains. \n \n \u201cThese institutions then started to function based on their own inertia. This could be partially acceptable in times of stability and decades of security. But how could it happen during major crises and the resulting destruction of infrastructure and homes, the lack of electricity, the stoppage of hospitals in many cities and towns, and the escalating internal and external displacement?\u201d he asks. \u201cThis is not to mention the detention of thousands of people who are not presented in front of the courts, as if we are still under martial law.\u201d \n \n \u201cNeither the [Syrian] National Coalition, nor the Istanbul Council, nor the National Coordination Body as a multi-polar internal opposition, nor any opposition faction be it civilian or armed with their external ties, can claim to be the sole legitimate representative of the Syrian People, just as the current rule with its ideological army and its confrontation parties lead by the Baath, with its years of experience and rooted bureaucracy, cannot achieve change and progress alone without new partners who can contribute to maintaining the fabric of the homeland, the integrity of its territory, and its regional sovereignty. The loss of trust between these two sides, and therefore the impossibility of getting together for a direct dialogue, will lead to continuous destruction and dismantling, which will only benefit the Israeli occupation at this stage,\u201d he declares confidently. \n \n Sharaa believes that \u201cthe political, economic, and social structure of the country is changing day by day and in front of our eyes. What is happening in Syria is homologous with what happened in the early 1990s in the countries of Eastern Europe. We should also note that those countries did not enter into civil clashes or destructive wars, during the transformation in their structure of their regimes, although they faced suffocating economic crises.\u201d \n \n Leadership Discussions \n \n Does the leadership have one opinion or are they just obeying the orders? Does the president listen, for example, to opinions that differ from his diagnosis? \n \n \u201cOf course, there are opinions and viewpoints among the political leadership. But the issue is not in a place that could lead to talk about different currents or deep divisions,\u201d Sharaa replies. \n \n \u201cWhen I took care of the dialogue dossier, as vice president, in July 2011, I agreed to this appointment based on my convictions and everyone else\u2019s in the national dialogue commission that this was a real step and not just a tactical move.\u201d \n \n \u201cI do not deny that some of us acted as if [the dialogue] was unnecessary and whispered this to the leadership. So it distanced itself under the pretext that the internal and external opposition saw it as one of the regime\u2019s charades. In the end, this finished off the political dialogue and opened the doors wide for the dialogue of bullets and guns. Today, Syria witnesses a sharp economic and livelihood crisis, in addition to the political and military conflict.\u201d \n \n Does anyone have the illusion that this people will accept foreign armies on Syrian soil? This will never happen and it will be resisted. \u201cWhen we say that we refuse any external intervention, we base this on the fact that there was no consensus from the people to involve our national army in the crisis to begin with. So does anyone have the illusion that this people will accept foreign armies on Syrian soil? This will never happen and it will be resisted. The preeminence and unity of the Syrian army are indispensable in any of the proposed political solutions and discussions.\u201d \n \n But is the crisis only connected to political considerations? \n \n \u201cIn any evaluation, we cannot ignore the local components linked with the economic situation and the policies implemented in the recent years at least. We also cannot ignore the actual need for a meaningful change in all of the state apparatus and its institutions. Real change is one which is based on solving the pressing issues based on requisite priorities. Maybe in the past we did not listen very carefully or take into consideration comments about the need for quick change. But we learn from our experience and that of others. Today, we understand that change is inevitable. If the regime does not take the initiative to achieve it with the others, it will happen through unilateral dictates from them.\u201d \n \n A Syrian Solution \n \n How do you perceive the solution? \n \n \u201cAny logic based on the premise of rejecting dialogue indicates the desire for Syrians not to reach a solution on their own. Therefore, any settlement, whether starting with talks or agreements between Arab, regional, or foreign capitals, cannot exist without a solid Syrian foundation. The solution has to be Syrian, but through a historic settlement, which would include the main regional countries, and the members of UN Security Council. This settlement must include stopping all shapes of violence, and the creation of a national unity government with wide powers. This should be accompanied by the resolution of sensitive dossiers related to the lives of people and their legitimate demands.\u201d \n \n I do not see that what the security forces and the army units are doing will not reach a conclusive end. \u201cThe problem gets bigger and deeper when some start thinking that victory and defeat are possible. The opposition forces combined cannot decide the battle of overthrowing the regime militarily, unless they aim to pull the country into chaos and an unending circle of violence. Meanwhile, I do not see that what the security forces and the army units are doing will not reach a conclusive end, especially since we understand, without any illusions, the threat of the current campaign to destroy Syria, its history, civilization, and people. Brahimi\u2019s contacts and visits, as well as the Geneva initiative, can be considered a suitable foundation for this settlement. I am not exaggerating when I say that reaching a historic settlement for the Syrian crisis might pave the way for an international environment of solving other important issues, through political means and not through military confrontation.\u201d \n \n But is the historical settlement ripe? \n \n Sharaa hopes so, but is quick to add that \u201cif each side involved in the settlement thinks that they can get all they expect and aspire to, then the legitimate national outlook of the Syrian people will be lost and the region\u2019s fate will enter a dark tunnel.\u201d ||||| BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syrian rebels took full control of the Yarmouk Palestinian refugee camp on Monday after fighting raged for days in the district on the southern edge of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s Damascus powerbase, rebel and Palestinian sources said. \n \n The battle had pitted rebels, backed by some Palestinians, against Palestinian fighters of the pro-Assad Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC). Many PFLP-GC fighters defected to the rebel side and their leader Ahmed Jibril left the camp two days ago, rebel sources said. \n \n \u201cAll of the camp is under the control of the (rebel) Free Syrian Army,\u201d said a Palestinian activist in Yarmouk. He said clashes had stopped and the remaining PFLP fighters retreated to join Assad\u2019s forces massed on the northern edge of the camp. \n \n The battle in Yarmouk is one of a series of conflicts on the southern fringes of Assad\u2019s capital, as rebels try to choke the power of the 47-year-old leader after a 21-month-old uprising in which 40,000 people have been killed. \n \n Government forces have used jets and artillery to try to dislodge the fighters but the violence has crept into the heart of the city and activists say rebels overran three army stations in a new offensive in the central province of Hama on Monday. \n \n On the border with Lebanon, hundreds of Palestinian families fled across the frontier following the weekend violence in Yarmouk, a Reuters witness said. \n \n Syria hosts half a million Palestinian refugees, most living in Yarmouk, descendants of those admitted after the creation of Israel in 1948, and has always cast itself as a champion of the Palestinian struggle, sponsoring several guerrilla factions. \n \n Both Assad\u2019s government and the mainly Sunni Muslim Syrian rebels have enlisted and armed divided Palestinian factions as the uprising has developed into a civil war. \n \n \u201cNEITHER SIDE CAN WIN\u201d \n \n Syrian Vice President Farouq al-Sharaa said in a newspaper interview published on Monday that neither Assad\u2019s forces nor rebels seeking to overthrow him can win the war. \n \n Sharaa, a Sunni Muslim in a power structure dominated by Assad\u2019s Alawite minority, has rarely been seen since the revolt erupted in March 2011 and is not part of the president\u2019s inner circle directing the fight against Sunni rebels. But he is the most prominent figure to say in public that Assad will not win. \n \n Sharaa said the situation in Syria was deteriorating and a \u201chistoric settlement\u201d was needed to end the conflict, involving regional powers and the U.N. Security Council and the formation of a national unity government \u201cwith broad powers\u201d. \n \n A torn poster of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad is seen at the entrance of a factory in Ouwayjah village in Aleppo December 17, 2012. REUTERS/Zain Karam \n \n \u201cWith every passing day the political and military solutions are becoming more distant. We should be in a position defending the existence of Syria. We are not in a battle for an individual or a regime,\u201d Sharaa was quoted as telling Al-Akhbar newspaper. \n \n \u201cThe opposition cannot decisively settle the battle and what the security forces and army units are doing will not achieve a decisive settlement,\u201d he said, adding that insurgents fighting to topple Syria\u2019s leadership could plunge it into \u201canarchy and an unending spiral of violence\u201d. \n \n Sources close to the Syrian government say Sharaa had pushed for dialogue with the opposition and objected to the military response to an uprising that began peacefully. \n \n In a veiled criticism of the crackdown, he said there was a difference between the state\u2019s duty to provide security to its citizens, and \u201cpursuing a security solution to the crisis\u201d. \n \n He said even Assad could not be certain where events in Syria were leading, but that anyone who met him would hear that \u201cthis is a long struggle...and he does not hide his desire to settle matters militarily to reach a final solution.\u201d \n \n In Hama province, rebels and the army clashed in a new campaign launched on Sunday by rebels to block off the country\u2019s north, activists said. \n \n The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition-linked violence monitor, said fighting raged through the provincial towns of Karnaz, Kafar Weeta, Halfayeh and Mahardeh. \n \n Slideshow (23 Images) \n \n It said there were no clashes reported in Hama city, which lies on the main north-south highway connecting the capital with Aleppo, Syria\u2019s second city. \n \n Qassem Saadeddine, a member of the newly established rebel military command, said on Sunday fighters had been ordered to surround and attack army positions across the province. He said Assad\u2019s forces were given 48 hours to surrender or be killed. \n \n In 1982 Hafez al-Assad, father of the current ruler, crushed an uprising in Hama city, killing up to 30,000 civilians. \n \n Qatiba al-Naasan, a rebel from Hama, said the offensive would bring retaliatory air strikes from the government but that the situation is \u201calready getting miserable\u201d.",

But neither side will see a victory, says Farouk al-Sharaa, who has kept a low profile in the conflict and isn't involved in running the government's efforts. Sharaa's comments came in an interview with a pro-Assad newspaper, al-Akhbar. He says the only solution is a \"historic settlement\" forming a national unity government, with help from neighboring countries and the UN. \"Change is inevitable.\" \"We should be in a position defending the existence of Syria. We are not in a battle for an individual or a regime,\" Sharaa said. Government insiders say he has long opposed the government's military action.

Following its revolution, he believes that Iran was on its way becoming a great democratic experiment, were it not for the [Iran-Iraq] war imposed on it.

He responded when they called with requests to speak at their college, contribute to a symposium, or stand with any oppressed minority. He hated to say no to anything worthwhile, and cared less about getting paid than anyone I've ever known. After doing unaccountable favors for unimportant people, he named them comrades, which meant welcoming them into his circle of solidarity and acting as if they belonged in his home, with cocktails.

He had indeed felt something like this, although I cannot say I always felt it was for good reasons. Christopher, from the time that I knew him at Oxford, was always a brilliant speaker and debater, and in conversation incomparably interesting and engaging.

It was just the two of us. And one phone line. We were both working at The Nation. He had come to it as part of an exchange program with the New Statesman, a British publication, and had elected to remain in the wonderful and wild New York City of the late disco era. I was an editorial grunt. The magazine was running short on workspace, and we were assigned a small, windowless office on a floor apart from the main offices.

He wasn\u2019t sloppy about it. In fact, he always seemed in perfect control (I once saw him steer a beach bike through the streets of Key West without spilling his Scotch.) He just liked to keep the machine well-oiled so he could get on to more important things, like liberating oppressed peoples of the world, knocking out his 10,000 words a day, or starting fights with God, assuming there is one, which he doesn\u2019t.

He was not someone like Orwell (a comparison he himself nurtured and invited). He was Christopher Hitchens, unique and unduplicable. He was the most distinctive personality in Western literary journalism. If he was like anything, he resembled some larger-than-life 19th-century figura. He was journalism\u2019s Lord Byron. And unlike certain other Washington-based literati, he didn\u2019t spend his professional life hurling thunderbolts from behind the shelter of a title and a desk. He made his own way.

Read Slate\u2019s complete collection of Christopher Hitchens' columns. \n \n \n \n Here is how I came to hate Christopher Hitchens. Hate\u2014as in envy. \n \n In the early 1980s, as a twentysomething trying to start a career as a crusading journalist, I was fortunate enough to share an office with Hitchens. It was just the two of us. And one phone line. We were both working at The Nation. He had come to it as part of an exchange program with the New Statesman, a British publication, and had elected to remain in the wonderful and wild New York City of the late disco era. I was an editorial grunt. The magazine was running short on workspace, and we were assigned a small, windowless office on a floor apart from the main offices. These were the days before voice mail\u2014and much else\u2014and we would take phone messages for each other on pink slips of paper from \u201cwhile you were out\u201d notepads. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n You can learn a lot about a person by sharing an office\u2014and taking phone messages for him. \n \n This is how the average day proceeded: I\u2019d arrive in the morning around 9-ish. The phone would soon start ringing\u2014with calls for Hitchens. I\u2019d tell the callers he was not yet available, and they would leave messages: \u201cTell him, that was a wonderful dinner last night.\u201d Or, \u201cMick was so pleased to meet him.\u201d Or, \u201cWe may all get together again this evening.\u201d Within an hour or so, the nature of the messages would shift to cover plans for lunch that day: \u201cTell Christopher we\u2019re all meeting at the Spanish place.\u201d \n \n About this time, Hitchens would saunter in. He\u2019d say hello, turn to the pink slips I had placed on his desk, and return the calls. Did I say this was a small office? We each could hear everything the other said on the phone. He\u2019d first phone his compatriots from the previous evening and review what had transpired. He then would talk to his lunch-mates for the day and arrange the details. Then it would be time \u2026 to leave for lunch. \n \n While he was gone, calls would come in for him with invitations for afternoon drinks. (In those days, youngsters, late-afternoon drinks were practically obligatory in certain journalistic circles. Think of it as Manhattan teatime.) After a, shall we say, longish lunch, Hitchens would stop back in the office and return the calls regarding the pending drinks. Then it was, ta-ta, once again. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n By now you are getting the picture. But I\u2019m not done yet. After afternoon drinks, the general practice was to return to the office. Upon his arrival, Hitchens would sort through the latest pink slips with phone numbers from his friends, colleagues, and adversaries who had called about dinner plans and after-dinner drinks. (Yes, in those days, after-dinner drinks were a separate stop.) \n \n Soon, it was time for Hitchens to head out to the dinner engagement. He would start packing up. About now, Elizabeth Pochoda, the literary editor of the magazine, would poke her head in the door. \u201cChristopher, you\u2019re going to have that review of the Disraeli biography for me tomorrow, right?\u201d\u2014a soft touch of menace in her voice. \n \n \u201cOh, yes, of course.\u201d And as soon as she had departed, he\u2019d open his desk, rummage through a drawer, and pull out an 800-page biography of the British prime minister. It was clear to me that the book had yet to be opened. He\u2019d tuck the volume into his bag and say goodnight. \n \n By this point in the day, I knew all his plans for the evening, including the 11-ish rendezvous for cocktails. I wondered how he would be able to read this book and write a review by the next morning. But come the following day\u2014after the calls about the previous night and the calls about the lunch to come had started\u2014he\u2019d trundle into the office, Pochoda would show up, and he\u2019d hand her a 1,500-word essay. And it was\u2014you know the punch line\u2014brilliant. Did I mention this was in the days before computers? Next, it was off to lunch. \n \n I did learn much from Hitchens, but never how to function in quite this manner. What allowed him to live such a packed life was a trait that any of us would relish: He never forgot what he had ever read or learned. His mind was always expanding. That was a natural gift that few of us possess. He could not teach it. But observing Hitchens practice his craft and thrust and parry with intellectuals almost as sharp as him was as valuable an experience as I could have imagined. It sure beat attending J-school. And I much appreciated his sense of social egalitarianism. I found that few journalists of his stature paid much serious attention to the young wannabes nearby. I recall one particular moment, at some social/literary event, when I heard him utter what at the time seemed to be these improbable words, \u201cCarly, you do know David Corn, don\u2019t you?\u201d (It was that Carly.) She, of course, didn\u2019t. Hitchens, as a journalist and as a colleague, was inspiring. \n \n In later years, Hitchens and I had our differences. I was not heartened when he provided left-of-center and intellectual cover to the impeachment crusade waged by extremist radicals of the right in the 1990s. And we had words over his support for the Iraq War\u2014including within the pixels of Slate. I wish I could forget the time, a few months into the war, when he assured me, \u201cWolfowitz has the rats on the run and this will all be over soon.\u201d \n \n Yet policy and political debates, as important as they are, come and go. Examples remain. Hitchens set one for me. And I know there is no reason to ask him to rest in peace.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 There is no shortage of reflections on the life of Christopher Hitchens today, filled with memories and anecdotes that all seem to include the word \"cocktail.\" Writing for Slate, David Corn recounts his \"Hitchens tale,\" one that occurred some three decades ago while the two shared a tiny, windowless office at The Nation. It seems that Corn spent most of his day taking phone messages for Hitchens. In the morning, they'd be along the lines of \"'Tell him, that was a wonderful dinner last night.' Or, 'Mick was so pleased to meet him.'\" Then they'd shift to invitations for lunch, afternoon drinks, dinner, and an 11pm cocktail date, with Hitchens popping in just long enough to get those messages, then depart for said restaurant or watering hole. At some point, an editor would stop by to double-check that Hitchens would have, say, the review of a biography ready for her tomorrow. He'd say yes, then slip an 800-page book that clearly \"had yet to be opened ... into his bag and say goodnight.\" What he somehow turned in the next day was\u2014\"you know the punch line\u2014brilliant. Next, it was off to lunch.\" Corn writes that he learned many lessons from Hitchens, but \"never how to function in quite this manner. What allowed him to live such a packed life was a trait that any of us would relish: He never forgot what he had ever read or learned.\" It's not a skill that could be taught, but watching Hitchens \"practice his craft and thrust and parry with intellectuals almost as sharp as him was as valuable an experience as I could have imagined.\"",

    "document": "Hiroo Onoda, an Imperial Japanese Army officer who remained at his jungle post on an island in the Philippines for 29 years, refusing to believe that World War II was over, and returned to a hero\u2019s welcome in the all but unrecognizable Japan of 1974, died on Thursday in Tokyo. He was 91. \n \n His death, at a hospital there, was announced by the Japanese government. \n \n Caught in a time warp, Mr. Onoda, a second lieutenant, was one of the war\u2019s last holdouts: a soldier who believed that the emperor was a deity and the war a sacred mission; who survived on bananas and coconuts and sometimes killed villagers he assumed were enemies; who finally went home to the lotus land of paper and wood which turned out to be a futuristic world of skyscrapers, television, jet planes and pollution and atomic destruction. \n \n Japanese history and literature are replete with heroes who have remained loyal to a cause, especially if it is lost or hopeless, and Lieutenant Onoda, a small, wiry man of dignified manner and military bearing, seemed to many like a samurai of old, ultimately offering his sword as a gesture of surrender to President Ferdinand E. Marcos of the Philippines, who returned it to him. \n \n And his homecoming, with roaring crowds, celebratory parades and speeches by public officials, stirred his nation with a pride that many Japanese had found lacking in the postwar years of rising prosperity and materialism. His ordeal of deprivation may have seemed a pointless waste to much of the world, but in Japan it was a moving reminder of the redemptive qualities of duty and perseverance. \n \n It happened with a simple command. As he related in a memoir after he went home, Lieutenant Onoda\u2019s last order in early 1945 was to stay and fight. Loyal to a military code that taught that death was preferable to surrender, he remained behind on Lubang Island, 93 miles southwest of Manila, when Japanese forces withdrew in the face of an American invasion. \n \n After Japan surrendered, that September, thousands of Japanese soldiers were scattered across China, Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. Many stragglers were captured or went home, while hundreds went into hiding rather than surrender or commit suicide. Many died of starvation or sickness. A few survivors refused to believe the dropped leaflets and radio announcements saying the war had been lost. \n \n Lieutenant Onoda, an intelligence officer trained in guerrilla tactics, and three enlisted men with him found leaflets proclaiming the war\u2019s end, but believed they were enemy propaganda. They built bamboo huts, pilfered rice and other food from a village and killed cows for meat; they were tormented by tropical heat, rats and mosquitoes, and they patched their uniforms and kept their rifles in working order. \n \n Considering themselves to be at war, they evaded American and Filipino search parties and attacked islanders they took to be enemy guerrillas; about 30 inhabitants were killed in skirmishes with the Japanese over the years. One of the enlisted men surrendered to Filipino forces in 1950, and two others were shot dead, one in 1954 and another in 1972, by island police officers searching for the renegades. \n \n The last holdout, Lieutenant Onoda, officially declared dead in 1959, was found by Norio Suzuki, a student searching for him, in 1974. The lieutenant rejected Mr. Suzuki\u2019s pleas to go home, insisting he was still awaiting orders. Mr. Suzuki returned with photographs, and the Japanese government sent a delegation, including the lieutenant\u2019s brother and his former commander, to relieve him of duty formally. \n \n \u201cI am sorry I have disturbed you for so long a time,\u201d Lieutenant Onoda told his brother, Toshiro. \n \n In Manila, the lieutenant, wearing his tattered uniform, presented his sword to President Marcos, who pardoned him for crimes committed while he thought he was at war. \n \n He was already a national hero when he arrived in Tokyo, met by his aging parents and huge flag-waving crowds. More than patriotism or admiration for his grit, his jungle saga, which had dominated the news in Japan for days, evoked waves of nostalgia and melancholy. The 52-year-old soldier \u2014 a ghost from the past in a new blue suit, close-cropped military haircut and wispy mustache and chin whiskers \u2014 spoke earnestly of duty, and seemed to personify a devotion to traditional values that many Japanese thought had been lost. \n \n \u201cI was fortunate that I could devote myself to my duty in my young and vigorous years,\u201d he said. Asked what had been on his mind all that time in the jungle, he said, \u201cNothing but accomplishing my duty.\u201d \n \n In an editorial, The Mainichi Shimbun, a leading Tokyo newspaper, said: \u201cTo this soldier, duty took precedence over personal sentiments. Onoda has shown us that there is much more in life than just material affluence and selfish pursuits. There is the spiritual aspect, something we may have forgotten.\u201d \n \n After his national welcome in Japan, Mr. Onoda was examined by doctors, who found him in amazingly good condition. He was given a military pension and signed a $160,000 contract for a ghostwritten memoir, \u201cNo Surrender: My-Thirty Year War.\u201d As his story went global in books, articles and documentaries, he tried to lead a normal life. \n \n He went dancing, took driving lessons and traveled up and down the Japanese islands. But he found himself a stranger in a strange land, disillusioned with materialism and overwhelmed by changes. \u201cThere are so many tall buildings and automobiles in Tokyo,\u201d he said. \u201cTelevision might be convenient, but it has no influence on my life here.\u201d \n \n In 1975 he moved to a Japanese colony in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, where he raised cattle. The following year he married Machie Onuku, a Japanese tea-ceremony teacher. The couple returned to Japan in 1984 and founded the Onoda Nature School, a survival-skills youth camp. Mr. Onoda revisited Lubang, the site of his long holdout, in 1996 and gave $10,000 to a school there. In recent years he lived in Japan and in Brazil, where he was made an honorary citizen in 2010. \n \n Hiroo Onoda was born on March 19, 1922, in Kainan, Wakayama, in central Japan, one of seven children of Tanejiro and Tamae Onoda. At 17 he went to work for a trading company in Wuhan, China, which Japanese forces had occupied in 1938. In 1942 he joined the Japanese Army, was singled out for special training and attended the Nakano School, the army\u2019s training center for intelligence officers. He studied guerrilla warfare, philosophy, history, martial arts, propaganda and covert operations. \n \n It was in late December 1944 that he arrived on Lubang, a strategic island 16 miles long and 6 miles wide on the southwestern approach to Manila Bay and the island of Corregidor. His orders were to sabotage harbor installations and an airstrip to disrupt a coming American invasion. But superior officers on the island superseded those orders to focus on preparations for a Japanese evacuation. \n \n When American forces landed on Feb. 28, 1945, and the last Japanese fled or were killed, Maj. Yoshimi Taniguchi gave Lieutenant Onoda his final orders, to stand and fight. \u201cIt may take three years, it may take five, but whatever happens we\u2019ll come back for you,\u201d the major promised. \n \n Twenty-nine years later, the retired major, by then a bookseller, returned to Lubang at Tokyo\u2019s request to fulfill his promise. Japan had lost the war, he said, and the lieutenant was relieved of duty. The ragged soldier saluted and wept. ||||| TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Hiroo Onoda, the last Japanese imperial soldier to emerge from hiding and surrender 29 years after the end of World War II, has died.

(Associated Press) \n \n Onoda died Thursday at a Tokyo hospital after a brief stay there. Chief government spokesman Yoshihide Suga on Friday expressed his condolences, praising Onoda for his strong will to live and indomitable spirit. \n \n \"After World War II, Mr. Onoda lived in the jungle for many years and when he returned to Japan, I felt that finally, the war was finished. That's how I felt,\" Suga said. \n \n Onoda was an intelligence officer who came out of hiding on Lubang island in the Philippines in March 1974, on his 52nd birthday. He surrendered only when his former commander flew there to reverse his 1945 orders to stay behind and spy on American troops. \n \n Onoda and another World War II holdout, Sgt. Shoichi Yokoi, who emerged from the jungle in 1972, received massive heroes' welcomes upon returning home. \n \n In his formal surrender to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Onoda wore his 30-year-old imperial army uniform, cap and sword, all still in good condition. \n \n After the initial sensation of his return wore off, Onoda bought a ranch in Brazil. He later was head of a children's nature school in northern Japan. \n \n \"I don't consider those 30 years a waste of time,\" Onoda said in a 1995 interview with The Associated Press. \"Without that experience, I wouldn't have my life today.\" \n \n Onoda worked for a Japanese trading firm in Shanghai after finishing high school in 1939. Three years later, he was drafted and trained at a military academy. \n \n In December 1944, he was sent to Lubang, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of Manila. Most other Japanese soldiers surrendered when U.S. troops landed on Lubang in February 1945, though hundreds remained missing for years after the war. \n \n As he struggled to feed himself, Onoda's mission became one of survival. He stole rice and bananas from local people down the hill, and shot their cows to make dried beef, triggering occasional shooting at each other. \n \n The turning point came on Feb. 20, 1974, when he met a young globe-trotter, Norio Suzuki, who ventured to Lubang in pursuit of Onoda. \n \n Suzuki returned to Japan and contacted the government, which located Onoda's superior \u2014 Maj. Yoshimi Taniguchi \u2014 and flew him to Lubang to deliver his surrender order in person. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Mari Yamaguchi contributed to this report.",

The straggler formally surrendered\u2014still wearing his uniform\u2014to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos after his former commander flew out to rescind his 1945 order that Onoda stay there and spy on American forces, the AP reports. The New York Times reports that Onoda was with three comrades on Lubang Island when the war ended; believing leaflets attesting to the war's end to be Allied propaganda, they lived off bananas, coconuts, stolen rice, and cows they killed, and constructed bamboo huts. One of the men surrendered five years later; the others were shot and killed by police, the last just two years before Onoda emerged. The Guardian reports that he \"wept uncontrollably\" when he eventually gave up his rifle\u2014still \"perfectly serviceable\" after all those years, and one he may have used to kill as many as 30 locals that he mistook for enemies. A Japanese government spokesman praised Onoda for his unbreakable spirit: \"After World War II, Mr. Onoda lived in the jungle for many years and when he returned to Japan, I felt that finally, the war was finished.

If locals dont know her personally, they know of her. It's a tight-knit community, one thats hurting as they wait for answers. \n \n \"I've never seen her miss a day since I've been here,\" said Scott Ehlers, who works as a parking attendant in the lot near the ferry terminal on Cousin's Island. \n \n He said Westra, 47, is a regular. He checks her parking permit and she greets him with a smile. \n \n \"She goes over there everyday,\" Ehlers said. \"Does her job. And everyone over there loves her.\" \n \n Westra teaches third through fifth grades at the island's school, which is being renovated. The superintendent declined to speak on camera, but tells CBS 13 it's a very tough time and they want her to come home. \n \n Fire Chief Ralph Munroe went to the mainland with seven others on Tuesday to help with the search effort. \n \n \"Everybody wants to do something and we're just fortunate enough to be able to help out in that manner,\" Munroe said. \n \n Greta Morrissette heard the heartbreak is taking a toll, so she came over to lend a hand at the daycare where many of the teachers and kids know Westra. \n \n \"Just kinda be here,\" she said. \"I brought bagels.\" \n \n The Chebeague Island United Methodist Church is bringing islanders together in a similar way, by offering space for prayer and reflection. Earlier this week it hosted dinner for anyone struggling to make sense of Westra's disappearance. \n \n \"Everyone knows everyone and we all love and care for her as part of our beloved community,\" said Pastor Melissa Yosua-Davis. ||||| NORTH YARMOUTH \u2014 Children playing in the woods Friday morning discovered a woman\u2019s body less than half a mile from the home of missing teacher Kristin Westra. \n \n Police said they could not confirm that the woman was Westra and were awaiting positive identification from the state Medical Examiner\u2019s Office before releasing more information. However, Westra\u2019s husband, Jay Westra, posted publicly on his Facebook page shortly after police announced a body had been found: \u201cMy heart was crushed today.\u201d \n \n Related Headlines Missing teacher sought help for anxiety the day before she disappeared, husband says \n \n The autopsy likely will take place over the weekend, said Capt. Craig Smith of the Cumberland County Sheriff\u2019s Office. He would not say who found the body or disclose any information about its discovery near a house on Gray Road about 10:30 a.m. Friday. A man who lives at the house said that his grandchildren had found it. \n \n Several cars were parked at the Westra home on Lufkin Road on Friday afternoon. One man told a reporter, \u201cAs you can imagine, we\u2019re all in shock, and we\u2019re not going to be saying anything right now.\u201d \n \n A group of Kristin Westra\u2019s friends and co-workers at the Chebeague Island School who had gathered in Yarmouth on Friday also said they didn\u2019t want to talk. \u201cThings are still so raw,\u201d one woman said. \n \n Westra was last seen Sunday night and police, wardens and volunteers had been searching the area around her home since Monday, when her husband woke up and discovered that she had left, without her car or cellphone. \n \n Jay Westra later said in an interview with NBC News that his wife was experiencing anxiety and had a safety \u201cassessment\u201c Sunday before she disappeared from their home. She was under a lot of stress from renovations at the school where she taught and also at home, which she shared with her husband, their daughter and his son. \n \n \u201cSunday morning, Kristin was experiencing what I would call some anxiety and she expressed that she had some sleepless nights and was worried,\u201d Jay Westra said. \n \n Searchers spent Tuesday and Wednesday bushwhacking through thick trees and brush in a roughly 1.5-mile radius around the Westras\u2019 home. \n \n The active search parties were reduced Thursday but continued throughout the day. The search resumed Friday morning with several K-9 teams and then officials converged on the house on Gray Road, or Route 115, which runs almost parallel to Lufkin Road, with a large tract of woods in between. \n \n On Friday night, Ed Gervais, who lives in the house, said his grandchildren had found the body in the woods. He was at work at the time, but said his wife, Joyce, was at home. \n \n Asked if his grandchildren were all right, Gervais said, \u201cI hope so\u201d before declining to comment further. \n \n Crime scene tape was in front of his house during the day, but officials would not say whether the body was found on that property, which was within the 1.5-mile radius of the Westras\u2019 home on Lufkin Road. \n \n On Wednesday, the Maine Warden Service had said that the search had \u201celiminated with high probability\u201d that Westra was within the search zone scoured by wardens, police and dogs. Asked Friday night about how searchers might have missed Westra\u2019s body in that sweep, Smith said in an email \u201cthat question has been asked and it is being researched.\u201d \n \n Kristin Westra\u2019s brother, Eric Rohrbach, has described his sister as an early riser and as someone who is active and fit, and that leaving the home without telling anyone or having a way to communicate was deeply out of character for her. \n \n Jay Westra said Kristin was not on any medication, and said he would have supported her if she said she needed some time away. After the visit with a medical professional Sunday, Kristin had planned to have blood work done Monday. She also had a plan to return to her usual running and yoga \u2013 activities that had been disrupted by the start of school and the renovation project at their home \u2013 and to make slight changes to her diet and her sleep patterns. \n \n \u201cShe told me she felt better. We had a plan,\u201d Jay Westra said. \u201cKristin is a person who when she has a plan, she sticks to the plan and she follows through and she does things well, every time.\u201d \n \n A candlelight vigil had been planned for Westra at the Congregational Church in Cumberland on Saturday at 5 p.m. It wasn\u2019t clear late Friday afternoon whether that would still happen. \n \n Staff writer Mary Pols contributed to this report. \n \n Eric Russell can be contacted at 791-6344 or at: \n \n [email protected] \n \n Share \n \n < Previous \n \n Next > \n \n filed under: ||||| The Senate officially confirmed Brett Kavanaugh Saturday as the next Supreme Court justice -- but the vote, like the controversial confirmation process, was anything but smooth. \n \n Interested in Supreme Court?

I thought it was really good. I think a lot of very positive things happened in the last week. It didn't look that way but in the end, that's what happened.\" \n \n As for Kavanaugh, Trump said \"he's going in looking really good.\" \n \n Mark Wilson/Getty Images \n \n White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that Trump called Kavanaugh to congratulate him while onboard Air Force One as he headed to a campaign rally in Kansas. \n \n Trump told reporters that his speech in Mississippi on Tuesday, days before the vote, had an effect on Kavanaugh's nomination. During that speech, Trump appeared to mock Christine Blasey Ford's testimony about her alleged assault at the hands of Kavanaugh. The judge has denied the accusations. \n \n \"I think the Mississippi speech had a great impact, yes. I think it was a very important thing,\" Trump said on the plane Saturday. \n \n \"He was chosen for the reason of his temperament, his incredible past, his outstanding years on the court.

Susan Collins, a key undecided vote, announced on the Senate floor that, despite allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against him, \"I will vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh.\" \n \n Just hours earlier, with Kavanaugh's fate still uncertain, the full Senate had voted 51-49 to end debate and advance the nomination, after an additional FBI investigation seemed to turn up nothing to corroborate the allegations. \n \n \"This is not a criminal trial, and I do not believe that claims such as these need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Collins said in a lengthy speech defending her decision. \n \n The Maine moderate Republican faced heavy political pressure, including from women who came from her home state and demanded that she side with Kavanaugh's chief accuser, Ford. \n \n Collins' declaration of support for Kavanaugh was quickly followed by West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, another key undecided vote, who issued a statement saying he, too, would vote \"yes,\" giving Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell the support he needed to get Kavanaugh confirmed, even if by one of the narrowest margins in history for a high court nominee. \n \n Manchin, a red state Democrat in a close re-election fight, said that while he had \"reservations' given the accusations, he did what was \"best for West Virginia,\" persuaded Kavanaugh will \"follow the Constitution.\" Protesters shouted \"shame\" at him as he tried to board an elevator near his office. \n \n Ford's attorneys said their client has no regrets. \n \n \"I think she feels good about the fact that she came forward and did what she felt strongly was her civic duty to do, which is to provide the information she had to the Judiciary Committee so that they could make a better decision -- a more informed decision,\" her attorney Lisa Banks told ABC News' Congressional Correspondent Mary Bruce. \n \n When asked if Ford will ever be able to live a normal life again, her lawyer seemed optimistic. \n \n \"She's going to go back to teaching. She loves being a teacher. She's very good at it,\" attorney Debra Katz said. \"And she's looking forward to getting back to her family and her friends and her job.

    "document": "Story highlights Law says doctors can't perform abortions without admitting privileges in nearby hospitals \n \n Planned Parenthood files suit \n \n The judge sides with the group \n \n The restraining order will stay in place until another hearing next week \n \n A Wisconsin federal judge has granted a temporary restraining order preventing the state from enforcing a new and restrictive abortion law. \n \n The law, signed by Gov. Scott Walker on Friday, bans doctors from performing abortions if they don't have admitting privileges to hospitals within 30 minutes of their practice. \n \n U.S. District Judge William Conley granted the hold Monday after the Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin filed suit. \n \n The group alleges the admitting privilege requirement is unconstitutional and treats doctors who perform abortions differently from doctors who perform other types of medical procedures. \n \n Conley agreed. \n \n \"There is a troubling lack of justification for the hospital admitting privileges requirement,\" he wrote in his 19-page ruling. \n \n He added that the U.S. Supreme Court precedent places the burden upon states to show such laws are \"reasonably directed to the preservation of maternal health.\" \n \n To that end, \"the record to date strongly supports a finding that no medical purpose is served by this requirement,\" he said. \n \n The restraining order will stay in place pending a fuller hearing on July 17. \n \n The law, which took effect Monday, also requires women to have an ultrasound before getting an abortion, but that portion of the law was not challenged in the Planned Parenthood suit. \n \n Opponents of the Wisconsin legislation allege that restrictions in the law would force the closing of several abortion clinics, and that the law is simply a way to make access to abortions more difficult. \n \n Supporters insist that it would guarantee a safer environment for a woman suffering from abortion-related complications. \n \n Judge Conley questioned that contention, saying, \"The current system already handles efficiently the very low percentage of women seeking abortions with serious complications.\" \n \n CNN reached out to Walker's office for response and is awaiting a response. ||||| SHARE Poll Do you agree with the judge's decision to delay state law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges? Yes No vote View Results Yes: 65% No: 35% Total Responses: 3280 \n \n By of the \n \n Madison \u2014 After a hastily called hearing, a federal judge Monday put a 10-day freeze on a new state law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have hospital-admitting privileges. \n \n In a 19-page opinion issued Monday evening, U.S. District Judge William M. Conley cited a \"troubling lack of justification\" for the law and said he would stay enforcement of the admissions provision until July 18, a day after a more deliberate courtroom hearing scheduled before him next week. \n \n \"There will almost certainly be irreparable harm to those women who will be foreclosed from having an abortion in the next week either because of the undue burden of travel or the late stage of pregnancy, as well as facing increasing health risks caused by delay,\" the judge wrote. \"Since the state has failed to date to demonstrate any benefit to maternal health of imposing this restriction, there is no meaningful counterweight recognized by the United States Supreme Court to justify the act's immediate enforcement.\" \n \n Conley's ruling does not affect a separate provision of the new law requiring women to undergo an ultrasound before having an abortion. At next week's hearing Conley could potentially choose to reinstate the full law or keep it blocked. \n \n Abortion clinics filed the lawsuit in federal court in Madison on Friday immediately after Gov. Scott Walker privately signed the law, which went into effect Monday. The measure had been expected to cut the number of clinics offering abortions in Wisconsin from four to two and cause one of the remaining clinics to sharply reduce the number of abortions it provides, according to the operators of the clinics. \n \n Without Conley's action, one clinic would have had to cancel 30 abortions or related appointments, with additional cancellations also needed at the other two clinics, attorneys for the plaintiffs said Monday. \n \n A spokeswoman for the Department of Justice, which is defending the law, had no comment on the temporary stay. Lester Pines, an attorney representing Planned Parenthood who had been briefed on the ruling, called it a \"very good decision\" that would prevent clinics in Milwaukee and Appleton from having to cancel procedures this week. \n \n In court Monday afternoon, Pines pointed to the Wisconsin Medical Society's opposition to the law, saying that key doctors groups had publicly said the law is not needed to protect women's health. The measure was intended to limit access to abortions, he argued. \n \n \"The state cannot show that there is a legitimate medical purpose for this,\" Pines said. \n \n Pines cited a declaration in the case signed by Douglas Laube, a former chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Wisconsin and president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \n \n \"This requirement is medically unjustified and will have serious consequences for women's health in Wisconsin,\" Laube said in the declaration. \n \n Backers of the law, which also requires women seeking abortions to get ultrasounds, have said the measure could benefit both fetuses and pregnant women and the law will ultimately be upheld by the courts. \n \n Daniel Lennington, an assistant attorney general with the state Department of Justice, focused in Monday's hearing on what he said are the potential benefits of the law compared with its other effects. \n \n \"I don't think that the plaintiffs have provided any proof that a woman's right to an abortion is unduly burdened,\" Lennington told Conley. \n \n Planned Parenthood and Affiliated Medical Services brought the federal lawsuit against state Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen, Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne, Safety and Professional Services Secretary Dave Ross and the members of the state Medical Examining Board \u2014 all of whom have authority to enforce the law or issue sanctions. \n \n Planned Parenthood has abortion clinics in Milwaukee, Madison and Appleton; Affiliated has one in Milwaukee. A fifth Wisconsin clinic that offers abortions, in Green Bay, plans to stop offering abortion services on Aug. 1 for reasons unrelated to the admitting privileges law, according to the suit. \n \n Teri Huyck, president and chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said last week that without a stay, her group would have had to close its Appleton abortion clinic and offer at least 50% fewer abortions at its Milwaukee facility. Affiliated would have to close its Milwaukee clinic, according to the suit. \n \n That would mean abortions in Wisconsin would not be available north of Madison, and after the 19th week of pregnancy would not be available anywhere in the state, according to the groups' complaint. \n \n The clinics asked the court to immediately block the law, contending it violates the constitution's due process guarantee, puts an undue burden on a woman's right to choose abortion and unconstitutionally treats doctors who perform abortions differently than doctors who perform other procedures. \n \n Lennington argued that northern Wisconsin residents could still receive abortions in Milwaukee, Madison, Chicago or the Twin Cities and that the additional drive wasn't an undue burden. But Conley noted the driving conditions that can prevail in wintry northern Wisconsin. \n \n \"You haven't driven those roads very often,\" he said. \n \n In his ruling, Conley, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, also said the law will lead to delays in receiving abortions and that many women receiving the procedure at the affected clinics are poor and may find the additional travel beyond their means. \n \n Challenges to similar laws in other states have had some success, at least initially. Nationally, the matter will likely ultimately be decided by higher courts, according to legal experts on both sides of the issue. \n \n The bill's proponents have said the law was aimed at providing the best available health care for women and ensuring they have an opportunity to see the fetus on an ultrasound monitor and consider the decision to have an abortion in the light of that. \n \n Susan Armacost, a lobbyist for Wisconsin Right to Life, said last week that clinics should be able to get admitting privileges if they have competent doctors. \n \n Citing Laube's declaration and a 1999 study, Pines said Monday that abortion is an outpatient service that requires hospitalization in only 0.3% of cases. When it does, patients quickly get into nearby hospitals without problems under the existing system, he said. \n \n Pines said getting admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles would be impossible in some cases because some hospitals require physicians to admit a certain numbers of patients annually, and abortion doctors rarely have reason to admit patients to hospitals. \n \n \"The Legislature has set up a catch-22,\" Pines said after the hearing. \n \n Lennington said that figure cited by Pines showed complications do sometimes occur after abortions but told Conley he could not verify the statistic on such short notice. \n \n \"That's the best I can do at this time, your honor,\" he said. \n \n Larry Dupuis, an American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin attorney representing Affiliated Medical Services, said Monday that 30 appointments scheduled for Tuesday at the group's Milwaukee clinic would have had to be canceled if the law remained in place.",

Their marine services business was closed Sunday, and the answering system message was changed midday to remove Romeo's cellphone number. \n \n This map shows where a pickup truck plowed into a limo in Cutchogue on Saturday, July 18, 2015, leaving four women dead.

Pino has not been charged with any crime. \n \n advertisement | advertise on newsday \n \n In a statement, company officials called the crash \"a tragic accident on what should have been a happy day for a group of young women. We pray for the victims and for the families as they go though this unimaginable time.\" \n \n \"We are in direct contact with all authorities and we are providing all information that they have requested for their investigation,\" Ultimate Class Limousine officials said in the statement. \n \n One of the last stops the limo took the women to was Vineyard 48, located on the south side of Route 48, just west of Depot Lane. The limo was trying to make a U-turn on Depot when Romeo's pickup broadsided its right side, officials said. \n \n Dimonte had surgery at Peconic Bay Medical Center Sunday and is in stable condition, according to Samantha Vigliotta, vice president of the center's foundation and external affairs.

Lipets' mother, father, uncle, aunt, and boyfriend were by her side, Drurer said. \n \n advertisement | advertise on newsday \n \n The crash was the second multifatal wreck on Long Island in a week. Three members of a Queens family -- the father and two young children -- died July 12 when their car was rear-ended by an alleged drunken driver on the Southern State Parkway at the exit for Robert Moses Causeway. \n \n The Cutchogue intersection where the limousine crash occurred has long been a worry to residents because of the convergence of vineyard-bound limousines making U-turns amid oncoming traffic on the rural road. It was not known if the limo cut in front of the truck, Southold Police Chief Martin Flatley said Saturday night. \n \n \"He [the pickup truck driver] hit the brakes right before and he broadsided the limo right on the passenger side,\" he said. \n \n Flower bouquets had been placed in the roadway median at the crash site Sunday. \n \n William Rule, 64, was among those dropping off bouquets. He had picked lilies from his garden in Riverhead, he said. \n \n He said he did not know the victims but felt the tragedy was \"so horrific\" he needed to contribute to the growing memorial. \n \n \"This traditionally had been a quiet area, not very busy,\" he said of the North Fork's vineyard region, but noted it has become \"built up and more of an attraction.\" ||||| They were all 23 and 24 years old, their whole lives seemingly ahead of them. \n \n They were visiting the North Fork to celebrate a major event in one of their friend\u2019s lives. \n \n Then, as the driver of the limousine they had booked to help keep them safe during a trip to local wineries attempted to make a U-turn on Route 48 and Depot Lane in Cutchogue, the lives of the four friends came to a tragic end Saturday. \n \n Steve Romeo, 55, of Southold was charged with driving while intoxicated after his pickup truck allegedly t-boned the limousine while traveling west along County Road 48 shortly after 5 p.m. \n \n The crash took the lives of Brittney Schulman, 23, of Smithtown; Lauren Baruch, 24, of Smithtown; Stephanie Belli, 23, of Kings Park; and Amy Grabina, 23, of Commack. \n \n Three of the victims died at the scene and the fourth died at Peconic Bay Medical Center, Southold Town Police Chief Martin Flatley said. \n \n Injured but surviving the crash were four additional passengers: Joelle Dimonti, 25, of Elwood; Melissa Crai, 23, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; Alicia Arundel, 24, of Setauket; and Olga Lipets, 24, of Brooklyn. The limousine driver, 58-year-old Carlos Pino of Bethpage, was treated for non-life threatening injuries at a Suffolk County hospital. \n \n The limo had just left Vineyard 48 and was heading east before Mr. Pino attempted the ill-fated turn. \n \n Fire crews from Cutchogue, Mattituck, East Marion, Greenport, Southold and Jamesport all responded to the scene. Two Suffolk County police helicopters assisted in the rescue, landing directly on Route 48, which remained closed in both directions for several hours. The road was open again by 11:40 p.m. \n \n The crash scene was devastating to those with the misfortune to drive past it Saturday. \n \n \u201cAs we came around, all we saw were bodies out the left side of the vehicle, hanging out,\u201d said Lynne Lulfs, a Hampton Bays woman who witnessed the crash. \u201cIt was surreal; it did not look real.\u201d \n \n Witnessing the tragedy hit home for Ms. Lulfs, who said her father died in a car accident when she was young. \n \n \u201cThis will resonate with us forever,\u201d she said. \n \n People who live near the intersection said it\u2019s a frequent spot for crashes. Ruth Urwand, who lives on Depot Lane, said she believes a regular stoplight should replace the blinking light that\u2019s currently there. \n \n Assistant Suffolk County District Attorney Elizabeth Miller said additional charges are expected in the case, as Mr. Romeo is currently facing just one misdemeanor drunk driving charge. \n \n \u201cAt this time we are continuing the investigation and looking at upgrading the charges significantly,\u201d she said, adding that Mr. Romeo is due in Southold Town Justice Court Friday. \n \n When asked about the emotional state of his client, defense attorney Dan O\u2019Brien of Nesconset said \u201cIt\u2019s a tough, tough situation.\u201d He declined to say where Mr. Romeo was headed at the time of the crash. \n \n Ms. Miller said one of the women was \u201ca bride\u201d and that the friends were celebrating \u201can upcoming event.\u201d \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t believe it was a bridal party, but they were celebrating,\u201d she said in reference to reports that the women were visiting the North Fork for a bachelorette party. \n \n News of the fatal crash led friends and family of the victims to post memories of them on social media. \n \n An anguished man who answered the phone at Ms. Baruch\u2019s house Sunday afternoon declined to comment, saying only that he couldn\u2019t talk. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d he said. \n \n One Commack woman, who asked to be identified only as the mother of one of Ms. Grabina\u2019s friends, said \u201cShe was such a vibrant girl.\u201d \n \n \u201cShe tried everything,\u201d the woman said. \u201cShe was young \u2014 a young girl. I can\u2019t even imagine what her parents are going through right now.\u201d \n \n According to her Facebook profile, Ms. Grabina graduated from Florida State University in 2014 and had been hired less than a month ago as a staff accountant at New York City firm Ernst & Young. \n \n Mr. Romeo pleaded not guilty at his bedside arraignment at Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport, where he is being treated for non-life threatening injuries. Southold Town Justice Rudolph Bruer set bail at $500,000 cash or $1 million bond. \n \n The Southold businessman was previously involved in a fatal accident in January 2014 at a construction site in Mattituck, where a 30-year-old worker was struck in the head and killed by a bucket that fell off of a skid-steer loader being operated by Mr. Romeo. He was not charged in that incident, but the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued citations and fined the business, in part because Mr. Romeo had not been trained to use the equipment he was operating. \n \n A wrongful death suit filed by the worker\u2019s family against Romeo Dimon Marine and the owner of the construction site is pending in New York State Supreme Court, online court records show. \n \n A representative from Romeo Dimon Marine\u2019s Southold office declined to comment on the fatal crash Sunday morning. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a private matter,\u201d he told a Suffolk Times reporter, declining to identify himself. \u201cIt has nothing to do with business.

Steven Romeo, 55, made the plea today from a Long Island hospital bed where he's recovering from injuries sustained in the crash, the New York Times reports. His bail is set at $1 million bond or $500,000 cash. \"Right now, we\u2019re continuing the investigation and looking into upgrading the charges significantly,\" says assistant DA Elizabeth Miller, who adds that the limo driver won't be charged. Meanwhile, Romeo's lawyer denied media reports that Romeo was driving drunk or fled the scene, but said little else. Details are emerging about the accident, in which a bride-to-be and seven of her friends were riding in a limousine just after 5pm on Route 48 in Cutchogue, NY. \"I don\u2019t believe it was a bridal party, but they were celebrating,\" Miller tells the Suffolk Times. The limo was negotiating a U-turn at a crossroad that has two flashing yellow lights going west and east to caution drivers, Newsday reports. That's when Romeo's pickup slammed into the limo with such force that it tore almost totally through the vehicle. An eyewitness says Romeo sat there, bloodied and incoherent, holding a water bottle. Dead in the crash are Lauren Baruch, 24, Stephanie Belli, 23, Amy R. Grabina, 23, and Brittney Schulman, 23. A local boat repairman, Romeo was involved in another fatality last year when a bucket fell off a skid-steer loader he was operating at a construction site, killing a 30-year-old worker\u2014but while citations and fines were issued, Romeo wasn't charged, partly because he hadn't been trained to operate the equipment.",

Now we're moving on to our next goal: to have them include an epilepsy warning in the Blu-Ray release of the film. This can set a precedent to make movies (both in the theater and at home) safer for all viewers. ||||| More from USA Today: \n \n Even Sophia Bush has a 'lady crush' on Voyd, her breakout 'Incredibles 2' hero \n \n 'Incredibles 2' soars with $180M: Biggest opening ever for an animated film \n \n The definitive ranking of all 20 Pixar movies (including 'Incredibles 2') \n \n AMC supervisor Mauricio Mencia, who's worked at the Universal CityWalk location in Los Angeles for the past year, says, \"I've never seen something like that happen.\" \n \n The memo, which has been shared on social media, says: \" 'Incredibles 2' contains a sequence of flashing lights, which may affect customers who are susceptible to photosensitive epilepsy or other photosensitivities.\" \n \n Mencia's theater has informed the staff about the memo and posted the warning next to the guest greeter who rips tickets. \n \n According to the Epilepsy Foundation, \"for about 3 percent of people with epilepsy, exposure to flashing lights at certain intensities, or with certain visual patterns, can trigger seizures. This condition is known as photosensitive epilepsy and it's more common in children and adolescents, especially those with generalized epilepsy and a type known as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.\" \n \n Jackie Aker, director of media relations for the Epilepsy Foundation, says her organization had never before called for a movie to issue a photosensitivity warning, but earlier this year asked Apple to change a promotional spot for the new iPad that had flashing lights that would be unsafe for certain viewers. Apple worked with the foundation to change the video. \n \n In 1997, an episode of \"Pok\u00e9mon\" that aired in Japan with flashing lights sent nearly 700 children to the hospital. ||||| This is not a joke. I was at a first-night showing tonight, and my immediate thought was how disasterously unsafe this movie is for my photosensitive epilepic friends. @markingatlightspeed I\u2019m tagging you with this specifically because I feel that this would be extremely dangerous for you to watch. \n \n \n \n There are multiple scenes in this movie with full-screen, black-and-white flashing strobe effects. They all happen without warning, and last anywhere between a few seconds to more than two minutes. In a darkened movie theater, this means the likelihood of a seizure could be VERY HIGH if you are sensitive to these effects. \n \n \n \n If you have photosensitive epilepsy or another disorder that is triggered by strobe lights, I would highly recommend you DO NOT SEE THE INCREDIBLES 2 IN THEATERS. Wait until the movie\u2019s released on digital/Bluray, and you can watch it in a fully-lit room, with someone with you who will be able to help if the strobe effects do trigger a seizure. \n \n \n \n Please stay safe. \n \n \n \n UPDATE: After talking to some people who have loved ones with severe epilepsy, I would sadly have to recommend that you DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE - PERIOD - IF YOU HAVE SEVERE SEIZURES WHEN EXPOSED TO STROBE EFFECTS. DO NOT PUT YOUR HEALTH AT RISK FOR A MOVIE. NO KIND OF MEDIA IS WORTH GAMBLING WITH YOUR LIFE. \n \n \n \n The scenes in which the flashing happens are MAJOR plot points and CANNOT be skipped. The one workaround I can suggest would be to find a version of the movie (when it\u2019s released) with Audio Descriptions for the visually impaired. Watch it on your PC - turn the monitor OFF, but keep the audio going. \n \n \n \n If you have been disappointed by the creative decisions made by Disney-Pixar, please sign the petition created by @moviehealthcommunity for Disney to include a seizure warning for moviegoers and people who buy/rent the movie. It is unlikely they would edit these things out of the movie entirely - but there are nearly 20,000 notes on this post, and if 20,000 people asked them to consider people with epilepsy, it could mean they consider these things more carefully in the future. \n \n \n \n Thank you.",

    "document": "Take a Break! \n \n The page you're looking for was moved, removed, renamed or may have never existed ||||| Sony started the fireworks Wednesday for Paul Feig\u2019s estrogen-fueled reboot of Ghostbusters by showing off the trailer in advance before a select group to standing-ovation results. The movie is slated for a July 15 release. \n \n Since the project was first announced and kept largely under wraps (some actors\u2019 reps weren\u2019t even privy to the pages their clients were reading), Ghostbusters has faced its fair share of scrutiny by the media for changing the protagonists from men to women. Feig told the crowd at the Sony mini-event that he\u2019s \u201crelieved for the moment, before it\u2019s released to the world.\u201d Producer Ivan Reitman was more certain about the crowd\u2019s response to the trailer, saying, \u201cI\u2019m confident.\u201d \n \n To the point of the creative decision to switch the genders on Ghostbusters, Feig explained: \u201cGhostbusters are for everybody. The first movie worked because it had four of the funniest people and I just want the funniest people \u2014 and the funniest people are these women.\u201d \n \n Added screenwriter and co-producer Katie Dippold, who worked with Feig on The Heat, \u201cThis is a story, if you placed men in those characters, you could do it. It\u2019s pretty genderless.\u201d \n \n The reboot was one of the last big projects pushed through by former Sony chief Amy Pascal during her tenure at the studio before The Hack took its toll on the studio. For years, Sony wanted to reboot the film with Bill Murray returning as Peter Venkman and chased him with two scripts. But it was a challenge to get him to read them. Reitman was always a part of the equation. Following the death of Ghostbusters star and scribe Harold Ramis in 2014, Reitman decided to turn over the directing reins. \n \n Not much has been known until now about the film. Kristen Wiig playsparticle physicist Erin, Melissa McCarthy\u2019s character is an expert in the paranormal, Kate McKinnon\u2019s the nuclear engineer who creates the team\u2019s inventions, and Leslie Jones is a former subway employee who knows her way around New York City. \n \n The plot per Wiig\u2019s character? As she described her, \u201cSomeone had created a device that has amplified paranormal activity and we might be the only ones who can stop it.\u201d Feig mentioned that a number of the Ghostbusters staples that we\u2019re familiar with will definitely make their way into the film, hopefully in a surprising way. Count on a cameo by the round, fat, toothy ghost Slimer, who Reitman said was initially nicknamed in early drafts of the first film as \u201cThe Belushi ghost, because he ate all the time.\u201d Dan Ackroyd originally conceived Ghostbusters as a vehicle for him and his SNL and Blues Brothers pal. \n \n As far as the music goes, Feig says it\u2019s essential to have a portion of the original Ray Parker Jr. title song in the movie. There also will be a new version of that tune. As to whether they\u2019re reusing Elmer Bernstein\u2019s now-familiar themes, Feig said that composer Theodore Shapiro is \u201cdoing an amazing theme and we\u2019re playing with a lot of different themes. I want this to be big, spooky and cool.\u201d Feig worked with Shapiro on Spy. \n \n A majority of those who showed up, and even flew into L.A. for the event at Sony\u2019s Cary Grant Theatre, were mega-fans, guys who dress up like Ghostbusters and visit children\u2019s hospitals around the country. After the trailer ran a first time, they shouted for it to play again. \n \n Previously announced, Sony also has a guy counterpart Ghostbusters in the works as announced by Deadline last March with Channing Tatum producing and Joe and Anthony Russo directing. ||||| Trailer Frenzy A special place to find the newest trailers for movies and TV shows you're craving. \n \n After decades of waiting for a new Ghostbusters movie, here\u2019s your first footage from one. To celebrate the launch of this awesome trailer, we talked with director Paul Feig, producer Ivan Reitman and writer Katie Dippold, and they told us why this trailer reintroduces so many of the things we love. \n \n \n \n This trailer starts by nudging your nostalgia with familiar music and visuals. Then, once we get to the new stuff... it still feels familiar. We see a library ghost, Slimer, proton packs, and Ecto-1\u2014but everything is just slightly tweaked and modernized. Even the characters, three radically different scientists and a local resident, mirror the original film. Meanwhile, the humor feels a bit more physical than the first movie, which is in line with Feig\u2019s other movies (Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy) but it mostly works. Really, what you get here is simply, a brand new Ghostbusters. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Wednesday, speaking to an audience of super fans in Los Angeles (who stood and cheered the trailer, twice) as well as members of the press, Feig explained that the nostalgic feel of the trailer is part of the movie itself. \n \n \u201cI\u2019d be bummed if I didn\u2019t see the Ecto-1 and all that stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we wanted to make sure we give those nods\u2014but make them our own, and give them their own original origin story. When you see the movie, there will be a lot of things you\u2019re happy to see, but they\u2019re coming at you at a slightly different way.\u201d \n \n Make no mistake, despite the cameos, and the recognizable people, places and music, this new Ghostbusters is a reboot, not a sequel. The film-makers wanted to start from scratch, so this world, and these characters, would have to earn their place. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \u201cTo say ghosts have existed for 30 years [would be] a different world,\u201d Dippold said. \u201cIn the original it\u2019s so fun to see the ghosts unleashed for the first time and we didn\u2019t want to skip over it.\u201d \n \n Plus, Feig added, \u201cI didn\u2019t like the idea of them being handed technology. I wanted to see it developed.\u201d \n \n The fact that the characters develop the technology themselves is also one of the things that carries over from the first movie: Science is crucial to the film. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \u201cIt was really important to us to make them scientists,\u201d Feig said. \u201cThat\u2019s what I love about the first one, the idea that Ivan, Dan [Aykroyd] and Harold [Ramis] had\u2014people fighting the paranormal with science\u2014just really resonated with us.\u201d \n \n So in this movie, Erin, played by Kristen Wiig, is a particle physicist. Melissa McCarthy\u2019s character, Abby, is an expert in the paranormal. Kate McKinnon plays Jillian, a nuclear engineer who creates all the technology. Finally, Leslie Jones\u2019s Patty joins the team because she knows New York, and the film needed an \u201ceveryman,\u201d just like Winston in the original. \n \n Feig also said he cast these actresses because their on-screen personas line up perfectly with the characters. \u201cKristin is this kind of vulnerable comedian, Melissa is a headstrong comedian, then you\u2019ve got Kate who\u2019s just the weirdo-nut, and Leslie is just a powerhouse that comes at you,\u201d he said. \n \n Advertisement \n \n As for the ghosts our heroes are fighting, Feig wanted them to look very particular and familiar, before things begin to go off the walls. \u201cBeing such a science nut, I wanted these ghosts to be what I always considered a ghost to be, which is dead people coming back.\u201d he said. So the main ghosts of the movie are humanoid, but things will definitely change. \n \n Change has been at the heart of this new Ghostbusters from the beginning. Early on, a small but vocal group of people began complaining about the new team being all female. However, Feig said that\u2019s not addressed in the movie. \u201cThe first movie worked, because it had four of the funniest people in it,\u201d he said. \u201cI just wanted the funniest people, and the funniest people I happen to know are these women. Ghostbusters is for everybody\u201d \n \n And Feig sees this as the beginning of a new era of Ghostbusters. \u201cI have such a love for this property and what I really wanted to do was bring it to a new generation. Give a new generation their own team,\u201d he said. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \u201cThis comes from such a pure place,\u201d Feig continued. \u201cThis thing that [Reitman, Aykroyd and Ramis] created, this idea is such a great idea. It\u2019s such an amazing franchise that had two amazing movies, but it could just keep going. There\u2019s so many things you can do with it. It just seemed terrible to leave it in a box.\u201d \n \n Well, no matter what happens next, that box is finally opened again. \n \n \n \n Contact the author at germain@io9.com. ||||| Prime your proton packs, because it's not long now before the Ghostbusters reboot haunts theaters worldwide.

Alex Rodriguez, Ryan Braun, Nelson Cruz and Melky Cabrera are among the players whose names have been tied to the clinic. \n \n The agreement between Bosch and MLB was first reported by ESPN. \n \n In addition to Rodriguez, New York Yankees teammate Francisco Cervelli also was linked to the clinic. Cervelli said he consulted Biogenesis for a foot injury, but didn't receive any treatment. \n \n \"We'll let MLB handle everything and we don't really have a comment,\" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said after a 4-3 win over Cleveland. \n \n Girardi said the Yankees were still planning on Rodriguez rejoining the team after the All-Star break. The star third baseman has been on the disabled list all season. \n \n As for the drug cloud that has hovered over baseball for years, Girardi said: \"I think we all had hoped we'd gotten through it. But obviously, we haven't.\" \n \n Yankees outfielder Vernon Wells said it was too soon to draw any conclusions. \n \n \"Everything right now is speculative,\" Wells said. \"We can all sit here and wonder.\" \n \n MLB has sued Biogenesis of America and its operators, accusing them of scheming to provide banned PEDs to players in violation of their contracts. \n \n Miami New Times reported in January that it obtained purported records detailing drug purchases by Rodriguez, Cabrera, Cruz and former AL Cy Young Award winner Bartolo Colon. \n \n Yahoo Sports reported that Braun, the 2011 NL MVP, was mentioned in the records. \n \n Most have denied the Biogenesis link, although Rodriguez has admitted using performance-enhancing drugs earlier in his career and Colon and Cabrera each were suspended for 50 games last year for testing positive for elevated testosterone levels. \n \n Braun failed a drug test in 2011, but his suspension was overturned by an arbitrator. He has acknowledged that he was mentioned in Biogenesis records because his lawyers had used Bosch as consultant during the appeal. \n \n After the Brewers' 4-3 win in 10 innings over Oakland at Miller Park, Braun said he was done talking about the clinic. \n \n \"I've already addressed everything related to the Miami situation. I addressed it in spring training. I will not make any further statements about it,\" he said. \n \n \"The truth has not changed,\" he said. \n \n Braun said the speculation was not affecting him on the field. \n \n \"No, of course not. I've dealt with this for two years now. I'm pretty good at avoiding distractions,\" he said. ||||| Major League Baseball will seek to suspend about 20 players connected to the Miami-area clinic at the heart of an ongoing performance-enhancing drug scandal, including Alex Rodriguez and Ryan Braun, possibly within the next few weeks, \"Outside the Lines\" has learned. If the suspensions are upheld, the performance-enhancing drug scandal would be the largest in American sports history. \n \n Tony Bosch, right, flat-out denied any knowledge of suspected PED distribution at Biogenesis, his closed South Florida clinic, in an interview with ESPN's Pedro Gomez in April. ESPN \n \n Tony Bosch, founder of the now-shuttered Biogenesis of America, reached an agreement this week to cooperate with MLB's investigation, two sources told \"Outside the Lines,\" giving MLB the ammunition officials believe they need to suspend the players. \n \n One source familiar with the case said the commissioner's office might seek 100-game suspensions for Rodriguez, Braun and other players, the penalty for a second doping offense. The argument, the source said, is the players' connection to Bosch constitutes one offense, and previous statements to MLB officials denying any such connection or the use of PEDs constitute another. \n \n Bosch and his attorneys did not return several calls. MLB officials refused to comment when reached Tuesday. On Wednesday, union executive director Michael Weiner released a statement saying, \"The Players Association has every interest in both defending the rights of players and in defending the integrity of our joint program. We trust that the Commissioner's Office shares these interests.\" \n \n Sources said Bosch will meet with MLB officials in New York on Friday to begin sharing information and materials. He is expected to meet with lawyers and investigators for several days. The announcement of suspensions could follow within two weeks. \n \n Sources said discussions between Bosch and MLB were delayed while Bosch's lawyers spoke to the U.S. Attorney's office to get a sense of what sort of legal jeopardy Bosch might face. Before he would agree to a deal, sources said, he wanted an assurance that MLB could help mitigate any criminal exposure. MLB officials promised to do what they could, but do not have the power to stop a federal criminal investigation. \n \n Investigators have had records naming about 20 players for more than a month. But without a sworn statement from Bosch that the records are accurate and reflect illicit interactions between the players and the self-described biochemist, the documents are little more than a road map. \n \n Sources did not say what other materials, such as receipts and phone records, Bosch might provide, but said he has pledged to provide anything in his possession that could help MLB build cases against the players. Sources said MLB officials were not sure how many players might end up being pulled into the scandal; the 20 or so they know of have been identified through paperwork, but Bosch is expected to provide more. (Because some players are listed by their names and some by code names, officials are not yet certain whether some are redundant.) \n \n The development is a major break for MLB, which has pursued the case vigorously since Bosch's name was brought to MLB's attention last summer. In exchange for Bosch's full cooperation, sources said, Major League Baseball will drop the lawsuit it filed against Bosch in March, indemnify him for any liability arising from his cooperation, provide personal security for him and even put in a good word with any law enforcement agency that might bring charges against him. Sources said negotiations over the agreement, which lasted several weeks, stalled over the last point, as Bosch wanted the strongest assurances he could get that MLB would help mitigate any prosecution. \n \n At the same time, MLB is trying to secure the cooperation of at least two other former Bosch associates who have spoken to MLB investigators, as well as Juan Carlos Nunez, a registered agent who worked for longtime agents Seth and Sam Levinson and who is believed to have been a conduit between Bosch and numerous players. \n \n MLB already has established precedent to suspend a player for two offenses in one shot: Minor league player Cesar Carrillo was hit with a 100-game suspension in March when he was confronted with Biogenesis documents containing his name and then denied having any connection to Bosch or the clinic. \n \n However, because Carrillo was on a minor league contract and thus not a member of the MLB Players Association, he was not entitled to an appeal through arbitration. Major league players accused by MLB are expected to fight any suspension, and efforts to charge the players with multiple offenses would take that fight to another level. In the appeals process, players are allowed to confront witnesses and evidence in a courtroom-like procedure before an arbitration panel. \n \n Corroborating evidence against some players could prove difficult to come by. Several sources told ESPN that Bosch dealt only in cash and usually used friends as couriers, sometimes never seeing some of the athletes he served. \n \n In a recent interview with ESPN, his only one since the scandal broke, Bosch said he knew nothing about performance-enhancing drugs and that media accounts of his alleged PED distribution amounted to \"character assassination.\" \n \n \"I have been accused, tried and convicted in the media. And so I think [I] have been falsely accused throughout the media,\" he told ESPN's Pedro Gomez. \"I've done nothing wrong.\" \n \n But sources said Bosch has been feeling pressure from both the MLB lawsuit, which claims tortious interference, and a potential criminal investigation, and that he sees full cooperation with MLB as one of his only refuges. Several attorneys have said they don't think the lawsuit could survive a legal challenge, but Bosch likely would have to put up a costly fight in order to have the case dismissed. Several sources have told ESPN that Bosch is nearly broke, living alternately with family members and friends, and has tried unsuccessfully so far to revive his \"wellness\" business. \n \n The Florida Department of Health recently said it had sent Bosch a cease-and-desist letter and referred the case to law enforcement. MLB has tried to enlist the Drug Enforcement Agency, but no sources close to the clinic said they have been interviewed by any law enforcement agents and said they don't know of anyone who has been. \n \n MLB officials, though, traveled to Miami last month to take the deposition of anti-aging specialist Dr. Daniel Carpman, a former acquaintance of Bosch. Biogenesis documents from 2011 included prescription forms purportedly signed by Carpman, who previously told \"Outside the Lines'' that he didn't sign the forms. \n \n Bosch first came to MLB's attention in 2009 after Manny Ramirez, then with the Los Angeles Dodgers, tested positive for excessive levels of testosterone. While Ramirez appealed that finding, MLB officials discovered a prescription in Ramirez's medical file for human chorionic gonadotropin, another banned substance. The HCG prescription, sufficient evidence to suspend Ramirez, was written by Dr. Pedro Bosch, Tony's father, but sources said at the time that Tony Bosch actually had been facilitating Ramirez's drug use. MLB tried to get the DEA involved, but the agency took a pass. Ramirez was suspended for 50 games and was suspended a second time for 100 games in 2011 after he failed another test. \n \n Tony Bosch resurfaced last summer after several players, all with connections to the Miami area, tested positive for excessive levels of testosterone. Melky Cabrera, Bartolo Colon and Yasmani Grandal all received 50-game suspensions. When an ESPN reporter asked MLB officials about information that all three might have been connected to Bosch, MLB launched an investigation, sending several members of its Department of Investigations to South Florida, where they have repeatedly visited former Biogenesis employees and Bosch associates, even paying at least one $5,000 for information. \n \n Braun's name appears on at least two documents, one that lists him as owing $20,000 to $30,000 and another that says he owed $1,500 for what sources said were PEDs. Braun issued a statement saying the larger figure was to pay Bosch for consulting on his successful appeal of a 50-game suspension after he tested positive for elevated testosterone in October 2011, and Braun denied ever receiving or using PEDs. During his interview with ESPN, Bosch said he only consulted with Braun, but sources said he is expected to tell MLB he did provide the Milwaukee star with drugs. \n \n In the Brewers' locker room after Tuesday night's game, when informed about the ESPN report, Braun put aside questions on any link to Biogenesis. \n \n \"I've already addressed everything related to the Miami situation,\" Braun was quoted as saying by USA Today. \"I addressed it in spring training. I will not make any further statements about it. The truth has not changed. I don't know the specifics of the story that came out today, but I've already addressed it, I've already commented on it, and I'll say nothing further about it.\" \n \n Yankees manager Joe Girardi was asked about Rodriguez Wednesday and said that while he texts or calls him regularly to check on his rehab, he does not discuss PEDs. \n \n \"That's something that the union I think discusses clearly with the players, and they understand that, so that's handled through the union, I'm sure. But personally, I don't,\" Girardi said. \"Players are well-informed, that's the bottom line. You'd have to have your head buried in the sand to know that there are repercussions if you don't do things properly.\" \n \n MLBPA officials have negotiated with their MLB counterparts to offer limited cooperation from the players but have been concerned the players could expose themselves to further liability. \n \n Bosch's claims in his ESPN interview that he never distributed PEDs are sharply at odds with accounts from numerous sources who say he helped provide banned substances to possibly dozens of athletes. They also contradict paperwork that several sources said was handwritten by Bosch. Shown a list of athletes who allegedly received PEDs through Biogenesis, Bosch told ESPN's Pedro Gomez, \"No comment. I have never seen that in my life.\" The list was one of dozens of documents obtained by \"Outside the Lines\" and is similar to the documents in MLB's possession. \n \n Some paperwork, taken from company computers rather than Bosch's handwritten notes, lists players by code names. Most, such as Rodriguez, Colon, Cabrera and others, have been identified in media reports, but MLB will want Bosch to say who the code names represented.",

Andy Harris (R-Md.) complained loudly during freshmen orientation that his coverage wouldn't start immediately upon taking office. It took a new turn when Rep. Mike Kelly (R-Penn) and Bobby Schilling (R-Ill.) both said they would, in fact, forgo the coverage. It escalated even further when White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs called out Harris for the \"irony,\" and the municipal workers union AFSCME applied a similar charge to the whole GOP shortly thereafter. \n \n \"These Republicans want to repeal health reform, putting the insurance companies back in charge and putting affordable coverage out of reach of millions of Americans,\" said AFSCME President Gerald W. McEntee. \"If they enroll in the taxpayer-funded health care system provided to members of Congress, they deserve to be denounced as hypocrites.\" \n \n There is an apparent double standard with respect to lawmakers trying to reduce health care for American workers while taking a subsidy for health care for themselves. And in a Public Policy Poll released on Tuesday, a full 53 percent of respondents (and 58 percent of Republicans) said that if a congressman is opposed to the president's health care reform law, he or she should decline to participate in government-sponsored health care. \n \n But another cudgel sits there on the sidelines waiting to be used by trouble-making Democrats. If the incoming Republican Congress is so concerned about the use of taxpayer funds, it could start by foregoing taxpayer-funded health care. How much money that would save is impossible to pinpoint with great accuracy. But it's possible to make some reliable estimates. \n \n According to the Los Angeles Times, \"the plan most favored by federal workers is Blue Cross Blue Shield, which covers a family for about $1,030 a month.\" Of that total, \"taxpayers kick in $700.\" So far there are 242 Republicans set to be seated in the incoming House of Representatives (that could only go higher) and 47 Republicans in the Senate. The taxpayer bill for insuring all those members over the course of a single year comes to just over $2.4 million ($700 X 12 months X 289 members). \n \n Chump change? Yes, it is. That said, chump change seems to always at the heart of the most provocative political battles. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) made a big issue over the fact that $1 million was being appropriated for a Woodstock museum in upstate New York. \n \n UPDATE: Pete Sepp, the Executive Vice President of National Taxpayers Union -- one of the ultimate penny-pinching organizations in the D.C. area -- calls opting out of health care a \"symbolic and not insignificant\" gesture for congressional Republicans. \n \n \"If lawmakers are looking for ways to say that they feel solidarity with the American people this might be one way to do it,\" said Sepp. \"And, again, if you are looking at dollar amounts that's equivalent or a little more of equivalent to [congressmembers] taking a pay cut of about five percent. And, again, we have heard a lot of pledges to reduce the overall budget of Congress by ten percent. So opting out of health care coverage is one place to start.\" ||||| One of the country\u2019s largest labor unions has demanded Republican lawmakers skip congressional health insurance because the party voted against the health-care overhaul. \n \n The argument: If you don\u2019t support government health care, you shouldn\u2019t enroll in government health care, says the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. \n \n \u201cThese Republicans want to repeal health reform, putting the insurance companies back in charge and putting affordable coverage out of reach of millions of Americans,\u201d AFSCME President Gerald McEntee said in a statement. \n \n It\u2019s a bit more complicated than that. The debate over the health overhaul largely centered over how much Washington should get involved in health insurance for those employed in the private sector. \n \n Lawmakers, by contrast, take home a salary from the federal government. Most House members get $174,000 a year. \n \n \u201cThis has nothing to with ObamaCare,\u201d said Michael Steel, spokesman for presumptive House Speaker John Boehner (R., Ohio). \u201cBoehner, like Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi, Sen. [Harry] Reid and tens of millions of Americans, receives health coverage through his employer.\u201d \n \n Still, the issue has become a rallying cry for liberal activists after GOP Congressman-elect Andy Harris, a doctor from Maryland, complained he would have to wait four weeks until his new insurance took effect. The White House got involved this week when Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said Mr. Harris faces a \u201cparticularly interesting dilemma.\u201d \n \n Incoming GOP Rep. Bobby Schilling of Illinois said during his campaign he wouldn\u2019t take health insurance as a congressman in an effort to save taxpayers money. His son and spokesman, Terry Schilling, said the decision had nothing to do with the health-care law.",

Rapper Dave Murrell, who calls himself Fyrare and has paid Vidmar to log into his Twitter account and \"follow\" other people to boost his popularity on the social network, says he got the fake accounts after paying Vidmar to set up his own Twitter account and rebroadcast tweets on Fyrare's behalf. The problem, of course, is that these fake Twitter accounts aren't real. They're created by third-party vendors in countries like Pakistan, India, and China that don't offer Twitter support, the Journal notes. And the fake accounts can be hard to track down, since they're so often created by people who don't even own the actual Twitter accounts they're trying to pretend to use. \"It's like having your driver's license revoked,\" Vidmar tells the Journal. \"It's a lot harder than you think. It's a lot harder than you think. It's a lot harder than you think.\" (This fake Twitter account got hacked earlier this year.)",

It later became known as the Black Death. \n \n The plague The plague is one of the oldest identifiable diseases known to man \n \n Plague is spread from one rodent to another by fleas, and to humans either by the bite of infected fleas or when handling infected hosts \n \n Recent outbreaks have shown that plague may reappear in areas that have long been free of the disease \n \n Plague can be treated with antibiotics such as streptomycin and tetracycline \n \n Source: World Health Organization \n \n It arrived on Britain's shores in 1348 and is believed to have wiped out up to 60% of the population at the time. \n \n In London, two emergency burial grounds were dug outside the walls of the City. One has been found at East Smithfield, while the other is known to lie somewhere in Farringdon. \n \n In March 2013, Crossrail engineers uncovered 25 skeletons in a 5.5m-wide shaft - alongside pottery dated to the mid-14th Century. \n \n Samples from 12 of the corpses were taken for forensic analysis. In at least four cases, scientists found traces of the DNA of the Yersinia pestis, confirming they had contact with the plague prior to their death. \n \n To pinpoint which historical plague outbreak the \"Charterhouse 25\" could have fallen victim to, the researchers used radio carbon dating. \n \n They determined the burial ground was used in at least two distinct periods - the earliest within the Black Death in 1348-50, followed by a later outbreak in the 1430s. \n \n Image copyright Crossrail Image caption The bodies were found in a Crossrail shaft \n \n In a bid to understand just how far the grave extends across the square, Crossrail approached the University of Keele to undertake a forensic geophysics survey - using ground-penetrating radar. \n \n The initial scan detected signs of further burials across Charterhouse Square and also the foundations of a building - possibly a chapel. \n \n Image copyright crossrail Image caption Traces of plague bacteria were found in the teeth of the skeletons \n \n \"We will undertake further excavations in Charterhouse Square later this year to confirm some of the results,\" said Mr Carver. \n \n The skeletons provide a rare opportunity to study the medieval population of London, according to osteologist Don Walker, of the Museum of London Archaeology. \n \n He said: \"We can start to answer questions like: where did they come from and what were their lives like? \n \n \"I'm amazed how much you can learn about a person who died more than 600 years ago.\" \n \n Analysis of the skeletons' bones and teeth indicates that: \n \n Many of the skeletons appear to suffer signs of malnutrition and 16% had rickets. \n \n There is a high rate of back damage and strain indicating heavy manual labour. \n \n The later skeletons from the 1400s had a high rate of upper body injury consistent with being involved in violent altercations. \n \n 13 of the skeletons were male, three female, two children, the gender was undetermined in the other seven skeletons. \n \n 40% grew up outside London, possibly as far north as Scotland - showing that 14th Century London attracted people from across Britain just as it does today. \n \n Mr Carver said: \"We can see from the people here that Londoners weren't living an easy life. \n \n \"The combination of a poor diet and generally a struggle means they were very susceptible to the plague at that time and that's possibly one of the explanations for why the Black Death was so devastating.\" \n \n Image copyright Crossrail Image caption Archaeologist Jay Carver hopes to explore more of the burial site \n \n By sequencing the ancient bacterial DNA, researchers hope to understand how the plague has evolved and spread over the centuries. \n \n Globally the infection still kills 2,000 people a year, including countries like Madagascar.

(AP Photo/Lefteris Pitarakis) You can learn a lot from a tooth. Molars taken from skeletons unearthed by work on a new London railway line are revealing secrets of the medieval Black Death\u2014and of its victims. \n \n This week, Don Walker, an osteologist with the Museum of London, outlined the biography of one man whose ancient bones were found by construction workers under London's Charterhouse Square: He was breast-fed as a baby, moved to London from another part of England, had bad tooth decay in childhood, grew up to work as a laborer, and died in early adulthood from the bubonic plague that ravaged Europe in the 14th century. \n \n The poor man's life was nasty, brutish and short, but his afterlife is long and illuminating. \n \n \"It's fantastic we can look in such detail at an individual who died 600 years ago,\" Walker said. \"It's incredible, really.\" \n \n The 25 skeletons were uncovered last year during work on Crossrail, a new rail line that's boring 13 miles (21 kilometers) of tunnels under the heart of the city. Archaeologists immediately suspected the bones came from a cemetery for plague victims. The location, outside the walls of the medieval city, chimes with historical accounts. The square, once home to a monastery, is one of the few spots in the city to stay undisturbed for centuries. \n \n To test their theory, scientists took one tooth from each of 12 skeletons, then extracted DNA from the teeth. They announced Sunday that tests had found the presence of the plague bacterium, Yersinia pestis, in several of the teeth, meaning the individuals had been exposed to\u2014and likely died from\u2014the Black Death. \n \n The findings didn't stop there. Archaeologists, historians, microbiologists and physicists worked together to apply techniques from several scientific disciplines to the discovery. \n \n In this Wednesday, March 26, 2014 photo, Don Walker, a human osteologist with the Museum of London, poses for photographers, with one of the skeletons found by construction workers under central London's Charterhouse Square.

Forensic geophysics\u2014more commonly used in murder and war-crimes investigations\u2014helped locate more graves under the square. Studying oxygen and strontium isotopes in the bones revealed details of diet and health. \n \n These were, by and large, poor people. Many of the skeletons showed signs of malnutrition consistent with the \"Great Famine\" that struck Europe 30 years before the Black Death. Many had back injuries suggesting lives of hard labor. One man became a vegetarian late in life, indicating he may have entered an order of monks. \n \n Archaeologists were surprised to discover that the skeletons lay in layers and appeared to come from three different periods: the original Black Death epidemic in 1348-1350, and later outbreaks in 1361 and the early 15th century. \n \n In this Wednesday, March 26, 2014 photo, some of the skeletons found by construction workers under central London's Charterhouse Square are pictured.

As the plague ravaged continental Europe\u2014borne westward by fleas on rats\u2014city fathers leased land for an emergency burial ground. The burials were simple but orderly, the bodies wrapped in shrouds and laid out in neat rows, sealed with a layer of clay. \n \n The later skeletons, however, show more signs of upper-body injuries, consistent with a period of lawlessness and social breakdown. \n \n Archaeologists are planning a new dig this summer to learn how many bodies lie under the square.

Experts in ancient DNA at McMaster University in Canada are working to sequence the plague genome found in the teeth, in order to learn more about a disease that still infects several thousand people a year around the world. Most patients recover if treated early with antibiotics. \n \n Scientists want to know if the 14th-century disease is the same as the modern version, or whether the disease has evolved. Study of DNA from the teeth of skeletons discovered in the 1980s at another London plague cemetery suggested the bug was largely unchanged, but the scientific jury is still out. \n \n Brendan Wren, a professor of molecular biology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the new information could help scientists \"understand how the plague bacillus\u2014and other nasty bugs\u2014become so virulent to humans.\" \n \n \"It is useful information that could warn and avert potential epidemics and pandemics,\" he said. \n \n In this Wednesday, March 26, 2014 photo, Don Walker, a human osteologist with the Museum of London, poses for photographers, with one of the skeletons found by construction workers under central London's Charterhouse Square.

(Photo: Brian Powers/The Register)Buy Photo \n \n A former Iowa lottery security official accused of rigging drawings to win prize money in several states is facing new felony charges in Wisconsin. \n \n A prosecutor in the Wisconsin Department of Justice filed a total of six charges against Eddie Tipton on Thursday, including one count of racketeering, a theft by fraud charge and four computers crimes charges. The charges stem from a suspect December 2007 Megabucks drawing in Wisconsin that allegedly won Tipton and a business associate a prize worth $783,257, according to a criminal complaint. \n \n The fresh charges are the newest development in the ongoing legal saga involving Tipton, a former information security director for an Urbandale nonprofit group that distributes lottery games nationwide. Tipton, 53, was convicted of two fraud counts in Iowa last year after a prosecutor argued that he tampered with random number generators in 2010 to win a $14.3 million Hot Lotto prize. \n \n After the conviction, Iowa investigators linked Tipton, his brother and a longtime friend, Robert Rhodes, to suspect jackpots in Colorado, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Kansas and was charged with additional counts of ongoing criminal conduct and money laundering. That case is still pending. \n \n Defense attorney Dean Stowers has maintained Tipton's innocence since he was first arrested, and said Thursday he will voluntarily appear to answer the charges. Tipton's first case is being appealed to the Iowa Supreme Court after a lower appeals court in July tossed out one of the fraud convictions, ruling that it was filed it too late. \n \n \"What the States have claimed in these cases, as best we can understand, is not a crime under the various statutes they rely upon,\" Stowers said. \"The States basically have claimed that Mr. Tipton shared information about the way the computer programs that were tested and certified by third parties worked, and that does not appear to be a crime under the law of Iowa or Wisconsin.\" \n \n A 13-page criminal complaint filed in Dane County Circuit Court offers some of the most detailed allegations to date made public to date in the case about the role of Rhodes, a Texas businessman and friend who had known Tipton since the early 1990s. Rhodes is also facing charges in Iowa for allegedly helping Tipton in an ill-fated attempt to redeem the 2010 Hot Lotto ticket worth millions. \n \n MORE ON TIPTON:Iowa trial moved to February, out of Des Moines \n \n Rhodes offered his version of events in a meeting with Wisconsin and Iowa investigators in December 2015. According to the complaint, Rhodes claimed that Tipton first approached him about the possibility of rigging a lottery in October 2007. \n \n \"Tipton told Rhodes that there was a way that Tipton could give Rhodes winning lottery numbers and asked if they should take advantage of that,\" the complaint reads. \n \n In December 2007, Rhodes met with Tipton in Iowa, and the lottery security manager gave him several index cards filled with series of numbers, according to the complaint. Rhodes told investigators that Tipton instructed him to buy tickets for all of the numbers, ensuring him that one would work. Rhodes traveled to Wisconsin in a rental car, bought the tickets and learned when he got home that he had won a jackpot, according to the complaint. \n \n Rhodes set up a limited liability corporation to receive the earnings and split half with Tipton, according to the complaint. Tipton told his friend that the scheme was possible because he had programmed random number generators used by the Wisconsin lottery to come up with a predictable number if certain conditions were met. Tipton asked Rhodes again in 2010 if he wanted to try and win another Wisconsin prize, but the Texan felt the two were \"tempting fate,\" and he did not purchase a winning ticket. \n \n The criminal complaint also claims that Rhodes was shown the winning 2010 Iowa ticket in January or February of the next year while Tipton was visiting him in Houston. Rhodes was initially \"upset\" when Tipton asked him to claim the prize money, fearing that too many people were involved, according to the complaint. But they agreed to split the proceeds again. \n \n The criminal complaint also charges Rhodes with racketeering and theft by fraud. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2ila5VL ||||| \u00d7 Charged: 2 Texas men accused of defrauding Wisconsin Lottery \n \n MADISON \u2014 Eddie Tipton and Robert Rhodes, both of Texas, have been charged with multiple felonies for their alleged roles in defrauding the Wisconsin Lottery, Attorney General Brad Schimel announced on Friday, December 23rd. \n \n Tipton and Rhodes are both charged with Engaging in Racketeering Activities and Theft by Fraud. Tipton is also charged with four additional counts of Computer Crime. \n \n The complaint alleges that the two defendants conspired to win the December 29, 2007, Wisconsin Megabucks lottery game. Tipton, who was an employee of the Multi-State Lottery Association and responsible for programming the software used in the random number generator (RNG) machines used to pick the winning numbers, allegedly planted a modified code in the RNG software that produced a predictable set of winning numbers when certain conditions were met. Tipton allegedly supplied those numbers to Rhodes, who then purchased a ticket with the winning numbers. Rhodes later submitted the winning ticket for payment, and Rhodes and Tipton allegedly split the proceeds totaling $783,257.72. The complaint further alleges that three other Wisconsin Megabucks lottery drawings were manipulated by Tipton\u2019s modified code. \n \n Tipton will make his initial appearance on February 13, 2017, in Dane County Circuit Court.

The prime candidate for constructing it is perhaps Henry I sometime in the early 12th century,\u201d said one of Britain\u2019s leading experts on high status medieval buildings, Dr Edward Impey, Director-General of the Royal Armouries. \n \n It is the first time that archaeologists in Britain have ever found what is probably a previously unknown medieval royal palace of that size. Up until now historians have thought that the only royal residence at the site was a much smaller complex on top of a man-made castle mound. \n \n \u201cThis is a discovery of immense importance. It reveals the monumental scale of building work taking place in the earlier 12th century,\u201d said historian, Professor David Bates of the University of East Anglia, a leading authority on Norman England and author of the key modern study of the Norman world \u2013 The Normans and Empire. \n \n Because the city was largely abandoned up to 140 years after most of it had been built, and because it has remained a green field site ever since, it is giving academics a unique opportunity to study a Norman city. \n \n In pictures: 12 amazing archaeological discoveries 12 show all In pictures: 12 amazing archaeological discoveries 1/12 Ancient forest, discovered in February 2014 Ancient forest revealed by storms.

Our survey shows where individual buildings are located \u2013 and from this we can piece together a detailed picture of the urban plan within the city walls,\u201d said the archaeologist leading the geophysical survey, Kristian Strutt of the University of Southampton. \n \n The construction of the Norman city of Old Sarum - including a spectacular cathedral \u2013 was symbolic of a large-scale monumental building trend which was taking place around the country in the late 11th century. Bury St Edmunds, Norwich and Lincoln were all being massively expanded \u2013 and cathedrals were being built in Westminster, Winchester, Gloucester and York. In London the White Tower of the Tower of London was being constructed. \n \n However, by the early 13th century, the political and diocesan centre at Old Sarum was proving too cramped and exposed to the elements \u2013 and was therefore moved, lock, stock and barrel, to a totally new location, Salisbury, two and a half miles to the south. Even the masonry of the great Norman cathedral and other structures were transported and re-used to construct a new cathedral and other buildings in the newly established city of Salisbury. \n \n All that remained of Old Sarum, politically, was its right to send two MPs to Parliament \u2013 until, that is, the rotten boroughs were abolished with the passing of the Reform Act of 1832. Today the site, including the medieval castle and the visible foundations of the Norman cathedral, is in the care of English Heritage. \n \n Only now is geophysical survey work beginning to re-discover the long-vanished city \u2013 and what appears to have been its truly massive royal palace. ||||| Image copyright Environment Agency/University of Southampton Image caption The inner and outer baileys of the Old Sarum Iron Age fort were surveyed \n \n A detailed plan of a medieval city has been produced by experts without any digging at the site. \n \n The latest scanning techniques were used to uncover a network of buildings at the 11th Century Old Sarum near Salisbury, Wiltshire. \n \n The results include a series of large structures, possibly defences, with open areas of ground behind possibly for mustering resources or people. \n \n Old Sarum was the original site of Salisbury, which is two miles away. \n \n Image copyright English Heritage Image caption Old Sarum lies two miles north of the modern-day city of Salisbury, Wiltshire \n \n Image copyright University of Southampton Image caption Students from the University of Southampton spent the summer on site \n \n WHAT IS OLD SARUM? \n \n It was the location of the original Salisbury \n \n It combines a royal castle and cathedral within an Iron Age fortification \n \n Its ecclesiastical power waned during the 1220s when a new cathedral was built in New Sarum (present day Salisbury) \n \n Henry VIII ended the castle's use in 1514 \n \n The Romans, Normans and Saxons have all left their mark there \n \n For 150 years it was a major centre of government but its influence declined during the 13th Century as New Sarum flourished \n \n Source: English Heritage \n \n It was originally an Iron Age fort, established around 400 BC, and occupied by the Romans after the conquest of Britain in AD 43. \n \n This latest survey of the site was carried out by the University of Southampton and concentrated on the inner and outer baileys of what would have been the fort. \n \n It sets those monuments within the context of a bustling, vibrant town established shortly after the Norman conquest Neil Holbrook, Cotswold Archaeology \n \n Other structures plotted on the plan include residential areas and industrial features such as kilns or furnaces. \n \n The university's director of archaeological prospection services, Kristian Strutt, said: \"Archaeologists and historians have known for centuries that there was a medieval city at Old Sarum, but until now there has been no proper plan of the site. \n \n \"Our survey shows where individual buildings are located and from this we can piece together a detailed picture of the urban plan within the city walls.\" \n \n He said the reinforcing of the entire outer bailey during the Middle Ages represented a \"substantial urban centre\" and more non-intrusive work was needed to build on this knowledge. \n \n The techniques used to survey the land included magnetometry, earth resistance, ground penetrating radar and electric resistivity tomography, which uses electrodes to probe underground. \n \n These new approaches are \"exciting and innovative\", according to Neil Holbrook from Cotswold Archaeology, and \"could be applied pretty much anywhere\". \n \n \"The survey adds a whole new dimension to our understanding of a site which we thought we knew.

They concentrated their survey around the inner and outer baileys of what was once a fortification, with its origins in the Iron Age and the Roman conquest.1 \n \n \n \n Their investigations reveal the layout of a settlement including structures from the late 11th century, contemporary with the construction of a cathedral and castle. The city was inhabited for over 300 years, but declined in the 13th century with the rise of New Sarum (Salisbury). \n \n \n \n The project findings mainly concentrate on the medieval period and highlight: \n \n \n \n \u2022 A series of massive structures along the southern edge of the outer bailey defensive wall, perhaps suggesting large buildings of a defensive nature. \n \n \n \n \u2022 An open area of ground behind these large structures, perhaps for mustering resources or people, or as part of a circular route through the city. \n \n \n \n \u2022 Residential areas in the south east and south west quadrants of the outer bailey alongside the inner bailey ditch. \n \n \n \n \u2022 Evidence of deposits indicating industrial features, such as kilns or furnaces. \n \n \n \n \u2022 Features suggesting quarrying at the site after the 1300s and following the city\u2019s decline \u2013 indicating a later period of habitation at the site. \n \n \n \n \n \n Archaeologist Kristian Strutt, Experimental Officer and Director of Archaeological Prospection Services at the University of Southampton, says: \u201cArchaeologists and historians have known for centuries that there was a medieval city at Old Sarum, but until now there has been no proper plan of the site. \n \n \n \n \u201cOur survey shows where individual buildings are located and from this we can piece together a detailed picture of the urban plan within the city walls.\u201d \n \n \n \n The research was conducted as part of the Old Sarum and Stratford-Sub-Castle Archaeological Survey Project, directed by Kristian Strutt and fellow Southampton archaeologists Timothy Sly and Dominic Barker. Old Sarum is under the custodianship of English Heritage, who kindly granted permission for the investigation to take place. \n \n \n \n Heather Sebire, Property Curator at English Heritage, comments: \u201cHaving the team of archaeologists on site over the summer gave our visitors a chance to find out more about how important historic landscapes are surveyed. The use of modern, non-invasive surveying is a great start to further research at Old Sarum. \n \n \n \n \u201cFrom this work we can surmise much about the site\u2019s past and, whilst we can\u2019t conclusively date the findings, it adds a new layer to Old Sarum\u2019s story. We welcome the chance to find out more about our sites, and look forward to exploring ideas for further research in the future.\u201d \n \n \n \n The team used a variety of techniques to examine the outer and inner bailey of the site. These included the use of topographic survey methods and geophysical survey techniques \u2013 comprising of magnetometry, earth resistance, ground penetrating radar (GPR) and electric resistivity tomography (ERT) survey. \n \n \n \n Kristian Strutt concludes: \u201cOur research so far has shown how the entire outer bailey of the monument was heavily built up in the Middle Ages, representing a substantial urban centre. Results have given us compelling evidence as to the nature of some of the structures. It is clear, however, that there is more non-intrusive work that could be carried out to further expand our understanding of the site.\u201d \n \n \n \n The team hopes to return to complete the survey of the inner and outer baileys and survey the Romano-British settlement to the south of Old Sarum in Easter 2015. The project fieldwork in 2014 was used as a training season for undergraduate and postgraduate archaeology students at the University, continuing a long tradition of research-led teaching at some of the most impressive archaeological sites in the south of England. Previous fieldwork has been conducted by students at Portchester Castle, Netley Abbey and Bishop\u2019s Waltham Palace in Hampshire, and at Bodiam Castle in East Sussex. \n \n \n \n Ends \n \n \n \n Archaeology at Southampton \n \n Notes for editors",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A prehistoric fortress is home to a much later structure: what may be one of the biggest medieval palaces ever discovered, one whose remnants remain buried beneath the ground, the Independent reports. The site in southern England is surrounded by huge earthworks that date to the Iron Age. Researchers used ground-penetrating radar and other technology to investigate what's under the grass within the inner and outer baileys of the former fort, the BBC reports. Without doing any digging, they found a large complex that leading medieval-building expert Dr. Edward Impey believes is an early 12th-century castle. It measures about 560 feet by 210 feet and features 10-foot-thick walls and what appears to be a 200-foot-long great hall, the Independent notes. \"The prime candidate for constructing it is perhaps Henry I,\" says Impey. \"Archaeologists and historians have known for centuries that there was a medieval city at Old Sarum,\" notes survey leader Kristian Strutt, \"but until now there has been no proper plan of the site.\" The archaeologists' survey uncovered residential areas, evidence of kilns or furnaces, and an open area\u2014\"perhaps for mustering resources or people\"\u2014near some large structures, per a press release. \"From this we can piece together a detailed picture of the urban plan,\" says Strutt. The Iron Age fort at the site was likely built around 400 BC and taken over by Romans in 43 AD, the BBC notes. But by the onset of the 13th century, the city built in the same place became too tight and weather-beaten for habitation and was abandoned in favor of today's Salisbury, which is located roughly two miles away.

    "document": "This story appears in the December 12, 2017 issue of Forbes. Subscribe \n \n Anthony Kwan/Bloomberg \n \n Fresh off a tour through Thailand, Laos and China, United States Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross Jr. picked up the phone on a Sunday afternoon in October to discuss something deeply personal: how much money he has. A year earlier, Forbes had listed his net worth at $2.9 billion on The Forbes 400, a number Ross claimed was far too low: He maintained he was closer to $3.7 billion. Now, after examining the financial-disclosure forms he filed after his nomination to President Donald Trump's Cabinet, which showed less than $700 million in assets, Forbes was intent on removing him entirely. \n \n Ross protested, citing trusts for his family that he said he did not have to disclose in federal filings. \"You're apparently not counting those, which are more than $2 billion,\" he said. When asked for documentation, the 79-year-old demurred, citing \"privacy issues.\" Told that Forbes nonetheless planned to remove him from the list for the first time in 13 years, he responded: \"As long as you explain that the reason is that assets were put into trust, I'm fine with that.\" And when did he make the transfer that allowed him to not disclose over $2 billion? \"Between the election and the nomination.\" \n \n So began the mystery of Wilbur Ross' missing $2 billion. And after one month of digging, Forbes is confident it has found the answer: That money never existed. It seems clear that Ross lied to us, the latest in an apparent sequence of fibs, exaggerations, omissions, fabrications and whoppers that have been going on with Forbes since 2004. In addition to just padding his ego, Ross' machinations helped bolster his standing in a way that translated into business opportunities. And based on our interviews with ten former employees at Ross' private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., who all confirmed parts of the same story line, his penchant for misleading extended to colleagues and investors, resulting in millions of dollars in fines, tens of millions refunded to backers and numerous lawsuits. Additionally, according to six U.S. senators, Ross failed to initially mention 19 suits in response to a questionnaire during his confirmation process. \n \n Nearly a week before this article went to press, both Ross and his team at the Commerce Department were sent a detailed list of questions. \"Secretary Ross has filed all required disclosures in accordance with the law and in consultation with both legal counsel and ethics officials at the Department of Commerce and Office of Government Ethics. As we have said before, any misunderstanding from your previous conversation with Secretary Ross is unfortunate.\" They declined to provide further answers on the record. \n \n But Ross' questionable assertions to Forbes, combined with a recent controversy about a multimillion-dollar stake in a shipping company that does big business with close associates of Vladimir Putin, paint a clearer picture of the commerce secretary's tactics. His slippery statements during his confirmation hearings--\"I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of doubt\"--came as no surprise to those who have known Ross for decades. \n \n \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" says David Wax, who worked alongside Ross for 25 years and served as the No. 3 person in his firm. Another former colleague, who requested anonymity, was less circumspect: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" \n \n Listen to Wilbur Ross apparently lie to Forbes: \n \n Twenty-six years before Donald Trump was elected president of the United States, Wilbur Ross disappeared. It was 1990, corporate America was sick on junk bonds, and Ross was a top bankruptcy negotiator. But one November day, he failed to show up at an important meeting to brief bondholders in a furniture company's bankruptcy. They didn't know where he had gone. \n \n Until they went home and turned on the television. There was Ross, with Donald Trump, announcing a deal to recapitalize Trump's Taj Mahal casino, which was then careening toward bankruptcy. They were technically adversaries, with Ross representing one group of bondholders--at one point Trump asked them to fire Ross after he dismissed a Trump proposal to keep 100% of his equity, saying, \"It's too early for Christmas.\" But Ross eventually brokered a deal among Trump, debt holder Carl Icahn and Ross' own clients that allowed Trump to keep a 50% stake. \"I think [Ross] is very talented, a fantastic negotiator,\" Trump said at the time. \n \n The son of a judge, he always has been. He grew up in New Jersey, attended Yale and then Harvard Business School and eventually wound up as the bankruptcy work-out specialist at the investment bank Rothschild, where he was known for his ability to quickly distill complex situations. \"He was very, very sharp,\" says someone who worked with him back then. \"Very tough.\" By the early 1990s, his unit was bringing in around $18 million a year, with Ross personally pocketing more than a third of that. \n \n Ross was an extremely well-paid professional, but he yearned for the big money and big spotlight that come with having your own shop. \"People knew of him,\" says another former colleague, \"but not on his own.\" At first, he worked within Rothschild, raising $200 million for an internal private equity fund that would leverage his bankruptcy expertise to pick up companies on the cheap. Three years later, in 2000, he bought out the fund and slapped his name on the door. At 62, when most investment bankers start dabbling in golf and vineyards, Ross was poised to claim some glory for himself. Says Wax: \"He viewed it as an opportunity to have a pulpit, to name something after himself and to potentially make a lot of money.\" \n \n Ross quickly accomplished all three of those things. In 2002, his firm invested in the bankrupt steelmaker LTV. According to a Harvard Business School case study, LTV had put $1.2 billion into new plants and equipment but laid off 7,500 union employees and faced a $3.4 billion pension burden. As a master of work-outs, Ross knew he could get the federal government to take over the pensions. According to people who worked at the firm then, Ross told the unions he'd buy the business if they let him hire back just 3,500 workers. Figuring 3,500 jobs were better than none, the union agreed, and WL Ross picked up most of LTV's assets, without the pension headaches, for $135 million and about $165 million in annual environmental liabilities. \n \n Ross' timing was impeccable. One week later, President George W. Bush issued a stiff tariff on steel imports, sending U.S. prices soaring and making Ross look like a genius. He rolled up several more steel companies, including Bethlehem Steel, into International Steel Group, which filed for an IPO in 2003. \n \n Ross was technically the beneficial owner of nearly $1 billion worth of the stock. But most of that belonged to his investors, not Ross personally. In 2005, Indian billionaire Lakshmi Mittal bought the business for around $4.5 billion in cash and stock. \n \n Ross personally invested only about $3 million in his firm's first two funds, according to former employees. Buoyed by International Steel Group, he roughly tripled that money, but the bigger payout came from carried interest--the manager's cut of overall profits, typically 20%. In all, Ross made an estimated $260 million. \n \n A huge score, yes, though not nearly enough to be one of the 400 richest people in America. But when a Forbes reporter reached out to Ross, apparently crediting him with his investors' money, the future commerce secretary did nothing to clarify the situation, according to notes at the time. \n \n \"I just spoke to Ross,\" the reporter wrote. \"He's one of the easiest new guys I've put on [The Forbes 400] in a while. Very low-key, said he didn't really want to be on, but at the same time wasn't going to fight success. He says he doesn't want to juice up his numbers at all.\" \n \n \"I told him we're going to start him at $1 billion,\" added the reporter, who no longer works at Forbes . \"And he said 'Yep, fine, thank you.' \" \n \n Ross appeared on The Forbes 400 for the first time in 2004, with a net worth listed at $1 billion. It was nearly four times as much as he was likely worth. \"Everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" says a former colleague of Ross. A legend was born, and like most legends, this one had its roots in a myth. \n \n Within days of that fateful issue of Forbes, Ross married for the third time at a beachside church in Southampton, New York. His bride, Hilary, 12 years younger, had spent much of her life in the Hamptons and Palm Beach, two of the East Coast's most famous billionaire playgrounds. \"She brought him a certain kind of prominence, socially,\" says David Patrick Columbia, who publishes Hilary's musings on his website, New York Social Diary. \"It was a perfect merger.\" Adds another contemporary: \"She wants her husband to be on The Forbes 400.\" \n \n Life began to change for Ross. Once known for quirky suspenders, he now wore impeccable suits. A workaholic for most of his career, he began spending much of the year outside of New York. He started flying private, built up a collection of paintings by the Belgian artist Ren\u00e9 Magritte and bought a Palm Beach estate for $13 million. \n \n His fundraising kept pace with his spending. In 2005, he raised a $1.1 billion flagship fund, his largest yet. The next year, he sold WL Ross & Co. to the publicly traded investment-management company Invesco for $100 million up front and the ability to earn an additional $275 million, depending on how much money he was able to raise in later funds. \n \n With Invesco and a big incentive behind him, Ross raised a massive $4.1 billion fund in 2007, putting roughly $70 million of his own money into that one and the 2005 predecessor, according to three former employees. His net worth at this time was likely around $400 million, thanks to the sale of WL Ross & Co. But when contacted by Forbes that year, he gave valuations for his firm's investments as if the money belonged to him. The myth, with Forbes compounding it based on our original mistake and Ross' exhortations, got bigger. Now Forbes listed Ross with a net worth of $1.7 billion. \n \n That wasn't enough. \"I would say the total now is a bit more than $2 billion,\" Ross wrote in a 2011 email, according to notes taken at the time. In 2013, a different Forbes reporter realized that prior estimates seemed to include not just Ross' money but that of the investors in his funds. Ross strung us along, leading us to believe he would provide evidence of his assets, but never did. Just months later, he was insisting that he was even richer, and Forbes continued to largely fall for it. \"2.75 [billion] is a bit low but probably close enough,\" he wrote in an email around the start of 2014. In September, he was arguing for a valuation of $3.45 billion but begrudgingly accepted a smaller figure: \"3.1 [billion] is low, but I understand why you wish to be conservative.\" \n \n Why wouldn't Ross be satisfied with $400 million? \"You're talking about someone as egotistical as they come,\" Wax says. Five other former employees add a more tangible reason: The more money Ross appeared to be worth, the more money investors seemed willing to give him. \"Really, for us, it was a bet on him, \" says Sam Green, who helped put $300 million into Ross' funds on behalf of the Oregon Public Employees Retirement Fund, citing his personal wealth as one factor. \"I don't know of any better indicator of future success than having been successful in the past.\" Ross had seemed to figure out how to make fake numbers generate real assets. \n \n In 2010, Ross set out to raise a new private equity fund, hoping to come up with another $4 billion. It was an audacious goal in the wake of the financial crisis, far more than many of his partners thought would be possible. After two years of fundraising, Ross closed it with just $640 million of investments. Still, he told the media he had raised $2.2 billion. Technically true but also misleading. Most of the other $1.6 billion or so came from other funds or accounts that paid little or no fee to Invesco. Given that shareholders might assume that the firm had an extra $2.2 billion of assets generating fees for its private equity arm, which was not true, Invesco later clarified the matter on an earnings call. \n \n There were also charges related to transparency inside the funds. In August 2016, the SEC announced a settlement with Invesco-owned WL Ross after investigating whether the firm had charged its investors improper fees from 2001 to 2011. WL Ross agreed to pay a $2.3 million fine, without admitting or denying the findings of the investigation. It also agreed to refund $11.8 million to investors. And that was small potatoes: Buried in its 2015 annual report, Invesco disclosed that it had paid an additional $43 million in reimbursements and regulatory expenses associated with its private equity business in the previous two years. The filings don't explicitly connect that money to WL Ross--and these payments have never before been reported--but four former employees said they were all tied to Wilbur Ross' firm. Invesco declined to comment for this story. \n \n In 2012, Ross' longtime No. 2, David Storper, left the firm but said he retained interests in many of the funds. Three years later, Storper alleged in a lawsuit that the firm sent him inaccurate financial information after his departure and that Wilbur Ross stole his interests outright. Ross denied the allegations, and the lawsuit remains ongoing. A few years earlier, a vice chairman of WL Ross sued Wilbur Ross for more than $20 million, alleging that Ross tried to cut him out of interest and fees he had been promised. The parties had reached a settlement by 2007, which former employees say cost about $10 million. \n \n The Storper case has other ex-employees looking back to be sure they were sent proper information. Joseph Mullin, a former member of WL Ross' 15-person investment team, filed his own suit against WL Ross & Co., also alleging that Ross took his interests after he left. The firm filed a motion to dismiss in February, but the case remains active. A third ex-colleague, who is not in litigation, argues that Ross' tactics went beyond hard-nosed negotiating: \"Everybody does some cheating, everybody does some lying. Not everybody steals from their employees.\" \n \n On November 8, 2016, the night that upended American politics, Wilbur Ross was with Donald Trump, his family and top backers in New York City. The relationships inside this inner sanctum ran deep. Billionaire Phillip Ruffin, the president's Las Vegas partner who had Trump serve as best man at his wedding, was there. So was Icahn and apparently Richard LeFrak, the real estate tycoon who was part of the Palm Beach circle that included Trump and Ross. \n \n But Ross was the only one who left his day job to join Trump in government. \"I'd rather hang myself,\" Ruffin told Forbes earlier this year. \"I don't know why Wilbur took it.\" \n \n But viewed in the context of Ross' career arc, it makes perfect sense. The steel deal made him rich, but his returns have been mediocre since, so much so that WL Ross filed documents to raise a sixth flagship fund last year, but nothing seemed to come of it. Trump, the guy he kept afloat 26 years before, offered his fellow attention-seeking dealmaker a lifeline to relevance. \n \n Ross' appointment as secretary of commerce came with one catch: He had to disclose his assets, providing evidence that he was not as rich as he had long claimed. In 2015, he sent Forbes a detailed breakdown of his supposed holdings, listing $1.25 billion in partnership interests, $1.1 billion in municipal bonds, $500 million in equities, $200 million in art, $110 million in real estate and $200 million in cash, for a fanciful total of $3.4 billion, according to notes taken at the time. We eventually listed him at $2.9 billion. Last year, Ross' assistant claimed $3.7 billion; we stuck with $2.9 billion. \n \n His former colleagues saw the moment of reckoning coming as soon as he accepted a Cabinet role. \"It was surprising because he would have to reveal to the world that he wasn't a billionaire,\" one ex-employee said. \"I was surprised that he would take that risk.\" \n \n But Ross was ready to double down, even while he was a Cabinet member, telling Forbes about the putative $2 billion asset transfer to his family members after the election. That opened up a storm of questions from ethics and tax experts. If Ross had owned $2 billion of additional assets before the election, wouldn't they have produced income that he was required to disclose, even if he no longer owned the assets? And why would someone apparently transfer $2 billion to his family, thereby triggering more than $800 million in gift taxes, especially with a president in the White House who was prepared to eliminate the estate tax and therefore much of the cost of transferring fortunes to later generations? \n \n \"I am aware of the ethics and tax rules and have complied with all of them,\" Ross wrote in an October email to Forbes . \"Aren't you going a bit overboard on this? I have explained my situation to you and am surprised and disappointed by the seemingly accusatory tone of your email. For more than 50 years I have had a good relationship with your publication and with the Forbes family. And never have had a bad experience with either. In fact I was just the featured speaker at your magazine's hundredth anniversary CEO conference in Hong Kong.\" \n \n After Forbes published an online story on October 16 laying out those questions, six Senate Democrats wrote a letter to the top ethics official in the federal government, asking him to figure out what was going on with Ross' finances. \"It is imperative that Congress and the Office of Government Ethics know the full extent of Mr. Ross's holdings to ensure he is not putting personal gain ahead of the interests of the American people.\" \n \n The Department of Commerce issued a statement saying the $2 billion gift never happened. \"Contrary to the report in Forbes, there was no major asset transfer to a trust in the period between the election and Secretary Ross's confirmation.\" \n \n The only problem with that statement: The person who told Forbes that the transfer had taken place, that it had happened after the election and that it had meant more than $2 billion of family assets weren't on the disclosure was none other than the sitting secretary of commerce, Wilbur Ross. ||||| Defending his appointment of a billionaire to promote the country\u2019s economic growth, Donald Trump has said that he does not want poor people to hold economic roles in his administration. \n \n Speaking at a rally in Iowa, the President declared: \u201cSomebody said why did you appoint a rich person to be in charge of the economy?

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Earlier this year, President Trump noted \"I just don't want a poor person\" in charge of economic posts in his administration, then touted Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as \"a very rich person\" who was up to the task. But just how rich Ross really is is now up in the air, Forbes reports, noting it's yanked Ross off its billionaires list after a one-month probe revealed that $2 billion or so or Ross' alleged fortune \"never existed,\" and that Ross had engaged in an \"apparent sequence of fibs, exaggerations, omissions, fabrications, and whoppers\" with the magazine going back 13 years. The discovery came when Ross, 79, contacted Forbes in October to refute his ranking: Last year he was listed with a net worth of $2.9 billion on the Forbes 400; he claimed he was worth closer to $3.7 billion. Then Forbes talked with 10 of Ross' ex-employees at his private equity firm, who noted a \"penchant for misleading\" that affected fellow workers and investors and spurred big fines, suits, and refunds to backers. \"Wilbur doesn't have an issue with bending the truth,\" one longtime colleague says, while another is more blunt: \"He's lied to a lot of people.\" The magazine delves into Ross' back story, including how, when he first made the Forbes billionaires list in 2004 with a net worth of $1 billion, \"everyone that I knew that worked with Wilbur knew it wasn't true,\" per a former colleague. When Forbes told Ross he was being removed from its billionaires club, Ross retorted the magazine wasn't counting family trusts that he wasn't obligated to inform the feds about\u2014in the amount of \"more than $2 billion,\" assets Ross said he put into the trusts sometime \"between the election and [my] nomination.\" When Forbes asked to see a paper trail proving that, Ross cited \"privacy issues\"\u2014and the magazine lays out other problems with Ross' story on the supposed $2 billion transfer.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 \"I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal and any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of doubt\u2014came as no surprise to those who have known Ross for decades,\" Bloomberg quotes Wilbur Ross Jr. as saying during his confirmation hearings to be commerce secretary. The Commerce secretary's remarks were in response to a question about whether he would recuse himself from matters involving his private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., which has done business with companies owned by Vladimir Putin's son-in-law. During his confirmation hearing, Ross said he would recuse himself from matters involving the shipping company because his own firm had done business with it. But Bloomberg reports Ross didn't mention that his firm had done business with shipping company Evergreen Lines, which is owned by Putin's son-in-law, Dmitry Rogozin. In fact, Evergreen Lines was sued 19 times by Ross' private equity firm, WL Ross & Co., for alleged violations of anti-money-laundering laws, according to Bloomberg's timeline of events. Ross' firm was also sued by Evergreen for allegedly violating anti-money-laundering laws by failing to disclose that it had done business with a company owned by the son-in-law of Russian President Vladimir Putin. In a statement to Bloomberg, WL Ross & Co. says it \"vigorously disputes\" the allegations and \"vigorously contests\" them \"to the fullest extent of the law.\" It adds: \"Secretary Ross has filed all required financial disclosures with the Office of Government Ethics and has filed all required disclosure forms with the Office of Government Ethics.\" Forbes has been investigating Ross since he was nominated to become commerce secretary.",

Each episode will be available to stream the following day at pbs.org/nature and on PBS apps. \n \n Stalking in the shadows, prowling almost every continent, cats are one of the world\u2019s most diverse and successful predators. But there is far more to these charismatic and misunderstood animals than most people recognize. Filmed over 600 days in 14 countries and featuring 31 species of cat, this groundbreaking three-part miniseries narrated by F. Murray Abraham uncovers the secret lives of big cats and introduces behaviors captured on film for the first time, using the latest camera technology and scientific research. \n \n From the solitary bachelor snow leopard in the Himalayas to the elusive swamp tiger of South Asia, to a remarkably efficient Californian bobcat that is blind in one eye, Super Cats, A Nature Miniseries reveals how cats survive and thrive in all four corners of the globe. Nature uncovers their social sides, their complex communication, devoted parental care, courtship rituals, hunting patterns and more. \n \n Advances in technology allowed for several on-camera firsts, including the nocturnal pursuits of a tiny but deadly black-footed cat in South Africa who hunts more in one night than a leopard does in six months. Remote cameras capture exclusive intimate moments between a mother Pallas\u2019 cat and her kittens. Low-light technology exposes a true rarity: a puma preying on Magellanic penguins, one of the few successful hunts ever caught on film. A swamp tiger takes a bath in the sea \u2014 a phenomenon previously unseen on television. \n \n Production Credits: Episode 3 - Science and Secrets Print Narrated by \n \n F.

It's a wee cat that you've probably never heard of: Africa's smallest feline, the black-footed cat. \n \n Native to the grasslands of southern Africa, the black-footed cat has an endearingly round face and a light brown, black-spotted body that is small even compared to domestic cats. The wild feline measures only 14 to 20 inches (36 to 52 centimeters) long, stands about 8 inches (20 cm) tall and weighs about 2 to 6 lbs. (1 to 3 kilograms), according to the International Society for Endangered Cats (black-footed cats are listed as \"vulnerable\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature). \n \n Admittedly, those measurements don't sound very impressive when compared to the sizable big cats that are among the world's most fearsome predators. But despite its small size, the black-footed cat hunts and brings down more prey in a single night than a leopard does in six months, according to the PBS Nature miniseries \"Super Cats.\" [Meet the Rare and Fabulous Felines of 'Super Cats' (Photos)] \n \n The second episode in the miniseries aired on PBS last night (Oct. 31). It featured an unprecedented glimpse of the black-footed cat, along with views of other fascinating and elusive wild felines, such as a pregnant jaguar in Costa Rica, a rare swamp tiger in India and a family of fishing cats \u2014 the only semiaquatic cats \u2014 in the wetlands of Asia. \n \n For the latest episode, titled \"Cats in Every Corner,\" filmmakers captured never-before-seen views of black-footed cats by collaborating with researcher Alexander Sliwa, a curator at the Cologne Zoo in Germany who has studied the black-footed cat since the 1990s. Through Sliwa, the series' makers gained access to several small cats that had already been fitted with radio collars at a study site in South Africa, \"Super Cats\" producer Gavin Boyland told Live Science. \n \n Filming the tiny cats proved unusually challenging, Boyland said. Because the black-footed cats are so small, they're harder to track through tall grasses than big cats are. Since the little cats hunt mostly at night, the production crew needed to use a special light-sensitive camera to detect the felines at all, recording footage of hunting behavior that had never been captured before, Boyland explained. \n \n And when it comes to hunting, as the filmmakers saw, the black-footed cat is extraordinarily efficient \u2014 \"a real powerhouse,\" said Luke Hunter, Chief Conservation Officer at Panthera, a global wildcat-conservation organization. \n \n Hunter, who served as a scientific consultant for \"Super Cats,\" explained that small predators like the black-footed cat have accelerated metabolisms, which they need to keep fueled all the time, \"so they're constantly hunting,\" he said. \n \n Black-footed cats are found only in three countries: Botswana, Namibia and South Africa. Credit: Copyright Alexander Sliwa \n \n Black-footed cats use three very different techniques to nab their prey. One method is known as \"fast hunting,\" in which the cats bound quickly and \"almost randomly\" through the tall grass, flushing out small prey such as birds or rodents, Hunter said. Another of their methods takes them on a slower course through their habitat, with the cats weaving quietly and carefully to sneak up on potential prey. \n \n Finally, they use a sit-and-wait approach near rodents' burrows, a technique called still hunting, Hunter said. \n \n \"They wait for up to 2 hours, [staying] absolutely immobile, just silently waiting at the burrow for a rodent to appear. And then they nab it,\" Hunter told Live Science. \n \n In one night, a black-footed cat kills between 10 and 14 rodents or small birds, averaging a kill about every 50 minutes, according to Hunter. With a 60 percent success rate, black-footed cats are about three times as successful as lions, which average a successful kill about 20 to 25 percent of the time, Hunter said. \n \n \"If you're a gazelle or a wildebeest, a black-footed cat isn't at all deadly. But those success rates make them the deadliest little cat on Earth,\" he said. \n \n Livestock grazing reduces the habitats of black-footed cats, which hunt birds, rodents and even insects that inhabit grassland ecosystems. Credit: Copyright Alexander Sliwa \n \n Black-footed cats represent but one species in a highly diverse feline family, many of which are difficult to observe in the wild and are not well-understood. And though most of the felines that appear in \"Super Cats\" face serious threats of habitat loss and destruction from human activity, conservation efforts can yet preserve vulnerable populations, Hunter said. \n \n \"I believe it's mostly not doom and gloom. But if we don't actively conserve these species, if we don't work to reduce those threats, then we could lose some of these animals,\" he added. \n \n Episode 2 of \"Super Cats\" is available to stream beginning today (Nov. 1). You can also watch Episode 1 \u2014 \"Extreme Lives\" \u2014 and learn more about the miniseries on the PBS Nature website and on PBS apps.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The world's deadliest cat is no leopard or tiger\u2014in fact, it's the size of a house cat and appears just as cuddly. But the black-footed cat of southern Africa can hunt the grasslands like no other, Live Science reports. The PBS series Super Cats follows them on nightly forays, showing how they hunt and explaining why they kill more prey in a night than a leopard does in half a year. German zoo curator Luke Hunter helped by fitting several black-footed cats with radio collars, enabling the crew to track them in tall grasses. \"If you're a gazelle or a wildebeest, a black-footed cat isn't at all deadly,\" says Hunter, who has studied the cats since the 1990s. \"But those success rates make them the deadliest little cat on Earth.\" And the black-footed cat has tricks. It can hunt by bounding randomly through grass, sneaking up on prey in a weaving pattern, or waiting patiently by burrows for a meal to emerge. They can \"wait for up to 2 hours, absolutely immobile, just silently waiting at the burrow for a rodent to appear,\" Hunter says. \"And then they nab it.\" They kill 10 to 14 small birds and rodents nightly, or about one every 50 minutes\u2014a constant hunt necessary to supply their active metabolisms. Like most felines in the series, the black-footed cat is endangered, but Hunter accentuates the positive: \"I believe it's mostly not doom and gloom,\" he says, but \"if we don't work to reduce those threats, then we could lose some of these animals.\" See the episode at PBS.

He later got a 75-cent charge for the paper on his bill. In suing Hilton, he accused the hotel chain of hiding the fee in an \"extremely small font which is difficult to notice or read\" on the envelope the hotel room key goes into. \n \n According to the suit, \"The alleged consumer injury is substantial, causing millions of guests at defendant's hotels to unwittingly part with money for a newspaper they did not request and reasonably believed was provided to them without charge.\" \n \n It's over a piddly sum, but the case could have big implications if it becomes the impetus to sue other hotel chains, since many hotels do just the same thing. \n \n Hilton guest makes federal case of 75-cent paper [SF Gate] (Thanks to Paul!) \n \n From ConsumerReports.org: ||||| A California man is suing the Hilton Hotels Corporation for charging him 75 cents for a copy of the USA Today newspaper that he did not request, according to a complaint filed last week in federal court in San Francisco. \n \n The man, Rodney Harmon of Sacramento County, spent the night of March 28 in the Hilton Garden Inn Sonoma County Airport. When he left his room the next morning, he saw a copy of USA Today on the floor in front of his door, the familiar, bright blue logo peering up at him. But Mr. Harmon, 55, was not interested. He stepped over the paper and walked away. \n \n Several days later, according to his lawyer, Kirk J. Wolden, Mr. Harmon glanced at the Hilton Garden Inn pouch that held his key card and found that it said, in small print, that he would be charged for the paper unless he specifically un-requested it. \n \n So he sued. \n \n \u201cMr. Harmon and this law firm believe there is more at stake than 75 cents,\u201d Mr. Wolden said Monday. \u201cIt exemplifies the types of advantages that, unfortunately, we see companies taking of you and I and everyone else every day.\u201d \n \n He added, \u201cWe as individuals are expected to make an honest dollar.\u201d \n \n A spokesman for Hilton did not immediately respond for a request for comment Monday night. \n \n The complaint asserts that the practice is not only deceitful, but also wasteful and damaging to the environment. \n \n Would another publication have elicited a more positive response from Mr. Harmon? A San Francisco Chronicle, or perhaps a copy of Consumer Reports? \n \n Mr. Wolden said he did not believe so. ||||| A guest at a Hilton hotel in Santa Rosa who was upset that he was billed 75 cents for a newspaper he assumed was free has filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the hotel chain, saying he was deceived by a scheme that also hurts the environment. \n \n Rodney Harmon, 55, of Sacramento said he visited the Hilton Garden Inn Sonoma County Airport on March 28 and saw a copy of USA Today outside his door. \n \n \"He did not request a newspaper and assumed it had been placed there by hotel staff,\" said the suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in San Francisco. Harmon didn't realize until later that a 75-cent charge for the paper had been added to his bill. \n \n Harmon accused Hilton of deliberately hiding the newspaper charge by describing the fee in an \"extremely small font which is difficult to notice or read\" on the sleeve of the room card. \n \n The suit noted that newspaper readership and circulation has drastically declined over the past several decades and that most hotel guests probably aren't reading the paper anyway. The wasted papers are an \"offensive waste of precious resources and energy,\" said the suit, which also said that \"deforestation caused by paper production is a matter of concern and worry in this state, country and worldwide.\" \n \n \"Certainly if people who don't want newspapers are getting newspapers and then not using them, that is waste that we don't need,\" Kirk Wolden, an attorney representing Harmon, said Friday, \n \n \"The alleged consumer injury is substantial, causing millions of guests at defendant's hotels to unwittingly part with money for a newspaper they did not request and reasonably believed was provided to them without charge,\" the suit says. \n \n Hilton officials declined comment, citing the pending litigation. \n \n This article appeared on page C - 2 of the San Francisco Chronicle",

    "document": "It might have been something as simple as a portion of white asparagus. Peeled, steamed and served with a delicious sauce, as Germans traditionally eat it. And with real butter, a scarcity in wartime. While the rest of the country struggled to get even coffee, or had to spread margarine diluted with flour on their bread, Margot W\u00f6lk could have savored the expensive vegetable dish -- if not for the fear of dying, that is. W\u00f6lk was one of 15 young women who were forced to taste Nazi leader Adolf Hitler's food for some two and a half years during World War II. \n \n The 24-year-old secretary had fled from her parents' bombed-out Berlin apartment in the winter of 1941, traveling to her mother-in-law's home in the East Prussian village of Gross-Partsch, now Parcz, Poland. It was an idyllic, green setting, and she lived in a house with a large garden. But less than three kilometers (1.9 miles) away was the location that Hitler had chosen for his Eastern Front headquarters -- the Wolf's Lair. \n \n \"The mayor of the little nest was an old Nazi,\" says W\u00f6lk. \"I'd hardly arrived when the SS showed up at the door and demanded, 'Come with us!'\" \n \n Sitting in the same apartment in Berlin's Schmargendorf area where she was born 95 years ago, she carefully eats tiny pieces of crumb cake from a silver fork. \"Delicious,\" she says. W\u00f6lk has learned to enjoy food again, but it wasn't easy. \n \n Hitler's thugs brought her and the other young women to barracks in nearby Krausendorf, where cooks prepared the food for the Wolf's Lair in a two-story building. The service personnel filled platters with vegetables, sauces, noodle dishes and exotic fruits, placing them in a room with a large wooden table, where the food had to be tasted. \"There was never meat because Hitler was a vegetarian,\" W\u00f6lk recalls. \"The food was good -- very good. But we couldn't enjoy it.\" \n \n Trapped at the Wolf's Lair \n \n There were rumors that the Allies had plans to poison Hitler. After the women confirmed that the food was safe, members of the SS brought it to the main headquarters in crates. Each morning at 8 a.m., W\u00f6lk was rousted from bed by the SS, who shouted \"Margot, get up!\" from beneath her window. She was only needed if Hitler was actually at the Wolf's Lair, though she never actually saw him. \n \n Thus a young woman who had refused to join the League of German Girls (BDM), the girl's version of Hitler Youth, and whose father had been hauled off for refusing to join the Nazi party, became Hitler's helper. Each day, her life was on the line for a man she deeply despised. \n \n Flight, however, was not an option. Allied bombs had damaged her Schmargendorf apartment, which stood in knee-deep water. Her husband Karl was at war, though having heard nothing from him in two years, she had long since assumed he was dead. \"Where was I supposed to go?\" she asks. At least in Gross-Partsch she had her mother-in-law and her own bed. \n \n Then July 20, 1944 arrived. A few soldiers had invited women from the area to a film showing in a tent near the headquarters, when Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg's bomb exploded. \"The explosion ripped us off the wooden benches,\" W\u00f6lk says. Then someone yelled, \"Hitler is dead!\" But the assassination plot had failed. \"He walked away with a few bruises,\" W\u00f6lk says dryly. \n \n After that, the Nazis tightened security around the Wolf's Lair, and the tasters were no longer allowed to live at home. Instead, they were boarded in an empty school nearby. \"We were guarded like caged animals,\" W\u00f6lk says. \n \n Escape to Berlin \n \n Then one night an SS officer used a ladder to get into the room where she was sleeping and raped her. She says that she remained silent during the attack. \"The old pig,\" W\u00f6lk says, adding that she had never felt so helpless. \"The next morning the ladder was still lying in front of the building.\" She remains quiet and matter-of-fact, saying it's important to her that her story be taken seriously. \n \n When the Soviet army was just a few kilometers away from reaching the Wolf's Lair, a lieutenant took her aside and told her, \"Go, get out of here!\" He put her on a train to Berlin, and it saved her life. After the war she saw him again there, and he told her that all of the other food tasters had been shot by Soviet soldiers. \n \n Her life was saved a second time by a Berlin doctor who took her in after she fled the Wolf's Lair. When SS soldiers showed up at his practice searching for the fugitive, he lied to them and they left. \n \n As she returned to Schmargendorf, however, she fell into the hands of the Soviet army. For two weeks, they raped her repeatedly, inflicting such brutal injuries that she was never able to bear children. She pauses at the painful memory. \"I was so desperate,\" the 95-year-old whispers. \"I didn't want to live anymore.\" \n \n A Survival Trick \n \n It wasn't until she was reunited with her husband Karl in 1946 that she began to have hope again, W\u00f6lk says. He was marked by years of war and imprisonment, but she nursed him back to health, and the couple spent another 34 happy years together. \n \n W\u00f6lk smiles when she thinks of her husband. After all of her experiences, she is not a bitter woman. Quite the contrary, in fact. She's dressed up in a royal blue sweater and a necklace of wooden beads. She's also put on makeup, or \"painted herself,\" as she calls it. Despite the past, she says she has always tried to be happy. \"I didn't lose my humor,\" she says. \"Though it got more sarcastic.\" \n \n Instead, she decided not to take it all too seriously. \"That was always my trick to survival,\" she says. \n \n But for a long time, W\u00f6lk didn't want to even think about what happened in Gross-Partsch, much less discuss it. The experience came to her often in dreams, however. It wasn't until this winter, when a local journalist paid her a visit for her 95th birthday and began asking questions, that she spoke about what she calls the worst years of her life. At that moment, she suddenly decided to break her silence. \"I just wanted to say what happened there,\" she says. \"That Hitler was a really repugnant man. And a pig.\" \n \n This article originally appeared in German on einestages.de, SPIEGEL ONLINE's history portal. ||||| RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A farm purchased by a Richmond department store owner during World War II to shelter Jews escaping Nazi Germany has been added to the Virginia Landmarks Register. \n \n The listing of Hyde Park in Nottoway County is among 13 additions to the register by the state Department of Historic Resources. Others include historic districts in five towns, a New Deal-era elementary school in northern Virginia and houses and homesteads dating back centuries. \n \n Department store owner William B.
