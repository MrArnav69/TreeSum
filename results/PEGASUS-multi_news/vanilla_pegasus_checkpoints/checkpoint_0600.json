    "document": "A mental adventure familiar to most students is that of cramming one\u2019s mind with knowledge in the run up to an exam. Once the exam is done, we gleefully evacuate our brain of all this hard-won learning that\u2019s no longer needed. Within days, we can barely remember the subject matter, let alone the details. At such moments, it\u2019s as if we\u2019ve forgotten on purpose. \n \n It might then come as a surprise to learn that until recently, there was little scientific evidence that people could have any deliberate influence on their rates of forgetting. But in the last few years, a small family of experimental techniques have showed that, under the right conditions, we can in fact deliberately forget things. The effects are subtle, but nonetheless suggestive: being able to forget at will would, after all, be a killer life skill. \n \n But how does deliberate forgetting work? An exciting new study sheds light on the question. \n \n Jeremy Manning and Kenneth Norman have been doing wonderful work on memory for years, and in a remarkably cunning experiment, they provide evidence that we forget things by discarding the mental context within which those memories were first learned. \n \n Sticky brain or memory like a sieve? | Ben Ambridge Read more \n \n The study is a sophisticated one, and it\u2019s worth reading the original here (methods sections are always the best bit, FYI). But in essence, they instructed people to deliberately remember or forget words they\u2019d just learned. And they then spied on the brain to see what happened next. \n \n What they observed is that the brain that attempts to remember keeps active the mental context that was present during the learning \u2013 whereas the brain that tries to forget discards that context, letting go of the mental scaffolding that had (probably) supported the construction of those memories in the first place. \n \n That context is the key to forgetting is striking, and makes intuitive sense, since it\u2019s also the key to remembering. The most powerful memory technique of all is the \u201cmemory palace\u201d, which is precisely an instrument that exploits the powers of spatial context to enhance memory. By imagining objects around sequences of locations (contexts), we can then recall those memories by visiting those contexts. \n \n In more familiar territory, a fundamental rule of hosting a good party is to make sure the event transitions through several rooms or locations. Parties that unfurl all in the same space become a mess of disorganised memory; by contrast, when a party transitions through a series of differentiated contexts, such variety is soon reflected in memory, and one can recall precisely what one experienced in each location, enjoying each moment for its own recollected merits. \n \n And of course, the quality of an experience correlates almost exactly with how well it sits in memory. Our most magical and meaningful experiences tend to include lots of doubt and suffering at the time. But such vulgar details dim in memory, and when the golden burst of meaning and friendship at the top of the tiring mountain path, for instance, is all that remains of a remembered adventure, we know that it was a wonderful time. \n \n Too many neurons spoil the memory Read more \n \n It\u2019s sometimes said that we live in an age that doesn\u2019t value memory, which would seem to be rather worrying in light of the vital role of memory in meaning. I don\u2019t completely agree with this concern (the world\u2019s never been more memorable), but this study on the importance of context in remembering and forgetting can attune us to at least one way in which we might do better with our experience. \n \n \n \n Consider how we now tend to photograph the most important moments in our lives rather than just drinking them in. When we do this, we diminish our first-hand experience, confident that by having stored (and perhaps shared) a photo, we\u2019ve logged the moment. That leaves us much less likely to directly remember the original experience, allowing the photo to do our remembering for us. \n \n The result is that our lives become ever more biased in favour of the visual and the shareable. Vision is the most dispassionate, the least emotional, of all the modalities, and what we share inevitably biases our recollections towards moments where we seemed beautiful and happy, as opposed to those when we actually were. So our recollected lives become thinner, and less truthful. \n \n This mode of living is what the late Doris McIlwain called Living Palely, and I highly recommend reading her call for us to rationally embrace irrational emotion in order to live, and remember, fully. \n \n Perhaps, one day, we will all be able to remember at will the best parts of life and forget the parts that hold us back. There are techniques at our disposal to help us do both. But they require more than just changing the way we relate to our memories \u2013 they require us to tweak the way we live. And that is no small feat. ||||| Photo \n \n The leaders of the independent commission that investigated the 9/11 attacks, former Governor Tom Kean of New Jersey and former Representative Lee Hamilton of Indiana, carried out that highly sensitive task with integrity and rigor. \n \n Now they are weighing in again as the Obama administration prepares to make public at least some of the 28 pages from a separate, earlier investigation by a congressional panel that examined possible Saudi government involvement in the attacks. The pages have been kept secret since 2002. \n \n In a statement issued last Friday, Mr. Kean, the commission chairman, and Mr. Hamilton, the vice chairman, effectively delivered this bottom line to Americans: Be cautious in judging the material when it becomes available. \n \n Former Senator Bob Graham, who was a co-chairman of the separate 2002 joint congressional inquiry into the attacks, has long claimed there is evidence of complicity by institutions and people in Saudi Arabia beyond the 15 Saudi nationals who were among the 19 Al Qaeda terrorists. Such allegations are adding new tensions to an already fraught Saudi-American relationship. \n \n But Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Kean stress that, unlike their commission, the congressional panel never had a chance to investigate any of the leads contained in the 28 pages. Those pages were based mostly on raw, unvetted material from the F.B.I. and \u201ctherefore, are comparable to preliminary law enforcement notes, which are generally covered by grand jury secrecy rules. Those rules exist to avoid implicating people in serious crimes without the benefit of follow-up investigation to determine if such suspicions are substantiated,\u201d they wrote. \n \n The two men said they consider this point crucial since the attacks were the worst mass murder ever in the United States. \u201cThose responsible deserve the maximum punishment possible. Therefore, accusations of complicity in that mass murder from responsible authorities are a grave matter. Such charges should be levied with care,\u201d they added. \n \n Their comments do not appear to be an attempt to whitewash any Saudi role. The 9/11 report was critical of Saudi Arabia: It cited the government\u2019s funding of schools and mosques that fanned an extreme form of Islam known as Wahhabism, as well as contributions by some wealthy Saudis to Islamic charities with links to terrorism. \n \n During its tenure, the commission investigated all leads in the 28 pages and only one Saudi government employee was implicated in the plot, Mr. Kean and Mr. Hamilton said. He was Fahad al Thumairy, who worked as an imam at a mosque in Los Angeles and was employed by the Saudi Ministry of Islamic Affairs. The commission found no evidence that Mr. Thumairy, who returned to Saudi Arabia in 2003, assisted two of the hijackers when they came to Los Angeles in 2000 but \u201che is still a person of interest,\u201d they wrote. \n \n When it wrapped up its investigation in 2004, the commission concluded that there was \u201cno evidence that the Saudi government as an institution or senior Saudi officials individually funded\u201d al Qaeda. In 2015, another independent panel created by Congress, the 9/11 Review Commission, found no new evidence against the Saudi government. \n \n The director of national intelligence, James Clapper, said on Monday that it was realistic to expect the administration to release at least some of the 28 classified pages by June. Whatever emerges must be weighed in the context of the work already done by Mr. Kean and Mr. Hamilton and their team.",

In an interview with the Guardian, former Navy secretary John Lehman lays it out in blunt terms: \u201cThere was an awful lot of participation by Saudi individuals in supporting the hijackers, and some of those people worked in the Saudi government,\u201d he says. \u201cOur report should never have been read as an exoneration of Saudi Arabia.\u201d Lehman adds that he's not implicating members of the Saudi royal family or top civilian officials, but rather lower-echelon employees, perhaps in the Saudi ministry of Islamic affairs. Last month, the leaders of the commission\u2014former GOP Gov. Tom Kean of New Jersey and former Democratic congressman Lee Hamilton of Indiana\u2014cautioned against releasing the 28 pages and noted that just one Saudi official had been implicated in the plot.

    "document": "Congress has moved to block President Obama\u2019s plan to shift control of the U.S. drone campaign from the CIA to the Defense Department, inserting a secret provision in the massive government spending bill introduced this week that would preserve the spy agency\u2019s role in lethal counterterrorism operations, U.S. officials said. \n \n The measure, included in a classified annex to the $1.1 trillion federal budget plan, would restrict the use of any funding to transfer unmanned aircraft or the authority to carry out drone strikes from the CIA to the Pentagon, officials said. \n \n The provision represents an unusually direct intervention by lawmakers into the way covert operations are run, impeding an administration plan aimed at returning the CIA\u2019s focus to traditional intelligence gathering and possibly bringing more transparency to drone strikes. \n \n The move also reflects some lawmakers\u2019 lingering doubts about the U.S. military\u2019s ability to conduct strikes against al-Qaeda and its regional affiliates without hitting the wrong targets and killing civilians. \n \n Those apprehensions were amplified after a U.S. military strike in Yemen last month killed a dozen people, including as many as six civilians, in an 11-vehicle convoy that tribal leaders said was part of a wedding procession. U.S. officials said that the strike was aimed at a senior al-Qaeda operative but that reviews of the operation have raised concern that it failed to comply with White House guidelines requiring \u201cnear certainty\u201d that no civilians would be harmed. \n \n Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) read from a Washington Post story on the Senate floor Thursday, slamming the Senate and House Appropriations committee for amending a spending bill so that it would affect policy with regard to drones. (The Associated Press) \n \n On Wednesday, there were reports that another U.S. strike had killed a farmer in Yemen. \n \n The extent of the restrictions contained in the drone provision remained unclear. The measure was included by members of the House and Senate appropriations committees, said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly on the legislation. Other senior lawmakers and congressional officials declined to comment on the contents of the classified annex, which details funding for U.S. spy agencies. \n \n Still, senior lawmakers have been vocal in expressing concern about the prospect of the CIA ceding responsibility for drone strikes to the military. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Appropriations Committee, said last year that she had seen the CIA \u201cexercise patience and discretion specifically to prevent collateral damage\u201d and that she \u201cwould really have to be convinced that the military would carry it out that well.\u201d \n \n Feinstein declined to comment on the budget measure this week. But a senior aide said that the senator \u201cstands by her earlier statements\u201d and that the Intelligence Committee has \u201crecently reviewed this issue, and Senator Feinstein believes her views are widely shared on the committee.\u201d \n \n Asked about the scope of that review, the aide said the panel \u201ctook stock of\u201d the program and \u201ccame to a conclusion\u201d but would not elaborate. \n \n Among Feinstein\u2019s colleagues on the Intelligence Committee is Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), who is chairman of the appropriations panel responsible for the budget bill. A spokesman for that committee declined to comment. \n \n There is no mention of the drone provision in the hundreds of pages of the budget blueprint released to the public. A section outlining $572 billion in Pentagon spending notes that \u201cadjustments to classified programs are addressed in the accompanying classified annex.\u201d \n \n The Houes voted to adopt the $1.1-trillion measure that funds the government through the fiscal year. (The Associated Press) \n \n A person familiar with the omnibus bill confirmed that the annex includes language on the drone program but would say only that the provision is more complicated than merely withholding money to prevent drone operations from being transferred to the Pentagon. \n \n Former U.S. officials familiar with the intelligence appropriations process said that aside from placing restrictions on funding, Congress could create other obstacles \u2014 for example, requiring the Pentagon to certify that it has matched the CIA\u2019s capabilities and targeting methodology before it is allowed to proceed. \n \n Spokespeople for the White House, the CIA and the Pentagon declined to comment. \n \n The spending bill sets budgets for agencies across the federal government for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. The measure cleared the House late Wednesday. It is expected to be approved by the Senate this week and delivered to President Obama for his signature as soon as Saturday. \n \n The move by Congress carries implications for the course of the U.S. efforts against al-Qaeda at a time when its affiliates in Yemen, Somalia, Iraq and Syria have become more worrisome to American counterterrorism officials than the terrorist organization\u2019s traditional core. \n \n Also at issue is the fundamental mission of the CIA, which during the past decade has morphed into a paramilitary force. Senior officials, including CIA Director John O. Brennan, have warned that the agency\u2019s emphasis on lethal operations deviates from its traditional mission and could impair its ability to focus on gathering intelligence. \n \n The administration first signaled its intent to shift control of drone operations to the Pentagon last year, when Obama announced new guidelines for counterterrorism missions \u2014 including a pledge of greater transparency \u2014 during a speech at the National Defense University. At the time, administration officials briefing reporters said there would be \u201ca preference for the Department of Defense to engage in the use of force outside war zones.\u201d \n \n The remark was a reference to Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia \u2014 countries beyond the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan, where the United States has carried out drone strikes against al-Qaeda targets. \n \n Obama\u2019s policy shift was expected to mainly affect Yemen, where the CIA and the elite U.S. Joint Special Operations Command conduct overlapping drone campaigns. \n \n The overall pace of strikes has diminished significantly in Pakistan and Yemen, and Brennan has held secret meetings with Pentagon officials in recent months to work out logistical challenges and other impediments to shifting control of drone operations. \n \n But the CIA still carries out the majority of strikes, and the collateral damage that has accompanied some JSOC strikes has generated growing opposition to removing the agency from such operations anytime soon. \n \n The Pentagon has refused to release any details on the Dec. 12 strike carried out by JSOC in Radaa, a district that has become a stronghold for al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP. Yemen initially insisted that only militants had been killed, but it later acknowledged civilian casualties. \n \n The government then delivered rifles and other compensation to victims\u2019 families \u2014 payments that a Yemeni official described as a \u201cdeposit\u201d to encourage clan leaders to take part in tribal mediation and accept further compensation rather than seek retaliation against the Sanaa government. \n \n \u201cThere was a [legitimate] target, and then something happened, a misfire,\u201d the Yemeni official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the secrecy surrounding U.S. strikes. \u201cI\u2019ve never been aware of any incident before where a strike targeted such a large convoy of vehicles.\u201d \n \n AQAP is responsible for near-miss attacks on the United States, including the attempted bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009. The terrorist group has been driven out of territory it had gained over the past two years but is still considered by U.S. officials to pose a serious threat to the United States. \n \n In a meeting with U.S., European and Middle Eastern diplomats last week, Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi described the security situation as unstable and warned specifically of indications that potential al-Qaeda recruits from European and other Western nations were seeking to enter the country, according to U.S. and Yemeni officials. \n \n Lori Montgomery and Ed O\u2019Keefe contributed to this report. ||||| Hooria Mashhour is Yemen\u2019s minister for human rights. \n \n December 12 was supposed to be a day of celebration for the al-Ameri family. A young bride traveled to her wedding with her relatives in Bayda province, Yemen. But in a few dark seconds their celebrations were eviscerated. A U.S. drone fired at the wedding procession, destroying five vehicles and most of their occupants. Not even the bride\u2019s car, ornately decorated in flowers for the occasion, was spared from the carnage. Senior Yemeni officials later admitted that the strike was a \u201cmistake\u201d. \n \n Some mistake: Though the bride survived, the strike is said to have killed at least 14 civilians and injured 22 others, over a third of them seriously. This marks the largest death toll by a drone strike in Yemen since the drone war\u2019s inception. It is also the largest death toll by U.S. strike since December 2009, when a U.S. cruise missile killed 41 civilians in al-Majala, including 14 women and 21 children. \n \n In the wake of the killing, a wave of outrage has swept the country. The Yemeni government rushed to meet community elders, seeking to negotiate a quiet settlement for the killing of the bride\u2019s loved ones. But the bereaved villagers rejected the overtures and instead demanded that Yemen\u2019s president, Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, stop U.S. drones before they would sit at any negotiating table. \n \n On its side, rather than forthrightly address its role in these grim events, the U.S. government has issued no admission of responsibility, nor any apology. It has left the Yemeni government to clean up another bloody mess. \n \n 1 of 86 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Tom Toles goes global View Photos A collection of cartoons about international news.

In November, Yemeni civil engineer Faisal bin Ali Jaber traveled over 7,000 miles to the U.S. in search of answers. He met congressmen, senators, and even some White House officials to tell them how U.S. missiles incinerated his nephew and brother-in-law at his son\u2019s wedding last year. In that strike,the U.S. killed two potential allies \u2013 one an imam who regularly preached against al-Qaeda; the other one of the town\u2019s few policemen. Jaber received heartfelt condolences from many lawmakers. Yet no official was prepared to explain why his relatives were killed, or why the U.S. administration would not acknowledge its mistake. \n \n This is not the first time a U.S. drone has killed civilians in Bayda. On Sept. 2, 2012, a U.S. plane hit a village shuttle near Radda. The vehicle was full of villagers carrying their day\u2019s shopping. As usual, the initial press coverage labelled the dead as \u201cal-Qaeda militants,\u201d but when the relatives threatened to deliver the bodies to the president\u2019s gates, the Yemeni government was forced to concede that all 12 of those people killed were civilians. Among the victims, a pregnant woman and three children were laid to rest. \n \n The use of drones in Yemen might appear a simple, quick-fix option for President Obama. But as Nabeel Khoury, former U.S. deputy chief of mission to Yemen, recently wrote, \u201cDrone strikes take out a few bad guys to be sure, but they also kill a large number of innocent civilians. Given Yemen\u2019s tribal structure, the U.S. generates roughly forty to sixty new enemies for every AQAP [al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] operative killed by drones.\u201d \n \n Let me be clear: I, like the vast majority of my countrymen, reject terrorism. All of us were repulsed by recent footage of a gruesome attack on a Yemeni defense ministry hospital. We agree that our fight against extremist groups cannot be won without a variety of efforts, including robust law enforcement. But more often than not, U.S. drone strikes leave families bereaved and villages terrified. Drones tear at the fabric of Yemeni society. Wronged and angry men are just the sort extreme groups like AQAP find easiest to recruit. \n \n Our president may reassure the United States of his support for drone strikes but the reality is that no leader can legitimately approve the extrajudicial killing of his own citizens. Moreover, he does so in the face of Yemeni consensus. This August, Yemen\u2019s National Dialogue Conference \u2014 which President Obama has praised \u2014 decided by a 90 percent majority that the use of drones in Yemen should be criminalised. \n \n Yemeni legislators are aware that the drone war is deeply unpopular. Since the Dec,. 12 strike, our parliament has unanimously voted to ban drone flights in Yemeni airspace, declaring them a \u201cgrave breach\u201d of the country\u2019s sovereignty. For a country so often divided, this unanimity from Yemen\u2019s most representative bodies testifies to the strength of opinion against drones. But their calls have thus far met only with more bombings from the skies. How can the people of Yemen build trust in their fledgling democracy when our collective will is ignored by democracy\u2019s greatest exponent? ||||| ADEN (Reuters) - A Yemeni farmer was killed in a U.S. drone strike on Wednesday in what witnesses said was an attack apparently intended for suspected Islamist militants in southeastern Yemen. \n \n Witnesses said the farmer was killed by shrapnel from two rockets fired by the drone early in the morning as he walked home in the village of al-Houta, near the city of Shibam. \n \n A local government official confirmed the report but declined to give further details. \n \n The United States has stepped up drone strikes as part of a campaign against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), regarded by Washington as the most active wing of the network. \n \n Yemen, AQAP\u2019s main stronghold, is among a handful of countries where the United States acknowledges using drones, although it does not comment on the practice. \n \n Last month, at least 15 people were killed and five others injured when a drone mistook a wedding party travelling in the central Yemeni province of al-Bayda for an al Qaeda convoy. \n \n Stabilizing Yemen, which is also struggling with southern separatists and northern rebels, is an international priority amid fears of upheaval in a state that flanks top oil producer Saudi Arabia and major shipping lanes.",

Sandusky was sentenced... (Associated Press) \n \n Former Penn State University assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, center, is taken from the Centre County Courthouse by Centre County Sheriff Denny Nau, left, and a deputy, after being sentenced in... (Associated Press) \n \n The State Employees' Retirement System notified Sandusky by letter that his crimes triggered forfeiture of his pension. The former Penn State assistant football coach was sentenced Tuesday to at least 30 years in prison for molesting 10 boys. \n \n The retirement system told Sandusky he will no longer receive his $4,908 monthly annuity and informed his wife, Dottie, she is no longer entitled to a survivor's benefit. \n \n Sandusky's lawyer, Karl Rominger, contended the agency has no legal grounds for revoking the pension and said Sandusky will fight any attempt to do so. \n \n \"It's my inclination to believe that they are just going through the motions to try to throw some red meat to the public, but they know they are going to lose,\" Rominger said. \n \n Pennsylvania's pension forfeiture law, originally passed in 1978, primarily applies to public employees convicted of a financial crime related to the office \"or when his public employment places him in a position to commit the crime.\" \n \n Since 2004, it has also applied to any public school employee convicted of a sex crime against a student. \n \n In its letter to Sandusky, the retirement system said it had determined that two of the criminal charges of which Sandusky was convicted _ involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and indecent assault _ fell under the forfeiture law. \n \n It also said Sandusky maintained extensive ties to Penn State after his 1999 retirement, qualifying him as a \"de facto\" employee subject to forfeiture for crimes committed even when he was no longer on the university's payroll. \n \n SERS' letter to Sandusky was released to The Associated Press in response to an open-records request. \n \n Rominger argued in part that since Sandusky wasn't convicted of molesting a Penn State student, the forfeiture law does not apply to him. Sandusky's young victims came to him through The Second Mile, his charity for troubled youth. \n \n \"It did not involve students where he worked, and that's going to be the crux,\" Rominger said. \n \n But Philadelphia attorney Alaine Williams, an expert on public employee labor law, said courts have broadly construed the forfeiture law. \n \n \"I think he's got a very serious problem,\" she said ahead of the retirement system's announcement. \n \n Sandusky entered the State Employees' Retirement System when he began working as a Penn State football coach in 1969. He collected a $148,000 lump sum payment when he retired from the university in 1999, and began receiving a monthly annuity, according to records provided by SERS. Sandusky received a total of $900,000 in pension payments between 1999 and September 2012. \n \n The forfeiture statute permits an employee to keep his or her contributions without interest, minus any fees or restitution association with the employee's conviction. Employees subject to forfeiture can appeal to the board of the State Employees' Retirement System, then through the state court system. ||||| Story highlights In letters to judge, Sanduskys portray themselves as virtuous victims \n \n The letters all but guaranteed a maximum punishment, legal observers say \n \n \"Sentencing is a time to ask for mercy, not to attack others,\" one expert says \n \n Adopted Sandusky son disappointed by his parents' smearing of his character, lawyers say \n \n When all was said and done, Jerry and Dottie Sandusky did not ask the judge for mercy. They did not try to extol Jerry's virtues, list good deeds or express regret. Instead, they depicted the boys he sexually assaulted as ungrateful and called them liars. \n \n They blamed the young men -- including their own adopted son, Matt, who now claims he, too, was molested -- for their downfall. \n \n In letters to the judge who would sentence the former coach, the Sanduskys portrayed themselves as virtuous victims of a vast conspiracy.

As he wrote about their families, he tried to shift the blame, pointing out that the boys came from unstable homes. \n \n \"Nobody mentioned the impact of abandonment, neglect, abuse, insecurity and conflicting messages that the biological parents might have had in this,\" he wrote. He said nothing about the damaged lives and institutions his molestation case left in its wake. \n \n Read the letters (.PDF) \n \n Instead, both Sanduskys wrote that the justice system let them down. \n \n Just as letters to one of the boys he was accused of molesting helped secure his conviction, the letters to the judge all but guaranteed a maximum punishment, legal observers say. \n \n Cleland, who presided over the trial and sentenced Sandusky on Tuesday to 30 to 60 years in prison, noted that others wrote letters as well. But he indicated that he considered only the Sanduskys' letters in handing down a sentence that, for a 68-year-old man, is likely to be a life prison term. \n \n Victim to Sandusky: 'Because of you, I trust no one' \n \n \"Sentencing is a time to ask for mercy, not to attack others,\" said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who teaches legal ethics at Loyola Law School. \"In my experience, judges really hate letters that try to shift the blame to others or which belittle the victims or the court.\" \n \n B.J. Bernstein, an Atlanta attorney who comments on legal matters for CNN, agreed that Sandusky didn't do himself any favors. \n \n \"The old adage 'if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all' applies to sentencing statements,\" Bernstein said. \"It is awkward when you deny you are culpable and a jury says otherwise. For appellate purposes Sandusky was never going to accept responsibility or admit doing something wrong, but lashing out at everyone so strongly was irrational.\" \n \n She added that Sandusky might have thought he was still playing to his Penn State fan base, but it backfired. \n \n \"Between Jerry and Dottie's vicious protestations of innocence,\" Bernstein said, \"all I can think is the victims -- and in particular their son Matt -- should shout back the lyrics from the Eric Clapton song, 'Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself.'\" \n \n Sandusky's son comes forward as victim \n \n Jerry Sandusky bashed victims and laid out the conspiracy theory in a pre-recorded interview leaked to a campus radio station on the eve of his sentencing. He hinted at it again when he spoke in court on Tuesday, after being warned by his lawyers to avoid criticizing his victims or the justice system. \n \n His performances on air and in the courtroom were widely derided by prosecutors, legal analysts and commentators as narcissistic, self-absorbed and even more hurtful to the young men he was convicted of molesting. \n \n Jerry Sandusky's letter expanded on the rambling, 15-minute courtroom soliloquy that touched on everything from the writer Henry David Thoreau to \"special inmate friends\" to wet kisses from dogs. Like that speech, it was part locker room pep talk and part Sunday school inspirational, with a heaping side order of the Frank Sinatra ballad \"My Way.\" \n \n He wrote about life in protective custody, and how it led him to think about all the interests that were being protected as the case unfolded: \"The system protected the system, the media, the prosecution, the civil attorneys and the accusers. Everybody protected themselves,\" he wrote. \n \n \"Penn State, with its own system, protected their public image,\" he continued. \"Media protected their jobs and ambitions. Prosecutors protected their jobs and egos. The accusers were protected and provided access to potential financial gain, free attorneys, accolades, psychologists and attention.\" \n \n McQueary files lawsuit against Penn State \n \n He wrote that he was heartbroken. \n \n \"My trust in people, systems and fairness has diminished,\" he said. \"In my heart I know I did not do these disgusting acts. However, I didn't tell the jury. Our son changed our plans when he switched sides.\" \n \n Matt Sandusky was 18 when he was adopted by the Sanduskys after spending time with them in foster care. The relationship always has been rocky, but it collapsed near the end of Sandusky's trial in June. As the prosecution's case drew to a close, Matt told investigators that Sandusky had molested him, too. \n \n Matt Sandusky, now 33, did not testify for either side, but Jerry Sandusky insists that his adopted son's desertion and potentially damaging testimony kept him from testifying in his own defense. \n \n The Sanduskys spared no one. \n \n \"There were so many people involved in the orchestration of this conviction (media, investigators, prosecutors, \"the system,\" Penn State and the accusers.) It was well done. They won!\" Jerry Sandusky wrote, as if a tragic court case about molested children was an epic gridiron contest. \n \n \"When I thought about how it had transpired, I wondered what they had won,\" he continued. \"I thought of the methods, decisions and allegations. I relived the inconsistencies and dishonest testimonies.\" He pondered what would happen if the tables were turned. \n \n When the hero falls off the pedestal: The emotion of betrayal \n \n \"What would be the outcome if all the accusers and their families who were investigated?\" he wrote. \"I knew the answer. All their issues would surface. They would no longer be these poor, innocent people as portrayed.\" \n \n Dottie Sandusky also wrote of her disappointment, saying she has lost faith in the police and the legal system. \"To think that they can lie and get by with the lies. The press has been unbelievable. People who have not met us are writing untruths.\" \n \n Dottie Sandusky's letter is revealing because she has stood silently by her husband in court. She testified at his trial that she never heard or saw anything strange or sexual going on in the basement of their home, where many of the victims say her husband molested them. \n \n In her letter, she unloaded on her adopted son, Matt. \n \n \"People need to know what kind of person he is,\" she wrote. \"We have forgiven him many times for all he has done to our family, thinking that he was changing his life, but he would always go back to his stealing and lies. He has been diagnose (sic) Bipolar, but he refuses to take his medicine.\" \n \n Records from Centre County's probation department and juvenile courts tell part of the story of how Matt H., as he was known, came to the Sanduskys. \n \n Like the boys who testified against Sandusky at the trial, Matt participated in Sandusky's youth mentoring program, The Second Mile. Jerry Sandusky was in Southern California, preparing for the Rose Bowl, when Matt was arrested in 1995. Sandusky called personally and pulled strings to make sure Matt was placed under his care and not sent to juvenile detention. \n \n Opinion: For the victims, it's about more than locking him up \n \n The court documents detail Matt's continuing troubles, including an aspirin overdose in March 1996 that is characterized as a suicide attempt. But he maintained that he wanted to stay in the Sandusky home, writing to the court, \"I feel that they have supported me even when I have messed up. They are a loving, caring group of people. They have showed me what a family is really like.\" \n \n In another instance, Sandusky called police to his house, claiming a burglar was trying to break in. It was Matt, who said he had come to the house for a power tool. \n \n Matt Sandusky now is represented by a law firm in State College that is handling the cases of several other Sandusky molestation victims. \n \n \"Matt is extremely disappointed that Dottie and the Sanduskys have decided to smear his character in an attempt to deflect attention from Jerry Sandusky's heinous crimes,\" his lawyers Justine Andronici and Andrew Shubin said in a written statement to CNN. \n \n \"Matt has shown tremendous courage and strength,\" the statement continued. \"Rather than supporting her son when he made the gut-wrenching decision to come forward and tell the truth about the abuse he suffered at the hands of Jerry Sandusky, Dottie Sandusky has chosen to continue Jerry's strategy of blaming and attacking the victims, thereby perpetuating the abuse.\" \n \n Dottie Sandusky wrote that her adopted son \"has had many run-ins with the law and stolen money and items from our family. We still love him and want the best for him, but because of his actions we cannot express this to him. ...\" \n \n Karl Rominger, a lawyer for Sandusky, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the State Attorney General's office said prosecutors \"stand by\" what they said Tuesday about Sandusky's victim and system bashing. \n \n The lead prosecutor, Joseph McGettigan, described Sandusky's behavior as \"banal, self-delusional, completely untethered from reality. It was entirely-self-focused, as if he himself were the victim.\" \n \n Jerry Sandusky trial: All you need to know about allegations, how case unfolded ||||| Seeing is believing \n \n The home of over 5.1 million full archive pages of The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News print editions \n \n Search and browse our historical collection to find news, notices of births, marriages and deaths, sports, comics, and much more \n \n Dates range from 1860 to today for The Philadelphia Inquirer and 1960 to today for the Philadelphia Daily News",

Sandusky pointed out that the boys came from unstable homes. \"Nobody mentioned the impact of abandonment, neglect, abuse, insecurity, and conflicting messages that the biological parents might have had in this,\" he wrote. The couple, echoing a recording Sandusky made before sentencing, blamed his downfall on a vast conspiracy involving police and the media.

Sandusky was sentenced to at least 30 years in prison yesterday for molesting 10 boys, and the SERS determined that two of the charges fell under a state law that strips public school employees of their pensions when they are convicted of a sex crime against a student. \"It's my inclination to believe that they are just going through the motions to try to throw some red meat to the public, but they know they are going to lose,\" said Sandusky's lawyer. Sandusky's lawyer argued that since he wasn't convicted of molesting a Penn State student, the forfeiture law doesn't apply to him. \"It did not involve students where he worked, and that's going to be the crux,\" he said. But Philadelphia attorney Alaine Williams, an expert on public employee labor law, said courts have broadly construed the forfeiture law. \"I think he's got a very serious problem.\"",

Young gave chase but was stopped by a guard, who made him prove he was a hotel guest, sources said. \n \n Someone in Shanks group called 911 \u2014 and the Tigers terror was arrested on charges of aggravated harassment in the second degree, a misdemeanor with a hate-crime element. \n \n Shank only suffered scratches and bleeding to his arm. \n \n Young was taken to Roosevelt Hospital to dry out before he could be processed. \n \n He was later taken to Midtown North Precinct, where he slept off the rest of his stupor. \n \n Young, who missed tonight\u2019s game against the Yankees, was arraigned around 7 p.m. and freed on $5,000 bail. \n \n Young\u2019s lawyer, Dan Ollen, called the bail \u201csilly\u201d and \u201cridiculous.\u201d \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s a world famous baseball player\u201d who has every reason to come back to court, he said. \n \n \u201cHe has no criminal record,\u201d and \u201cthe chance of jail in this case is extremely unlikely.\u201d \n \n Ollen added that a videotape of the incident shows Shanks groups were the instigators. \n \n \u201cSomeone in the other party says something that causes him to react,\u201d Ollen said.

I take this matter very seriously and assure everyone that I will do everything I can to improve myself as a person and player.\u201d \n \n Tigers brass said: \u201cWe need to allow the legal process to take its course. \n \n This is just the latest trouble for the hot-tempered Young, an outfielder who was suspended for 50 games in 2006 in the minors for chucking a bat at an umpire. \n \n A former Twin, Young joined the Tigers last last season and homered in his first playoff at bat for the team in last year\u2019s ALDS against the Yankees. \n \n This year the team signed him to a one-year $6, 725,000 contract. \n \n \u2014 Additional reporting by Dareh Gregorian, Kevin Fasick and Todd Venezia ||||| As his teammates prepared tonight for their series opener at Yankee Stadium, Tigers outfielder Delmon Young was arraigned in a Manhattan courtroom, accused of a hate crime. Police said he used an anti-Semitic slur against four men and tackled one of them. \n \n Young, 26, was intoxicated during an early morning physical confrontation with the men outside the Hilton New York along Sixth Avenue, Detective Joseph Cavitolo, a New York police spokesman, told the Free Press. \n \n The misdemeanor charge \u2014 aggravated harassment \u2014 is punishable by up to a year in jail. The charge was submitted as a hate crime \u201cbecause of a belief and perception regarding \u2026 religion (and) religious practice,\u201d according to the court document filed tonight. \n \n Just before he was released on a $5,000 bond, Young issued a statement apologizing and saying he wants to \u201cimprove myself as a person and player.\u201d \n \n \u201cI sincerely regret what happened last night,\u201d Young\u2019s statement read, which was released through his attorney, Daniel Ollen, and a New York-based public relations firm. \n \n \u201cI apologize to everyone I affected, the Ilitch family, the Detroit Tigers\u2019 organization, my teammates, my family and the great Tigers fans that have supported me since Day One,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cI take this matter very seriously, and assure everyone that I will do everything I can to improve myself as a person and player.\u201d \n \n Young\u2019s statement did not specifically address the allegations. \n \n Ollen, his attorney, also released a statement, saying, \u201cThere are many false allegations\u201d in the case. \n \n \u201cI am confident that the legal process will separate fact from fiction and discredit these reports,\u201d it read. \n \n According to police, the confrontation began about 2:30 a.m. after a group of four men spoke with a panhandler wearing a yarmulke outside the hotel. \n \n \u201cThey have a discussion, and the panhandler leaves,\u201d Cavitolo told the Free Press. \n \n \u2022 Jewish leader reacts \n \n According to court documents and police, the anti-Semitic slur and the physical exchange came next: \n \n \u2022 Words were exchanged between Young and the men, at which point Young allegedly said, \u201cYou bunch of (expletive) Jews.\u201d \n \n \u2022 Young, listed at 6 feet 3 and 240 pounds, pushed and shoved one of the men, then tackled him to the ground, causing minor injuries to the man\u2019s elbow. \n \n \u2022 Young then followed the man, 32, into the hotel\u2019s lobby. \n \n It was not immediately clear whether the man, who refused medical attention, is Jewish, Cavitolo said. \n \n Called to the scene, police interviewed witnesses and the victim. \n \n A short time later, police said Young was sent to a nearby hospital because he was intoxicated. He was returned to police for fingerprinting and paper work. He was escorted into a police car from the building \u2014 amid a knot of reporters \u2014 about 11 a.m. \n \n As details of the allegations developed during the day, the Tigers officially said little, citing club policy not to comment on pending legal matters. \n \n At Yankee Stadium, manager Jim Leyland deferred all questions about Young to Dave Dombrowski, the Tigers\u2019 president and general manager, who was expected to talk before the game but didn\u2019t. \n \n Asked how the incident might affect his lineup, Leyland wouldn\u2019t address the question, simply stating that his lineup was already posted outside the clubhouse. \n \n He had inserted Don Kelly into leftfield \u2014 Young\u2019s position \u2014 and he used newcomer Brad Eldred as his designated hitter. \n \n Because of the pending legal situation and alleged involvement of alcohol, none of Young\u2019s teammates would address the matter, either. For those same reasons, Major League Baseball is unlikely to suspend Young or take any other disciplinary action \u2014 at least until the legal issues are resolved. \n \n Baseball precedent, however, suggests that Young likely will go through professional evaluation in the sport\u2019s Employee Assistance Program. This probably will be similar to what baseball had Tigers third baseman Miguel Cabrera do after his drunken driving arrest in spring training last year. \n \n \u201cWe are looking into the situation, but because it is a police matter, we cannot comment further,\u201d said Pat Courtney, spokesman for Major League Baseball. \n \n \u2022 Other recent alcohol-related incidents for the Tigers \n \n On Thursday night, the Tigers traveled to New York after a 1-6 home stand. They are staying at the Hilton New York on Sixth Avenue \u2014 also known as the Avenue of the Americas. The hotel is a favorite spot for professional sports teams. \n \n Only five blocks north of Times Square, the hotel is one of the city\u2019s largest. By day, it bustles with tourists and the business activity of Midtown. By night, it is home to dozens of sidewalk food vendors, many of them selling chicken kabobs and halal food. \n \n One vendor, who wanted to remain nameless, said that, on most nights, say between 2:30 and 3 a.m., especially from Thursday to Saturday, patrons spill from nearby bars and pubs and queue up at the trucks, looking for something hot and spicy. \n \n The food vendors set up on both sides of Sixth Avenue at 52nd Street, just across from the hotel entrance. \n \n The Tigers acquired Young from Minnesota on Aug. 15 in their push to win the American League Central. The deal sent minor leaguer Cole Nelson and a player to be named (another minor leaguer, Lester Oliveros) to the Twins. Young played leftfield for the Tigers, homered in his first at-bat and helped boost the offense down the stretch as the Tigers won their first division title since 1987. In 40 games, he drove in 32 runs and hit eight home runs. In the playoffs, he added five more homers. \n \n In the off-season, the Tigers signed Young to a one-year contract worth $6.75 million. He will be a free agent after this season. \n \n Dombrowski said after the 2011 season: \u201cIt\u2019s not a priority\u201d to try to sign Young to a multi-year deal during the off-season. \u201cWe want him to be with us (longer) and get a feel for him. He only joined us for a short time. We would rather have him be with us and go from there.\u201d \n \n Young drove in 112 runs for the Twins in 2010, with 21 homers and a .298 average, but he had only 32 RBIs in 84 games in 2011 before he was traded to the Tigers. \n \n So far this season, Young has batted fifth, behind superstars Cabrera and Prince Fielder. Like most of his teammates, Young has struggled at the plate in recent weeks. He is hitting .242 with only one homer and five RBIs in 18 games. He went a combined 0-for-10 with two walks in his last three games, all losses to the Seattle Mariners. \n \n Young, a right-handed hitter born in Montgomery, Ala., was the No. 1 pick in the 2003 draft, selected by Tampa Bay. He received notoriety for an April 2006 incident in the minor leagues. After a called third strike, he whipped his bat and hit the umpire on the arm. He was suspended 50 games. \n \n Young\u2019s older brother, Dmitri, played five seasons for the Tigers. The club let him go less than a month before it made the playoffs in 2006. \n \n Contact Robin Erb: 313-222-2708 or rerb@freepress.com. Sports writer John Lowe contributed to this report.",

For example, the United States only includes consumer electronics such as TVs and computers, whereas European nations include everything that has a battery or power cord in the e-waste category. \n \n \"This is why we have developed this e-waste map. It's the first time we're introducing really comparable data,\" said Ruediger Kuehr of United Nations University, in Germany, and executive secretary of the StEP Initiative. \"In addition, it gives magnitude to the issue on a national level, so policymakers are aware of the issue in order to take action,\" Kuehr told LiveScience. \n \n Mapping worldwide e-waste \n \n The U.S. and China produce more total e-waste than any other country. [ See full-size infographic Credit: Ross Toro, Infographic Artist \n \n The interactive e-waste map shows data from 184 countries on the estimated amount of electrical and electronic equipment that hits the market and how much e-waste it ultimately generates. Having this data could help governments and companies manage their e-waste. \n \n The world produced nearly 54 million tons (49 million metric tons) of used electrical and electronic products last year. That's an average of about 43 lbs. (20 kg), or the weight of eight bricks, for each of the 7 billion people on Earth. \n \n The StEP Initiative forecasts that by 2017, the world will produce about 33 percent more e-waste, or 72 million tons (65 million metric tons). That amount weighs about 11 times as much as the Great Pyramid of Giza. \n \n China currently leads the world in production of electrical and electronic equipment. In 2012, China produced about 12.2 million tons (11.1 million metric tons), followed by the U.S. with about 11 million tons (10 million metric tons). \n \n However, the United States eclipses China in e-waste generation, because more products previously put on the market in the U.S. are likely to be retired. In 2012, the U.S. produced about 10.4 million tons (9.4 million metric tons), versus China's 8 million tons (7.3 million metric tons). \n \n The U.S. generated the seventh highest amount of e-waste per person \u2014 about 66 lbs. (30 kg) per capita. (The country with the highest per capita e-waste was Qatar.) \n \n E-waste in the U.S. \n \n The U.S. National Center for Electronics Recycling (NCER) and MIT have released a detailed report on U.S. generation, collection and export of used electronics in conjunction with the e-waste map. \n \n The U.S. generated about 258.2 million units of used computers, monitors, TVs and cellphones in 2010, 171.4 million of which were collected for recycling, and 14.4 million were exported, according to the report. [Green Guide to Holiday Electronic Gifts (Op-Ed)] \n \n The U.S. is a major exporter of used electronics. The U.S. exports more CRT (cathode ray tube) monitors by weight than any other product, and more cellphones than any other electronics product in terms of numbers. \n \n However, export numbers could be an underestimate, because exporters want to keep them quiet in order to bypass restrictions or bad press, said Jason Linnell, executive director of NCER. \n \n In terms of recycling, \"We are a little bit behind compared with countries in the European Union,\" Linnell told LiveScience.European countries have had established e-waste recycling programs for more than 10 years, whereas only 25 U.S. states have started similar programs, Linnell said. \n \n But recycling of e-waste is on the rise. \"We're seeing more recycling programs, and a lot of states are collecting 5 to 6 lbs. (2.3 to 2.7 kg) of e-waste per person per year,\" he said. \n \n \"It's better than the past, but we we still have a ways to go,\" Linnell said. \n \n Follow Tanya Lewis on Twitterand Google+.

And now, a world e-waste map \u2014 the first of its kind \u2014 shows just how staggering. \n \n The average Canadian, for example, generated about 24 kilograms of e-waste in 2012. That\u2019s more than 860,000 tonnes for the entire country, roughly equivalent to the weight of about 1,700 fully loaded Boeing 747s at take off. \n \n But the biggest producer of e-waste is the United States, with an astonishing 9,359,000 tonnes produced in 2012, about 29 kilograms per person, according to the map, which was created by a number of agencies through their \u201csolving e-waste problem\u201d (StEP) initiative. \n \n The numbers are mind-boggling, said Josh Lepawsky, a professor at Memorial University in St. John\u2019s, N.L., and a member of StEP. \n \n \u201cThe main purpose (of the map) is to give a sense how much electronic waste is present in any given any country,\u201d said Lepawsky. \n \n It also allows a comparison between purchasing power in different countries, which is a measure of wealth, he said. \n \n (The richer the country, the more e-waste it generally generates.) \n \n By 2017, the volume of discarded e-products worldwide is expected to be 33 per cent higher than in 2012 and weigh the equivalent of eight of the Great Pyramids of Egypt. \n \n Haiti is among the lowest producers of e-waste in the world, with less than 8,000 tonnes produced in 2012, or less than one kilogram per person. \n \n Afghanistan, too, was among the lowest in the world, with less than 19,000 tonnes of e-waste for the country, or 0.58 kilogram per person. \n \n The map is surprising in parts, said Lepawsky. \n \n Singapore is much wealthier than Canada, he said, \u201cwhen you look at e-waste generated.\u201d In Singapore, a tiny country, the average person generated about 36 kilograms in 2012. \n \n \u201cThe world is changing quite quickly,\u201d he said. \n \n Luxembourg is another example. \n \n It has a much smaller population than the U.S., 520,000, compared to more than 314 million, but more new electrical and electronic equipment comes to the market in Luxembourg per capita. \n \n (The U.S. is the largest consumer in absolute terms but it is behind Luxembourg in per capita terms.) \n \n It is a disheartening number, said Miriam Diamond, a professor in the department of earth sciences at the University of Toronto, referring to the e-waste that emanates from Canada. \n \n \u201cIt represents throwing away a tremendous amount of energy that went into making it in the first place.\u201d \n \n Used electronics often make their way to the developing world where some are reused. \n \n But, Diamond says, \u201cIn a lot of the recycling sector, they are dismantled by hand. That is a serious threat to health and the environment.\u201d \n \n Innovation is a trademark in the world of electronics, especially in the world of cellphones, laptops and computers, where engineers come up with distinct, sleek styles to lure people to buy more. \n \n \u201cWhy won\u2019t these same smart people also find a way that electronics can be used longer or reused in the best way, too?\u201d she asked. \n \n The cost of mining new resources is also staggering. \n \n \u201cThese minerals that we mine are scarce. . . is it worth it? Mining, too, has negative impact on people and places.\u201d \n \n For Lepawsky, the solution to the tonnes of e-waste is relatively simple. \n \n \u201cStop buying new electronics; use what you have for longer,\u201d he said, adding that sometimes buying new products is about fashion more than anything else. ||||| An employee holds circuit boards at the Coopermiti warehouse of electronic waste in Sao Paulo March 6, 2013. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Brazil generates the greatest amount of electronic waste (e-waste) per capita among emerging countries. \n \n OSLO (Reuters) - China and other emerging economies have overtaken Western nations in dumping old electronic goods, from TVs to cellphones, and will lead a projected 33 percent surge in the amount of waste from 2012 to 2017, a U.N.-backed alliance said on Sunday. \n \n The report, the first to map electronic waste by country to promote recycling and safer disposal of often toxic parts, shows how the economic rise of developing nations is transforming the world economy even in terms of pollution. \n \n \"The e-waste problem requires attention globally,\" Ruediger Kuehr of the U.N. University and executive secretary of the Solving the E-Waste Problem (StEP) initiative, told Reuters. StEP is run by U.N. agencies, governments, NGOs and scientists. \n \n The weight of electronic goods discarded every year worldwide would rise to 65.4 million tonnes from 2012 to 2017 from 48.9 million in 2012, with most of the growth in developing nations, StEP said. \n \n By 2017, it would make the annual piles of old washing machines, computers, fridges, electronic toys and other goods with an electric cord or battery the weight equivalent of 200 Empire State Buildings or 11 Great Pyramids of Giza, it said. \n \n Some waste from rich countries ends up in developing nations, where many people work in hazardous conditions for low wages dismantling it. \n \n Waste from emerging countries, as well as Russia and other former Soviet bloc nations, overtook totals from Western nations such as the United States, the European Union, Japan and Australia around 2012, StEP data showed. \n \n In that year, the West produced 23.5 million tonnes of waste and all others 25.4 million, a shift from the previous estimates for 2007 when the West accounted for most, StEP said. \n \n MOUNTAINS OF TRASH \n \n By 2017, trash from the West would rise to 28.6 million tonnes, far less than the 36.7 million from other countries, a side-effect of the economic rise of emerging nations such as India, Brazil and South Africa. \n \n \"Although there is ample information about the negative environmental and health impacts of primitive e-waste recycling methods, the lack of comprehensive data has made it hard to grasp the full magnitude of the problem,\" Kuehr said in the report. \n \n Consumers could help with better recycling, especially at Christmas, he said. \n \n Waste can be valuable if recycled. One study estimated that a million cellphones can yield 24 kg (53 lb) of gold, 250 kg of silver, 9 kg of palladium and more than 9 tonnes of copper. \n \n Sunday's report also showed that the average person on the planet produces 7 kg of electronic waste every year. Americans were among the highest with 29.8 kg each. \n \n Separately, U.S.-based experts trying to track the fate of waste said that about two-thirds of U.S. electronics waste is collected for re-use or recycling and that only 8.5 percent of the collected units are exported. \n \n Bigger electronic items, especially TVs and computer monitors, were exported to nations including Mexico, Venezuela, Paraguay and China, it said. Smaller items often went to Asia. \n \n Jeremy Gregory, of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a co-author of the report, told Reuters it was hard to track trade because the waste is often merely described as \"mixed metals\" on import documents. \n \n StEP urged nations to adopt clearer trade descriptions. \n \n For StEP maps, click here: here \n \n (Editing by Alison Williams)",

    "document": "A good night\u2019s sleep can be transformative. Among its benefits are improved energy and mood, better immune system functioning and blood sugar regulation, and greater alertness and ability to concentrate. Given all of these benefits, the fact that a third of the human lifespan is spent sleeping makes evolutionary sense. However, sleep appears to have another important function: helping us learn. Across a plethora of memory tasks\u2014involving word lists, maze locations, auditory tones, and more\u2014going to sleep after training yields better performance than remaining awake. This has prompted many sleep researchers to reach a provocative conclusion: beyond merely supporting learning, sleep is vital, and perhaps even directly responsible, for learning itself. \n \n Recent discoveries from neuroscience provide insights into that possibility. Sleep appears to be important for long-term potentiation, a strengthening of signals between neurons that is widely regarded as a mechanism of learning and memory. Certain memories acquired during the day appear to be reactivated and \u201creplayed\u201d in the brain during sleep, which may help make them longer lasting. In some instances the amount of improvement that occurs on memory tasks positively correlates with the length of time spent in certain stages of sleep. These and other findings are generating great excitement among sleep researchers, as well as prompting heated debates about the degree to which sleep may or may not be involved in learning. \n \n To date, most sleep and learning research has focused on recall, which is the capacity to remember information. However, new research by St\u00e9phanie Mazza and colleagues at the University of Lyon, recently published in the journal Psychological Science, suggests another potential benefit of sleep: improved relearning. Relearning refers to the process of re-acquiring forgotten information. Because we cannot possibly remember all of the information that we encounter, it is often necessary to go back and learn that information again. That\u2019s when relearning occurs\u2014such as when preparing for an exam, taking a refresher course, or simply revisiting a topic after an extended period of time. According to this new research, sleep supercharges relearning: it can enable us to relearn twice as quickly and up to three times more effectively. \n \n In the study, 40 French-speaking adult participants learned a list of 16 Swahili-French word pairs (for example, nyanya-tomate), relearned those word pairs after a period of 12 hours that did or did not include sleep, and were tested on their memory for the word pairs after one week and after six months. Each participant completed the study as part of a randomly-assigned \u201cwake\u201d or \u201csleep\u201d group. In the wake group, the initial learning session occurred at 9 AM and the relearning session occurred at 9 PM on the same day; in the sleep group, the initial learning session occurred at 9 PM and the relearning session occurred at 9 AM on the next day, after a night of sleep. During the learning session, participants first studied all of the word pairs. Next, the Swahili word from each pair was shown by itself while participants attempted to recall its French equivalent. After each attempt, the correct answer was displayed, allowing participants to study further. The learning session concluded after each pair was successfully recalled once. At the relearning session, participants again attempted to recall the French word of each pair, and then continued cycling through the entire list until they could recall all pairs perfectly. Thus, by the time the relearning session was complete, any word pair that had been forgotten in the intervening 12 hours had been practiced until it could be correctly recalled once more. \n \n During the initial learning session there were no observed performance differences between the sleep and wake groups, which suggests that a similar degree of learning occurred in both groups. However, substantial differences emerged at the relearning session: participants in the sleep group recalled an average of 10 word pairs on their first attempt, whereas those in the wake group could only muster up about 7; in addition, those that had slept took only about three cycles through the list to finish relearning, whereas those that had not slept needed twice that amount. Even the lowest-performing members of the sleep group\u2014those that had forgotten more word pairs than other members and had the most to relearn\u2014still took fewer cycles to relearn than the best performing (and least forgetful) members of the wake group. \n \n Along with that impressive result, a benefit of having slept between the learning and relearning sessions was also evident over the long term. After one week, participants in the sleep group correctly recalled more word pairs than those in the wake group (an average of 15 vs. 11), and after six months, their recall performance, while attenuated due to some forgetting, was three times better than that of the wake group (an average of 9 vs. 3). Thus, despite the fact that both groups had practiced to a level of perfect recall during the relearning session, only those that had slept prior to relearning accrued any long-term memory benefits. \n \n The fact that participants in the sleep group engaged in relearning was also critical for their improved long-term performance. In a follow-up to the main experiment, a control group of 20 additional participants followed nearly all of the same procedures as the sleep group, including training at the same times of day and sleeping after initial learning. However, in place of the relearning session, these participants only briefly practiced the list of word pairs one time. Without relearning, their subsequent recall performance was no better than the wake group. Thus, it was the combination of sleeping after initial learning, plus engaging in relearning itself, that generated long-term memory benefits. \n \n Mazza and her colleagues interpreted their results as evidence that sleep \u201ctransforms\u201d memories, making the effects of initial learning stronger and empowering subsequent relearning. By this interpretation, sleep not only prevents memories from being forgotten, it also makes it easier to restore memories during relearning. In support of this conclusion, the authors noted that total sleep time was positively correlated with recall and relearning performance (the longer participants slept, the better they tended to do on both). This pattern, similar to that observed in prior research, is consistent with two possibilities: either a sleep-specific mechanism boosts learning, which sets the stage for improved relearning, or sleep allows regularly occurring learning processes to occur without interference, which also boosts memory and expedites relearning. Both possibilities remain viable in this and related research, thus inviting future studies to tease the two apart. \n \n Moreover, while this latest study reveals an important and largely unknown potential benefit of sleep, it remains to be determined whether the same benefits will manifest in other circumstances (such as when relearning non-verbal materials). It is also important to note that Mazza and her colleagues had their sleep and wake groups train at different times of day. In a recent meta-analysis of sleep and motor learning research, Tim Rickard and I found that such \u201cvaried time\u201d experimental designs often yield better performance in sleep vs. wake groups regardless of whether there is a sleep-specific learning benefit. This may be due to the fact that humans vary in fatigue levels, alertness, and other characteristics according to the time of day and their natural urge to sleep\u2014differences that may not necessarily manifest in the sleepiness surveys that participants of sleep studies are often asked to take (as occurred in the present study). Further research in which the sleep and wake groups are not subjected to such widely divergent schedules is needed to address this issue. \n \n At present, these new results suggest that sleeping between study sessions can be a particularly potent learning strategy, and especially when learners take the time to repeatedly revisit and relearn in order to achieve a high level of performance. For instance, if a set of materials needs to be completely mastered, such as an official manual in preparation for a licensure exam, then those materials should be repeatedly studied across multiple study sessions and in between periods of sleep. Scheduling those study sessions to occur shortly before going to bed is also likely to improve future remembering and relearning. In a world where an uninterrupted night of sleep seems to be increasingly rare\u2014and many of us try expensive and unproven ways to improve learning and memory\u2014these may be some of the most compelling reasons yet to embrace the Land of Nod. ||||| Abstract \n \n Both repeated practice and sleep improve long-term retention of information. The assumed common mechanism underlying these effects is memory reactivation, either on-line and effortful or off-line and effortless. In the study reported here, we investigated whether sleep-dependent memory consolidation could help to save practice time during relearning. During two sessions occurring 12 hr apart, 40 participants practiced foreign vocabulary until they reached a perfect level of performance. Half of them learned in the morning and relearned in the evening of a single day. The other half learned in the evening of one day, slept, and then relearned in the morning of the next day. Their retention was assessed 1 week later and 6 months later. We found that interleaving sleep between learning sessions not only reduced the amount of practice needed by half but also ensured much better long-term retention. Sleeping after learning is definitely a good strategy, but sleeping between two learning sessions is a better strategy.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's well established through previous research that sleep after learning is best for many memory-related tasks, including word lists, mazes, auditory tones, and so on. Sleep seems so vital to recall that some speculate it is directly responsible for, not just supportive of, learning, reports Scientific American. So researchers out of the University of Lyon chose to investigate another aspect of learning\u2014not recall but relearning, where something previously learned has been forgotten and must be re-acquired. Reporting in the journal Psychological Science in August, they wroite that, coupled with practice, \"Sleep makes perfect,\" and that \"sleeping after learning is definitely a good strategy, but sleeping between two learning sessions is a better strategy.\" The team tested 40 French-speaking adults tasked with learning 16 Swahili words. Some learned them at night, slept, and relearned them in the morning, while others learned the words in the morning, didn't sleep, and relearned them at night. The group that slept between sessions performed so much better that even those who forgot the most words relearned them faster during their morning session than the least forgetful members of the group relearning the words at night. The results don't clarify which is at play\u2014sleep boosting learning, which helps improve later relearning, or sleep simply allowing for uninterrupted learning processes to speed up relearning\u2014but either way, sleeping between studying seems worth a shot.

The college also asked the investigative team, irrespective of its findings, to share recommendations for ways Smith could improve its policies and practices on interactions with persons who may be perceived as suspicious. \n \n Q: Did the external report find the July 31, 2018 incident was the result of bias? \n \n A. No. The investigators ultimately concluded that \u201cthe Caller provided a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for calling the Campus Police on the day of the Incident.\u201d Further, \u201cthe Investigative Team did not find sufficient information that this decision was based on the Reported Party\u2019s race or color, or violated the Policy.\u201d Nevertheless, the report acknowledges that the student was having lunch near a campus dining area, and that she was put in fear when the officer approached her. \n \n Q: Has the college responded to the student\u2019s request for an apology and to meet with the caller? \n \n A: Yes. President McCartney apologized publicly on August 2, 2018. President McCartney also reached out to the student on August 3, to personally apologize and offer to meet and continues to welcome a meeting with the student. The college offered restorative justice mediation between the student and the caller. The caller has agreed to mediation, and the offer remains open. \n \n Q: Has the college responded to the student\u2019s requests for affinity housing, employee training, changes in policies and procedures, and investigation of the legacy of President Emeritus Neilson? \n \n A: Yes. \n \n Regarding specific requests from the student and the ACLU, President McCartney\u2019s letter to the community on September 4 includes pertinent information, including new and existing initiatives. These include: \n \n Affinity housing: The college\u2019s Residential Experience Working Group, which was established earlier this summer, will conduct a comprehensive examination of how Smith, as an educational institution and a residential college, can optimize the learning potential of living and dining in community. This group will address, among other things, affinity housing. \n \n Employee training: The college committed to mandatory anti-bias training for staff and faculty. Please see President McCartney\u2019s October 20 email for more information. \n \n Changes in policies and procedures: The college currently has policies prohibiting race and gender discrimination and robust procedures for prevention and enforcement. See, for example: \n \n For additional information on potential policy changes, see President McCartney\u2019s October 29 letter to the community. \n \n William Allan Neilson served as president of Smith from 1917 to 1939. The ACLU has circulated an excerpt from a previously published 1927 letter from Neilson referencing segregation and student housing. The public is welcome to view and assess Neilson\u2019s legacy via his personal papers, including those that reference his service on the board of the NAACP and his role in founding the Legal Defense and Education Fund of the NAACP. \n \n Out of an interest for transparency and to support research into Neilson\u2019s views on race, the college has digitized two sets of documents: \n \n The full letter referenced by the ACLU is available in the first link. \n \n The college continues to evaluate additional reforms proposed by the student, guided by the findings and recommendations in the report. As part of the review process, Smith also looks forward to input from campus governance groups such as the Committee on Mission and Priorities and the Inclusion Counsel. \n \n Q: Will Smith be implementing the recommendations in the report? \n \n A: Smith is carefully considering the recommendations in the report and looks forward to input from the affected parties and the community to fully assess which additional steps are appropriate. \n \n Q: What is the employment status of the staff member who called campus police? \n \n A: The report concluded that no employees violated Smith College policies. Therefore, the college does not anticipate pursuing any adverse employment action in connection with the events of July 31. However, the report has identified certain areas for improvement in Smith\u2019s training for employees, including on encounters with people on campus who may appear to be unfamiliar or out of place. Smith is assessing potential enhancements to its staff trainings to address concerns about the influence of implicit bias in this area. \n \n Q: What information has been redacted from the investigative report? \n \n A: The substance and findings of the independent investigation have not been changed or redacted. The college has, however, redacted certain language to preserve confidentiality consistent with college policy, relating to those interviewed in the investigation. \n \n Q: Have any lawsuits been filed in relation to the July 31 incident? \n \n A: No. \n \n Q: What is the nature of the ACLU\u2019s involvement? \n \n A: Although no lawsuits have been filed, an ACLU attorney is providing counsel to the student and has been in communication with the college since late August. \n \n Q: Social media posts from August 21 purport to identify the caller to Campus Police. Are the posts accurate? \n \n A: No. Neither of the individuals named in these posts placed the call. \n \n Q: Who led the external investigation of the incident? \n \n A: Two experienced attorneys investigated the incident: Anthony Cruthird and Kate Upatham. \n \n Anthony Cruthird has close to 20 years of experience in the field of civil rights and education. The bulk of his experience stems from his prior role as a senior civil rights attorney and team leader with the United States Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR), where his work centered on investigating and remedying complaints alleging discrimination on the bases of race, color, national origin, disability, sex, and age. \n \n Kate Upatham worked for eight years as a Civil Rights Attorney with the U.S. Department of Education, Office for Civil Rights (OCR). She has conducted numerous investigations including with OCR\u2019s compliance team that proactively ensures that schools receiving Federal financial assistance from the U.S. Department of Education, and public entities, are in compliance with the laws enforced by OCR. \n \n Both attorneys are members of the Sanghavi Law Office. \n \n Q: What type of training do Campus Police officers receive? \n \n A: Campus Police officers receive training including, but not limited to: \n \n Diversity, equity and inclusion \n \n Implicit bias (led by the District Attorney\u2019s Office) \n \n Trauma-informed victim response \n \n Violence prevention and de-escalation \n \n Massachusetts State Police training plus an additional nine-week in-house field training \n \n Q: Are college employees required to take anti-bias training? \n \n A: Yes. Please read President McCartney\u2019s October 20, 2018 email to the community regarding employee diversity and bias training. \n \n Q: Does Smith outsource its security to the Northampton Police Department or any other armed police department? \n \n A: No. Campus Police officers respond to all on-campus calls, 24 hours a day, 365 days per year. Campus Police may contact the Northampton Police Department for additional support only in those instances where required\u2014large events, major crimes, etc. \n \n Q: Are Campus Police officers armed? \n \n A: No. Campus Police officers do not carry firearms. \n \n Q: Was there a call to 911? \n \n A: No. The caller contacted Smith College's Campus Police dispatch. \n \n Q: Is there a police report available of the July 31 call to campus police? \n \n A: A Community Incident Report was filed recording the Campus Police officer\u2019s response to the call. The Community Incident Report is included as an exhibit to the investigative report.",

(AP) \u2014 The headmaster of a Connecticut high school has apologized after its football team named one of its plays \"Hitler.\" \n \n Chris Winters, of Greenwich High School, issued the apology Friday. He called the designation offensive and said the practice has been stopped. \n \n A Trumbull mother tells the Connecticut Post (http://bit.ly/2denmBG ) her son's freshman football team was playing Greenwich on Thursday when the players charged onto the field shouting \"Hitler.\" Debbie Levison said the signal for the play was an index finger laid across the upper lip. \n \n The football team and coaches met with the Connecticut Anti-Defamation League to make sure they understand why it was offensive. \n \n The group's executive director told the newspaper he did not see intent to intimidate or anti-Semitism. He called it a teaching moment. \n \n ___ \n \n Information from: Connecticut Post, http://www.connpost.com ||||| Greenwich football players called out for \u201cHitler\u201d play \n \n The Greenwich High School Cardinal logo can be seen in the center of the field at the high school's Cardinal Stadium, Conn The Greenwich High School Cardinal logo can be seen in the center of the field at the high school's Cardinal Stadium, Conn Photo: Bob Luckey Jr. / Hearst Connecticut Media Buy photo Photo: Bob Luckey Jr. / Hearst Connecticut Media Image 1 of / 4 Caption Close Greenwich football players called out for \u201cHitler\u201d play 1 / 4 Back to Gallery \n \n A Trumbull mom couldn\u2019t believe what she heard when her son\u2019s freshman football team played Greenwich Thursday \u2014 players charged onto the field shouting \u201cHitler.\u201d \n \n The war cry was in reference to a play they were about to execute. The signal for the play is an index finger laid across the upper lip. \n \n \u201cMy grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins perished at the hands of Hitler,\u201d Debbie Levison said on Friday. \u201cMy father and mother suffered unspeakable atrocities during the Holocaust. So yes, I\u2019m outraged.\u201d \n \n Levison said her son came off the field visibly angered. When he told her why, she approached some Greenwich players after the game to make sure he had heard correctly. They told her to talk to the coach, which she did. \n \n \u201cCoach James Briggs looked me in the eye and confirmed that they do indeed use a play called Hitler,\u201d Levison said. \u201cI repeated it back to him twice to verify that we were being utterly accurate.\u201d \n \n Levinson said he didn\u2019t even look abashed. \n \n The play apparently is not something that started this year. It has reportedly been used for years, as has a play called \u201cthe Stalin,\u201d according to several sources, including officials from the Anti-Defamation League, who met with GHS players and coaches Friday. \n \n Levison said she can\u2019t understand why other adults who heard it in the past didn\u2019t think to object. \n \n Selectman Drew Marzullo said Friday it doesn\u2019t matter if the play has been used \u201cfor two minutes or two years.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt represents a failure of some to impart the gravity that words such as this one represent evil and should never be spoken in jest on the ball field,\u201d he said. \n \n A letter of apology from Headmaster Chris Winters was posted Friday afternoon on the district website to both the Greenwich and Trumbull communities \u201cfor this admittedly offensive practice.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis practice has been stopped,\u201d Winters said in the message, which reportedly is also being sent home to Greenwich High School parents. \n \n Greenwich school officials also reached out to the local Jewish community to express their apology. \n \n Rabbi Mitchell M. Hurvitz of Temple Sholom on Friday referred to the high school\u2019s Athletic Code of Conduct, which sets appropriate behaviors for student athletes to follow. They include: providing a positive image; respecting the rights of opponents and spectators; representing team, school and town with dignity. \n \n \u201cThis incident was an overt failure of the Code of Conduct,\u201d he said. \n \n But Hurvitz applauded Winters for being \u201cextremely proactive\u201d in responding to the problem, including by reaching out to the Anti-Defamation League. \n \n \u201cWe should accept Chris\u2019 apology on behalf of the Greenwich community,\u201d Hurvitz said. \u201cAnd, we should follow up our remorse with a renewed collective dedication to assure that we all are leading lives consistent to our own dedication to living up to our potential goodness as human beings.\u201d \n \n Steve Ginsburg, executive director of the Connecticut ADL, said he views the use of Hitler\u2019s name as a teaching moment. \n \n \u201cThis is a situation where education is needed,\u201d Ginsburg said. \u201cThere was a lack of understanding. This is not a situation where there was any intent to intimidate, or anti-Semitism or anything like that.\u201d \n \n Ginsburg said the ADL works with a lot of schools around the state. \n \n \u201cNobody takes the work we do more seriously than Greenwich High School,\u201d he said. \n \n Greenwich Reform Synagogue Rabbi Andrew Sklarz said it is the responsibility of adults, including coaches, to educate young people about events like the Holocaust that happened so many years before they were born. \n \n \u201cAnything like this is disheartening,\u201d Sklarz said. \u201cOn Yom Kippur I talked about the death of Eli Wiesel and how important it is to remember what happened to six million Jews and countless others. It\u2019s a story that needs to be retold and passed down through the generations because if you don\u2019t people start to forget and don\u2019t feel the full impact. \n \n \u201cAnything that aims to either glamorize or use something as horrible as Hitler or the Holocaust as an icon is just disheartening,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s something we can\u2019t accept in sports or from students who are supposed to be leaders in the community.\u201d \n \n Levison said she received calls from the headmaster and athletic director apologizing and said they seemed sincere. \n \n \u201cI am not out to punish anyone or embarrass anyone, but rather educate,\u201d Levison said. \u201cI think this is symptomatic of the general blurring of lines in our country of what is right and what is wrong.\u201d \n \n Thursday\u2019s game was played one day after Yom Kippur, the most holy day on the Jewish calendar. \n \n \u201cThis isn\u2019t about me as a Jew speaking out because I happen to have a sensitive context,\u201d she said. \u201cI would hope that every educator and every parent in Greenwich who hears about it is equally appalled. I hope that they say with a clear voice that they will not condone it.\u201d",

(Photo: YouTube) Story Highlights Special Police Officer Richard Recine is under investigation for remarks about Obama, Constitution. \n \n Video recorded by residents campaigning for animal shelter reform. \n \n UPDATE: N.J. cop in Obama rant resigns after video goes viral \n \n EDITOR'S NOTE: This article contains language that some readers may find offensive. \n \n A borough police officer was caught on camera telling a resident that police don't have to follow the Constitution because President Barack Obama doesn't, either. \n \n Special Police Officer Richard Recine now is the subject of an internal affairs investigation after the video was posted online and was seen by Police Director Robert Manney, who called the comments an \"embarrassment.\" \n \n In the video, taken Monday at the borough municipal building, resident Steve Wronko gets into a verbal confrontation with Recine, who was called to the building because Wronko was seen taking pictures inside. \n \n After Wronko insists he has a constitutional right to record in a public place, Recine responds. \n \n \"Obama has decimated the friggin' constitution, so I don't give a damn,\" says Recine, a retired Franklin cop. \"Because if he doesn't follow the Constitution we don't have to.\" \n \n Wronko then turns to the person recording the camera to make sure that was recorded. Recine repeats himself. \n \n \"Our president has decimated the constitution, then we don't have to.\" \n \n On Wednesday, Manney said Recine's words were \"uncalled for and unprofessional.\" \n \n Manney, who appears in the video but only after Recine had made his comments, said the investigation should be \"completed very swiftly\" because \"the evidence is right there.\" \n \n \"I've already spoken to that officer in regards to that. In my opinion it's an embarrassment.\" \n \n Recine works as a part-time special police officer earning an hourly wage while collecting a $79,000 annual pension for his retirement as a police officer from Franklin in 2006. Helmetta is a small town of less than 2,200 people known for its police speed trap along the main drag. \n \n Wronko's wife said Wednesday that she and her husband were at the municipal building to file public record requests. The couple have been campaigning for reform at the borough animal shelter, which they said gave them an underage and sick puppy that caused them thousands of dollars in veterinarian bills. \n \n \"We wanted them to pay for the medical bills. Now it's way past the money,\" Collene Freda-Wronko said. \"Now it's about getting animals out of that shelter and getting people into that shelter who could run that facility better.\" \n \n She said police have ordered her husband to stop videorecording at the animal shelter during two previous incidents. \n \n Manney said police have the right to ask citizens to identify themselves in a municipal building. \n \n \"He was in our building and he got some of our employees upset,\" he said about Wronko. \"They were worried because they've seen him before lurking around. In my opinion he was looking for an issue.\" \n \n Staff Writer Sergio Bichao: 908-243-6615; sbichao@mycentraljersey.com \n \n Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1scydwb",

    "document": "Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \n \n How easy would it be for a thief to guess your four-digit PIN? If he were forced to guess randomly, his odds of getting the correct number would be one in 10,000\u2014or, if he has three tries, one in 3,333. But if you were careless enough to choose your birth date, a year in the 1900s, or an obvious numerical sequence, his chances go up. Way up. \n \n \n \n Will Oremus Will Oremus is Slate\u2019s senior technology writer. Email him at will.oremus@slate.com or follow him on Twitter. \n \n Researchers at the data analysis firm Data Genetics have found that the three most popular combinations\u2014\"1234,\" \"1111,\" and \"0000\"\u2014account for close to 20 percent of all four-digit passwords. Meanwhile, every four-digit combination that starts with \"19\" ranks above the 80th percentile in popularity, with those in the late\u2014er, upper\u20141900s coming in the highest. Also quite common are MM/DD combinations\u2014those in which the first two digits are between \"01\" and \"12\" and the last two are between \"01\" and \"31.\" So choosing your birthday, your birth year, or a number that might be a lot of other people's birthday or birth year makes your password significantly easier to guess. \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n On the other end of the scale, the least popular combination\u20148068\u2014appears less than 0.001 percent of the time. (Although, as Data Genetics acknowledges, you probably shouldn't go out and choose \"8068\" now that this is public information.) Rounding out the bottom five are \"8093,\" \"9629,\" \"6835,\" and \"7637,\" which all nearly as rare. \n \n \n \n Data Genetics came up with the numbers by analyzing a database of 3.4 million stolen passwords that have been made public over the years. Most of these are passwords for websites. But by looking specifically at those that comprise exactly four characters, all of which are numerals, the researchers figured they could get a decent proxy for ATM PINs as well. \n \n One would hope, of course, that fewer people choose \"1234\" to protect their checking accounts than to log in to random websites. But Data Genetics found some circumstantial evidence to support its hypothesis that there are some strong correlations between the two. For instance, the combination \"2580\" was the 22nd-most popular in their data set. Why so high? Probably because those four numbers appear in a single column from top to bottom on a phone or ATM keypad. On most computer keyboards, they do not. \n \n Some other interesting anedcotes from the data: \n \n Half of all passwords are among the 426 most popular (out of 10,000 total). \n \n \n \n People prefer even numbers to odd, so \"2468\" ranks higher than \"1357.\" \n \n Far more passwords start with \"1\" than any other number. In a distant second and third are \"0\" and \"2.\" \n \n Among seven-digit passwords, the fourth-most popular is \"8675309,\" which should ring familiar to fans of '80s music. \n \n \n \n The 17th-most popular 10-digit password is \"3141592654.\" \n \n \n \n Two-digit sequences with large numerical gaps, such as \"29\" and \"37,\" are found often among the least popular passwords. ||||| PIN analysis \n \n A good friend of mine, Ian, recently forwarded me an internet joke. The headline was something like: \u201cAll credit card PIN numbers in the World leaked\u201d The body of the message simply said 0000 0001 0002 0003 0004 \u2026 \n \n Ian\u2019s messages made me chuckle. Then, later the same day, I read this XKCD cartoon. The merging of these two humorous topics created the seed for this article. \n \n I love Randall\u2019s work. My favorite, to date, is this one. I have a signed copy of it on my office wall. Like many of his creations, this cartoon is excellent at bifurcating readers; people read it, then either smile and chuckle, or stare blankly at it followed by a \u201cHuh? I don\u2019t get it!\u201d comment. Then you explain it, and get a reply \u201cYeeaaaaaa\u2026no, I still don\u2019t get it!\u201d Esoteric humor in action. You can be cool and buy his signed artwork too. \n \n What is the least common PIN number? \n \n There are 10,000 possible combinations that the digits 0-9 can be arranged to form a 4-digit pin code. Out of these ten thousand codes, which is the least commonly used? Which of these pin codes is the least predictable? Which of these pin codes is the most predictable? If you were given the task of trying to crack a random credit card by repeatedly trying PIN codes, what order should you try guessing to maximize your chances of selecting the correct number in the shortest time? \n \n If you had to make predication about what the least commonly used 4-digit PIN is, what would be your guess? \n \n This tangentially relates to the XKCD cartoon. In Randall\u2019s cartoon, the perpetrator\u2019s plan backfired because his selected license plate was so unique that it was very memorable. What is the least memorable license plate? Ask any spy you know (snigger) what the best way to blend into a crowd is. Their answer will be not stand out, to appear \u201cnormal\u201d, and not be notable in any way. \n \n People are notoriously bad at generating random passwords. I hope this article will scare you into being a little more careful in how you select your next PIN number. Are you curious about what the least commonly used PIN number might be? How about the most popular? Read on \u2026 \n \n DISCLAIMER \n \n This article is not intended to be a hacker bible, or to be used as a utility, resource, or tool to help would-be thieves perform nefarious actions. I will only disclose data sufficient to make my points, and will try to avoid giving specific data outside of the obvious examples. I do not want to be an enabler for script-kiddies. Please do not email me asking for the database I used; if you do, you will be wasting your time as I\u2019m not going to respond. I\u2019m not going to sell, donate or release the source data \u2013 don\u2019t ask! \n \n Source \n \n Obviously, I don\u2019t have access to a credit card PIN number database. Instead I\u2019m going to use a proxy. I\u2019m going to use data condensed from released/exposed/discovered password tables and security breaches. \n \n Soap Box \u2013 Password Database Exposures \n \n Over the years, there have been numerous password table security breaches: Some very high profile, some low profile, but all embarrassing (and many exceedingly expensive; both in direct fines and indirect loss of business through erosion of trust and reputation). Fool me once, well, no, even that\u2019s not really acceptable, but fool me twice \u2026 I\u2019ll go even further: Any developer who stores the password table of their database in clear text should be so mortified by this lack of security that they should not be sleeping at night until they fix it. Ignoring the fact that you should never have ever coded it this way, you have an obligation to learn from these past breaches. If you work for a company and are knowledgeable that your customer database is \u201cprotected\u201d by such lightweight security then run, don\u2019t walk, to your CEO/Presidents office, pound on the door and insist (s)he puts out a mandate to fix the matter with extreme prejudice. Don\u2019t leave until you get an affirmative response. Badger, badger then badger them again. Make yourself a proverbial thorn in their side. \n \n I\u2019m not trying to sell my services as a consultant here (though if you are interested, my rates are very reasonable compared to the cost of legal defense, potential FTC sanctions, class action suits, shareholder backlash, fines, loss of reputation and business \u2026) There are plenty of security experts in the industry who can help you (if you need help filtering them and don\u2019t have referrals, someone who has CISSP qualifications is a good place to start). \n \n Bottom line Security strengthens with layers, and the simple application of encryption on your database table can help protect your customer\u2019s data if this table is exposed. It does not defend against all possible attacks, but it does nothing but good things. What possible reason is there store things in clear-text? \n \n Back to the data \n \n By combining the exposed password databases I\u2019ve encountered, and filtering the results to just those rows that are exactly four digits long [0-9] the output is a database of all the four digit character combinations that people have used as their account passwords. \n \n Given that users have a free choice for their password, if users select a four digit password to their online account, it\u2019s not a stretch to use this as a proxy for four digit PIN codes. \n \n The Data \n \n I was able to find almost 3.4 million four digit passwords. Every single one of the of the 10,000 combinations of digits from 0000 through to 9999 were represented in the dataset. \n \n The most popular password is 1234 \u2026 \n \n \u2026 it\u2019s staggering how popular this password appears to be. Utterly staggering at the lack of imagination \u2026 \n \n \u2026 nearly 11% of the 3.4 million passwords are 1234 !!! \n \n The next most popular 4-digit PIN in use is 1111 with over 6% of passwords being this. In third place is 0000 with almost 2%. A table of the top 20 found passwords in shown at the right. A staggering 26.83% of all passwords could be guessed by attempting these 20 combinations! (Statistically, with 10,000 possible combination, if passwords were uniformly randomly distributed, we would expect the these twenty passwords to account for just 0.2% of the total, not the 26.83% encountered) Looking more closely at the top few records, all the usual suspects are present 1111 2222 3333 \u2026 9999 as well as 1212 and (snigger) 6969 . It\u2019s not a surprise to see patterns like 1122 and 1313 occurring high up in the list, nor 4321 or 1010 . 2001 makes an appearance at #19. 1984 follows not far behind in position #26, and James Bond fans may be interested to know 0007 is found between the two of them in position #23 (another variant 0070 follows not much further behind at #28). PIN Freq #1 1234 10.713% #2 1111 6.016% #3 0000 1.881% #4 1212 1.197% #5 7777 0.745% #6 1004 0.616% #7 2000 0.613% #8 4444 0.526% #9 2222 0.516% #10 6969 0.512% #11 9999 0.451% #12 3333 0.419% #13 5555 0.395% #14 6666 0.391% #15 1122 0.366% #16 1313 0.304% #17 8888 0.303% #18 4321 0.293% #19 2001 0.290% #20 1010 0.285% \n \n The first \u201cpuzzling\u201d password I encountered was 2580 in position #22. What is the significance of these digits? Why should so many people select this code to make it appear so high up the list? \n \n Then I realized that 2580 is a straight down the middle of a telephone keypad! (Interestingly, this is very compelling evidence confirming the hypothesis that a 4-digit password list is a great proxy for a PIN number database. If you look at the numeric keypad on a PC-keyboard you\u2019ll see that 2580 is slightly more awkward to type on the PC than a phone because the order of keys on a keyboard is the inverted. Cash machines and other terminals that take credit cards use a phone style numeric pads. It appears that many people have an easy to type/remember PIN number for their credit card and are re-using the same four digits for their online passwords, where the \"straight down the middle\" mnemonic no longer applies). \n \n (Another fascinating piece of trivia is that people seem to prefer even numbers over odd, and codes like 2468 occur higher than a odd number equivalent, such as 1357 ). \n \n Cumulative Frequency \n \n As noted above, the more popular password selections dominate the frequency tables. The most popular PIN code of 1234 is more popular than the lowest 4,200 codes combined! \n \n That's right, you might be able to crack over 10% of all codes with one guess! Expanding this, you could get 20% by using just five numbers! \n \n Below is a cumulative frequency graph: \n \n Statistically, one third of all codes can be guessed by trying just 61 distinct combinations! \n \n The 50% cumulative chance threshold is passed at just 426 codes (far less than the 5,000 that a random uniformly distribution would predict). Paranoid yet? \n \n Bottom of the pile \n \n OK, we've investigated most frequently used PINS and found they tend to be predictable and easy to remember, let's turn for a second to the bottom of the pile. What are the least \"interesting\" (least used) PINS? In my dataset the answer is 8068 with just 25 occurrences in 3.4 million (this equates to 0.000744%, far, far fewer than random distribution would predict, and five orders of magnitude behind the most popular choice). To the right are the twenty least popular 4-digit passwords encountered. Warning Now that we\u2019ve learned that, historically, 8068 is (was?) the least commonly used password 4-digit PIN, please don\u2019t go out and change yours to this! Hackers can read too! They will also be promoting 8068 up their attempt trees in order to catch people who read this (or similar) articles. Check out about the Nash Equilibrium PIN Freq #9980 8557 0.001191% #9981 9047 0.001161% #9982 8438 0.001161% #9983 0439 0.001161% #9984 9539 0.001161% #9985 8196 0.001131% #9986 7063 0.001131% #9987 6093 0.001131% #9988 6827 0.001101% #9989 7394 0.001101% #9990 0859 0.001072% #9991 8957 0.001042% #9992 9480 0.001042% #9993 6793 0.001012% #9994 8398 0.000982% #9995 0738 0.000982% #9996 7637 0.000953% #9997 6835 0.000953% #9998 9629 0.000953% #9999 8093 0.000893% #10000 8068 0.000744% \n \n Memorable Years \n \n Many of the high frequency PIN numbers can be interpreted as years, e.g. 1967 1956 1937 \u2026 It appears that many people use a year of birth (or possibly an anniversary) as their PIN. This will certainly help them remember their code, but it greatly increases its predictability. \n \n Just look at the stats: Every single 19?? combination can be found in the top fifth of the dataset! \n \n Below is a plot of this in graphical format. In this chart, each yellow line represents a PIN number that starts 19?? \n \n If all the passwords were uniformly distributed, there should be no significant difference between the frequency of occurrence of, for instance, 1972 and any other PIN ending in seventy two ??72 . However, as we shall see, this is not the case at all. \n \n 1972 occurs in ordinal position #76 (with a frequency 0.099363%). Here\u2019s a histogram for the occurrences of all ??72 probabilities. \n \n You can clearly see the spike at 1972 (with smaller spikes at 7272 and 1472 ) \n \n If you calculate the ratio of the peak of 1972 to the average of all the other ??72 PINS you get the ratio of 22:1 \n \n PINS starting with 19?? are much more likley to occur. Of course, it\u2019s not just 1972. Here is plot of the ratio of 19 to non-19 for all hundred combinations. Along the x-axis are all the combinations of last two digits \u2013XX, and for each of these the ratio of the 19XX to average of all the other ??XX occurrences has been calculated. Here\u2019s the chart: \n \n It's a pretty good approximation for a demographic chart! (suggested by the red-dashed trend line) which would probably allow a fair estimation of the ages (years of birth) of the people using the various websites. (Of course, hackers invert this strategy and use the age of a target to try and give information to guess a user's PIN. Looking at this graph, this might give them up to a 40x advantage!) \n \n Just about all the ratios are above 1.0 . The noteable exceptions are ??34 and ??00 (which are easy to explain, since the massive popularity of 1234 and 0000 dwarf 1934 and 1900 respectively). Simiarly 33 44 55 66 \u2026 are lower than expected as the quad codes like 3333 mask out even the 1933 boost. \n \n There are also spikes in the graph corresponding to the popular PINS of 1919 1984 and 1999 \n \n Patterns in data \n \n I love pretty ways to graphically vizualize data. Pictures really do paint thousands of words. Another interesting way to visualize the PIN data is in this grid plot of the distribution. In this heatmap, the x-axis depicts the left two digits from [00] to [99] and the y-axis depicts the right two digits from [00] to [99] . The bottom left is 0000 and the top right is 9999 . Color is used to represent frequency. The higher frequency occurences are yellow to white hot, and the lower frequency occurences are red, through dark red to black. Geek Note The scaling is logarithmic. \n \n You could look at this plot all day! \n \n The bright line for the leading diagonal shows the repeated couplets that people love to use for their PIN numbers 0000 0101 0202 \u2026 5454 5555 5656 \u2026 9898 9999 . \n \n Every eleventh dot on the leading diagonal is brighter corresponding to the quad numbers e.g. 4444 5555 . Here is a larger scale version: \n \n Interesting things \n \n There are so many interesting things to learn from this heatmap. Here are just a couple: \n \n The first is the interesting harmonics of shading (seen here more easily in a gray scale plot). You can make out a \u201cgrid pattern\u201d in the plot. The lighter areas corresponding to couplets of numbers that are close to each other. For some reason, people don't like to select pairs of numbers that have larger numerical gaps between them. Combinations like 45 and 67 occur much more frequently than things like 29 and 37 Here we see the line corresponding to 19XX . The intensity the dots relates to the chart we plotted earlier There are a large number of codes starting with 19, especially towards the higher end. There is a strong bias towards the lower left quadrant. People love to start their PIN numbers with 0 , and even more so with the digit 1 . The chart on the right shows the relative frequency of the first digit of 4-digit pin codes. As you can see, the digit 1 dominates (and it's not all down to the 19XX phenomenon.) Little bright specs dot the plot in places corresponding to numerical runs (both ascending and descending) such as 2345 , 4321 and 5678 . I've highlighted just a couple on the plot to the left.

All the usual suspects occur, but a new addition is the puerile addition in position #20 of the concatenation of 420 and 69. \n \n For six digit password, again 696969 appears highly. Also of note is 159753 (a \"X\" mark over the numeric keypad). James Bond returns with 007007. \n \n For seven digits, the standby of 1234567 is a much lower frequency (though still the top). I speculate that this is because many people may be using their telephone number (without area code) as a seven digit password. Telephone numbers are fairly distinct, and already memorized, so when a seven digit code is needed, they spring to mind easily. The higher frequency of usage of telephone numbers reduces the need to use imagination (or lack thereof) and select something else. \n \n Is Jenny there? The fouth most popular seven digit password is 8675309 (It's a popular 80's song). \n \n Eight digit passwords are just as expected. Lots of pattern, and lots of repetition. \n \n Common nine digit passwords also follow patterns and repetition. 789456123 appears as an easy \"Along the top, middle and bottom of the keypad\" 147258369 is related in the vertical direction (and other variants appear high up). Again we get a 420 moment with 420420420, and also the shaken, not stirred, but repeated 007007007 returns. \n \n Interestingly for ten digits 1029384756 appears (alternating ascending/descending digits), as well as the odd/even 1357924680. \n \n Hurrah for math! In position #17 of the ten digit password list we get 3141592654 (The first few digits of Pi) \n \n Conclusions \n \n If you are a developer , tester or executive I hope you are sufficiently paranoid that you will immediately check to see that your systems do not store sensitive information, like passwords, unencrypted. The entire reason I was able to perform this analysis is because dumb stupid and lazy coders stored information in clear text. Your lazyness has the potential to impact millions. If you are a consumer and your recognize any of the numbers I've used in this article to be your passwords/pins I hope you apply common sense and immediately change them to something a little less predictable. Alternatively, you could be lazy and not change things (In that case, at least the only person you are harming with this apathy is yourself.) \n \n Updates \n \n Since publishing this article, it's been brought to my attention that, of course, in addition to anniversary years, many people encapsulate dates in the format MMDD (such as birthdays \u2026) for their PIN codes. \n \n This clearly explains the lower left corner where, if you look at the heatmap, there is a huge contrast change at the height of around 30-31 (the number of days in a month), extending to 12 on the x-axis. (Thanks to zero79 for first pointing this out). \n \n Many people also asked the significance of 1004 in the four character PIN table. This comes from Korean speakers. When spoken, \"1004\" is cheonsa (cheon = 1000, sa=4). \n \n \"Cheonsa\" also happens to be the Korean word for Angel. \n \n Another XKCD cartoon \n \n It only seems appropriate to end with another XKCD cartoon.

    "document": "WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- After months of efforts to craft a bipartisan bill, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd plans to introduce a revised version of sweeping bank reform legislation on Monday, most likely without Republican support. \n \n Dodd had hoped to release a bipartisan bill, after working furiously with Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., to reach a solution. However, Dodd said that time was running out to pass a bill in 2010. \n \n \"There isn't a lot of time left to complete bank reform this year,\" Dodd said to reporters at a news conference. \"The real problem I'm facing is that clock.\" \n \n At a separate news conference, a visibly disappointed Corker said that he and Dodd, along with other members of the committee, were extremely close to completing a bipartisan bill, coming to agreements on dozens of controversial areas such as how much power to award a new regulator for consumer protection of mortgage and credit card products. \n \n Corker said the lawmakers had been \"on the five-yard line\" when it came to completing the reform, but that Dodd told him he was under pressure by the White House to wrap up efforts to complete bank reform quickly in the committee so that Congress can take steps it needs to pass health care legislation, also languishing on Capitol Hill. \n \n \"There is no question that White House politics and health care have kept us from getting to the goal line,\" Corker said to reporters. \"The fact of the matter is, he is a victim of health care policy. We're still almost there but it looks like we're not going to get there.\" \n \n Dodd plans to have the 22 senators on the committee vote on the bill during the week of March 22, after which it could be quickly considered on the Senate floor some time in the Spring. \n \n Not enough time? \n \n In his news conference, Corker also criticized Dodd's plan to have the banking committee begin and complete its review of the bank bill in one week. \n \n \"This is a very important bill and I cannot imagine a committee member, Republican or Democrat, passing a bill with this kind of substance in it in a week,\" Corker said. \"I think that would be a travesty. If senators can pass a bill of this substance in a week, which has so much in it, then the states that elect them might as well send robots to Washington.\" \n \n In response, Dodd said that he needs to set time-posts, otherwise nothing would get done. He acknowledged, however that his timeline of having members of the committee vote on the bill in a week, could slip. \"It is more important to get this right than getting it done but I emphasize again, I don't have a lot of time left in this Congress.\" \n \n However, Corker said Dodd, Republicans and Democrats had agreed to a number of areas, including a new structure for a consumer protection division, new heightened liability for credit raters and additional oversight for payday lenders and other lenders. \n \n Dodd and other Democrats have sought to create a powerful consumer financial protection agency that could write rules for mortgages and credit cards. However, Republicans have sought to have a bank regulator have veto power over any rules the new consumer advocate would write. \n \n Corker said Dodd and he had come to an agreement to allow a group of five agencies, the Treasury, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Fed, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, have veto power over consumer rules the division would write if a majority of the agencies agreed it was a problematic rule. \n \n Both sides also agreed to let bank regulators enforce the rules put in place by the consumer unit. \n \n \"We have come to a very good balance,\" Corker said. \n \n However, Dodd declined to comment about whether it was that structure he would ultimately agree to. Dodd also denied reports assertions that he might try to split the bill into two pieces and first move forward on portions he could find broad consensus on. \n \n \"To do this in pieces would be impossible in the Senate,\" Dodd said. \n \n Disagreements still abound \n \n Republicans and Democrats on the committee disagree on a number of other areas. \n \n Case in point: Dodd and other Democrats have installed a series of shareholder empowering provisions in the bank reform bill that Corker and others are opposed to. \n \n \"That's a line in the sand,\" Corker said. \n \n The bill is expected to include provisions that would make it easier for investors to nominate a minority slate of directors onto corporate boards using corporate proxy cards, which are papers filed to investors. Another provision gives investors a non-binding vote on pay packages given to executives, while they are heading the corporations, and the golden parachutes they receive when they leave firms. \n \n Republicans are trying to remove all of these measures, arguing they empower labor unions and environmentalist investor groups in behind-the-scenes conversations at the expense of shareholder value. \n \n \"Proxy access was going to be an issue,\" Corker said. \"We agreed to look at some governance issues however this shareholder provision concerns us greatly because it involves giving activist investor groups too much power.\" \n \n Corker also said Sens. Jack Reed, D-R.I., and Judd Gregg, R-N.H., had been still working on crafting bipartisan derivatives legislation before Dodd decided to bring the bill to a vote. The two sides were working on how much of an exemption to give end users of derivatives, such as manufacturers, from transparency and trading requirements. The bill requires that most derivatives transactions go through transparent clearinghouses, which are intermediaries between buyers and sellers. ||||| WASHINGTON\u2014The White House's yearlong effort to rewrite financial regulations risked running aground in the Senate after Democratic Sen. Christopher Dodd broke off bipartisan negotiations and announced plans to push ahead without Republican support. \n \n The gamble is a bid to speed progress, but it raises the chance that Congress won't be able to push through a substantive regulatory overhaul. \n \n The White House and some Senate Democrats now plan to challenge the GOP to a partisan fistfight, daring Republican senators to break ranks and not use the blocking power of a filibuster to kill a measure that would curb Wall Street and ...",

The number of infant deaths initially decreased in the 1990s after a national safe sleep campaign, but has plateaued in recent years.AAP recommendations on creating a safe sleep environment include:Skin-to-skin care is recommended, regardless of feeding or delivery method, immediately following birth for at least an hour as soon as the mother is medically stable and awake, according to the report.Breastfeeding is also recommended as adding protection against SIDS. After feeding, the AAP encourages parents to move the baby to his or her separate sleeping space, preferably a crib or bassinet in the parents' bedroom.\"If you are feeding your baby and think that there's even the slightest possibility that you may fall asleep, feed your baby on your bed, rather than a sofa or cushioned chair,\" said Lori Feldman-Winter, MD, FAAP, member of the Task Force on SIDS and co-author of the report.\"If you do fall asleep, as soon as you wake up be sure to move the baby to his or her own bed,\" she said.\"There should be no pillows, sheets, blankets or other items that could obstruct the infant's breathing or cause overheating.\"While infants are at heightened risk for SIDS between the ages 1 and 4 months, new evidence shows that soft bedding continues to pose hazards to babies who are 4 months and older.Other recommendations include: \n \n The AAP recommends that doctors have open and nonjudgmental conversations with families about their sleep practices. Media outlets and advertisers may also play a role in educating parents by following safe sleep recommendations when presenting images and messages to the public. \n \n \n \n \"We want to share this information in a way that doesn't scare parents but helps to explain the real risks posed by an unsafe sleep environment,\" Dr. Moon said. \"We know that we can keep a baby safer without spending a lot of money on home monitoring gadgets but through simple precautionary measures.\" \n \n \n \n The news conference will be held from 10:15 a.m.- 11 a.m. PST on Oct. 24 in Room 125, Moscone Center North, 730 Howard St, San Francisco, CA 94103.

What could I have done better? Could I have saved him? I will never be able to shake the feeling that there was something more I could have done to prevent his death,\" DeRosier said. \n \n DeRosier made Sloan's cause of death public in a Facebook post, which has since been deleted, with hopes that it would shed light on the dangers of crib blankets. \"That's really the only thing giving us comfort right now. We've gotten thousands of messages from parents saying that after reading about our story, they took blankets out of cribs.\" \n \n But she has also received negative reactions, and has now made her Facebook private. \"More and more people started to say hateful, hurtful things,\" she wrote in her latest post. \"I started getting messages and comments that made me physically sick to read. It is so unfortunate that people think grief should fit their guidelines, that because my child died I cannot talk about him. My son's life mattered. His story matters.\" \n \n ORIGINAL, 7/6/2017: After a tragic accident, one grieving mom is opening up about the dangers of having blankets and other objects in a young child's crib. \n \n Washington mom Jordan DeRosier took to social media to express her emptiness after she suddenly lost her seven-month-old Sloan on July 3. While she originally refrained from posting the cause of death, she shared her heart-wrenching experience after critics began blaming vaccines; Sloan had passed away after getting caught in his blanket overnight. \n \n \"I had not wanted to explain the detailed circumstances of his death because of my guilt and the fear of condemnation from others. But I will not allow anyone to try and place blame where it does not belong,\" she wrote in a Facebook post that has since been deleted. \n \n \"He was last laid down to bed with this blanket made by his great-great grandmother, and one other blanket, a grey one he had been attached to since birth. They took the grey one he had been found with his head in. He had pulled it through the crib rails somehow and gotten himself stuck in it. You never think it will happen to you. You never think it will be your baby.\" \n \n DeRosier finished her message, by urging parents to learn from her \"world-shattering mistake.\" \n \n \"Please do not put your babies to bed with a blanket. Please. He was 7 months old, I thought because he was crawling, standing on his own, and climbing, that he would be fine with a blanket. This is the face of immense, unfathomable grief, the face of longing, of heartbreak, of self inflicted GUILT. I will NEVER stop feeling responsible. I will relive this for the rest of my life knowing EXACTLY what I could have done differently.\" \n \n In a statement to GoodHousekeeping.com, DeRosier said that she hopes Sloan's story educates others about crib safety. \n \n \"Sloan was a light in the life of all who knew him, he was an absolute dream baby. It helps us to know that he is living on in the hearts of people around the world. We have received hundreds of thousand of comments and messages letting us know that his story has already saved the lives of so many other babies. His life was far too short, but his purpose is now so clear,\" she said. \n \n Her words certainly serve as a warning. Approximately 3,500 infants die annually in the United States from sleep-related deaths, including sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); ill-defined deaths; and accidental suffocation and strangulation, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). \n \n The Good Housekeeping Institute's Chief Technologist Rachel Rothman says bare is best when it comes to you baby's crib. \"Nothing should be in the crib except the baby and a tight-fitting firm mattress and fitted sheet,\" she explains. \"Soft objects, loose bedding or any items that could cause entrapment, suffocation or strangulation should be out of the baby's sleep area including pillows, comforters, blankets, toys, bumper pads or anything that attaches to the crib slats.\" \n \n Both Rothman and DeRosier's warnings mirror the AAP's recommendations. They suggest doing the following to create a safe sleep environment for babies: \n \n Place the baby on his or her back on a firm sleep surface such as a crib or bassinet with a tight-fitting sheet. \n \n Avoid use of soft bedding, including crib bumpers, blankets, pillows and soft toys. \n \n Share a bedroom with parents, but not the same sleeping surface, preferably until the baby turns one but at least for the first six months. Room-sharing decreases the risk of SIDS by as much as 50%. \n \n Avoid baby's exposure to smoke, alcohol and illicit drugs.",

    "document": "New safety rules for fraternities at the University of Virginia would require at least three \u201csober and lucid\u201d members to monitor behavior at parties, prohibit pre-mixed alcoholic drinks and implement guest lists to control entry to the houses during an event. \n \n The rules, made public Tuesday, also stipulate that one of the sober party monitors must be posted at a staircase leading to bedrooms and have \u201cimmediate key access to each room\u201d in the house. That measure appears designed to prevent situations that could lead to sexual assault at U-Va\u2019s fraternities. \n \n The safety initiative arose in response to a Rolling Stone magazine article in November that depicted a female student saying she was gang-raped at a fraternity house during her freshman year. That article unraveled last month as key elements of the rape allegation fell into doubt and the magazine\u2019s managing editor apologized for journalistic lapses. \n \n But university officials and leaders of Greek organizations, among others in the U-Va. community, pledged to continue a push to improve safety at U-Va. regardless. \n \n With that in mind, the university unveiled an addendum to its \u201cfraternal organization agreement\u201d with 31 chapters belonging to U-Va.\u2019s Inter-Fraternity Council. Of those, 28 have houses, which are often the scene of parties where alcohol is available. \n \n At the same time, the university released another safety addendum for its agreements with sororities and fraternities that belong to other Greek councils. That document promises steps to promote \u201cbystander intervention\u201d \u2014 a method of preventing sexual violence \u2014 as well as educational programs on alcohol use and safe parties. \n \n On Nov. 22, three days after the Rolling Stone article appeared, U-Va. President Teresa A. Sullivan announced a suspension of social activities for campus Greek organizations. On Tuesday, Sullivan said the suspension would be lifted immediately, on condition that each chapter agree to the new safety provisions by Jan. 16, the second day of fraternity spring rush. \n \n \u201cI believe the new safety measures recommended by the student leaders in the Greek community will help provide a safer environment for their members and guests,\u201d Sullivan said in a statement. \u201cI would like to express my sincere appreciation to our student leaders who have worked so diligently in the past several weeks to bring forth substantive recommendations and improvements consistent with the ideals of our community of trust.\u201d \n \n IFC President Tommy Reid credited numerous fraternity and sorority members, among others, for working \u201caround the clock for the past month and half to develop these improvements to our system.\u201d The council, he said, \u201cis excited for the spring semester and looks forward to continuing to lead the advancement of student safety at the university.\u201d \n \n It is unclear how the new rules for the IFC will change the party culture at Virginia\u2019s flagship public university. J. Marshall Pattie, an associate dean of students, said some of the provisions \u2014 such as sober party monitors \u2014 already have been customary. \n \n Now there will be a standard protocol: At least three \u201csober brothers\u201d on duty at all parties, with more required as needed. At least one monitor must be stationed wherever alcohol is distributed, and at least one must be at the staircase. The monitors also must wear something that identifies them \u2014 with the identification common for all chapters. \n \n On alcohol, the rules say that beer can be served in unopened cans and that wine can be served if visibly poured by a sober fraternity member. Prohibited are \u201cpre-mixed drinks, punches or any other common source of alcohol.\u201d That means no beer kegs. Hard liquor can be served at large events if a fraternity hires a bartender through a company with a state license, or at smaller events if bottles are placed at a bar overseen by a sober monitor. \n \n The documents released Tuesday make scant mention of laws against serving alcohol to people under the age of 21. Underlying the rules there appears to be an assumption that college students will drink at parties, regardless of the law, and that the university should try to make those parties as safe as possible. \n \n On guest lists, Pattie said fraternities often have had such controls but that enforcement has varied. Sometimes, he said, a fraternity member might have asked a brother to wave somebody into a party who was not on the list. The new rules will call for a hired security agent to be stationed at the door during large parties to check guest lists. At smaller parties, a fraternity member will check the list. \n \n These provisions are described in a section of the rules headlined, \u201cEliminating discomfort and chaos: Entry management.\u201d ||||| CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) \u2014 University of Virginia President Teresa A. Sullivan says fraternities and sororities are being allowed to reinstate social activities, provided they agree to new safety practices. \n \n The Greek system at U.Va. came under scrutiny after Rolling Stone magazine reported on an alleged gang rape at a fraternity house in 2012. The magazine has since apologized for what it calls discrepancies in details of the account. \n \n In a statement issued Tuesday, Sullivan said she approved additions to the university's Fraternal Organization Agreement. \n \n Sullivan said the changes will enhance the safety of fraternity and sorority members, as well as guests. One change: no pre-mixed drinks at fraternity parties and all fraternity functions must have security monitoring the front door. \n \n Sullivan suspended social activities until Jan. 9 after the Rolling Stone article was published. ||||| Last month, Rolling Stone published a story entitled A Rape on Campus, which described a brutal gang rape of a woman named Jackie during a party at a University of Virginia fraternity house, the University's failure to respond to this alleged assault \u2013 and the school's troubling history of indifference to many other instances of alleged sexual assaults. The story generated worldwide headlines and much soul-searching at UVA. University president Teresa Sullivan promised a full investigation and also to examine the way the school investigates sexual assault allegations. \n \n Because of the sensitive nature of Jackie's story, we decided to honor her request not to contact the man who she claimed orchestrated the attack on her nor any of the men who she claimed participated in the attack for fear of retaliation against her. In the months Sabrina Rubin Erdely reported the story, Jackie said or did nothing that made her, or Rolling Stone's editors and fact-checkers, question her credibility. Jackie\u2019s friends and rape activists on campus strongly supported her account. She had spoken of the assault in campus forums. We reached out to both the local branch and the national leadership of Phi Psi, the fraternity where Jackie said she was attacked. They responded that they couldn\u2019t confirm or deny her story but that they had questions about the evidence. \n \n In the face of new information reported by the Washington Post and other news outlets, there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account. The fraternity has issued a formal statement denying the assault and asserting that there was no \"date function or formal event\" on the night in question. Jackie herself is now unsure if the man she says lured her into the room where the rape occurred, identified in the story as \"Drew,\" was a Phi Psi brother. According to the Washington Post, \"Drew\" actually belongs to a different fraternity and when contacted by the paper, he denied knowing Jackie. Jackie told Rolling Stone that after she was assaulted, she ran into \"Drew\" at a UVA pool where they both worked as lifeguards. In its statement, Phi Psi says none of its members worked at the pool in the fall of 2012. A friend of Jackie\u2019s (who we were told would not speak to Rolling Stone) told the Washington Post that he found Jackie that night a mile from the school's fraternities. She did not appear to be \"physically injured at the time\" but was shaken. She told him that that she had been forced to have oral sex with a group of men at a fraternity party, but he does not remember her identifying a specific house. Other friends of Jackie\u2019s told the Washington Post that they now have doubts about her narrative, but Jackie told the Washington Post that she firmly stands by the account she gave to Erdely. \n \n We published the article with the firm belief that it was accurate. Given all of these reports, however, we have come to the conclusion that we were mistaken in honoring Jackie's request to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account. In trying to be sensitive to the unfair shame and humiliation many women feel after a sexual assault, we made a judgment \u2013 the kind of judgment reporters and editors make every day. We should have not made this agreement with Jackie and we should have worked harder to convince her that the truth would have been better served by getting the other side of the story. These mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie. We apologize to anyone who was affected by the story and we will continue to investigate the events of that evening. \n \n Will Dana \n \n Managing Editor \n \n From Rugby Road to Vinegar Hill, we're gonna get drunk tonight \n \n The faculty's afraid of us, they know we're in the right \n \n So fill up your cups, your loving cups, as full as full can be \n \n As long as love and liquor last, we'll drink to the U of V \n \n \u2014\"Rugby Road,\" traditional University of Virginia fight song \n \n Sipping from a plastic cup, Jackie grimaced, then discreetly spilled her spiked punch onto the sludgy fraternity-house floor. The University of Virginia freshman wasn't a drinker, but she didn't want to seem like a goody-goody at her very first frat party \u2013 and she especially wanted to impress her date, the handsome Phi Kappa Psi brother who'd brought her here. Jackie was sober but giddy with discovery as she looked around the room crammed with rowdy strangers guzzling beer and dancing to loud music. She smiled at her date, whom we'll call Drew, a good-looking junior \u2013 or in UVA parlance, a third-year \u2013 and he smiled enticingly back. \n \n Sidebar \n \n \"Want to go upstairs, where it's quieter?\" Drew shouted into her ear, and Jackie's heart quickened. She took his hand as he threaded them out of the crowded room and up a staircase. \n \n Four weeks into UVA's 2012 school year, 18-year-old Jackie was crushing it at college. A chatty, straight-A achiever from a rural Virginia town, she'd initially been intimidated by UVA's aura of preppy success, where throngs of toned, tanned and overwhelmingly blond students fanned across a landscape of neoclassical brick buildings, hurrying to classes, clubs, sports, internships, part-time jobs, volunteer work and parties; Jackie's orientation leader had warned her that UVA students' schedules were so packed that \"no one has time to date \u2013 people just hook up.\" But despite her reservations, Jackie had flung herself into campus life, attending events, joining clubs, making friends and, now, being asked on an actual date. She and Drew had met while working lifeguard shifts together at the university pool, and Jackie had been floored by Drew's invitation to dinner, followed by a \"date function\" at his fraternity, Phi Kappa Psi. The \"upper tier\" frat had a reputation of tremendous wealth, and its imposingly large house overlooked a vast manicured field, giving \"Phi Psi\" the undisputed best real estate along UVA's fraternity row known as Rugby Road. \n \n Phi Kappa Psi House \n \n Jackie had taken three hours getting ready, straightening her long, dark, wavy hair. She'd congratulated herself on her choice of a tasteful red dress with a high neckline. Now, climbing the frat-house stairs with Drew, Jackie felt excited. Drew ushered Jackie into a bedroom, shutting the door behind them. The room was pitch-black inside. Jackie blindly turned toward Drew, uttering his name. At that same moment, she says, she detected movement in the room \u2013 and felt someone bump into her. Jackie began to scream. \n \n \"Shut up,\" she heard a man's voice say as a body barreled into her, tripping her backward and sending them both crashing through a low glass table. There was a heavy person on top of her, spreading open her thighs, and another person kneeling on her hair, hands pinning down her arms, sharp shards digging into her back, and excited male voices rising all around her. When yet another hand clamped over her mouth, Jackie bit it, and the hand became a fist that punched her in the face. The men surrounding her began to laugh. For a hopeful moment Jackie wondered if this wasn't some collegiate prank. Perhaps at any second someone would flick on the lights and they'd return to the party. \n \n \"Grab its motherfucking leg,\" she heard a voice say. And that's when Jackie knew she was going to be raped. \n \n She remembers every moment of the next three hours of agony, during which, she says, seven men took turns raping her, while two more \u2013 her date, Drew, and another man \u2013 gave instruction and encouragement. She remembers how the spectators swigged beers, and how they called each other nicknames like Armpit and Blanket. She remembers the men's heft and their sour reek of alcohol mixed with the pungency of marijuana. Most of all, Jackie remembers the pain and the pounding that went on and on. \n \n As the last man sank onto her, Jackie was startled to recognize him: He attended her tiny anthropology discussion group. He looked like he was going to cry or puke as he told the crowd he couldn't get it up. \"Pussy!\" the other men jeered. \"What, she's not hot enough for you?\" Then they egged him on: \"Don't you want to be a brother?\" \"We all had to do it, so you do, too.\" Someone handed her classmate a beer bottle. Jackie stared at the young man, silently begging him not to go through with it. And as he shoved the bottle into her, Jackie fell into a stupor, mentally untethering from the brutal tableau, her mind leaving behind the bleeding body under assault on the floor. \n \n When Jackie came to, she was alone. It was after 3 a.m. She painfully rose from the floor and ran shoeless from the room. She emerged to discover the Phi Psi party still surreally under way, but if anyone noticed the barefoot, disheveled girl hurrying down a side staircase, face beaten, dress spattered with blood, they said nothing. Disoriented, Jackie burst out a side door, realized she was lost, and dialed a friend, screaming, \"Something bad happened. I need you to come and find me!\" Minutes later, her three best friends on campus \u2013 two boys and a girl (whose names are changed) \u2013 arrived to find Jackie on a nearby street corner, shaking. \"What did they do to you? What did they make you do?\" Jackie recalls her friend Randall demanding. Jackie shook her head and began to cry. The group looked at one another in a panic. They all knew about Jackie's date; the Phi Kappa Psi house loomed behind them. \"We have to get her to the hospital,\" Randall said. \n \n Their other two friends, however, weren't convinced. \"Is that such a good idea?\" she recalls Cindy asking. \"Her reputation will be shot for the next four years.\" Andy seconded the opinion, adding that since he and Randall both planned to rush fraternities, they ought to think this through. The three friends launched into a heated discussion about the social price of reporting Jackie's rape, while Jackie stood beside them, mute in her bloody dress, wishing only to go back to her dorm room and fall into a deep, forgetful sleep. Detached, Jackie listened as Cindy prevailed over the group: \"She's gonna be the girl who cried 'rape,' and we'll never be allowed into any frat party again.\" \n \n Two years later, Jackie, now a third-year, is worried about what might happen to her once this article comes out. Greek life is huge at UVA, with nearly one-third of undergrads belonging to a fraternity or sorority, so Jackie fears the backlash could be big \u2013 a \"shitshow\" predicted by her now-former friend Randall, who, citing his loyalty to his own frat, declined to be interviewed. But her concerns go beyond taking on her alleged assailants and their fraternity. Lots of people have discouraged her from sharing her story, Jackie tells me with a pained look, including the trusted UVA dean to whom Jackie reported her gang-rape allegations more than a year ago. On this deeply loyal campus, even some of Jackie's closest friends see her going public as tantamount to betrayal. \n \n Sidebar \n \n \"One of my roommates said, 'Do you want to be responsible for something that's gonna paint UVA in a bad light?' \" says Jackie, poking at a vegan burger at a restaurant on the Corner, UVA's popular retail strip. \"But I said, 'UVA has flown under the radar for so long, someone has to say something about it, or else it's gonna be this system that keeps perpetuating!' \" Jackie frowns. \"My friend just said, 'You have to remember where your loyalty lies.'\" \n \n From reading headlines today, one might think colleges have suddenly become hotbeds of protest by celebrated anti-rape activists. But like most colleges across America, genteel University of Virginia has no radical feminist culture seeking to upend the patriarchy. There are no red-tape-wearing protests like at Harvard, no \"sex-positive\" clubs promoting the female orgasm like at Yale, no mattress-hauling performance artists like at Columbia, and certainly no SlutWalks. UVA isn't an edgy or progressive campus by any stretch. The pinnacle of its polite activism is its annual Take Back the Night vigil, which on this campus of 21,000 students attracts an audience of less than 500 souls. But the dearth of attention isn't because rape doesn't happen in Charlottesville. It's because at UVA, rapes are kept quiet, both by students \u2013 who brush off sexual assaults as regrettable but inevitable casualties of their cherished party culture \u2013 and by an administration that critics say is less concerned with protecting students than it is with protecting its own reputation from scandal. Some UVA women, so sickened by the university's culture of hidden sexual violence, have taken to calling it \"UVrApe.\" \n \n \"University of Virginia thinks they're above the law,\" says UVA grad and victims-rights advocate Liz Seccuro. \"They go to such lengths to protect themselves. There's a national conversation about sexual assault, but nothing at UVA is changing.\" \n \n Liz Seccuro with her husband, Mike in front of the Charlottesville District Court in Charlottesville, Va., Thursday, March 15th, 2007. Steve Helber/AP \n \n S. Daniel Carter, who as former director of public policy for the advocacy group Clery Center for Security on Campus is a national expert on college safety, points out that UVA's sexual assault problems are not much worse than other schools; if anything, he says, the depressing reality is that UVA's situation is likely the norm. Decades of awareness programming haven't budged the prevalence of campus rape: One in five women is sexually assaulted in college, though only about 12 percent report it to police. Spurred by a wave of activism, the Obama administration has stepped up pressure on colleges, announcing Title IX investigations of 86 schools suspected of denying students their equal right to education by inadequately handling sexual-violence complaints; if found in violation, each school runs the risk of financial penalties, including the nuclear option (which has never been deployed) of having its federal funding revoked. \n \n The University of Virginia is one of the 86 schools now under federal investigation, but it has more reason to worry than most of its peers. Because, unlike most schools under scrutiny, where complaints are at issue, UVA is one of only 12 schools under a sweeping investigation known as \"compliance review\": a proactive probe launched by the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights itself, triggered by concerns about deep-rooted issues. \"They are targeted efforts to go after very serious concerns,\" says Office of Civil Rights assistant secretary Catherine Lhamon. \"We don't open compliance reviews unless we have something that we think merits it.\" \n \n UVA says it has been complying fully with the investigation. But Carter notes that UVA and other elite schools tend not to respond well to criticism and sanctify tradition above all else. \"That's common to more prestigious institutions,\" Carter says. \n \n Prestige is at the core of UVA's identity. Although a public school, its grounds of red-brick, white-columned buildings designed by founder Thomas Jefferson radiate old-money privilege, footnoted by the graffiti of UVA's many secret societies, whose insignias are neatly painted everywhere. At $10,000 a year, in-state tuition is a quarter the cost of the Ivies, but UVA tends to attract affluent students, and through aggressive fundraising boasts an endowment of $5 billion, on par with Cornell. \"Wealthy parents are the norm,\" says former UVA dean John Foubert. On top of all that, UVA enjoys a reputation as one of the best schools in the country, not to mention a campus so brimming with fun that in 2012 \u2013 the year of Jackie's rape \u2013 Playboy crowned it the nation's number-one party school. Students hold themselves up to that standard: studious by day, wild by night. \"The most impressive person at UVA is the person who gets straight A's and goes to all the parties,\" explains fourth-year student Brian Head. Partying traditions fuse the decorum of the Southern aristocracy with binge drinking: At Cavalier football tailgates, the dress code is \"girls in pearls, guys in ties\" while students guzzle handles of vodka. Not for nothing is a UVA student nicknamed a Wahoo, as undergrads like to explain; though derived from a long-ago yell from Cavalier fans, a wahoo is also a fish that can drink twice its own body weight. \n \n University of Virginia campus Lance King/Getty \n \n Wahoos are enthralled to be at UVA and can't wait to tell you the reasons why, beginning, surprisingly, with Thomas Jefferson, whose lore is so powerfully woven into everyday UVA life that you practically expect to glimpse the man still walking the grounds in his waistcoat and pantaloons. Nearly every student I interviewed found a way to mention \"TJ,\" speaking with zeal about their founding father's vision for an \"academical village\" in the idyllic setting of the Blue Ridge Mountains. They burble about UVA's honor code, a solemn pledge not to lie, cheat or steal; students are expected to snitch on violators, who are expelled. UVA's emphasis on honor is so pronounced that since 1998, 183 people have been expelled for honor-code violations such as cheating on exams. And yet paradoxically, not a single student at UVA has ever been expelled for sexual assault. \n \n \"Think about it,\" says Susan Russell, whose UVA daughter's sexual-assault report helped trigger a previous federal investigation. \"In what world do you get kicked out for cheating, but if you rape someone, you can stay?\" \n \n Attorney Wendy Murphy, who has filed Title IX complaints and lawsuits against schools including UVA, argues that in matters of sexual violence, Ivy League and Division I schools' fixation with prestige is their downfall. \"These schools love to pretend they protect the children as if they were their own, but that's not true: They're interested in money,\" Murphy says. \"In these situations, the one who gets the most protection is either a wealthy kid, a legacy kid or an athlete. The more privileged he is, the more likely the woman has to die before he's held accountable.\" Indeed, UVA is the same campus where the volatile relationship of lacrosse star George Huguely V and his girlfriend Yeardley Love was seen as unremarkable \u2013 his jealous rages, fanned by over-the-top drinking \u2013 until the 2010 day he kicked open her door and beat her to death. \n \n UVA president Teresa Sullivan denies the administration sweeps sexual assault under the rug. \"If we're trying to hide the issue, we're not doing a very good job of it,\" she says, noting that this past February UVA hosted the first-ever sexual-assault summit for college administrators. It's true that recently, while under close government scrutiny, the school has made some encouraging changes, including designating most UVA authority figures as mandatory reporters of sexual assault and teaming up with student activists to create a bystander-intervention campaign. Students praise UVA's deans as caring folks who answer late-night calls from victims and even make emergency-room visits. \n \n University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan AP \n \n And yet the UVA public-relations team seemed unenthused about this article, canceling my interview with the head of UVA's Sexual Misconduct Board, and forbidding other administrators from cooperating; even students seemed infected by their anxiety about how members of the administration might appear. And when President Sullivan was at last made available for an interview, her most frequently invoked answer to my specific questions about sexual-assault handling at UVA \u2013 while two other UVA staffers sat in on the recorded call \u2013 was \"I don't know.\" \n \n All you girls from Mary Washington \n \n and RMWC, never let a Cavalier an inch above your knee. \n \n He'll take you to his fraternity house and fill you full of beer. \n \n And soon you'll be the mother of a bastard Cavalier! \n \n \"Rugby Road\" \n \n Two weeks after Jackie's rape, she ran into Drew during her lifeguard shift at the UVA pool. \"Hey, Jackie,\" Drew said, startling her. \"Are you ignoring me?\" She'd switched her shift in the hopes of never seeing him again. Since the Phi Kappa Psi party, she'd barely left her dorm room, fearful of glimpsing one of her attackers. Jackie stared at Drew, unable to speak. \"I wanted to thank you for the other night,\" Drew said. \"I had a great time.\" \n \n Sidebar \n \n Jackie left her shift early, saying she wasn't feeling well. Then she walked back to her dorm and crawled under the covers. She didn't go to classes for the rest of the week, and soon quit her lifeguarding job \u2013 the first time she could remember quitting anything. She would never again return to the Anthropology course she shared with one of her assailants. She was constantly on the edge of panic, plagued by flashbacks \u2013 and disgusted by her own naivet\u00e9. She obsessed over what easy prey she'd been, as the attention-starved freshman who for weeks drank up Drew's flirtations. \"I still grapple with 'Did I do something that could have been construed as that's what I wanted?' \" she says. \n \n Before Jackie left for college, her parents \u2013 a Vietnam vet and retired military contractor, and a stay-at-home mom \u2013 had lectured her about avoiding the perils of the social scene, stressing the importance of her studies, since Jackie hoped to get into medical school. Jackie had a strained relationship with her father, in whose eyes she'd never felt good enough, and always responded by exceeding expectations \u2013 honor roll, swim team, first-chair violin \u2013 becoming the role model for her two younger brothers. Jackie had been looking forward to college as an escape \u2013 a place to, even, defy her parents' wishes and go to a frat party. \"And I guess they were right,\" she says bitterly. \n \n She was having an especially difficult time figuring out how to process that awful night, because her small social circle seemed so underwhelmed. For the first month of school, Jackie had latched onto a crew of lighthearted social strivers, and her pals were now impatient for Jackie to rejoin the merriment. \"You're still upset about that?\" Andy asked one Friday night when Jackie was crying. Cindy, a self-declared hookup queen, said she didn't see why Jackie was so bent out of shape. \"Why didn't you have fun with it?\" Cindy asked. \"A bunch of hot Phi Psi guys?\" One of Jackie's friends told her, unconcerned, \"Andy said you had a bad experience at a frat, and you've been a baby ever since.\" \n \n \"Some of my hallmates were skeptical,\" says one survivor of rape. \"They were silent and avoided me afterwards. It Made me doubt myself.\" \n \n That reaction of dismissal, downgrading and doubt is a common theme UVA rape survivors hear, including from women. \"Some of my hallmates were skeptical,\" recalls recent grad Emily Renda, who says that weeks into her first year she was raped after a party. \"They were silent and avoided me afterwards. It made me doubt myself.\" Other students encounter more overt hostility, as when a first-year student confided her assault to a friend. \"She said she thought I was just looking for attention,\" says the undergrad. Shrugging off a rape or pointing fingers at the victim can be a self-protective maneuver for women, a form of wishful thinking to reassure themselves they could never be so vulnerable to violence. For men, skepticism is a form of self-protection too. For much of their lives, they've looked forward to the hedonistic fun of college, bearing every expectation of booze and no-strings sex. A rape heralds the uncomfortable idea that all that harmless mayhem may not be so harmless after all. Easier, then, to assume the girl is lying, even though studies indicate that false rape reports account for, at most, eight percent of reports. \n \n Emily Renda Courtesy of Emily Renda \n \n And so at UVA, where social status is paramount, outing oneself as a rape victim can be a form of social suicide. \"I don't know many people who are engrossed in the party scene and have spoken out about their sexual assaults,\" says third-year student Sara Surface. After all, no one climbs the social ladder only to cast themselves back down. Emily Renda, for one, quickly figured out that few classmates were sympathetic to her plight, and instead channeled her despair into hard partying. \"My drinking didn't stand out,\" says Renda, who often ended her nights passed out on a bathroom floor. \"It does make you wonder how many others are doing what I did: drinking to self-medicate.\" \n \n By the middle of her first semester, Jackie's alarm would ring and ring in her dorm room until one of her five suitemates would pad down the hall to turn it off. Jackie would barely stir in her bed. \"That was when we realized she was even there,\" remembers suitemate Rachel Soltis. \"At the beginning of the year, she seemed like a normal, happy girl, always with friends. Then her door was closed all the time. We just figured she was out.\" Long since abandoned by her original crew, Jackie had slept through half a semester's worth of classes and had bought a length of rope with which to hang herself. Instead, as the semester crawled to an end, she called her mother. \"Come and get me,\" Jackie told her, crying. \"I need your help.\" \n \n The first weeks of freshman year are when students are most vulnerable to sexual assault. Spend a Friday night in mid-September walking along Rugby Road at UVA, and you can begin to see why. Hundreds of women in crop tops and men in khaki shorts stagger between handsome fraternity houses, against a call-and-response soundtrack of \"Whoo!\" and breaking glass. \"Do you know where Delta Sig is?\" a girl slurs, sloshed. Behind her, one of her dozen or so friends stumbles into the street, sending a beer bottle shattering. (\"Whoo!\" calls a far-away voice.) \n \n Sidebar \n \n \"These are all first-years,\" narrates one of my small group of upperclasswomen guides. We walk the curving length of tree-lined Rugby Road as they explain the scene. The women rattle off which one is known as the \"roofie frat,\" where supposedly four girls have been drugged and raped, and at which house a friend had a recent \"bad experience,\" the Wahoo euphemism for sexual assault. Studies have shown that fraternity men are three times as likely to commit rape, and a spate of recent high-profile cases illustrates the dangers that can lurk at frat parties, like a University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee frat accused of using color-coded hand stamps as a signal to roofie their guests, and this fall's suspension of Brown University's chapter of Phi Kappa Psi \u2013 of all fraternities \u2013 after a partygoer tested positive for the date-rape drug GHB. Presumably, the UVA freshmen wobbling around us are oblivious to any specific hazards along Rugby Road; having just arrived on campus, they can hardly tell one fraternity from another. As we pass another frat house, one of my guides offers, \"I know a girl who got assaulted there.\" \n \n Phi Kappa Psi House \n \n \"I do too!\" says her friend in mock-excitement. \"That makes two! Yay!\" \n \n Frats are often the sole option for an underage drinker looking to party, since bars are off-limits, sororities are dry and first-year students don't get many invites to apartment soirees. Instead, the kids crowd the walkways of the big, anonymous frat houses, vying for entry. \"Hot girls who are drunk always get in \u2013 it's a good idea to act drunker than you really are,\" says third-year Alexandria Pinkleton, expertly clad in the UVA-after-dark uniform of a midriff-baring sleeveless top and shorts. \"Also? You have to seem very innocent and vulnerable. That's why they love first-year girls.\" \n \n Once successfully inside the frat house, women play the role of grateful guests in unfamiliar territory where men control the variables. In dark, loud basements, girls accept drinks, are pulled onto dance floors to be ground and groped and, later, often having lost sight of their friends, led into bathrooms or up the stairs for privacy. Most of that hooking up is consensual. But against that backdrop, as psychologist David Lisak discovered, lurk undetected predators. Lisak's 2002 groundbreaking study of more than 1,800 college men found that roughly nine out of 10 rapes are committed by serial offenders, who are responsible for an astonishing average of six rapes each. None of the offenders in Lisak's study had ever been reported. Lisak's findings upended general presumptions about campus sexual assault: It implied that most incidents are not bumbling, he-said-she-said miscommunications, but rather deliberate crimes by serial sex offenders. \n \n In his study, Lisak's subjects described the ways in which they used the camouflage of college as fruitful rape-hunting grounds. They told Lisak they target freshmen for being the most na\u00efve and the least-experienced drinkers. One offender described how his party-hearty friends would help incapacitate his victims: \"We always had some kind of punch. . . . We'd make it with a real sweet juice. It was really powerful stuff. The girls wouldn't know what hit them.\" Presumably, the friends mixing the drinks did so without realizing the offender's plot, just as when they probably high-fived him the next morning, they didn't realize the behavior they'd just endorsed. That's because the serial rapist's behavior can look ordinary at college. \"They're not acting in a vacuum,\" observes Lisak of predators. \"They're echoing that message and that culture that's around them: the objectification and degradation of women.\" \n \n One need only glance around at some recent college hijinks to see spectacular examples of the way the abasement of women has broken through to no-holds-barred misogyny: a Dartmouth student's how-to-rape guide posted online this past January; Yale pledges chanting \"No means yes! Yes means anal!\" And despite its air of mannered civility, UVA has been in on the naughty fun for at least 70 years with its jolly fight song \"Rugby Road,\" which celebrates the sexual triumphs of UVA fraternity men, named for the very same street where my guides and I are now enveloped in a thickening crowd of wasted first-years. Through the decades, the song has expanded to 35 verses, with the more recent, student-penned stanzas shedding the song's winking tone in favor of something more jarringly explicit: \n \n A hundred Delta Gammas, a thousand AZDs \n \n Ten thousand Pi Phi bitches who get down on their knees \n \n But the ones that we hold true, the ones that we hold dear \n \n Are the ones who stay up late at night, and take it in the rear. \n \n In 2010, \"Rugby Road\" was banned from football games \u2013 despite a petition calling it \"an integral part\" of UVA culture. But Wahoos fearing the loss of tradition can take heart that \"Rugby Road\" verses are still performed on campus by UVA's oldest a cappella group, the Virginia Gentlemen. \n \n At the end of her freshman year, Jackie found herself in the Peabody Hall office of Dean Nicole Eramo, head of UVA's Sexual Misconduct Board. This was a big step for Jackie. She still hadn't even managed to tell her own mother exactly what had happened at Phi Kappa Psi. Upon returning to school for her second semester, Jackie had tried to put on a brave face and simply move forward, but instead continued falling apart. Though a psychiatrist had put Jackie on Wellbutrin, she had remained depressed, couldn't concentrate, and spent the semester so frightened and withdrawn that her academic dean finally called her in to discuss why she'd failed three classes. In his office, with her mother beside her, she'd burst into tears, and her mother explained she'd had a \"bad experience\" at a party. He'd blanched and given Jackie the e-mail for Dean Eramo. \n \n Sidebar \n \n If Dean Eramo was surprised at Jackie's story of gang rape, it didn't show. A short woman with curly dark hair and a no-nonsense demeanor, Eramo surely has among the most difficult jobs at UVA. As the intake person on behalf of the university for all sexual-assault complaints since 2006, it's her job to deal with a parade of sobbing students trekking in and out of her office. (UVA declined to make Eramo available for comment.) A UVA alum herself, Eramo is beloved by survivors, who consider her a friend and confidante \u2013 even though, as only a few students are aware, her office isn't a confidential space at all. Each time a new complaint comes through Eramo's office, it activates a review by UVA's Title IX officer, is included in UVA's tally of federally mandated Clery Act crime statistics, and Eramo may, at her discretion, reveal details of her conversation with the student to other administrators. (Jackie was mortified to learn later that Eramo had shared her identity with another UVA administrator.) After all, a dean's foremost priority is the overall safety of the campus. \n \n Jackie says when she asked why UVA's rape stats were hard to find, the dean said, \"Because nobody wants to send their daughter to the rape school.\" \n \n When Jackie finished talking, Eramo comforted her, then calmly laid out her options. If Jackie wished, she could file a criminal complaint with police. Or, if Jackie preferred to keep the matter within the university, she had two choices. She could file a complaint with the school's Sexual Misconduct Board, to be decided in a \"formal resolution\" with a jury of students and faculty, and a dean as judge. Or Jackie could choose an \"informal resolution,\" in which Jackie could simply face her attackers in Eramo's presence and tell them how she felt; Eramo could then issue a directive to the men, such as suggesting counseling. Eramo presented each option to Jackie neutrally, giving each equal weight. She assured Jackie there was no pressure \u2013 whatever happened next was entirely her choice. \n \n Like many schools, UVA has taken to emphasizing that in matters of sexual assault, it caters to victim choice. \"If students feel that we are forcing them into a criminal or disciplinary process that they don't want to be part of, frankly, we'd be concerned that we would get fewer reports,\" says associate VP for student affairs Susan Davis. Which in theory makes sense: Being forced into an unwanted choice is a sensitive point for the victims. But in practice, that utter lack of guidance can be counterproductive to a 19-year-old so traumatized as Jackie was that she was contemplating suicide. Setting aside for a moment the absurdity of a school offering to handle the investigation and adjudication of a felony sex crime \u2013 something Title IX requires, but which no university on Earth is equipped to do \u2013 the sheer menu of choices, paired with the reassurance that any choice is the right one, often has the end result of coddling the victim into doing nothing. \n \n \"This is an alarming trend that I'm seeing on campuses,\" says Laura Dunn of the advocacy group SurvJustice. \"Schools are assigning people to victims who are pretending, or even thinking, they're on the victim's side, when they're actually discouraging and silencing them. Advocates who survivors love are part of the system that is failing to address sexual violence.\" \n \n Phi Kappa Psi House Illustration by John Ritter \n \n Absent much guidance, Jackie would eventually wonder how other student victims handled her situation. But when she clicked around on UVA's website, she found no answers. All she found were the UVA police's crime logs, which the university makes available online, but are mostly a list of bike theft, vandalism and public-drunkenness complaints. That's because only a fraction of UVA students who report sex crimes turn to campus police. The rest go to Dean Eramo's office, to Charlottesville police or the county sheriff's office. Yet when RS asked UVA for its statistics, the press office repeatedly referred us to the UVA police crime logs. UVA parent Susan Russell believes that misdirection is deliberate. \"When a parent goes to the campus crime log, and they don't see sexual assault, they think the school is safe,\" Russell says, adding that her daughter's 2004 sexual assault once appeared in the log mislabeled \"Suspicious Circumstances.\" \n \n Eventually, UVA furnished Rolling Stone with some of its most recent tally: In the last academic year, 38 students went to Eramo about a sexual assault, up from about 20 students three years ago. However, of those 38, only nine resulted in \"complaints\"; the other 29 students evaporated. Of those nine complaints, four resulted in Sexual Misconduct Board hearings. UVA wasn't willing to disclose their outcomes, citing privacy. Like most colleges, sexual-assault proceedings at UVA unfold in total secrecy. Asked why UVA doesn't publish all its data, President Sullivan explains that it might not be in keeping with \"best practices\" and thus may inadvertently discourage reporting. Jackie got a different explanation when she'd eventually asked Dean Eramo the same question. She says Eramo answered wryly, \"Because nobody wants to send their daughter to the rape school.\" \n \n For now, however, Jackie left her first meeting with Eramo feeling better for having unburdened herself, and with the dean's assurance that nothing would be done without her say-so. Eramo e-mailed a follow-up note thanking Jackie for sharing, saying, \"I could tell that was very difficult for you,\" and restating that while she respected Jackie's wish not to file a report, she'd be happy to assist \"if you decide that you would like to hold these men accountable.\" In the meantime, having presumably judged there to be no threat to public safety, the UVA administration took no action to warn the campus that an allegation of gang rape had been made against an active fraternity. \n \n All the first-year women are morally uptight. \n \n They'll never do a single thing unless they know it's right. \n \n But then they come to Rugby Road and soon they've seen the light. \n \n And you never know how many men they'll bring home every night. \n \n \"Rugby Road\" \n \n You can trace UVA's cycle of sexual violence and institutional indifference back at least 30 years \u2013 and incredibly, the trail leads back to Phi Psi. In October 1984, Liz Seccuro was a 17-year-old virgin when she went to a party at the frat and was handed a mixed drink. \"They called it the house special,\" she remembers. Things became spotty after Seccuro had a few sips. But etched in pain was a clear memory of a stranger raping her on a bed. She woke up wrapped in a bloody sheet; by rifling through the boy's mail before fleeing, she discovered his name was Will Beebe. Incredibly, 21 years later, Beebe wrote Seccuro a letter, saying he wanted to make amends as part of his 12-step program. Seccuro took the correspondence to Charlottesville police. And in the midst of the 2006 prosecution that followed, where Beebe would eventually plead guilty to aggravated sexual battery, investigators made a startling discovery: That while at Phi Psi that night, Seccuro had been assaulted not by one man, but by three. \"I had been gang-raped,\" says Seccuro, who detailed her ordeal in a 2011 memoir. \n \n William N. Beebe out of the Charlottesville, Va. Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court on Tuesday, Jan. 17th, 2006. Brady Wolfe/Daily Progress/AP \n \n That it took two decades for Seccuro to achieve some justice is even more disgraceful, since she reported her rape to the UVA administration after leaving the Phi Psi house on that 1984 morning. \"I went to the dean covered in scabs and with broken ribs,\" she remembers. \"And he said, 'Do you think it was just regrettable sex?' \" Seccuro wanted to call police, but she was incorrectly told Charlottesville police lacked jurisdiction over fraternity houses. \n \n If Seccuro's story of administrative cover-up and apathy sounds outrageous, it's actually in keeping with the stories told by other UVA survivors. After one alumna was abducted from a dark, wooded section of campus and raped in 1993, she says she asked a UVA administrator for better lighting. \"They told me it would ruin Jefferson's vision of what the university was supposed to look like,\" the alum says. \"As if Thomas Jefferson even knew about electric lights!\" In 2002 and 2004, two female students, including Susan Russell's daughter, were unhappy with their sexual-misconduct hearings, which each felt didn't hold their alleged perpetrators accountable \u2013 and each was admonished by UVA administrators to never speak publicly about the proceedings or else they could face expulsion for violating the honor code. For issuing that directive, in 2008 UVA was found in violation of the Clery Act. \n \n \"UVA is more egregious than most,\" says John Foubert, a UVA dean from 1998 to 2002, and founder of the national male sex-assault peer education group One in Four. \"I've worked for five or six colleges, and the stuff I saw happen during my time there definitely stands out.\" For example, Foubert recalls, in one rare case in which the university applied a harsh penalty, an undergrad was suspended after stalking five students. Heated discussion ensued over whether the boy should be allowed back after his suspension. Though the counseling center wanted him to stay gone, Foubert says, the then-dean of students argued in favor of his return, saying, \"We can pick our lawsuit from a potential sixth victim, or from him, for denying him access to an education.\" \n \n The few stories leaking out of UVA's present-day justice system aren't much better. One student, whose Title IX complaint against UVA is currently under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights, said that in December 2011, another student raped her while she was blackout drunk, possibly drugged. As she wrote in a student publication, evidence emerged that the man had previously been accused of drugging others, but the information was rejected as \"prejudicial.\" The Sexual Misconduct Board told the young woman it found her \"compelling and believable,\" but found the man not guilty. \"I had never felt so betrayed and let down in my life,\" wrote the woman. \"They said that they believed me. They said that UVA was my home and that it loved me. Yet, how could they believe me and let him go completely unpunished?\" \n \n Rolling Stone has discovered that this past spring a UVA first-year student, whom we'll call Stacy, filed a report stating that while vomiting up too much whiskey into a male friend's toilet one night, he groped her, plunged his hands down her sweatpants and then, after carrying her semi-conscious to his bed, digitally penetrated her. When the Charlottesville DA's office declined to file charges, she says, Stacy asked for a hearing with the Sexual Misconduct Board, and was surprised when UVA authority figures tried to talk her out of it. \"My counselors, members of the Dean of Students office, everyone said the trial process would be way too hard on me,\" says Stacy. \"They were like, 'You need to focus on your healing.' \" Stacy insisted upon moving forward anyway, even when the wealthy family of the accused kicked up a fuss. \"They threatened to sue deans individually, they threatened to sue me,\" she recalls. But Stacy remained stalwart, because she had additional motivation: She'd been shaken to discover two other women with stories of assault by the same man. \"One was days after mine, at a rush function at his frat house,\" says Stacy. \"So I was like, 'I have to do something before someone else is hurt.' \" Her determination redoubled after the Dean of Students office informed her that multiple assaults by a student would be grounds for his expulsion \u2013 a mantra that Eramo repeated at a Take Back the Night event in April. \n \n Jackie came across something disturbing: Two other young women confided that they, too, had been victims of Phi Kappa Psi gang rapes. \n \n Bearing her deans' words in mind, at her nine-hour formal hearing in June, Stacy took pains to present not only her own case, but also the other two allegations, submitting witness statements that were allowed in as \"pattern evidence.\" The board pronounced the man guilty for sexual misconduct against Stacy, making him only the 14th guilty person in UVA's history. Stacy was relieved at the verdict. \"I was like, 'He's gone!' 'Cause he's a multiple assailant, I'd been told so many times that that was grounds for expulsion!\" So she was stunned when she learned his actual penalty: a one-year suspension. (Citing privacy laws, UVA would not comment on this or any case.) \n \n Turns out, when UVA personnel speak of expulsion for \"multiple assaults,\" they mean multiple complaints that are filed with the Sexual Misconduct Board, and then adjudicated guilty. Under that more precise definition, the two other cases introduced in Stacy's case didn't count toward his penalty. Stacy feels offended by the outcome and misled by the deans. \"After two rapes and an assault, to let him back on grounds is an insult to the honor system that UVA brags about,\" she says. \"UVA doesn't want to expel. They were too afraid of getting negative publicity or the pants sued \n \n off them.\" \n \n She's a helluva twat from Agnes Scott, she'll fuck for 50 cents. \n \n She'll lay her ass upon the grass, her panties on the fence. \n \n You supply the liquor, and she'll supply the lay. \n \n And if you can't get it up, you sunuva bitch, you're not from UVA. \n \n \"Rugby Road\" \n \n When did it happen to you?\" Emily Renda asked Jackie as they sat for coffee at the outdoor Downtown Mall in the fall of 2013. \n \n \"September 28th,\" Jackie whispered. \n \n \"October 7th, 2010,\" Emily responded, not breaking her gaze, and Jackie knew she'd found a friend. As Jackie had begun her second year at UVA, she'd continued struggling. Dean Eramo had connected her with Emily, a fourth-year who'd become active in One Less, a student-run sexual-assault education organization that doubles as a support group. Sitting with Emily, Jackie poured out her story, wiping her eyes with napkins as she confided to Emily that she felt like a broken person. \"You're not broken,\" Emily told her. \"They're the ones who are fucked up, and what happened to you wasn't your fault.\" Jackie was flooded with gratitude, desperate to hear those words at last \u2013 and from someone who knew. Emily invited her to a meeting of One Less, thus introducing her to UVA's true secret society. \n \n Illustration by John Ritter: Photo of Nicole Eramo in Illustration by Jenna Truong/Cavalier Daily \n \n In its weekly meetings, the 45-member group would discuss how to foster dialogue on campus. Afterward they'd splinter off and share stories of sexual assault, each tale different and yet very much the same. Many took place on tipsy nights with men who refused to stop; some were of sex while blackout drunk; rarer stories involved violence, though none so extreme as Jackie's. But no matter the circumstances, their peers' reactions were largely the same: Assaults were brushed off, with attackers defended (\"He'd never do anything like that\"), the victim questioned (\"Are you sure?\"). After feeling isolated for more than a year, Jackie was astonished at how much she and this sisterhood had in common, including the fact that a surprising number hadn't pursued any form of complaint. Although many had contacted Dean Eramo, whom they laud as their best advocate and den mother \u2013 Jackie repeatedly calls her \"an asset to the community\" \u2013 few ever filed reports with UVA or with police. Instead, basking in the safety of one another's company, the members of One Less applauded the brave few who chose to take action, but mostly affirmed each other's choices not to report, in an echo of their university's approach. So profound was the students' faith in its administration that although they were appalled by Jackie's story, no one voiced questions about UVA's strategy of doing nothing to warn the campus of gang-rape allegations against a fraternity that still held parties and was rushing a new pledge class. \n \n Some of these women are disturbed by the contradiction. \"It's easy to cover up a rape at a university if no one is reporting,\" admits Jackie's friend Alex Pinkleton. And privately, some of Jackie's confidantes were outraged. \"The university ignores the problem to make itself look better,\" says recent grad Rachel Soltis, Jackie's former roommate. \"They should have done something in Jackie's case. Me and several other people know exactly who did this to her. But they want to protect even the people who are doing these horrible things.\" \n \n But no such doubts shadowed the meetings of One Less, which was fine by Jackie. One Less held seminars for student groups on bystander intervention and how to be supportive of survivors. Jackie dove into her new roles as peer adviser and Take Back the Night committee member and began to discover just how wide her secret UVA survivor network was \u2013 because the more she shared her story, the more girls sought her out, waylaying her after presentations or after classes, even calling in the middle of the night with a crisis. Jackie has been approached by so many survivors that she wonders whether the one-in-five statistic may not apply in Charlottesville. \"I feel like it's one in three at UVA,\" she says. \n \n But payback for being so public on a campus accustomed to silence was swift. This past spring, in separate incidents, both Emily Renda and Jackie were harassed outside bars on the Corner by men who recognized them from presentations and called them \"cunt\" and \"feminazi bitch.\" One flung a bottle at Jackie that broke on the side of her face, leaving a blood-red bruise around her eye. \n \n She e-mailed Eramo so they could discuss the attack \u2013 and discuss another matter, too, which was troubling Jackie a great deal. Through her ever expanding network, Jackie had come across something deeply disturbing: two other young women who, she says, confided that they, too, had recently been Phi Kappa Psi gang-rape victims. \n \n A bruise still mottling her face, Jackie sat in Eramo's office in May 2014 and told her about the two others. One, she says, is a 2013 graduate, who'd told Jackie that she'd been gang-raped as a freshman at the Phi Psi house. The other was a first-year whose worried friends had called Jackie after the girl had come home wearing no pants. Jackie said the girl told her she'd been assaulted by four men in a Phi Psi bathroom while a fifth watched. (Neither woman was willing to talk to RS.) \n \n As Jackie wrapped up her story, she was disappointed by Eramo's nonreaction. She'd expected shock, disgust, horror. For months, Jackie had been assuaging her despair by throwing herself into peer education, but there was no denying her helplessness when she thought about Phi Psi, or about her own alleged assailants still walking the grounds. She'd recently been aghast to bump into Drew, who greeted her with friendly nonchalance. \"For a whole year, I thought about how he had ruined my life, and how he is the worst human being ever,\" Jackie says. \"And then I saw him and I couldn't say anything.\" \n \n \"You look different,\" Drew told Jackie while she stared back at him in fear, and he was right: Since arriving at UVA, Jackie had gained 25 pounds from antidepressants and lack of exercise. That interaction would render her too depressed to leave her room for days. Of all her assailants, Drew was the one she wanted to see held accountable \u2013 but with Drew about to graduate, he was going to get away with it. Because, as she miserably reminded Eramo in her office, she didn't feel ready to file a complaint. Eramo, as always, understood. \n \n Given the swirl of gang-rape allegations Eramo had now heard against one of UVA's oldest and most powerful fraternities \u2013 founded in 1853, its distinguished chapter members have included President Woodrow Wilson \u2013 the school may have wondered about its responsibilities to the rest of the campus. Experts apprised of the situation by RS agreed that despite the absence of an official report, Jackie's passing along two other allegations should compel the school to take action out of regard for campus safety. \"The fact that they already had that first victim, they should have been taking action,\" says SurvJustice's Laura Dunn. \"That school could really be sued.\" \n \n If the UVA administration was roiled by such concerns, however, it wasn't apparent this past September, as it hosted a trustees meeting. Two full hours had been set aside to discuss campus sexual assault, an amount of time that, as many around the conference table pointed out, underscored the depth of UVA's commitment. Those two hours, however, were devoted entirely to upbeat explanations of UVA's new prevention and response strategies, and to self-congratulations to UVA for being a \"model\" among schools in this arena. Only once did the room darken with concern, when a trustee in UVA colors \u2013 blue sport coat, orange bow tie \u2013 interrupted to ask, \"Are we under any federal investigation with regard to sexual assault?\" \n \n Dean of students Allen Groves, in a blue suit and orange necktie of his own, swooped in with a smooth answer. He affirmed that while like many of its peers UVA was under investigation, it was merely a \"standard compliance review.\" He mentioned that a student's complaint from the 2010-11 academic year had been folded into that \"routine compliance review.\" Having downplayed the significance of a Title IX compliance review \u2013 which is neither routine nor standard \u2013 he then elaborated upon the lengths to which UVA has cooperated with the Office of Civil Rights' investigation, his tone and manner so reassuring that the room relaxed. \n \n Told of the meeting, Office of Civil Rights' Catherine Lhamon calls Groves' mischaracterization \"deliberate and irresponsible.\" \"Nothing annoys me more than a school not taking seriously their review from the federal government about their civil rights obligations,\" she says. \n \n Within days of the board meeting, having learned of Rolling Stone's probe into Jackie's story, UVA at last placed Phi Kappa Psi under investigation. Or rather, as President Sullivan carefully answered my question about allegations of gang rape at Phi Psi, \"We do have a fraternity under investigation.\" Phi Kappa Psi national executive director Shawn Collinsworth says that UVA indeed notified him of sexual assault allegations; he immediately dispatched a representative to meet with the chapter. UVA chapter president Stephen Scipione recalls being only told of a vague, anonymous \"fourth-hand\" allegation of a sexual assault during a party. \"We were not told that it was rape, but rather that something of a sexual nature took place,\" he wrote to RS in an e-mail. Either way, Collinsworth says, given the paucity of information, \"we have no evidence to substantiate the alleged assaults.\" \n \n \"Under investigation,\" President Sullivan insists when I ask her to elaborate on how the university is handling the case. \"I don't know how else to spell that out for you.\" But Jackie may have gotten a glimpse into the extent of the investigation when, in the days following my visit to campus, she was called into Eramo's office, bringing along her friend Alex for moral support. According to both women, Eramo revealed that she'd learned \"through the grapevine\" that \"all the boys involved have graduated.\" Both girls were mystified. Not only had Jackie just seen one of the boys riding his bike on grounds but, as Alex pointed out, \"Doesn't that mean they're admitting something happened?\" No warning has yet been issued to the campus. \n \n With a pocketknife and pepper spray tucked into her handbag, and a rape whistle hanging from her key chain, Jackie is prepared for a Friday night at UVA. In a restaurant on the Corner, Jackie sips water through a straw as the first of the night's \"Whoo!\"s reverberate from the sidewalk outside. \"It makes me really depressed, almost,\" says Jackie with a sad chuckle. \"There's always gonna be another Friday night, and another fraternity party, and another girl.\" \n \n Across the table, Alex sighs. \"I know,\" she says. Bartenders and bouncers all along the Corner are wearing T-shirts advertising the new \"Hoos Got Your Back\" bystander-intervention campaign, which all seems very hopeful. But this week, the third week of September, has been a difficult one. Charlottesville police received their first sexual-assault report of the academic year; Jackie and Alex were also each approached by someone seeking help about an assault. And as this weekend progresses, things will get far worse at UVA: Two more sexual assaults will be reported to police, and, in every parent's worst fears come true, an 18-year-old student on her way to a party will vanish; her body will be discovered five weeks later. \n \n Suspect Jesse Matthew Jr., a 32-year-old UVA hospital worker, will be charged with Hannah Graham's \"abduction with intent to defile,\" and a chilling portrait will emerge of an alleged predator who got his start, a decade ago, as a campus rapist. Back in 2002, and again in 2003, Matthew was accused of sexual assault at two different Virginia colleges where he was enrolled, but was never prosecuted. In 2005, according to the new police indictment, Matthew sexually assaulted a 26-year-old and tried to kill her. DNA has also reportedly linked Matthew to the 2009 death of Virginia Tech student Morgan Harrington, who disappeared after a Metallica concert in Charlottesville. The grisly dossier of which Matthew has been accused underscores the premise that campus rape should be seen not through the schema of a dubious party foul, but as a violent crime \u2013 and that victims should be encouraged to come forward as an act of civic good that could potentially spare future victims. \n \n Jackie is hoping she will get there someday. She badly wants to muster the courage to file criminal charges or even a civil case. But she's paralyzed. \"It's like I'm in my own personal prison,\" she says. \"I'm so terrified this is going to be the rest of my life.\" She still cries a lot, and she has been more frightened than usual to be alone or to walk in the dark.

She frantically calls to herself to stop, but knows it's too late: That in real life, she's already gone up those stairs and into that terrible room, and things will never be the same. It bothers Jackie to know that Drew and the rest get to walk away as if nothing happened, but that she still walks toward that room every night \u2013 and blames herself for it during the day. \n \n \"Everything bad in my life now is built around that one bad decision that I made,\" she says. \"All because I went to that stupid party.\" ||||| Fraternities wanting to throw parties at the University of Virginia will have to get three members to stay \"sober and lucid\" to monitor behavior and bedrooms, under new rules imposed after a media report of a gang rape at one of the gatherings. \n \n The student houses will also have to post a guard at the front door and ban pre-mixed drinks, according to the safety regulations the university announced on Tuesday. \n \n At least one of the sober monitors will have to be posted on the staircase leading to bedrooms and have access to every room in the house, the university said. \n \n UVA banned all social events at fraternities and sororities after Rolling Stone magazine published an article in November detailing an alleged rape at a party in September 2012, and accusations that the university failed to respond. \n \n Rolling Stone later said there were editorial mistakes in its story and asked Columbia University's journalism school to review the coverage. \n \n UVA President Teresa Sullivan said the ban would be lifted, as long as the organizations signed onto the new regulations meant to guard against excessive drinking and the risk of sexual violence. \n \n \"I believe the new safety measures recommended by the student leaders in the Greek community (the fraternities and sororities) will help provide a safer environment for their members and guests,\" Sullivan said. \n \n Sexual violence on campuses has come under increasing scrutiny after a number of high-profile cases. \n \n Last week, Harvard Law School agreed to overhaul the way it handles sexual harassment complaints among its students after a long-running federal investigation found it was violating U.S. law. \n \n (Reporting by Curtis Skinner in San Francisco; Editing by Andrew Heavens) ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

President Teresa Sullivan yesterday announced the changes to the university's Fraternal Organization Agreement and said the school would lift a ban on social events\u2014but only if groups agree to the new safety regulations, the AP reports. Each chapter has until Jan. 16 to sign off on the new regulations, adds the Washington Post.The university had instituted the ban after a November Rolling Stone article (since found to have \"discrepancies\") alleged that a student had been raped at a 2012 frat party and that university response had been lacking, Reuters notes. The new rules maintain that one of the sober monitors\u2014all of whom must wear a label identifying them as such\u2014must be posted where alcohol is being served, while another is required to keep tabs on any staircases leading to bedrooms and have \"immediate key access to each room\" of the fraternity house, the Post notes. Premixed drinks or any other \"common source of alcohol\" (including kegs) is prohibited; beer can be doled out in unopened cans, but wine can be poured and served only by a sober monitor. And that's if guests make it into the party: Under a section titled \"Eliminating Discomfort and Chaos: Entry Management\" is a mandate for a hired security guard at the entry door to check guest lists during \"Tier I\" events (larger parties); a frat member can monitor the list during smaller \"Tier II\" events. (A Slate columnist came under fire for linking rape to women's drinking.)",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 University of Virginia President Teresa Sullivan says fraternities and sororities are being allowed to reinstate social activities, provided they agree to new safety practices. The Greek system at U.Va. came under scrutiny after Rolling Stone magazine reported on an alleged gang rape at a fraternity house in 2012. In a statement issued today, Sullivan said she approved additions to the university's Fraternal Organization Agreement. Sullivan said the changes will enhance the safety of students, the AP reports. The new rules will call for a hired security agent to be stationed at the door during large parties to check guest lists. At smaller parties, a fraternity member will check the list. On alcohol, the rules say that beer can be served in unopened cans and that wine can be served if visibly poured by a sober fraternity member. Prohibited are \"pre-mixed drinks, punches, or any other common source of alcohol.\" That means no beer kegs. Hard liquor can be served at large events if a fraternity hires a bartender through a company with a state license, or at smaller events if bottles are placed at a bar overseen by a sober monitor. The documents released today make scant mention of laws against serving alcohol to people under the age of 21. Underlying the rules there appears to be an assumption that college students will drink at parties, regardless of the law, and that the university should try to make those parties as safe as possible.",

Every day there\u2019s at least one moment where we want to hurl our computers through a window, because the sexist coverage of this election does not stop. But we may have hit the motherlode today, with an article that laments Chelsea Clinton \u2014 a working mom \u2014 missing her daughter\u2019s first day of preschool. The article also wonders why her mom, CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, isn\u2019t at home babysitting. \n \n \u201cIt takes a village! Chelsea Clinton\u2019s husband Marc and their nanny take Charlotte to her first day of preschool \u2013 which she misses to campaign for her sick mom,\u201d writes the Daily Mail, in an article that just may be one of the most sexist pieces of garbage you\u2019ve ever read. And that\u2019s saying a lot. A lot. \n \n First of all, a father isn\u2019t a member of \u201cthe village.\u201d He\u2019s a father \u2014 just as capable of handling dropping his kid off at preschool as mom. The article only gets worse after that headline. It actually insinuates that Hillary should be watching her infant grandchild during the drop off. Can you imagine the same being said for Trump and his grandkids? No, you can\u2019t. Because he\u2019s actually admitted that he didn\u2019t even raise his own children. But no one cares about that. He\u2019s a man, entitled to throw money at his kids and call it a day. \n \n \u201cCharlotte, who will turn two at the end of the month, was seen heading to her Manhattan school in a stroller being pushed by her nanny while her father Marc Mezvinsky was on his phone,\u201d the article reads.

Big whoop. \u201cHer mother could not be there for the big day however because she was on the campaign trail for her mother in North Carolina,\u201d garbage continues. \u201cGrandma Hillary also missed Charlotte\u2019s first day of school as she was recovering from pneumonia at her home in nearby Chappaqua.\u201d In case you missed it in the bullet points, Grandma Hillary was \u201cunable to join Charlotte or watch baby Aidan.\u201d \n \n Fox 32 Chicago decided to get in on the shaming this morning, and asked its readers this: \n \n \u201cSOUND OFF\u2026 Should Chelsea Clinton have been there for her daughters first day? Or is it acceptable for one parent to drop the child off?\u201d What planet are we on? How many households have families where both parents can make it to school drop off? That\u2019s not even really a thing. The whole purpose of this article and and subsequent coverage is to remind women that they are somehow going against nature by not being a mom first, all the time. \n \n That message is exhausting. And it\u2019s bullshit. \n \n Hillary Clinton is running for the office of President of the United States. We don\u2019t need to be constantly reminded that she\u2019s a grandma \u2014 especially one who\u2019s expected to babysit. Imagine these sentences written about any male candidate in the history of ever. You can\u2019t. It hasn\u2019t happened. It would never happen. \n \n Here\u2019s what happened this morning: a father took his kid to preschool. The end. This is not news. What it is, is a harmful addition to the constant sexist message women are sent: your \u201cjob\u201d will never be as important as your role as a mother \u2014 and if you try to do both you will always be failing. \n \n Well, fuck that.

Blankfein, one of the first investors. \n \n The flagship fund currently manages $330 million and is down 1 percent this year. \n \n Mezvinsky was long gone from his job at Goldman in October 2013 when his mother-in-law Hillary was paid to give a speech to executives at the company during a technology conference in Arizona. \n \n She was reportedly paid $225,000 for that appearance. \n \n Having some fun: The two enjoyed an animated conversation outside the resturant \n \n Having a lugh|: mezvisnky could be seen laughin g as the two enjoyed an hour-and-a-half lunch \n \n Just for the taste of it: He sipped on some Diet Coke for his meal with his friend \n \n Heading off: Marc and his friend went on their separate ways after the lunch \n \n Shortly after starting Eagleville, Mezvinsky and Chelsea moved into a $10million New York City apartment opposite Madison Square Park. \n \n The four-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot apartment is one of only four residences in the building, which despite the low occupancy rate still has a full-time doorman. \n \n The apartment, whose hallways stretch a full city block, also has two dishwashers, two washer and dryers, dressing rooms with double-sided vanity mirrors, and two massive walk-in closets. \n \n The bedrooms meanwhile face right into Vera Wang's bridal design studio, who designed Cheslea's dress for her wedding day. \n \n Chelsea, 36, has stayed busy this past year campaigning for her mother while also working for the Clinton Foundation. \n \n She took a brief break after giving birth to Aiden in June, but was back at it in July when she introduced her mother at the Democratic National Convention. \n \n Chelsea spent Tuesday with students at Wake Forest. ||||| Photo by Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images \n \n While Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign as the first female major-party presidential nominee hardly represents the end of sexism as we know it, there is plenty of evidence of progress. As Clinton battles her opponent, courts donors, and presents informed policy positions, it becomes harder and harder to imagine a time when the world saw her political competence and ambition as an anomaly and preferred instead to focus on her cookie-baking skills. \n \n But a recent side-eyed takedown of Chelsea Clinton in the Daily Mail for missing her daughter Charlotte\u2019s first day of school suggests that the decline in interest in Hillary\u2019s domestic bona fides may have less to do with evolving attitudes on the responsibilities of mothers, and more to do with the fact that the presidential nominee no longer has school-aged children at home. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n The Mail's story on Chelsea\u2019s great transgression is an remarkably unselfconscious example of mom-shaming. Let\u2019s begin with the headline: \u201cIt takes a village! Chelsea Clinton\u2019s husband Marc and their nanny take Charlotte to her first day of preschool\u2014which she misses to campaign for her sick mom.\u201d You know who else Marc is besides Chelsea\u2019s husband? Charlotte\u2019s father, originator of half of her DNA, equal participant in her creation, and equal shareholder in her well-being. \n \n The handy bullet points that the Mail places on top of their stories are written in the same \u201cbad mommy!\u201d spirit. In them, the tabloid emphasizes again that it was not-yet-two-year-old Charlotte\u2019s apparently momentous first day of school. They then point out that Chelsea had to miss it because she is campaigning in North Carolina in place of her mother who \u201cwas also unable to join Charlotte or watch baby Aidan because she is recovering from pneumonia at her home in Chappaqua.\u201d (Because if she wasn\u2019t sick, of course Hillary would spend a Monday morning with her grandchildren seven weeks before the election.) They end their summary by making it quite clear as to why dads are no substitute for moms: \u201cMarc was seen on his phone while he and the nanny took Charlotte to school\u201d and \u201c[a]fter dropping Charlotte off, Marc enjoyed lunch for an hour-and-a-half with a friend.\u201d Later in the story, we learn that all this took place while son Aidan was \u201cpresumably home with another nanny.\u201d Presumably, but with mom far away, grandma sick, and dad off palling around and sipping Diet Coke with one of his \u201cboys,\u201d we\u2019ll never know for certain. \n \n Earlier this morning, Fox 32 Chicago posted the Daily Mail story on their Facebook page, asking their readers to \u201csound off\u201d on whether or not Chelsea Clinton should have been there for her daughter\u2019s first day of school. Was that a major parenting miss, or \u201cis it acceptable for one parent to drop the child off? The best responses will go on air!\u201d Wisely, the station has since deleted the post, which leaves us without an answer to these particular queries, but does provide an answer to the larger question of whether or not anyone should be inquiring into such matters in the first place. They shouldn\u2019t. \n \n The fact is, this discussion would have never occurred in the first place if Chelsea were a guy. Male Chelsea\u2019s absence at drop-off would simply not register as news, thanks to the fact that fathers have never been accountable for being there for their children at all times. Moms, on the other hand, are always accountable, even when not physically present. Trump\u2019s announcement of a maternity leave policy, as opposed to a family leave policy, is a testament to the fact that such thinking is alive and well. ||||| ... \n \n kissing, snuggling and hugging hedgehogs.

Baby brother Aidan was \"presumably home with another nanny,\" the paper speculated, while publishing a photo of Ivanka Trump and husband Jared Kushner walking daughter Arabella to her first day of kindergarten. The Mail goes on to chronicle Mezvinsky's day, noting that he was on his phone while with Charlotte and that he later \"enjoyed lunch for an hour-and-a-half\" with a friend, suggesting that dads can't quite cut it while filling in for moms. Slate's Elissa Strauss calls the article a \"remarkably unselfconscious example of mom-shaming.\" Maria Guido fumes on Scary Mommy: \"The whole purpose of this article and subsequent coverage is to remind women that they are somehow going against nature by not being a mom first, all the time.\" A Chicago TV station invited readers on its Facebook page to \"sound off\" on whether it was OK for Clinton to skip the drop-off.

    "document": "In the immediate aftermath of the targeted killing of Osama bin Laden, President Obama\u2019s approval rating has jumped higher, with big increases in the number of Americans giving him high marks on dealing with terrorism and the situation in Afghanistan. \n \n But the new poll, conducted Monday evening by The Washington Post and the Pew Research Center, also finds virtually no movement in Obama\u2019s numbers when it comes to handling the economy. That suggests that success on one front \u2014 even one as important as the death of the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks \u2014 might not translate easily to other areas. \n \n Overall, 56 percent of those polled say they approve of the way Obama is handling his job as president, an increase of nine percentage points over April polls by Post-ABC News and Pew. That is the highest approval rating for the president in either poll since 2009. \n \n There\u2019s also been a clear increase in public satisfaction with the way things are going in the United States, although by a margin of nearly 2-1, Americans are still dissatisfied with the direction of the country. \n \n The president gets big bounces on dealing with Afghanistan, with his approval rating soaring to 60 percent, and on handling the threat of terrorism, where he recorded a career high of 69 percent. \n \n More than three-quarters of all Americans say the president deserves credit for the killing of the bin Laden in Pakistan on Sunday. Among Republicans, 61 percent say Obama deserves at least some credit for the move. But just 17 percent of them say he deserves a \u201cgreat deal\u201d of credit for bringing bin Laden to justice after a nearly 10-year pursuit by U.S. intelligence and military forces. \n \n Republicans are more apt to give former president George W. Bush acclaim for killing bin Laden, with 81 percent saying he deserves at least some of the credit for what happened Sunday. Only 35 percent of Democrats share that view, however, with a slender 4 percent giving the former president a lot of credit. \n \n There is more bipartisan agreement that the U.S. military and intelligence deserve a great deal of credit for the killing. \n \n For the president, the nine-point increase in his overall approval rating is on par with the six-point increase in Bush\u2019s numbers in the weeks following the capture of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in December 2003. Then, as now, political independents moved the most. \n \n Compared with the mid-April Post-ABC poll, Obama\u2019s approval rating among independents is now 10 points higher, at 52 percent. Bush got an identical 10-point boost among independents in December 2003. For Bush, that lift proved short-lived, with the entire increase gone within six weeks. \n \n How long Obama\u2019s improved ratings will last is, of course, an open question. The fact that there was no movement in Obama\u2019s approval on the economy \u2014 still the top issue by far in the country \u2014 offers a reminder of the challenges that remain for the White House. Obama\u2019s 40 percent approval on the economy in this one-night poll is the lowest of his presidency in Washington Post polls, though it has been numerically lower in Pew surveys. \n \n The Post-Pew poll was conducted by conventional landline and cellular telephone Monday evening, and included interviews with 654 randomly selected adults. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. \n \n Polling manager Peyton M. Craighill also contributed to this report. ||||| While the public lauds the president\u2019s performance killing Bin Laden, he got no overall bounce in a new Newsweek/Daily Beast poll. Also: Obama vs. Bush on terror and Obama vs. Trump in 2012. Plus, full coverage of Osama bin Laden. \n \n \n \n How much overall boost did President Obama get from the capture of Osama Bin Laden? None, according to an exclusive Newsweek / Daily Beast poll encompassing 1,200 American adults, conducted in the two days immediately before the president\u2019s Sunday announcement about the terrorist leader, and then the two days immediately after. \n \n Specifically, Americans like the way he handled the situation, giving him strong results in strength and decision-making (55 percent now term him a strong leader overall, and 63 percent do so in the area of terrorism). Yet he did not get any overall bump in terms of approval rating, or electoral support. His approval rate was unchanged\u201448 approve, 49 disapprove, both before and after. There was also no statistical change in whether Obama deserves reelection\u201440/48 before, 39/49 after. \n \n Photos: Inside bin Laden\u2019s Compound \n \n The clear reason: It's the economy, stupid. Even after Bin Laden\u2019s death, only 30 percent think the country is on the right track, and only 27 percent think the economy is on the right track. Respondents disapprove of President Obama's handling of the economy by a margin of 56 percent to 39 percent. \n \n When compared to President George W. Bush, 48 percent of respondents say Obama deserves more credit for the death of Bin Laden, while 31 percent say Bush. Yet when asked who did better prosecuting the war on terror, even after the killing, the results are nearly reversed: 31 percent say Obama, 45 percent say Bush. \n \n Meanwhile, in terms of the putting the birther issue to rest, while Donald Trump was close to Obama a month ago, the president now crushes the tycoon/reality star, 53 percent to 25 percent.

Brad Wenstrup, whose district includes the area where Warmbier went to high school, tweeted on Friday that his office was asking the State Department \u201cto assist however possible in getting Mr. Warmbier home.\u201d \n \n Further official comment was not immediately available as U.S. government offices were closed ahead of an impending blizzard. \n \n Johnson said China-based Young Pioneer Tours was in contact with Warmbier\u2019s family and U.S. officials. \n \n \u201cWe are in touch with Otto\u2019s family, the U.S. State Department and the Embassy of Sweden in Pyongyang and doing all we can to secure his release,\u201d Johnson told Reuters. \n \n The Swedish Embassy represents U.S. interests in North Korea. \n \n KCNA said Warmbier had entered the country with an \u201caim to destroy the country\u2019s unity\u201d. It did not elaborate. \n \n According to his social media profiles, Warmbier is from Cincinnati and is an Echols Scholar, awarded to the top 7 percent of incoming first-year students at the University of Virginia, where he majors in economics with a minor in global sustainability. \n \n Warmbier has also visited Cuba, Ireland and Israel, according to his Facebook profile. \n \n Warmbier was detained four days before North Korea conducted its fourth nuclear test in violation of UN sanctions, which drew condemnation from its neighbors and the United States. \n \n A friend and former high-school classmate of Warmbier, who wished to remain anonymous, told Reuters: \u201cOtto is a wonderful, warm person who should never have to go through anything like this. ... The idea that any of this happened is crazy.\u201d \n \n Calls to the Warmbier home in Cincinnati, Ohio, were not immediately answered on Friday and nobody answered when a Reuters reporter knocked on the door of the house. \n \n South Korea warned that the United States and its allies were working on further sanctions to inflict \u201cbone-numbing pain\u201d on North Korea after its latest nuclear test, and urged China to do its part to rein in its neighbor. \n \n North Korea has a long history of detaining foreigners, and the U.S. and Canadian governments advise against travel there. \n \n Pyongyang has in the past used detained U.S. citizens to extract high-profile visits from the United States, with which it has no formal diplomatic relations. \n \n While the vast majority of tourists to North Korea are from China, roughly 6,000 westerners visit the country annually. Most are adventure-seekers curious about life behind the last sliver of the iron curtain, and ignore critics who say their dollars prop up a repressive regime. \n \n Warmbier was on Young Pioneer\u2019s \u201cNew Year\u2019s Party Tour,\u201d which, according to the itinerary on the company\u2019s website, was to include watching fireworks in Kim Il Sung Square in the heart of Pyongyang, and an optional helicopter ride. \n \n A South Korean-born Canadian pastor was arrested in North Korea last year and given a life sentence for subversion. This month, a Korean-American told CNN in Pyongyang he was being held by the state for spying. \n \n In 2014, Pyongyang released three detained Americans. Last October, it freed a South Korean national with a U.S. green card after holding him for six months. ||||| Image copyright Facebook \n \n North Korea says it has arrested a US student accused of committing a \"hostile act\" against the state. \n \n State news agency KCNA identified him as University of Virginia student Otto Frederick Warmbier. \n \n He had entered North Korea as a tourist with the intention \"to destroy the country's unity\", said KCNA, which added that the US government had \"tolerated and manipulated\" him. \n \n It did not give further details, but said he was now under investigation. \n \n The US State Department is \"aware of media reports that a US citizen was detained in North Korea\" and is working with its protecting power, the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang, Deputy Spokesperson Mark Toner said. \n \n He said that no further information would be shared at this time due to privacy concerns. \n \n North Korea sometimes uses the detention of foreigners as a means of exerting pressure on its adversaries. \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption The incident follows escalating tensions with rivals including the US and South Korea \n \n Detained on tour \n \n China-based tour agency Young Pioneer Tours released a statement confirming that Mr Warmbier had been detained while on one of their tours in Pyongyang, and said his family had been informed. \n \n It had earlier told Reuters that Mr Warmbier was arrested on 2 January. \n \n \"We are in contact with the Swedish Embassy... who are working with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to address the case.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n By Lucy Bayly \n \n President Donald Trump renewed his attack on the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, accusing his own appointee, Chairman Jerome \"Jay\" Powell, of stunting the nation's economic growth. \n \n \"It almost looks like he's happy raising interest rates,\" said Trump in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published late Tuesday. \n \n He also said he \"maybe\" regretted nominating Powell to the position, noting that \"I have a hot economy going,\" and that \"every time we do something great, he raises the interest rates.\" \n \n The biggest risk to the economy was not tariffs, said Trump, nor an escalating trade war, nor punitive measures related to tensions with Saudi Arabia over the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, but rather the fact that the Fed is raising interest rates too quickly. \n \n Trump compared his presidency to that of Barack Obama, taking care to point out that Obama operated with \"zero interest\" rates from the Fed, which held rates artificially low for almost a decade in order to allow the economy to grow after the 2008 recession. \n \n \u201cHow the hell do you compete with that?\" Trump noted. \n \n The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates by one-quarter point three times this year, with a fourth increase likely slated for December as monetary policymakers seek to temper credit demand. \n \n Powell has made note of the Fed's precarious position as the economy heats up, saying in August that the Fed currently faces two main risks \u2014 either \u201cmoving too fast and needlessly shortening the expansion\" or \"moving too slowly and risking a destabilizing overheating.\" \n \n Tuesday's attack marks the latest in the president's feud with the Fed. Last week, Trump lambasted the chairman, saying \"I'm not happy with what he's doing because it's going too fast.\" \n \n It used to be rare for a sitting president to comment on the Fed, which is supposed to remain immune to political pressure. Trump said last week that he had no intention of firing Powell, and there is no historical precedent for such action. \n \n According to Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act it is technically possible, since \"each member shall hold office for a term of fourteen years from the expiration of the term of his predecessor, unless sooner removed for cause by the President.\" ||||| President Trump has put the Federal Reserve at the middle of the latest drop in the markets, saying the \"Fed has gone crazy.\" WSJ global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath explores three reasons why the Fed is raising interest rates.

He also told the newspaper that it was \"too early to tell, but maybe\" he regretted nominating Powell to the position. \n \n The criticism echoes comments Trump made last week in an interview with Fox Business in which he said that the Fed is his \"biggest threat.\" \n \n Michelle Smith, a spokeswoman for the Fed, declined to comment on Trump's remarks Tuesday. \n \n Presidents have for decades refrained from commenting on the Fed, a stance adopted to avoid compromising its independence \u2014 and its credibility with financial markets. \n \n In the run-up to the midterms, Trump has pitched voters on his stewardship of the economy. He threw Washington into a frenzy this week by promising to introduce a fresh round of tax cuts before the midterms , expanding on last year's landmark tax reform. \n \n But the president has lately expressed frustration with the Fed's gradual interest rate increases, designed to slow down the economy and prevent inflation from taking off \u2014 standard macroeconomic steps that Trump insists are undercutting his expansionary fiscal moves. \n \n Earlier this month, as investors dumped stocks amid concerns over rising interest rates, Trump said the central bank was \"going loco\" and \"out of control.\" \n \n Obama comparison \n \n Trump complained to the Journal on Tuesday that former President Barack Obama \u2014 who came into office amid the worst recession in decades \u2014 didn't have to deal with the burden of rising interest rates. \n \n \"I'm just saying this: I'm very unhappy with the Fed because Obama had zero interest rates,\" Trump told the paper. \n \n After the financial crisis erupted in 2008, the Fed kept rates at historically low levels to revive the ailing economy. It started slowly raising rates again in 2015 as the economy regained strength under Obama, and has hiked them six times since Trump took office. Three of those increases were under Powell, a sitting Fed governor widely respected on Wall Street whom Trump chose to succeed Obama's pick, Janet Yellen. \n \n Before he picked Powell, however, Trump teased the possibility of renominating Yellen , crediting her with helping boost the stock market. \n \n As with other personnel changes, the president made his Fed pick something of a reality show, asking Fox anchor Lou Dobbs for his recommendation in a televised interview. (Dobbs endorsed Yellen.) \n \n Yellen says Fed criticism is unwise \n \n Economists have generally given Powell high marks on his performance, arguing the Fed is acting wisely by gradually returning monetary policy to normal levels after the worst recession in 75 years. \n \n The central bank is trying to cool down the red-hot economy after Washington's debt-fueled tax cuts and spending surge. The rate hikes are also designed to give it room to provide support for the economy whenever the next downturn arrives. That's especially important because the federal government's soaring budget deficit could make it harder to borrow to fight a recession. \n \n Yellen defended his performance in remarks last week at a mortgage bankers conference in Washington and suggested Trump should back off. \n \n \"I really think it is not a desirable thing for a president to comment so explicitly on Fed policy,\" she said. \"Obviously, presidents can speak out if they choose to and give their opinions about policy, there's no law against that, but I don't think it's wise and I do think the Fed has a strong reputation for acting in an independent and non-political way and I would not like to see that reputation damaged.\" \n \n That view was repeated the same week by Trump's former top economic adviser Gary Cohn \u2014 who was also once considered a candidate to chair the Fed under Trump. \n \n When asked on CNBC if he thought the president should be weighing in, Cohn replied: \"I don't think he should be making comments on any federal agency.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Framing the state of the economy in personal terms, referring to \"my numbers,\" President Trump blasted Fed chief Jerome Powell and the central bank itself in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Trump called the Fed the \"biggest risk\" to the economy, due to the three times it's raised interest rates this year; it will likely do so a fourth time in December. Trump lamented Powell \"was supposed to be a low-interest-rate guy. It's turned out that he's not,\" adding that Powell \"almost looks like he's happy\" when he raises the rates. Trump also seemed irritated that during former President Obama's tenure in the White House, interest rates hovered near zero. The Journal explains the Fed has been increasing the benchmark rate as a move to control inflation and keep financial bubbles at bay. CNN, meanwhile, notes the \"historically low\" interest rates under Obama were needed to jump-start a post-recession economy. Still, Trump told the Journal that while it's \"too early to say,\" he \"maybe\" isn't so sure he should have nominated Powell. \"I don't know,\" he said when asked in what scenario he'd remove his Fed head, a move for which NBC News notes there's no precedent. \"I'm just saying this: I'm very unhappy with the Fed.\" Both former Fed chief Janet Yellen and ex-Trump economic adviser Gary Cohn say the president should ease up on the central bank, traditionally an independent entity, per CNN.

(AAPL) is starting an iPhone trade-in program this month aimed at getting users to upgrade to the iPhone 5 and turn in older models, people with knowledge of the plans said. \n \n Apple has teamed up with Brightstar Corp., a mobile-phone distributor, to run the exchange program, said the people, who asked not to be identified because Apple hasn\u2019t publicly announced the plan. \n \n Brightstar also handles trade-ins for AT&T Inc. (T) and T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS), as well as other carriers and device makers, amid brisk demand for refurbished iPhone 4s and 4Ss in emerging markets. By offering money for older smartphones, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook is seeking to entice consumers to upgrade to the latest models, part of the company\u2019s efforts to reignite sales growth and combat declining shares. \n \n \u201cThis will help them sell more phones, because it will lower the consumer\u2019s out-of-pocket expense,\u201d said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics LLC in Dedham, Massachusetts. \n \n Amy Bessette, a spokeswoman for Cupertino, California-based Apple, and Patrick Foarde, a Brightstar spokesman who works for Ketchum Inc., declined to comment. \n \n AT&T is currently paying as much as $200 for working iPhone 4s and 4Ss, which could let some customers buy an entry-level iPhone 5 for no money down.

That\u2019s changing as Apple\u2019s growth has slowed in recent quarters. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) became the best-selling smartphone brand in the U.S. in May, T. Michael Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Inc., wrote in a report this week. \n \n Apple sold 37.4 million units of the iPhone in the latest quarter, compared with 35.1 million a year earlier. Apple shares have declined 38 percent from a record in September, weighed down by investor concerns that the company\u2019s era of rapid growth, fueled by the 2007 debut of the iPhone, may be over. \n \n While Cook has said some \u201cgame changer\u201d consumer electronics products are in development, Apple is still trading at an 13 percent discount to Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung on a price-to-earnings basis, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apple shares rose less than 1 percent to $441.81 at the close in New York, leaving them down 17 percent this year. \n \n Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg By offering money for older smartphones, including iPhone 4S smartphones, seen here, Apple Inc. and the wireless companies are seeking to entice consumers to upgrade to the latest models, while profiting through resales abroad.

Read More Close Open Photographer: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Bloomberg By offering money for older smartphones, including iPhone 4S smartphones, seen here, Apple Inc. and the wireless companies are seeking to entice consumers to upgrade to the latest models, while profiting through resales abroad. \n \n Emerging Markets \n \n Samsung has become a market leader by offering smartphones based on Google Inc. (GOOG)\u2019s Android mobile operating system, which captured 75 percent of the market in the first quarter, compared with 17 percent for phones running Apple\u2019s iOS software, according to IDC. \n \n Trade-in programs are used to support sales of new hardware in mature markets such as the U.S., where many prospective customers already own a smartphone. Used iPhones collected in the U.S. will only be resold in emerging markets, where Apple\u2019s share is lower and demand for cheap devices is greater, said one of the people. That way, the resale of Apple\u2019s older models won\u2019t cannibalize iPhone 5 sales in the U.S., the person said. \n \n Selling used iPhones in emerging markets may also keep first-time smartphone buyers around the world from committing to Android, buying time for Apple to introduce new models. \n \n \u201cThe overall size of this market is increasing rapidly,\u201d said Israel Ganot, chief executive officer of Gazelle Inc., an online mobile device trade-in company. \n \n Global Demand \n \n Apple runs a Web-based recycling service, in a partnership with Roseville, California-based PowerOn Services Inc., offering to pay people for their used iPhones, iPads or Macs. The new trade-in program with BrightStar will only be available at Apple\u2019s retail outlets, letting consumers receive payments instantly and avoid the hassle of shipping their older gadgets, the people said. \n \n Apple also worked with Brightstar to help AT&T and T-Mobile with their recent trade-in promotions, said the people. Brightstar set up its trade-in division a year ago and is on track to buy and resell more than 15 million devices this year, according to Bela Lainck, president of the buyback and trade-in business at Miami-based Brightstar. \n \n The company collects 80 percent of its used devices in the U.S., and resells most of them through distribution centers in 50 countries, Lainck said in an interview in late May. Brightstar also owns an auction house in Hong Kong, and a division that provides refurbished phones to insurers seeking inventory for clients who have lost or broken a smartphone. \n \n Installed Based \n \n \u201cThe iPhone is an iconic device that people around the world want to own,\u201d said David Edmondson, CEO of eRecyclingCorp, another trade-in processor. \u201cIf they can\u2019t afford a new Mercedes, they\u2019ll get a used one.\u201d \n \n Getting more people to buy iPhones -- whether new or used - - is also becoming more important as Apple starts to introduce services that are delivered via mobile devices, according to Walter Piecyk, an analyst at BTIG LLC. \n \n Cook, who has also hinted that new services were being developed in addition to new hardware, is planning to introduce a new music-streaming service at Apple\u2019s annual developers\u2019 conference in San Francisco on June 10, people familiar with the matter said this week. \n \n \u201cThe key is to get iPhones into as many people\u2019s hands as possible,\u201d Piecyk, who is based in New York, said in an interview. \u201cSelling used phones is one way to do that.\u201d \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Peter Burrows in San Francisco at pburrows@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net ||||| For the first time ever, Apple will let users trade in their old iPhones for new ones, according to Bloomberg's sources \u2014 an indication of just how much the company's market positioning has dwindled the launch of the iPhone 5... and the re-birth of Samsung's mobile dominance. Those looking to get rid of their iPhones will soon be able to head into Apple stores and turn them in for a discount on a newer model. It's a pretty sweet set-up for someone who has an old iPhone and wants a new one. But it's also a genius plot for Apple to increase their market share in the places it most needs help. \n \n First, Apple gets to retain those loyal customers already using an iPhone \u2014 you know, the ones who see that fancy Samsung Galaxy S IV with its big bright screen and think they want to switch. Apple has never had to give customers an incentive to buy a new version of the iPhone, and it's never had to run an exchange program like so many cellphone providers have for years; then again, Apple's never faced competition like it is from Samsung right now. Either the upgrade incentive was obvious \u2014 of course an iPhone 3G owner would get the iPhone 4 \u2014 or most self-respecting dumb phone owners getting into the market would choose an Apple phone over the other options. But even since the iPhone 5 hit the market in September, those expectations have changed wildly: The iPhone has been losing user loyalty while Samsung has kept gaining on Apple. A recent report found that Samsung passed Apple in the U.S. cellphone market \u2014 at least for now. That could all change once Apple announces another new phone \u2014 people tend to hold off on upgrades until the next big unveil out of Cupertino. But with the walls starting to close in a bit, it won't hurt for Apple to start nudging people in that direction. \n \n Second, the new trade-in plan reflects Apple's attempt to position itself in emerging markets, where your average cellphone customer doesn't want to spend upwards of $200 on a device. In addition to the rumored cheap iPhone, which looks more alive than ever with Apple's Foxconn breakup, the upgrade program is a great way to get lower-priced devices to people who want them. The used gadgets will only be sold in countries with demand for a cheaper set, the sources told Bloomberg's Peter Burrows. The older models won't be used as replacement devices for customers with broken iPhones, a practice that angered consumers in China so much that Apple changed its warranty policy there. This latest ploy, which won't be available at your local provider store, is just another way Apple could increase market share in those overseas markets, where it hasn't had as much success because the iPhone remains just too damn expensive. \n \n Want to add to this story?

The goring was broadcast live on television and news of his death stirred widespread reaction ranging from the bullfighting community to well-known politicians. \"My condolences to the family and colleagues of Victor Barrio, the deceased bullfighter this evening in Teruel. Rest in Peace,\" Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy tweeted. Prominent bullfighter Enrique Ponce said he was \"deeply saddened by the death of my colleague in the ring. Let God embrace him in all his glory. Great matador.\" Participants at the famed running of the bulls at the San Fermin festival in Pamplona wore improvised black armbands in honor of the fallen matador while dashing along the streets on the way to the bullring on Sunday morning. Festivities in Teruel were immediately suspended following Barrio's death.",

    "document": "Buy Photo Beekeeper Lloyd Cunniff said his hive boxes are typically filled \"wall-to-wall.\" Since the stolen hives have been recovered, the bee populations have been failing. (Photo: (TRIBUNE PHOTO/SEABORN LARSON))Buy Photo \n \n When a Choteau beekeeper lost his hives to bee rustlers in California in January, he expected he\u2019d never see them again. What he did expect, after speaking with the California beekeeping community, was that Ukrainian-Russians may have been behind the bee heist. \n \n And they were right. A pair of Ukranian-Russians have been charged with possession of stolen property \u2013 over $150,000 in beekeeping equipment, his hives included \u2013 in an agriculture law enforcement sting that could draw attention from federal authorities. \n \n Choteau beekeeper Lloyd Cunniff reported his bees stolen in mid-January, after his 488 hives vanished from a property in California. Cunniff, and many more beekeepers during this time of year, had transported his bees to California for the almond pollination season. \n \n On Sunday following the work of an agriculture crime task force and the local beekeepers community, most of Cunniff\u2019s equipment had returned to the Treasure State. \n \n \u201cWe got about two-thirds of the equipment back,\u201d he told the Tribune on Thursday. \n \n Cunniff's honey bee operations is about six miles north of Choteau, within eyeshot of the Rocky Mountain Front. But he's keeping his recovered bees in a fresh green field a ways south of town, in case they are infected with disease or mites. He said determining whether or not the recovered hives and bees can still be used will take time and he won't know for sure until fall. For now, he\u2019s quarantined the bees away from his new hives and will continue to monitor the bees\u2019 health as he sprints to recover the lost income he had planned on from almond season in California. \n \n In January, Cunniff, owner of Beeline Honey in Choteau, was one of about 10 victims across seven California counties in which Fresno County law enforcement believes Ukrainian-Russians have turned to agriculture thefts, particularly bees, to fund organized crime rings. \n \n \u201cFor us, it\u2019s kind of new to us, too,\u201d said Fresno County Detective Anders Solis, a member of the county\u2019s agriculture crimes task force that handled Cunniff\u2019s case. \u201cThis has been going on for about three years.\u201d \n \n Most of the bee rustling has reportedly occurred north, in Sacramento County, Solis said. Cunniff\u2019s bees were stolen from a property even further north, in Yuba City, California. An ongoing investigation by the Ag Task Force reportedly found that Ukrainian-Russians were often stealing bees from each other. \n \n \u201cUsually they\u2019ll steal from each other, then if they steal a large amount, they\u2019ll steal from American companies and people like Lloyd,\u201d Solis said during a phone interview Thursday. \u201cThere were victims that were Russian-Ukrainian, also.\u201d \n \n There are plenty of Ukrainian-Russians running legitimate bee operations, Solis said. So, naturally, much of the Ukrainian-Russian community is angry with those who make them look bad in the overall farming and ranching community. \n \n \u201cFrom talking to a lot of the Russian beekeepers, they say (the alleged Ukrainian-Russian thefts) give them a bad name and farmers won\u2019t trust them,\u201d Solis said. \u201cAll of the (Russian) victims we\u2019ve dealt with have been pretty forthcoming.\u201d \n \n Solis said for years, these theft numbers have gone up around January right before the almond tree pollination, and mostly around Sacramento, where Cunniff\u2019s bees disappeared. \n \n When Cunniff\u2019s bees vanished into the night back in January, he believed the rustlers were organized based on the two sets of 2-ton semi-trailer truck tracks pointed away from the scene. He also feared he\u2019d never see them again. The hives and equipment were brand new and not marked by any identifying images, like his business name, phone number or address. \n \n \u201cOnce I saw what they do down there, don\u2019t make any difference if they\u2019re stenciled (with identifying marks) or not,\u201d Cunniff said. \u201cThey take it and paint over it.\u201d \n \n Then, a couple weeks ago, the Fresno County Ag Task Force caught a break. One of the American hired hands on one of the Ukrainian-Russian bee farms noticed one of the hives matched the description of the hives reported by a friend in Missouri. The Missouri beekeeper flew over to California, contacted local law enforcement with matching photos of his stolen hives, and the investigation picked up quickly. \n \n Law enforcement officials found three locations connected to the alleged thieves: a bee nursery space the suspects had reportedly rented, a cow pasture owned by a person not related to the suspects (\u201cThey were basically out there trespassing,\u201d Solis said) and a third property along a freeway, where the hives had been hidden in a drainage. \n \n Fresno county detectives uncovered hives from 10 different victims on the properties and made two arrests, charging two men with possession of stolen property. More arrests and charges may be coming, as the investigation is still ongoing, Solis said. \n \n \u201cAs it develops we may be have to get to the theft charges,\u201d Solis said. \u201cThere\u2019s a few things we need to get with the original agencies. Federal has interest in the case because of the monetary value, the fact that it may be organized crime and there\u2019s been some leads that the suspects were contacted in North Dakota and there were hives in that location.\u201d \n \n Of the $224,000 worth of bees and equipment reported stolen, about $170,000 worth was recovered, about consistent with the two-thirds return Cunniff estimated. While some parts were never found, many hives were simply so damaged that they\u2019ve become unusable. \n \n \u201cI think it really affected Lloyd in particular,\u201d Solis said. \n \n Much of the equipment is mixed-and-matched with different pieces, Cunniff said. Some of the hives aren\u2019t even fully assembled anymore. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s just totally mixed up,\u201d Cunniff said. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest mess you\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d \n \n Cunniff last week received a photo from a California beekeeper who was working with law enforcement. Although Cunniff\u2019s hives were not marked, he said he recognized the nearly new equipment and custom-built handles he had fashioned onto the hives. So he flew down on May 2 and identified the hives as his. They had been found in all three locations. After hiring a few trucking operations to get the bees back to Montana, Cunniff\u2019s hives were back in Choteau on Sunday. \n \n Cunniff and Solis said the bee thieves used his bees in the almond tree pollination, like Cunniff had planned. Cunniff estimates the bee thieves earned about $100,000 in the process. \n \n So despite having his bees back, he feels like the score isn\u2019t yet settled. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t feel any justice until the guy ends up in jail,\u201d he said, looking for a conviction. \u201cBut it is nice to get the equipment back. We put a lot of time and money into it.\u201d \n \n Since his things were stolen, Cunniff\u2019s insurance company had covered the costs for him to get his operation started again, providing the funds to get more bees from California, as well as a semi-truck load of new bees, about 508 new hives in total. So when Cunniff told the insurance company his bees had been found, they actually told him to leave them in California. But since more than half of his hives were recovered, Cunniff decided to see what he could do. \n \n \u201cIt just ended up being so much stuff, we couldn\u2019t leave it down there,\u201d he said. \n \n Cunniff still plans to truck his bees down to California for the almond pollination next summer, although he said he\u2019ll be more cautious about leaving the bees there for extended periods of time. Cunniff said he\u2019ll have to wait and see if his recovered bees will still be able to produce honey, which he won\u2019t know until fall. By then, the bees will have died off if they are in fact diseased. If the bees survive, he\u2019ll negotiate with the insurance company, who technically owns the recovered bees, to buy them back. \n \n \u201cThey left it up to us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s not worth anything, then we\u2019ll walk away from it.\u201d \n \n He has hardly been able to monitor the recovered bees anyway; he\u2019s busy feeding the new colonies, preparing for a honey crop this year. He has to split hives accordingly, making sure enough queens are appropriated to certain colonies, which he feeds with a mixture of liquid sugar and water. \n \n Coming off a winter with more snowfall than the two years before, Cunniff said conditions are ripe for a healthy, hearty honey crop this year. All in all, Cunniff said it looks like his business should have a pretty sweet summer. \n \n \"We've been getting spring rain, a bit at a time,\" he said. \"Things are looking really good.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/2qBV4Hz ||||| GREAT FALLS, Montana (AP) \u2014 A Montana beekeeper has recovered hives that were stolen from him in California, thanks to an agricultural sting operation. \n \n Lloyd Cunniff of Choteau reported 488 hives stolen in January, after he had transported them to California for the almond pollination season. \n \n A tip led Fresno County authorities to find stolen hives worth $170,000 in a rented bee nursery space, a cow pasture and hidden in a drainage along a freeway. \n \n Fresno County Detective Anders Solis, member of the county's agriculture crimes task force, says there were 10 victims in seven California counties in all. \n \n The Great Falls Tribune reports (http://gftrib.com/2pvUzhM ) Cunniff got most of his bees back last Sunday.

    "document": "WOBURN, Mass. (AP) \u2014 The highly-anticipated opening of a time capsule that been hidden in the head of a lion statue atop a historical landmark for more than a century yielded at least one surprise Thursday: a hardcover book. \n \n FILE - In this Sept. 14, 2014 file photo, a lion statue is removed from atop the Old State House on Washington Street in Boston. The Bostonian Society on Thursday Oct. 9, 2014 hopes to delicately remove... (Associated Press) \n \n The Bostonian Society had expected the time capsule to include letters, newspaper clippings and other items from 1901, the year it was placed in the statue on the Old State House. Papers were found, along with the red book inside the copper box roughly the size of a modern shoebox. The book had no visible markings, and nothing was taken out of the box because of the items' fragile condition. So, the contents of the book remain a mystery, for now. \n \n The inside of the box and its contents \u2014 there was no mold or water damage \u2014 thrilled society President Brian LeMay. \n \n LeMay said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the conditions inside the box. \n \n The time capsule was sealed inside the lion's head since 1901 and then forgotten \u2014 until recently. Rumors of its existence were confirmed last month when the statue was taken down from the Old State House for refurbishing. \n \n The delicate removal of the box took place at a sculpting studio in suburban Woburn. \n \n Robert Shure, owner of Skylight Studio, first removed a crown atop the copper and gold-leaf lion's head, cut cables holding the box in place inside the head, and removed the rectangular box, which weighed between five and 10 pounds and measured 8-by-12 inches in length and about 6 inches deep, according to Shure. \n \n The society, which manages the Old State House, first learned about the possible existence of the time capsule years ago from the great-great-granddaughter of Samuel Rogers, a craftsman who had worked on building renovations and was believed to have placed the time capsule in the lion's head and catalogued its contents. A 1901 article from The Boston Globe surfaced later, alluding to contents of a copper box \"which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence.\" \n \n Elizabeth Roscio, the Boston Society's archivist, said the box will be brought to an environmentally-controlled setting where the contents can be carefully removed and studied. They will be put on public display at a later date. \n \n One of Boston's most popular tourist attractions, the Old State House has a storied history. It was once the seat of English rule in the northern colonies, and the original lion statue and an accompanying unicorn statue symbolized the unification of England and Scotland. \n \n It was just outside the building that British regulars opened fire on a crowd of protesters in 1770, killing five people in what would become known as the Boston Massacre. \n \n In the summer of 1776, the newly-signed Declaration of Independence was read for the first time to Bostonians from a balcony of the building, which would later serve as the first seat of Massachusetts government. \n \n The plan is to put a new time capsule in the lion's head, this one made of titanium. The society is currently soliciting suggestions of what to put in it, but said one item will be a medal from the ill-fated 2013 Boston Marathon. ||||| Updated October 9, 2014, 4:30 pm \n \n Onlookers were rapt this morning, as a century-old time capsule that sat inside the lion statue on top of the Old State House was opened during a ceremony in Woburn. \n \n The Bostonian Society, the nonprofit that maintains the Old State House in Boston, said in tweets that their archivist was surprised by the great condition of the items inside, and, in a slightly anticlimactic end to the ceremony, that they would go through the contents later in a \u201ccontrolled environment.\u201d (We\u2019ll update when we know more about the contents.) \n \n We do, however, know what to expect. A Boston Globe report from 1901 provided details as to what was placed inside \u2014 photographs and autographs from top government officials, a population map, a letter from local reporters assigned to cover City Hall, old newspapers, and William McKinley and Teddy Roosevelt campaign buttons. \n \n But the Bostonian Society said on Twitter that a red book was also found, which was not expected. They did not explain further. \n \n The lion and another statue, of a unicorn, both dating back to 1901, were removed from their perches on top of the Old State House at the corner of Washington and State streets for repairs last month. \n \n To gain access to the time capsule, artist Bob Shure of Skylight Studios, who is tasked with refurbishing the statues, removed the lion\u2019s crown and cut the copper bands that were holding the capsule in place inside the lion\u2019s head. \n \n The Bostonian Society is asking the public to suggest what should be left inside a new time capsule using the hashtag #lionandunicorn on social media. \n \n Suggestions so far range from Fenway Park dirt, the new iPhone and a miniature version of the \u201cMake Way for Ducklings\u201d sculpture, to unpaid city parking tickets and Big Dig architectural renderings. \n \n Brian LeMay, the president of the Bostonian Society, told WBUR the organization is already planning to include a Boston Marathon medal, as well as images and documents from the present day. \n \n LaMay says no matter what else ends up going into the new time capsule, his organization has one requirement: \u201cI think one thing we are going to do is make it a little bit easier to get the time capsule out than the one that is in there now.\u201d \n \n Story continues below \n \n Most Popular Expand ||||| Back in 1901, the Superintendent of Boston\u2019s Public Buildings commissioned Samuel D. Rogers, a carpenter, to complete repairs and alterations on the Old State House. In the midst of that job, Rogers also became involved in organizing the contents of the time capsule placed in the head of the building\u2019s lion statue. This Thursday, Oct. 9, Skylight Studios will remove the capsule from the lion\u2019s head, providing a snapshot of what life was like in turn-of-the-previous-century Boston\u2014and, for one Idaho woman, offering some insight into her own family history. \n \n Heidi Rogers Grundhauser, of Chubbuck, Idaho, is Rogers\u2019s great-great granddaughter and a self-proclaimed \u201cgenealogy addict\u201d; she learned about the time capsule when her own father passed along Rogers family heirlooms to her, including Samuel\u2019s letters about the capsule. In 2011, Grundhauser reached out to the Bostonian Society to see if it had ever been opened. \n \n Up until last week, however, the existence of a capsule in the lion\u2019s head was disputed. The Freedom Trail Foundation wasn\u2019t convinced it was there. But for the Bostonian Society, the letters written by Samuel Rogers were all the confirmation they needed. Elizabeth Roscio, the Library and Archives Manager of the Bostonian Society, said that in his letters, Rogers details the newspapers, photographs and autographs that he added to the capsule. \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n \u201cSamuel left a complete list of what was added but I am hoping there will be a few surprises even for myself,\u201d Grundhauser said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m most looking forward to seeing is the life sketch Samuel placed in the box as well as the 200-year history of the Rogers family. I love the detective work, I love piecing together the triumphs and the heartache of my ancestors from the pieces of information left behind.\u201d \n \n Grundhauser\u2019s detective work has already paid off. Her research discovered that Samuel Rodgers was born in 1840, had four children from two wives, served as the superintendent of construction projects ranging from schoolhouses to prisons and served twice in the Civil War. Grundhauser hopes that some of the remaining missing links in her family history will be connected when her great-great grandfather\u2019s capsule contributions are revealed. \n \n (Courtesy of Rogers/Grundhauser family) \n \n Grundhauser hopes to attend the opening ceremony of the time capsule with her daughter and father, but traveling to Boston from her home in Idaho may prove expensive and difficult. That won\u2019t stop her from enjoying all this moment in time has to offer for her family. \n \n \u201cI have great pride in my family,\u201d Grundhauser said. \u201cI stand on their shoulders and benefit from their hard work. I love all of the stories and Samuel\u2019s war time history. I think that Matt Damon needs to produce a movie about them.\u201d \n \n Note: Due to an editing error, an incomplete draft version of this story was published prematurely. ||||| Historians opened the 113-year-old time capsule inside the Old State House\u2019s golden lion statue Thursday, and were surprised by what they found: a mystery red book resting on top of the box\u2019s contents. \n \n Onlookers at a press-only unveiling gasped when the sealed box was pryed open. Library and Archives Manager at the Bostonian Society Elizabeth Roscio had every intention of assessing each content in the box, but decided not to remove the items once she noticed the box was so tightly packed. \n \n Items won't be removed.

An official with the Bostonian Society guesses that it might be a family history of a carpenter named Samuel Rogers, reports the Boston Globe. Rogers worked on the building and helped prepare the time capsule, notes a separate Globe story. And while he did reportedly pop a family history inside, there's no account of it being in a red book. Eventually, all the items will go on public display, and a new time capsule will go back inside the lion.

The Bostonian Society, which manages the historic building, had expected the box to contain letters, newspaper clippings, and other items from 1901, the year it was placed in the statue on the Old State House. The book had no visible markings, and nothing was taken out of the box because of the items' fragile condition. So, the contents of the book remain a mystery, for now. The inside of the box and its contents\u2014there was no mold or water damage\u2014thrilled society President Brian LeMay. LeMay said he was \"absolutely delighted\" with the conditions inside the box. The time capsule was sealed inside the lion's head since 1901 and then forgotten\u2014until recently. Rumors of its existence were confirmed last month when the statue was taken down from the Old State House for refurbishing. The delicate removal of the box took place at a sculpting studio in suburban Woburn. Robert Shure, owner of Skylight Studio, first removed a crown atop the copper and gold-leaf lion's head, cut cables holding the box in place inside the head, and removed the rectangular box, which weighed between five and 10 pounds and measured 8-by-12 inches in length and about 6 inches deep. The society, which manages the Old State House, first learned about the time capsule's existence years ago from the great-great-great-granddaughter of Samuel Rogers, a craftsman who had worked on building renovations.

We show three close-ups of those bands that tell the pre-history of the world in relief-sculpture form. They tell about dragons attacking Westeros. They tell about how the different houses on Westeros got together and defeated those dragons, and how those houses, represented by their respective animals, bowed in allegiance to the Baretheon stag. \n \n The title sequence was created by a company named Elastic. Here's a very interesting interview with the Creative Director of Elastic, ANGUS WALL, regarding the making of the opening sequence:The title sequence was inspired by the maps of Westeros that precede each novel in the series (and maps in fantasy novels in general). The creators decided to place the map on the inner surface of a sphere with an astrolabe-sun object at the center. The camera would then visit different parts of the map, whilst illustrations on the astrolabe covered some of the backstory to the series. The turning gears and cogs were meant to be reminiscent of Leonardo da Vinci's inventions.So this Astrolabe is basically a close-up of the sun in the middle and several bands surrounding it. If you look closely, there are relief details visible on these bands.In Wall's words:References:Interview with Angus Wall:Wiki: ||||| Left By Explorer's Armada, Shipwreck Yields 'Earliest Known' Marine Astrolabe \n \n By early 1503, most of Vasco da Gama's armada was returning home to Portugal after his second voyage to the Indian coast. The explorer, now roughly five years removed from discovering a direct sea route from Europe to India, left behind several ships to patrol (and pillage) the waters near modern-day Oman \u2014 but the winds eventually rose and smashed several of the remaining ships in raging storms. \n \n Now, more than 500 years later, the sunken ruins of one of those ships have yielded a surprising discovery: the world's \"earliest known\" marine astrolabe, according to researchers at the University of Warwick. They say the navigation tool, which sailors would use to reckon time by gauging the position of the sun and stars, dates to between 1495 and 1500. \n \n The instrument was one of more than 2,800 artifacts recovered from the Esmeralda, which has been under excavation since 2013. When Blue Water Recoveries first pulled it from the depths in 2014, David Mearns, the group's expedition leader, said he and his team suspected the 7-inch bronze disc could be an astrolabe. \n \n \"It was like nothing else we had seen and I immediately knew it was something very important because you could see it had these two emblems on it,\" he told the BBC. \"One I recognised immediately as a Portuguese coat of arms... and another which we later discovered was the personal emblem of Don Manuel I, the King of Portugal at the time.\" \n \n But the centuries-old instrument no longer betrayed any discernible navigational markings. Mearns and his colleagues needed some help to find them. \n \n Enter Mark Williams, a professor at Warwick who used \"pioneering analysis and 3D imaging\" to reveal hidden \"etches around the edge of the object, each separated by five degrees.\" These markings would help sailors of the day judge a celestial body's position with relation to the equator and their own position on the water \u2014 and, for researchers of today, they confirmed the identity of the mystery artifact. \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption University of Warwick University of Warwick \n \n \"It was fantastic to apply our 3D scanning technology to such an exciting project and help with the identification of such a rare and fascinating item,\" Williams said in a statement. \n \n \"Usually we are working on engineering-related challenges, so to be able to take our expertise and transfer that to something totally different and so historically significant was a really interesting opportunity.\" \n \n For Mearns, the confirmation marked an important milestone for a project that dates back nearly two decades.

They asked, \u201cWhich one of you is Malala?\u201d Some of the girls started to talk and then one of the men opened fire. All the girls started crying and shouting. Malala was hit in the head and fell to the floor unconscious. There was blood everywhere. I was in total shock. \n \n \u2018Then the man with the gun fired at me and another girl and ran away.

By yesterday, however, she was well enough to walk around her bed in the Combined Military Hospital. The third girl had comparatively minor injuries. \n \n Target: Malala had been told extremists wanted to harm her after she spoke out against them \n \n Explaining the build-up to the attack, Shazia said: \u2018Malala would talk to us about the dangers she was facing but refused to change the way she lived. She just said the extremists might do something to her because she had spoken out against them so much and they might want to harm her. \n \n \u2018She knew something might happen but she never let it affect her. She refused to be anything other than a normal schoolgirl.\u2019 \n \n Shazia said she was disgusted with the men who carried out the attack. \u2018We don\u2019t know who they were but I am sure they were the people Malala had been warned about,\u2019 she said. \n \n As she prepared to go home to her family, Shazia said her greatest wish was to return to school with Malala \u2013 even though the Taliban has threatened to return and kill Malala. \n \n \u2018With the grace of God, I am completely all right now. Malala will recover soon too, I hope. We will go back to school and study together again. \n \n \u2018I am praying for Malala and praying she can join her school friends again as soon as possible. The whole nation is praying for her and I am sure she will make a full recovery.\u2019 Shazia\u2019s father Muhammad Ramzan, 50, who runs a bakery in Mingora, said he was horrified by the attack. \n \n \u2018We have never been enemies with anyone,\u2019 he said. \u2018I don\u2019t know who did this.

(Associated Press) \n \n Tens of thousands rallied in Pakistan's largest city Sunday in the biggest show of support yet for a 14-year-old girl who was shot and seriously wounded by the Taliban for promoting girls' education and criticizing the militant group. \n \n The Oct. 9 attack on Malala Yousufzai as she was returning home from school in Pakistan's northwest horrified people inside and outside the country. At the same time, it gave hope to some that the government would respond by intensifying its fight against the Taliban and their allies. \n \n But protests against the shooting have been relatively small until now, usually attracting no more than a few hundred people. That response pales in comparison to the tens of thousands of people who held violent protests in Pakistan last month against a film produced in the United States that denigrated Islam's Prophet Muhammad. \n \n Demonstrations in support of Malala _ and against rampant militant violence in the country in general _ have also been fairly small compared with those focused on issues such as U.S. drone attacks and the NATO supply route to Afghanistan that runs through Pakistan. \n \n Right-wing Islamic parties and organizations in Pakistan that regularly pull thousands of supporters into the streets to protest against the U.S. have less of an incentive to speak out against the Taliban. The two share a desire to impose Islamic law in the country _ even if they may disagree over the Taliban's violent tactics. \n \n Pakistan's mainstream political parties are also often more willing to harangue the U.S. than direct their people power against Islamist militants shedding blood across the country _ partly out of fear and partly because they rely on Islamist parties for electoral support. \n \n One of the exceptions is the political party that organized Sunday's rally in the southern port city of Karachi, the Muttahida Quami Movement. The party's chief, Altaf Hussain, criticized both Islamic and other mainstream political parties for failing to organize rallies to protest the attack on Malala. \n \n He called the Taliban gunmen who shot the girl \"beasts\" and said it was an attack on \"the ideology of Pakistan.\" \n \n \"Malala Yousufzai is a beacon of knowledge. She is the daughter of the nation,\" Hussain told the audience by telephone from London, where he is in self-imposed exile because of legal cases pending against him in Pakistan. His party is strongest in Karachi. \n \n Many of the demonstrators carried the young girl's picture and banners praising her bravery and expressing solidarity. \n \n The leaders of Pakistan's main Islamic parties have criticized the shooting, but have also tried to redirect the conversation away from Taliban violence and toward civilian casualties from U.S. drone attacks. \n \n Cyril Almeida, a columnist for Pakistan's Dawn newspaper, said this type of \"obfuscation\" prevents Pakistanis from seeing \"there is a continuum from the religious right to violent Islamism.\" \n \n \"The religious right creates an enabling environment for violent Islamism to recruit and prosper. And violent Islamism makes state and society cower and in doing so enhances the space for the religious right,\" Almeida wrote in a column Sunday. \n \n Malala earned the enmity of the Pakistani Taliban for publicizing their behavior when they took over the northwestern Swat Valley, where she lived, and for speaking about the importance of education for girls. \n \n The group first started to exert its influence in Swat in 2007 and quickly extended its reach to much of the valley by the next year. They set about imposing their will on residents by forcing men to grow beards, preventing women from going to the market and blowing up many schools _ the majority for girls. \n \n Malala wrote about these practices in a journal for the BBC under a pseudonym when she was just 11. After the Taliban were pushed out of the Swat Valley in 2009 by the Pakistani military, she became even more outspoken in advocating for girls' education. She appeared frequently in the media and was given one of the country's highest honors for civilians for her bravery. \n \n The military carried out its offensive in Swat after a video surfaced of a militant flogging a woman who had allegedly committed adultery, which helped mobilize public support against the Taliban. \n \n Many hope the shooting of Malala will help push the military to undertake a long-awaited offensive in the Pakistani Taliban's last main sanctuary in the country in the North Waziristan tribal area. \n \n The Pakistani Taliban said they carried out the shooting because Malala was promoting \"Western thinking.\" Police have arrested at least three suspects in connection with the attack, but the two gunmen who carried out the shooting remain at large. \n \n The young girl was shot in the neck, and the bullet headed toward her spine. Two of her classmates were also wounded in the attack. \n \n Doctors at a military hospital operated on Malala to remove the bullet from her neck, and she was put on a ventilator. Her condition improved somewhat on Saturday when she was able to move her legs and hands after her sedatives were reduced. \n \n On Sunday, she was successfully taken off the ventilator for a short period and later reconnected to avoid fatigue, the military said. Doctors are satisfied she is making slow and steady progress and will decide whether to send her abroad for treatment. They have not said whether she suffered any brain damage or other type of permanent damage. \n \n The United Arab Emirates plans to send a specialized aircraft to serve as an ambulance for the girl in case doctors decide to send her abroad, the Pakistani ambassador to the country, Jamil Ahmed Khan, said Sunday. \n \n Visas are being finalized for the air ambulance crew and six doctors who will accompany the flight, Khan told Pakistan's Geo TV. Arrangements have been made to treat the girl at three hospitals in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, he said. \n \n The UAE Embassy in Islamabad could not immediately be reached for comment. \n \n No decision has yet been taken to send the girl abroad, but the air ambulance is part of the contingency plan, the Pakistani military said. \n \n Afghan President Hamid Karzai has written letters to top political and religious leaders in Pakistan denouncing the attack on Yousufzai and asking them to help battle extremism in both countries, the president's office said in a statement issued late Saturday. Karzai wrote that he views the shooting as an attack on Afghanistan's girls as well. \n \n ____ \n \n Abbot reported from Islamabad. Associated Press writers Asif Shahzad, Zarar Khan and Munir Ahmed in Islamabad and Deb Riechmann in Kabul, Afghanistan, contributed to this report. ||||| Malala Yousafzai did not trade in her modest head scarf for a pair of skinny jeans. She wanted to go to school. \n \n \n \n For that, the Taliban tried to kill her. When her attackers learned that the freckled 14-year-old Pakistani might survive, they promised to finish the job. Malala, they explained, had been \"promoting Western culture.\" \n \n \n \n The Taliban has committed all manner of atrocities over the years, many of them aimed at women. This time, the militants created an icon for a global movement \u2014 for the notion that the most efficient way to propel developing countries is to educate their girls. The idea has been flourishing in some of the world's most destitute and volatile places. Today, courtesy of the Pakistani Taliban, it has a face. \n \n PHOTOS: Malala Yousafzai \n \n \"People think 'Western values' is wearing jeans and sipping pop. Malala was doing none of that,\" said Murtaza Haider, a Pakistan native and the associate dean of research and graduate programs at the Ted Rogers School of Management at Toronto's Ryerson University. \"All she said was: 'Would you be kind enough to reopen my school?' This is what the Taliban thinks is a 'Western value.' This is not a Western value. This is a universal value.\" \n \n \n \n Pakistan's Swat Valley, where Malala grew up, is rich in agriculture and minerals, and ringed like a halo by mountains with perennial snow. There are falcons and peridot-colored lakes, and, for a time, there was the country's only ski resort. Queen Elizabeth II visited in the 1960s. \n \n \n \n Then, in 2003, came an arm of the Taliban, which imposed strict religious law, as it had in neighboring Afghanistan. Music was banned. Men would wear beards. And girls would no longer go to school. \n \n \n \n This last bit did not sit well with Malala. When she was all of 11 years old, she started a diary about life under the Taliban's thumb. \n \n \n \n Entries in that diary were published by the BBC. Malala became something of a celebrity, featured in documentaries, insisting to visiting journalists that she still had rights \u2014 \"to play,\" she said, \"to sing.\" Most of all: \"I have the right of education.\" She knew she was risking her life, telling a reporter at one point that if the Taliban tried to kill her, \"I'll first say to them: 'What you're doing is wrong.'\" \n \n \n \n The communications revolution that is the hallmark of Malala's generation has not yet lived up to its promise of transforming the world economy. But it has ushered in an age of instantaneous, worldwide conversation. When replacement referees in the NFL bungle crucial calls, the debate is won at the moment it begins, and the regular refs are promptly brought back in. When politicians dismiss half the country as \"victims\" or deliver a lackluster debate performance, the public verdict is delivered swiftly. \n \n \n \n Malala lived in one of the few places where that conversation still doesn't resonate. But she had unwittingly tapped into that revolution \u2014 and was back in school when she was shot and critically wounded last week. She didn't know it, but she had a voice powerful enough to contest the Taliban. \n \n \n \n Years before she was born, anecdotal evidence collected by development programs suggested the importance of educating girls. Knowledge in girls' heads often meant money in their pockets. And women tended to invest not in themselves, but in their communities \u2014 in healthcare, for instance, or nutrition. \n \n \n \n Researchers developed metrics to measure the effect. Educated women were more skilled and could make more money, but they also married later and raised healthier children. They had lower rates of disease. Extrapolate from there and the results ballooned from primary education to more efficient local government, even democratic reform. \n \n \n \n That movement has caught fire. \n \n \n \n In 2009, the book \"Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide\" made the compelling argument that this is the defining social issue of the 21st century, as rejecting slavery defined the 19th and fighting totalitarianism defined the 20th. \n \n \n \n The book spawned a television series that aired this fall. A film, \"Girl Rising,\" documenting the struggles of girls seeking an education, is to arrive in theaters next spring and air on CNN. The movie is the centerpiece of 10x10, a global action campaign for girls education. \n \n \n \n Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has steered the weight of the U.S. government toward the issue, and more foreign aid has been earmarked for girls education. Corporate partners have signed on to the cause. \n \n \n \n \"It's just that moment, the moment when you put your finger on the pulse of the problem,\" said Maro Chermayeff, executive producer of \"Half the Sky's\" outreach effort. \"People are starting to understand that incredible untapped potential: the army of change that girls can be.\" \n \n \n \n Richard Robbins, director of \"Girl Rising,\" now has a photo of Malala on his desk in Los Angeles. Traveling to Haiti, Sierra Leone and elsewhere for the film, Robbins said he found that girls encountered a host of obstacles to education: geographic isolation, for instance, or the sense that school is not a good investment because there's no job at the other end. \n \n \n \n \"But there are very few people in the world now who are actually against education,\" Robbins said. \"This idea that it's dangerous for a girl to have knowledge \u2014 this is the last gasp of that idea, which was pretty prevalent 200 years ago, everywhere in the world.\" \n \n \n \n There is always room for cynicism in Malala's corner of the world. Pakistan has blown numerous opportunities to combat extremism. With the planned withdrawal of Western troops from Afghanistan, some see an opening for more Taliban influence in the region, not less. As one Pakistani journalist tweeted: \"For everyone who seems to think Malala's assassination attempt is some 'moment' \u2014 Pakistan had lots of them and guess what happened? Nothing.\" \n \n \n \n But even some hardened observers see suggestions of lasting effects. Women have protested with signs assailing the Taliban by name \u2014 unthinkable in some pockets of Pakistan. Few thought that a promised reward for information leading to Malala's assailants would do any good. On Friday, police announced that several men had been detained. \n \n \n \n \"There's definitely international condemnation, but in equal amount there's condemnation in Pakistan,\" said Shamila Chaudhary, a former director for Pakistan and Afghanistan at the White House National Security Council, now a senior South Asia fellow at the New America Foundation. \n \n PHOTOS: Malala Yousafzai \n \n Some believe the attempt to kill Malala could propel the girls education movement into the Swat Valley \u2014 and then, perhaps, pose an existential threat to the Taliban. \n \n \n \n Shabana Basij-Rasikh attended college in the U.S. and has returned home to Afghanistan to open one of that nation's first boarding schools for girls. Students who live in regions under Taliban control attend in secret, she said. Some hide their school books in grocery bags, just as she did when she grew up under Taliban rule. \n \n \n \n \"What Malala has achieved, the military could not,\" Basij-Rasikh said. \n \n \n \n scott.gold@latimes.com",

Swenson has submitted a formal request to the Army and officials are working with him to allow his return. \n \n Swenson was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Barack Obama in the White House Tuesday afternoon for risking his life to recover bodies and save fellow troops during a lengthy battle against the Taliban in Afghanistan near the Pakistan border in 2009. \n \n The U.S. officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the request until a decision was made. \n \n Swenson, 34, left the military in February 2011 as a captain, but he could rise to the rank of major once he rejoins. In order to successfully re-enlist, Swenson will have to pass a physical, a drug test and other routine reviews. But officials Tuesday were optimistic it would all fall into place. \n \n In the aftermath of 9/11, when the Army was growing in size to meet the combat requirements of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, it was not unusual for former soldiers to rejoin the service and go back on active duty. It is rare, if not unprecedented, for an officer holding the Medal of Honor, to do so. Officials were unsure if that had ever happened before. \n \n Swenson also has a Purple Heart and Bronze Star Medal and lives in Seattle. ||||| ADVERTISEMENT \n \n After nearly being overlooked, and according to some accounts intentionally forgotten, Army Capt. William Swenson received the Medal of Honor at an emotional White House ceremony Tuesday for his heroic actions during the 2009 Battle of Ganjgal in eastern Afghanistan. \n \n Ganjgal was one of the bloodiest battles of the 12-year war. Ambushed by the Taliban, coalition forces were pinned down for nine hours. The fight ended with five U.S. deaths, 10 Afghan army deaths and over two-dozen coalition wounded. \n \n Late Tuesday, Fox News confirmed reports that Swenson, who since leaving the Army in 2011 has spent much of his time in the wilderness of Washington state, has asked the Army to return him to active duty -- a rare request for a Medal of Honor recipient. An Army spokesman said, \"We are reviewing his request and processing it within established policy.\" \n \n The ceremony Tuesday marked only the second time in half a century that the nation's highest award for valor has been given to two survivors of the same battle. In 2011, Marine Sgt. Dakota Meyer, who fought alongside Swenson, received the same medal for his actions at Ganjgal. \n \n But Swenson's battle didn't end in Ganjgal. After the firefight, he bitterly complained about incompetence in the ranks, suggesting to Army investigators and reporters that his commanders decided the political risk of civilian casualties outweighed the need to protect the lives of Americans. \n \n Swenson said his multiple requests for air support were denied as he repeatedly put his life at risk to save his fallen and wounded comrades. \n \n A year-and-a-half after the battle, an Army investigation resulted in career-ending reprimands for two of the officers responsible for fielding Swenson's calls for help. \n \n Swenson told Fox News on Tuesday that while \"you can have misunderstandings\" and disagreements with individuals, \"the institution cannot let you down.\" \n \n \"The Army did not let me down,\" he said. \n \n Describing the ceremony on Tuesday, he said: \"I looked into a room that was there to support me, but I was there to support them, and I will continue to be there to support them. My colleagues, families of the fallen -- it was a powerful moment.\" \n \n President Obama described Swenson's actions at the ceremony Tuesday. \"Will and the soldiers in the center of the column are pinned down. Rocket propelled grenades, mortar, machine gun fire -- all of this is pouring in from three sides. As he returns fire, Will calls for air support, but his initial requests are denied.\" \n \n Obama continued: \"And then Will learns that his non-commissioned officer, Sergeant 1st Class Kenneth Westbrook, has been shot in the neck. So Will breaks across 50 meters of open space, bullets biting all around. Lying on his back, he presses a bandage to Kenneth's wounds with one hand, and calls for a medevac with the other, trying to keep his buddy calm.\" \n \n Dramatic helmet-cam video released by the Army shows Swenson lift his badly wounded comrade into a medevac chopper, stopping to kiss him on the forehead before returning to the fight. Westbrook's wife would later thank Swenson for helping keep him alive long enough so that she could say her final goodbyes. \n \n Initially, the Army began to process Swenson for the Medal of Honor, compiling a comprehensive account of his actions that day. But as Meyer received his award in 2011, suspicion arose about why Swenson's name had not come up at the White House. The Army later claimed it \"lost\" the phonebook-sized Medal of Honor nomination packet on Swenson. The veracity of that claim is now the subject of an ongoing Army inspector general's investigation. \n \n Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., who has been a strong advocate for Swenson, says the packet wasn't lost, but rather it was purposefully destroyed. \n \n \"His record got deleted,\" Hunter, an Iraq war veteran, told Fox News in an interview Tuesday. \"I mean, somebody went in and took his Medal of Honor nomination and deleted it from the awards database. That means that somebody in the Army did not want him to get the Medal of Honor.\" \n \n Hunter claims it was an act of retribution against Swenson for speaking out about his commanders. Hunter and his staff were instrumental in pressuring the Army to reinstate Swenson's application for the Medal of Honor. ||||| Story highlights William Swenson is the sixth living recipient from the Afghan and Iraq wars \n \n Swenson was honored for his action on September 8, 2009, in the Ganjgal Valley \n \n He braved enemy fire to retrieve the bodies of dead soldiers, Obama says \n \n He criticized his commanders for failing to support soldiers during the battle \n \n A shaky video captured only a few moments of William D. Swenson's actions during a brutal, hours-long battle in Afghanistan: Kissing a badly wounded comrade on the forehead as he helped load the soldier into a helicopter. \n \n \"This may be the first time we bear witness to a small portion of the action\" of a Medal of Honor recipient, President Barack Obama said Tuesday as he awarded the now-retired Army captain the nation's highest military honor for his actions in the Ganjgal Valley in 2009. \n \n Swenson, 34, of Seattle, is the sixth living recipient from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan to earn the honor, and this is only the second time in a half-century that two men from the same battle have been awarded the medal. \n \n Swenson, who retired from the Army in 2011, is being awarded the medal for his actions on September 8, 2009, in the Battle of the Ganjgal Valley in Afghanistan's Kunar province. The battle claimed the lives of four American soldiers, 10 Afghan soldiers and an Afghan interpreter. \n \n A fifth soldier, Sgt. First Class Kenneth Westbrook -- the man Swenson helped load onto the helicopter -- later died from his wounds. \n \n JUST WATCHED Meet William Swenson Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Meet William Swenson 02:20 \n \n Swenson was working with Afghan security forces in the volatile Kunar province near Pakistan's border when he and his troops came under fire. \n \n Obama recounted to an audience of fellow soldiers and families of the fallen how Swenson braved enemy fire again and again to recover the bodies of the dead Americans and Afghans. \n \n \"In moments like this, Americans like Will remind us of what our country can be at its best, a nation of citizens who look out for one another, who meet our obligations to one another not just when it's easy, but also when it's hard,\" Obama said. \"Maybe, especially when it's hard.\" \n \n Part of Swenson's rescue efforts were recorded by a rescue pilot's helmet camera. In the heat of battle, with bullets flying and dust blocking any clear vision of the surrounding situation, Swenson is seen helping Westbrook, who had been shot in the throat, back to a helicopter. \n \n After placing him in the helicopter, Swenson bent down to kiss his forehead before running back to the battle to retrieve other fallen Americans and Afghan fighters. \n \n \"I was just trying to keep his spirits up. I wanted him to know it was going to be OK. And I wanted him to know that he had done his job, but it was time for him to go,\" Swenson told CNN recently. \n \n The road to this honor has not been easy for Swenson, whose nomination was \"lost\" for a time, prompting questions from lawmakers and an eventual internal Pentagon investigation. \n \n Swenson spoke out after the 2009 battle, criticizing his leadership for failing to provide him with adequate air support after multiple radio requests. The Army later backed up his claims, reprimanding two commanding officers. \n \n \"What happened that day was a result of clouded judgment,\" Swenson told CNN's Barbara Starr in a recent interview. \"It was a result of clouded judgment on behalf of people who did later receive letters of reprimand.\" \n \n The nomination statement, once found, was nothing short of glowing for Swenson, saying the soldier \"braved intense enemy fire, and willfully put his life in danger against the enemy's main effort, multiple times in service of his fallen and wounded comrades, his unit, his country, and his endangered Afghan partners.\" \n \n Army officials confirmed to CNN that Swenson has filed paperwork to return to Army active duty. \n \n Dakota Meyer, a Marine, was honored for his actions in the same battle in 2011.",

Will Swenson received the nation's highest military honor today for rescuing fellow soldiers under heavy fire in Afghanistan a few years ago, reports CNN. And in a rare move, the 34-year-old has formally asked the Army to return him to active duty, reports AP. Generally speaking, Medal of Honor recipients are out of action, but it looks like Swenson will be back in uniform fairly soon. Swenson left the military in 2011, two years after the actions during a firefight in Afghanistan's Ganjgal valley that earned him his medal. \"In moments like this, Americans like Will remind us of what our country can be at its best,\" said President Obama at today's ceremony, as quoted by Fox News.",

Swenson left the military in 2011 and has spent much of his time in the wilderness of Washington state.

    "document": "Rookie is an online magazine and book series for teenagers. Each month, a different editorial theme drives the writing, photography, and artwork that we publish. Learn more about us here , and find out how to submit your work here ! \n \n \u201cWhoa, impressive taste for a teen-girl mag!\u201d \n \n This comment, in one form or another, often gets directed at us on Twitter, especially on Friday nights, right after we post our weekly playlists. It\u2019s also something I hear a lot in real life when I tell people\u2014especially grown men\u2014who I write for. \u201cWow!\u201d they\u2019ll say. \u201cGood work, ladies!\u201d Their surprise might be based on our staff\u2019s working knowledge of punk rock history (yes, we know who the Wipers are) or on the fact that Rookie\u2019s articles are actually thoughtful and well written, but it\u2019s always condescending and insulting, and never itself much of a surprise. \n \n I know I\u2019m coming dangerously close to generalizing about ALL men in the exact same way I\u2019m complaining that SOME men generalize about young women. There are, of course, many male critics who celebrate teen-girl fandom and our voices as cultural consumers and analysts and don\u2019t roll their eyes when we gush about 1D or whatever. Thank you for that, dudes. But because men have more power across the board than women in our culture, they get the message, from birth, that their opinions about things are the Most Important Opinions. Whether they choose to believe this is up to them, but rejecting it is a lot harder than sitting back and enjoying it. \n \n So I can hardly blame the many, many adult males who seem to have this cute assumption that all girls are dying for their approval of our cultural tastes, though we never actually asked for it. And I guess it\u2019s kind of understandable that they might assume we have shitty taste\u2014but I still don\u2019t totally understand their need to vocally criticize us for liking the things we like. When Tavi posted a link to an excerpt of her Taylor Swift piece for The Believer, a highly detailed and laborious work of pure love for Swift\u2019s music, a male cartoonist called her out for liking what sounded to him like \u201cthe soundtrack to getting a froyo and then stopping at Target for a new pair of Crocs.\u201d Not that she asked him! \n \n When I wrote a long piece for Buzzfeed about discovering Animal Collective and falling in love with them as a 12-year-old girl, dudes in the comments section made fun of my musical taste! Apparently my enthusiasm and knowledge meant nothing, because this band\u2019s music wasn\u2019t on the sacred list of Music Men Approve Of. And that\u2019s just one example in a long history of criticisms lobbed against me and my apparent TEEN TASTES! Once, I was talking to an older male friend about the brilliance of Mean Girls, and he kept dismissing it as an airheaded comedy \u201cfor teens.\u201d Obviously, he hadn\u2019t seen it, because I think we all know that Mean Girls is a classic for people of any age. It wasn\u2019t until I told him that the movie was written by Tina Fey that he seemed willing to reconsider his first reaction. Because 30 Rock is cool, but young women are NOT. \n \n When you applaud or critique a young girl\u2019s taste based on how well or badly it aligns with yours, you are suggesting that your taste = THE RIGHT TASTE, because you are the one IN THE KNOW. I sometimes rate movies on the website Mubi, and I can\u2019t count the number of times an older male cinephile has urged me to rewatch a film I\u2019ve given a low score to, because obviously I \u201cdidn\u2019t understand it\u201d the first time around. \u201cHow do you even know about this?\u201d they sometimes ask. \u201cYou weren\u2019t even born when this movie came out.\u201d Dude: I have the internet. \n \n This kind of cultural superiority complex extends to the makers of culture as well. For evidence, look at almost any piece written by a grown man about a young female artist. Here\u2019s one: When Jody Rosen wrote about T. Swift for New York magazine, rather than ask this funny, smart, world-famous young pop star anything interesting about her work or her views on the world, he pitted her G-rated pop against Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s and Rihanna\u2019s more risqu\u00e9 work and let us know that Swift has never \u201cwrithed across a stage wearing a negligee, or less.\u201d Rosen found Swift \u201cwitty,\u201d \u201cdespite her public persona.\u201d Because, what, cute girls can\u2019t be funny? He marveled at the mostly female crowd at her concert for a full paragraph, but was careful to point out that there were \u201ccreepy dudes from Oklahoma\u201d among the screaming young females, to illustrate\u2026what? That Swift is so versatile that she appeals to both (a) females and (b) male creeps? The whole piece came across as the work of someone deeply out of their element. I mean, he described the male gaze as an \u201cold feminist bugbear.\u201d Why is this the person who was assigned to the Taylor Swift story? \n \n Following the U.S. premiere of Chris Lilley\u2019s television show Ja\u2019mie: Private School Girl, which has Lilley playing a highly exaggerated mean-girl archetype, several think pieces popped up to criticize not the show itself (even though there was plenty to legitimately criticize, as a few smart writers did), but rather\u2026the sorry state of REAL YOUNG WOMEN in the world. In one such article on The Atlantic\u2019s website, Jake Flanagin took a look at a work of over-the-top campy fiction and posed, in all apparent sincerity, this question (about real people!): \u201cWhy are young women turning into monsters?\u201d I repeat: monsters. Ooh, scary! I\u2019m sure we\u2019re a big threat to straight white men who write for magazines like The Atlantic, what with all our dangerous selfies and Snapchats and sexts. Flanagin went on to wonder whether the average viewer was smart enough to tell that the show is satire: \u201cPresumably, Lilley poses this array of amusing insecurities and prejudices as a critical device, not face-value comedy,\u201d he sniffed. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult to say whether the audience can discern the difference.\u201d \n \n As a member of that audience and a teenage girl (aka future monster), I\u2019d like to ease his fears, at least on that last point: Teenage girls know that Ja\u2019mie: Private School Girl is satire; it\u2019s by Chris Lilley, for god\u2019s sake. Have you ever met a teenage girl, Jake? We don\u2019t act like Ja\u2019mie. Just like how you, a guy in his 20s, don\u2019t act like Van Wilder. Or so I assume (insert a thousand winks here). \n \n I know I have a vested interest in this whole thing because I\u2019m an aspiring cultural critic and a current young woman, but I think I speak for all girls and women between the ages of 13 and 19 when I say that grown-up male journalists are probably not the best choice to assign stories about teen-girl culture to (keeping in mind those aforementioned exceptions). What they come up with, too much of the time, is a lot of off-base and frankly clueless speculation about what girls think, what we do, what we want, and what we need. \n \n It\u2019s not these dudes\u2019 fault that they believe they know everything. They were raised that way. But they really don\u2019t know much about us at all. Here\u2019s a tip for them: Next time you\u2019re musing as to what girls are all about, try to shut up and listen. \u2666 ||||| High schooler and creator of online magazine Rookie, Tavi Gevinson is busy fashioning a DIY media empire that speaks to teens. \n \n Column One Tavi Gevinson rockets from Rookie to teen pop-culture heights High schooler and creator of online magazine Rookie, Tavi Gevinson is busy fashioning a DIY media empire that speaks to teens. \n \n In her Beatlemania schoolgirl outfit \u2014 gray miniskirt, knee-highs and electric-blue suede shoes \u2014 Tavi Gevinson looks like any other fashion-obsessed teen as she wanders the crowded aisles of Los Angeles' American Rag Cie. \n \n \"I can't afford, like, anything here on my allowance,\" the 17-year-old says, scanning the store's horizon for any gems she might have missed. \n \n She pulls out her iPhone and responds to a text. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \"My dad, he'll be here in about half an hour to pick me up,\" she says, heading toward a carousel rack of vintage-image postcards \u2014 \"the one thing I actually can afford!\" \n \n Gevinson is decisive as she plucks out certain moody postcards and quickly discards others. When the wobbly rack catches on the carpet and fails to turn, the petite Gevinson lifts the metal display and firmly plants it a few inches away, where it swirls freely. \n \n \"There\" she says sweetly. \"I'll take these four.\" After paying, Gevinson tucks the cards away in her floral backpack. \"Now, what were we talking about again?\" \n \n One can forgive the high school senior for being a bit distracted. After flying in from Chicago, she was up late the night before finishing an essay. But the assignment wasn't for school. It was the editor's letter for Rookie, the online pop-culture magazine she started when she was 15; now she oversees a staff of about 80. There was also a photo shoot this morning, followed by a meeting with her agent and then another whirlwind shopping trip in Hollywood. \n \n She will appear at Skylight Books later to sign copies of \"Rookie Yearbook Two,\" an annual print anthology of Rookie's best online writing paired with original content from the likes of Lena Dunham, Mindy Kaling, Judy Blume and singer-songwriter Grimes. The store expects an adoring mob of teenage fans for Gevinson, called \"the future of journalism\" by no less than Lady Gaga. \n \n Part Tina Brown, part Dorothy Parker, the quick-witted Gevinson has the ear \u2014 and Tumblr accounts \u2014 of a new generation of young women. Not to mention the eye of the media, the fashion world and, lately, Hollywood filmmakers. \n \n She was just 11 when she started the Style Rookie fashion blog out of her Oak Park, Ill., bedroom. Soon she was sitting on the front lines of New York's Fashion Week. Fast-forward to 2013: appearances on \"Late Night With Jimmy Fallon\" and \"The Colbert Report,\" international speaking engagements and a role in the film \"Enough Said\" opposite Julia Louis-Dreyfus. \n \n With more than 4 million page views a month, Rookie is emerging as a DIY multiplatform media empire of sorts for Girl America. \n \n The goal has become to make people feel included, that they're cool enough or smart enough.\u201d \u2014 Tavi Gevinson Share this quote \n \n \"I'd felt like there wasn't a publication for teenagers that was respected. Or that I, myself, or my friends could really relate to,\" Gevinson says, settling into a booth at the cafe next door to American Rag, her creamy skin, crimson lipstick and blond bob giving her something of a \"Ghost World\"-era Scarlett Johansson quality. She slurps her lemonade. \n \n \"One thing I'm very proud of is that Rookie has a lot of legitimacy in publishing and music journalism and fashion. As it's grown, the goal has become more to make people feel included, that they're cool enough or smart enough.\" \n \n Rookie beginnings \n \n The original Style Rookie blog impressed journalist Anaheed Alani so much she offered unsolicited help. \n \n \"She emailed me and said: 'I work at the New York Times, and I will quit my job to help you,'\" Gevinson says. \"It was clear we were on the same wavelength. She's now second in command and my partner in a lot of ways.\" \n \n Alani, 43, now Rookie's editorial director, has no issues working for a teenage boss. \n \n \"Tavi's one of the best bosses I've had,\" Alani says. \"My rule for bosses and therapists is they have to be smarter than I am \u2014 and Tavi completely fits that bill.\" \n \n An instant success when it launched in late 2011, Rookie now boasts jewelry and makeup ads and hosts in-person Rookie events in cities across the country, such as an Urban Outfitters-sponsored road trip last year that included crown-making workshops \u2014 Gevinson feels her now-signature floral crowns show \"a pride in one's girliness.\" \n \n In addition to material from the site, the Rookie yearbooks feature exclusive interviews with major pop cultural figures such as Morrissey, Chris Ware and Emma Watson; they're juxtaposed against personal essays by teens on universal issues such as sex, racism, friendship and feminism. \n \n Boiled down, Gevinson's message might be \"embrace yourself\" \u2014 and it seems to be resonating. \n \n \"She's really, really popular with L.A. girls,\" says 16-year-old Xulani Akel, a sophomore at Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies. \"It's so amazing that she's so young and so successful. I'm worried about getting, like, one B, and she has this whole company thing that she's doing and that she really enjoys. That sets the bar really high!\" \n \n Fans at a bookstore \n \n Skylight Books is filling up. The teen girls filter in, some wearing brightly colored floral headbands, others in swingy skirts and glittering prom crowns. Most carry a certain dog-eared book tucked under their arms as they swing between intensely focused and bubbling over with excitement. \n \n Like a religious pilgrimage, many come bearing gifts cradled in their arms for Gevinson, who at the moment sits in the store's office loft, overlooking the main floor. Chitchatting with the two Rookie contributors who will be reading with her tonight, Gevinson looks very much her age. \n \n \"This'll be fun. Who wants to go first?\" she asks them, as if the event were an impromptu school talent show. \n \n Moments later, however, when Gevinson takes the podium before a now settled-in crowd of about 150 rapt girls, she is preternaturally poised as she faces the crowd. She holds her iPhone out in front of her with two hands, as if it were stiff essay paper, and reads off the screen in an adult, measured tone. \n \n How is she able to ingest so much pop culture daily, interview her heroes, blog prolifically, write essays for Rookie and oversee her staff \u2014 all while attending high school? It's simple time management, she says earlier in the day, at the cafe on La Brea Avenue. \n \n Gevinson spends nearly every sliver of downtime listening to podcasts or music \u2014 most recently Lorde, Taylor Swift and Kanye West \u2014 while walking to school, for example, or watching old episodes of \"Freaks and Geeks\" and \"My So-Called Life\" at night. Study hall, she says, is a perfect time to read other books she finds more relevant in the long run, like \"Girl Power\" by Marisa Meltzer. \n \n Such efficiency, however, is not without sacrifice. \n \n \"There are compromises,\" Gevinson says. \"Like there have been times when my grades have suffered or I can't visit my boyfriend when I'd like to because I have a number of interviews that day. But it's worth it.\" \n \n Still, Gevinson's parents have made sure to keep her life \"full of normal teenage stuff,\" says her father, Steve. She attends the local public high school and recently got an allowance increase. She doesn't yet earn a salary from Rookie \u2014 though that may change soon, he says, as the site becomes more profitable \u2014 and speaking engagement fees go into her savings. The total sum of her liquid assets from day to day is her allowance: $25 a week. \n \n She left the room and I said, 'I want her.'\u201d \u2014 \"Enough Said\" director Nicole Holofcener Share this quote \n \n \"It's a nice little fiction that we're living out because she has this bank account,\" he says. \"But she likes living that way. We like her living that way.\" \n \n Like many proud \"pop culture nerds,\" Gevinson has a not-so-subtle obsessive streak. She might get up at 3 a.m. to rearrange all her books, she says, and not only journals her life's every happening, from monumental to mundane, but also \"curates\" her peripheral pop culture experiences to match her moods. \n \n \"Sophomore year I had my heart broken by a boy. I loved the feeling of heartbreak with dressing in nightgowns from the '70s, lighting candles and listening to Heart and Carole King,\" she says. \"I documented it all. It's like making a bunch of little movies. It makes me feel like I'm in control and everything has a place in the world.\" \n \n These days, Gevinson's mood is often a mix of excitement and trepidation. She's awaiting graduation in May and has applied to New York University, Barnard, Brown and Wesleyan \u2014 though she'd like to take a year off first to live in New York and focus on Rookie as well as other creative ventures, such as acting. \n \n \"Enough Said\" director Nicole Holofcener has no trouble envisioning Gevinson as a movie star. \n \n \"Tavi walked in [to auditions], this little lovely thing, an angel with red lips and pink cheeks,\" Holofcener says. \"She was maybe more nervous than someone who's been in a million films, but that nervousness was so natural and vulnerable and sweet. She left the room and I said, 'I want her.'\" \n \n How does all this high-profile success translate in the halls, on an everyday basis, at school in suburban Illinois? \n \n Stirring the straw in her lemonade, Gevinson plays down her success, insisting that most kids at her school are either unaware of her growing fame or they don't particularly care. \n \n Suddenly, three eager heads poke out of a nearby booth, their hands waving furiously at Gevinson. \"Hi, Tavi!\" they squeal in unison. \"We love you.\" \n \n Gevinson shrugs and breaks into a little-girl smile herself, giggling at the absurdity. \"Oh, I guess they recognize me,\" she says. \n \n On her way out of the cafe, Gevinson pauses at the door. \n \n \"I just hate 'voice of a generation' stuff,\" she says, balking at the suggestion. \"You put someone on a pedestal and of course they can't represent all of feminism or all people their age or whatever.\" \n \n And with that, Gevinson scurries out to the parking lot to meet her dad, her books and notes for the evening's reading bundled in her arms. \n \n Contact the reporter \n \n Follow Deborah Vankin(@debvankin) on Twitter \n \n Follow @latgreatreads on Twitter ||||| Rookie is an online magazine and book series for teenagers.

Why I, 11 years old in a baggy T-shirt and squeezed into my cinema seat, wanted to hide, while everyone around me guffawed at the onscreen hijinks. But now I know: That was the first time I looked at a movie screen and saw an image that looked like me. And that image fucking sucked. \n \n For those of you who haven\u2019t seen it, let me save you the pain: Shallow Hal is about a guy called Hal who falls in love with Rosemary, a fat woman played by Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suit. The \u201cjoke\u201d is that Hal has been hypnotized to see Rosemary as thin, but everyone else knows her true size. She breaks every chair she sits on and her cannonballs empty a swimming pool (LOLOLOL fat people, amirite? Why do they even bother leaving the house!), but he thinks she\u2019s hot. When Hal finally sees her as she really is, he becomes a better man and learns not to judge people on appearances\u2014because he fell in love with a fat girl he thought was thin and therefore learned that fat people actually have brains and hearts and feelings and personalities! What a hero! \n \n The reactions Gwyneth\u2019s character got from people (aside from Hal) were very familiar to me. I\u2019ve gotten the same reactions all my life: at the pool or at the food court or in the school gym or on a plane when I, too, had the gall to be FIP (fat in public). This movie, though not deep or heartfelt, also touches on something that is very real for a lot of fat girls: the idea that a thin, pretty version of yourself exists underneath your fat, and if you only bothered to excavate her, you might be happy/loved/successful. I call this the \u201cbut you\u2019ve got such a pretty face\u201d syndrome, based on comments I\u2019ve heard my entire life\u2014from relatives, from movies, from TV\u2014that say in no uncertain terms, \u201cYou\u2019re not good enough now, but with a little work, you could be.\u201d \n \n We (people, women, Rookie) talk a lot about media representations of women and how they affect the lives of real, nonfamous women and girls. We celebrate Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s power and her unapologetic, take-no-prisoners attitude (in her life and her art) and the messages these things send to young girls. We talk about the pressure that unrealistic beauty ideals in magazines and other mass media puts on girls, and how that affects their self-esteem. But it\u2019s harder to talk about the way fat women are represented on TV and in film, and how these representations affect fat women (like me) IRL, because there are so few examples of our being seen as anything besides walking, talking truffle-shuffle jokes. It\u2019s hard to work out how to do something properly when it\u2019s so rarely been done at all. And it\u2019s really, really hard to be OK with your body when you\u2019re constantly being reminded that it\u2019s something for other people to laugh at. \n \n The \u201cpretty face\u201d message was stunningly, heartbreakingly brought to the screen in episode two of the British TV series My Mad Fat Diary, one of very few shows on the air ever that have featured an authentic and multidimensional fat female character. In this episode, that character, Rae Earl, a 16-year-old girl, has just been released from a psychiatric hospital following a suicide attempt. We see her get into an argument with her best friend Chloe (who is thin, conventionally beautiful, and outgoing), then we see her weigh herself and hear bits from her diary in voiceover: \u201cI am a body dysmorphic, without the dysmorphic. I am bulimic without the sick. I am fat.\u201d What follows is a dream sequence in which Rae lowers a zipper that runs down her back and sheds her \u201cfat self,\u201d revealing a curvy lingerie model underneath. She drags her flabby shell down the stairs, takes it into the backyard, and sets it on fire. \n \n I followed Rae\u2019s story obsessively throughout the show\u2019s first season, because I saw so many memories in it of my own teenage years. When Rae lies down on the grass near the boy she likes, tugs at her T-shirt, and positions her hands across her stomach in a subtle attempt to hide its size, I replay in my mind scenes of myself doing those exact same things. When Rae struggles to find a swimsuit to wear to a pool party, I\u2019m transported back to tear-filled changing rooms, where I relive my terror at the thought of anyone from school seeing me without my clothes on. \n \n But Rae is more than her insecurities and issues. She loves music and tells jokes. She\u2019s a supportive friend and occasionally acts out as a bratty teenager. To me, Rae is a wonderful fat female character because her weight is important to her back story, but it\u2019s never more important than her obsessive love of Madchester bands or her kind, sensitive personality. She makes us laugh by telling jokes, not by eating, struggling to walk, falling over, breaking chairs, or doing other Fat Person Things. She is Rae first, fat later. \n \n In this, Rae is kind of the inverse of the roles Rebel Wilson has been playing lately. After appearing briefly (but memorably) in Bridesmaids (more on that movie later), Wilson went on to star in the a cappella comedy Pitch Perfect, in the dark comedy Bachelorette, and on her own TV series, Super Fun Night, which is on the air now. In those three roles, Wilson\u2019s weight informs her character. Pitch Perfect\u2019s Fat Amy hates exercise and, in the movie\u2019s uplifting climax, tells the thin girls on her singing team that she loves them because they have \u201cfat hearts.\u201d Becky, Wilson\u2019s character in Bachelorette, is a mope whose friends tread all over her and tear her wedding dress in half when two of them get inside it and express their jealous disbelief that she\u2019s about to marry a handsome guy. Kimmie Boubier, Wilson\u2019s character in Super Fun Night, is the butt of almost every joke (many of them about Spanx\u2014I counted five in the first episode alone). \n \n I wanted to love this show, just like I wanted to love Pitch Perfect (I did love Bachelorette, despite its characters\u2019 awful treatment of Becky, because I find Adam Scott singing \u201cI\u2019m Gonna Be (500 Miles)\u201d irresistible, and I love seeing Kirsten Dunst being a hot mess), but they both just left me feeling shortchanged\u2014especially Super Fun Night. After all the years of crappy role models, I was so psyched to see an actress\u2014who, like me, is a fat Australian girl obsessed with Salt-N-Pepa and improv comedy\u2014make it to the top of the comedy world, where she could\u2019ve pitched any show she wanted to. Imagine my disappointment when I saw her, Super Fun Night\u2019s star and one of its writers and executive producers, telling the world to keep laughing at the miserable fat girl who loses the handsome love interest to her skinny rival. ||||| Rookie is an online magazine and book series for teenagers.

Thank you for seven very special years! \u2734 \n \n Although she had no music out at this time last year, by now Lorde requires no introduction. Seventeen years old, from New Zealand, with a richly hushed voice that she lays over minimal beats\u2014you\u2019ve heard all this. You\u2019ve probably also heard her portrayed as some kind of alpha-Daria. According to one YouTube commenter (I SWEAR I WASN\u2019T READING YOUTUBE COMMENTS, THIS ONE WAS ALREADY AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE), \u201cShe\u2019s like that awkward-ass girl in the back of your class lol.\u201d According to many of the writers who have profiled her, she\u2019s the patron saint of Weird Girls Everywhere. \n \n What these people don\u2019t realize is that her reach goes far beyond a very hip sect on Tumblr. In fact, Lorde\u2019s song \u201cRoyals\u201d was #1 on the radio for nine weeks straight. Her debut album, Pure Heroine, got her four Grammy nominations. She is not niche. She is huge. But despite the commercial and critical success of her music, and the fact that she was signed to Universal at the age of 13, Lorde is continually portrayed as an underdog. Adult journalists tend to see only \u201cedgy\u201d-looking outsiders in the backs of classrooms identifying with her music, and totally miss the fact that hordes of snapchatting normies understand her, too, and vice versa. This is not only because they tend to underestimate Lorde\u2019s ability to appeal to the masses. They also underestimate the capacity of \u201cnormal\u201d teenagers to appreciate thoughtful, unflashy music. \n \n Sure, Lorde dresses like a witch and drips with sarcasm in interviews. Her best-known song denounces the materialism that other artists show off, and other ones say things like, \u201cI\u2019ll let you in on something big: I\u2019m not a white-teeth teen.\u201d But they also declare, \u201cI\u2019m little, but I\u2019m coming for the crown. I\u2019m little, but I\u2019m coming for the title held by everyone who\u2019s up.\u201d And \u201cWe\u2019re bigger than we ever dreamed, and I\u2019m in love with being queen.\u201d And \u201cI\u2019m doing this for the thrill of it, killing it, never not chasing the million things I want. And I am only as young as the minute is, full of it, getting pumped up on the little bright things I bought.\u201d Do not for one second mistake her stoicism for self-deprecation, or think it\u2019s only goth girls who relate. \n \n The album is a delightful cluster of such contradictions: Lorde is content with the world she\u2019s created for herself but eager to make waves in the one outside. Bored by the suburbs but endlessly in love with them. Critical of the other songs on the radio but wondering if she\u2019s any better (follow up a listen to \u201cRoyals\u201d with \u201cStill Sane\u201d: \u201cOnly bad people live to see their likeness set in stone\u2014what does that make me?\u201d). \n \n It\u2019s also insanely beautiful. A thorough listen feels like driving with shadows shifting across your face, quiet and thoughtful, in a car full of rowdier friends. Lorde elevates her suburban experiences to the level of mythology, becoming an empress surrounded by hounds, marking underpasses as her territory. She fixates on blood and veins as well as on the simple wonder of connecting with someone and wanting to experience everything with them. You can tell by the sound of her haunting voice that she means every word, and that she knows she\u2019s on the edge of erupting, as if to say: I\u2019ve been taking notes and keeping secrets, and I want to share them with you now. \n \n I met Ella (her given name) in October, after we\u2019d both discovered via online interviews and social media that we shared a mutual admiration (she\u2019s a Rookie!), so this interview got pretty conversational, but I liked that we could talk to each other as peers. We gave it a try on the night we met, but we were on a noisy restaurant rooftop and my recorder wasn\u2019t working. (I was also nervous about meeting her and embarrassed when she called me out for humming \u201cRoyals\u201d under my breath subconsciously.) (She was nice about it.) (It is a really catchy song.) She was generous enough to agree to a do-over last month, and we talked for over two hours on Skype. She addressed, among other things, the pervasive line that journalists dole out about her: \u201cWhile I dress and talk somewhat differently from other people whose songs are in the Top 40, I feel like more people dress like me than the media makes out.\u201d Instead of letting a few random sartorial choices narrow our expectations of music and music listeners, let us appreciate what Lorde\u2019s popularity says about all sorts of people, which is the only way to describe her demographic. And let us see what she has to say for herself, right here. \n \n TAVI: How does it feel to be home right now? \n \n LORDE: It feels really good. I\u2019m definitely not on holiday yet\u2014I\u2019ve been writing outlines for what I want to happen onstage for the tour and the next music video and this, like, big TV performance I\u2019ve got coming up. It\u2019s not work, per se, but\u2014yeah, work. \n \n I\u2019m curious, because I love what I do, but it is also a job, and everyone at times doesn\u2019t like their job. What do you do when it starts to feel too much like work? \n \n Often I\u2019m able to work on my own timeline\u2014I\u2019ll give myself enough time that if I don\u2019t feel like doing something, I can wait and do it a few days later or whatever. \n \n That\u2019s good. I want to start out by saying that what I want to do with this is\u2026I\u2019m in a unique position in interviewing you because we\u2019re the same age\u2013 \n \n Holla. \n \n And I feel like everything I read about you is like grown men writing\u2014 \n \n Oh my god, that tweet you made where you were like, \u201cShe laces her Converse\u2026\u201d I was like, \u201cThis is so accurate!\u201d There\u2019s a definite viewpoint of the think piece by an adult writing about kids. \n \n \"She giggles, lacing her Chuck Taylors. She may be famous, but she's still just a kid.\" -end of every profile of a well-known young person \u2014 Tavi Gevinson (@tavitulle) November 4, 2013 \n \n It\u2019s true! The end is always like, \u201cShe does [this childlike thing] but she also does [this adultlike thing]. Whoa!\u201d \n \n Mine is \u201cShe squeals\u2026\u201d \n \n Yeah! That\u2019s what I\u2019d just read when I wrote that! Or, no, it was a profile of Saoirse Ronan where they were like, \u201cThen she\u2019s just a kid in her Keds\u2026\u201d \n \n [Laughs] Yeah, so terrible. \n \n So I just want this to be, like\u2026a lot of our readers really relate to you, and I want this to be for them. Not music-journalism-y or about \u201cthe pop music landscape.\u201d \n \n Aw, yeah, yuck. Well, this is fun! ||||| The Wonder Years (1988\u20131993, ABC) \n \n This series was set in the 1960s and aired in the 1980s, but I first watched it as reruns in the late \u201990s, which I think proves that it is truly timeless. It follows Kevin Arnold, played by Fred Savage, as he navigates the transition from sixth grade to high school. Unlike shows that actually aired in the 1960s, The Wonder Years shows growing up in the suburbs for what it really is: underwhelming, haunting, and hilarious all at the same time. Kevin is obsessed with this girl named Winnie Cooper, who is the ultimate girl-next-door (and is played by the real-life math whiz Danica McKellar). Winnie is friendly and beautiful, yet smart and kinda elusive. Honestly, I wish this the show would have been about Winnie. She is my ultimate style icon (you can catch her sporting short bangs, cat-eye glasses, and overalls in the pilot episode alone). My parents both grew up in the \u201960s and would always say really nostalgic stuff when we\u2019d watch this together, and I\u2019d be all, \u201cUgh, guys, shut up!\u201d But now just thinking about the opening credits to this show makes me want to cry wistful tears. \u2014Gabby \n \n Seven Minutes in Heaven (1985) \n \n In my experience, a lot of the movies you adored as a kid don\u2019t really hold up when you revisit them five or 10 years later. But having recently watched this for the first time since the \u201990s, I can say with utmost confidence that Seven Minutes in Heaven is ONE OF THE BEST TEEN MOVIES EVER. It\u2019s a quiet, realistic depiction of the murky entanglements between best friends and first loves. A 15-year-old Jennifer Connelly plays the quiet, studious Natalie, who is smart but is still trying to figure people out. When her dad goes away to a conference, she immediately allows her best male friend, Jeff, to crash at her parentless place after he fights with his own stepdad. Their cohabitation is terribly innocent, though it\u2019s clear that Jeff is hopelessly in love with Natalie. Many mortifying things happen\u2014like when she accidentally walks in on him in the bathroom and realizes what shacking up truly means. Meanwhile, Natalie\u2019s best friend Polly (played by the awesome Maddie Corman) is less interested in love and devotion than good old-fashioned s-e-x, especially after a random encounter with a pro baseball player (and underwear model). The dialogue is so sweet and realistic, with Jennifer Connelly constantly dropping jewels like, \u201cParents and kids always fight. It\u2019s the way of the world.\u201d I could live inside this movie. \u2014Julianne \n \n This Christmas (2007) \n \n Named after Donny Hathaway\u2019s classic song, This Christmas follows the Whitfield family as they reunite for the holidays for the first time in four years. Ma\u2019Dere\u2019s children return to her quiet home with a whole lot of skeletons jingling noisily in their closets\u2014with the exception of Baby (played by a still sweet-faced Chris Brown). Quentin\u2019s on the run, Claude has two major secrets, Melanie\u2019s got a new boo, and there\u2019s some turbulence between career-driven, single Kelli and married Lisa, whose husband, Malcolm, is rather shady. The Whitfield kids work through the difficulties within and among themselves, and the warm-fuzzies-inducing moral of the story is that the bonds of family, trust, and love are the most important things of all. A part of me watches this movie every year for the epic baby-oil, belt, and shower scene (it\u2019s not what you think!) with Lisa and Malcolm. Another part of me watches for all the eye candy, including Lauren London, who plays Melanie. But mostly, each year I look forward to watching Baby\u2019s golden rendition of Otis Redding\u2019s \u201cTry A Little Tenderness,\u201d which is easily one of the most memorable moments in the film. \u2014Nova \n \n Angel (1999\u20132004, the WB) \n \n Angel was born out of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Buffy fans know Angel as the vampire with a soul, which was the result of a gypsy curse. He feels crushing guilt for his days as Angelus, one of the most ruthless vampires in Europe, and to help alleviate it, he works with Buffy to fight the big BAD. They also fall in love, and when that relationship ends somewhat disastrously, he heads to demon-filled L.A. and opens Angel Investigations to continue fighting evil. I came to both Buffy and Angel late, checking them both out for the first time just last year. On the advice of my brother, I watched them in tandem, and while you\u2019d probably get the most out of Angel that way because of the character crossover, it totally stands on its own. Two of my favorite characters are wholly original to Angel: Lorne, the demon lounge singer, and Fred, a physicist who was trapped in a demon dimension for five years (played by Amy Acker, one of my favorite actresses ever). All of the characters are multi-faceted\u2014they\u2019re dark and dramatic, as well as comedic. And that\u2019s what I love most about Angel: Its premise, about finding redemption, is serious, but there are a lot of downright hilarious moments. It\u2019s Joss Whedon doing what he does best! I really wish this show could have lasted forever, but at least it has eternal life on Netflix. \u2014Stephanie \n \n Jeux d\u2019enfants (2003) \n \n Jeux d\u2019enfants aka Love Me If You Dare tells the tale of Julien (Guillaume Canet) and Sophie (Marion Cotillard), friends who begin a mischievous game of dares as children (Julien pees in the principal\u2019s office!) that follows them into high school (Sophie wears a bra over a T-shirt during a class presentation!). As they become adults, it finally escalates into a sadistic competition that also is an excuse for them to stay connected to each other\u2014possibly forever. If you\u2019re a fan of unconventional love stories and the whimsy of movies like Am\u00e9lie, put Jeux d\u2019enfants in your queue immediately! You will either be charmed, irritated, or, hopefully, a little bit of both. Fun fact: Canet and Cotillard actually fell in love while making this movie and are still together today. \u2014Marie \n \n A Christmas Story (1983) \n \n A Christmas Story will always be synonymous with the holidays for me because it\u2019s been a favorite of my parents since they were young. I\u2019ve watched it almost every winter for as far back as I can remember, and because its protagonist, a grade-schooler named Ralphie, is so hilarious, it never gets old. I\u2019d watch as he groans about his father\u2019s questionable taste in home decor (e.g. the iconic fishnet-clad lamp leg that is the center of one the movie\u2019s plot lines), grimly dons a bunny suit gifted to him by a relative that thinks it\u2019s just soooo cute, and, most crucially, pines for a BB gun (the gift he most wishes will appear beneath the tree) regardless of the season\u2014although, of course, it\u2019s best around this time of year. This movie is a perfect portrait of exactly what\u2019s most exasperating AND most wonderful about being part of a family, which is why I love to watch it with my folks so much. See it with someone close to you, and \u201cYou\u2019ll shoot your eye out!\u201d will become a phrase that\u2019s much warmer-feeling than it sounds. \u2014Amy Rose \n \n Torchwood (2006\u20132011, BBC; 2011, Starz) \n \n I first found out about Torchwood while listening to a discussion panel about the show at San Diego Comic-Con. I had never seen an episode of this Doctor Who spin-off (Torchwood is an anagram of Doctor Who), so I didn\u2019t understand what the hell anyone was talking about as storylines and character motives were being dissected by diehard fans and the show\u2019s crew. All I knew was that John Barrowman, the only actor from the cast on the panel, was the most charismatic person I\u2019d ever been in the same room with. Based entirely on this guy\u2019s candor and amazing smile, I bought the two seasons of the show that were available at the time. The gamble paid off because Barrowman\u2019s charm comes across in every scene he\u2019s in. But it\u2019s not just him: This whole sci-fi drama, about a group of people tracking down aliens on Earth, is just incredible. The Torchwood team, including the immortal Captain Jack Harkness (Barrowman) and new recruit Gwen (Eve Myles\u2014who is just as captivating as Barrowman), deal with things like underground alien fight clubs, otherworldly technology that resurrects the dead, and cannibals. You get all of the mystery and adventure that make this genre so much fun, but the show is just as much about humanity and mortality as it is about extraterrestrials and the supernatural. In Torchwood: Miracle Day, the show\u2019s fourth season, human death in the world stops, which causes all kinds of practical and philosophical problems. It\u2019s pretty common these days for sci-fi shows and movies to have some sort of existential theme (you know, like using aliens to make a point about what it means to be human). But when characters on Torchwood confront things like death, which of course can be dramatic and entertaining, it\u2019s done in a way that inspires genuine sympathy and introspection. \u2014Amber \n \n The NeverEnding Story (1984) \n \n Sorry, I can\u2019t see. My eyes are filling with tears\u2026like every time I even think about this goddamn movie! The NeverEnding Story starts with a little boy, Bastian, who is being bullied at school. One day, he\u2019s drawn to a mysterious book in a dark little shop; he swipes it behind the owner\u2019s back, and then his adventure BEGINS. Squirrelled away in his school\u2019s attic, he spends the day reading about a world called Fantasia where the borders are disappearing into a malevolent force called The Nothing. Fantasia\u2019s ruler, the Childlike Empress, is ill because of The Nothing, and she summons the child warrior Atreyu to discover and banish the source of this danger. From the scenes of Bastian skipping school to read a book (MY FANTASY) to the wondrous characters\u2014the beautiful and wise Childlike Empress, Falkor the flying dragon, and a giant bat that continually falls asleep\u2014this film entranced me as a child. Throw in a magical amulet, the idea that every child (and their imagination) is important, and an amazing theme song (Limahl\u2019s \u201980s classic \u201cThe Neverending Story\u201d), and you\u2019ve got a film that will stick with me for life. \u2014Estelle \n \n Nirvana: MTV Unplugged in New York (1993, MTV; 2007, DVD release) \n \n Most bands in the \u201990s that went on MTV\u2019s acoustic performance series, MTV Unplugged, did versions of their greatest hits, but not Nirvana. Aside from \u201cCome As You Are\u201d and \u201cAll Apologies,\u201d the band went with their lesser known-material (they opened with \u201cAbout a Girl,\u201d which Kurt introduced by saying, \u201cThis is off our first record, most people don\u2019t own it\u201d) and an incredible selection of largely unknown cover songs (like the Meat Puppets\u2019 \u201cLake of Fire\u201d). The episode initially aired right around this time of year, and to me, a 14-year-old Nirvana fan, it was like a Christmas present from the band. It proved they could be just as powerful with all the distortion stripped away\u2014and Krist Novoselic playing an accordion! Four months later, when Kurt Cobain committed suicide, MTV played the episode nonstop, and it became the performance that immortalized him. It feels strangely prescient, and the song choices (\u201cJesus Doesn\u2019t Want Me for a Sunbeam\u201d by the Vaselines, \u201cThe Man Who Sold the World\u201d by David Bowie) and white stargazer lilies and black candles decorating the set are all eerie to take in now. But there are so many moments that are pure, beautiful Kurt, like when he forces a smile, chastises himself for screwing up a song, and jokes with his bandmates (\u201cWhat are they tuning back there? A harp?\u201d). My favorite songs are his solo version of the band\u2019s \u201cPennyroyal Tea\u201d and the cover of Lead Belly\u2019s \u201cWhere Did You Sleep Last Night.\u201d The moment during the last chorus, around 4:46 in this video, when he takes a deep breath and opens his eyes wide is EVERYTHING to me. \u2014Stephanie \n \n Home for the Holidays (1995) \n \n Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday, so it makes sense that my favorite holiday movie is a Thanksgiving movie\u2014one of a genre that clearly needs more love. Home for the Holidays, directed by Jodie Foster, stars Holly Hunter as a big-city art restorer who, yep, goes home to her parents\u2019 house to eat some turkey just as her own life is falling apart: She gets fired from her job, her love life is nonexistent, and her teenage daughter (Claire Danes in full-on My So-Called Life mode) is planning to lose her virginity. Anne Bancroft, one of modern cinema\u2019s sexiest women, plays Hunter\u2019s mother in a chain-smoking, wig-wearing, decidedly unglamorous part. Robert Downey, Jr. is Hunter\u2019s brother, and even though RDJ has said he barely remembers making the movie because he was so high during its filming, I still find his goofiness totally charming. The reason this movie is so good is because it feels wonderfully true to life. Are any of us ever really adults when we\u2019re at our parents\u2019 house? I don\u2019t think so. There\u2019s a romance in there, too, but that part doesn\u2019t even matter\u2014it\u2019s all about being in the kitchen with your siblings at midnight, talking about how crazy your parents are, and gorging on leftovers. \u2014Emma S \n \n The Family Stone (2005) \n \n This is one of my favorite holiday movies and maybe one of my favorite movies, period. It\u2019s Christmas, and the grown Stone children are converging on their parents\u2019 cozily decorated New England home, which you\u2019ll probably wish you could live in or at least snoop around. Some of my favorite actors play the Stones: Diane Keaton is the matriarch, Craig T. Nelson is the dad, Luke Wilson is the slacker brother, Rachel McAdams is the cynical sis, and Dermot Mulroney is Everett, the Good-Looking One. Everett brings his new fianc\u00e9e Meredith (played by Sarah Jessica Parker) home for the holidays, and let\u2019s just say the Stones aren\u2019t warming up to her. What follows is a story of awkward encounters, clashing \u2018tudes, and general mayhem. The Family Stone is better than other films about crazy, family-oriented Christmas antics, though, because of the performances. The snark-levels are high with Wilson, McAdams, and Keaton\u2019s characters, and they make great foils to Parker\u2019s uptight Meredith. Not to mention the family dynamics in the movie are just straight-up real. Those weird political conversations that happen at every fucking holiday gathering? This movie hits that nail right on the head in a particularly cringe-worthy scene in which Meredith explains her feelings regarding homosexuality and what\u2019s \u201cnormal\u201d to the family\u2019s gay son Thad and his partner, Patrick. In The Family Stone, Christmas isn\u2019t sugarplums and fairies: it\u2019s children getting older and the strain of family politics. Oh, and Claire Danes makes an appearance as Meredith\u2019s charming younger sister! Just watch it, folks. \u2014Hazel \u2666",

The perfect bookend to a tear-stained summer, \u201cIf I Stay\u201d has arrived in theaters with the same good taste, modest cool factor and shameless tear-jerking that made its predecessor such a multi-hankie hit. \n \n \u201cIf I Stay,\u201d which was adapted by R.J. Cutler (\u201cA Perfect Candidate,\u201d \u201cThe September Issue\u201d) from Gayle Forman\u2019s novel, hews largely to the same formula as \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars\u201d: An attractive young couple grapples with first love and looming mortality against a scenic backdrop, the mechanics of sexual awakenings safely couched in soft-focus ellipses (\u201cAdam, I\u2019ve never . . . \u201d). As in \u201cThe Fault in Our Stars,\u201d this story is told from the point of view of an exceptionally self-aware young woman staring down impending death. Here, though, she\u2019s anxiously watching over herself as she lies in a coma, trying to decide whether life is still worth living after nearly losing it and everything else in a horrifying car crash. \n \n It\u2019s a maudlin, potentially mawkish setup, but first-time feature director Cutler and his screenwriter, Shauna Cross, put an amber glow on even the toughest aspects of a story in which everything is just about perfect (until it most decidedly isn\u2019t). Chloe Grace Moretz plays Mia Hall, a 17-year-old cello prodigy whose happy, laid-back life with her former punk-rocker parents is upended when she meets a handsome guitarist named Adam (Jamie Blackley). Their mildly piquant romance \u2014 she idolizes Yo-Yo Ma, he\u2019s more of a Ramones guy \u2014 is of the classic opposites-attract variety, spiced by dashes of O. Henry\u2019s lyrical irony. At a Halloween party, eager to please each other, she dons a platinum wig as Debbie Harry and he comes dressed as Beethoven. \n \n It\u2019s all played for minimum dramatic tension and maximum aestheticized wish fulfillment, heightened by Cutler\u2019s tendency to film everything slightly out of focus and Cross\u2019s to write fuzzy-wuzzy dialogue like \u201cAdam, that song was great.\u201d Even more idealized is Mia\u2019s family, headed by a mom and dad who clearly trained at the Pitchfork School for Cool Hipster Parenting. Played with warmth and easy understatement by Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard, Mia\u2019s \u2019rents casually name-check Iggy Pop and Kim Gordon as they roam around their brightly painted Portland bungalow, bedecked with the requisite number of cred-signifying posters and musical detritus. It\u2019s all too flawless to be believed \u2014 we never see Mia argue with her parents, much less with her Alice Cooper-quoting little brother \u2014 but the colorful, cozy domestic portrait makes it that much more unsettling when, on a snowy road one day, it all comes to a shatteringly violent end. \n \n \u201cIf I Stay\u201d toggles between two worlds: Mia\u2019s desperate, barefooted sojourn at the hospital and flashbacks to the life she may or may not decide to leave behind. Although the emotionalism begins to drag the narrative down as her anguished vigil goes on and on and on, Cutler smoothly navigates Mia\u2019s double-sided experience, albeit in a way that recalls the \u201cNashville\u201d episodes he has directed more than the ethereal otherworldliness of, say, \u201cThe Lovely Bones.\u201d \n \n Moretz, best known for her spiky, moodily effective turns in such tough films as \u201cKick-Ass\u201d and \u201cLet Me In,\u201d submerges her most interesting contours in service to a blandly edge-free character. Blackley is slightly more convincing as the sweaty, discreetly pierced frontman of an on-the-rise, safely pseudo hard-rockin\u2019 band. \n \n Granted, the group isn\u2019t channeling Joey Ramone as much as Clear Channel\u2019s pop heartthrob du jour. But the musical sequences \u2014 including an impromptu Smashing Pumpkins jam in Mia\u2019s back yard \u2014 bring some welcome verve to talky scenes of soulful heart-to-hearts and teary hand-wringing. Rest assured, there\u2019s plenty of that, too, in \u201cIf I Stay.\u201d But even at its most wrenchingly painful, the film readily delivers generous dollops of pleasure. \n \n \u2605 \u2605 \u00bd \n \n PG-13.

Photo/Video: Warner Bros. \n \n The dairy industry doesn't have a monopoly on milking machines. \"If I Stay\" tries to squeeze every last drop of feeling from the plight of its teenage heroine. A gifted musician with nurturing parents, Mia (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) finds herself caught in limbo between life and death after surviving, although barely, a terrible crash on a snow-covered Oregon highway during a family outing. Surveying the accident scene as an ethereal wraith, she can see the loved ones she has lost. She can also see her own shattered body, first by the side of the road and then in a coma in the intensive-care unit of a Portland hospital. What she must decide now, in the face of her loss, is whether to stay among the living. What young audiences will decide soon is whether the movie's many moments of genuine sweetness and affecting tenderness can survive the persistent silliness of Mia's out-of-body excursions. \n \n She is a busybody wraith, chasing around the hospital to keep tabs on herself, her friends and her extended family while the narrative suffers frequent, spasmodic flashbacks to the life she may be leaving. The supernatural element came straight from the book, the popular young-adult novel of the same name by Gayle Forman, and disembodied heroes or heroines have figured in successful screen entertainments from \"Topper\" through \"Beetlejuice\" to \"Ghost.\" But serious drama is trickier, as witness the unlovely fate of Peter Jackson's \"The Lovely Bones.\" What works for readers, left free to produce their own versions of fantasy devices, can be gigglesome for audiences confronted with a film's prefab literalism. \n \n At its best, \"If I Stay\" evokes the primacy of friendship, the warmth of family\u2014Mireille Enos and Joshua Leonard play Mia's lively ex-hippie parents\u2014and the urgency of adolescent love: Jamie Blackley as Adam, Mia's boyfriend, has some of the film's stronger scenes. (The strongest may be a heartfelt speech by that old pro Stacy Keach, who plays Mia's grandfather.) But the production as a whole is awfully clumsy, and Ms. Moretz, who is only 17, needs more help than she gets from the first-time feature director, R.J. Cutler. So does Mia stay or go? Let's just say that she's a child of her generation, with an unshakable sense of empowerment. Never mind what God or random chance may have in store for her. \"I'm running the show,\" she declares toward the end. Deathless words from a near-death decider. \n \n Rewind DVD //Streaming //Download \n \n 'Spirited Away' (2001) \n \n Hayao Miyazaki's animated masterpiece certainly qualifies as a ghost story, but it's also a coming-of-age story in which a girl takes refuge in her fantasies and emerges from them a stronger person. The 10-year-old heroine, Chihiro, finds herself alone after her parents make memorable pigs of themselves at an abandoned restaurant, and forges a new life for herself in a glittering, steaming hot-springs resort where spirits of every shape, disposition and composition\u2014good and evil, opaque and transparent\u2014come to refresh themselves.

Bowe Bergdahl is on a flight from Europe and is scheduled to arrive in San Antonio, Texas, within hours. \n \n Bergdahl had been in a military hospital in Landstuhl, Germany, since he was released in Afghanistan after five years of Taliban captivity. \n \n He is expected to be taken to a military hospital in the Texas city for continued rehabilitation. \n \n \"I can confirm that he is now en route to the United States aboard a U.S. military aircraft, having departed Ramstein Air Base earlier this afternoon,\" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement Thursday. \"He will arrive in San Antonio early tomorrow morning, where he will continue the reintegration process at Brooke Army Medical Center.\" \n \n \"Our first priority is making sure that Sgt. Bergdahl continues to get the care and support he needs.\" \n \n Previously, three U.S. officials had told CNN that the soldier would arrive in Texas at midnight local time (1 a.m. ET). \n \n Bergdahl was exchanged on May 31 for five Taliban figures detained at the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. \n \n The swap sparked a controversy that touches on a range of volatile issues -- ending the Afghanistan war, releasing Guantanamo detainees, accusations by members of Bergdahl's unit that he deserted -- and it comes in an election year that has further widened the partisan divide in Washington. \n \n Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel has defended the deal, saying it was Bergdahl's last and best chance to get out. Critics have said the cost of the swap was too high, and that Congress should have been notified in advance. \n \n Slow recovery \n \n Bergdahl is \"continuing to improve every day,\" Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said this week. The solider had not spoken with his family. \n \n The \"decision to speak with the family is a decision the returnee has to make when he or she is emotionally in the right place to make the phone call,\" Warren said. \n \n Bergdahl went missing on June 30, 2009, in Afghanistan's Paktika province, where he was deployed with the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division. \n \n An Army fact-finding investigation conducted in the months after his disappearance concluded he left his outpost deliberately and of his own free will, according to an official who was briefed on the report. \n \n The Army has no definitive finding that Bergdahl deserted because that would require knowing his intent -- something officials couldn't learn without talking to the soldier, a U.S. military official told CNN. \n \n As Bergdahl recovers, details are slowly emerging about the conditions he endured during five years of captivity. \n \n Citing an American official, The New York Times has reported that Bergdahl told medical staff that the box he was kept in for weeks at a time was pitch black and like a shark cage. \n \n CNN has reported that Bergdahl has said he was kept in a small box after trying to escape, according to a senior U.S. official, who spoke on the condition of not being identified. The official also told CNN that Bergdahl suffers from psychological trauma caused by physical abuse. \n \n In his own words \n \n The exact conditions of his captivity are not known, and Bergdahl has not spoken publicly since his release. \n \n But on Thursday, The Daily Beast published two letters the solider reportedly wrote to his family while imprisoned by the Taliban. The website obtained the letters by \"sources in contact with the Taliban.\" It confirmed their authenticity with U.S. and Western officials. \n \n In the letters -- dated 2012 and 2013 -- Bergdahl discusses his life and partially explains why he disappeared in 2009. \n \n \"To my friends & family, in regards to the circomestance (sic) here, I am as well as can be here,\" he wrote. \"I am given food and drink.\" \n \n Bergdahl had harsh words for Army leadership. \n \n \"Leadership was lacking, if not non-existent. The conditions were bad and looked to be getting worse for the men that where actuly (sic) the ones risking thier (sic) lives from attack,\" he wrote. \n \n \"If this letter makes it to the U.S.A., tell those involved in the investigation that there are more sides to the cittuwation (sic),\" Bergdahl said. \"Please tell D.C. to wait for all evadince (sic) to come in.\" \n \n Hagel on Bergdahl deal \n \n Hagel appeared Wednesday at a House Armed Services Committee hearing to defend the swap, where Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Florida, appeared to strike a nerve when he pressed the defense chief on why it was taking the U.S. military so long to interview Bergdahl. \n \n Hagel already had fielded lawmakers' accusations that the White House overstepped presidential authority and negotiated with terrorists to gain Bergdahl's freedom. \n \n Hagel started to explain that doctors treating Bergdahl will decide when he is ready to talk, but Miller cut him off. \n \n \"Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Why hasn't he been returned to the United States?\" Miller asked, noting that wounded soldiers from battle zones get flown back for treatment within days. \"You're trying to tell me that he's being held at Landstuhl, Germany, because of his medical condition?\" \n \n Hagel responded, \"Congressman, I hope you're not implying anything other than that,\" as the two continued to talk over each other. \n \n \"I don't like the implication of the question,\" Hagel said at one point, and when Miller persisted about injured combat troops coming back to the United States quickly, Hagel raised his voice. \n \n \"This isn't just about a physical situation,\" he said. \"This guy was held for almost five years in God knows what kind of conditions. ...

They understand the landlord\u2019s concern but say the goal is to keep people safe and start a conversation. \n \n Please enable Javascript to watch this video ||||| Note: This article has been corrected. \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 The Army has warned its recruiters to treat the gun-toting civilians gathering at centers across the country in the wake of the Chattanooga, Tenn., shooting as a security threat. \n \n Soldiers should avoid anyone standing outside the recruiting centers attempting to offer protection and report them to local law enforcement and the command if they feel threatened, according to a U.S. Army Recruiting Command policy letter issued Monday. \n \n Armed citizens \u2014 some associated with activist groups and militias \u2014 were standing vigil outside recruiting centers in Wisconsin, Georgia, Tennessee, Idaho and elsewhere this week, saying they want to provide protection to servicemembers barred from carrying firearms on duty. Four Marines and a sailor were killed by Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez, a 24-year-old Kuwait-born resident of Tennessee, during an attack Thursday on a strip mall recruiting center and a Navy facility that is being investigated as an act of terrorism. \n \n Abdulazeez fired into the front of the recruiting station but there were no casualties. The five servicemembers were killed during an attack on the Navy Operational Support Center. A Navy officer and a Marine reportedly fired at the gunman, although it is unclear why they were armed. It is against Defense Department policy for anyone other than military police or law enforcement to carry weapons on federal property. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m sure the citizens mean well, but we cannot assume this in every case and we do not want to advocate this behavior,\u201d according to the Army Command Operations Center-Security Division letter, which was authenticated by the service. \n \n Recruiters were ordered not to interact or acknowledge the armed civilians, who have been greeted by a mix of concern, indifference and gratitude by the public. \n \n \u201cIf questioned by these alleged concerned citizens, be polite, professional and terminate the conversation immediately and report the incident to local law enforcement \u2026,\u201d the command advised. \n \n As the incidents crop up around the country, police could be asked to confront the civilians with guns on the Army\u2019s behalf. \n \n \u201cEnsure your recruiters clearly articulate to local police the civilian may be armed and in possession of a conceal/carry permit,\u201d it told the centers. \n \n The command said recruiters should also immediately fill out an Army security report. \n \n Kelli Bland, a spokeswoman for Army Recruiting Command, said the service has been increasing vigilance following the Chattanooga shooting and that local residents can help in other ways. \n \n \u201cLocal communities can support our security by reporting suspicious activity, particularly around recruiting centers,\u201d Bland wrote in an email to Stars and Stripes. \n \n Concerned citizens began gathering at the centers shortly after the shooting in Tennessee, and governors in some states ordered recruiters to armories or to be armed for protection against potential terrorist attacks. Congress has also pushed for the Defense Department to lift its current policy. \n \n The founder and president of Oath Keepers, a Constitution activist group based in Las Vegas, issued a national call Tuesday to guard centers, while members were already guarding centers in Tennessee, Arkansas and Oklahoma, president Stewart Rhodes told the Associated Press. \n \n Rhodes told the news service it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely insane\u201d that recruiters aren\u2019t allowed to be armed. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re sitting ducks,\u201d Rhodes said Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019d be better off if they were walking down the streets of Baghdad, because at least in Baghdad, they could move. Here, they\u2019re stationary.\u201d \n \n In Lewiston, Idaho, three men with a group known as \u201c3 percenters\u201d \u2014 a national alliance with members who prepare \u201cfor any situation, man-made or natural\u201d \u2014 were standing watch outside a recruiting office this week, the TNS wire service reported. \n \n \u201cThey supported us, and now we\u2019re here showing them that we support them,\u201d said Matt Dillard, of Clarkston, Wash., who was among the men. \n \n tritten.travis@stripes.com \n \n Twitter: @Travis_Tritten \n \n \n \n Correction: An earlier version of this report misidentified the location of Clarkston. It is in Washington state. ||||| After four Marines and a sailor were killed by a lone gunman last week, armed civilians have volunteered to stand guard at military recruiting stations around the country \u2014 but troops are being warned to keep their distance and alert law enforcement of their presence. \n \n In a memo published Tuesday that was obtained by Marine Corps Times, Lt. Gen. Mark Brilakis, the head of Marine Corps Recruiting Command, advised troops not to support the \"armed citizen\" volunteers in any way. \n \n \"These citizens' presence, while well intentioned, will be counterproductive to our recruiting operations,\" Brilakis wrote. \n \n Maj. Garron Garn, a spokesman for MCRC, confirmed the authenticity of the memo. \n \n \"We are concerned for the safety of not only our Marines, but the public as a whole, and while most armed citizens have the best intentions at heart, it is not unrealistic to assume a possible incident like a negligent discharge may occur,\" he said in a statement provided to Marine Corps Times. \"Additionally, we are concerned that armed citizens may detract interested individuals from entering our offices, which ultimately negatively effects our recruiting mission. We ask that these concerned citizens show their support in other ways that are less impactful on our mission attainment.\" \n \n If armed volunteers appear in the vicinity of any Marine Corps offices, Brilakis wrote in his memo, Marines should immediately call local law enforcement to deal with them. \n \n \"Inform [law enforcement officers] that the Marine Corps did not request nor do we support [armed citizens] being in proximity of our facilities,\" he wrote. \n \n Marines were also instructed to call the relevant Army Corps of Engineers representative to notify the lessor of the recruiting office property of the presence of the armed individuals. \n \n Troops should not interact or engage with the armed citizens, Brilakis wrote, unless \"absolutely necessary.\" If such an interaction is unavoidable, he wrote, Marines should tell the volunteers their intent is appreciated, but their presence is unnecessary, and disruptive to ongoing recruiting operations. \n \n Under no circumstances should Marines allow an armed citizen to enter the recruiting office, or handle the citizen's weapon in any way, he wrote. \n \n The memo was distributed as a Fast Response on Short Transition, or FROST call \u2014 a system used by Marines to disseminate information rapidly throughout a command or series of commands. The Army has issued a similar warning to its recruiters, Stars and Stripes reported. \n \n Marine Gunnery Sgt. Thomas Sullivan, Lance Cpl. Squire K. Wells, Staff Sgt. David Wyatt, Sgt. Carson Holmquist and Navy Logistics Specialist 2nd Class Randall Smith were killed in the July 16 shooting, which took place at the Navy Operational Support Center in Chattanooga. The shooter, Mohammad Abdulazeez, also fired rounds into a nearby recruiting station, wounding one Marine in the leg. \n \n Since then, incidences of civilians guarding recruiting stations have been reported from Colorado Springs to Texas. Two veterans' organizations, the Oathkeepers and the Three Percenters, have actively encouraged their members to guard local stations in an effort they're calling Operation Warrior Guardian. \n \n Oath Keepers Greg Schillen, left, and Adam Bulder stand guard in front of the military recruitment offices on July 22 in Burlington, Wash., with Schillen's two dogs Clyde, left, and Buddy. \n \n Photo Credit: Scott Terrell / Skagit Valley Herald via AP \n \n In Lancaster, Ohio, an armed man guarding an Army recruiting office was charged with a misdemeanor after accidentally firing his AR15 rifle on Thursday, the Columbus Dispatch reported. \n \n Marine veteran Bradley Toler was one armed volunteer who was asked to leave the premises of a local recruiting station. A former infantry lance corporal who left the Marines in 2013, Toler went to his local Marine Corps recruiting office in Jacksonville, North Carolina, on Wednesday armed with a Mosin-Nagant bolt-action rifle and a Taurus Judge revolver. \n \n He stood outside the station for about two hours. During that time, Toler said he was thanked by civilian and military passers-by and offered bottled water by passing drivers. Ultimately, though, property owner Coldwell Banker notified the Jacksonville Police, who asked him to leave. \n \n While Toler said he left willingly, his belief in the effectiveness of armed volunteers was unshaken. \n \n \"The great thing about this county is we stood up without wanting anything,\" Toler, 25, said of the grassroots effort to guard recruiting stations. \"The biggest way to substantially lower the possibility of an attack is to have your presence there.\"",

Police told a group of volunteers to stop guarding a recruitment center in Lancaster, Ohio, after one of them accidentally fired a shot into the pavement, reports the Columbus Dispatch. Christopher Reed, 28, told police that his AR-15 rifle went off while he was taking ammunition out so he could show it to somebody who asked to look at it, the Dispatch reports. He was charged with discharging a firearm within city limits after somebody from the recruitment center called police. Similar groups have turned up at recruiting centers across the country in the wake of last week's Chattanooga shootings, though the Army has ordered recruiters to treat the \"alleged concerned citizens\" as a security threat and avoid interacting with them, Stars and Stripes reports. A Marine Corps Recruiting Command spokesman tells Marine Corps Times that while volunteers may have the \"best intentions,\" they're not welcome, and Marines have been told to call police if they turn up.

    "document": "BP on Tuesday accused a Texas lawyer of fraudulently driving up its settlement costs in the 2010 Gulf Coast oil spill by claiming to represent tens of thousands of clients who turned out to be \u201cphantoms.\u201d \n \n In a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court in New Orleans, the oil giant, which has been fighting the administration of a settlement with plaintiffs in the courtroom and in the news media, claimed that it relied on the client count supplied by the lawyer, Mikal C. Watts, in 2010 when it put $2.3 billion into a special compensation program for the seafood industry. The company, citing \u201cbrazen fraud,\u201d is asking the court to allow it to stop payments and reclaim some of the unspent money. \n \n The more than 40,000 deckhands claimed as clients by Mr. Watts constituted nearly 80 percent of the people projected to file claims under the program, the company said in court papers. \n \n In a statement, a lawyer for Mr. Watts, Robert McDuff, called BP\u2019s actions \u201canother of a series of efforts to walk away from the settlement to which it agreed.\u201d He said his client \u201cnever committed identity theft and did not defraud BP or anyone else.\u201d \n \n Mr. Watts, a prominent Democratic fund-raiser who is regarded as a formidable litigator, has said that his clients came through referrals from other lawyers. Mr. McDuff stated that Mr. Watts filed claims \u201cin good faith that legitimate claims were being filed for real people.\u201d \n \n BP, which has paid nearly $13 billion in claims to businesses, individuals and the government so far, has paid out $1 billion from the seafood fund so far. The company said that 24,520 seafood claims were ultimately filed, and of these, fewer than 5,000 were filed on behalf of individuals. Under the structure of the fund agreed to by BP and plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and approved by the judge, any money not distributed to seafood workers based on their claims would be given out in a second round. The company does not argue that the workers engaged in wrongful conduct, but said the inflated size of the fund would mean an undeserved \u201cwindfall\u201d to members of the class. \n \n Mr. Watts ultimately filed just 648 individual crew claims through the seafood fund, BP said, and just eight have been found eligible for payment. (Seventeen are pending.) That means, the company said, that \u201c98 percent of the Watts claimants never even filed a claim\u201d with the program, and \u201c96 percent of the claims that he did file have been denied.\u201d \n \n Mr. Watts has since filed 43,976 claims under a separate compensation program intended to address claims that had been excluded from the settlement agreement. In examining those claims, the company said it found that 40 percent of the claims used Social Security numbers that belonged to someone other than the person supposedly making the claim; 13 percent gave incomplete numbers or obvious fakes such as 000-00-0001. Five percent of the numbers belonged to dead people. \u201cThe inference of fraud is overwhelming,\u201d the company stated in its complaint. \n \n BP has argued for months that the claims process is rife with fraud and has paid out claims from people who had no actual losses related to the spill. The federal judge in the case, Carl J. Barbier, appointed former F.B.I. director Louis J. Freeh to investigate the allegations. Mr. Freeh found that the process itself was not corrupt, but did find incidents of conflict of interest and fraud among individual lawyers and staff members of the fund. \n \n Since then, the company has asked the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, to order changes in the way that the settlement fund is run. That court has ordered Judge Barbier to \u201cgive further consideration\u201d to the company\u2019s complaints; Judge Barbier has temporarily halted payments. \n \n In July 2012, Mr. Watts hosted a $35,800-a-plate event for President Obama at his home. Judge Barbier named him to the committee of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers that helps run the litigation; he resigned from the Plaintiffs\u2019 Steering Committee on March 13 this year, however, not long after Secret Service Agents executed search warrants at his San Antonio law office, a move that the Department of Justice officials suggested was related to the questions about his clients in the BP case. \n \n Mr. Watts\u2019s client submissions were initially challenged by Kenneth R. Feinberg, who ran the first version of the settlement office after the disaster. Concerns about the claims were first reported in an April 2011 article in The New York Times. \n \n Lawyers for plaintiffs in the case argued that BP is using the Watts controversy as an excuse to stop payments on the much larger program that affects deserving claimants. In a statement, the lawyers, Stephen J. Herman and James P. Roy, said \u201cthe notion that the number of deckhands was the driving factor during negotiations in determining the overall amount is absurd,\u201d and that just $130 million was allocated to deckhands. \n \n \u201cBP\u2019s overreaching attempt to hold the entire seafood program hostage is part of its continuing effort to rewrite history and the settlement agreement,\u201d the lawyers said, \u201cand is unfair to the hardworking men and women of the seafood industry whose livelihoods were destroyed by BP\u2019s reckless conduct.\u201d ||||| Courts \n \n Companies are punching back hard at plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, and today BP (BP) threw what it described as a haymaker at Mikal Watts, one of the most influential mass-tort attorneys in the country. \n \n BP filed a civil-fraud lawsuit against Watts and his firm, San Antonio-based Watts Guerra, accusing him of claiming to represent tens of thousands of \u201cphantom\u201d claimants in litigation concerning the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. In the unusual suit filed in federal court in New Orleans, BP said that it relied on Watts\u2019s representations when it agreed to a $2.3 billion portion of its settlement with people and businesses involved with the seafood industry and harmed by the massive contamination. \n \n \u201cThe facts of this case shout fraud,\u201d Geoff Morrell, BP\u2019s chief U.S. spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. \u201cTens of thousands of Mikal Watts\u2019s clients have proved to be phantoms. Mr. Watts\u2019s false representations improperly inflated the value of potential claims against the Seafood Compensation Program and resulted in an overblown $2.3 billion fund. Under these circumstances, BP is not going to stand idly by and allow payments to proceed without first addressing the fraudulent conduct.\u201d \n \n Robert McDuff, an attorney representing Watts, described his client in a statement as \u201can innocent man\u201d and said he \u201cnever committed identity theft and did not defraud BP or anyone else.\u201d The statement added: \u201cAll actions taken were in good faith that legitimate claims were being filed for real people who had been hurt by PB\u2019s gross negligence. With respect to those who applied for the settlement, he forwarded the documentation they provided to the independent special master in charge of reviewing settlement claims.\u201d \n \n Beyond the BP litigation, the Watts has helped lead mass suits against various pharmaceutical manufacturers and other companies. A leading Democrat in Texas, he has been a major financial backer of President Barack Obama. Watts is also under federal criminal investigation as a result of questions about how he gathered clients in the BP case. In response to the criminal probe, his defense lawyer has said Watts did nothing wrong. \n \n BP said that it uncovered the alleged Watts fraud by checking Social Security records for his supposed clients. Watts had claimed to represent more than 40,000 deckhands who suffered economic injuries from the 2010 spill\u2014more than 76 percent of the individual crew members projected to be potential claimants, BP said. The company asserted that more than half of Watts\u2019s claimants simply don\u2019t exist, and Social Security numbers for 40 percent of the claimants allegedly belonged to another living person. For 13 percent, the Social Security number given was \u201cincomplete or a \u2018dummy\u2019 number (e.g. a number such as 000-00-001),\u201d BP added. \u201cFor 5 percent, the Social Security number belonged to a dead person other than the named claimant.\u201d \n \n Watts ultimately filed only 648 individual claims under the seafood-industry program, fewer than 2 percent of the more than 40,000 he originally purported to represent, BP said. Of those 648, only eight have been found eligible for payment by the Seafood Compensation Program, according to BP, with 17 claims pending. \n \n Earlier this year, in the wake of federal agents executing search warrants at Watts Guerra\u2019s offices in San Antonio, Watts resigned from the Plaintiffs Steering Committee overseeing the multifaceted spill litigation against BP. The oil company has been battling with the steering committee over a separate portion of the pollution settlement: a $9 billion pact intended to compensate businesses outside of the seafood industry. BP has complained that claims worth hundreds of millions dollars in the $9 billion settlement are turning out to be exaggerated or \u201cfictitious,\u201d an allegation the steering committee contests. A spokesman for the committee didn\u2019t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. \n \n Under the seafood industry pact, about $1 billion has already been paid out, BP said. By means of its fraud suit against Watts and related actions today, BP said it is seeking to recover the portion of the remaining $1.3 billion that \u201cresulted from fraud.\u201d",

Five aircraft flying over the zone on Friday also spotted unidentified objects. \n \n But officials involved in the search, mindful of the amount of detritus adrift in the world\u2019s oceans, cautioned that the sightings were inconclusive on their own. \u201cIt is not known how much flotsam, such as from fishing activities, is ordinarily there,\u201d the Maritime Safety Authority said in a statement. \n \n A new analysis of radar data from March 8, as Flight 370 veered off its intended route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and instead flew west over Peninsular Malaysia and then south over the Indian Ocean, compelled officials to shift the search area on Friday to a zone about 1,100 miles west of Perth. \n \n The analysis showed that the plane was moving faster than investigators had previously estimated and therefore it would have burned fuel more quickly and possibly fallen into the Indian Ocean farther north than previously believed, officials said. \n \n The new search area is about 700 miles northeast of a zone that had been the focus of search efforts for most of the week. \n \n The revision of the search area was based largely on work done by analysts from Boeing in Seattle, part of an international team of experts collaborating with Malaysian investigators, officials here said. \n \n They arrived at their conclusions after re-evaluating the radar data and weighing other factors such as the amount of fuel on the plane when it took off from Kuala Lumpur and its altitude as it headed over the south Indian Ocean, Malaysian officials added, offering no further elaboration. \n \n The new search area presents more favorable conditions for the search than the previous area, in part because it has less inclement weather and water conditions and is closer to Perth, the departure point for the search planes, officials said. \n \n It is also only a fifth of the size of the previous search area, though still large: 123,000 square miles, or 319,000 square kilometers, which is roughly the size of New Mexico or Poland. \n \n But Australian and Malaysian officials cautioned that the new zone also posed considerable challenges. \u201cWe are trying to find small bits of wreckage in a vast ocean,\u201d said Prime Minister Tony Abbott of Australia. \u201cAnd while we are throwing everything we have at it, the task goes on.\u201d \n \n Continue reading the main story Advertisement \n \n As the search was underway on Saturday, Hishammuddin Hussein, Malaysia\u2019s defense minister, stopped by a hotel near Kuala Lumpur to meet with the relatives of Chinese citizens who were aboard Flight 370. The Malaysian government has endured withering criticism by the relatives and friends of Chinese passengers, who have accused it of withholding information about the disappearance of the plane and not doing enough to find it. \n \n Speaking to reporters after the closed-door meeting, Mr. Hishammuddin said the families wanted assurances that the search-and-rescue operation would continue. \u201cAs long as there is even a remote chance of a survivor, we will pray and do whatever it takes,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the hardest part of my life at the moment, meeting up with the families.\u201d \n \n The recovery of debris from Flight 370 would provide final confirmation that the plane had crashed into the ocean and offer at least partial resolution to the families and friends of the passengers and crew. It might also help solve perhaps the most enduring mystery of the plane\u2019s disappearance: What or who caused it to veer so sharply off course? \n \n When debris is found quickly enough after a crash into the sea, investigators can trace its drift back to the impact site and conduct an underwater search to recover the plane\u2019s black boxes. But in the case of Flight 370, any debris, if found, might well have drifted hundreds of miles in the three weeks since the plane\u2019s disappearance and be of limited use in locating the crash site. \n \n Still, recovered items from the plane might allow investigators to rule in or out certain events that could have precipitated a crash. Scorch marks, for example, might indicate that there was a fire, and the nature of any fire damage could offer clues about its source. \n \n In the case of the crash of Air France Flight 447 in 2009, the fact that the oxygen masks had not deployed and that life vests remained in their pouches indicated that those on board had not had time to prepare for an impact. Investigators also deduced from the damage that the plane hit the water at high speed, and they were able to tell which part of the plane hit the water first. \n \n The approaching winter in the Southern Hemisphere could present serious obstacles, and some experts said that an underwater search-and-recovery mission would not be possible in the short term as weather conditions deteriorate. \n \n But while the wreckage of the plane probably rests in cold, deep waters and is unlikely to degrade significantly in the coming months, experts said, the prospect of a delay would be hard for search experts to explain to the family members and to politicians who want to demonstrate that they are doing everything possible to find out what happened. ||||| PERTH, Australia (AP) \u2014 A day after the search for the Malaysian jetliner shifted to a new area of the Indian Ocean, ships on Saturday plucked objects from the sea to determine whether they were related to the missing jet.

(Associated Press) \n \n Meanwhile, a Chinese military plane scanning part of the search zone, which is roughly the size of Poland, spotted several objects floating in the sea, including two bearing colors of the missing jet. \n \n It was not immediately clear whether those objects were related to the investigation into what happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared March 8 en route from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, to Beijing, and officials said the second day of searching in the new area ended with no evidence found of the jet. \n \n Dozens of relatives of passengers on the missing plane were to fly from Beijing to Kuala Lumpur on Sunday to seek answers from Malaysia's government as to what happened to their loved ones. Two-thirds of the 229 passengers aboard Flight 370 were Chinese, and their relatives have expressed deep frustration with Malaysian authorities since the plane went missing. \n \n Ships from China and Australia on Saturday scooped up items described only as \"objects from the ocean,\" but none were \"confirmed to be related\" to Flight 370, said the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, which is overseeing the search. \n \n A Chinese Ilyushin IL-76 plane spotted three floating objects, China's official Xinhua News Agency said, a day after several planes and ships combing the newly targeted area, which is closer to Australia than the previous search zone, saw several other objects. \n \n The three objects spotted by the Chinese plane were white, red and orange in color, the Xinhua report said. The missing Boeing 777's exterior was red, white, blue and gray. \n \n Investigators have been puzzled over what happened to Flight 370, with speculation ranging from equipment failure and a botched hijacking to terrorism or an act by one of the pilots. \n \n The latter was fueled by reports that the pilot's home flight simulator had files deleted from it, but Malaysian Defense Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said checks, including one by the FBI, had turned up no new information. \n \n \"What I know is that there is nothing sinister from the simulators, but of course that will have to be confirmed by the chief of police,\" he said. \n \n Newly analyzed satellite data shifted the search zone on Friday, raising expectations that searchers may be closer to getting physical evidence that the plane crashed into the Indian Ocean. \n \n That would also help narrow the hunt for the wreckage and the plane's black boxes, which could contain clues to what caused the plane to be so far off-course. \n \n The U.S. Navy has already sent equipment that can detect pings from the back boxes, and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott told reporters in Sydney that the equipment would be put on an Australian naval ship soon. \n \n \"It will be taken to the most prospective search area and if there is good reason to deploy it, it will be deployed,\" he said, without giving a time frame. Other officials have said it could take days for the ship \u2014 the Ocean Shield \u2014 to reach the search area. \n \n The newly targeted zone is nearly 1,130 kilometers (700 miles) northeast of sites the searchers have crisscrossed for the past week. The redeployment came after analysts determined that the Boeing 777 may have been traveling faster than earlier estimates and would therefore have run out of fuel sooner. \n \n The new search area is closer to the southwestern Australian city of Perth than the previous one, with a flying time of 2 1/2 hours each way, allowing for five hours of search time, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. \n \n Malaysia Airlines' commercial director, Hugh Dunleavy, said in Beijing late Saturday that around 40 to 45 Chinese relatives of passengers on the missing plane would fly to Kuala Lumpur early Sunday morning. \n \n Steve Wang, a representative of some of the Chinese families in Beijing, said the relatives wanted to go to Malaysia to seek more answers because they have been unsatisfied by the responses provided by Malaysian government representatives who have met them in China. \n \n \"We have demanded that we meet with the prime minister and the transportation minister,\" said Wang Chunjiang, whose younger brother, lawyer Wang Chunyong, was on Flight 370. \"We have questions that we would like to ask them in person.\" \n \n If investigators can determine that the plane went down in the newly targeted search zone \u2014 which spans about 319,000 square kilometers (123,000 square miles) \u2014 recovery of its flight data and cockpit voice recorders could be complicated. \n \n Much of the sea floor in the area is about 2,000 meters (6,600 feet) below the surface, but depths may reach a maximum of up to 6,000 meters (19,685 feet). \n \n The hunt for the plane focused first on the Gulf of Thailand, along the plane's planned path. But when radar data showed it had veered sharply west, the search moved to the Andaman Sea, off the western coast of Malaysia, before pivoting to the southern Indian Ocean, southwest of Australia. \n \n ___ \n \n Wong reported from Kuala Lumpur. Associated Press writers Scott McDonald and Eileen Ng in Kuala Lumpur; Kristen Gelineau in Sydney; Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia; Nick Perry in Wellington, New Zealand; and Aritz Parra and Didi Tang in Beijing contributed to this report. ||||| The crucial data preserved in the so-called black boxes of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 should survive for two years or longer, even if they are submerged in the corrosive salt water of the Indian Ocean. \n \n If the black boxes \u2014 a cockpit voice recorder that captures the last two hours of the flight, and a data recorder that captures 25 hours \u2014 are recovered, technicians can put them in desalinated water to clean out the memory boards, then vacuum-dry them. \n \n The recorders can survive salt water immersion up to 20,000 feet, Joe Kolly, director of research and engineering for the National Transportation Safety Board, told reporters Friday.

    "document": "CLOSE Arizona Republic columnist E.J. Montini on one size fits all policies that can lead to a Kindergartener being referred for sexual misconduct after pulling his pants down on a playground. The Republic \n \n Stack of school books and apple on desk in empty classroom. (Photo: Getty Images) Story Highlights A kindergartner was given a referral for sexual misconduct after pulling his pants down on the playground. \n \n Experts say young children may not understand the infraction terminology. \n \n Districts say uniform discipline policies help keep things consistent, but allow flexibility to handle individual cases. \n \n An angry Surprise mother has raised questions about discipline appropriate for young children after a school gave her kindergarten son a sexual-misconduct referral when he pulled his pants down on the playground. \n \n The mother said that her son is too young to understand what sexual misconduct means and that he pulled down his pants, exposing himself, not out of sexual intent but because he was intimidated by another student. \n \n She said her son was asked to sign the referral form, which was to stay in his student record while he is a student in the Dysart Unified School District. The boy was given a one-day lunch detention, the mother said. \n \n Dysart Assistant Superintendent Jim Dean said that administrators followed policy, which categorizes the act of pulling one's pants down as sexual misconduct, and that the boy's signature was not an admission of guilt but an acknowledgment that he had received due process. \n \n ROBERTS: Kindergartner is a sex offender? Really? \n \n An attorney for the boy's mother said he later worked out a confidential agreement with the district that removed the sexual-misconduct categorization from the boy's record. \n \n Tashia Abry, assistant research professor at Arizona State University's T. Denny Sanford School of Social and Family Dynamics, said the incident raises serious questions. \n \n \"Is it really fair to characterize this behavior in this context, in this circumstance, as sexual misconduct?\" Abry said. \"That's a question worth asking and that we should be asking ourselves, because this is a child's school record, and it's not something to be taken lightly.\" \n \n The question is difficult for experts to answer. \n \n Though clearly defined codes of conduct and consequences are important, many younger children, especially kindergartners, may not understand, said Mary Anne Duggan, an assistant research professor at the School of Social and Family Dynamics. \n \n \"Children live in a very concrete world at that age,\" Duggan said. \"I don't know how much they could understand of any of that.\" \n \n A label could be detrimental to a child who still is developing a sense of self, because the child could internalize it, Duggan said. \n \n Instead, administrators should focus on the behavior when talking with a child to help the child understand that the action was bad, but that it doesn't make the child bad. \n \n \"Kids do things, and they just need (to be) put back on the right path ... rather than adults using adult words with kids that don't even really apply,\" Duggan said. \n \n School districts are required to report certain behavior infractions, as defined by state and federal standards, to the Arizona Department of Education, including indecent exposure or public sexual indecency. For indecent exposure, the standard stipulates the person is \"reckless\" about whether the other person present would be offended or alarmed. \n \n There were 535 such reported incidents in the 2010-11 school year, 624 in 2011-12 and 717 in 2012-13, according to department data. But after receiving a call from a parent who said her 5-year-old was disciplined for indecent exposure, officials are concerned those numbers are overstated. \n \n \"It appears that, like the parent that called us, there could be other situations where young children were given a violation of indecent exposure, (but) when you read this definition, it's really not possible,\" said Jean Ajamie, Education Department director of school safety and prevention. \n \n The department plans to analyze the data and determine whether training is necessary to educate schools on how to properly report incidents in accordance with the state and federal standards, she said. \n \n Districts have the authority to expand a violation definition in their policies and impose discipline as they see fit, but following state standards when reporting data to the state is paramount to compiling uniform data, Ajamie said. \n \n When it comes to discipline, Abry said, clearly defined policies help teachers and administrators enforce rules more readily because there is a prescribed course for them to follow. \n \n \"It can promote consistency and transparency,\" she said. \n \n Most Valley districts have such policies. The policies have a discipline matrix that defines the various behavior-infraction categories and outlines a range of consequences. The policies vary in the number of infraction categories, specific definitions, range of consequences and how they are applied across grades. \n \n Several districts have \"sexual misconduct\" or \"sexual offenses\" categories that include public display of affection, indecent exposure, sexual abuse and sexual conduct with a minor. Others have separate categories for specific sexual offenses. \n \n Dysart's policy is uniform for all students to ensure that expectations are clear to parents and students and ensure a safe environment, Dean said. \n \n \"There are standards of conduct that are inappropriate on a school campus regardless of the grade level of the student,\" he said. \"Exposing oneself is never going to be appropriate in any school situation.\" \n \n Despite the uniformity, Dean said, administrators thoroughly investigate each incident and consider individual circumstances, including age, before making discipline decisions. \n \n Depending on the district, consequences for an infraction in one of the sexual categories could range from a conference with the student to short-term suspension and up to expulsion for more serious infractions. \n \n A range of consequences adds to the flexibility administrators have to handle each incident, said Helen Hollands, a Mesa Public Schools spokeswoman. \n \n That flexibility is key with younger students, because they often make mistakes, said Jim Cummings, a Glendale Elementary School District spokesman. \n \n \"They're kids, and they need to learn,\" he said, \"and when they do make mistakes, you can use those as teaching moments to teach them the difference between right and wrong, to teach them good behavior from bad behavior.\" \n \n Uniform discipline policies stem from the rise of zero-tolerance policies in the 1990s, said Doug Ward, director of the public-safety leadership division at Johns Hopkins University's School of Education. \n \n Those policies originally focused on drugs, alcohol and weapons in schools as people became more fearful of crime in the 1980s and '90s, but schools soon started including other behaviors, including bullying and sexual harassment, he said. \n \n Child sexual-abuse scandals with organizations like the Boy Scouts of America and the Catholic Church also fueled fear and prompted the criminal-justice system to implement tougher penalties for sex crimes, Ward said. Schools, which reflect society, soon followed suit. \n \n \"People felt the need to protect children even more,\" Ward said. \"A lot of laws were enacted, and I think schools responded with a zero tolerance of sexual crimes and activities.\" \n \n Although people convicted of sexual crimes are required to register as sex offenders and often carry the societal stigma that comes with it, Ward said, students who are disciplined for sexual infractions likely will not face the same stigma, because school records are protected. \n \n Top 10 discipline infractions statewide \n \n School districts are required to report certain behavior infractions to the Arizona Department of Education. Here are the top 10 most commonly reported* infractions across the state during the 2010-11 through 2012-13 school years. \n \n 10. Non-sexual harassment, 6,184. \n \n 9.

Mary Kay Letourneau Fualaau is the former Seattle-area sixth-grade teacher who, at the age of 34, had an affair with her 13-year-old student, Vili Fualaau, and served seven and a half years for their inappropriate relationship. In the candid interview, Mary Kay tells Walters what makes their marriage work in spite of their huge difference in their age. She also discusses her surprising plans to teach again, as well as her intentions to have her status as a registered sex offender lifted. Vili Fualaau, meanwhile, discusses his bouts with alcoholism, depression and why he believes the system failed him while he was still a minor. \n \n Also, for the first time ever, viewers will meet their two teenage daughters, Audrey and Georgia, who are now older than Vili was when he conceived them. The interview airs on \u201c20/20\u201d on FRIDAY, APRIL 10, 2015 (10:00 \u2013 11:00 pm ET) on the ABC TELEVISION NETWORK. \n \n Letourneau first spoke to Walters in 2004 after being released from prison. At that time, she said that she wanted to marry her former student, who was 13 when their liaison began. \u201cWe\u2019ve always planned that and it hasn\u2019t changed,\u201d she told Walters.",

That would be Mary Kay Letourneau and husband Vili Fualaau, whose interview with Barbara Walters airs on ABC tomorrow night. Letourneau is 53 and Fualaau 31, but their relationship made national headlines when Letourneau became pregnant with Fualaau's child when he was all of 13. She had been his sixth-grade teacher. Letourneau spent nearly eight years in jail, but the couple stayed together and now have two teenage daughters, Audrey and Georgia. ABC is providing a few teasers, including the nugget that Letourneau wants to teach again, presumably only after getting her status as a sex offender lifted. Fualaau, meanwhile, will discuss his struggles with alcoholism and depression, notes Us Weekly. \"It was a huge change in my life, for sure,\" Fualaau recalls of the scandal. \"I don't feel like I had the right support or the right help behind me ... from my family, from anyone in general. I mean, my friends couldn't help me because they had no idea what, what it was like to be a parent, I mean, because we were all 14, 15.\" Letourneau says they did the interview in part because they figured they'd be deluged with attention ahead of their May 20 anniversary, like it or not. \"So it's about doing the most responsible thing to protect our girls for the inevitable.\"",

USA TODAY NETWORK \n \n Why you should vote for me. \n \n Hillary Clinton campaigns Nov. 6, 2016, in Cleveland. (Photo: Brendan Smialowski, AFP/Getty Images) \n \n In January, America is going to have a new president. Things are going to change \u2014 that much is certain. The question is, what kind of change are we going to have? \n \n We can build an economy that works for everyone, or stack the deck even more for those at the top. \n \n We can keep America safe through strength and smarts \u2014 or turn our backs on our allies, and cozy up to our adversaries. \n \n We can come together to build a stronger, fairer America, or fear the future and fear each other. \n \n Everything I\u2019ve done, as first lady, senator, or secretary of State, I\u2019ve done by listening to people and looking for common ground, even with people who disagree with me. And if you elect me on Tuesday, that\u2019s the kind of president I\u2019ll be. \n \n Here are four priorities for my first 100 days \u2014 issues I\u2019ve heard about from Americans all over our country. \n \n First, we will put forward the biggest investment in new jobs since World War II. We\u2019ll invest in infrastructure and manufacturing to grow our economy for years to come. We\u2019ll produce enough renewable energy to power every home in America within a decade. We\u2019ll cut red tape for small businesses and make it easier for entrepreneurs to get the credit they need to grow and hire \u2014 because in America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it. We\u2019ll pay for it all by asking the wealthy, Wall Street and big corporations to finally pay their fair share. And this commitment will go far beyond the first 100 days. Creating more good jobs with rising incomes will be a central mission of my presidency. \n \n Second, we will introduce comprehensive immigration reform legislation. The last president to sign comprehensive immigration reform was Ronald Reagan, and it was a priority for George W. Bush. I\u2019m confident that we can work across the aisle to pass comprehensive reform that keeps families together and creates a path to citizenship, secures our border, and focuses our enforcement resources on violent criminals. This is the right thing to do, and it will also grow our economy. \n \n Third, to break the gridlock in Washington, we need to get secret, unaccountable money out of our politics. It\u2019s drowning out the voices of the American people. So within my first 30 days, I will introduce a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. We should be protecting citizens\u2019 rights to vote, not corporations\u2019 rights to buy elections. \n \n Fourth, we need to get started on end-to-end criminal justice reform. Too many people have been sent away for far too long for non-violent offenses. I believe our country will be stronger and safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law. \n \n There\u2019s so much more we need to do together, and we certainly won\u2019t get it all done in the first 100 days. But we\u2019re going to roll up our sleeves and get to work for American families \u2014 and I\u2019ll never, ever quit. \n \n I want to be president for all Americans \u2014 Democrats, Republicans and independents; Americans of every race, faith and background. \n \n My opponent has run his campaign on divisiveness, fear and insults, and spent months pitting Americans against each other. I\u2019ve said many times that Donald Trump has shown us who he is. Now we have to decide who we are. \n \n Because it\u2019s not just our names on the ballot this year. Every issue we care about is on the ballot, too. This is about who we are as a country \u2014 and whether we are going to have change that makes us stronger together, or change that pushes us further apart. \n \n It all comes down to this. I love our country. I believe in our people. And I think there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t achieve if we work together and invest in each other. \n \n Hillary Clinton is the Democratic nominee for president. \n \n You can read diverse opinions from our Board of Contributors and other writers on the Opinion front page, on Twitter @USATOpinion and in our daily Opinion newsletter.

Do not phone for help or try to retrieve possessions. There is very little time. \n \n Open the windows straightaway before contact with water makes the electric system fail or water pressure stops you winding the windows down. \n \n If that doesn't work, get the door open, undo your seatbelt and get out. \n \n The third option, in last resort, is to pull a headrest out and use the metal part of it to hit the window, hard, in the corner and hopefully break it open. \n \n If you are underwater when you leave the car, push away from it, and if you don't know for sure which way is up, check what direction bubbles are floating in and swim that way. \n \n sources: Popular Mechanics, The Art of Manliness and Top Gear",

All three cities lie close to Ukraine's border with Russia. \n \n Interior Minister Arsen Avakov vowed to restore order in eastern Ukraine without using violence and also accused Ukraine's ousted president Viktor Yanukovich, whose political base was in Donetsk, of conspiring with Putin to fuel tensions. \n \n \"Putin and Yanukovich ordered and paid for the latest wave of separatist disorder in the east of the country. The people who have gathered are not many but they are very aggressive,\" Avakov said in a statement on his Facebook page. \n \n \"The situation will come back under control without bloodshed. That is the order to law enforcement officers, it's true. But the truth is that no one will peacefully tolerate the lawlessness of provocateurs.\" \n \n Acting President Oleksander Turchinov called an emergency meeting of security chiefs in Kiev and took personal control of the situation, the parliamentary press service said. \n \n Mainly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine has seen a sharp rise in tensions since Yanukovich's overthrow in February and the advent of an interim government in Kiev that backs closer ties with the European Union. \n \n Russia has branded the new government illegitimate and has annexed Ukraine's Crimea region, citing threats to its Russian-speaking majority - a move that has sparked the biggest standoff between Moscow and the West since the end of the Cold War. \n \n REFERENDUM DEMAND \n \n Around 1,500 people protested in Donetsk on Sunday before breaking into the regional administration building, where they hung a Russian flag from a second-floor balcony, a Reuters witness said. Protesters outside cheered and chanted \"Russia! Russia!\". \n \n In the Luhansk protest, Ukrainian television said three people had been injured. Police could not confirm the report. \n \n Talking to the crowd over a loudspeaker, protest leaders in Donetsk said they wanted regional lawmakers to convene an emergency meeting to discuss a vote on joining Russia like the one in Ukraine's Crimea region that led to its annexation. \n \n \"Deputies of the regional council should convene before midnight and take the decision to carry out a referendum,\" one of the protest leaders said, without identifying himself. \n \n A local Internet portal streamed footage from the seized building, showing people entering and exiting freely.

Nine people had been hurt in the disturbances in Luhansk. \n \n Mainly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine has seen a sharp rise in tension since Moscow-backed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich\u2019s overthrow in February and the advent of an interim government in Kiev that wants closer ties with Europe. \n \n Russia has branded the new leadership in Kiev illegitimate and has annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimea region, citing threats to its Russian-speaking majority - a move that caused the biggest standoff between Moscow and the West since the end of the Cold War. \n \n YANUKOVICH CALL \n \n The protesters appeared to be responding in part to Yanukovich, who fled to Russia after he was ousted and who on March 28 issued a public call for each of Ukraine\u2019s regions to hold a referendum on its status inside the country. \n \n A pro-Russian protester stands inside the seized regional administrative building in Kharkiv April 6, 2014.

It was not clear why the Russian marine had opened fire. \n \n Yatseniuk said that though much of the unrest had died down in eastern Ukraine in the past month there remained about 1,500 \u201cradicals\u201d in each region who spoke with \u201cclear Russian accents\u201d and whose activity was being coordinated through foreign intelligence services. \n \n But he said Ukrainian authorities had drawn up a plan to handle the crisis. \n \n \u201cWe have a clear action plan,\u201d he said, adding that senior officials would head to the towns concerned. \n \n Avakov on Sunday accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of orchestrating the \u201cseparatist disorder\u201d and promised that disturbances would be brought under control without violence. \n \n Russia has been pushing internationally a plan proposing the \u201cfederalization\u201d of Ukraine in which regions of the country of 46 million would have broad powers of autonomy. \n \n Slideshow (9 Images) \n \n Ukraine, while drawing up its own blueprint of constitutional changes for \u2018de-centralization\u2019 in which smaller municipalities would be able to develop their own areas by retaining a portion of state taxes raised, says the Russian plan is aimed at breaking up the country. \n \n Referring to the Russian plan, Yatseniuk said: \u201cIt is an attempt to destroy Ukrainian statehood, a script which has been written in the Russian Federation, the aim of which is to divide and destroy Ukraine and turn part of Ukraine into a slave territory under the dictatorship of Russia,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cThis is not going to happen,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cI appeal to the people and the elites of the east.

About half of the region's residents are ethnic Russians, many of whom believe Ukraine's acting authorities are Ukrainian nationalists who will oppress Russians. Ukraine's interim authorities deny they are infringing the rights of the ethnic Russian population. \n \n Since Crimea held a secession referendum and then was annexed by Russia in March, calls for similar votes in Ukraine's east have emerged. ||||| Gallery 12 photo Gallery \u00a9 EPA/ROMAN PILIPEY Situation in Donetsk \n \n KIEV, April 7. /ITAR-TASS/. The council of recently proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic turned to the Russian president, asking him to introduce a temporary peacekeeping contingent. \n \n The lawmakers unanimously supported the address of the Republican Council of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic. \n \n Earlier, the deputies of the Donetsk regional council proclaimed the state sovereignty of the Donetsk People\u2019s Republic. The corresponding bill was read at the council\u2019s session. \n \n \u201cThe territory of the republic within the recognized borders is indivisible and inviolable,\u201d the council said. The legislators also passed a decision on holding a referendum on whether or not the region should join the Russian Federation. It will be held no later than May 11. \n \n On this background, residents of the city of Donetsk were holding an action of protest in front of the building of the Regional State Administration. The gathering was chanting \u2018Russia, Russia!\u2019 and waving the Russian flags. \n \n In the meantime, a Russian tricolor that was hoisted on a mast in front of the building Sunday has been replaced with a larger one. \n \n Mass meetings in support of Ukraine\u2019s transformation into a federation were held under Russian flags in Kharkiv, Luhansk and Donetsk Sunday. \n \n The Russian tricolor standard was installed on the building of the Kharkiv Region administration Monday. Prior to the action, the demonstrators removed the Ukrainian national flag from the roof. \n \n In Donetsk, the protesters seized the building of the regional administration and the regional branch of Ukraine\u2019s Security Service. \n \n 00:00 / 00:40 SD HD Share \n \n On Monday, supporters of turning the country into a federation put up barricades in front of the entrance to the Kharkiv Region administration. They used automobile tires among other \u2018construction materials\u2019. \n \n In Luhansk, unidentified people who had entrenched themselves in the building of the Security Service\u2019s regional branch seized the room where service guns were kept. \n \n On using Russian Armed Forces on the territory of Ukraine \n \n March 1, 2014, Russia\u2019s Federation Council gave its consent to the president for using the armed forces on the territory of Ukraine. The relevant decision was unanimously adopted by the upper house of Russian parliament at an extraordinary session. Earlier, Vladimir Putin submitted to the Federation Council an address on using the armed forces of Russia on the territory of Ukraine until the normalization of the socio-political situation in that country. This initiative was proposed with regard to a plea by Ukraine\u2019s legitimate president Viktor Yanukovych. \n \n Later the Ukrainian leader said that the address to Vladimir Putin regarding the use of armed forces was triggered by the bout of armed delinquency in Ukraine. \u201cI\u2019ve done it for a reason, because I became target of the criminals. Armed gangs started to cruise around the country. In particular, they pursued me on the territory of Ukraine,\u201d he said. ||||| MOSCOW \u2014 Under the attentive eye of Russian state television, several hundred pro-Russian demonstrators in the city of Donetsk, in eastern Ukraine, declared on Monday that they were forming an independent republic and urged President Vladimir V. Putin to send troops to the region as a peacekeeping force, even though there was no imminent threat to peace. \n \n The actions in Donetsk and two other main cities in eastern Ukraine, which included demands for a referendum on seceding from Ukraine and joining Russia, seemed an effort by the activists to mimic some of the events that preceded Russia\u2019s invasion and annexation of Crimea. However, there were no immediate indications that the Kremlin was receptive to the pleas. \n \n While widely regarded as political theater supported if not directed by the Kremlin, the protests could help promote what analysts say is Russia\u2019s primary goal of destabilizing the shaky government in Kiev, preventing it from drifting further into the West\u2019s orbit and giving Moscow leverage over the country\u2019s future ahead of presidential elections in May. \n \n The turmoil in eastern Ukraine also makes it extremely difficult for the provisional government in Kiev to begin putting in place an array of austerity measures and financial overhauls required by the International Monetary Fund as a condition for an $18 billion loan package that the country desperately needs to avert a financial default.",

Maybe the mass-murderer was so used to his many wives that his fantasy was to escape to a world of plain, vanilla monogamous sex. \n \n Unfortunately we may never know. Despite a Freedom of Information Act request, those buzzkills over at the CIA have made sure that we won\u2019t be finding out anytime soon what sort of shit the former Al Qaeda leader liked to jerk it to while he hid away in his secret Abbottabad compound. \n \n If you don\u2019t have a Google Alerts set for \u201c\u2018Osama bin Laden\u2019 AND \u2018porn,'\u201d then you might not be aware that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper confirmed last month that a collection of pornography had been recovered in the raid on bin Laden\u2019s hideout that resulted in the terrorist leader\u2019s death. Clapper also confirmed that while many of the documents found in the raid would be declassified, bin Laden\u2019s skin mags would remain under wraps. \n \n But staffers at BroBible knew enough about pr0n to realize that, just as a fine musical instrument is meant to be played, dirty mags are meant to be shared with the world \u2014 shared until their tattered, jizz-ridden pages no longer have any structural integrity and disintegrate like so many tissues in toilet paper commercials. \n \n So BroBible\u2019s David Covucci did what any intrepid young reporter would do: He filed a FOIA request. The letter he sent to the CIA is as follows: \n \n We at the men\u2019s general interest publication BroBible dot com (one of the nation\u2019s largest websites for men), would like to know what pornographic materials Osama Bin Laden had in his possession at the time of his death. We are adults. We can handle it. We would like to know what kind of porn the world\u2019s most wanted man jerked it to. Does being under the constant threat of capture require extra stimulation? I imagine it would be hard for him to focus on his dick, so I figure he had to watch some really nasty shit. \n \n On Thursday afternoon, Covucci received word back from the CIA, but disappointingly the spy agency said they would not be honoring his request: \n \n With regard to the pornographic material Osama Bin Laden had in his possession at the time of his death, responsive records, should they exist, would be contained in the operational files. The CIA Information Act, 50 U.S.C 431, as amended, exempts CIA operational files from search, review, publication, and disclosure requirements of the FOIA. To the extent that this material exists, the CIA would be prohibited by 18 USC Section 1461 from mailing obscene matter. \n \n As pointed out at the 11-minute mark of the May 22 Slate Political Gabfest, it seems odd that the government wouldn\u2019t want to release the information \u2014 as it would be potentially very embarrassing for Al Qaeda. For whatever reason, though, it looks like the CIA is taking the high road. \n \n I gotta say, when it comes to picking issues to develop a moral backbone over, the CIA sure knows how to pick \u2018em.

Reuters reported that officials were unsure about the precise location where the material was found or who might have been viewing it. \n \n What we do know, courtesy of the news service, is that the stash consisted of \u201cmodern electronically recorded video,\u201d which means that the Internet-deprived terrorist was basically resigned to watching pornography on VHS like a teenage boy in 1987. \n \n Is there any worse punishment, really? \n \n In hopes of uncovering the terrorist leader\u2019s pornographic predilections, a determined bro named David Covucci decided to send the CIA a FOIA request on behalf of the esteemed online periodical of jockish 20-somethings known as BroBible. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m a man,\u201d Covucci wrote last month, articulating his insatiable need to uncover the truth. \u201cI can handle knowing what kind of porn Osama bin Laden watched.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 What kind of porn might be classified? The stuff watched by Osama bin Laden. A blogger at the men's website BroBible filed a, er, colorful Freedom of Information Act request with the CIA to get the details on the \"pornographic material\" found among bin Laden's stuff. (The request is here, and the language is a little graphic.) David Covucci got his formal answer this week from the spy agency: No dice. \u201cWith regard to the pornographic material Osama bin Laden had in his possession at the time of his death, responsive records, should they exist, would be contained in operational files,\u201d and such files are exempt from FOIA requests, says the letter. Even if they weren't in the operational files, it seems that Covucci would have been out of luck: \"To the extent that this material exists, the CIA would be prohibited by 18 USC Section 1461 from mailing obscene matter,\" adds the letter. Intelligence chief James Clapper confirmed the porn's existence last month, notes Death and Taxes, which finds it odd that the agency is keeping it wraps given the potential for embarrassment to al-Qaeda. Maybe it's a job for WikiLeaks, suggests Reason. And as for Covucci, \"hold your head up, bro,\" writes Peter Holley at the Washington Post. \"Now you\u2019ve got a cool letter you can frame.\"",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Did Osama bin Laden have a foot fetish? Or was he into cake farts? Maybe the mass-murderer was so used to his many wives that his fantasy was to escape to a world of plain, vanilla monogamous sex. Despite a Freedom of Information Act request, those buzzkills over at the CIA have made sure that we won\u2019t be finding out anytime soon what sort of shit the former al-Qaeda leader liked to jerk it to while he hid away in his secret Abbottabad compound. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper confirmed last month that a collection of pornography had been recovered in the raid on bin Laden's hideout that resulted in the terrorist leader's death. Clapper also confirmed that while many of the documents found in the raid would be declassified, bin Laden's skin mags would remain under wraps. But staffers at BroBible knew enough about pr0n to realize that, just as a fine musical instrument is meant to be played, dirty mags are meant to be shared with the world\u2014shared until their tattered, jizz-ridden pages no longer have any structural integrity and disintegrate like so many tissues in toilet paper commercials. So BroBible's David Covucci did what any intrepid young reporter would do: He filed a FOIA request. The letter he sent to the CIA is as follows: \"We at the men\u2019s general interest publication BroBible dot com (one of the nation\u2019s largest websites for men) would like to know what pornographic materials Osama bin Laden had in his possession at the time of his death.\" On Thursday, the CIA responded, \"With regard to the porn found in bin Laden's collection, the only one of which the collection was one, which was one of which the only the one's one, which, which which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which, which ...

    "document": "Craig\u2019s first major break in the case came in September 2009. With the help of some industry experts, he identified a New York\u2013based server that seemed to play some sort of role in the Zeus network. He obtained a search warrant, and an FBI forensics team copied the server\u2019s data onto a hard drive, then overnighted it to Nebraska. When an engineer in Omaha examined the results, he sat in awe for a moment. The hard drive contained tens of thousands of lines of instant message chat logs in Russian and Ukrainian. Looking over at Craig, the engineer said: \u201cYou have their Jabber server.\u201d \n \n This was the gang\u2019s whole digital operation\u2014a road map to the entire case. The cybersecurity firm Mandiant dispatched an engineer to Omaha for months just to help untangle the Jabber Zeus code, while the FBI began cycling in agents from other regions on 30- or 90-day assignments. Linguists across the country pitched in to decipher the logs. \u201cThe slang was a challenge,\u201d Craig says. \n \n One woman explained that she\u2019d become a money mule after a job at a grocery store fell through, telling an agent: \u201cI could strip, or I could do this.\u201d \n \n The messages contained references to hundreds of victims, their stolen credentials scattered in English throughout the files. Craig and other agents started cold-calling institutions, telling them they had been hit by cyberfraud. He found that several businesses had terminated employees they suspected of the thefts\u2014not realizing that the individuals\u2019 computers had been infected by malware and their logins stolen. \n \n The case also expanded beyond the virtual world. In New York one day in 2009, three young women from Kazakhstan walked into the FBI field office there with a strange story. The women had come to the States to look for work and found themselves participating in a curious scheme: A man would drive them to a local bank and tell them to go inside and open a new account. They were to explain to the teller that they were students visiting for the summer. A few days later, the man had them return to the bank and withdraw all of the money in the account; they kept a small cut and passed the rest on to him. Agents pieced together that the women were \u201cmoney mules\u201d: Their job was to cash out the funds that Slavik and his comrades had siphoned from legitimate accounts. \n \n By the summer of 2010, New York investigators had put banks across the region on alert for suspicious cash-outs and told them to summon FBI agents as they occurred. The alert turned up dozens of mules withdrawing tens of thousands of dollars. Most were students or newly arrived immigrants in Brighton Beach. One woman explained that she\u2019d become a mule after a job at a grocery store fell through, telling an agent: \u201cI could strip, or I could do this.\u201d Another man explained that he\u2019d be picked up at 9 am, do cash-out runs until 3 pm, and then spend the rest of the day at the beach. Most cash-outs ran around $9,000, just enough to stay under federal reporting limits. The mule would receive 5 to 10 percent of the total, with another cut going to the recruiter. The rest of the money would be sent overseas. \n \n \u201cThe amount of organization these kids\u2014they\u2019re in their twenties\u2014were able to pull together would\u2019ve impressed any Fortune 100 company,\u201d the FBI\u2019s James Craig says. \n \n The United States, moreover, was just one market in what investigators soon realized was a multinational reign of fraud. Officials traced similar mule routes in Romania, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom, Ukraine, and Russia. All told, investigators could attribute around $70 million to $80 million in thefts to the group\u2014but they suspected the total was far more than that. \n \n Banks howled at the FBI to shut the fraud down and stanch the losses. Over the summer, New York agents began to close in on high-ranking recruiters and the scheme\u2019s masterminds in the US. Two Moldovans were arrested at a Milwaukee hotel at 11 pm following a tip; one suspect in Boston tried to flee a raid on his girlfriend\u2019s apartment and had to be rescued from the fire escape. \n \n Meanwhile, Craig\u2019s case in Omaha advanced against the broader Jabber Zeus gang. The FBI and the Justice Department had zeroed in on an area in eastern Ukraine around the city of Donetsk, where several of the Jabber Zeus leaders seemed to live. Alexey Bron, known online as \u201cthehead,\u201d specialized in moving the gang\u2019s money around the world. Ivan Viktorvich Klepikov, who went by the moniker \u201cpetr0vich,\u201d ran the group\u2019s IT management, web hosting, and domain names. And Vyacheslav Igorevich Penchukov, a well-known local DJ who went by the nickname \u201ctank,\u201d managed the whole scheme, putting him second in command to Slavik. \u201cThe amount of organization these kids\u2014they\u2019re in their twenties\u2014were able to pull together would\u2019ve impressed any Fortune 100 company,\u201d Craig says. The gang poured their huge profits into expensive cars (Penchukov had a penchant for high-end BMWs and Porsches, while Klepikov preferred Subaru WRX sports sedans), and the chat logs were filled with discussions of fancy vacations across Turkey, Crimea, and the United Arab Emirates. \n \n By the fall of 2010, the FBI was ready to take down the network. As officials in Washington called a high-profile press conference, Craig found himself on a rickety 12-hour train ride across Ukraine to Donetsk, where he met up with agents from the country\u2019s security service to raid tank\u2019s and petr0\u00advich\u2019s homes. Standing in petr0vich\u2019s living room, a Ukrainian agent told Craig to flash his FBI badge. \u201cShow him it\u2019s not just us,\u201d he urged. Craig was stunned by the scene: The hacker, wearing a purple velvet smoking jacket, seemed unperturbed as agents searched his messy apartment in a Soviet-\u00adstyle concrete building; his wife held their baby in the kitchen, laughing with investigators. \u201cThis is the gang I\u2019ve been chasing?\u201d Craig thought. The raids lasted well into the night, and Craig didn\u2019t return to his hotel until 3 am. He took nearly 20 terabytes of seized data back to Omaha. \n \n With 39 arrests around the world\u2014stretching across four nations\u2014investigators managed to disrupt the network. But crucial players slipped away. One top mule recruiter in the US fled west, staying a step ahead of investigators in Las Vegas and Los Angeles before finally escaping the country inside a shipping container. More important, Slavik, the mastermind himself, remained almost a complete cipher. Investigators assumed he was based in Russia. And once, in an online chat, they saw him reference that he was married. Other than that, they had nothing. The formal indictment referred to the creator of the Zeus malware using his online pseu\u00addo\u00adnym. Craig didn\u2019t even know what his prime suspect looked like. \u201cWe have thousands of photos from tank, petr0\u00advich\u2014not once did we see Slavik\u2019s mug,\u201d Craig says. Soon even the criminal\u2019s online traces vanished. Slavik, whoever he was, went dark. And after seven years of chasing Jabber Zeus, James Craig moved on to other cases. ||||| Bogachev was last known to reside in Anapa, Russia. He is known to enjoy boating and may travel to locations along the Black Sea in his boat. He also owns property in Krasnodar, Russia. \n \n Caution: \n \n Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, using the online monikers \u201clucky12345\u201d and \u201cslavik\u201d, is wanted for his alleged involvement in a wide-ranging racketeering enterprise and scheme that installed, without authorization, malicious software known as \u201cZeus\u201d on victims\u2019 computers. The software was used to capture bank account numbers, passwords, personal identification numbers, and other information necessary to log into online banking accounts. While Bogachev knowingly acted in a role as an administrator, others involved in the scheme conspired to distribute spam and phishing emails, which contained links to compromised web sites. Victims who visited these web sites were infected with the malware, which Bogachev and others utilized to steal money from the victims\u2019 bank accounts. This online account takeover fraud has been investigated by the FBI since the summer of 2009. \n \n Starting in September of 2011, the FBI began investigating a modified version of the Zeus Trojan, known as GameOver Zeus (GOZ). It is believed GOZ is responsible for more than one million computer infections, resulting in financial losses of more than $100 million. \n \n On August 22, 2012, Bogachev was indicted under the nickname \u201clucky12345\u201d by a federal grand jury in the District of Nebraska on charges of Conspiracy to Participate in Racketeering Activity; Bank Fraud; Conspiracy to Violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act; Conspiracy to Violate the Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act; and Aggravated Identity Theft. On May 19, 2014, Bogachev was indicted in his true name by a federal grand jury in the Western District of Pennsylvania on charges of Conspiracy; Computer Fraud; Wire Fraud; Bank Fraud; and Money Laundering. On May 30, 2014, a criminal complaint was issued in the District of Nebraska that ties the previously indicted nickname of \"lucky12345\" to Bogachev and charges him with Conspiracy to Commit Bank Fraud.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev, once described by a cybersecurity expert as the \"most prolific bank robber in the world,\" ended up on a different list altogether in December: as one of the individuals noted in then-President Obama's sanctions against Russia for trying to influence the election. As Garrett M. Graff explains in his Wired piece, Bogachev is an FBI \"most wanted\" poster boy who developed a malware \"masterpiece\" under the screen name \"Slavik,\" known for pulling off extensive financial transgressions around the globe. Now, however, Bogachev has become known as his homeland's \"most notorious hacker,\" and he's still on the loose, despite the US government's multi-year battle to flush him out and haul him in. Graff's article details how Bogachev was constantly able to elude authorities where others couldn't, from the early days of the malware and ransomware projects he ran to the present. It also reveals the FBI's unceasing efforts to take down the botnet-driven schemes, a probe that eventually uncovered Slavik's real identity (Bogachev) and that he'd moved on from banks to government \"espionage commands.\" The FBI finally launched Bogachev's day of reckoning: May 30, 2014, when the feds would take down his whole operation. It was an \"amazing\" day of \"cyber-hand-to-hand combat,\" one witness, a Pittsburgh US attorney, says of the attack, which was a success. Bogachev, however\u2014named on Obama's sanctions list not for election hacking (the US government doesn't think he was) but to pressure Russia to turn him over in \"good faith\"\u2014may never be caught. \"Bogachev and other Russian cybercriminals lie pretty far beyond America's reach,\" Graff laments.

    "document": "James Howells, an IT worker living in the United Kingdom, knows exactly where his misplaced 7,500 bitcoins are but the city council where he lives won't let him retrieve them. They say it's against the law. \n \n According to a report published in The Telegraph, Howells began mining bitcoin on his personal laptop in 2009. In 2013, though, \"after I had stopped mining, the laptop I had used was broken into parts and sold on eBay,\" Howells tells The Telegraph. \n \n He kept the drive he used to collect the bitcoins, \"so if bitcoin did become valuable one day, I would still have the coins I mined.\" \n \n But, while cleaning his home in 2013, he mistakenly put it into a waste bin at his local landfill site in Newport, South Wales, where it got buried. \n \n Now, with bitcoin's value hovering just above $17,000 Wednesday, according to digital-currency website CoinDesk, Howells' 7,500 lost bitcoins are worth more than $127 million. CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index tracks prices from digital currency exchanges Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase and itBit. \n \n More than four years' worth of garbage have poured into the dump since his mistake, which would make any recovery effort a significant undertaking. \"A modern landfill is a complex engineering project and digging one up brings up all sorts of environmental issues, such as dangerous gasses and potential landfill fires,\" Howells says. \"It's a big, expensive and risky project.\" ||||| Newscast/UIG via Getty Images \n \n What does it feel like to lose $75,000,000 in bitcoin? James Howells tries not to let it get to him. And strictly speaking, he knows where his coins are \u2014 they're under 200,000 tonnes of garbage at a landfill in Newport, South Wales. \n \n Back in 2009, Howells set an old laptop to mining bitcoin \u2013 back before you needed specialised hardware \u2013 eventually totting up 7,500 coins. He later broke up the Dell M1710 into parts to sell on eBay, but kept the hard drive tucked away in a drawer in case bitcoin ever did take off. Four years later, he'd forgotten about his horde, and during a clean out, the hard drive was accidentally binned, presumably landing in Newport landfill. \n \n Advertisement \n \n At that time, his bitcoin stash was already worth millions. Thanks to the digital currency's value skyrocketing from between $300 and $1,000 in 2013 to more than $10,000 this week, his pile is now worth $75 million. \n \n Why isn't he frantically digging through refuse? For that matter, why aren't you? The council won't allow it \u2013 it's dangerous and difficult. \"I haven\u2019t actually tried to search for the hard drive yet as I haven\u2019t been given permission to look despite having financial backing in place and engaging the local council a number of times,\" Howells tells me via email. \"Digging up a landfill is not as easy as just digging a hole in the ground.\" It would require diggers, plenty of specialist help, and, Howells says, be the first such excavation that wasn't related to a criminal investigation in the UK \u2013 though such an effort has been done in the US to retrieve dumped ET Atari cartridges. \n \n Read next Another week, another bitcoin hack, another huge price drop Another week, another bitcoin hack, another huge price drop \n \n A spokesperson for Newport City Council said it has been \"contacted in the past about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins\". But the costs of digging up the landfill, and storing and treating the waste, would run into the millions and cause a \"huge environmental impact on the surrounding area\". And there's no guarantee the drive would be found or still work. \n \n The landfill contains around 350,000 tonnes of waste, with 50,000 added annually, the spokesperson said. \"It is likely that the hardware would have suffered significant galvanic corrosion due to the presence of landfill leachates and gases,\" they added. \n \n Millions in costs, dangerous conditions, no promise of a reward... but what a reward if found. Newport City Council has faced budgetary concerns this year \u2013 the head of the council has warned that council tax will increase amid services cuts \u2013 and Howells believes bitcoin will eventually be worth so much they will have no choice but to let him search. \"And obviously they would get a nice percentage as a gift or donation.\" \n \n If this all makes you want to hop a train to Newport with a shovel in hand, be warned that aside from being dangerous, the landfill is not open to the public and \"any potential treasure hunters\" would be committing a criminal offence, the council spokesperson noted. And the effort required to search for the drive means you're sure to be noticed. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Howells still has the public address, so he can check that his coins haven't moved; if you do find the hard drive, note that the data is encrypted, so you'll need his help either way. \"If they ever moved I would know,\" he says. \"It's a little like looking at your bank account containing millions of dollars but not being able to spend it.\" If you doubt his good humour about the whole story, he follows that statement with a \"lol\". \n \n Howells is always aware of the bitcoin price, but not because of his missing treasure. \"I have multiple tickers running with prices in different fiat currencies, but that's not because I\u2019m obsessed with the price because of my lost coins,\" he said. \"I\u2019m still active in the bitcoin space and still involved with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies on a day-to-day basis promoting, tweeting, trading, development, research, learning.\" His interests now lie in Bitcoin Cash, the result of a hard fork in August, and he has plenty more to say about the post-fork discussion and the future of digital currencies than he does the lost coins. \n \n If he had access to his digital fortune, he believes he'd have sold up some of it by now anyway, partially to invest in rival currencies. \"Who knows for sure... honestly I probably would have sold 30 per cent or 40 per cent at around $1,000 in 2013 to invest in property and other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and kept the rest in bitcoin,\" he says. \"I know for sure I would not have sold them all because I believe the bitcoin price will be much higher than $10,000 long term. Even $100,000 is a conservative figure.\" If that ever happens, his missing bitcoin will be worth $750m \u2013 which may well be enough to get Newport Council's attention.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 When covering the story four years ago, Newser's headline read, \"$7.5M Bitcoin Fortune Buried in Landfill.\" That fortune ended up in a Welsh landfill after James Howells threw out a hard drive over that summer while cleaning up his workspace.

With bitcoin valued at roughly $17,000 as of Wednesday, those 7,500 lost bitcoins are worth more than $127 million, reports CNBC. He tells the Telegraph that he hasn't \"sat here crying about it, accidents happen.\" But that hasn't deterred him from hoping he'll one day get to go searching at the Newport landfill, something the Newport City Council currently won't allow. It would be a novel undertaking: \"A landfill has never been excavated in the UK before\" for non-criminal reasons, he says, \"so we\u2019re in uncharted territory with regards to regulations, local authorities and environmental agencies.\" And there are plenty of risks, from deadly gases to the possibility of landfill fires, not to mention the cost. But \"the higher the value goes, the more chance I have to recover it,\" he says. Wired spoke with a rep from the city council, and the upshot isn't too optimistic, with the rep citing the huge costs of doing the excavating and storing the waste, plus the \"huge environmental impact on the surrounding area\"\u2014and after all that, the hard drive might not be found or usable, though Howells has brushed off naysayers who argue the drive would be destroyed by corrosion at this point.

But the city council won't let him search for it. \"Digging up a landfill is not as easy as just digging a hole in the ground,\" Howells says. \"I haven\u2019t actually tried to search for the hard drive yet as I haven\u2019t been given permission to look despite having financial backing in place and engaging the local council a number of times.\" Newport City Council says it has been \"contacted in the past about the possibility of retrieving a piece of IT hardware said to contain bitcoins,\" but \"the costs of digging up the landfill, and storing and treating the waste, would run into the millions and cause a huge environmental impact on the surrounding area.\" \"It is likely that the hardware would have suffered significant galvanic corrosion due to the presence of landfill leachates and gases,\" the council says. \"It's a little like looking at your bank account containing millions of dollars.\" Howells says he has the public address, so he can check if the hard drive hasn't moved. \"if it hasn't moved, and if it hasn't moved, or if it hasn't moved, or if it hasn't been found. \"I'll be able to find anything to find any opportunity to find any opportunity to find a search to find a search to find a find a search to find a search to find a search to find a search to find a search to find a search to find a find a chance to find a ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...

(Associated Press) \n \n Michael Clarke Duncan was one big, irresistible jumble of contradictions. \n \n His presence was formidable, even intimidating: The former bodyguard had a muscular, 6-foot-4 frame, but it was topped by the brightest of megawatt smiles. \n \n His gravelly baritone was well-suited to everything from animated films to action spectacles, but no matter the role, a warmth and a sweetness was always evident underneath. \n \n The prolific character actor, whose dozens of movies included an Oscar-nominated performance as a death row inmate in \"The Green Mile\" and box office hits including \"Armageddon,\" `'Planet of the Apes\" and \"Kung Fu Panda,\" died Monday at age 54. And although he only turned to acting in his 30s, it's clear from the outpouring of prayers and remembrances he received across the Hollywood and sports worlds that his gentle-giant persona made him much-loved during that relatively brief time. \n \n Duncan died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he was being treated for a heart attack, said his fianc??e, Omarosa Manigault, in a statement released by publicist Joy Fehily. \n \n Duncan \"suffered a myocardial infarction on July 13 and never fully recovered,\" the statement said. \"Manigault is grateful for all of your prayers and asks for privacy at this time. Celebrations of his life, both private and public, will be announced at a later date.\" \n \n Tom Hanks, star of 1999's \"The Green Mile\" _ the film that earned a then-little-known Duncan a supporting-actor nomination at the Academy Awards _ said he was \"terribly saddened at the loss of Big Mike. He was the treasure we all discovered on the set of `The Green Mile.' He was magic. He was a big love of man and his passing leaves us stunned.\" \n \n \"I will miss my friend, Michael Clarke Duncan,\" comedian and talk-show host Steve Harvey said on Twitter. \"What an incredible soldier in God's Plan.\" Other sad and shocked reactions came from a diverse field that included Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner Mark Cuban, actresses Alexa Vega, Niecy Nash and Olivia Munn, and former boxing champion Lennox Lewis. \n \n In the spring of 2012, Duncan had appeared in a video for PETA, the animal rights organization, in which he spoke of how much better he felt since becoming a vegetarian three years earlier. \n \n \"I cleared out my refrigerator, about $5,000 worth of meat,\" he said. \"I'm a lot healthier than I was when I was eating meat.\" \n \n Duncan had a handful of minor roles before \"The Green Mile\" brought him accolades and fame. The 1999 film, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, starred Hanks as a corrections officer at a penitentiary in the 1930s. Duncan played John Coffey, a convicted murderer with a surprisingly gentle demeanor and extraordinary healing powers. \n \n Duncan's performance caught on with critics and moviegoers and he quickly became a favorite in Hollywood, appearing in several films a year. He owed some of his good fortune to Bruce Willis, who recommended Duncan for \"The Green Mile\" after the two appeared together in \"Armageddon.\" Duncan would work with Willis again in \"Breakfast of Champions,\" `'The Whole Nine Yards\" and \"Sin City.\" \n \n His industrial-sized build was suited for everything from superhero films (\"Daredevil\") to comedy (\"Talladega Nights,\" `'School for Scoundrels\"). He could have made a career out of his voice work alone, with appearances in several animated and family movies, including, \"Kung Fu Panda,\" `'Racing Stripes\" and \"Brother Bear.\" Among Duncan's television credits were \"The Apprentice,\" `'Two and a Half Men,\" `'The Suite Life of Zack and Cody\" and a new series, \"The Finder.\" \n \n Born in Chicago in 1957, Duncan was raised by a single mother whose resistance to his playing football led to his deciding he wanted to become an actor. But when his mother became ill, he dropped out of college, Alcorn State University, and worked as a ditch digger and bouncer to support her. By his mid-20s, he was in Los Angeles, where he looked for acting parts and became a bodyguard for Will Smith, Jamie Foxx and other stars. The murder of rapper Notorious B.I.G., for whom Duncan had been hired to protect before switching assignments, led him to quit his job and pursue acting full-time. \n \n Early film and television credits, when he was usually cast as a bodyguard or bouncer, included \"Bulworth,\" `'A Night at the Roxbury\" and \"The Players Club.\" \n \n ___ \n \n AP Writers Steve Loeper and Hillel Italie contributed to this report.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The heart attack that ultimately killed Michael Clarke Duncan happened in July, the AP reports.

Duncan was still being treated at LA's Cedars-Sinai Medical Center when he died yesterday. The AP notes that Duncan became a vegetarian three years ago, and just this spring did a video for PETA saying he was \"a lot healthier\" since giving up meat. Duncan and Manigault were planning to wed in January, reports TMZ. Wedding preparations had just begun when Duncan went into full cardiac arrest. Though doctors were flown in to help him, he never left the hospital. Tributes to the actor are rolling in from all corners of Hollywood, but one of the most touching comes from Tom Hanks, Duncan's co-star in The Green Mile. \"I am terribly saddened at the loss of Big Mike,\" Hanks tells Entertainment Tonight. \"He was the treasure we all discovered on the set of The Green Mile.

    "document": "Hewlett-Packard's Mark Hurd didn't sit down for an interview with me, but he's begun doing phoners post-earnings and I'm still holding out hope that 2010 will be the year for a two-camera, in-depth production. Come on, Mr. Hurd. Now's a good time! \n \n I predicted that Google would come up with new revenue streams, and with YouTube turning a profit and Android looking good, that prediction came true too, and its stock price reflects a new found euphoria. \n \n Microsoft's redesign of the Zune came true, but it didn't include the phone I expected. Steve Ballmer tells me no way, but I still see the company entering the smart phone arena with a handset of its own. \n \n I predicted that Intel , HP, Cisco , IBM and Oracle were all oversold and that such lows presented good opportunities for investors. All of them would have been good bets last December. \n \n I asked whether Palm would survive 2009. Despite the Pre and the Pixi, I think the jury's still out. Dell is entering the smart phone market with hardware of its own. Maybe that means Nokia is the best (last? Only?) hope for Palm in 2010. \n \n I predicted that Advanced Micro Devices would be acquired in 2009. Didn't happen. With that $1 billion from Intel as part of that new settlement, 2010 could be a much better year for AMD. But \"much better\" is relative when you're scraping for Intel scraps merely to survive. \n \n I said Apple posed the biggest opportunity for tech investors in 2009 and I was right. I'd say the same holds true for 2010. Look for the tablet Mac, but not anywhere close to the $2,000 price tag being thrown around. Apple will re-invent mobile computing once again with this device, but beyond hardware and software, it'll do so with price as well. \n \n If 2009 was a big year for 3D movie-making, 3D TV will blossom big in 2010. New TVs from Sony , Samsung, LG and others will grab lots of attention, and new 3D TV production from upstarts like 3Ality will show viewers enormous possibilities. \n \n Some other predictions. \n \n \n \n This is cool stuff. Digital books and eReaders from Amazon , Sony, Barnes & Noble and 17 other manufacturers will enjoy their true break-out year. \n \n Microsoft will enjoy a big-time renaissance. Cisco continues to be one of this region's most exciting growth stories. Netbooks start to fade as a fad as consumers realize that their iPhones, Research In Motion's Blackberrys and Nokia smart phones get the job done at a fraction of the size (and cost.) \n \n And Twitter, as we know it, will fade away. Either acquired or shut down. $155 million in venture capital so far, and still no meaningful revenue stream to speak of. And certainly no profits. At some point, someone will step up and yell \"Tulips!\" \n \n Meantime, I'm sure of a few key predictions in 2010: Innovation and the entrepreneurial spirit will continue to thrive here in Silicon Valley. It's what makes my job so fun and America so great. ||||| My personal Top 10 technology predictions for 2010 \n \n One of my responsibilities as the Director of IT Innovations at PwC is to spend a good deal of time researching and developing insights on the impact of emerging technologies. This year, for the first time, I thought it might be fun and, frankly, quite useful to share with you my thoughts on what I believe may be the big IT trends in 2010. While I was somewhat tempted to be bold and creative in my forecast, I decided to ground the Top 10 in areas that have some real momentum. If you agree with the predictions, what might that mean for your work and your industry? In what area do you think I got it completely wrong? I\u2019d love to know what you think. \n \n 1. Software as a Service \n \n 2010 will be a big year for providers of software as a service (SaaS). The obvious big names in this space will release new offerings to compete with popular desktop applications. New and existing operating systems that are built primarily to support the SaaS model will begin to be more widely accepted and adopted. \n \n 2. Netbooks \n \n This popular form-factor will have outstanding sales and may even surpass laptop sales by year-end. Given its remarkable low-cost, we will likely see more offerings that make available free Netbooks. In addition, the ubiquity of embedded Web-cams will drive further use of personal video in both non-work and work environments. \n \n 3. Cloud Services \n \n An obvious growth area in 2010; we will see new and expanded services from all the usual suspects. Expect major announcements from large businesses and government agencies choosing to move some of their core applications and data to the cloud. \n \n 4. Mobile Money \n \n By late 2010, paying for products and services via a mobile device such as a cellphone will begin to emerge in the mainstream US. Multiple flavors will be available including custom applications and text messaging. More likely in 2011-12 will be the emergence of banking services from the big Telco\u2019s. Rather than simply being a middleman, the telecommunication companies may announce banking divisions. \n \n 5. Free Software \n \n If current trends continue, it\u2019s quite possible that all software will be available in a form of free, but 2010 will be the first year that this trend reaches a point of inflection. A combination of enterprise-class open source, freemium, freeware, ad-supported, and alternate revenue-model software will have lasting and destructive impact on the notion of license-paid software. \n \n 6. Harvesting the Social Graph and Web-Squared \n \n 2010 will see the introduction of the first widely available and easily usable products for better understanding the mass of unstructured data being accumulated across public and private clouds. The emergence of intelligent solutions to interpret massive related and un-related data in order to create forecasts and identify trends will help people make more sense of the world and see previously hidden signals. \n \n 7. More Video \n \n Continued investment in video infrastructures will see greater use in work and non-work environments. It will be more common (but still not ubiquitous) to have video conversations with colleagues and external parties such as customers and suppliers. Rigorous competition in this space between the major players and many start-ups will continue to push the price down for high-quality video. Greater use of PCs and Netbooks with Web-cams will continue towards critical mass. In addition, content creation will continue its profound migration from text to video, further consuming bandwidth and forcing more enterprise investment in network infrastructure. \n \n 8. Green IT \n \n This may be a inconsistent area of investment as continued tight budgets and more immediate costs (e.g. migration to updated operating system) distract from major green initiatives. However, going into 2011 and beyond, broad adoption of virtualization and further movement towards hosting in the cloud may help organizations lower their data center carbon footprint. \n \n 9. Mobile Location-based Services (LBS) and Augmented Reality \n \n Expect to see an extraordinary number of start-ups and existing technology companies offering mobile LBS-related services. Proximity-based solutions will become more common. Mobile devices will begin to offer compelling overlay data for the real world that help people with existing and new activities. Lots of noise and confusion will ensue as both consumers and providers try to figure out acceptable services. For example: how will people respond when they stroll through a mall and are bombarded with text messages from different retail stores? \n \n 10. Social Spaghetti Integration \n \n More social features will begin to show up in ERP apps. New and increased support for ERP solutions that, for example: integrate social networking will see a further blurring of the lines between work and non-work applications and activities. \n \n Do you agree or disagree with any of my predictions? I\u2019d love to know what you think. ||||| But real-time is more than just a horde of new Twitter-like services hitting the Web in 2010 (although that's inevitable -- cargo cults abound). It's a combination of factors, from the always-connected nature of modern smartphones to the instant gratification provided by a Google search. \n \n Why wait until you get home to post a restaurant review, asks consumer trends tracker Trendwatching, when scores of iPhone apps let you post feedback as soon as you finish dessert? Why wonder about the name of that song, when humming into your phone handset will garner an instant answer from Midomi? \n \n Look out, too, for real-time collaboration: Google Wave launched earlier this year, resulting in both excitement and confusion. A crossover between instant messaging, e-mail and a wiki, Wave is a platform for getting things done together. Web users, however, remain baffled. In 2010, Wave's utility will become more apparent. \n \n Location, location, location \n \n Fueled by the ubiquity of GPS in modern smartphones, location-sharing services like Foursquare, Gowalla, Brightkite and Google Latitude are suddenly in vogue. \n \n As I ruminated in this column two weeks ago, Foursquare and its ilk may become the breakout services of the year ... provided they're not crushed by the addition of location-based features to Twitter and Facebook. \n \n What's clear is that location is not about any singular service; rather, it's a new layer of the Web. Soon, our whereabouts may optionally be appended to every Tweet, blog comment, photo or video we post. \n \n Augmented reality \n \n It's yet to become part of the consumer consciousness, but augmented reality has attracted early-adopter buzz in the latter part of 2009. ||||| Tablet PCs suck. They're underpowered, only marginally portable, and awkward to use in anything but a traditional seated position, with a desk to support them. Microsoft and its cadre of hardware partners have been trying for years to create a compelling tablet computing experience -- and consistently failed. Yet this year, persistent rumors of an Apple tablet -- an \"iTablet\" -- created a real buzz. But to believe that Apple can somehow succeed where all others have failed is to ignore some fundamental realities of tablet computing. \n \n Reality No. 1: The lap doesn't work as a desk \n \n Have you ever tried filling out a paper questionnaire on a moving train? Even with a clipboard, the mechanics are anything but graceful. With each lurch or bump you risk missing the mark. At best you end up with illegible chicken scratch; at worst, you put the pen right through the paper. It's a real mess. \n \n [ Stay up on tech news and reviews from your smartphone at infoworldmobile.com. | Get the best iPhone apps for pros with our business iPhone apps finder. | See which smartphone is right for you in our mobile \"deathmatch\" calculator. ] \n \n Now imagine this same scenario with the iTablet. You're trying to enter an e-mail address or a URL using a nifty onscreen keypad. Each time you aim for the \"R\" key you end up hitting \"T\" instead. Then, just as you go to touch the Send button, you slip and hit Cancel -- or worse. \n \n Contrast this with a typical small laptop or netbook, where the combination of your lap and palms acts as stabilizing influences. Add the surety of a traditional keyboard -- for typing, navigating, and so on -- and this \"lapdesk\" modus operandi gives the clamshell form factor a distinct advantage when operating in raucous mobile environments. ||||| Smart phones will become more prevalent and NetBooks will take off, which along with broader WiFi and faster broadband speeds will make it easier to access even high-definition content on the go. \n \n I expect the movie giants to experiment with \"collapsing windows,\" thereby offering video-on-demand before DVD releases, giving consumers more home video options closer to a movie\u2019s theatrical release. \n \n The big question is whether consumers will have to pay for access to the distribution stream, as moguls like Rupert Murdoch threaten to start charging for News Corp\u2019s web sites. \n \n \n \n But even if sites start charging, there will always be a free alternative. And when you do pay, it will be for premium, differentiated products\u2014the equivalent of HBO and Showtime\u2014and will probably seem worth it. \n \n 2. Social media will grow and be increasingly influential. \n \n Social networks and communication tools will only grow in size and influence. Twitter and Facebook allow word of mouth to travel faster than ever, and that will only accelerate as more people get smart phones and sign up for social networking services. \n \n \n \n Social media will prove increasingly crucial for marketers to reach consumers on their home turf. And it will increasingly be the filter through which we find and consume content. \n \n \n \n The platform Twitter and Facebook provide for consumers to broadcast their opinions will continue to disarm traditional advertising. Opinions fly so fast that movie marketers can no longer \u201cbuy\u201d a huge opening weekend; now it\u2019s far more important to get moviegoers on board, to have them spread the word about the film. \n \n We can expect marketers of every kind to try to learn from the huge success of Paramount\u2019s \u201cParanormal Activity.\u201d The film's promotional campaign asks consumers to \u201crequest\u201d that the movie open in their town. \n \n \n \n Social media is sure to also have growing influence over the way we consume content. We follow the lead of friends who share articles or videos on Facebook. Twitter enables a customized news feed, with nearly every possible publication, blogger and journalist on board. And MySpace is turning itself into a destination for content, and for strangers in real life to be virtual friends because of shared interests. \n \n \n \n 3. More content than ever will be produced, forcing media giants to distinguish themselves from unprofessional alternatives. \n \n \n \n The sheer amount of content available in 2010 will explode. These days it\u2019s so easy to produce and distribute content, through YouTube , blogs populated by ads, or even a Twitter feed. That means consumers will be able to find that a blog or news site seems made just for them. Fragmentation reaches far beyond user-generated content, the cable world will continue to profit from this drive for narrower channels. \n \n \n \n Oprah Winfrey\u2019s move from broadcast syndication to her own cable network, OWN, speaks to the ongoing shift to greater choice that we\u2019ll see in 2010. Viewers will continue their shift away from broadcast to more niche cable networks and advertisers will follow them. People will still watch TV instead of YouTube videos because the quality and the production value are still that much higher; user-generated options just can\u2019t compete. \n \n \n \n Print media will struggle even more to compete in a world crowded with citizen journalism and user-generated blogs. We can expect more local newspapers to go under as they lose subscribers and ad dollars to free, online alternatives. Even web sites like Huffington Post, which doesn\u2019t pay many of its bloggers, can deal a real blow to national papers\u2019 online traffic. \n \n \n \n Meanwhile, the movie studios are dealing with the proliferation of entertainment options by moving in the opposite direction; they\u2019re looking to capture the mainstream. Making movies is so expensive it doesn\u2019t make sense to invest in a movie that will only attract a tiny niche. The studios will make fewer films, eliminating specialty- or art-film divisions, and instead invest in sure-thing bets. They will acquire independent films if they see real mainstream potential, like Paramount did with \u201cParanormal Activity,\u201d but they won\u2019t invest in making and distributing niche products. ||||| Paul Sancya, AP \n \n Paul Sakuma, AP \n \n Sponsored Links \n \n If 2010 taught us anything, it's that few people are able to accurately predict even the simplest events in the near-term future, let alone the big ones. From the price of gold, to unemployment, to Google Wave, prognosticators got more than a few major items wrong in their predictions lists.Here, in no particular order, are \"10 for 10\" -- 10 of the worst predictions of 2010.\"Unemployment Drops Below 9 Percent,\" Newsweek \"business predictions for 2010,\" December 2009.Unfortunately, despite increasing efforts to contain our nation's unemployment epidemic, the unemployment rate never dipped below 9.5 percent, and climbed to 9.8 percent in November. Let's hope that a dip in the unemployment rate below 9.5 percent is something we will see in the coming year.\"The GOP will make good, though not great, gains in the midterms,\" John Berbyshire, National Review , Dec. 30, 2009Republicans took an incredible 63 seats in the House and came within just a few seats of taking the Senate. But the next part of Derbyshire's prediction -- \"They will immediately embark on a strategy guaranteed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory\" -- may still come to pass.\"A new social network will rise to join the big ones.\" Marshall Kirkpatrick, ReadWriteWeb , Dec. 24, 2009.Not quite. In fact, 2010 was the year of Facebook. It topped 500 million users, it was the subject of constant IPO speculation, Time named its founder Person of the Year, and it spawned a hugely successful feature film. Meantime, its competitors struggled to stay afloat (looking at you, MySpace and Bebo). In short, no one is even attempting to challenge Facebook for supremacy. Perhaps someday a new player will rise to make the king of all social networks a second-rate choice, but that day doesn't look to be coming any time soon.\"Twitter, as we know it, will fade away. Either acquired or shut down.\" CNBC Tech Check Predictions 2010 , Dec. 1, 2009Many predicted the downfall and/or complete demise of Twitter in 2010, and many were completely wrong. Twitter has instead silenced its critics by gaining more than 100 million users, increasing staff from 130 to 350 people and raising more than $200 million in financing, raising its value to $3.7 billion, all during the past 12 months \"To believe that Apple can somehow succeed where all others have failed is to ignore some fundamental realities of tablet computing.\" Randall C. Kennedy, Infoworld.com , Dec. 22, 2009Apple still hasn't lost its golden touch: More than 4 million iPad buyers in a single quarter can attest to that.\"In 2010 ... netbooks will take off,\" Julia Boorstin, CNBC , Dec. 1, 2009Between the announcement and introduction of the iPad and its many tablet-based competitors, and the lack of performance and high prices, netbook sales spiraled downward in 2010. Expect a continued free-fall in sales unless prices are slashed drastically, or the iPad ceases to exist.\"In 2010, Wave's utility will become more apparent,\" Pete Cashmore, CNN Tech , Dec. 3, 2009Massively over-hyped during its introduction in late 2009, Google Wave was to be the central hub of our lives, merging our e-mail, social networking, instant messaging, wiki and every other form of digital media in one \"easy to use\" package. \"Easy to use\" it was not, however. So while some were optimistic that Google Wave's utility would shine through eventually, the rest of us decided to simply ignore its clunky, scatterbrained approach to digital life.Google promptly flushed Wave down the toilet in August, less than a year after its introduction.\"A serious correction could send the precious metal toward $870,\" Saxo Bank analysts, cited by CNBC , Dec. 17, 2009.Not even close to coming true.

Considering where unemployment's been over the past two years, and where we feared it might be headed, sub-9 percent unemployment should be seen as a success 12 months from now, and is certainly attainable. From end to end, this recession cost us 7.2 million jobs, and essentially doubled the unemployment rate, from 4.9 percent in December 2007 to our current 10 percent. Give or take a month or two, that took two years. So shedding one point in 12 months, a 10 percent change, shouldn't be a problem. We're already headed in the right direction, having fallen from 10.2 percent to 10 percent from October to November. Since we usually add jobs in December, if only temporary ones, by early 2010 we'll likely be looking at an unemployment rate in the high 9 percent range. And don't forget: unemployment is a lagging indicator. So the economic growth that began last summer and that most economists think will continue through next year, should be more than enough to pull unemployment below 9 percent, especially with Congress's new job-creation package. Now, that's not to say that it won't spike back above 10 percent in 2011. State budgets are still a huge mess, and with no stimulus cash to bridge deficits next time around, there could be a wave of laid-off cops and teachers and firemen coming down the line. But again, unemployment's lagging, so that probably won't hit, if it does at all, until 2011; just in time for the president to start campaigning again.",

He marked the Joker's April 25, 1940, comic book debut by tweeting the first image released of Jared Leto as Joker, the role he's playing in the film. It's a Joker complete with green hair, crimson lips, nasty teeth, and a tattoo-heavy body. Among the ink: \"HA\" repeated over and over, and a cursive \"Damaged\" on the forehead. Rolling Stone reports the look was inspired by Batman: The Killing Joke, and points out that it's not the first time Ayer has referenced Alan Moore's graphic novel. That leads the magazine to speculate that Leto's turn as the Joker in the film\u2014due Aug. 5, 2016\u2014will hew closer to Moore's Joker, a bust-of-a-stand-up comic who is disfigured and goes crazy in the span of a single day.

    "document": "When British Prime Minister David Cameron visits President Barack Obama this week, one detail may stay bottled up: the labels on the wines the White House pours at the state dinner tomorrow night. \n \n For Obama\u2019s first three state dinners, honoring the leaders of India, Mexico and China, the White House released the name, year and appellation of wines -- all-American -- paired with each course. \n \n Part of a tradition observed by previous presidents, including George W. Bush, that disclosure stopped after Obama\u2019s dinner last year for Chinese President Hu Jintao. One of the wines served on Jan. 19, 2011, was a top-rated 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon from Washington state that originally sold for $115 a bottle and went for as much as $399 by the time of the dinner. The price the White House paid per bottle was not made public. \n \n At the next state dinner, on June 7, 2011, for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the menu made public by the White House didn\u2019t include details on the wines. \n \n \u201cAn American wine will be paired with each course,\u201d stated a note at the bottom of the menu released by the White House. So went as well the menu released for the Korean State Dinner honoring President Lee Myung-Bak on Oct. 13, 2011. \n \n Tyler Colman, who writes the Dr. Vino wine blog and teaches at New York University, said in an interview that the shift in menu protocol may reflect political considerations given the sluggish U.S. economy. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re probably sensitive to displays of wealth at a time when the economy is not firing on all cylinders,\u201d said Colman, whose blog had noted the absence of wines on the German state dinner menu the White House released. \n \n No \u2018Picnic\u2019 \n \n Still, keeping the wine list under wraps undercuts promotion of U.S. winemakers at a time when markets in developing nations such as China have potential to be \u201creally hot\u201d for U.S. labels because of the rising middle- and upper- income classes, he said. \n \n A state dinner \u201cisn\u2019t a picnic or casual get-together,\u201d and it\u2019s justifiable from diplomatic and trade standpoints for the White House to spend money to showcase fine American wines, Colman said. \n \n Dorothy Gaiter, wine and food editor for the quarterly France Magazine and a former wine columnist for the Wall Street Journal, said Obama was private about his wine preferences before his election. \n \n \u2018Good for America\u2019 \n \n If the Obama White House has decided to stop publicizing which American wines are served at official events, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand this. It\u2019s good for America.\u201d \n \n Rick Small is co-owner of the Woodward Canyon winery in Lowden, Washington, whose 2009 Chardonnay was among the wines poured for the German dinner. \n \n He and his wife noticed the shift because they had gotten billing on the menu when their wine was served at a Clinton administration dinner. He said he didn\u2019t know why the practice was changed and that it probably does help the industry overall to have U.S. wines publicized by name. \n \n At the same time, Small said, it\u2019s an honor to be chosen at all. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get pushy about it since they picked your wine,\u201d he said. \n \n The White House declined to comment for this article or to make available Daniel Shanks, the usher who has managed wine selection since the Clinton administration, or social secretary Jeremy Bernard. First Lady Michelle Obama\u2019s office referred questions to the White House press office. \n \n No Disclosure \n \n White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest declined to disclose which wines were served at the German or Korean state dinners, identify wines from non-state dinners, make menus of past meals available for inspection or answer questions about the shift in practice. \n \n Earnest also declined to say whether the White House would release the names of wines at the Cameron dinner. \n \n The White House has promoted its release of other documents and data. On March 8, it announced a website, www.ethics.gov, to expand access to government databases tracking White House visitor records, lobbying disclosures and Federal Election Commission reports. \n \n \u201cFrom the day he took office, the president committed his administration to work towards unprecedented openness in government,\u201d said the official statement announcing the site. \n \n At the state dinner for Hu, the 2005 Quilceda Creek Cabernet Sauvignon Columbia Valley from Washington state, one of the wines poured that night, was $115 a bottle at release, the winery\u2019s general manager, John Ware said in an interview. \n \n Turning Point \n \n The wine earned a rare 100-point rating from wine critic Robert Parker. By the time of the White House dinner, Ware said, it sold for $300-$350. It was listed for as much as $399 per bottle, according to wine websites. \n \n Ware said the winery was approached by the White House and asked to choose which of its wines to serve. The price the winery charged the White House was \u201ccloser to the $115\u201d than to $399, Ware said, while declining to name the price. \n \n Afterward, he said, the winery\u2019s profile in Asia got a \u201cpretty significant\u201d boost. \n \n The White House selection drew derision. \n \n The day after the Hu dinner, the anti-Obama website Gateway Pundit carried a posting entitled, \u201cSacrifice Is For the Little People... Obama White House Serves $399 Bottles of Wine at State Dinner.\u201d \n \n Comedian Stephen Colbert said that, given the U.S. debt held by China, the Hu dinner \u201cshould have been a sweatpants- potluck with box wine and a sleeve of Oreos.\u201d \n \n Social Secretaries \n \n Other changes were taking place at the White House at the time. Between the Chinese and German state dinners, the White House changed social secretaries, hiring Bernard that February. \n \n Since the start of his presidency, aides also have avoided endorsing specific brands such as which golf clubs Obama favors. \n \n Not all wines served by the administration are shielded. At Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s dinner last month for Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping, the list included a 2010 Sauvignon Blanc and 2009 Cabernet Sauvignon from the Hall winery in California\u2019s Napa Valley. The wines sell for $22.99 and $48.99 per bottle, respectively, on the wine.com website. Vintner Kathryn Hall was U.S. ambassador to Austria during the Clinton administration. She didn\u2019t return calls for comment. \n \n Wine has been regularly served at the Executive Residence since 1800, except from 1877-1881 under President Rutherford B. Hayes, Shanks wrote in 2007 for an article for the Journal of the White House Historical Association. \n \n Kennedy and Nixon \n \n In the 20th century, John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon were known for their familiarity with French wine. The policy of serving American wine took hold in Lyndon Johnson\u2019s administration, according to an article in last month\u2019s Wine Spectator. Ronald Reagan, a former actor and California governor, raised the profile of his home state\u2019s wines. \n \n Ulises Valdez, 42, of the Valdez Family Winery and Tasting Room in Cloverdale, California, said he is \u201cstill celebrating\u201d having his 2008 Silver Eagle Vineyard Chardonnay served at the White House for the Mexico state dinner on May 19, 2010. \n \n Valdez snuck into the U.S., from Mexico, as a teenager and found work picking grapes. He got amnesty during the Reagan administration. Today he owns a vineyard management company and the winery. \u201cThis is the beauty of the U.S. --if you\u2019re a hard worker and good and honest you can do it,\u201d he said. \n \n White House menus can be a point of pride and business builder for individual vintners whose wines are chosen. \n \n China Sales \u2018Quadrupled\u2019 \n \n Kerry Murphy, proprietor of DuMOL Wines in Orinda, California, whose wines have been served at the White House since 2002, said he\u2019s become a collector. \u201cGod knows how many menus I have -- I love \u2019em,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve been blessed by the association,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt sets the wine to high standards,\u201d he said, because the White House \u201ccan buy whatever they want.\u201d \n \n His Chardonnays sell for $50-$60 per bottle. \n \n After his 2008 Russian River Chardonnay was served at the Hu dinner, he said, \u201cour sales in China quadrupled.\u201d \n \n \u201cI think that has a lot to do just with exposure from that one dinner,\u201d he said. \u2019\u2019It makes me feel good because we\u2019ve got some dollars coming back\u2019\u2019 to the U.S. from China. \u201cThat\u2019s a patriotic thing in itself.\u201d \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Margaret Talev in Washington at mtalev@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Steven Komarow at skomarow1@bloomberg.net ||||| President Barack Obama is giving an enthusiastic visitor, British Prime Minister David Cameron, his first taste of college basketball _ and for Obama a chance to tap into a sports audience in Ohio, a state important to his re-election hopes. \n \n President Barack Obama and Britain Prime Minister David Cameron attend the Mississippi Valley State game against Western Kentucky in a first round NCAA tournament basketball game, Tuesday, March 13, 2012,...

(Associated Press) \n \n President Barack Obama and Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron eat hot dogs as they attend the Mississippi Valley State versus Western Kentucky in a first round NCAA tournament basketball game, Tuesday,... (Associated Press) \n \n Obama, an avid basketball fan, on Tuesday took Cameron to Dayton on Air Force One for an NCAA basketball tournament game between Mississippi Valley State and Western Kentucky. \n \n Obama's verdict on the game during a halftime interview on truTV was that \"both teams are shooting terrible\" in the low-scoring contest, but that maybe the teams were nervous. \n \n Cameron said he was enjoying the fast-and-furious action in what marked the British leader's first college basketball game. \n \n Cameron quipped that Obama was going to help him fill out his bracket. \n \n THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. \n \n Basketball fan-in-chief President Barack Obama is giving British Prime Minister David Cameron a front-row seat to March Madness, taking his European partner to an election swing state for an NCAA tournament basketball game. \n \n Amid cheers, the two leaders entered the University of Dayton Arena on Tuesday for a \"First Four\" matchup between Mississippi Valley State and Western Kentucky, a gesture of goodwill during Cameron's official visit to the United States and a way for an incumbent president to reach sports fans in an election year. \n \n Adding to the heavy hoops flavor of the day, Obama announced his NCAA tournament bracket picks to ESPN, the sports network he watches on a daily basis. On Tuesday, the network teased Obama's selections by revealing his Final Four picks: Kentucky, Ohio State, Missouri and North Carolina. \n \n It was the fourth straight year that Obama filled out an NCAA tournament bracket for ESPN. On the women's side, he selected Baylor, St. John's, Connecticut and Notre Dame to advance. \n \n ESPN will reveal the president's full men's bracket Wednesday. \n \n Cameron's sporting tastes run more toward tennis, cricket and soccer. Tuesday's was the first college basketball game he's seen. \n \n The White House said the trip to the NCAA tournament game was intended to showcase the special relationship between the two key allies during Cameron's three-day visit. Obama and Cameron will discuss the upcoming NATO and G-8 summits on Wednesday, followed by a state dinner at the White House. \n \n Obama and Cameron were scheduled to appear in a live halftime interview on truTV, which was airing the game, with sportscaster Clark Kellogg. Kellogg interviewed Obama at halftime of a Duke-Georgetown game in 2010 and spoke with the president later that year during a White House game of \"HORSE\" aired on CBS during the NCAA tournament. \n \n Joining Obama at the game was Ohio's Republican Gov. John Kasich, who greeted Obama with a big handshake at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Kasich gave Obama two letters, which his office said were from the governor's twin daughters, who wanted to welcome the Democratic president to the state. \n \n Still, other Republicans panned the trip, saying many Americans would prefer Obama to focus on more pressing issues. \n \n \"While showing off our amazing college basketball teams is great, many Americans struggling to find jobs, dealing with soaring gas prices, or concerned with our rising deficit and debt would probably like the president spend at least as much time dealing with those issues,\" said Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee \n \n Obama's quick trip to Ohio gives him a chance to connect with basketball fans and generate attention in Ohio, which he carried in the 2008 election and is considered one of the top toss-up states in 2012. The trip comes one week after Republican front-runner Mitt Romney captured Ohio's GOP primary. \n \n It also lets Obama lavish praise and attention on Cameron at a time of weighty foreign policy challenges in Afghanistan, Iran and Syria. Britain has been an important U.S. ally in Afghanistan and the bombing campaign in Libya that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi. \n \n Cameron is frequently spotted running near his official Downing Street residence, flanked by his security detail. But he's not much of a basketball fan; British Ambassador Peter Westmacott told reporters in Washington on Monday that Cameron was \"busy briefing himself on March Madness.\" \n \n Basketball has been a big part of Obama's life. At his Hawaii high school, Obama frequently carried a basketball along with his school books and bonded with his teammates on the court. His brother-in-law, Craig Robinson, played college basketball at Princeton and is now head coach at Oregon State. \n \n The president regularly plays pickup basketball and keeps close tabs on his favorite NBA team, the Chicago Bulls. In a recent interview, the president said he gets League Pass on his iPad, letting him watch out-of-market NBA games on his tablet computer. \n \n Obama kicked off the basketball season with a Veterans Day game between Michigan State and North Carolina on the flight deck of the USS Carl Vinson in November, enjoying a game on the aircraft carrier that took Osama bin Laden's body to a burial at sea after the U.S. raid that killed the al-Qaida leader. \n \n The president said in an interview last month with journalist Bill Simmons that the \"mythology of sports\" is deeply embedded in the U.S., allowing viewers to discern who is winning and who is losing _ a principle that could easily be transferred to politics. \n \n \"People _ for all our differences politically, regionally, economically _ most folks understand sports. Probably because it's one of the few places where it's a true meritocracy,\" Obama said. \"Ultimately, who's winning, who's losing, who's performing, who's not _ it's all laid out there.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Anne Gearan contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Ken Thomas on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/AP_Ken_Thomas",

So when Angela Merkel was honored at a state dinner in June, the released menu said nothing more than \"an American wine will be paired with each course.\" Ditto for South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak's Oct. 13 menu. And while the move may ostensibly make sense (\"they\u2019re probably sensitive to displays of wealth at a time when the economy is not firing on all cylinders,\" says one wine expert), many argue the move hurts, instead of helps. Promoting top winemakers \"is good for America,\" says one wine editor, and Bloomberg notes that state dinners provide a prime opportunity to show China and other new big wine importers what the US has to offer. To wit, Quilceda Creek saw a \"pretty significant\" uptick in Asia after Hu's dinner.",

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 \"The village is gripped by fear,\" the mayor of Minihy-Tr\u00e9guier, France, tells the Telegraph. More than 100 pet rabbits have been killed by a serial killer who sneaks into people's gardens, removes their hutches, kills them with a sharp object or by crushing them with his foot, and then leaves their dead bodies where they died. The killer strikes when owners leave home, raising fears that properties are being watched. Local residents believe that the killer must know the area to be able to identify people with rabbit hutches that are not visible from the road. Police in the Ctes-d\u2019Armor region denounced a \"series of acts of cruelty against domestic rabbits\" in and around the town. \"The cages are opened then the animals are killed,\" says Jean-Yves Fenvarc'h, the mayor of Minihy-Tr\u00e9guier, a pretty spot popular with tourists and home to a handful of British expats. Fenvarc'h says the attacks, which began in March, eased off before starting again in August, and resumed earlier this month. What makes the situation particularly scary is the fact that the killer sometimes returns to the scene of a crime to kill again. The rabbits he kills are often kept by elderly people who house them in their gardens, sometimes alongside chickens or geese. \"He [the killer] never touches the chickens or the geese,\" says Fenvarc'h. Police believe the killer is human rather than a fox or a wild animal, or a fox.",

Rita Newcomb was arrested at her home in South Webster, Ohio. \n \n \"They did this quickly, coldly, calmly and very carefully \u2013 but not carefully enough,\" said.

Clark said the family hopes the true culprits were brought to justice. \n \n \"They are hopeful for a thorough vetting of the facts,\" Clark said. \n \n Authorities have repeatedly said the killers worked to cover their tracks, adding complexity to what is the largest homicide investigation in Ohio history.

(Associated Press) \n \n This undated images released by the Ohio Attorney General's office, shows Angela Wagner, one of four family members that has been arrested in the slayings of eight members of one family in rural Ohio two years ago, authorities announced Tuesday, Nov. 13, 2018. (Ohio Attorney General's office via AP) (Associated Press) \n \n COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) \u2014 A family of four arrested Tuesday in the gruesome slayings of eight people from another family in rural Ohio two years ago carefully planned the killings for months in a crime prosecutors vaguely explained as a custody dispute, authorities said. \n \n Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said a grand jury indicted the four on aggravated murder charges and that could be sentenced to death if convicted. \n \n DeWine gave scant detail about why they were killed, but did say the custody of young child played a role. \n \n Arrested were four members of the Wagner family, who lived near the scenes of the killing about 60 miles (97 kilometers) south of Columbus. \n \n One of those arrested was Edward \"Jake\" Wagner, 26, who was a long-time former boyfriend of 19-year-old Hanna Rhoden, one of the eight victims, and shared custody of their daughter at the time of the massacre. \n \n The others arrested were Wagner's father, George \"Billy\" Wagner III, 47; his wife, 48-year-old Angela Wagner; and George Wagner, 27. \n \n The Wagners had moved to Alaska, but authorities said three were arrested in Ohio. \n \n Police in Kentucky say the FBI tracked \"Billy\" Wagner to Lexington, where he was arrested without incident at around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday. Lexington police weren't sure if he had been living in the area. \n \n Authorities said Wagner was arrested in a horse trailer that was pulled over. \n \n It's the culmination of a massive investigative effort since seven adults and a teenage boy were found shot in the head at four homes in April 2016. \n \n Investigators scrambling to determine who targeted the Rhoden family and why had conducted over 130 interviews and processed over 100 pieces of evidence and 550 tips, while getting assistance from more than 20 law enforcement agencies. \n \n Dewine said the case involved an \"obsession with the custody and control of children\" and called it one of the most bizarre situations he has seen. \n \n He also said the Wagner family knew the victims well and spent months studying their routines and the layouts of their homes. \"They had thought about it, a lot\" he said. \n \n Authorities in June of 2017 announced they were seeking information about the Wagners, including details on personal or business interactions and conversations that people may have had with the four. \n \n None was named a suspect at the time. Investigators also said they had searched property in southern Ohio sold by the Wagners. \n \n Both Jake Wagner and Angela Wagner told the Cincinnati Enquirer they were not involved in the April 2016 killings. \n \n Angela Wagner said in an email to the newspaper that what happened was devastating and Hanna Rhoden was like a daughter to her. \n \n Wagner also told The Enquirer that her husband, Billy, and Christopher Rhoden Sr. were more like brothers than friends. \n \n John Clark, a lawyer who has been representing the Wagners, said a year ago that four of the Wagner family members had provided laptops, phones and DNA samples to investigators, and agreed to be interviewed about the slayings. \n \n Clark said Tuesday the family will be vindicated. \n \n \"We look forward to the day when the true culprits will be discovered and brought to justice for this terrible tragedy,\" Clark said in a statement. He added: \"The Wagners are also very hopeful that in the ensuing months there will be a thorough vetting of all the facts.\" \n \n The Wagner family has lived in Peebles, Ohio, at the time of the killings but later moved to Alaska. \n \n Clark told The Cincinnati Enquirer that the family was being \"harassed while the real killer or killers are out there.\" \n \n A coroner said all but one of the victims was shot more than once, including two people shot five times and one shot nine times. Some also had bruising, consistent with the first 911 caller's description of two victims appearing to have been beaten. The coroner's report didn't specify which victims had which wounds. \n \n Authorities said marijuana growing operations were found at three of the four crime scenes. That's not uncommon in this corner of Appalachia but stoked rumors that the slayings were related to drugs, one of many theories on possible motives that percolated in public locally. \n \n The victims were identified as 40-year-old Christopher Rhoden; his ex-wife, 37-year-old Dana Rhoden; their three children, 20-year-old Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden, 16-year-old Christopher Jr., and 19-year-old Hanna; Frankie Rhoden's fianc\u00e9e, 20-year-old Hannah Gilley; Christopher Rhoden Sr.'s brother, 44-year-old Kenneth Rhoden; and a cousin, 38-year-old Gary Rhoden. Hanna Rhoden's days-old baby girl, another baby and a young child were unharmed. \n \n It appeared some of them were killed as they slept, including Hanna Rhoden, who was in bed with her newborn nearby, authorities said. The child, Hannah Gilley's 6-month-old baby and another small child weren't hurt. \n \n Three funerals were held for the victims. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press Writers John Seewer in Toledo and Dylan T. Lovan in Louisville, Kentucky, contributed to this report. ||||| The father of a surviving Rhoden child started a Gofundme account to help with legal bills he acquired to gain custody of his toddler-aged daughter. \n \n Jake Wagner, the father of Sophia Wagner, created a GoFundMe account to help defray attorney costs related to his custody battle. Sophia is the daughter of Hanna Rhoden, who was killed with seven other members of her family April 22. (Photo: Provided) \n \n Jake Wagner still can't quite bring himself to tell his 2 1/2-year-old daughter that her mommy is dead. \n \n It's the finality of that word that stops him. He worries about the tow-headed toddler's unpredictable reaction. There will be, he knows, so many questions. He is concerned, too, she may become frightened. \n \n He knows there will come a day when he will tell Sophia that her mom, Hanna Rhoden, was shot and killed with seven of her extended family members on April 22. He knows another day will arrive when he and she will make the trip to the cemetery where her mom is buried alongside two of her uncles and her maternal grandparents. \n \n \"I've told her that mommy is with Jesus and we will see her again later,'' Wagner said. \"I don't know if she knows Hanna isn't coming back. \n \n \"I don't know if she understands.\" \n \n How could she? \n \n In addition to her mom, also killed were: her grandparents, Christopher Rhoden, 40, and Dana Rhoden, 37; her uncles, Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden, 20, and Christopher Rhoden Jr., 16; a great uncle, Kenneth Rhoden, 44; and a cousin, Gary Rhoden, 38. Also killed was Frankie Rhoden's fiancee Hannah Gilley, 20. \n \n Two of her cousins, Ruger Rhoden, then 6 months, and Brentley Rhoden, 3, along with her newborn sister, Kylie, were found alive and physically unhurt in the trailers they shared with their parents. \n \n The investigation is now in its fourth month with no stated motive nor suspects and no arrests. And as the criminal case is moving along, so is the business of custody and estates. Neither is easy. \n \n A memorial at Ohio 32 and Union Hill Road in Pike County, where some of the eight victims were killed.

(Photo: Liz Dufour) \n \n 'Hate seeing my daughter cry' \n \n This is Wagner's new reality: Full-time, single dad with mounting legal bills with a new job that pays half what he was making to ensure he is close to Sophia. But close still means the 23-year-old makes a daily commute from Peebles to Cincinnati, a 2 1/2-hour daily drive. \n \n Wagner won custody of his little girl last month in Pike County, he said. And while the ruling was not unexpected, the legal bills were. This week Wagner set up a GoFundMe account in an effort to defray the legal bills and other unexpected but associated costs. He didn't know about the website until his mother mentioned it to him. He said he didn't want to draw attention to himself or to his daughter, but also didn't see a way out of the debt he has incurred since the homicide. \n \n \"These were not expenses I was supposed to have. I was just supposed to be able to spend time with her and give her a happy childhood, she is only 2 1/2 years old,'' Wagner wrote on the page of the crowd-fundraising site. \"Sophia and I are just asking for enough to settle the fees that we acquired due to the horrific tragedy to her mommy. \n \n \"We want to get our lives back,'' he wrote. \"I hate seeing my daughter cry.\" \n \n Wagner set a fundraising goal of $20,000, but said his legal bills were not quite that high. But, he added, his legal bills were four times more than what he expected. The former over-the-road truck driver and trained mechanic has maxed out his credit cards. He said he is paying his lawyer in what is left over after he pays his other bills every month. It hardly makes a dent. \n \n Hanna Rhoden and Wagner shared custody of Sophia, who was supposed to be with her mom that fateful Friday evening, he said. But Wagner picked her up a day earlier than normal: \"I reckon we missed it by just hours.\" \n \n Hanna Rhoden after giving birth to her daughter Kylie on April 17. (Photo: Provided) \n \n Sophia's 5-day-old baby sister, Kylie, was nuzzled next their mom when she was killed. The baby remains in the protective custody of the county as officials have been working to establish her paternity. Wagner declined to publicly discuss the paternity case on Thursday, but has said that he and at least one other young man could be her father. \n \n Neither court nor county officials will discuss the custody issues surrounding Kylie and Ruger. The Pike County Children Services Board filed a motion asking the county's juvenile court to seal those records and related court proceedings in the case. The Enquirer believes the proceedings are public under Ohio law. A court hearing on the issue is set for Aug. 4. \n \n It's unclear if any family members have been able to see either Ruger or Kylie. Wagner knows that Sophia hasn't seen them since April 21. \n \n But he has taken her to play with her cousin Brentley at a playground. She was at a family wedding this past weekend. She recently visited her great-grandmother Geneva Rhoden, which put a rare smile on the 73-year-old's matriarch's face. \n \n Dad and daughter are working to find a sense of normalcy and routine. There are the four-wheeler rides he takes her on, to a nearby creek. She helps him in the barn with the animals. There are tea parties, nail polishing sessions and Disney videos. \n \n On the nights he makes it home before she drifts off to sleep, they read books together -- \"Finding Nemo\" is her current favorite. \n \n When they are all done, she interlocks her little fingers and she prays. \n \n \"And I have her talk to her mom.\" \n \n Chris Graves is the Enquirer's local columnist. She has been writing about the Rhoden family massacre since April.

An hour later, an event was created on Facebook by students from the University of Iowa Student Government and UI Dance Marathon. \n \n The vigil, which lasted 20 minutes, focused not on the way Tibbetts died, but on the way she chose to live. \n \n A University of Iowa student talked about how Tibbetts gave her the courage and confidence to go from a graduating high school class of 37 to a university class of thousands. \n \n The student, Breck Goodman, said Tibbetts seemed to have that effect on people. Tibbetts studied psychology when she was at UI; she was an advocate for mental health and genuinely cared about how people thought, Goodman said. \n \n Maybe most noticeably, Goodman said, Tibbetts always had a smile for the people she saw when walking across campus. \n \n The friend had her own request of the gathered students: Do the same. \n \n CLOSE Mollie Tibbetts' friend Breck Goodman speaks at a vigil on the University of Iowa campus.

He was introduced to the Lang family and gained employment there through a former girlfriend. \n \n He also lived on the property in a mobile home, said Mitch Mortvedt, assistant director of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. \n \n \"We continue to cooperate with the investigation, and we have provided information about our former employee, including his hiring records, to authorities,\" Craig Lang said during a press conference on the farm on Wednesday. \"There will be plenty of time later to discuss immigration. However, now is not that time.\" \n \n COMPLETE COVERAGE:All the latest Mollie Tibbetts information here \n \n Dane Lang is Craig's son. He said Rivera provided a state-issued government ID and social security number when applying for employment. The information is required to file a Form I-9, which verifies the identity and employment eligibility of a person in the U.S. \n \n As a voluntary second verification step, the business put Rivera's information through the Social Security Administration\u2019s number verification service, but Dane Lang said he and others assumed it was E-Verify.gov. \n \n E-verify.gov allows employers to check if the information on a Form I-9 matches Social Security Administration and Department of Homeland Security records. \n \n Employment verification officials consider E-Verify a more robust backgrounding system, because it includes immigration status and eligibility to work in the United States. A check of only a social security number verifies that the number, name and birth date an employee provided match information that exists in the federal Social Security database. \n \n Dane Lang said Rivera provided a different name when he applied for employment, but he would not share it on Wednesday, citing the investigation. \n \n \"This employee was considered in good standing,\" Dane Lang said. Rivera showed up to work on time, cooperated with the other employees and showed up every day, he said. \n \n Over the last month, the younger Lang said he didn't notice any changes in Rivera's behavior. He said he always worked well with his colleagues. \n \n \"I wish I had seen a difference, but I didn't,\" Dane Lang said. \n \n About 10 full-time and part-time employees work on the farm. He said the family was consulting with their immigration attorney on whether they can use E-Verify to check existing employees\u2019 background. \n \n Dane Lang would not confirm whether there were any non-U.S. citizens employed at the farm. \n \n He said the farm's employees are a part of the community and some of their kids have gone on to become homecoming king or a valedictorian. \n \n At least 100 threatening voicemail messages have been sent to Dane Lang since Tuesday, he said. People have threatened to burn down buildings and even kill his dog after learning Rivera was employed at the farm. \n \n \"This is a really scary situation,\" he said. \"And the unfortunate thing is, people are paying attention to me and we\u2019re forgetting about the heartbroken family in Brooklyn and the heartbroken community.\" \n \n The Register's Donnelle Eller contributed to this report. \n \n Read or Share this story: https://dmreg.co/2o37jcM ||||| Cristhian Bahena Rivera is escorted into the Poweshiek County Courthouse for his initial court appearance, Wednesday, Aug. 22, 2018, in Montezuma, Iowa.

(Associated Press) \n \n Cristhian Bahena Rivera is escorted into the Poweshiek County Courthouse for his initial court appearance, Wednesday, Aug. 22, 2018, in Montezuma, Iowa. Rivera is charged with first-degree murder in the death of Mollie Tibbetts, who disappeared July 18 from Brooklyn, Iowa. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall) (Associated Press) \n \n BROOKLYN, Iowa (AP) \u2014 For years, the young man from Mexico presented himself as a legal U.S. resident and reliable worker at a family dairy farm in small town Iowa, his employer said. \n \n But this week, the image of Cristhian Bahena Rivera transformed in a matter of hours. Now he's a man accused of illegally living and working in the U.S. on fraudulent documents, of being a predator who kidnapped and killed a beloved young woman, and to some, the monstrous face of a lax immigration system. \n \n Rivera made his initial court appearance Wednesday in a rural Iowa courthouse on a first-degree murder charge in the death of 20-year-old college student Mollie Tibbetts. He sat stone-faced and handcuffed in a striped jail jumpsuit as he said through an interpreter that he understood he faced life in prison if convicted. He was ordered jailed on a $5 million cash-only bond after a prosecutor said he was a danger to the community who was accused of a \"heinous crime.\" \n \n The turn of events stunned the prominent farm family that employed him for the last four years. They said the 24-year-old worked under a different name and was a good employee who helped take care of their cows and got along with co-workers. \n \n Even after Tibbetts disappeared on July 18 while out for an evening run in the small central Iowa town of Brooklyn, Rivera kept coming to work and \"nobody saw a difference\" in his demeanor, said Dane Lang, the manager of Yarrabee Farms. His colleagues were stunned Tuesday to learn that he was not only the suspect in Tibbetts' death, but that he had a different real name than what he went by on the farm, Lang said. \n \n \"Our employee is not who he said he was,\" Lang said at a news conference at the farm. \"This was shocking to us.\" \n \n When Rivera was hired in 2014, he presented an out-of-state government-issued photo identification and a matching Social Security card, Lang said. That information was run through the Social Security Administration's employment-verification system and checked out, he said. \n \n Rivera's defense attorney, Allan Richards, acknowledged Wednesday that his client received his paycheck under a different name and that he was uncertain of his immigration status. He said he was prepared to argue that his client was in the country legally, noting that he came to the U.S. as a minor and had worked and paid taxes for years. \n \n \"He showed up every day and he did his job. He was patted on his back. They turned a blind eye to the reality of documentation,\" Richards said. \n \n Investigators say they believe Rivera abducted Tibbetts as she went on an evening jog, killed her and dumped her body in a cornfield. A judge on Wednesday agreed to increase Rivera's bond to $5 million from $1 million after prosecutor Scott Brown noted he was a potential flight risk who was charged with a \"heinous crime.\" \n \n His attorney, Richards, lashed out at President Donald Trump for publicly declaring his client guilty at a rally Tuesday night. He said his client was a hard worker with the equivalent of an eighth-grade education, had no prior criminal record and deserved the presumption of innocence and a fair trial. \n \n \"Sad and Sorry Trump has weighed in on this matter in national media which will poison the entire possible pool of jury members,\" Richards wrote in a court filing. \n \n Trump noted the arrest at the rally in West Virginia: \"You heard about today with the illegal alien coming in, very sadly, from Mexico and you saw what happened to that incredible, beautiful young woman. Should've never happened. Illegally in our country.\" \n \n Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials have lodged an immigration detainer for Rivera, a move that means the agency has probable cause to believe he is subject to deportation. No hearing has been held yet on his status. \n \n Yarrabee Farms is a small family farming operation that dates back to 1860 and has been owned for six generations by the Lang family, which is prominent in the community, farming circles and Republican politics. Dane Lang said the farm had received dozens of disturbing phone calls and messages since the employee's arrest, including threats to kill his dog and burn down his buildings. \n \n \"This is a scary situation,\" he said. \n \n His father and farm co-owner Craig Lang, a former president of the Iowa Farm Bureau who ran earlier this year for state agriculture secretary, said the farm was cooperating with investigators and had already turned over Rivera's hiring records. He said now was not the time to debate immigration but to grieve the loss of Tibbetts, who was studying psychology at the University of Iowa. \n \n Rivera led investigators Tuesday to a body believed to be Tibbetts in a cornfield about 12 miles (19 kilometers) southeast of Brooklyn, where she was last seen, police said. \n \n Rivera allegedly confessed to following her and then panicking when she threatened to call police. He told authorities that he blacked out and then dumped her bloody body in the secluded location. \n \n Investigators have not released the cause and manner of Tibbetts' death, and didn't release any information following an autopsy conducted Wednesday. \n \n Rivera's Facebook page described him as being from Guayabillo, a community of less than 500 people in the Mexican state of Guerrero. It's about a three-hour drive from the resort city of Acapulco. \n \n Investigators said they zeroed in on Rivera after obtaining footage from surveillance cameras in Brooklyn. The footage showed a Chevy Malibu connected to Rivera that was driving back and forth as Tibbetts was running in the area. The farm where he worked was just a couple miles away from that location. \n \n A conviction on first-degree murder carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole in Iowa, which does not have the death penalty. \n \n ___ \n \n Sign up for the AP's weekly newsletter showcasing our best reporting from the Midwest and Texas: http://apne.ws/2u1RMfv",

It was only Tuesday that his employers learned his real name. Cristhian Rivera, accused of killing 20-year-old University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts, used a different name associated with an out-of-state government ID and matching Social Security card when he got a job at the dairy farm through a former girlfriend in 2014, reports the Des Moines Register. When the information was run though the Social Security Administration's verification service, everything checked out, farm manager Dane Lang tells the AP. But \"our employee was not who he said he was,\" adds Lang, son of farm co-owner and prominent Republican Craig Lang. \"This was shocking to us.\" Immigration officials now suspect Rivera was in the US illegally. Per the AP, a Facebook page in his name gives his hometown as Guayabillo, Mexico, a community of less than 500. The AP adds Rivera's attorney, Allan Richards, on Wednesday said he might argue his client was here legally, saying Rivera had been in the US since he was a minor and paid taxes. But Richards did say he hadn't verified Rivera's immigration status. At a vigil at the University of Iowa where Tibbetts would've started her sophomore year on Monday, her brother had one request for the hundreds gathered: make a friend. \"You can always attribute that friendship \u2026 to my sister, and that would mean the world to her,\" he said, per the Register.",

A thousand students coming to a park to hear someone speak about someone they've never met before.\" The Des Moines Register reports more than 1,000 people attended the 20-minute vigil, which was organized by students from the University of Iowa Student Government and the University of Iowa Dance Marathon. Jake Tibbetts described his sister as \"goofy\" and \"a little clumsy\" but also as an advocate for mental health and someone who gave her the confidence to go from a high school class of 37 to a university class of thousands. \"You can always attribute that friendship you just made to my sister, and that would mean the world to her,\" he said. \"Knowing that a thousand people just made a friend tonight in her name.\" Breck Goodman, a friend of Mollie Tibbetts, said the 20-year-old's smile seemed to have an effect on people. \"Even if she was just passing on the way to class, she would smile, and you would feel some sort of comfort,\" she tells the Iowa City Press-Citizen. \"That was kind of the embodiment of Mollie.\"",

    "document": "This article is over 3 years old \n \n What do beards and toilets have in common? Fortunately, for fans of facial growth, the answer, and the good news, is nothing \n \n No need for men to get flush-faced about faeces in beards \n \n According to multiple news sites, beards can contain more poo than a toilet. Here are a few of the headlines: \n \n \u201cSome beards contain more poo than a toilet shocking study reveals\u201d \u2013 the Mirror \n \n \n \n \u201cShock new research reveals some beards contain more poo than a toilet\u201d \u2013 news.com.au \n \n \n \n \u201cSome beards are so full of poo they are as dirty as toilets\u201d \u2013 metro.co.uk \n \n \n \n I was curious to read the original study to see what the basis was for the investigation and the actual results. \n \n \n \n However, as far as I can tell there was no proper study, no team of microbiologists and no poo in beards. The origin of the story appears to be this segment from a TV news network in New Mexico, which involved a reporter swabbing a \u201chandful\u201d of men\u2019s beards and then sending the swabs to a microbiologist in a lab to culture any microbes present. \n \n \n \n The reporter then interviewed the microbiologist, John Golobic, who identified a few of the bacteria present as \u201centerics\u201d, that is they are bacteria that normally live in the intestines. \n \n \n \n \u201cThose are the types of things you\u2019d find in faeces,\u201d he said. \n \n \n \n And that\u2019s all. Somehow, from this story other media organisations have managed to get poo in beards. \n \n \n \n While it is true that human faeces are partially composed of gut bacteria, it\u2019s not accurate to describe those bacteria on their own as faeces. \n \n \n \n Further, even if this was a properly conducted scientific study with a large number of samples and published in a reputable journal, there wouldn\u2019t necessarily be any cause for concern. \n \n Human skin is home to great diversity of microbes, and it\u2019s not unheard of for types of bacteria normally found in the gut, such as E. coli, to be also found on the skin. \n \n \n \n So, if the stories aren\u2019t right, are there any actual proper studies into microbes in beards? \n \n \n \n I could only find a couple in a short amount of time, but there was one study in the journal Anaesthesia which looked at whether facial hair had any effect on the ability of surgical face masks to prevent transmission of bacteria. \n \n \n \n The study found that bearded men shed more bacteria than clean-shaven men. The study did have a relatively small sample size though, with only 10 people in each category. \n \n \n \n Another study in the Journal of Hospital Infection examined how facial hair affects the prevalence of potential pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (golden staph). \n \n \n \n It found that having a beard actually reduced the likelihood of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and S. aureus being present on the skin. It also found that hospital workers with beards shed more bacteria than those without beards, supporting the earlier study mentioned. \n \n However, the unbearded workers still shed enough bacteria to emphasise the importance of everyone wearing face coverings for sterile procedures, regardless of your facial hair situation. \n \n So in summary: there is more crap in these stories about poo in beards than there is in beards. So chaps, you can all relax. ||||| Beards are big -- literally and figuratively. \n \n A handful of brave men allowed Action 7 News to swab their beards, and the results showed some beards are as dirty as toilets. \n \n Quest Diagnostics microbiologist John Golobic tested the swabs, and the results blew his mind. \n \n \u201cI'm usually not surprised and I was surprised by this,\u201d Golobic said. \n \n Several of the beards that were tested contained a lot of normal bacteria, but some were comparable to toilets. \n \n \u201cThose are the types of things you'd find in (fecal matter),\u201d Golobic said, referring to the tests. \n \n Even though some of the bacteria won\u2019t lead to illness, Golobic said it\u2019s still a little concerning. \n \n \u201cThere would be a degree of uncleanliness that would be somewhat disturbing,\u201d Golobic said. \n \n Golobic recommends a thorough beard scrubbing and lots of hand-washing. \n \n \u201c(Also), try to keep your hands away from your face, as much as possible,\u201d he said. \n \n If the city were to find similar samples in the water system, Golobic said it would need to be shut down for disinfecting. \n \n RELATED: 7 ways to stop germs in their tracks \n \n Mobile users: Tap for video \n \n",

By happenstance or not, in the days and weeks after the meeting with the Russian lawyer, emails purloined from Democratic computers were made public, which investigators tied to Russian hacking. \n \n As a candidate, the elder Mr. Trump, who had expressed admiration of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, took positions that summer that caused head scratching. He expressed openness to lifting sanctions on Russia that were imposed after its annexation of Crimea, and suggested he might not defend NATO allies that did not spend enough money on their own security. The Republican platform at the party convention in July 2016 was crafted to keep out a call to provide arms to Ukraine to fight pro-Russian separatists. \n \n The president\u2019s legal team declined to comment about the close timing of some of these events. A White House official said the president\u2019s threat to air allegations about Mrs. Clinton on June 7 was part of a long-planned speech and was not related to his son\u2019s decision to meet with the Russian lawyer. At a briefing on Wednesday, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, dismissed the latest articles about the emails and meeting as \u201cmuch ado about nothing.\u201d \n \n Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that he was not aware of the June 2016 meeting with the Russian lawyer at the time. \u201cNo, that I didn\u2019t know until a couple of days ago when I heard about this,\u201d he told Reuters.

Absolutely not.\u2019 I then asked him a second time in a totally different way. He said absolutely not,\u201d Trump said. \n \n Asked if he believed Putin\u2019s denial, Trump paused. \n \n \u201cLook. Something happened and we have to find out what it is, because we can\u2019t allow a thing like that to happen to our election process. So something happened and we have to find out what it is,\u201d he said. \n \n About Putin, he added: \u201cSomebody did say if he did do it, you wouldn\u2019t have found out about it. Which is a very interesting point.\u201d \n \n Slideshow (3 Images) \n \n While U.S. intelligence agencies and even members of Trump\u2019s Cabinet have said Russia meddled in the election, Trump has wavered on the subject, at times suggesting that other actors might have been involved. \n \n Trump equivocated on whether he felt he could trust Putin. He said Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping both look out for their countries\u2019 interests, as he looks out for U.S. interests. \n \n \u201cI am not a person who goes around trusting lots of people. But he\u2019s the leader of Russia. It is the second most powerful nuclear power on earth. I am the leader of the United States. I love my country. He loves his country,\u201d Trump said. \n \n As in the past, Trump said there was no collusion between his campaign and Russia. \n \n \u201cThere was zero coordination. It\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve ever heard,\u201d he said. \n \n The Republican president said Democrats had used the accusations to justify Clinton\u2019s loss in November, saying: \u201cThe White House is functioning beautifully despite the hoax made up by the Democrats.\u201d \n \n Although he and Putin were able to forge a ceasefire agreement in part of Syria, Trump said their interests collided over other issues. He said his U.S. military buildup and drive to increase U.S. energy production were in direct conflict with Putin, whose nation is dependent on energy exports. \n \n Their differences made him wonder whether Putin really had supported him last year, as many news reports have suggested. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s really the one question I wish I would have asked Putin: Were you actually supporting me?\u201d",

(Associated Press) \n \n Fishing piers can be a magnet for sharks even when people aren't looking to land them because live bait is in the water and the pilings from the structure itself offer refuge for fish. There are also fish guts and blood from caught and cleaned fish that are sometimes tossed back into the water. \n \n \"That's going to attract fish and that's going to certainly attract sharks,\" North Carolina Division of Marine Fisheries Director Louis Daniel said. \"If they get into the surf zone where the water is a little muddy and cloudy and there's dead fish parts floating around and they're gobbling it up,\" the sharks can get confused and bite a person. \n \n Fishermen say they don't think they should be blamed or punished for the rare shark attacks, but local officials in Oak Island want a shark fishing ban to limit the food supply for sharks close to shore \u2014 at least through the popular Independence Day holiday weekend, town manager Tim Holloman said. It's not clear how a ban could be enforced, but could involve limiting the use of certain types of hooks, rigs and bait used for shark fishing. \n \n Experts say swimming farther away from piers is a good idea, regardless of whether a shark fishing ban is in place. At Oak Island, two young people lost limbs in separate, life-threatening shark attacks within 90 minutes of each other on Sunday. One happened in the shadow of a fishing pier. The other was 2 miles away. \n \n Both had been swimming about 20 yards offshore, in waist-deep water. \n \n Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, are among popular destinations that have outlawed shark fishing from piers to try and better protect swimmers. Towns in Florida have also considered bans. \n \n In North Carolina, it's legal to attract sharks by placing fish parts \u2014 also called chum \u2014 into a mesh laundry bag and hanging it off the side of a boat or pier, allowing the scent to attract sharks. But even without chum, virtually any structure in the water offers a place for fish to congregate, and that gives sharks a destination for hunting, said John Zardus, an associate professor of marine biology at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. \n \n \"With their sensory system, they are able to tell there is structure and they know from experience that food is in that area,\" he said. \n \n Last Sunday, Kiersten Yow, 12, of Asheboro, was swimming about 100 yards from Oak Island's Ocean Crest Pier when a shark attacked. She lost her left arm below the elbow and suffered leg injuries. Her parents said in a statement Tuesday she was in stable condition. \n \n Nearly 90 minutes later, a shark bit off the left arm above the elbow of 16-year-old Hunter Treschel of Colorado Springs, Colorado. He was in good condition Wednesday at a Wilmington hospital, spokeswoman Carolyn Fisher said. \n \n Officials do not know if they were attacked by the same shark. \n \n The Ocean Crest Pier \u2014 near where the girl was attacked \u2014 allows shark fishing only at night, but forbids floating bags of chum, manager Steve Sanders said. \n \n The town's other pier, the Oak Island Pier, is 2 miles from where the boy was attacked. That pier boasts the state's record-breaking tiger shark, a 1,150-pound monster caught there in 1966. \n \n The Oak Island Pier allows shark fishing during its open hours but doesn't allow chumming, said operator Tommy Thomes. He said town officials would have to show him some evidence his pier is imperiling swimmers by attracting sharks. \n \n \"Until we get some other support than the town's opinion, no we would not\" stop allowing shark fishing, Thomes said. \n \n Shark fishing usually involves large hooks, strong steel fishing rigs and bloody cut bait, such as the head of another large fish. \n \n It's unclear whether shark fishing bans are effective. Beth Firchau of the Virginia Aquarium and Marine Science Center said she doesn't know whether shark fishing increases the likelihood of an attack or of any marine scientists studying the bans. \n \n But, she said, \"we know that the act of fishing is all focused on attracting animals to your bait. And so if you're actively fishing in an area where people are swimming, one plus one equals two.\" \n \n Virginia has had just five attacks since 1837, with the only fatality coming when a 10-year-old boy was attacked south of Virginia Beach in 2001. After that deadly attack, Virginia Beach expanded its ban on shark fishing or chumming to include all of the city's waters to within 500 feet of shore. \n \n Only five shark bites have been reported in South Carolina waters in 2014, and there were just four in North Carolina last year, part of a gradual increase in recent years, according to the International Shark Attack File report compiled by the Florida Museum of Natural History and the University of Florida. \n \n ___ \n \n Emery Dalesio can be reached at http://twitter.com/emerydalesio. \n \n ___ \n \n Masters reported from Raleigh, North Carolina.

A 10-year-old boy was in chest-deep water at Daytona Beach Shores yesterday when he was bitten on the calf by a shark, WESH reports. Officials say the boy was treated for lacerations at the scene and didn't need to go to a hospital. He was the county's fourth shark victim of the year and the second in the space of a week: Another 10-year-old boy was severely injured last week in a shark attack at Cocoa Beach, around 60 miles south of the latest attack, NBC reports. This is the 11th attack in the state so far this year, which isn't an exceptionally high number, shark expert Dr. George Burgess tells WESH, noting that \"the number of humans that are killed by sharks versus the number of sharks killed by human beings is 10 million to one.\" He advises swimmers worried about sharks to stay in groups and avoid areas where fishermen put out bait. Two young people lost limbs in shark attacks in Oak Island, NC, on Sunday and the town is considering banning shark fishing to protect swimmers from sharks attracted by the bait, the AP reports.

The boy, who is visiting from Georgia, was bitten on the calf as he swam in chest-deep waters and was treated at the scene by a lifeguard before being taken to a hospital without having to go to a hospital, a spokeswoman for Volusia County Beach Safety/Ocean Rescue tells NBC.

The director of the Florida program for shark research tells NBC that while the number of shark attacks in the US may appear to be on the rise, \"we will be seeing more shark attacks in years ahead because there's more of us. We're simply flooding sharks out of their own environment.\" He says the best way to avoid being a victim is to stay in groups while in the water and not to swim near the inlet where many other are putting out bait while fishing.",

At the time, the child's father, Mark Nunes, had full custody rights because of allegations of mistreatment, according to the Marshals Service. \n \n Marshals were involved in efforts spanning the United States, Canada and Central and South America to locate Mary Nunes and Genevieve and Scott Kelley. \n \n Genevieve Kelley was featured as the U.S. Marshals Service \"Fugitive of the Week\" in New Hampshire, coinciding with the nationally televised story of Mary Nunes and her kidnappers aired on \"The Hunt,\" which is hosted by John Walsh. \n \n After Genevieve Kelley surrendered Monday, U.S. Marshal David Cargill Jr., \"I am happy that (she) is in custody and will face justice for these charges, but we will all be the happiest, when we know Mary Nunes is safe.\" \n \n Scott Kelley is considered a fugitive and is being sought, the Marshals Service said in a news release. \n \n Cargill credited the media and investigators for providing the \"push needed to get Genevieve Kelley to surrender.\" \n \n In March, Genevieve Kelley informed the New Hampshire prosecutor through her attorney that she wanted to negotiate her surrender. \n \n Kelley is in the custody of the Coos County Sheriff's Office and has made an initial court appearance. \n \n Breaks in other 'Hunt' cases \n \n Kelley's arrest came the same day authorities in Texas announced that in an unrelated case, remains found in September were confirmed to be those of another fugitive, Kevin Patrick Stoeser , also featured on CNN's \"The Hunt.\" \n \n Stoeser, a U.S. soldier who was dishonorably discharged, pleaded guilty in 2003 to child sexual assault and child pornography charges and was sentenced to 13 years behind bars. \n \n Authorities said Monday it's unclear when or how he died. No other remains were found, they said. \n \n Remains of another suspect featured on the \"The Hunt\" were also found earlier this year, and another suspect who was profiled on the show was killed in a gun battle with authorities. \n \n In August, the remains of Shane Miller were found in California. Miller was the prime suspect in the deaths of his wife and two young daughters. ||||| CONCORD, N.H. - Mark Nunes fondly remembers the last days he spent with his daughter Mary. \n \n Seven years old at the time, Mary had traveled from New Hampshire to spend a week with Mark, his new wife and their two children in northern Virginia. It was August 2003, and they camped and went to the zoo and a water park. \n \n Mark, 46, a pediatrician, was about to start a new job and buy a house, partly in hopes that Mary, who lived with his ex-wife, could begin spending more time with his family. \n \n \"I remember Mary picking out her room,\" he recalls. \"It was very sweet.\" \n \n But the sweetness was not to last. Their next scheduled visit, two months later, was abruptly canceled, and a year after that, Mary simply vanished. \n \n Her disappearance with her mother and stepfather was the climax of a long, acrimonious tug of war over the child. The pair, Genevieve Kelley, 45, a family practice physician, and Scott Kelley, 44, a special-education teacher, are wanted by the U.S. Marshals Service on federal warrants for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. \n \n Bitter divorces in which children become pawns are not rare, and they often include a steady stream of complaints about parental conduct ranging from frivolous to felonious. But after serving as Mary's court-appointed advocate while Genevieve and Mark battled in court during this one, guardian ad litem Abbie Teachout leaves no doubt where she stands. \n \n \"She (Genevieve) appeared to be really, almost obsessed in her concern over Mary and that Mark had done something\" to harm the child, said Teachout, who, like police investigators, found no evidence to support the mother's complaints. \"Out of all the families I've worked with, this was a case where parent alienation was 100 percent evident - that Genevieve was doing everything she could to alienate this child from her father, from the beginning.\" \n \n Genevieve Kelley's family says concern for her child motivated her actions. \n \n Mary is now 13. A forensic artist's image of how she might look today is on the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's Web site. \n \n Looking at it brings a sad realization to her father: \"That my daughter's a teenager right now...\" \n \n In his mind, she's forever stuck at 7. \n \n --- \n \n The couple met and married in the Air Force: Genevieve San Martin was a flight surgeon. Mark Nunes was specializing in genetics. They planned to have children and settle down. Mary was born in 1996. \n \n But arguments over money and military-imposed separations eventually led Genevieve to move back to Whitefield, N.H., near her parents, and file for divorce. She got a restraining order against Mark, saying she was afraid of him. He said the worst thing he ever did was slam a door once during an argument. \n \n \"I very naively went into the entire process trying to save my marriage,\" he said. \n \n The divorce was granted in 1998 on grounds of irreconcilable differences. Genevieve had primary custody of Mary; Mark traveled from Biloxi, Miss., for monthly, long weekend-type visits. The two eventually married others, but when it came to Mary's care, the arguments never ended. \n \n Genevieve complained to Teachout that Mary was starved during Mark's visits; he said that was impossible. She said Mary, who was born prematurely, had developmental delays; he disagreed. \n \n Teachout recalls one visit she made to Genevieve's house: \n \n \"Mary was crawling and on her way to walking ... the whole living room was covered in blankets and pillows and every time this baby would go to move, someone would be there hanging onto her. And I had concerns at that point that this baby wasn't going to be able to develop appropriately if you didn't let her go.\" \n \n As Mary grew, Genevieve and Mark communicated through a notebook Mary brought with her on flights to Mississippi. If Mark wanted to call Mary, he had to reach her at assigned times - and the calls weren't always answered or returned. \n \n In October 2003, as Mark was getting ready to fly up to see his daughter, the visit was canceled. Based on what Genevieve said were Mary's words and actions, she told police that Mark had sexually abused the child. \n \n He said he had wondered \"when the sexual abuse card was going to be played. ... I was supposed to disappear.\" \n \n He was never charged and was cleared a year later by police and state investigators who felt he had been unfairly accused. \n \n The state Division of Children, Youth and Families interviewed Mary. \"There wasn't information that gave us reason to believe that this child had been harmed by her father or anyone else, for that matter,\" said Lorraine Bartlett, the division's child protection administrator. The agency provided information about the case to The Associated Press only after getting permission from Mark. \n \n The child underwent a court-approved evaluation at a clinic in Portland, Maine. The family moved in 2004 to Colorado, where Mary was evaluated by two doctors. \n \n At one point, Genevieve gave authorities homemade videotapes of Mary to support her case. (Family members quoted Scott as saying a counselor treating Mary suggested they make the tapes.) \n \n \"It was an extraordinarily disturbing tape,\" Mark said, noting his daughter sometimes screamed and hid from the camera. Child welfare workers, police and prosecutors said the tape showed leading conduct on Genevieve's part. \n \n \"Clearly Mom was interfering with and providing information to the child and how she was questioning her, leading her to certain statements, literally making statements, This is what happened, yes? Daddy did this, right?' ... We would never be able to go forward with any of this,\" Bartlett said. \n \n The clinic evaluating Mary also \"raised some concern\" about the mother's role, Bartlett said. \"Is Mom contributing to some of the anxiety and some of these other things being said by this child?\" \n \n Wayne Rioux, who was Whitefield police chief at the time, said the Kelleys were trying to indoctrinate Mary \"into not only hating her father but trying to make her say things against her father.\" \n \n In the fall of 2004, a judge ordered Mary brought to Bartlett's agency in advance of a scheduled evaluation at the clinic. But mother and child never showed up. By the end of November, authorities discovered that Mary, now 8, hadn't attended school in Colorado for at least a month, and the family's mail was undeliverable. \n \n That December, Mark was given legal custody of Mary. In 2005, the Kelleys were indicted on a charge of interference with custody. \n \n --- \n \n Beth Kelley, Scott's sister, said Genevieve was doing everything she could to help her daughter and wasn't sure whom she could trust anymore. \n \n \"I think they absolutely realized that when they left that they would be probably not coming back at all,\" Beth said. \"I'm sure that it was the worst decision that the two of them ever had to make in their entire lives. But they had to do it for Mary's sake if there was even a chance that she was going to have to see her father again.\" \n \n Beth had befriended Genevieve at a health care practice where they worked and introduced her to Scott. The two, both divorced, hit it off and got married at a drive-by chapel in Las Vegas, Beth said. \n \n Sometimes her brother's family missed family get-togethers, saying Mary was having behavioral problems, Beth said. \n \n A counselor in Concord treated Mary for post-traumatic stress disorder, Beth said. She quoted her brother as saying Mary seemed to be doing much better after she saw the doctors in Colorado. \n \n \"Mother was really like a ship without a rudder trying to find the best way she could to support her child,\" one of the Colorado psychiatrists, Dr. Ron Minson, testified at a hearing in October 2004. He agreed that something had traumatized Mary, but declined to comment about whether she had been abused. \n \n Family members have not heard from Scott, Genevieve and Mary, Beth said. \"We prefer to picture them sitting on a beach holding a drink with an umbrella in it,\" she said. \n \n Genevieve's parents, George and Regina San Martin, also have not heard from their daughter since she disappeared, said John McKinnon, their attorney. \"There's nothing. There's been not one communication, there's been not one postcard, one letter,\" he said. \n \n A police search of their home in 2005 turned up years of stored utility bills, yet no phone records; the San Martins said they shred the phone bills. \n \n Several thousand dollars' worth of travelers cheques were found in Mrs. San Martin's purse, and she said she used them to pay bills, according to former Whitefield Police Sgt. Shawn White, who conducted the search. The San Martins' computer showed they were researching real estate in Texas, and White said Mrs. San Martin had asked him if her daughter was stopped in Texas whether she would be brought back to New Hampshire. He advised that she would. \n \n The couple declined to be interviewed for this story. \n \n --- \n \n Marshals investigating the Kelleys' 2004 disappearance have received help from the U.S. State Department, Interpol and other agencies. \n \n The family could be living in the United States. But the marshals say they initially went to Central America and were in at least two countries there. Genevieve, who speaks fluent Spanish and had lived in Spain, used to travel to the region with Mark. \n \n \"She could blend right in,\" said Deputy U.S. Marshal William Marr. \n \n The marshals put out an alert to traveling emergency medical service workers about a condition Mary has - arteriovenous malformation - marked by seizures, headaches, bleeding and other symptoms. They've followed Internet leads, even reaching out to a Web site that looks for stolen horses; two horses Mary used to ride vanished, too. \n \n Mark Nunes would like to know where his teenage daughter is. He keeps pictures of the younger Mary on his mantel. His 8-year-old son, now older than Mary was when Mark last saw her, sometimes asks about her. Mark also has a 5-year-old daughter and once hoped the children would make a difference in each other's lives. \n \n \"That's gone. That's shattered,\" he said. \n \n --- \n \n On the Net: \n \n www.usmarshals.gov/district/nh/fugitives/index.html \n \n www.amw.com/missing-children/brief.cfm?id \n \n 44005 \n \n www.missingkids.com/ ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

(AP) \u2014 A woman who fled with her 8-year-old daughter a decade ago during a custody dispute turned herself in Monday to face trial. \n \n Genevieve Kelley of Whitefield disappeared with her daughter, Mary, into Central America in the fall of 2004 after her attempt to prove her ex-husband had harmed the child backfired. \n \n The U.S. Marshals Service investigated numerous tips through the years. Shortly after her daughter turned 18 in February and was no longer subject to the family court, Kelley, 50, made contact. Her lawyer said she wanted to face a jury on her custodial interference charge. She said her daughter is safe. \n \n Police felt Kelley's ex-husband, Mark Nunes, was unfairly accused. He was never charged with a crime. \n \n Kelley turned herself in Monday in Lancaster, New Hampshire, and was arrested, Deputy U.S. Marshal Jamie Berry said. He said her lawyer and Coos County Attorney John McCormick were arguing bail. \n \n Mark Nunes hasn't given up hope of being reunited with his daughter and hopes to learn more about her. \n \n \"Is she alive? Is she safe?\" he said Monday. \n \n It wasn't immediately known if Mary Nunes was in the courtroom. In an interview last week, Kelley's lawyer, Alan Rosenfeld, said his client would likely appear on her own first. \n \n \"She wants to be vindicated,\" Alan Rosenfeld said. \"She wants a trial.\" \n \n Rosenfeld, a Colorado attorney who specializes in child advocacy and domestic violence cases, had asked prosecutor McCormick twice this year if he would agree to recommend to a judge that Kelley voluntarily return and not be jailed unless she is convicted. He said she would not be a flight risk, but McCormick disagreed, noting she left in the middle of a family court proceeding in 2004. \n \n \"She fears there's a chance she'll be held, a fear that's probably well founded,\" McCormick had said. \n \n Rosenfeld had said if things didn't work out, \"she's just going to show up unannounced one day.\" \n \n Mary Nunes, presumably, would be a witness at the trial, he said. \n \n \"She was old enough to know what was going on,\" he said. \n \n Mary was 7 when her father last saw her. \n \n \"I am happy that Genevieve Kelly is in custody and will face justice for these charges, but we will all be the happiest, when we know Mary Nunes is safe,\" U.S. Marshal David Cargill Jr. said. \n \n In an emailed statement, Nunes said he is heartbroken about his daughter. \n \n \"We want to say publicly that we as Mary's family love her, look forward to her coming home and to keep an open mind as we believe that she has been told falsehoods and misstatements on the events of her youth,\" he said.",

A day after the temblor, inspectors had deemed 70 buildings here uninhabitable. The number of people treated for injuries had risen to 208, and schools remained closed. But residents and outsiders alike had found a common calling. \n \n \"When you meet people who are helping each other, there's no difference between religions or between colors,\" said Premysl Balaz, a 33-year-old engineer from the Czech Republic who was a week into a San Francisco vacation when the earthquake hit. \n \n He drove up, found the temporary volunteer center, and was dispatched Monday to help build a database of red-tagged homes. \n \n \"Everyone is connected through the idea that they want to help,\" Balaz said. \"I love the energy about it.\" \n \n It didn't take long for the helpers to amass. \n \n At Grace Church of Napa Valley on Sunday morning, congregants prayed and then made a list. Up top was a couple whose home sits directly on the fault. \n \n After the earth split, Tim and Ann Whitlock's two-story house ended up six inches in front of its foundation. Big cracks zigzagged up the interior walls, and the sidewalk buckled into the shape of a tepee. \n \n Throughout the day, fellow congregants \u2014 about 100 of them \u2014 helped pack everything into boxes and big plastic containers. \n \n \"Who says you can't move in six hours?\" said Ann Whitlock. \n \n Across town, Patricia Trimble was wading through a mess of broken pottery and glass at the Roost, her downtown vintage store, when a stranger walked in. \n \n \"He said he was drawn to me. He quoted Yeats,\" Trimble said of Marc Liotta, a Walnut Creek contractor with a near-addiction to reaching out to strangers. Liotta picked up the bags of debris and tossed them in the bed of his silver Toyota Tundra for a courtesy run to the dump. \n \n \"And you know what he did then?\" Trimble said Monday as she listened to the melancholy sounds of Rickie Lee Jones in her quickly shaping-up boutique. \"He went to my house and offered his help there.\" \n \n Liotta, whose card reads \"The Closet Magician,\" is semi-retired. In addition to building closet organizing systems, he has volunteered for Habitat for Humanity (as has Trimble) and flown to Haiti to offer his assistance after the earthquake. \n \n \"I was sort of languishing around here watching television and said, 'I'm gonna just go up there,'\" said Liotta, 69, who was tipped off to Trimble's plight by the plywood on her window. \n \n By Monday morning, more help arrived. At the volunteer center in the Grace church gym, Gregg DesElms welcomed a woman who said she'd taken the day off work. \n \n He started to explain that he didn't have anywhere to send her or Balaz, the visiting engineer. Then DesElms' cellphone rang. \n \n \"Yes,\" he said. \"I have two people here right now, and they're ready to go.\" \n \n He hung up and turned to Balaz. \n \n \"How's your English and your typing?\" he asked. \n \n \"So-so,\" Balaz said. \n \n The police chief needed help entering numbers and addresses of red-tagged structures. \n \n \"Oh, I'm good with numbers,\" Balaz said, smiling. \"I'm in, I'm in.\" \n \n By afternoon, \"Cartoon\" Danny Roszell was offering his services to merchants. He tends to travel with a broom, though he insists he is no witch, but \"a leprechaun incarnate.\" A window painter by trade, the Berkeley resident had come to Napa 10 days ago to help a friend with her house and look for gigs adorning glass with images of the grape harvest. \n \n After the quake, he decided to put his broom to use. He showed up downtown in a white wool top hat adorned with a live flower bouquet. \n \n \"It's what I do,\" he said, of his sweeping habit. \"It's a kind of meditation.\" \n \n A few blocks away, Rod Wieldraayer was hauling free materials from the Napa Home Depot store to about 60 volunteers as they hopscotched through town. \n \n Wieldraayer, the store manager, also happens to live here. The company often organizes its workers in small volunteer armies, so Monday's massive mobilization came naturally. \n \n The bed of his truck was already loaded with a stack of plywood, crates of water and garbage bags when his cellphone rang. It was his district manager. \n \n \"Boxes? Medium boxes?\" Wieldraayer said. \"I'm on it.\" \n \n A family with a red-tagged home needed them, so Wieldraayer returned to the store to fetch them and renew his supply of angle brackets, for residents now scrambling to secure their heavy furniture to the wall. \n \n Meanwhile, in the Browns Valley neighborhood, where Lemieux lives, the crew was moving street to street. \n \n Within no time, they had re-stacked a tumbled-down wood pile, hauled off debris from two other fallen chimneys, and disassembled a hulking planter once built onto Darcie Blair's front porch. \n \n Blair, 45, a single mother with a 4-year-old daughter, lived in Northridge when the big quake struck there in 1994, but said she never felt anywhere close to the support she is getting in Napa. Within minutes of their departure, she had posted pictures of the Home Depot helpers on Facebook. \n \n \"The kindness of strangers just keeps on amazing me,\" she wrote. \"As my daughter and I continue to clean up here in Napa, the folks from Home Depot just completely dismantled and hauled away for free a large part of our front porch. \n \n \"Thank you, good neighbors.

The earthquake's epicenter was a few miles south of Napa Valley's renowned wineries, and the quake busted barrels and bottles of precious vintages. More than 170 people were injured, and 100 homes are now uninhabitable, the state Office of Emergency Services said Sunday. \n \n In the first uncertain minutes, a seismologist at the U.S Geological Survey's Bay Area headquarters pinned the blame on the Franklin Fault, which has been inactive for thousands of years. \n \n By morning, the sun lay bare what darkness hid: Buckled pavement and cracked curbs lined up along the West Napa Fault for up to 10 miles (16 kilometers). After inspecting the damage, California state geologist John Parrish declared that Sunday's earthquake occurred on the West Napa Fault, not the Franklin Fault. The USGS concurred, tweeting Sunday that the Browns Valley section of the West Napa Fault was the likely culprit. [See photos of damage from the Napa earthquake] \n \n The results are still preliminary, and geologists will make a definitive call in the next few days. However, the early false start highlights how both high-tech instruments and old-fashioned groundwork remain important in the aftermath of an earthquake. \n \n Which fault? \n \n Yesterday's earthquake struck near the Napa Airport, in the San Pablo Bay marshes. The USGS precisely located the epicenter in just a few minutes, thanks to the region's dense seismic monitoring network, said Tom Brocher, director of the USGS Earthquake Science Center in Menlo Park, California. But which fault was at fault? \n \n Many suspects appear on state earthquake maps. One is the West Napa Fault, which stretches 35 miles (57 km) from the city of St. Helena south to San Pablo Bay, according to a USGS report published in 2008. Among a handful of other possibilities, the Franklin Fault also stands out. This fault begins near the epicenter of the recent quake, and then cuts south across San Pablo Bay. \n \n West Napa or Franklin? That 4 a.m. guess blaming the Franklin Fault soon seemed wrong. As damage reports poured in, scientists zeroed in on the West Napa Fault's Browns Valley branch. \n \n This fault traces the western margin of the Napa Valley and cuts through the Browns Valley neighborhood of Napa. Along with the damaged streets, many of the city's water main breaks were in the Browns Valley area, according to Napa Valley officials. The Browns Valley branch pierces the Napa River at Cuttings Wharf. Another strand of the West Napa Fault lies east of the river and runs through the Napa Airport. \n \n Map of Napa Valley region faults. Credit: USGS \n \n Why it happened \n \n The West Napa Fault is part of the huge fault zone extending outward from the San Andreas Fault, which lies about 31 miles (50 km) west of Napa Valley. The San Andreas marks the boundary where the Pacific and North American tectonic plates grind past one another. The West Napa Fault is sandwiched between two larger faults: the Hayward-Rodgers Creek Fault and the Concord-Green Valley Fault. [Photo Journal: The Gorgeous San Andreas Fault] \n \n \"The plate boundary is really quite wide and quite complicated, and the plate motion is accommodated by a wide network of faults,\" Brocher told Live Science. \n \n The tectonic tension between the plates trickles inland to the West Napa Fault. An earthquake occurs when this built-up strain is unleashed. The fault parallels the San Andreas, and like the San Andreas, it is a series of slashes in the earth, not a single crack. (Each fault has more than one segment running in parallel.) Each fault is also of a type called right-lateral strike-slip, which means one side of the fault leaps horizontally to the right during an earthquake. \n \n Within the last 11,000 years, the West Napa Fault has created cliffs and ridges called scarps, a sign of past seismic activity. But this fault has never jolted valley residents in historic times. \n \n The last earthquake to rattle the Napa Valley struck on Sept. 3, 2000. This magnitude-5.1 earthquake occurred 10 miles (16 km) northwest of Napa, near Yountville, on a previously unknown fault. \n \n No one knows how often earthquakes rumble through Napa Valley. The West Napa Fault and others nearby have never received the detailed detective work that geologists lavish on faults in the densely settled Bay Area. A 2008 estimate of Bay Area earthquake probabilities conducted by scientists and engineers for the state of California did not include the West Napa Fault. \n \n \"It is known to be an active fault, but it certainly has not been viewed as one of the major players in the Bay Area,\" Brocher said. \n \n Napa's 6.0-magnitude earthquake is the biggest quake in California since the magnitude-6.7 Northridge earthquake in 1994, and the biggest in Northern California since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake, a magnitude 6.9. \n \n Collecting clues \n \n But the South Napa earthquake could have been worse. Only part of the West Napa Fault broke open. If the entire fault had ripped, the earthquake would have been more powerful. \n \n \"I have to say, as much as the earthquake was large and had a widespread impact, it's not as bad as it could have been,\" Mark Ghilarducci, director of California's Office of Emergency Services, said during a press conference Sunday. \n \n Though the actual earthquake rupture only lasted four seconds, there was strong shaking in Napa because the valley floor is lined with soft river soils that amplify earthquake waves. Also, the fault zipped open from south to north, directing the earthquake energy toward the city. \"It looks like it went northwest and up from the dot on the map that shows where the earthquake nucleated,\" Brocher said. [13 Crazy Earthquake Facts] \n \n Early Sunday morning, geologists from the USGS, the California Geological Survey and local universities were recording the surface damage before road crews started their repairs. This information will help researchers understand the earthquake's progress during the brief seconds the fault opened and closed. \n \n On the high-tech side, it will take a few more days to measure how much the valley moved during and after the earthquake, using GPS and satellite measurements. An initial GPS report indicated 4 inches (10 centimeters) of shift near the earthquake's epicenter, Brocher said. \n \n Small earthquakes called aftershocks continue to strike along the West Napa Fault. These small quakes cluster along the fault zone and illuminate the hidden underground parts of the fault, and will help scientists nail down which fault caused the quake. \n \n \"The locations of the aftershocks indicate that it ruptured the West Napa Fault, but it is not clear yet which strand of that fault broke,\" said Felix Waldhauser, a seismologist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in Palisades, New York. \"Over the next couple of days we should have a better picture.\" \n \n The earthquake is likely to bring new focus to Napa Valley's earthquake hazard. The California Geological Survey had already begun new studies on the Browns Valley branch earlier this year, and more researchers will likely begin studies analyzing the earthquake and its causes. \n \n The quake also highlighted the most forward-reaching technology in California's quake arsenal. \n \n The first jolt triggered the prototype earthquake early warning system at the University of California, Berkeley's Seismological Laboratory. The lab received a 10-second warning before the shaking started, said Lab Director Richard Allen. The warning could have been improved with an upgrade to the ShakeAlert system, which would have boosted the response time of the slowest seismometer by 2.5 seconds, Allen said. The state legislature approved a bill to expand the system statewide in 2013, but the Office of Emergency Services must find $80 million to pay for it. \n \n \"While the system clearly worked, the warning could have been twice as fast,\" Allen said. \n \n Email Becky Oskin or follow her @beckyoskin.

But they faced challenges that will stretch into the days and weeks ahead. \n \n Dozens of houses and businesses in Napa and Vallejo were red-tagged as uninhabitable, their walls or roofs deemed too fragile. \n \n Hundreds of homes had no water, with some people dipping into pools to flush toilets. \n \n Public schools were shut down and were to remain closed Tuesday - a summer break extended for the wrong reasons. \n \n And more than 250 people were recovering from injuries that included broken bones and concussions. \n \n But there was also reason to rejoice, or at least feel some relief, for many who call the area home. The two people who officials said were most seriously injured in the earthquake - including a 13-year-old Napa boy struck by a crumbling chimney - were said to be improving and were expected to survive. \n \n In some ways, it seemed like business as usual Monday for one of the nation's top tourist destinations - including in hard-hit downtown Napa. Even as trucks hauled off trash and rubble, nearby wineries served up tastes of their world-famous Cabernet Sauvignons, tourists streamed into the city center to eat and see the sights, and many locals went to work. \n \n \"Compared to what it could have been, it doesn't feel like a pain at all,\" said Joanne Strickland, 47, owner of Legends and Lore Gift Shop, whose worst damage came when emergency sprinklers drenched her carpets. \"I feel blessed. I am so fortunate.\" \n \n Still, it wasn't the same - and it may be a while until it is - for many people reeling from the worst earthquake to hit the Bay Area since Loma Prieta in 1989. \n \n That much was clear from the damage totals, which prompted Gov. Jerry Brown to declare a state of emergency for Napa, Solano and Sonoma counties, paving the way for engineers and architects to arrive to help in the recovery. The U.S. Geological Survey estimated the damage from the 3:20 a.m. magnitude 6.0 quake could cost $1 billion or more. \n \n As of Monday evening, inspectors had red-tagged 70 buildings in Napa, including the historic county courthouse downtown and a senior center, as too dangerous to enter. A few streets remained closed to keep people away from precarious structures, while a damaged pedestrian bridge was roped off for repairs. \n \n Some displaced residents had nowhere to go, taking shelter at a Red Cross evacuation center at the Crosswalk Community Church. \n \n In Vallejo, 10 buildings had been red-tagged, including a post office on Santa Clara Street. Vallejo officials said they had recorded 49 injuries, with two people admitted to the hospital. \n \n Among those cleaning up was Napa resident Richard Webb, 67. Webb, who was awaiting a visit from city inspectors Monday, hoped he would be given the green light to rebuild. \n \n \"This one felt like someone picked up my house 15 feet and dropped it,\" said Webb as he surveyed damage to his chimney, which toppled and spilled bricks across his front yard. \n \n Water remained a big issue Monday. Some 600 properties remained without it in Napa, as workers scrambled to repair about 90 pipeline breaks. Officials said it could take three or four days to fully restore service. \n \n Some residents resorted to using water from swimming pools to flush toilets. Among those were the 280 residents of the Napa Valley Mobile Home Park, where a water main break had made it hard for firefighters to control a blaze that destroyed six units. \n \n Residents used a jury-rigged pump to suck water out of the pool, filling buckets that they hauled home and poured into the toilet. \n \n Napa officials said those who maintained pressure after the earthquake could safely drink their tap water. But they recommended that anyone who lost service for any period of time buy bottled water for cooking or drinking, boil tap water for a full minute before consumption, or stop by one of two water stations with containers. \n \n Resident Carol Caie, 66, was one of those who filled up at a community center. \n \n \"I got some dishes on the counter,\" Caie said. \"Nothing is washed.\" \n \n Schools were another area of recovery. In Napa, all public schools were closed Monday and were scheduled to remain closed Tuesday to give administrators more time to survey damage. About two-thirds of school facilities had cleared inspections, officials said. \n \n Desiree Buckley, 32, said she will take her daughter to the park or the library Tuesday. The city also set up a youth drop-in program, which will open Tuesday at a community center. \"It's pretty hard,\" Buckley said as her 9-year-old, Haylee Mock, fidgeted on a bench. \"The kids have nothing to do and nowhere to go.\" \n \n Haylee, though, said she was happy to be out of school - her class is studying division. \n \n There was hopeful news Monday from the family of Nicholas Dillon, the 13-year-old Napa boy injured by a falling chimney at his home. His family said he was stabilized at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento after a nine-hour surgery to treat pelvic fractures. \n \n Dillon had invited a friend to spend the night Saturday and was sleeping on a mattress on his living room floor - his friend was on the couch - when the temblor struck. \n \n Family members said Nicholas felt the jolt of the quake, heard the fireplace crumbling above him and lunged to get away - just enough to avoid being fatally crushed. His friend was not injured. \n \n \"It's a blessing that he was able to spring out of the way,\" said his aunt, Carmen Rosales. \n \n On Monday, Nicholas was following his own story in the media and was, like any teenager, getting a kick out of it. He agreed to a bedside interview but then ran a fever and didn't feel well enough. \n \n He won't fully recover for several months, said Rosales, and he'll be in a wheelchair for a while. \n \n Another badly injured patient remained in critical condition Monday at Queen of the Valley Medical Center in Napa, but hospital officials said the person was expected to survive. \n \n The waiting area for the emergency room, though, was empty after the hospital treated 208 patients on Sunday. Seventeen people had been admitted with serious injuries, including broken bones. \n \n A Napa woman died at the hospital Sunday, but hospital officials said they do not believe the death was related to the earthquake. \n \n All over Napa on Monday, people took stock of the damage. Brad Alexander, a spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Services, said he expected that help would remain in the community for some time. \n \n \"With a major earthquake, you're talking about a process that is months long,\" Alexander said, noting the long recoveries that followed the Loma Prieta earthquake and Southern California's Northridge shaker five years later. \"Those earthquakes impacted us for decades.\" \n \n For most homes and businesses, though, there was little to no damage - other than fallen knickknacks and furniture moved out of place. \n \n If it weren't for the sheet of plywood across the window of the Alexis Baking Co. downtown, evidence of the earthquake would be tough to find. \n \n Tourists and locals lined up for coffee and potato buns. This being Napa, customers asked the typical questions, such as: Is the food local? \n \n \"That's California,\" said cashier Terry Washburn after describing the lemon ricotta to a group from New York. \"Food and earthquakes. I could do without the earthquakes, though.\" \n \n Chronicle staff writers Kurtis Alexander and Melody Gutierrez contributed to this report. ||||| Video \n \n NAPA, Calif. \u2014 The gardens at the Hess Collection, one of this region\u2019s better-known wineries, reeked of spilled cabernet on Monday. The wine barrel storage warehouses by the airport were a jumble of tumbled oak barrels. The wine library at Saintsbury \u2014 a room filled with old vintages \u2014 had the smell of a day-old party, a result of 500 bottles shattering on the floor. \n \n The magnitude-6 earthquake that jolted this picturesque valley of wineries and vineyards early Sunday morning wreaked at least some havoc with the industry that has come to define this part of Northern California. \u201cAbout 15,000 cases of lovely cabernet came pouring out those doors and down the steps, into the garden,\u201d said Jim Caudill, director of hospitality at the Hess Collection winery in Napa. \n \n But as winemakers and tourism officials began cleaning up and assessing the damage, there was evidence that the impact may not have been as widespread as suggested by the images that flooded Twitter and television screens. \n \n As is often the case with earthquakes, the amount of shaking \u2014 and thus damage \u2014 can vary significantly within a few square miles. This was certainly true here in wine country, where there were drastically different, and sometimes conflicting, reports of damage from vineyard to vineyard on Monday. In many cases, wine had just been moved from oak or metal barrels, where the earthquake could cause the most spillage, to bottles stacked in cases protected by shrink-wrap. \n \n Bruce Cohn, an owner of B.

Cohn Winery, said he was at first disheartened when employees reported that his warehouse \u2014 which holds 5,000 barrels, some stacked six high \u2014 was in chaos, with wine spilled all over the floors. \u201cI\u2019ve been in this for 40 years, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d Mr. Cohn said, describing the tumbled bottles and spilled wine. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n But as he reviewed the actual damage, he said, his worries began to diminish. \n \n \u201cMy feeling is that it\u2019s not that bad,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of the barrels fell over, but I\u2019m not sure they broke. I\u2019m hoping \u2014 and I think \u2014 it looks a lot worse than it is, but we don\u2019t know until we sift through it.\u201d \n \n At Saintsbury, a winery that makes about 30,000 cases a year, most of the damage was in and around a tin-roofed barn. Barrels stacked 16 feet high were knocked from a tight lattice into uneven piles that workers spent Sunday and Monday examining. Stainless steel tanks shifted a foot or more during the earthquake, but fortunately for the company, the tanks and barrels were empty: About a week ago, the company bottled and moved most of its inventory to Napa-area warehouses that were unaffected by the earthquake.",

(Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. employers notched another solid month of hiring in March by adding 215,000 jobs, driven by large gains in the construction, retail and health care industries. \n \n Despite the jump, the Labor Department said Friday that the unemployment rate ticked up to 5 percent from 4.9 percent. But that increase includes some good news: more Americans came off the sidelines to look for work, though not all found jobs. \n \n The figures suggest that employers remain confident enough in their business prospects to add staff, even as overall growth has slowed since last winter. Many analysts estimate that the economy grew at a 1 percent annual rate or below in the first quarter. Continuing job gains indicate that employers may see the slowdown as temporary. \n \n Steady hiring is also contributing to higher pay, which rose a modest 2.3 percent from a year earlier to $25.43. That figure has increased since the early years of the recovery, but is below a peak of 2.6 percent reached in December. \n \n Sluggish wage growth has been a weak spot in the economy and a source of frustration for many workers since the Great Recession ended in 2009. Paychecks typically grow at a 3.5 percent pace in a strong economy. \n \n Construction firms added 37,000 jobs, likely aided by warmer weather. That helped offset another month of job losses in manufacturing, which has been hit by slower growth overseas, and mining, which includes the oil and gas drilling sector. Low oil prices have cost that industry 185,000 since September 2014. \n \n More jobs can help fuel consumer spending, which is a critical source of growth this year. Other potential drivers of the economy, such as exports and business investment, have weakened. \n \n Consumer spending has faltered since last winter after healthy gains in 2015. Spending ticked up just 0.1 percent in February for the third month in a row. That tepid trend caused many economists to slash their growth forecasts. \n \n Americans appear to be pocketing much of their savings from lower gas prices rather than spending them. The savings rate rose to 5.4 percent in February, the highest in a year. \n \n Other economic data has been unusually mixed. Several reports suggest that manufacturers may be stabilizing after a difficult 2015, when weak overseas growth and the strong dollar hurt production. \n \n Americans have pulled back a bit from home-buying. Sales of existing homes fell a sharp 7.1 percent in February, held back by a lack of available supply that has pushed up prices. ||||| It was that time again, folks.

Pepsi... (Associated Press) \n \n NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Pepsi on Wednesday pulled an ad after it was widely mocked and criticized for appearing to trivialize protests for social justice causes. \n \n \"Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding,\" the company said. \"Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize.\" \n \n It said it was \"removing the content and halting any further rollout.\" \n \n The ad shows Kendall Jenner, a member of the \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" reality TV family, stepping away from a modeling shoot to join a crowd of smiling, young protesters. The protesters cheer after Jenner hands a can of Pepsi to a police officer, who takes a sip. \n \n PepsiCo Inc. had previously said the ad was created by its in-house team and that it would \"be seen globally across TV and digital\" platforms. \n \n It initially described the spot as featuring \"multiple lives, stories and emotional connections that show passion, joy, unbound and uninhibited moments. No matter the occasion, big or small, these are the moments that make us feel alive.\" That description was also derided on social media. \n \n The Purchase, New York, company had stood by the ad late Tuesday. By Wednesday, it was apologizing to Jenner for putting her \"in this position.\" \n \n Critics say the image of Jenner handing the officer a Pepsi evoked a photo of Black Lives Matter protester Ieshia Evans approaching an officer at a demonstration in Baton Rouge last year. Others criticized the protesters' signs for being comically innocuous, with messages like \"Join the Conversation\" and heart and peace signs. The website Gothamist expressed a common sentiment online in calling the ad \"gloriously tone-deaf.\" \n \n Among those mocking the ad was Bernice King, who tweeted a photo of her father, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., being confronted by a police officer at a protest march. \"If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi,\" the tweet said. \n \n Larry Chiagouris, a professor of marketing at Pace University, said that the backlash was in part because Pepsi was a couple years \"late to the party\" with its message about unity, making its ad seem exploitive. \n \n Still, he also noted that the fallout wouldn't necessarily be that damaging, since a lot of the negative sentiment expressed on social media is \"easily washed away overnight.\" \n \n It isn't the first time PepsiCo has backpedaled and apologized for an ad. In 2013, it pulled a Mountain Dew ad that was criticized for portraying racial stereotypes and appearing to make light of violence toward women. It pulled that ad from online channels, and said it was never intended to run on TV. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi ||||| Yesterday, the Internet was devastatingly angered by Pepsi\u2019s latest Kendall Jenner-starring advert that trivialised the Black Live Matter movement to promote their cola. \n \n While the company may have pulled the advert, claiming they \u201cwe missed the mark\u201d, that didn\u2019t stop late-night comedians ripping into Pepsi. \n \n Kicking things off was Stephen Colbert: \u201cWe have a deeply divided nation,\u201d the Late Show host said. \u201cBut today, it seems that everyone has come together to join the protest against the new protest ad from Pepsi.\u201d \n \n The 52-year-old then began to dissect exactly what happens throughout the advert, barely containing his own laughter: \"It starts with a throng of beautiful, multi-ethnic people protesting in the streets of, I\u2019m gonna guess Newport, Rhode Island. \n \n Pepsi and Kendall Jenner criticised over new advert that 'co-opts police brutality' \n \n \u201cSo far, we don\u2019t know what has caused all of America\u2019s hot extras to take to the streets.

All women deserve a dignified and respectful workplace.\" \n \n The former Fox News host sued former Fox News chairman and CEO Roger Ailes in July, alleging that he sexually harassed her and terminated her contract in retaliation. Ailes has denied the allegations, though after 21st Century Fox launched an investigation into the claims by Carlson and several other women, Ailes resigned from the company with a reported $40 million parachute. \n \n Now Fox News is settling the suit on Ailes' behalf, even though the company was not named as a defendant in the case. It isn't clear whether Ailes will be paying a portion of it. \n \n According to Vanity Fair, the settlement will come with a public apology to Carlson on behalf of Fox, which is also reportedly in talks with two other women for their own settlements. \n \n Though a settlement was never off the table, Carlson and her team indicated early on that that wasn't their ultimate goal. \n \n \"We haven\u2019t discussed a settlement with our client or anything because no one has raised it. This is about more than money.

I deal with Roger Ailes often. I've often been alone with Roger Ailes in his office over the course of 15 years and I've never seen anything like what I'm reading about in the papers and the magazine.\"Although Van Susteren's relationship with Carlson was limited to co-reporting on Prince William and Princess Kate's 2011 wedding, a few appearances on The Real Story and \"a cup of coffee or a drink or something,\" Van Susteren believes that sexual harassment claims would have traveled throughout the company.\"People come to me because I've been there so long,\" she says. \"That's why this doesn't have any ring of truth to me. I would have heard it. People don't keep things silent.\"Regarding the claims that Ailes sabotaged Carlson's career because she refused sexual advances and complained about sever and pervasive sexual harassment, Van Susteren says that she found them odd considering Ailes \"was first to put a woman in primetime,\" meaning Catherine Crier.Van Susteren adds that \"most people, man or woman, would give anything to have had the air time [Carlson] had on Fox & Friends\", and would have viewed her move to the 2 p.m. time slot as a \"huge promotion\" since it provided Carlson with her own hour, her own name-brand show and the freedom to \"produce and do what she wanted.\"Van Susteren also described Ailes as \"the king of cable,\" adding that although it's not always a perfect, she's enjoyed a \"very professional and very successful\" working relationship with her boss.\"If Roger Ailes were how he's described, there's no way I would've stuck around. I don't feel like putting up with that stuff and I wouldn't,\" she says. \"Even if he weren't doing it to me, I wouldn't want to work in that environment. I sort of feel bad for Gretchen Carlson because it's sort of a weird thing that she's done. What she's alleging is something that is alien to me. I've never heard it.\"On Wednesday, Carlson filed a lawsuit against Ailes, alleging that he \"has unlawfully retaliated against Carlson and sabotaged her career because she refused sexual advances and complained about severe pervasive sexual harassment.\"The lawsuit includes Carlson's Fox & Friends co-host Steve Doocy, whom she claims \"regularly treat[ed] her in a sexist and condescending way\" when they worked together.Ailes responded to the allegations in a statement \u2013 obtained by PEOPLE \u2013 in which he calls the claims \"retaliatory.\"\"Gretchen Carlson's allegations are false. This is a retaliatory suit for the network's decision not to renew her contract, which was due to the fact that her disappointingly low ratings were dragging down the afternoon lineup,\" the statement reads. \"When Fox News did not commence any negotiations to renew her contract, Ms. Carlson became aware that her career with the network was likely over and conveniently began to pursue a lawsuit.\"The statement continued: \"Ironically, FOX News provided her with more on-air opportunities over her 11-year tenure than any other employer in the industry, for which she thanked me in her recent book. This defamatory lawsuit is not only offensive, it is wholly without merit and will be defended vigorously.\" ||||| It took 15 days to end the mighty 20-year reign of Roger Ailes at Fox News, one of the most storied runs in media and political history. Ailes built not just a conservative cable news channel but something like a fourth branch of government; a propaganda arm for the GOP; an organization that determined Republican presidential candidates, sold wars, and decided the issues of the day for 2 million viewers. That the place turned out to be rife with grotesque abuses of power has left even its liberal critics stunned. More than two dozen women have come forward to accuse Ailes of sexual harassment, and what they have exposed is both a culture of misogyny and one of corruption and surveillance, smear campaigns and hush money, with implications reaching far wider than one disturbed man at the top. \n \n It began, of course, with a lawsuit. Of all the people who might have brought down Ailes, the former Fox & Friends anchor Gretchen Carlson was among the least likely. A 50-year-old former Miss America, she was the archetypal Fox anchor: blonde, right-wing, proudly anti-intellectual. A memorable Daily Show clip showed Carlson saying she needed to Google the words czar and ignoramus. But television is a deceptive medium. Off-camera, Carlson is a Stanford- and Oxford-educated feminist who chafed at the culture of Fox News. When Ailes made harassing comments to her about her legs and suggested she wear tight-fitting outfits after she joined the network in 2005, she tried to ignore him. But eventually he pushed her too far. When Carlson complained to her supervisor in 2009 about her co-host Steve Doocy, who she said condescended to her on and off the air, Ailes responded that she was \u201ca man hater\u201d and a \u201ckiller\u201d who \u201cneeded to get along with the boys.\u201d After this conversation, Carlson says, her role on the show diminished. In September 2013, Ailes demoted her from the morning show Fox & Friends to the lower-rated 2 p.m. time slot. \n \n Carlson knew her situation was far from unique: It was common knowledge at Fox that Ailes frequently made inappropriate comments to women in private meetings and asked them to twirl around so he could examine their figures; and there were persistent rumors that Ailes propositioned female employees for sexual favors. The culture of fear at Fox was such that no one would dare come forward. Ailes was notoriously paranoid and secretive \u2014 he built a multiroom security bunker under his home and kept a gun in his Fox office, according to Vanity Fair \u2014 and he demanded absolute loyalty from those who worked for him. He was known for monitoring employee emails and phone conversations and hiring private investigators. \u201cWatch out for the enemy within,\u201d he told Fox\u2019s staff during one companywide meeting. \n \n Taking on Ailes was dangerous, but Carlson was determined to fight back. She settled on a simple strategy: She would turn the tables on his surveillance. Beginning in 2014, according to a person familiar with the lawsuit, Carlson brought her iPhone to meetings in Ailes\u2019s office and secretly recorded him saying the kinds of things he\u2019d been saying to her all along. \u201cI think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago, and then you\u2019d be good and better and I\u2019d be good and better. Sometimes problems are easier to solve\u201d that way, he said in one conversation. \u201cI\u2019m sure you can do sweet nothings when you want to,\u201d he said another time. \n \n After more than a year of taping, she had captured numerous incidents of sexual harassment. Carlson\u2019s husband, sports agent Casey Close, put her in touch with his lawyer Martin Hyman, who introduced her to employment attorney Nancy Erika Smith. Smith had won a sexual-harassment settlement in 2008 for a woman who sued former New Jersey acting governor Donald DiFranceso. \u201cI hate bullies,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cI became a lawyer to fight bullies.\u201d But this was riskier than any case she\u2019d tried. Carlson\u2019s Fox contract had a clause that mandated that employment disputes be resolved in private arbitration\u2014which meant Carlson\u2019s case could be thrown out and Smith herself could be sued for millions for filing. \n \n Carlson\u2019s team decided to circumvent the clause by suing Ailes personally rather than Fox News. They hoped that with the element of surprise, they would be able to prevent Fox from launching a preemptive suit that forced them into arbitration. The plan was to file in September 2016 in New Jersey Superior Court (Ailes owns a home in Cresskill, New Jersey). But their timetable was pushed up when, on the afternoon of June 23, Carlson was called into a meeting with Fox general counsel Dianne Brandi and senior executive VP Bill Shine, and fired the day her contract expired.* Smith, bedridden following surgery for a severed hamstring, raced to get the suit ready. Over the Fourth of July weekend, Smith instructed an IT technician to install software on her firm\u2019s network and Carlson\u2019s electronic devices to prevent the use of spyware by Fox. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be hacked,\u201d Smith said. They filed their lawsuit on July 6. \n \n Carlson and Smith were well aware that suing Ailes for sexual harassment would be big news in a post-Cosby media culture that had become more sensitive to women claiming harassment; still, they were anxious about going up against such a powerful adversary. What they couldn\u2019t have known was that Ailes\u2019s position at Fox was already much more precarious than ever before. \n \n When Carlson filed her suit, 21st Century Fox executive chairman Rupert Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, were in Sun Valley, Idaho, attending the annual Allen & Company media conference. James and Lachlan, who were not fans of Ailes\u2019s, had been taking on bigger and bigger roles in the company in recent years (technically, and much to his irritation, Ailes has reported to them since June 2015), and they were quick to recognize the suit as both a big problem \u2014 and an opportunity. Within hours, the Murdoch heirs persuaded their 85-year-old father, who historically has been loath to undercut Ailes publicly, to release a statement saying, \u201cWe take these matters seriously.\u201d They also persuaded Rupert to hire the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to conduct an internal investigation into the matter. Making things look worse for Ailes, three days after Carlson\u2019s suit was filed, New York published the accounts of six other women who claimed to have been harassed by Ailes over the course of three decades. \n \n A few hours after the New York report, Ailes held an emergency meeting with longtime friend Rudy Giuliani and lawyer Marc Mukasey at his home in Garrison, New York, according to a high-level Fox source. Ailes vehemently denied the allegations. The next morning, Ailes and his wife, Elizabeth, turned his \u00adsecond-floor office at Fox News into a war room. \u201cIt\u2019s all bullshit! We have to get in front of this,\u201d he said to executives. \u201cThis is not about money. This is about his legacy,\u201d said Elizabeth, according to a Fox source. As part of his counteroffensive, Ailes rallied Fox News employees to defend him in the press. Fox & Friends host Ainsley Earhardt called Ailes a \u201cfamily man\u201d; Fox Business anchor Neil Cavuto wrote, reportedly of his own volition, an op-ed labeling Ailes\u2019s accusers \u201csick.\u201d Ailes\u2019s legal team attempted to intimidate a former Fox correspondent named Rudi Bakhtiar who spoke to New York about her harassment. \n \n Ailes told executives that he was being persecuted by the liberal media and by the Murdoch sons. According to a high-level source inside the company, Ailes complained to 21st Century Fox general counsel Gerson Zweifach that James, whose wife had worked for the Clinton Foundation, was trying to get rid of him in order to help elect Hillary Clinton. At one point, Ailes threatened to fly to France, where Rupert was vacationing with his wife, Jerry Hall, in an effort to save his job. Perhaps Murdoch told him not to bother, because the trip never happened. \n \n According to a person close to the Murdochs, Rupert\u2019s first instinct was to protect Ailes, who had worked for him for two decades. The elder Murdoch can be extremely loyal to executives who run his companies, even when they cross the line. (The most famous example of this is Sun editor Rebekah Brooks, whom he kept in the fold after the U.K. phone-hacking scandal.) Also, Ailes has made the Murdochs a lot of \u00admoney \u2014 Fox News generates more than $1 billion annually, which accounts for 20 percent of 21st Century Fox\u2019s profits \u2014 and Rupert worried that perhaps only Ailes could run the network so successfully. \u201cRupert is in the clouds; he didn\u2019t appreciate how toxic an environment it was that Ailes created,\u201d a person close to the Murdochs said. \u201cIf the money hadn\u2019t been so good, then maybe they would have asked questions.\u201d \n \n Beyond the James and Lachlan factor, the relationship between Murdoch and Ailes was becoming strained: Murdoch didn\u2019t like that Ailes was putting Fox so squarely behind the candidacy of Donald Trump. And he had begun to worry less about whether Fox could endure without its creator. (In recent years, Ailes had taken extended health leaves from Fox and the ratings held.) Now Ailes had made himself a true liability: More than two dozen Fox News women told the Paul, Weiss lawyers about their harassment in graphic terms. The most significant of the accusers was Megyn Kelly, who is in contract negotiations with Fox and is considered by the Murdochs to be the future of the network. So important to Fox is Kelly that Lachlan personally approved her reported $6 million book advance from Murdoch-\u00adcontrolled publisher HarperCollins, according to two sources. \n \n As the inevitability of an ouster became clear, chaos engulfed Ailes\u2019s team. After news broke on the afternoon of July 19 that Kelly had come forward, Ailes\u2019s lawyer Susan Estrich tried to send Ailes\u2019s denial to Drudge but mistakenly emailed a draft of Ailes\u2019s proposed severance deal, which Drudge, briefly, published instead. Also that day, Ailes\u2019s allies claimed to conservative news site Breitbart that 50 of Fox\u2019s biggest personalities were prepared to quit if Ailes was removed, though in reality there was no such pact. That evening, Murdoch used one of his own press organs to fire back, with the New York Post tweeting the cover of the next day\u2019s paper featuring Ailes\u2019s picture and news that \u201cthe end is near for Roger Ailes.\u201d \n \n Indeed, that evening Ailes was banned from Fox News headquarters, his company email and phone shut off. On the afternoon of July 21, a few hours before Trump was to accept the Republican nomination in Cleveland, Murdoch summoned Ailes to his New York penthouse to work out a severance deal. James had wanted Ailes to be fired for cause, according to a person close to the Murdochs, but after reviewing his contract, Rupert decided to pay him $40 million and retain him as an \u201cadviser.\u201d Ailes, in turn, agreed to a multiyear noncompete clause that prevents him from going to a rival network (but, notably, not to a political campaign). Murdoch assured Ailes that, as acting CEO of Fox News, he would protect the channel\u2019s conservative voice. \u201cI\u2019m here, and I\u2019m in charge,\u201d Murdoch told Fox staffers later that afternoon with Lachlan at his side (James had gone to Europe on a business trip). That night, Rupert and Lachlan discussed the extraordinary turn of events over drinks at Eleven Madison Park. \n \n The Murdochs must have hoped that by acting swiftly to remove Ailes, they had averted a bigger crisis. But over the coming days, harassment allegations from more women would make it clear that the problem was not limited to Ailes but included those who enabled him \u2014 both the loyal deputies who surrounded him at Fox News and those at 21st Century Fox who turned a blind eye. \u201cFox News masquerades as a defender of traditional family values,\u201d claimed the lawsuit of Fox anchor Andrea Tantaros, who says she was demoted and smeared in the press after she rebuffed sexual advances from Ailes, \u201cbut behind the scenes, it operates like a sex-\u00adfueled, Playboy Mansion\u2013like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny.\u201d \n \n Gretchen Carlson. \n \n Murdoch knew Ailes was a risky hire when he brought him in to start Fox News in 1996. Ailes had just been forced out as president of CNBC under circumstances that would foreshadow his problems at Fox. \n \n While his volcanic temper, paranoia, and ruthlessness were part of what made Ailes among the best television producers and political operatives of his generation, those same attributes prevented him from functioning in a corporate environment. He hadn\u2019t lasted in a job for more than a few years. \u201cI have been through about 12 train wrecks in my career. Somehow, I always walk away,\u201d he told an NBC executive. \n \n By all accounts, Ailes had been a management disaster from the moment he arrived at NBC in 1993. But by 1995, things had reached a breaking point. In October of that year, NBC hired the law firm Proskauer Rose to conduct an internal investigation after then\u2013NBC executive David Zaslav told human resources that Ailes had called him a \u201clittle fucking Jew prick\u201d in front of a witness. \n \n Zaslav told Proskauer investigators he feared for his safety. \u201cI view Ailes as a very, very dangerous man. I take his threats to do physical harm to me very, very seriously \u2026 I feel endangered both at work and at home,\u201d he said, according to NBC documents, which I first published in my 2014 biography of Ailes. CNBC executive Andy Friendly also filed complaints. \u201cI along with several of my most talented colleagues have and continue to feel emotional and even physical fear dealing with this man every day,\u201d he wrote. The Proskauer report chronicled Ailes\u2019s \u201chistory of abusive, offensive, and intimidating statements/threats and personal attacks.\u201d Ailes left NBC less than three months later. \n \n What NBC considered fireable offenses, Murdoch saw as competitive advantages. He hired Ailes to help achieve a goal that had eluded Murdoch for a decade: busting CNN\u2019s cable news monopoly. Back in the mid-\u201990s, no one thought it could be done. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to squishing Rupert like a bug,\u201d CNN founder Ted Turner boasted at an industry conference. But Ailes recognized how key wedge issues \u2014 race, religion, class \u2014 could turn conservative voters into loyal viewers. By January 2002, Fox News had surpassed CNN as the highest-rated cable news channel. But Ailes\u2019s success went beyond ratings: The rise of Fox News provided Murdoch with the political influence in the United States that he already wielded in Australia and the United Kingdom. And by merging news, politics, and entertainment in such an overt way, Ailes was able to personally shape the national conversation and political fortunes as no one ever had before. It is not a stretch to argue that Ailes is largely responsible for, among other things, the selling of the Iraq War, the Swift-boating of John Kerry, the rise of the tea party, the sticking power of a host of Clinton scandals, and the purported illegitimacy of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. \n \n Ailes became untouchable. At News Corp., he behaved just as he had at NBC, but Murdoch tolerated Ailes\u2019s abusiveness because he was pleased with the results. \n \n Ailes used Fox\u2019s payroll as a patronage tool, doling out jobs to Republican politicians, friends, and political operatives. He made his personal lawyer, Peter Johnson Jr., a regular guest on Fox shows, despite producers\u2019 misgivings about Johnson\u2019s on-air performance. (They nicknamed Johnson \u201cThe Must-Do.\u201d) Manny Alvarez, whose daughter went to school with Ailes\u2019s son, became a medical commentator. \n \n Ailes also positioned his former secretaries in key departments where he could make use of their loyalty to him. One, Nikole King, went to the finance department, where she handled Ailes\u2019s personal expenses, a Fox executive said. Another, Brigette Boyle, went to human resources, where she was \u201ctasked with hiring the \u2018right\u2019 people,\u201d a former executive recalled. \n \n But most striking is the extent to which Ailes ruled Fox News like a surveillance state. According to executives, he instructed Fox\u2019s head of engineering, Warren Vandeveer, to install a CCTV system that allowed Ailes to monitor Fox offices, studios, greenrooms, the back entrance, and his homes. When Ailes spotted James Murdoch on the monitor smoking a cigarette outside the office, he remarked to his deputy Bill Shine, \u201cTell me that mouth hasn\u2019t sucked a cock,\u201d according to an executive who was in the room; Shine laughed. (A Fox spokesperson said Shine did not recall this.) Fox\u2019s IT department also monitored employee email, according to sources. When I asked Fox\u2019s director of IT, Deborah Sadusingh, about email searches, she said, \u201cI can\u2019t remember all the searches I\u2019ve done.\u201d \n \n When Ailes uncovered something he didn\u2019t like, he had various means of retaliation and increased surveillance. Fox\u2019s notorious PR department, which for years was directed by Brian Lewis and is now overseen by Irena Briganti, was known for leaking negative stories about errant employees to journalists. Fox contributor Jim Pinkerton wrote an anonymous blog called the Cable Game that attacked Ailes-selected targets, two Fox executives confirmed. Fox contributor Bo Dietl did private-investigation work for Ailes, including following former Fox producer Andrea Mackris after she sued Bill O\u2019Reilly for sexual harassment, a Fox source said. Ailes turned these same tactics on his enemies outside the company, including journalists. CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter recently reported on Fox\u2019s 400-page opposition-research file on me. \n \n Fox News also obtained the phone records of journalists, by legally questionable means. According to two sources with direct knowledge of the incident, Brandi, Fox\u2019s general counsel, hired a private investigator in late 2010 to obtain the personal home- and cell-phone records of Joe Strupp, a reporter for the liberal watchdog group Media Matters. (Through a spokesperson, Brandi denied this.) In the fall of that year, Strupp had written several articles quoting anonymous Fox sources, and the network wanted to determine who was talking to him. \u201cThis was the culture. Getting phone records doesn\u2019t make anybody blink,\u201d one Fox executive told me. \n \n What makes this practice all the more brazen is that the Guardian was already publishing articles about phone-hacking at Murdoch\u2019s British newspaper division. About that scandal, Murdoch said, \u201cI do not accept ultimate responsibility. I hold responsible the people that I trusted to run it and the people they trusted.\u201d In this case, of course, the person he trusted, inexplicably, was Ailes, and Murdoch does not seem to have wanted to know how Ailes chose to spend company funds. Every year, Murdoch approved Ailes\u2019s budgets without question. \u201cWhen you have an organization making that much money, we didn\u2019t go line by line through people\u2019s budgets,\u201d a former News Corp. executive said. \n \n Megyn Kelly. \n \n Ailes was born in May 1940 in Warren, Ohio, then a booming industrial town. His father, a factory foreman, abused his wife and two sons. \u201cHe did like to beat the shit out of you with that belt \u2026 It was a pretty routine fixture of childhood,\u201d Ailes\u2019s brother Robert told me when I was reporting my book. His parents divorced in 1960. In court papers, Ailes\u2019s mother alleged that her husband \u201cthreatened her life and to do her physical harm.\u201d \n \n Perhaps as an escape, Ailes lost himself in television. He suffered from hemophilia and was often homebound from school, so he spent hours on the living-room couch watching variety shows and Westerns. \u201cHe analyzed it, and he figured it out,\u201d his brother told me of Ailes\u2019s fascination with TV. \n \n After graduating from Ohio University in 1962, Ailes landed a job as a gofer on The Mike Douglas Show, a daytime variety program that at the time was broadcast from Cleveland. Within four years, he had muscled aside the show\u2019s creator and more seasoned colleagues to become the executive producer. Ailes\u2019s mentor at The Mike Douglas Show, Chet Collier, who would later serve as his deputy at Fox, drilled into him the notion that television is a visual medium. \u201cI\u2019m not hiring talent for their brainpower,\u201d Collier would say. \n \n Though Ailes had married his college girlfriend, he used his growing power to take advantage of the parade of beautiful women coming through his office hoping to be cast on the show. Over the past two months, I interviewed 18 women who shared accounts of Ailes\u2019s offering them job opportunities if they would agree to perform sexual favors for him and for his friends. In some cases, he threatened to release tapes of the encounters to prevent the women from reporting him. \u201cThe feeling I got in the interview was repulsion, power-hungriness, contempt, violence, and the need to subjugate and humiliate,\u201d says a woman who auditioned for Ailes in 1968 when she was a college student. \n \n In August 1968, Ailes left The Mike Douglas Show to join Richard Nixon\u2019s presidential campaign as a media strategist. Ailes\u2019s success in reinventing the candidate for television helped propel Nixon to the White House and made Ailes a media star (he was the anti-hero of Joe McGinniss\u2019s landmark book The Selling of the President). But even back then, Ailes\u2019s recklessness put his thriving career at risk. A former model told me that her parents called the police on Ailes after she told them he assaulted her in a Cincinnati hotel room in 1969. \u201cI remember Ailes sweet-talking my parents out of pressing charges,\u201d she says. \n \n One prominent Republican told me that it was Ailes\u2019s well-known reputation for awful behavior toward women that prevented him from being invited to work in the Nixon White House (or, later, in the administration of Bush 41). So after the \u201968 election, he moved to New York, where he continued to use his power to demand sex from women seeking career opportunities. During this time Ailes divorced, remarried, and divorced again. A former television producer described an interview with Ailes in 1975, in which he said: \u201cIf you want to make it in New York City in the TV business, you\u2019re going to have to fuck me, and you\u2019re going to do that with anyone I tell you to.\u201d While running media strategy on Rudy Giuliani\u2019s 1989 mayoral campaign, Ailes propositioned an employee of his political-consulting firm: He name-dropped his friend Barry Diller and said that if she\u2019d have sex with him he\u2019d ask Diller to get her a part on Beverly Hills 90210. (Diller said he never received such a request.) \n \n In 1998, two years after launching Fox, Ailes got married for the third time, to a woman named Elizabeth Tilson, a 37-year-old producer who had worked for him at CNBC. Two years later, when Ailes was 59, the couple had a son. But neither a new marriage nor parenthood changed his predatory behavior toward the women who worked for him. \n \n According to interviews with Fox News women, Ailes would often begin by offering to mentor a young employee. He then asked a series of personal questions to expose potential vulnerabilities. \u201cHe asked, \u2018Am I in a relationship? What are my familial ties?\u2019 It was all to see how stable or unstable I was,\u201d said a former employee. Megyn Kelly told lawyers at Paul, Weiss that Ailes made an unwanted sexual advance toward her in 2006 when she was going through a divorce. A lawyer for former anchor Laurie Dhue told me that Ailes harassed her around 2006; at the time, she was struggling with alcoholism. \n \n Ailes\u2019s longtime executive assistant Judy Laterza \u2014 who became one of his top lieutenants, earning more than $2 million a year, according to a Fox executive \u2014 seemed to function as a recruiter of sorts. According to Carlson\u2019s attorney, in 2002, Laterza remarked to a college intern she saw on the elevator about how pretty she was and invited her to meet Ailes. After that meeting, Ailes arranged for the young woman to transfer to his staff. Her first assignment was to go down to the newsstand and fetch him the latest issue of Maxim. When she returned with the magazine, Ailes asked her to stay with him in his office. He flipped through the pages. The woman told the Washington Post that Ailes said, \u201cYou look like the women in here. You have great legs. If you sleep with me, you could be a model or a newscaster.\u201d She cut short her internship. (Laterza did not respond to a request for comment.) \n \n I spoke with another Fox News administrative assistant who said Laterza invited her to meet Ailes in 2004. The woman, then 25, told Ailes that her ambition was to do commercials. Ailes offered to pay for voice lessons (she declined) and helped her land an agent at William Morris. A few months later, Ailes summoned her to his office for an update. She told him how excited she was about the opportunities, and Ailes invited her for a drink. She suggested happy hour, but he demurred. \u201cFor a man in my position, it would have to be alone at a hotel,\u201d she recalls him saying. \u201cDo you know how to play the game?\u201d She tried to get out of the situation as tactfully as possible. \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable doing this,\u201d she said. \u201cI respect your family; what about your son?\u201d She remembers Ailes\u2019s reply: \u201cI\u2019m a multifaceted man. That\u2019s one side of me.\u201d As she left the office, she says, Ailes tried to kiss her. \u201cI was holding a binder full of voice-over auditions that I put between us. I was terrified.\u201d She says she never heard from the William Morris agent again. \n \n The fact that these incidents of harassment were so common may have contributed to why no one at Fox came forward or filed a lawsuit until now. Ailes\u2019s attitudes about women permeated the very air of the network, from the exclusive hiring of attractive women to the strictly enforced skirts-and-heels dress code to the \u201cleg cam\u201d that lingers on female panelists\u2019 crossed legs on air. It was hard to complain about something that was so normalized. Other senior executives harassed women, too. \u201cAnyone who claimed there was a hostile work environment was seen as a complainer,\u201d says a former Fox employee who says Ailes harassed her. \u201cOr that they can\u2019t take a joke.\u201d \n \n Lachlan, Rupert, and James Murdoch in 2014. Photo: Dan Steinberg/Invision/AP Photo \n \n It is unfathomable to think, given Ailes\u2019s reputation, given the number of women he propositioned and harassed and assaulted over decades, that senior management at Fox News was unaware of what was happening. What is more likely is that their very jobs included enabling, abetting, protecting, and covering up for their boss. \u201cNo one said no to Roger,\u201d a Fox executive said. \n \n The story of Laurie Luhn, which I reported in July, is an example of how Ailes used Fox\u2019s public-relations, legal, and finance departments to facilitate his behavior. Ailes met Luhn on the 1988 George H.W. Bush campaign, and soon thereafter he put her on a $500 monthly retainer with his political-consulting firm to be his \u201cspy\u201d in Washington, though really her job was to meet him in hotel rooms. (During their first encounter, Luhn says, Ailes videotaped her in a garter belt and told her: \u201cI am going to put [the tape] in a safe-deposit box just so we understand each other.\u201d) Ailes recruited Luhn to Fox in 1996, before the network even launched. Collier, then his deputy, offered her a job in guest relations in the Washington bureau. \n \n Laterza, Shine, and Shine\u2019s deputy Suzanne Scott would take turns summoning Luhn for \u201cmeetings\u201d in New York. (A Fox spokesperson said executives were not aware Ailes was sexually involved with Luhn.) Ailes and Luhn would meet in the afternoons, Luhn said, at hotels near Times Square, and Ailes paid her cash for sexual favors. She was also on the payroll at Fox \u2014 at her peak, she earned $250,000 a year as an event planner for the channel; multiple sources confirmed that she was a \u201cFriend of Roger,\u201d with special protection within the company. But the arrangement required her to do many things that now cause her anguish, including luring young female Fox employees into one-on-one meetings with Ailes that Luhn knew would likely result in harassment. \u201cYou\u2019re going to find me \u2018Roger\u2019s Angels,\u2019 \u201d he reportedly told her. One of Luhn\u2019s employees received a six-figure settlement after filing a harassment claim against Ailes. \n \n By the fall of 2006, Luhn says, Ailes was worried that she might go public with her story or cause a scene of some kind. That\u2019s when the Fox machine really kicked into gear. According to Luhn, Fox PR tried to spread a rumor to the New York Daily News that Luhn had had an affair with Lee Atwater (which she denies), a story designed to make Luhn seem promiscuous so that her credibility would be damaged. When Luhn had an emotional breakdown en route to a vacation in Mexico, it was Shine\u2019s job to arrange to bring her home. Scott picked her up at the airport and drove her to the Warwick Hotel on Sixth Avenue, where Luhn recalls that Scott checked her in under Scott\u2019s name. (Scott denies this.) \n \n Luhn later moved into a Fox corporate apartment in Chelsea, during which time, she says, Laterza and Shine monitored her email. (Shine denies this.) Luhn\u2019s father says that Shine called him several times to check up on Luhn after she moved to California while still on the Fox payroll. Eventually, Shine even recommended a psychiatrist, who medicated and hospitalized her. At one point, Luhn attempted suicide. Through a spokesperson, Shine says he \u201cwas only trying to help.\u201d \n \n In late 2010 or early 2011, Luhn wrote a letter to Brandi, the Fox lawyer, saying she had been sexually harassed by Ailes for 20 years. According to a source, Brandi asked Ailes about the allegations, which he denied. Brandi then worked out a settlement at Ailes\u2019s request. On June 15, 2011, Luhn signed a $3.15 million settlement agreement with extensive nondisclosure provisions. The payment was approved by Fox News CFO Mark Kranz. The check, which I viewed, was signed by David E. Miller, a treasurer for Fox Television Stations, Inc., a division run by current Fox co-president Jack Abernethy. \u201cI have no idea how my name ended up on the check,\u201d says Miller, citing standard company practice of signing checks and not asking questions. The settlement documents, which Luhn also showed me, were signed by Ailes, Brandi, and Shine. \n \n After Luhn left Fox, Ailes took additional measures to conceal his harassment of employees. In 2011, he installed a floor-to-ceiling wooden door outside his executive suite. Only his assistants could see who entered his office. According to a former Fox producer, Laterza entered fake names into Ailes\u2019s datebook when women went into his office: \u201cIf you got ahold of his ledger, you would not know who visited him.\u201d \n \n Still, the whispers about Ailes and women were growing louder. Karem Alsina, a former Fox makeup artist, told me she grew suspicious when Fox anchors came to see her before private meetings with Ailes to have their makeup done. \u201cThey would say, \u2018I\u2019m going to see Roger, gotta look beautiful!\u2019 \u201d she recalled. \u201cOne of them came back down after a meeting, and the makeup on her nose and chin was gone.\u201d \n \n In 2012, after I had been reporting my Ailes biography for a year, Megyn Kelly became so concerned about the rumors that she went to Ailes\u2019s then\u2013PR chief, Brian Lewis, and attempted an intervention, according to a person close to Kelly. She told Lewis that Ailes was being reckless and that I might include his behavior in my book. (I did report the stories of two women who claimed Ailes had harassed them earlier in his career, and though I heard rumors of Ailes and Fox News women, I could not confirm them at the time.) Lewis, according to the source, asked Laterza to tell Ailes to stop because he thought Ailes might listen to his longtime assistant. Instead, according to the source, Laterza told Ailes that his PR chief was being disloyal. Less than a year later, Ailes fired Lewis. \n \n Megyn Kelly was not a household name when she started at Fox News in 2004. A former corporate lawyer, she landed at Fox when former Special Report anchor Brit Hume recommended her to Ailes. She still wasn\u2019t well known in 2006, when she got divorced and Ailes tried to take advantage of her perceived vulnerability. She may not have been any more powerful, at the time, than the other women he preyed on, but she was one of the lucky ones: She managed to rebuff his sexual overtures in a way that didn\u2019t alienate her boss. \u201cShe was able to navigate the relationship to a professional place,\u201d a person close to Kelly told me. In fact, Kelly\u2019s career flourished after this. In 2010, Ailes gave her a two-hour midday show, on which she enthusiastically fanned his right-wing agenda \u2014 for instance, hyping stories about the New Black Panthers that many thought were racist. In October 2013, Ailes promoted Kelly to Sean Hannity\u2019s 9 p.m. prime-time slot, where she memorably declared that Jesus and Santa are \u201cwhite.\u201d When asked by a fan on Twitter to name her biggest influence, she responded, \u201cRoger Ailes.\u201d \n \n By 2015, although her show was still reliably right-wing, Kelly\u2019s brand was evolving. After several high-profile clashes with Republican men, including Dick Cheney, she was developing something of a reputation as a feminist. As she entered the final two years of her contract, she started to think about a future outside of Fox, meeting with CNN chief Jeff Zucker in 2013. \n \n Then came Donald Trump. Kelly\u2019s feud with the GOP nominee was one of the dominant story lines of the presidential election; it also exploded the fragile balance of relationships at the top of Fox News. \n \n According to Fox sources, Murdoch blamed Ailes for laying the groundwork for Trump\u2019s candidacy. Ailes had given Trump, his longtime friend, a weekly call-in segment on Fox & Friends to sound off on political issues. (Trump used Fox News to mainstream the birther conspiracy theory.) Ailes also had lunch with Trump days before he launched his presidential campaign and continued to feed him political advice throughout the primaries, according to sources close to Trump and Ailes. (And in the days after Carlson filed her lawsuit, Trump advised Ailes on navigating the crisis, even recommending a lawyer.) \n \n Murdoch was not a fan of Trump\u2019s and especially did not like his stance on immigration. (The antipathy was mutual: \u201cMurdoch\u2019s been very bad to me,\u201d Trump told me in March.) A few days before the first GOP debate on Fox in August 2015, Murdoch called Ailes at home. \u201cThis has gone on long enough,\u201d Murdoch said, according to a person briefed on the conversation. Murdoch told Ailes he wanted Fox\u2019s debate moderators \u2014 Kelly, Bret Baier, and Chris Wallace \u2014 to hammer Trump on a variety of issues. Ailes, understanding the GOP electorate better than most at that point, likely thought it was a bad idea. \u201cDonald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee,\u201d Ailes told a colleague around this time. But he didn\u2019t fight Murdoch on the debate directive. \n \n On the night of August 6, in front of 24 million people, the Fox moderators peppered Trump with harder-hitting questions. But it was Kelly\u2019s question regarding Trump\u2019s history of crude comments about women that created a media sensation. He seemed personally wounded by her suggestion that this spoke to a temperament that might not be suited for the presidency. \u201cI\u2019ve been very nice to you, though I could probably maybe not be based on the way you have treated me,\u201d he said pointedly. \n \n After the debate, Trump called Ailes and screamed about Kelly. \u201cHow could you do this?\u201d he said, according to a person briefed on the call. Ailes was caught between his friend Trump, his boss Murdoch, and his star Kelly. \u201cRoger lost control of Megyn and Trump,\u201d a Fox anchor said. \n \n The parties only became more entrenched when Trump launched a series of attacks against Kelly, including suggesting that her menstrual cycle had influenced her debate question. Problematically for Ailes, Fox\u2019s audience took Trump\u2019s side in the fight; Kelly received death threats from viewers, according to a person close to her. Kelly had even begun to speculate, according to one Fox source, that Trump might have been responsible for her getting violently ill before the debate last summer. Could he have paid someone to slip something into her coffee that morning in Cleveland? she wondered to colleagues. \n \n While Ailes released a statement defending Kelly, he privately blamed her for creating the crisis. \u201cIt was an unfair question,\u201d he told a Fox anchor. Kelly felt betrayed, both by Ailes and by colleagues like O\u2019Reilly and Baier when they didn\u2019t defend her, sources who spoke with her said. \u201cShe felt she put herself out there,\u201d a colleague said. \n \n Frustrated at Fox, Kelly hired a powerhouse agent at CAA and began auditioning in earnest, and in public, for a job at another network. In interviews, she said her ambition was to become the next Barbara Walters and to host prime-time specials. She wanted to prove to the industry she could land a \u201cbig get\u201d \u2014 and the biggest get of all was Trump. So Kelly went to Trump Tower to lobby the candidate for an interview. It worked \u2014 even Trump couldn\u2019t resist the spectacle of a rematch \u2014 but in the end the show failed: The ratings were terrible and reviewers panned her generally sycophantic questions. Worse for Kelly, it eroded her burgeoning status as a tough journalist who stood up to Trump. Afterward, her relationship with Ailes further deteriorated. According to Fox sources, they barely spoke in recent months. \n \n Kelly and Gretchen Carlson were not friends or allies, but Carlson\u2019s lawsuit presented an opportunity. Kelly could bust up the boys\u2019 club at Fox, put herself on the right side of a snowballing media story, and rid herself of a boss who was no longer supportive of her \u2014 all while maximizing her leverage in a contract negotiation. She also had allies in the Murdoch sons. According to a source, Kelly told James Murdoch that Ailes had made harassing comments and inappropriately hugged her in his office. James and Lachlan both encouraged her to speak to the Paul, Weiss lawyers about it. Kelly was only the third or fourth woman to speak to the lawyers, according to a source briefed on the inquiry, but she was by far the most important. After she spoke with investigators, and made calls to current and former Fox colleagues to encourage them to speak to Paul, Weiss as well, many more women came forward. \n \n Ailes was furious with Kelly for not defending him publicly. According to a Fox source, Ailes\u2019s wife Elizabeth wanted Fox PR to release racy photos of Kelly published years ago in GQ as a way of discrediting her. The PR department, in this instance, refused. (Elizabeth is said to be taking all of the revelations especially hard, according to four sources close to the family. Giuliani, who officiated their wedding, told Murdoch she would likely divorce Ailes, according to two sources: \u201cThis marriage won\u2019t last,\u201d he said.) \n \n Two days after New York reported that Kelly had told her story to Paul, Weiss attorneys, Ailes was gone. And Kelly had made herself more important to the network than ever. \n \n Ailes\u2019s ouster has created a leadership vacuum at Fox News. Several staffers have described feeling like being part of a totalitarian regime whose dictator has just been toppled. \u201cNo one knows what to do. No one knows who to report to. It\u2019s just mayhem,\u201d said a Fox host. As details of the Paul, Weiss investigation have filtered through the offices, staffers are expressing a mixture of shock and disgust. The scope of Ailes\u2019s alleged abuse far exceeds what employees could have imagined. \u201cPeople are so devastated,\u201d one senior executive said. Those I spoke with have also been unnerved by Shine and Brandi\u2019s roles in covering up Ailes\u2019s behavior. \n \n Despite revelations of how Ailes\u2019s management team enabled his harassment, Murdoch has so far rejected calls \u2014 including from James, according to \u00adsources \u2014 to conduct a wholesale housecleaning. On August 12, Murdoch promoted Shine and another Ailes loyalist, Jack Abernethy, to become co-presidents of Fox News. He named Scott executive vice-president and kept Brandi and Briganti in their jobs. Fox News\u2019s chief financial officer, Mark Kranz, is the only senior executive to have been pushed out (officially he retired), along with Laterza and a handful of assistants, contributors, and consultants. \u201cOf course, they are trying to isolate this to just a few bad actors,\u201d a 21st Century Fox executive told me. \n \n Many people I spoke with believe that the current management arrangement is just a stopgap until the election. \u201cAs of November 9, there will be a bloodbath at Fox,\u201d predicts one host. \u201cAfter the election, the prime-time lineup could be eviscerated. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s been talking about retirement. Megyn could go to another network. And Hannity will go to Trump TV.\u201d \n \n The prospect of Trump TV is a source of real anxiety for some inside Fox. The candidate took the wedge issues that Ailes used to build a loyal audience at Fox News \u2014 especially race and class \u2014 and used them to stoke barely containable outrage among a downtrodden faction of conservatives. Where that outrage is channeled after the election \u2014 assuming, as polls now suggest, Trump doesn\u2019t make it to the White House \u2014 is a big question for the Republican Party and for Fox News. Trump had a complicated relationship with Fox even when his good friend Ailes was in charge; without Ailes, it\u2019s plausible that he will try to monetize the movement he has galvanized in competition with the network rather than in concert with it. Trump\u2019s appointment of Steve Bannon, chairman of Breitbart, the digital-media upstart that has by some measures already surpassed Fox News as the locus of conservative energy, to run his campaign suggests a new right-wing news network of some kind is a real possibility. One prominent media executive told me that if Trump loses, Fox will need to try to damage him in the eyes of its viewers by blaming him for the defeat. \n \n Meanwhile, the Murdochs are looking for a permanent CEO to navigate these post-Ailes, Trump-roiled waters. According to sources, James\u2019s preferred candidates include CBS president David Rhodes (though he is under contract with CBS through 2019); Jesse Angelo, the New York Post publisher and James\u2019s Harvard roommate; and perhaps a television executive from London. Sources say Lachlan, who politically is more conservative than James, wants to bring in an outsider. Rupert was seen giving Rebekah Brooks a tour of the Fox offices several months ago, creating speculation that she could be brought in to run Fox. Another contender is Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy. \n \n As for the women who collectively brought an end to the era of Roger Ailes, their fortunes are mixed. Megyn Kelly is in a strong position in her contract talks, and sources say Gretchen Carlson will soon announce an eight-figure settlement. But because New York has a three-year statute of limitations on sexual harassment, so far just two women in addition to Carlson are said to be receiving settlements from 21st Century Fox. The many others who left or were forced out of the company before the investigation came away with far less \u2014 in some cases nothing at all. \n \n It\u2019s hard to say that justice has been served. But the story isn\u2019t over: Last week, the shareholder law firm Scott & Scott announced it was investigating 21st Century Fox to \u201cdetermine whether Fox\u2019s Officers and Directors have breached their fiduciary duties.\u201d Meanwhile, Ailes is walking away from his biggest career train wreck yet, seeking relevance and renewed power through the one person in the country who doesn\u2019t see him as political kryptonite, the candidate he created: Donald J. Trump. Ailes may be trying to sell us another president, but now we know the truth about the salesman. \n \n *This sentence has been updated to reflect Shine\u2019s presence at the meeting, a detail that was confirmed after publication. \n \n *This article appears in the September 5, 2016 issue of New York Magazine. \n \n *An earlier version of the article inaccurately stated Manny Alvarez is Elizabeth Ailes\u2019s doctor. ||||| It has been exactly two months since Gretchen Carlson, a former Fox News anchor, sued her old boss, Roger Ailes, for sexual harassment. The suit inaugurated a frenetic series of events, not only within Fox News\u2019s subterranean newsroom\u2014where staffers feared for their jobs and, in one case, even the network\u2019s future\u2014but also throughout the media, as other women came forward to share their own stories of harassment. It all resulted in Ailes\u2019s dramatic, and nearly mind-boggling, ouster from the news network that he co-founded 20 years ago. (Ailes has repeatedly, and fervently, denied all allegations of sexual harassment.) \n \n On Friday, Ailes biographer and New York writer Gabriel Sherman, who has broken key elements of the story, published a lengthy cover article detailing Ailes\u2019s downfall. As I have reported, Ailes\u2019s own apparent paranoia increased around the time that Sherman began reporting his unauthorized biography, which was published in early 2014. According to a person close to Ailes, he hung a wooden door, now dismantled, that obscured any view into his office suite; according to numerous people, he also recorded anyone who entered. Ailes kept guns in the office (a Glock and Smith & Wesson were discovered by 21st Century Fox after his ouster). Carlson and others, including former Fox News booker Laurie Luhn, also detailed Ailes\u2019s alleged harassment, much of it outlined by Sherman in his coverage. \n \n In the early days of the Ailes saga, many applauded how 21st Century Fox was handling the crisis. Rather than defending Ailes, C.E.O. James Murdoch and Executive Chairman Lachlan Murdoch heralded a new era at the media empire by investigating him. Their swift decision to launch an internal investigation into the allegations, handled by the top-flight law firm Paul, Weiss, signaled that the younger Murdochs were prepared to adopt a different tack than their laissez\u2013faire father, Rupert Murdoch, who is famously loyal to his deputies and whose relationship with Ailes went back decades. In doing so, they seemed determined to leave the seamiest aspects of Fox News\u2019s culture behind for good. \n \n But there was always a tension between cleaning things up and preserving Fox News, which makes $1 billion in annual profit. The Murdochs appear intent on putting the Ailes saga behind them as they move into the last stretches of an election and an attempt to corral crucial anchors, such as Megyn Kelly, to re-sign with the network. Now the company has agreed, on behalf of Ailes, to settle Carlson\u2019s suit for a stunning $20 million, according to three people familiar with the settlement. To reinforce their seriousness about creating a new culture in a post-Ailes world, the company offered Carlson a public apology as part of the settlement. \"We sincerely regret and apologize for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect and dignity that she and all of our colleagues deserve,\u201d the statement noted. (The company, according to two people familiar with the discussions, has also reached settlement agreements with two other women.) \n \n Though Carlson\u2019s case is against Ailes personally, Fox is essentially his insurer for any settlement, according to two people familiar with the arrangement, and discussions between Ailes\u2019s legal team and 21st Century Fox\u2019s legal team became very tense regarding how much Ailes might pay in a settlement. (At press time, it was unclear how much Ailes was personally on the hook for.) As part of the language at the end of the settlement, numerous people with knowledge of the deal told me, Carlson has agreed not to bring any further legal action against other executives at Fox News, or against the company itself. \n \n The settlement punctuates an important chapter in the Ailes scandal. While the Paul, Weiss investigation interviewed more than 20 women, according to two sources familiar with the process, it never officially expanded to examine the broader culture of Fox News. The firm, according to numerous people familiar with the process, was apparently never ordered to scour the company\u2019s hard drives for all evidence of sexual harassment or bawdy culture. In some ways, according to one person familiar with the process, the Paul, Weiss investigation simply got a revenue machine back on track. ||||| Acting on behalf of deposed Fox News honcho Roger Ailes and wife Elizabeth, attorney Charles Harder \u2014 Hulk Hogan\u2019s libel lawyer \u2014 has requested that New York magazine and writer Gabriel Sherman preserve all documents pertaining to Ailes, a not-so-subtle threat of possible legal action in response to the magazine\u2019s damning article about sexual harassment at the network. \n \n Magazine spokeswoman Lauren Starke confirmed today that New York and Sherman \u2014 the magazine\u2019s national affairs editor \u2014 have been contacted by Harder, as first reported by The Financial Times. \u201cNew York Media and Gabriel Sherman were contacted by Charles Harder on behalf of Roger and Elizabeth Ailes, asking that we preserve documents related to the Ailes, for a possible defamation claim.\u201d a spokeswoman for the magazine said Monday. \n \n REX/Shutterstock \n \n Harder\u2019s letter \u201cwas not informative\u201d as to specific objections to the magazine\u2019s cover story \u201cThe Revenge of Roger\u2019s Angels.\u201d \n \n Harder might have a hard time choosing just one objection. As Deadline recently reported about the article, Sherman\u2019s details \u201cthe 15 days it took to end the 20-year reign\u201d of Ailes at Fox News after former FNC host Gretchen Carlson filed her sex harassment lawsuit. Among the charges: Carlson used her smartphone to record conversations to support her claims of ongoing harassment by Ailes. \n \n Associated Press \n \n If Harder follows through with legal action \u2014 a big assumption based solely on the contact confirmed by the magazine today \u2014 it would be the attorney\u2019s third high-profile media case in recent memory: He represented Hogan in the former wrestler\u2019s highly successful suit against Gawker, and was retained by Melania Trump in a defamation suit against The Daily Mail and blog Tarpley. \n \n Still, the tactic of a legal threat by the Ailes\u2019 attorney is by now chillingly familiar: After sending correspondence of intent to the Daily Mail in response to allegations that Melania Trump was once an escort, the Mail quickly retracted the tale. A similar response from NY Mag is unlikely. \n \n Deadline\u2019s Dominic Patten contributed to this report",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Gretchen Carlson will take $20 million off Fox News' hands, settling on Roger Ailes' behalf in response to Carlson's sexual harassment and wrongful termination lawsuit, reports Vanity Fair. Included with the settlement is what the magazine calls an \"unprecedented\" public apology for Carlson, an apparent effort by Fox to show its commitment to cleaning up the unpalatable culture allegedly rampant under Ailes' reign. \"21st Century Fox is pleased to announce that it has settled Gretchen Carlson's lawsuit,\" a Fox statement read, per Politico. \"We sincerely regret and apologize for the fact that Gretchen was not treated with the respect that she & all our colleagues deserve.\" Vanity Fair notes that while Carlson's lawsuit was technically against Ailes, Fox serves as his insurer, and conversations between the Fox and Ailes camps about how much Ailes will have to pony up himself were said to be \"tense\" (there's no official word yet on what that figure will be). Sources tell Vanity Fair that two other women were also granted settlements, and that as part of Carlson's settlement, she's agreed not to take any more legal action against Fox or its execs. Carlson issued a statement saying she's \"gratified\" the company has taken \"decisive action\" regarding her suit. In related news: Ailes defender Greta Van Susteren abruptly left the network Tuesday, per Politico. No official word on why, though a source tells Politico it was for financial reasons.

Now Fox News is settling the suit on Ailes' behalf, even though the company was not named as a defendant in the case. It isn't clear whether Ailes will be paying a portion of it. \" Gretchen is standing up for something really important to her, it\u2019s something that\u2019s been a hallmark of her career,\" Carlson's lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith, told Politico in July. \"It\u2019s important for her to stand up for women right now.\"",

    "document": "Mark Cuban found himself on the sidelines of controversy last month, when the NBA banned Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling for life over racist comments. Now in a video interview with Inc., Cuban weighs in on what he does to combat the bigotry and racism he comes across as a manager and an owner. \n \n That\u2019s an internal battle as well, he acknowledges: \"If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it\u2019s late at night, I\u2019m walking to the other side of the street. And if on that side of the street, there\u2019s a guy that has tattoos all over his face--white guy, bald head, tattoos everywhere--I\u2019m walking back to the other side of the street,\" he says. \n \n \u201cI know that I\u2019m not perfect,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhile we all have our prejudices and bigotries, we have to learn that it\u2019s an issue that we have to control, that it\u2019s part of my responsibility as an entrepreneur to try to solve it, not just to kick the problem down the road.\u201d \n \n Last month, the often-outspoken Cuban condemned Sterling's comments as \"abhorrent\" and \"obviously racist.\" He initially opposed calls to ban Sterling from the NBA, saying it would be a \"very slippery slope\" if the league forced an owner to sell the team. ||||| It's not the first time and probably won't be the last. \n \n Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is not shy about voicing his opinion - even when it comes to sensitive subjects. His comments about having his own prejudices and being a bigot in some ways, made during Inc. Magazine\u2019s GROWCO 2014 conference, sparked a lot of national reaction on social media Thursday. \n \n Here's a sampling: \n \n The Daily Beast: But here\u2019s what I know: the only way to address Cuban\u2019s biases, and the views of millions of others who think like him, is to create a space where those views can be heard. Conversely, the way we get the Donald Sterlings of tomorrow is by shutting up the Mark Cubans of today. If the misguided views that each of us hold about other groups are allowed to fester in the dark, they will become more caustic, bitter. \n \n The Smoking Section: I can\u2019t help but think this is just a well thought out attempt to push NBA Commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s buttons. This is strictly hypothesis but Cuban is too smart so just get caught up in the middle of an interview saying something semi-racist. I bet Cuban is sitting back and enjoying how uncomfortable he\u2019s probably made Silver today. \n \n Washington Post: Is Cuban right? Is everyone a little bit racist? Anthony G. Greenwald, professor of psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle: \"He\u2019s not alone. People who regard themselves as fair and unbiased nevertheless can engage in judgments and actions that are biased in ways that they don\u2019t even recognize. What\u2019s unusual about Mark Cuban in this case is that he recognizes it.\" \n \n Mediaite: Don Lemon and Marc Lamont Hill had very different reactions to Cuban. \u201cI don\u2019t understand the controversy really,\u201d Lemon said. \u201cI think he was very honest. And I think we cannot have it both ways where we say we have to talk about race, we have to talk about race. And the moment someone like Mark Cuban, who is known not to be a racist, who doesn\u2019t have racist history, is honest about race, we want to shut him up.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll still call him racist, though,\u201d Hill chimed in. \n \n Orlando Sentinel: What\u2019s the world coming to when you can\u2019t even be honest and forthright about societal issues without being barbecued by the racial riot patrol? Because Cuban had the gall to state the truth \u2014 that he is sometimes fearful of tatted-up white skinheads and young black men wearing gangsta hoodies \u2014 he has ludicrously been labeled a racist by some. I wonder if the people who call Cuban a racist would say Jesse Jackson is also a racist? \n \n Fox News Radio: He (Cuban) has tried to defend himself, but it is of little use. Once you admit to expressing fear of a black kid in a hoodie, you are George Zimmerman, the kid is Trayvon Martin, and the case is closed. Who wants to suffer the consequences now facing Mark Cuban because he thought an honest conversation on race was what the country wanted and needed. \n \n Atlanta Falcons defensive end Osi Umenyiora on Twitter: Guess what Mark Cuban? If i see a black man wearing a hoodie in the middle of the night, I'm crossing the street also! We all have prejudices. That's just being honest. It's how we address them that seperates us. \n \n Boston.com: Taken out of context, the quote about Cuban crossing the street would seem to put him at risk of suffering the same backlash Sterling did. Watch the entire interview, however, and it becomes clear Cuban is trying to articulate the internal battle with bigotry we all face. By admitting his feelings, albeit in a slightly awkward way, Cuban is trying to start a conversation on the issues at play here. It's jarring, yes, but probably also necessary. \n \n Sports.yahoo.com: By calling out his own misguided thoughts though, Cuban offered an example that others, undoubtedly, have also engaged. Perhaps it allows them to see the mistake the way he has. Either way, this is a far better country when people are capable of acknowledging the areas they need to grow and try to speak openly and honestly about it, than one in which they are absurdly too afraid to say even innocent, descriptive words, even in private conversations about positive topics. \n \n Bill Plaschke of the Los Angeles Times: Cuban\u2019s words drift far too close to Donald Sterling for comfort. By acknowledging a fear of a \u201cblack kid in a hoodie \u2026 late at night,\u201d Cuban is admitting he would be wary of many of his own players and fans simply because of their skin color and wardrobe. He is essentially saying he would be fearful of honor students walking to their cars on a chilly Dallas night if they were black and wearing sweat shirts. \n \n Foxsports.com: God love Mark Cuban for being an NBA owner who didn't see the ongoing Donald Sterling mushroom cloud and think, \"You know what, maybe I'll avoid talking about race today in a business interview. Maybe it's not the right time to talk about who I cross the street to avoid. Maybe it's not the right time to admit that I sometimes judge people based on what they look like.\" Nope, Mark Cuban saw all this controversy and thought, \"Now's the perfect time for me to talk about race in America today.\" \n \n Former NFL punter Chris Kluwe in a video on foxsports.com: \"To Mark Cuban I say, thank you for saying what we all know. But use a little bit more context next time. Hopefully people will understand that this is a quote that has to be taken in context because we know Mark Cuban isn't a bigot. We know Mark Cuban isn't prejudiced and the point he's making is a good one: We all have that little voice. We all need to understand that acting on that little voice is what defines us as people. So remember, don't act on that little voice. It leads to bad things.\" \n \n ESPN host Stephen A. Smith: \"I took no issue whatsoever with what Mark Cuban said ... not only because he was forthright, very candid and honest ... but also he happens to be correct.\" \n \n \n \n Businessinsider.com: Mark Cuban's controversial interview during Inc.'s GrowCo conference has led to a lot of intense debate on race and prejudice and whether Cuban's remarks went too far. But the comments also suggest the NBA may have a bigger problem than just dealing with Cuban's remarks. Cuban's comments may be an indication that NBA owners are not unified behind commissioner Adam Silver's efforts to oust Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling. \n \n NewYorker.com: Most of the attention has been paid to Cuban\u2019s candid discussion of his own prejudices\u2014and of his examples of people he crosses the street to avoid. But it is worth considering what Cuban says, a moment earlier in the interview, about the progress that has been made by minority communities in America: \"We\u2019ve come a long way, and with that progress comes a price.\" The word that stands out here is \u201cprice,\u201d as if by working toward a more inclusive and tolerant society we have lost something important. But just what might that be? The right for people to lean on archaic religious arguments to excuse modern injustices toward gay people? Or for Donald Sterling to reserve the right to go on living in some combination of the eighteen-fifties and the nineteen-fifties? Perhaps some people are allowed to say less today, but many people are finally free to say more. ||||| Add a location to your Tweets \n \n When you tweet with a location, Twitter stores that location.

Usually they are directed at the NBA brass or referees. Or contestants on the TV show \"Shark Tank.\" \n \n On Wednesday, he made a few remarks about bigotry that in light of the Donald Sterling scandal caused a bit of an uproar. \n \n In an interview with Inc. magazine at a business conference in Nashville, Tennessee, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire entrepreneur talked about his own bigotry. \n \n JUST WATCHED Mark Cuban remarks sparks fiery debate Replay More Videos ...

The case sparked a heated nationwide discussion about race as well as a debate over Florida's \"stand your ground\" law. \n \n Cuban wrote: \"I think that helping people improve their lives, helping people engage with people they may fear or may not understand, and helping people realize that while we all may have our prejudices and bigotries, we have to learn that it's an issue that we have to control, that it's part of my responsibility as an entrepreneur to try to solve it.\" \n \n CNN commentator and ESPN senior writer LZ Granderson said he thought Cuban was trying to have a nuanced conversation but didn't do it very well. \n \n Granderson said he was disturbed that Cuban equated the hoodie stereotype -- something he said has led to unjust treatment of African-Americans and even killings -- to the stereotype of the tattooed white man. \n \n \"One has history and the other doesn't or the same sort of emotional response,\" Granderson said. \n \n Cuban is one of 30 NBA owners who'll decide whether racist remarks made by Sterling are damaging enough to terminate his ownership rights to the Los Angeles Clippers.

There's no law against stupid. I learned that a long time ago.\" ||||| When Mark Cuban took the stage Wednesday at Inc.'s GrowCo conference in Nashville in front of 900-some attendees, Inc. president and editor-in-chief Eric Schurenberg re-confirmed an agreement the two had made before the interview: It was going to be a no-holds-barred conversation. More than an hour later, after Cuban had touched on everything from what the Sharks of Shark Tank are really like off camera and why he thinks of himself as a bigot, it's clear no such agreement was necessary. \n \n In case you missed the streamed interview live with the outspoken uber-entrepreneur, here are some of the highlights. \n \n On whether he was destined to be a billionaire \n \n \"Oh, hell no. I make sure I don't pinch myself so I don't wake up. All the time I say to myself, why me? Some things are random.\" \n \n On his first entrepreneurial venture \n \n Cuban is best known for his tech companies, but his first business was decidedly low tech. As a junior in college--and at the age of 20--he took his student loan money and bought a nearby campus bar. It quickly became the hottest spot in the area because it was notorious for not really checking IDs. Everything went swimmingly until the bar held a wet T-shirt contest. When the local newspapers covered the event, they eventually ID'd one of the contestants as a 16-year-old girl. \"But she was on probation for prostitution! That got us closed down,\" Cuban said. \n \n On how he made his billions \n \n Cuban's first big startup success was an early software company called Micro Solutions, which he started for $500 and sold seven years later for $6 million. \"I learned to party like a rock star,\" Cuban says. (That's when he traded his lifetime airline pass and bought a private plane for $41 million--still the record for the largest purchase ever online.) \n \n But Cuban hit it even bigger with Audio Net, a startup that figured out how to stream audio online before the internet really even had audio or video. It involved encoding an eight-hour VCR tape and streaming replays of radio casts to see if anyone really cared. It turns out people did care--a lot. \"It was like the YouTube of the start of the internet. Soon they had deals with radio stations and sports teams. In 1999, at the height of the internet bubble, Cuban sold the company to Yahoo for $5.7 billion. \n \n On why bought the Mavericks when it was a losing franchise \n \n When Cuban picked up the Dallas Mavericks, they had been voted the worst team in the league. But Cuban, a self-professed \"basketball junkie,\" was a season ticket holder. He went to the first game of the 1999-2000 season and it didn't sell out. \"We were undefeated--it was the first game of the season. That's the time to be excited.\" But fans were not. \n \n So Cuban bought the team and immediately set out to change the culture. \"I had to explain to the team and to the NBA what business we were in,\" he says. \"It's not the basketball business. It's the business of creating experiences and memories.\" \n \n On whether the NBA was right to ban Clippers owner Donald Sterling for his racist remarks \n \n \"I think [NBA commissioner] Adam [Silver] had to do it. There's a lot at stake for the NBA--it has to be a leader in the culture... but it's a slippery slope. \n \n \n \n \"You can't keep that ugliness out of the league. There's no law against stupid--I learned that a long time ago,\" Cuban said. \n \n Cuban also admitted that prejudice is something everyone has to fight. \"I know I'm bigoted in a lot of different ways. If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it's late at night, I'm walking to the other side of the street. And if on that side of the street, there's a guy that has tattoos all over his face--white guy, bald head, tattoos everywhere--I'm walking back to the other side of the street,\" he says. \"No one has pure thoughts... but it's about recognizing when you have thoughts that aren't right.\" (For an exclusive interview where Cuban elaborates, check out this Inc. video.) \n \n On what he would do about patent laws \n \n \"I'd get rid of software patents altogether.\" \n \n On what he's like as a boss \n \n \"I'm a dick. Ha. Not really... I micromanage you until I trust you. It a back and forth continually... If I send you 30 emails I expect quick responses and direct action. Then we'll go to weekly reports. And I want the bad news first. I want to read, 'God dammit, we lost this sale.' I want to know the setbacks so that I can help you.\" \n \n On what the Sharks are really like off camera \n \n \"People expect them to be the same off camera. Kevin is a jerk on camera, but he's an even bigger jerk off camera. He has his own way of doing business... There's a lot of tension on air... After 10 hour days and 10 days of shooting, you really feel like you want to knock this motherf*cker out.\" \n \n On his weaknesses",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Here's a sign that your disquisition on race didn't go very well: You wind up apologizing to Trayvon Martin's family. That's the position Mark Cuban found himself in yesterday, after a perhaps-too-candid talk at Inc. magazine's GrowCo conference the day prior. Asked about the Donald Sterling controversy, the Dallas Mavericks owner said he was worried about being a hypocrite. The money quote, which he said in roughly these terms at the conference and reiterated in this video interview with Inc.: \"I know I'm bigoted in a lot of different ways. If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it's late at night, I'm walking to the other side of the street. And if on that side of the street, there's a guy that has tattoos all over his face\u2014white guy, bald head, tattoos everywhere\u2014I'm walking back to the other side of the street.\" \"I'm a bigot,\" Cuban said at the conference. \"I think we're all bigots.\" Then he predicted, \"I'm sure that'll be all over the place,\" and, lo, that prophesy came true. Critics and supporters have been vigorously decrying and defending Cuban's remarks (there's a good sample at the Dallas Morning News). Many, including ESPN commentator Bomani Jones and CNN commentator LZ Granderson, jumped on Cuban for making a false equivalency between black men in hoodies and white men with tattoos. \"One has history and the other doesn't, or the same sort of emotional response,\" Granderson said. Later Cuban conceded that point at least, in a series of tweets: \"In hindsight I should have used different examples. I didn't consider the Trayvon Martin family, and I apologize to them for that. Beyond apologizing to the Martin family, I stand by the words and substance of the interview.\"",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Mark Cuban is getting a lot of attention today for an interview with Inc. Magazine in which he defends himself against accusations of being a racist: \"If I see a black kid in a hoodie and it\u2019s late at night, I\u2019m walking to the other side of the street. And if on that side of the street, there\u2019s a guy that has tattoos all over his face--white guy, bald head tattoos, everywhere\u2014I\u2019m walking back to the other side of the street,\" he says. \"I know that I\u2019m not perfect,\" he continues. \"While we all have our prejudices and bigotries, we have to learn that it\u2019s an issue that we have to control, that it\u2019s part of my responsibility as an entrepreneur to try to solve it, not just to kick the problem down the road.\" Reaction has been swift: \"He's not alone. People who regard themselves as fair and unbiased nevertheless can engage in judgments and actions that are biased in ways that they don't even recognize. What's unusual about Mark Cuban in this case is that he recognizes it,\" writes Anthony Greenwald at the Washington Post. \"The only way to address Cuban's biases, and the views of millions of others who think like him, is to create a space where those views can be heard. Conversely, the way we get the Donald Sterlings of tomorrow is by shutting up the Mark Cubans of today.\"",

    "document": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Fashion designer Peter Nygard hopes to encourage stem cell research in the Bahamas \n \n A billionaire fashion designer says scientists have found a way to reverse his ageing process, it seems. \n \n Bahamas resident Peter Nygard says he is receiving stem cell therapy and that a study from the University of Miami suggests he is getting younger, the Bahamas Tribune reports. \"They are looking at me, and my markers have shown exactly that I have been actually reversing my ageing and getting younger,\" the 70-year-old says. \n \n He adds: \"I am taking perhaps more stem cell treatment than anybody else in the world. I have been doing it for four years now, so I am sort of a testimonial that this stem cell really works.\" \n \n Nygard has reportedly been advocating for stem cell research in the Bahamas. A recent change in the law would allow medical centres to open there, though the country's attorney general denies Nygard was involved in the drafting of the legislation, The Bahamas Weekly reported. \n \n Use #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter. ||||| This video is unavailable. \n \n Sorry about that. ||||| By NEIL HARTNELL \n \n Tribune Business Editor \n \n nhartnell@tribunemedia.net \n \n Peter Nygard has assessed the still-closed Port Lucaya Resort and other Freeport-based sites as potential locations for a stem cell clinic, a move that has met with \u201c100 per cent backing\u201d from one of his biggest critics. \n \n Fred Smith QC, the Callenders & Co attorney and partner, when informed of Mr Nygard\u2019s interest in Freeport, pledged that he would \u201croll out the red carpet\u201d for the Canadian multi-millionaire should he translate this into a multi-million dollar investment. \n \n Mr Smith who, as lead counsel for the Coalition to Save Clifton has led the legal action against Mr Nygard\u2019s alleged \u201cunregulated development\u201d at his Lyford Cay home, urged the fashion entrepreneur to abandon any plans he may have had to build a stem cell facility there. \n \n Tribune Business last year revealed that Mr Nygard and his team had held discussions with the Prime Minister\u2019s Office about constructing a stem cell-type clinic at Nygard Cay, part of a total $50 million investment at his home. \n \n This, though, was met with vocal opposition by both the Coalition and Lyford Cay residents, given that it would have involved inserting a commercial venture into a luxury community zoned for residential use. \n \n And Mr Smith told Tribune Business yesterday: \u201cFreeport needs Nygard; Lyford Cay doesn\u2019t. \n \n \u201cI ask Mr Nygard the question. Why swim against the current at Lyford Cay, when you can swim with the current in Freeport.\u201d \n \n Mr Smith was speaking after Tribune Business sources informed this newspaper that Mr Nygard had been examining several potential sites in Freeport, in particular the shuttered Port Lucaya Resort and Yacht Club. \n \n The property is owned by Port Group Ltd, the Grand Bahama Port Authority (GBPA) affiliate, and this newspaper was told the Canadian millionaire had been encouraged to look at the hotel by its owner. \n \n \u201cNygard visited the hotel and other potential sites, but has not made a commitment,\u201d one source with knowledge of developments confirmed to Tribune Business. \n \n Ian Rolle, the Grand Bahama Port Authority\u2019s (GBPA) president, did not return a Tribune Business phone message seeking comment. \n \n This newspaper\u2019s contacts also suggested that Mr Nygard had been eyeing the adjacent Port Lucaya Marina, an asset owned separately by Preben Olsen\u2019s New Hope Holdings. \n \n One contact told Tribune Business that Mr Olsen owned the docks around the Port Lucaya Resort, plus the access canal, meaning that any deal for the hotel would likely require a buy-out of New Hope\u2019s assets, too. \n \n That, and indeed, any deal, is some way off, and there is nothing to suggest that Mr Nygard looked at the Port Lucaya Marina as well. \n \n Mr Nygard\u2019s interest in Freeport, and stem cell research/therapies, is well known. He was feted by both the Government and Port Authority during a highly-publicised visit to Grand Bahama last year, and also appeared at last week\u2019s STEMSO (International Stem Cell Society) conference that was held in Freeport. \n \n Mr Smith said yesterday: \u201cI understand that Mr Nygard has made several visits to Freeport, and is looking at the possibility of a first class stem cell facility. \n \n \u201cObviously, as a licensee of Freeport, I would back Mr Nygard with such a plan 100 per cent. Freeport is desperate for investment, and Mr Nygard is a colourful character with a lot of pizzazz and money. \n \n \u201cHe would make an excellent contribution to making Freeport the pride of the medical tourism landscape in the Bahamas.\u201d \n \n Mr Smith also expressed hope that Mr Nygard\u2019s interest in Freeport meant \u201chis misguided and misconceived plan for a $50 million stem cell facility at Nygard Cay would be abandoned\u201d. \n \n \u201cHe well knows that the Coalition and Lyford Cay Property Owners Association, as well as the Lyford Cay Club, are resistant and opposed to such a plan,\u201d Mr Smith added. \n \n \u201cAny attempts by him to pursue his discussions with the [Government], as disclosed in The Tribune\u2019s previous story, would be met by various court actions against him and the Government agencies. \n \n \u201cBut a $50 million investment in Freeport for a stem cell facility by Mr Nygard would be a fantastic opportunity and investment for Freeport, and I would roll out the red carpet for him next time he comes, just like the Port Authority did.\u201d \n \n Mr Smith said that if Mr Nygard\u2019s interest ultimately resulted in a $50 million investment, it would be \u201cone of the biggest Freeport has seen for years\u201d. \n \n He added: \u201cThe infrastructure is completely in place for Mr Nygard to make a showcase stem cell venture, as Okyanos and others are doing. \n \n \u201cSo there is no need for him to push the envelope and fight the resistance at Lyford Cay, when he has a welcome from business, and the Grand Bahama Port Authority, as the regulatory agency, in Freeport.\u201d ||||| Thank you for supporting the journalism that our community needs! \n \n For unlimited access to the best local, national, and international news and much more, try an All Access Digital subscription: \n \n We hope you have enjoyed your trial!

Use stem-cell research to cure diseases and live forever, just as you would expect a billionaire tycoon to declare in a Bond movie. \n \n In a 10-minute YouTube video titled Bahamas Stem Cell Laws: The Peter Nyg\u00e5rd Breakthrough, the 70-year-old former Winnipegger claims to be at the forefront of scientific and legislative efforts to further the achievements of stem-cell research. \n \n Nyg\u00e5rd claims to have lobbied the Bahamian government to further stem-cell research, though the Bahamas Weekly reported the island nation's attorney general denied the billionaire was involved in drafting legislation. \n \n That alone is fascinating, but Nyg\u00e5rd isn't just a stem-cell advocate. He says he's personally involved in the research by receiving injections of his own cells grown in Peter, or rather, petri dishes. \n \n Yes, Nyg\u00e5rd claims he is actually getting younger. In his video, he calls stem-cell research a game-changer for humanity. \n \n \"This could eliminate all disease. This perhaps is immortality,\" he breathlessly states in a video that appears entirely serious. \n \n \"Ponce de Leon had the right idea. He was just too early,\" Nyg\u00e5rd continues, referring to the 16th-century conquistador who searched for the fountain of youth. \"That was then. This is now.\" \n \n In the video, the septuagenarian is seen dancing with young women in a nightclub, leaning out of a sailboat, playing volleyball and otherwise \"living a life that most could only dream of,\" according to the off-screen British female narrator. \n \n Apparently, the reason Nyg\u00e5rd can dance and sail and play at his age is not just due to copious quantities of money. \n \n YOUTUBE Clothing tycoon Peter Nyg\u00e5rd has been getting stem-cell treatments for four years. \n \n Nyg\u00e5rd claims his stem-cell injections have reversed the aging process to the point where he's become something of a Finnish-Canadian superman. \n \n \"Stem cells are being used for anti-aging and the University of Miami is doing a study about that to prove that it is true. They are looking at me, and my markers have shown exactly that I have been actually reversing my aging and getting younger,\" Nyg\u00e5rd told the Bahamas Tribune. \n \n \"I am taking perhaps more stem-cell treatment than anybody else in the world. I have been doing it for four years now, so I am sort of a testimonial that this stem cell really works.\" \n \n If one were to review more authoritative sources on stem-cell research than, say, a Nyg\u00e5rd-produced promotional video, you'd quickly discover that yes, stem-cell therapy holds a tremendous amount of promise. \n \n Stem-cell treatments may one day cure cancers, repair spinal-cord injuries and alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other neurological conditions. \n \n The problem is, stem cells can be extracted from embryos and cloned, something that freaks out legislators in nations where embryonic stem-cell cloning is illegal. \n \n \"It's the word 'cloning' that creates an aura of terror in people's minds,\" explains Arthur Schafer, professor and director of the Centre for Professional and Applied Ethics at the University of Manitoba. \n \n Schafer believes therapeutic cloning should be legal, as many researchers believe stem-cell cloning could be the greatest medical advance in history. \n \n Want to get a head start on your day? Get the day\u2019s breaking stories, weather forecast, and more sent straight to your inbox every morning. \n \n But Schafer is concerned about the way the technology may be used. For example, a treatment that may one day cure Alzheimer's also may be used to transform a wealthy, healthy individual into a genius, just like in sci-fi movies. \n \n \"We are already a deeply divided, deeply unequal society and this has the potential to create classes of people,\" Schafer said. \n \n We should be cynical about an aging billionaire's motives for pushing stem-cell technology, he added. \n \n \"I don't see him as a great humanitarian seeking to better humankind,\" Schafer said of Nyg\u00e5rd, whose own statements seem to bear out that cynicism. \n \n \"I may be the only person in the world who has my own embryonic cells growing in a petri dish,\" boasts Nyg\u00e5rd in his video, sounding exactly like the billionaire-tycoon Bond villain we all suspected him of being long ago. \n \n bartley.kives@freepress.mb.ca",

(Photo: Jamie Rhodes, USA TODAY Sports) Story Highlights Kevin Ware had successful surgery Sunday night \n \n Ware had his bone re-set, a rod inserted and his wound closed \n \n Ware hopes to rejoin his team in Atlanta to support them in the Final Four \n \n Louisville basketball player Kevin Ware underwent successful surgery Sunday night to repair the gruesome open fracture of his right tibia he suffered during the Cardinals' 85-63 win over Duke in the Midwest Regional final, and he is expected to remain in Indianapolis until at least Tuesday, Louisville announced. \n \n Ware had the bone reset, and a rod was inserted into his leg during the operation that lasted about two hours. The wound caused by the bone puncturing through his skin in his lower leg was closed. \n \n Louisville's late-night release said no timetable for recovery has been set, but the early prognosis from sports medicine director Fred Hina \u2014 given right after the game while Ware was in surgery \u2014 was that Ware is bound for a lengthy recovery, but the injury is not likely a career-ending one. \n \n LOPRESTI: Injury evokes serious emotion \n \n PHOTO: Kevin Ware's moment with trophy \n \n REACTION: Outpouring of support for Ware \n \n Hina was part of the team that stabilized Ware's injury on the court as he was removed on a stretcher. \n \n \"It's an injury that needs to be dealt with in a swift fashion due to the fact that it was open, and there are infection concerns, and then obviously you need to stabilize that fracture,\" he said. \"One thing you have to establish is, is there circulation below the fracture? Did he disrupt any arteries or veins? Once we establish that, it's stabilizing the fracture as tight as we can so that it doesn't move.\" \n \n Ware is hopeful he can return to Louisville after Tuesday, then join the Cardinals as they advance to the Final Four in Atlanta, his hometown. \n \n VIDEO: HOW LOUISVILLE CAME TOGETHER AFTER INJURY \n \n CLOSE Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Kevin Ware talking was a 'calming influence' on the Louisville basketball team, said Cardinals point guard Peyton Siva. \n \n Louisville's team physician traveled with Ware in the ambulance to the hospital after the injury, and Hina and Ware's girlfriend, who was at the game, have been in contact with Ware's mother, who lives in Atlanta. \n \n Ware's mother planned to travel to see him soon, Hina said. \n \n Hina said Ware's recovery time would be based on the nature of the hardware that was inserted in his leg. \n \n \"Because it was a weight-bearing bone and it was such a difficult injury, it will take a while,\" Hina said. \"But he will play again.\" \n \n JOE THEISMANN: Former QB knows Kevin Ware's pain \n \n NCAA: Quickly deletes its own tweet about Ware injury \n \n FULL BRACKET: Complete NCAA tournament results \n \n Hina likened the injury to the season-ending fracture suffered by former Louisville running back Michael Bush in the 2006 season. \n \n Bush recovered to be chosen in the next year's NFL draft and currently plays for the Chicago Bears. \n \n \"Once I spoke to the trainer at halftime and he told me it's Michael Bush's injury,\" Louisville coach Rick Pitino said. \"He said it's going to take some time coach, but he'll be fine. Once I knew that, then I could regroup and just get them refocused. ... He's going to be fine. Now if this was a career-ending injury? (But) we all know how good Michael Bush is right now, and it's a Michael Bush injury.\" \n \n Hina said he's seen similar severe fractures, but there's no getting used to seeing injuries so gruesome. \n \n \"It never gets more palatable,\" he said. \n \n Bush posted on Twitter that he cried after seeing Ware's injury. \n \n \"I feel so bad,\" he wrote. \"Flashback of myself.\" \n \n MORE REACTION: Gruesome injury brings teammates to tears \n \n GAME RECAP: Ware inspires Louisville to win, Final Four berth \n \n Dr. Craig Roberts, chairman of Louisville's department of orthopedic surgery, was coming out of an operation when he caught the replay of Ware's injury on TV. \n \n \"It was very dramatic, very deformed,\" Roberts said. \"I hate to use the word grisly, but it brought me back to Joe Theismann,\" he said, referring to the professional football player whose compound fracture in 1985 ended his career. \n \n An open fracture could have been caused simply by the amount of force and the angle at which Ware landed after leaping to challenge a Duke shot, Roberts said. \n \n \"It looks like what we call a bending fracture \u2014 like snapping a pencil with your finger,\" he said. \"There was a significant amount of force, and the angle looked about right.\" \n \n Roberts said open fractures of this sort would be treated by intravenous antibiotics and surgery to implant a metal rod within eight hours of the injury. He added that Methodist Hospital \"has a very strong group of orthopedic surgeons.\" \n \n Dr. Tony Wanich, an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in sports medicine at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, said Ware's injury was extremely unusual given the circumstance, and that such severe fractures are usually seen in car crashes. \n \n In such an injury, Roberts said that in the \"best-case scenario,\" a patient would begin to show signs of healing within 8-12 weeks. \"With ... physical therapy, top-notch rehab, he may actually be doing quite well by three months or so,\" he said. \"From there, it's a matter of muscle rehabilitation, strengthening, sport-specific rehab.\" \n \n Dr. Robin West, a Pittsburgh Steelers orthopedic surgeon, said that typically, the best-case scenario to return from such a compound fracture is 6-8 months. \n \n But she said the fact that Ware's bone broke through his skin will likely add to his recovery time. \n \n \"The blood supply gets cut off to the bone, and it's an open system,\" West said. \"There can be a pretty significant rate of infection, and the blood supply is worse, so the healing is slower.\" \n \n Wanich said it will be important to monitor Ware closely during the 24 hours after surgery because of the risk of infection and blood flow problems. Roberts said that possible complications could include slow healing of the bones or soft tissues. \n \n \"Sometimes the wound itself is so injured that over time the skin and muscle can die,\" he added. \"The healing itself is sometimes a little delayed on account of its being an open fracture (with) high energy.\" \n \n As for returning to the sport, Roberts thought Ware's prognosis was good. \"There's a very high likelihood that we'll see him play again,\" he said. \n \n Steven Jones, Matthew Frassica and Adam Himmelsbach write for the Louisville Courier-Journal, a Gannett partner property. \n \n PHOTOS: THE BEST PHOTOS FROM THE ELITE 8 ||||| In many ways, it had been an exemplary few days for the NCAA and its signature basketball tournament\u2014a weekend that put the madness back in March. \n \n On Friday, Michigan and star guard Trey Burke completed an epic comeback over Kansas. On Saturday, Cinderella team Wichita State crashed the Final Four. \n \n But for many people watching the Louisville-Duke game unfold, a disturbing injury to Louisville guard Kevin Ware illustrated a different sort of madness: the continued lack of compensation for the players who make the tournament so special. \n \n \"Pray for [Ware],\" columnist Dave Zirin tweeted. \"There is no safety-net for the injured NCAA athlete.\" \n \n Injury among worst seen on TV \n \n Ware's broken leg\u2014\"about the most gruesome injury I've seen in a basketball game,\" bemoaned analyst Seth Davis\u2014came on a routine play, as he landed awkwardly after trying to block a shot by Duke's Tyler Thornton. \n \n And evoking memories of a similar, career-ending injury to the NFL's Joe Theismann, Ware snapped his leg in two places, with his tibia bone sticking six inches out of the skin. Ware will miss at least a year, Louisville coach Rick Pitino said after the game, and it's fair to wonder if he'll ever play high-level basketball again. \n \n The injury was so graphic that it prompted an immediate debate over propriety: Should the footage even be shown? And while websites like Deadspin and BuzzFeed posted links to the video, others (including CBS, which was televising the game) elected to halt replays. \n \n Few protections for NCAA athletes \n \n But the most important discussion returned to the questionable morality of college athletics: Were Ware's services being exploited by the NCAA? \n \n Keep in mind: \n \n Ware was playing for no pay beyond an athletic scholarship to Louisville\u2014a scholarship that's often only renewed at a coach's discretion. \n \n While Ware's surgery will be covered by Louisville, he has no recompense to file for worker's compensation. Under the NCAA's deliberately ambiguous terminology of \"student-athletes,\" the organization is shielded from such claims. \n \n While most college sports programs are money-losers, the NCAA's annual TV ad revenue from March Madness exceeds $1 billion. And Louisville is the most profitable college basketball team in the nation. \n \n What happens next--for Ware and the NCAA \n \n Entering Sunday, Ware was a fringe NBA prospect\u2014ranked 76th among all college sophomores by one service\u2014far from a lock to make that league, but likely to play professionally at some point. \n \n Ware's injury raises serious questions about his ability to do exactly that. \n \n Under a best-case scenario, Ware recovers after several years of rehab, but suffers some loss to future earnings. \n \n Consider the case of Michael Bush, a former Louisville running back who suffered a similar injury in 2006. Bush was a projected top-10 pick in the 2007 NFL draft; after snapping his leg, he fell to the 100th pick and lost out on a windfall of $40 million or so. \n \n Under a worst-case scenario, Ware deals with continued medical burdens\u2014and as Salon's David Sirota points out, ends up getting stuck with the bill. \n \n Sunday's episode ensures that the NCAA will face pressure from Zirin, Sirota, and other usual suspects. Taylor Branch's seminal article on \"The Shame of College Sports\" will be passed around again. \n \n But it's important to remember that Ware's broken leg was unusually terrible, and unusually high-profile. The debate will fade as the next round of games resume. \n \n Meanwhile, every season of college football or basketball sees hundreds of lesser injuries, to lesser players, on lesser stages, with no compensation for the afflicted. \n \n Perhaps it's madness that we're not more mad about that. \n \n Also on Forbes: \n \n -- \n \n Follow @ddiamond",

Quartet efforts to revive the talks have come to nothing. \n \n Angered by Israel's settlement construction in the occupied territories, the Palestinian leadership has stepped up efforts to bring the international spotlight back on their demands for an independent state. \n \n At the UN General Assembly last September, Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, made a high profile application for full Palestinian membership of the global body. But the United States has threatened to veto any recommendation for membership made by the UN Security Council. \n \n The United States and Israel say only direct talks can produce an accord that will set up a new state. \n \n The same day as Abbas made his bid at the UN, the Quartet launched a new initiative to press the two sides back into talks, setting a timetable for Palestinians and Israelis to make proposals on the borders and security for a new Palestinian state. \n \n Preliminary contacts in Jordan in January failed to get agreement on new direct talks however. \n \n The Palestinians last year won membership of UNESCO and say they could seek seats with other international agencies. But other measures to increase international recognition and draw attention to the conflict have failed. \n \n Using its powers as a permanent member of the Security Council, the United States last year vetoed a resolution condemning Israeli settlements which the UN and all major powers consider illegal. \n \n The Palestinians last month invited the Security Council to visit the Palestinian territories. The United States has led resistance to that idea.

A subsequent blast hit a residential area of Ashdod causing extensive damage to homes and lightly injuring two people. \n \n The Grad, which struck in the Gedera area, was one of 31 rockets fired into Israel on Monday. Some damage was caused to a structure in the attack. \n \n At least eight of the 31 rockets fired on Monday were intercepted by the Iron Dome rocket defense system, including several fired toward Ashdod. \n \n However, one Grad rocket not intercepted by the Iron Dome hit a residential area of Ashdod on Monday afternoon, causing damage to homes. One of the injured, an elderly woman, was evacuated to Kaplan Medical Center in Rehovot after being struck by flying glass shards. One other person was injured from glass and eight people were treated for shock following the attack. \n \n Another large southern city, Beersheba, was also victimized by rocket fire on Monday. Two rockets landed in an open area outside of the city and a third rocket was intercepted by the Iron Dome. \n \n One of seven rockets fired at the Eshkol Regional Council area overnight fell near a kindergarten, causing damage to a building. \n \n The Home Front Command, along with the heads of a number of local authorities in southern Israel, decided Sunday night to cancel school in all towns and cities located between 7 km to 40 km from the Gaza Strip for the second straight day. The decision applied to the cities of Ashkelon, Ashdod, Beersheba, Netivot, Sderot, Kiryat Malachi, Gadera, Rahat, Yavneh, Lakiyeh, and the Gan Yavneh Regional Council. \n \n The IDF continued to respond to the attacks with at least nine airstrikes launched against terror targets in Gaza overnight Sunday and on Monday. \n \n Palestinian Islamic Jihad said that two armed terrorists belonging to the organization were killed in IAF strikes, bringing the total number of Palestinians killed since hostilities began Friday to 20. \n \n Palestinians later reported that three Palestinian civilians had been killed in IAF strikes. Gaza hospital sources added that 25 civilians were hurt when an Israeli rocket hit a house in northern Gaza. The IDF did not confirm the Palestinian reports. \n \n The IAF strikes carried out early Monday morning targeted a weapons-storage site and four rocket-launch sites in the northern Gaza Strip and one rocket-launch site in the southern Gaza strip. The IDF confirmed hits on its targets, and stated that the strikes were in response to rocket fire. \n \n The latest round of violence flared on Friday when an air strike killed two Palestinian terror leaders in Gaza accused by Israel of planning a cross-border attack via Egypt.

Col.

Later, Palestinian officials said two more Islamic Jihad militants were killed and a third was injured in an airstrike \"east of Gaza.\" An Israeli military spokeswoman said she was looking into the report. \n \n The deaths brought the number of Palestinians killed since Friday afternoon to 25, with more than 80 injured, according to Palestinian medical officials. \n \n Netanyahu suggested Sunday that the new cycle of attacks and counterattacks resulted from a successful Israeli strike on \"an arch-terrorist who organized many attacks against the state of Israel.\" \n \n \"Naturally, this led to another round with the Popular Resistance Committees, Islamic Jihad and other groups,\" Netanyahu said, naming Palestinian militant groups.",

Keith White. \n \n \u201cThey were anxious to get into the hallways and meet up with the other kids, and you could see the teachers had the same response.\u201d \n \n The 400-plus students had not been back to school since Adam Lanza blasted his way into Sandy Hook and killed 20 first-graders, six staffers and himself with a semi-automatic rifle. \n \n Their old school in Newtown is still a crime scene, so an unused middle school in nearby Monroe was refurnished for them. \n \n Teachers tried to make the new surroundings as familiar as possible. Their old desks were brought in, along with backpacks, coats, and lunch boxes that were left behind as they fled on Dec. 14. \n \n Even the new principal was a known face: Donna Page, who retired from the role at Sandy Hook in 2010, agreed to come back after her successor, Dawn Hochsprung, was killed in the rampage. \n \n Yet there were also reminders of how much the Sandy Hook community has changed since the shooting rocked the nation and stirred debate on gun control. \n \n Monroe Police Dept. / AP This photo provided by the Monroe Police Department shows the new Sandy Hook Elementary School on the first day of classes in Monroe, Conn.

Law enforcement officers have been guarding the new school, and by the reckoning of police, it is \"the safest school in America.\" \n \n Still, Newtown Superintendent Janet Robinson said officials will do their best to make the students feel at ease. \n \n \"We will go to our regular schedule,\" she said. \"We will be doing a normal day.\" \n \n On Wednesday, the students and their families were welcomed at an open house at their new school, which was formerly the Chalk Hill Middle School in Monroe but renamed as the Sandy Hook Elementary School. Students received gift boxes with toys inside and shared joyful reunions with teachers. \n \n One father, Vinny Alvarez, took a moment to thank his third-grade daughter's teacher, Courtney Martin, who protected the class from a rampaging gunman by locking her classroom door and keeping the children in a corner. \n \n \"Everybody there thanked her in their own way,\" he said. \n \n The gunman, Adam Lanza, also killed his mother at the home they shared in Newtown before driving to the school, where he slaughtered 20 children and six educators, including the school's principal. Lanza fatally shot himself as police arrived. Police haven't released any details about a motive. \n \n Numerous police officers on Wednesday guarded the outside of the Monroe school, which is about 7 miles from the old school, and told reporters to stay away. \n \n \"I think right now it has to be the safest school in America,\" Monroe police Lt. Keith White said. \n \n Teachers attended staff meetings at the new school on Wednesday morning and were visited by Gov. Dannel P. Malloy before the open house, White said. \n \n Robinson said Chalk Hill School has been transformed into a \"cheerful\" place for the surviving students to resume normal school routines. She said mental health counselors continue to be available for anyone who needs them. \n \n During the open house, Alvarez said his 8-year-old daughter also got to pick out a stuffed animal to take home from the school library. \n \n \"I'm not worried about her going back,\" he said of his daughter Cynthia. \"The fear kind of kicks back in a little bit, but we're very excited for her and we got to see many, many kids today. The atmosphere was very cheerful.\" \n \n Several signs welcoming the Sandy Hook students to their new school were posted along the road leading to the school in a rural, mostly residential neighborhood. One said \"Welcome Sandy Hook Elementary Kids,\" while a similar sign added \"You are in our prayers.\" \n \n Teams of workers, many of them volunteers, prepared the Chalk Hill school with fresh paint and new furniture and even raised bathroom floors so the smaller elementary school students can reach the toilets.

Since then the virus has appeared sporadically, with just a dozen outbreaks on record, many -- including the current situation -- involving just a single patient. \n \n Marburg virus causes symptoms similar to Ebola, beginning with fever and weakness and often leading to internal or external bleeding, organ failure and death. The death rate runs as high as 80 percent, although it was significantly lower in the initial outbreak when patients were cared for in relatively modern, European hospitals. \n \n The most recent outbreak, also in Uganda, in 2012, killed four out of 15 patients, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n \n On Tuesday, CDC Director Thomas Frieden pointed to the most recent Marburg case as an example of how a deadly virus could be contained. \n \n \"We've done important work in Uganda to help the Ugandans better have a laboratory network so they can find cases, have a response network with disease detectives who can follow up and have an emergency operations center to trace individual cases,\" Frieden said. \n \n The extensive contact tracing included tracking an embalmer back to Kenya, where he was tested and found not to be infected with Marburg. \n \n \"I mention this, because oftentimes in public health, what gets noticed is what happens and it's hard to see what doesn't happen,\" Frieden continued, noting that there have so far been no additional cases. \"That may not make headlines, but it does give us confidence that we can control Ebola in West Africa.\" ||||| \n \n Marburg virus is closely related to Ebola. (C. Bickel/Science Translational Medicine) \n \n A 30-year-old hospital technician died of the Marburg virus this weekend in Uganda, health officials there announced Sunday. Marburg, like Ebola, is a hemorrhagic fever. It's rare but severe. \n \n According to NBC's Monday report, officials in Uganda have quarantined about 80 people who came into contact with the victim, one of whom \u2014 the man's brother \u2014 has developed the early symptoms of the disease. Sixty of those quarantined are health-care workers. \n \n On Tuesday, Uganda's Ministry of Health said in an emailed statement that testing on 11 potential cases of Marburg came back negative, including that of the victim's brother. Those who still show symptoms similar to Marburg three days from now will be re-tested at that time, the ministry added. \n \n As with Ebola, there is no cure for the virus. And like Ebola, Marburg can have a high death rate for those infected. That's leading many to wonder whether the Marburg case will begin yet another deadly outbreak of a terrifying disease in Africa, even though the bulk of the evidence suggests otherwise. \n \n What is Marburg \u2014 and what are the symptoms? \n \n Ebola and Marburg are the exclusive members of the Filovirus family of hemorrhagic fevers. \n \n Marburg has an incubation period of five to 10 days, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. After that, infected individuals can develop a severe headache, myalgia, a fever and chills. Like Ebola, those initial symptoms are similar to many other diseases, including malaria. \n \n After a few days, the symptoms worsen. They can include nausea, vomiting, chest pain, a sore throat, abdominal pain, diarrhea and a rash. Eventually, severe cases progress to \"jaundice, inflammation of the pancreas, severe weight loss, delirium, shock, liver failure, massive hemorrhaging and multi-organ dysfunction,\" the CDC explains. \n \n There's a huge range in the disease's fatality rate in previous outbreaks, from 23 percent to 90 percent. \n \n How do you catch it? \n \n Marbug, like Ebola, is not an airborne virus. The disease is spread through direct contact with the blood, tissues or bodily fluids of an infected person or, as has happened in many cases before, an infected primate or fruit bat. \n \n Although Marburg seems to have its origin in and around Uganda, the first outbreak was actually in Europe: In 1967, laboratory workers in Germany and what was then Yugoslavia fell ill after handling African green monkeys imported from Uganda. There were 31 reported human cases and seven deaths, according to the CDC. \n \n Other outbreaks have originated with travelers who visited caves inhabited by likely vectors of the disease, like the Kitum Cave in Mount Elgon National Park in Kenya. It's believed that fruit bat guano is responsible for passing the disease along to humans in multiple instances. \n \n In 1998, a larger-scale outbreak of Marburg infected 154 people, killing 128. Most of those infected were young males working in a gold mine there, according to the CDC. Another large outbreak in Angola infected 252 people and killed 227 in 2004. \n \n Once a human catches the disease from an animal vector, it spreads person to person through direct contact. Often, as with Ebola, the people who care for human victims of Marburg are at the highest risk of becoming infected themselves. \n \n What's the treatment? \n \n There is no specific treatment for Marburg, nor is there a proven vaccine or cure. Hospitalized patients should receive \"general supportive therapy,\" the World Health Organization notes. That includes treating any complicating infections, balancing fluids and electrolytes and replacing any blood loss. \n \n Because of Marburg's close relation to Ebola, there are experimental treatments being developed by some of the same companies working on Ebola drugs. Tekmira pharmaceutical announced that it had tested a drug on lab monkeys infected with a particularly deadly strain of Marburg. Many of the animals treated with the drug, even after the onset of symptoms, recovered, according to Reuters. \n \n Tekmira makes TKM-Ebola, one of a handful of experimental Ebola treatments used on Americans who caught Ebola in West Africa. \n \n Will the Marburg virus be at the center of the next terrifying outbreak? \n \n We can't predict the future, but this seems extremely unlikely. Uganda has experienced previous outbreaks of both Ebola and Marburg and controlled them. Here's what the country's prime minister had to say about the potential for a large-scale outbreak in his country after the Marburg victim died: \n \n Marburg is a Viral Hemorrhagic fever caused by the Marburg virus. MOH has put in place rigorous surveillance & disease control measures \u2014 Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda (@RuhakanaR) October 5, 2014 \n \n Uganda has previously successfully handled similar situations of health threats involving Hemorrhagic fevers #Marbugdisease #Ebola \u2014 Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda (@RuhakanaR) October 5, 2014 \n \n Uganda has experience and adequate capacity to deal with this health threat & World Health Organisation has been informed #Marburgdisease \u2014 Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda (@RuhakanaR) October 5, 2014 \n \n Ruhakana Rugunda, who became prime minister in 2014, is a physician who used to serve as the country's health minister. \n \n According to the CDC, the most recent Marburg outbreak in Uganda infected 15 people and killed four. The outbreak lasted three weeks. \n \n Although Marburg is deadly, it is not particularly easy to catch. If an outbreak is identified early and controlled, it is unlikely to escalate the way the current Ebola outbreak has in West Africa. \n \n [This post has been updated]",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 At least 99 people have been quarantined in four different locations in Uganda so far after State House Uganda confirmed a man died this week of the Marburg virus\u2014a type of hemorrhagic fever that's strikingly similar to Ebola, CNN reports. Many of the individuals now in isolation are health workers, as the deceased was a radiographer in a Kampala hospital and another health center and had contact with multiple colleagues. So far 11 of the quarantined have tested negative for Marburg, though they may be retested in a few days if the symptoms they've developed don't disappear. And those symptoms might sound familiar if you've been following the Ebola situation: Both viruses are members of the Filovirus family and manifest in similar ways, including fever, severe headache, and major bleeding, the Washington Post reports. Although many of the outbreaks recorded since Marburg was IDed in 1967 have been single cases, the fatality rate ranges from 23% to 90% (if you discount those single-case years), the CDC notes. Perhaps to mitigate increasing concern over Ebola after Thomas Duncan's death in Texas this week, CDC Director Thomas Frieden has been talking up efforts the CDC has undertaken in Uganda and emphasized that no further Marburg cases have been documented. \"That may not make headlines, but it does give us confidence that we can control Ebola in West Africa,\" he says, per CNN. Dr. Ruhakana Rugunda, Uganda's prime minister, seems to share Frieden's optimism, posting a series of tweets this week that indicate the country's success rate and experience in dealing with hemorrhagic fevers.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Health officials in Uganda are scrambling to contain an outbreak of Marburg virus, which has killed at least four people and sickened dozens more, the BBC reports. Most of the cases have been in the northeast of the country, where workers at a gold mine have been hardest hit. The virus, which causes vomiting, fever, and rash, can be passed from person to person. Symptoms can include fever, chills, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and jaundice, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Uganda's president, Yoweri Kaweri Museveni, has urged people to avoid traveling to the country's northeast, where most of the cases have occurred. \"Let's not encourage bad planning and squander our resources,\" he said. \"The country spends US$450 million on foreign travels and yet coffee alone fetches the country US$500 million. If we have discipline and reduce on the expenditure and foreign travels, we can increase OWC funds. I am glad some people have woken up and embraced commercial farming.\"",

    "document": "Trouble at the Top \n \n More deaths on Everest underscore its problems with overcrowding and unstable weather and geography, writes Nick Heil. \n \n By now, everyone has seen the startling photos and video of the conga line of climbers ascending Everest earlier this month. If you\u2019ve ever wondered what a human traffic jam looks like at the roof of the world, there it is, in all its goose-down glory. The images, from just a few days ago, show as many as 300 mountaineers moving between Camp 3, on the Lhotse Face, to Camp 4, on the South Col. This isn\u2019t summit day, when those climbers converged again even higher up, but it\u2019s nearly as bad. Many of them successfully reached the top, but at least four didn\u2019t make it back to the bottom. \n \n A couple of weeks earlier, an equally surprising, if less sensational, story emerged from the mountain, this time from Base Camp. I\u2019m referring to the unprecedented May 7 decision by Russell Brice, owner and expedition leader of Himalayan Experience (Himex), one of the largest and most successful operators on Everest, to cancel his climb, pull up stakes, and go home. Himex has run commercial trips on Everest since 1994, and this year had more than 60 team members on the hill, not to mention a village worth of tents, food, fuel, ropes, radios, and other gear and supplies. Clients had coughed up a nonrefundable $60,000 for the climb, and they\u2019d barely ventured above base camp. After the fateful meeting that morning, Greg Paul, one of the Himex team members who was blogging about his Everest climb, wrote, \u201cJaws dropped and shock spread throughout the room. Long held dreams, years of training, big time and financial commitments all down the drain in one pronouncement.\u201d \n \n A few days later, Himex elaborated on the specific reasons the team decided to abort. These included dramatic warmer-than-usual temperatures; dire warnings from experienced sherpas passing through the Khumbu Icefall about its instability; a massive serac (a hanging ice-cliff) directly threatening climbers from above the trail; abundant rockfall on the Lhotse Face (a steep section of the route); and at least two near misses from avalanches earlier in the season. If overcrowding was also part of their calculus, there was no mention of it on the site. \n \n The growing number of climbers on Everest\u2014most of them amateurs\u2014and the increasing instability of the high-alpine environment, sum up the mountain\u2019s enduring dilemma: How to manage its burgeoning popularity as the terrain becomes ever more dangerous. \n \n With Himex gone, a mere 700 or so climbers remain on the south side this season (additional teams are also climbing on the north side of the mountain, in Tibet). By May 23, the total body count was up to 11 on the season (the 11th person was reported dead, but has since been found and rescued), barely shy of Everest\u2019s deadlist year, 1996, when 15 people perished, including eight in one day. Currently, a second wave of 200 or so climbers are poised to make a summit bid on May 24-25. Not surprisingly, many observers and media outlets are already fluttering with morbid prognostications of additional carnage. The public isn\u2019t infatuated with this place because it expects everything to turn out OK. \n \n For those who are unfamiliar with how the Everest dance works, here\u2019s a primer: Climbing teams spend weeks on the mountain acclimatizing before making their summit push, typically between early May and the first week of June, a brief weather window that provides favorable chances of reaching the summit\u2014and returning alive. Everyone ascends via the same route, clipping into ropes stitched up the mountainside\u2014six miles of it\u2014all the way to the top. On summit day, you race the clock, trying to get up and down before your oxygen runs out and your body gives in to the hypoxic environment. There is no cap on the total number of climbing permits issued each year (Nepal is happy to collect the permit fees). Nor are there any regulations determining who goes, or when. If the forecast looks good, it\u2019s up to the loose confederacy of international expeditions to determine whether they jump or stay put. \n \n Commercial climbing on Everest is in trouble. Despite the best efforts of the established players to improve communication and cooperation; despite a full-time independent medical clinic now operating at base camp; despite, even, the arrival of powerful, high-altitude rescue helicopters servicing some of Everest\u2019s high terrain, the mountain\u2019s two biggest problems\u2014the sheer number of climbers and the deteriorating conditions\u2014have expanded beyond anyone\u2019s control. \n \n The latter, a growing body of research suggests, may well be linked to climate change. The conditions on Everest this year could be a seasonal aberration, but some hard evidence indicates the unstable trend is here to stay. Nepal\u2019s glaciers have shrunk more than 20 percent in the last 30 years, and the rate has accelerated during the last decade, according to research from the International Center for Integrated Mountain Development. Temperatures throughout the Himalayas are, on average, rising, and the mountains are falling apart in the warming atmosphere. As the Himex climber Greg Paul noted in his post, \u201cRussell [Brice] expects an accident of catastrophic proportions to possible [sic] hit the icefall.\u201d \n \n Corbis (4) Mountaineers descend from the summit of Everest May 19, 2009 \n \n For every outfit like Himex that makes a prudent, conservative decision to leave, however, a dozen other expeditions stand ready to fill in the vacated boot track. That\u2019s because, since so much is already in motion, it\u2019s nearly impossible to reverse course, a pressure that only intensifies the closer teams get to the top. It\u2019s one of the reasons Himex\u2019s decision is so astonishing. For all the ballyhoo directed at successful Everesters, bailing out midclimb requires an act of will beyond the capacity of most commercial mountaineers. It\u2019s far easier to ignore the risks than to heed them. \n \n Something else may be happening, too. The proliferation of communication technology now commonplace on remote expeditions has taken Everest voyeurism to new heights. Photos, video, podcasts, lengthy written dispatches, 3D graphics, and GPS tracking tools flood websites each spring, beaming reports from the mountain, practically in real time. Far from serving as cautionary tales, warning wannabes from the dangerous slopes, these extreme reality shows only bolster the peak\u2019s mystique, prestige, and appeal. Climbing Everest has long been a spectacle; now it\u2019s a spectator sport, with no shortage of willing participants. ||||| In \"Disposable Man\" (August 2013), Grayson Schaffer's story about the risks Sherpas face helping paying clients up Everest, we wanted to know the fatality rate of ethnic Sherpas working on Everest. And we also wanted to answer another question: How did this rate compare to traditionally dangerous industries such as commercial fishing, wilderness aviation (a.k.a. bush pilots), and even military combat. \n \n Annual Fatality Rates by Profession \n \n Number of Sherpas Killed on Everest by Year \n \n To do that, we used the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics' formula for fatality rates per 100,000 full-time equivalents. Determining fatalities was easy: the Himalayan Database keeps excellent records. But figuring out how many hours Sherpas work each season took some legwork\u2014Sherpas don't punch in and out like miners do, and employers aren't paying them by the hour. But we consulted with guides, outfitters, and climbers to arrive at numbers we felt gave a fair picture of just how dangerous the job was (the results: far more dangerous than being a soldier in Iraq from 2003 to 2007). There was only one hitch: to be consistent with the Bureau of Labor Statistic's numbers, we only calculated the number for fatalities from 2000 to 2010. And fatalities have been rising since then. If we calculate the fatality rate for the past decade, the numbers become much more distressing. \n \n Annual Fatality Rates by Profession \n \n (Deaths per 100,000 full-time equivalents) \n \n Miners (2000-2010): 25 \n \n Commercial Fisherman (2000-2010): 124 \n \n Alaskan Bush Pilots (1990-2009): 287 \n \n U.S. military in Iraq (2003-2007): 335 \n \n Everest Sherpas (2000-2010): 1,332 \n \n Everest Sherpas (2004-2014): 4,053 \n \n The reason for the discrepancy is simple. From 2000 to 2010, only seven ethnic Sherpas died on the mountain. Since then, 21 Sherpas have perished, including the 16 who died in the avalanche yesterday. \n \n Number of Sherpas Killed on Everest By Year \n \n 2014: 17 \n \n 2013: 4 \n \n 2012: 3 \n \n 2011: 0 \n \n 2010: 0 \n \n 2009: 1 \n \n 2008: 0 \n \n 2007: 1 \n \n 2006: 4 \n \n 2005: 0 \n \n 2004: 0 \n \n 2003: 0 \n \n 2002: 0 \n \n 2001: 1 \n \n 2000: 0 \n \n This year is not just the mountain's worst tragedy. It caps the worst three-year period in Everest history. ||||| For many years, the most lucrative commercial guiding operation on Mt. Everest has been a company called Himalayan Experience, or Himex, which is owned by a New Zealand mountaineer named Russell Brice. In the spring of 2012, more than a month into the climbing season, he became increasingly worried about a bulge of glacial ice three hundred yards wide that was frozen tenuously to Everest\u2019s West Shoulder, hanging like a massive sword of Damocles directly over the main route up the Nepal side of the mountain. Brice\u2019s clients (\u201cmembers,\u201d in the parlance of Himalayan mountaineering), Western guides, and Sherpas repeatedly had to climb beneath the threatening ice bulge as they moved up and down the mountain to acclimatize and establish a series of higher camps necessary for their summit assault. One day, Brice timed how long it took his head guide, Adrian Ballinger (\u201cwho is incredibly fast,\u201d he wrote in the blog post excerpted below), to climb through the most hazardous terrain: \n \n Adding to Brice\u2019s concern, some of his most experienced Sherpas, ordinarily exceedingly stoical men, approached him to say that the conditions on the mountain made them fear for their lives. One of them actually broke down in tears as he confessed this. So on May 7, 2012, Brice made an announcement that shocked most of the thousand people camped at the base of Everest: he was pulling all his guides, members, and Sherpas off the mountain, packing up their tents and equipment, and heading home. He was widely criticized for this decision in 2012, and not just by clients who were forced to abandon their dreams of climbing the world\u2019s highest mountain without receiving a refund for the forty-three thousand euros they had paid him in advance. Many of the other expedition leaders also thought Brice was wildly overreacting. The reputation of Himex took a major hit. \n \n After what happened last Friday, though, it\u2019s hard to argue with Brice\u2019s call. On April 18th, shortly before 7 A.M. local time, an overhanging wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion broke loose from the same ice bulge that had frightened Brice into leaving Everest in 2012. As it crashed onto the slope below, the ice shattered into truck-size chunks and hurtled toward some fifty climbers laboring slowly upward through the Khumbu Icefall, a jumbled maze of unstable ice towers that looms above the 17,600-foot base camp. The climbers in the line of fire were at approximately nineteen thousand feet when the avalanche struck. Of the twenty-five men hit by the falling ice, sixteen were killed, all of them Nepalis working for guided climbing teams. Three of the bodies were buried beneath the frozen debris and may never be found. \n \n Although many news reports indicated that all the victims were Sherpas, the legendary mountain people who comprise just half of one per cent of the Nepali population, three of the sixteen were members of other, much larger ethnic groups: one was Gurung, one was Tamang, and one was a member of the Hindu Chhetri caste. All, however, were employed as high-altitude climbing Sherpas\u2014an \u00e9lite profession that deservedly commands respect and admiration from mountaineers around the world. \n \n It was the worst climbing accident in the history of Everest, twice as deadly as the infamous storm in May, 1996, that killed eight people, the subject of my book \u201cInto Thin Air\u201d (four of my teammates accounted for half of that grim tally). But dying on Everest has been an occupational hazard for Sherpas ever since a team led by George Leigh Mallory to attempt the Tibetan side of the peak, in 1922, became the first mountaineers to ascend higher than the lower flanks of the mountain. In the final days of that expedition, seven Sherpas from Darjeeling, India, were swept to their deaths in an avalanche. Sad to say, the job hasn\u2019t gotten any safer for Sherpas with the passage of time. According to a piece by Jonah Ogles posted on outsideonline.com, the death rate for climbing Sherpas on Everest from 2004 until now was twelve times higher than the death rate for U.S. military personnel deployed in Iraq from 2003-07. \n \n There is no denying that climbing Everest is a preposterously dangerous undertaking for the members who provide the Sherpas\u2019 income. But running counter to the disturbing trend among Sherpas, climbing Everest has actually grown significantly safer for Western guides and members in recent years, according to the available data. This can be attributed to a number of factors. Western climbers now use bottled oxygen much more liberally than they did in the past; many Western climbers now prophylactically dose themselves with dexamethasone, a powerful steroid, when they ascend above twenty-two thousand feet, which has proven to be an effective strategy for minimizing the risk of contracting high-altitude cerebral edema ( HACE ) and high-altitude pulmonary edema ( HAPE ), potentially fatal ailments that are common on Everest; and weather forecasts are much more accurate than they were eighteen or twenty years ago. \n \n During the seventy-six years from the first attempt on Everest, in 1921, through 1996, when I was guided up Everest, a hundred and forty-four people died and the summit was reached six hundred and thirty times, a ratio of one death for every four successful ascents. Notably, over the eighteen years that have passed since 1996, a hundred and four people have died and the summit has been reached six thousand two hundred and forty-one times\u2014one death for every sixty ascents. Furthermore, non-Sherpas accounted for only seventy-one of these deaths, which equates to just one death for every eighty-eight ascents. \n \n The reason the risk remains so much greater for Sherpas can be traced to several things. Sherpas aren\u2019t provided with nearly as much bottled oxygen, because it is so expensive to buy and to stock on the upper mountain, and they tend to be much better acclimatized than Westerners. Sherpas are almost never given dexamethasone prophylactically, because they don\u2019t have personal physicians in their villages who will prescribe the drug on request. And perhaps most significant, Sherpas do all the heavy lifting on Everest, literally and figuratively. The mostly foreign-owned guiding companies assign the most dangerous and physically demanding jobs to their Sherpa staff, thereby mitigating the risk to their Western guides and members, whose backpacks seldom hold much more than a water bottle, a camera, an extra jacket, and lunch. The work Sherpas are paid to do\u2014carrying loads, installing the aluminum ladders, stringing and anchoring thousands of feet of rope\u2014requires them to spend vastly more time on the most dangerous parts of the mountain, particularly in the Khumbu Icefall\u2014the shattered, creaking, ever-shifting expanse of glacier that extends from just above base camp, at seventeen thousand six hundred feet, to the nineteen-thousand-five-hundred-foot elevation. The fact that members and Western guides now suck down a lot more bottled oxygen is wonderful for them, but it means the Sherpas have to carry those additional oxygen bottles through the Icefall for the Westerners to use. \n \n Historically, more Everest climbers have perished from severe weather, HACE , HAPE , exhaustion, falling from steep terrain, or some combination of these hazards than from being crushed or buried in the Khumbu Icefall. This seems to be changing, however. Accurate weather forecasting has reduced the risk of being surprised by a killer storm like the one that struck in 1996. But the pronounced warming of the Himalayan climate in recent years has made the Icefall more unstable than ever, and there is still no way to predict when a serac is going to topple over. And Sherpas spend much, much more time in the Icefall than their Western employers. \n \n In 1996, for example, I made four round trips through the Khumbu Icefall: three circuits as I progressively acclimatized to twenty-four thousand feet during the month of April, and a final round trip on my journey to the 29,035-foot summit and back. I was terrified each of the eight times I moved through the frozen chaos, which usually took more than three hours to ascend, even with my nearly empty backpack, and slightly less than an hour to descend. In contrast, each of the Sherpas supporting my team\u2019s ascent was required to make something like thirty trips through the Icefall, often while carrying eighty-pound loads of food, propane, and bottled oxygen. \n \n These days, moreover, members are apt to spend even less time in the Icefall than I did when I was on Everest, eighteen years ago. It\u2019s becoming increasingly common for Western guides and members to acclimatize in hypobaric chambers before they arrive in Nepal, or on other, less hazardous Himalayan peaks in advance of their summit assaults, greatly reducing the number of times they must expose themselves to the perils of the Icefall. Some members now make only a single round trip through it, while each of the Sherpas supporting them must still pass through that hazardous terrain between two and three dozen times. Most Western climbers feel more than a little guilty about this, but I know of none who have ever offered to take an extra lap through the Icefall with a heavy load in order to reduce a Sherpa\u2019s exposure. \n \n The statistics suggesting that Everest has become safe for members may, in fact, be giving Westerners a false sense of security, however. The astounding number of climbers who now attempt to reach the summit on the limited number of days when the weather is favorable presents a new kind of hazard. A notorious photo shot by Ralf Dujmovits in May, 2012, showed more than a hundred and fifty people attached to a series of fixed ropes as they ascended the Lhotse Face toward the South Col of Everest, jammed together so tightly that they had to move in lockstep. The static weight of all these people and their gear was well over thirty thousand pounds. If some mishap had occurred that caused more than a handful of the climbers to put their full weight on one of the ropes simultaneously, the shock to the anchors securing the ropes to the ice could easily have caused them to fail, resulting in the climbers falling two thousand or more feet to the base of the Lhotse Face. If such an accident should come to pass in the future (which isn\u2019t far-fetched), the death count for both members and Sherpas would be horrific. \n \n In any event, no Western members or guides were killed or injured in last week\u2019s avalanche. At the moment, in the immediate aftermath, almost everyone climbing on the Nepal side of Everest has retreated to base camp to try to come to grips with the catastrophe. Most of them, Sherpas and foreign climbers alike, are reeling from the unprecedented loss of life. At least one expedition has already announced that it will abandon the mountain. For the foreign climbers, to go home now will mean forfeiting most or all of the fifty to ninety thousand dollars they have spent to be guided up Everest. For the Sherpas who make the guided ascents possible, however, to quit now, after only a few weeks\u2019 wages, will be an even greater economic sacrifice, relatively speaking. \n \n Depending on their talent, experience, foreign-language skills, how many loads they carry up and down the mountain, and how generously they\u2019re tipped by their clients, climbing Sherpas generally take home between two and eight thousand dollars at the conclusion of an Everest expedition, which commences for them in late March and typically ends around the first of June. If a climbing Sherpa dies on the job, his family receives a million rupees (approximately ten thousand five hundred dollars) from the insurance his employer is required to provide. By any reasonable measure, neither these wages nor insurance payouts are fair compensation for the risk involved. But in Nepal, where the median annual income is less than six hundred dollars, most of the Sherpas\u2019 countrymen would eagerly take similar risks for the opportunity to receive that kind of pay. \n \n Nevertheless, on April 20th, after holding several emotional, contentious meetings at Everest base camp, the climbing Sherpas announced that they would go on strike unless the Nepali government agreed to meet thirteen demands within a week. The threat of a work stoppage was provoked by the Sherpas\u2019 outrage over the Nepali government\u2019s offer to provide just forty thousand rupees\u2014slightly more than four hundred dollars\u2014to the families of the Sherpas killed in the avalanche, to defray their funeral expenses. Among the Sherpas\u2019 demands are that the government increase this compensation to approximately a thousand dollars per family; provide ten thousand dollars to climbing Sherpas who have been seriously disabled; establish a permanent relief fund for injured Sherpas with a portion of the ten-thousand-dollar permit fee every Western Everest climber is charged by the Nepali government; double the current insurance benefit provided by the guiding companies to twenty-one thousand dollars; require the guiding companies to pay Sherpas their salaries, even if they call off the remainder of the 2014 Everest climbing season; and establish a monument in Kathmandu to memorialize the deceased Sherpas. \n \n The collective anger and resentment expressed by the Sherpas over the past few days is unprecedented. On April 20th, Tim and Becky Rippel, the owners of a guiding company called Peak Freaks, which lost a Sherpa named Mingma Tenzing to a fatal case of HAPE earlier in the month, stated, in a blog post: \n \n As we suggested in a previous post the Sherpa guides are heating up, emotions are running wild and demands are being made to share the wealth with the Sherpa people on the table. Now that there are more Sherpa operators today on Everest, they\u2019ve come to learn how much the government of Nepal makes in revenues from Everest expeditions and they are asking for a share. This is their time and under very unfortunate circumstances. In any case things are getting very complicated and there is a lot of tension here and it\u2019s growing. Peak Freaks is in support of the Sherpa people any which way it goes. They are our family, our brothers and sisters and the muscle on Everest. We follow their lead, we are guests here. \n \n Should the government and the Sherpas manage to reach an agreement concerning the terms of the new demands, it will come as no great surprise if most of the Sherpas now grieving intensely for their absent companions resume their dangerous work within the next week or two. Many people believe that this is the most likely outcome. \n \n Jon Krakauer\u2019s most recent books are \u201cThree Cups of Deceit,\u201d \u201cWhere Men Win Glory,\u201d and \u201cUnder the Banner of Heaven.\u201d \n \n Photograph by Niranjan Shrestha/AP.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Jon Krakauer takes to the pages of the New Yorker to weigh in on the latest tragedy on Everest (the author was, of course, part of the 1996 disaster that saw eight climbers killed). His piece makes plain the imbalance between the dangers faced by Sherpas and the climbers they shepherd to the mountain's peak, but before arriving at that point, he shares a fascinating backstory: That of Himex, a New Zealand-based company that Krakauer calls the most \"lucrative commercial guiding operation\" on Everest\u2014one that on May 7, 2012, packed up shop after 18 years on the mountain and headed home, taking its guides, members (aka paying climbers, who didn't see their $60,000 refunded), and Sherpas with them. The much-assailed decision was one made by owner Russell Brice, who had grown fearful of a 900-foot-wide overhang of glacial ice set directly above the main route on the mountain's Nepal side, an overhang that his members were directly under for as long as an hour while traversing the route. As Krakauer writes, the \"wedge of ice the size of a Beverly Hills mansion\" that broke free and caused last week's avalanche came from \"that same ice bulge\" and killed 16 Sherpas. As for the outsize dangers Sherpas face, some standout points: Between 1921 and 1996, the mountain's death ratio was a treacherous one death for every four completed ascents. Between 1997 and present, the death ratio was one for every 60. Among the reasons it's gotten safer: Climbers tend to pack and use more bottled oxygen, and some take the robust steroid dexamethasone once they hit 22,000 feet, which pares down the risk of developing the often fatal high-altitude cerebral edema and high-altitude pulmonary edema. Sherpas typically have less of the former and none of the latter (and are, of course, the ones lugging those extra oxygen bottles up the mountain). Krakauer points to an Outside piece that shares the professions with a lower calculated fatality rate than that of Sherpas: US soldiers stationed in Iraq between 2003 and 2007, miners, and commercial fishermen.",

Mitchell Nance, who sits in Barren and Metcalfe counties in Kentucky, issued an order Thursday saying he believes that allowing a \u201cpracticing homosexual\u201d to adopt would \u201cunder no circumstance\u201d promote the best interest of the child, he wrote in the order obtained by The Washington Post. \n \n The judge disqualified himself from any adoption cases involving gay couples, citing judicial ethics codes requiring that judges recuse themselves whenever they have a \u201cpersonal bias or prejudice\u201d concerning a case. Nance\u2019s \u201cconscientious objection\u201d to the concept of gay parents adopting children constitutes such a bias, he argued. \n \n The announcement garnered support from some conservative groups, while also spurring intense criticism from some lawyers and judicial ethics experts who viewed the blanket statement as discriminatory, and a sign that Nance is not fit to fulfill his duties as a judge. Kentucky state law permits gay couples to adopt children, and the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that all states must allow same-sex marriage. \n \n That ruling came in four cases consolidated as Obergefell et al. v Hodges, one of which specifically involved a couple who wanted to adopt but was barred from doing so because Michigan banned same-sex marriage and adoption by unmarried couples. \n \n Nance\u2019s recusal drew some comparisons to the case of Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis, who was jailed after she refused in the face of multiple court orders to begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, saying she couldn\u2019t issue the licenses because her name was on them, and it violated her religious beliefs. Eventually, deputies in her office began issuing licenses. Kentucky\u2019s governor and General Assembly would later remove the name of clerks from the marriage licenses. \n \n Reached by phone Sunday night, Nance told The Post he stood by his order, \u201cbased on the law, based on my conscience,\u201d and to \u201cminimize any disruption in the litigation,\u201d he said. He declined to comment further on the order or calls from the public for him to resign. But he gave no indication that he would be stepping down. \n \n Nance told the Glasgow Daily Times he issued the order so there wouldn\u2019t be a lag if an adoption case was filed in his court concerning adoption by gay parents. Because Nance\u2019s court, the 43rd Circuit Court, has two divisions, the judge of the other division will hear any adoption cases affected by Nance\u2019s recusal. Gay parents seeking to adopt a child in the affected counties should not expect a legal delay as a result of Nance\u2019s decision. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t have any plans to recuse myself from any so it should not affect the ability of any same sex couples to adopt in Barren or Metcalfe counties,\u201d the judge of the other division, Judge John T. Alexander, told the Glasgow Daily Times. \n \n Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law school professor who specializes in judicial ethics, told the Louisville Courier-Journal that by issuing such an order, Nance could be violating his oath to uphold the law, \u201cwhich by virtue of the equal protection clause does not tolerate discrimination on the basis of race, religion or sexual orientation,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cIf he is unable to set his personal views aside and uphold the law \u2014 not just in an isolated case, but with respect to an entire class of litigant because he finds them odious \u2014 it leads me to wonder whether he is able to honor his oath,\u201d Geyh said. \n \n Chris Hartman, Kentucky Fairness Campaign director, told the Glasgow Daily Times Nance\u2019s decision not to hear adoption cases for gay parents is \u201cclear discrimination.\u201d \n \n \u201cAnd if Judge Nance can\u2019t perform the basic functions of his job, which are to deliver impartiality, fairness and justice to all families in his courtroom, then he shouldn\u2019t be a judge,\u201d Hartman said. \n \n Yet other groups, such as the Family Foundation, a Lexington-based group that promotes \u201cfamily-first conservatism,\u201d expressed their support of the judge\u2019s decision to recuse himself. \n \n \u201cIf we are going to let liberal judges write their personal biases and prejudices into law, as we have done on issues of marriage and sexuality,\u201d spokesman Martin Cothran said in a statement on the group\u2019s Facebook page, \u201cthen, in the interest of fairness, we are going to have to allow judges with different views to at least recuse themselves from such cases.\u201d \n \n Cothran added that he was unaware of any state law that would require a judge to place a child in a home with same-sex parents, prompting him to wonder why judges were being held to such a standard. \n \n \u201cWhen adoption agencies abandon the idea that it is in the best interest of a child to grow up with both a mother and father, people can\u2019t expect judges who do believe that to be forced to bow the knee,\u201d said Cothran. \u201cJudges have a right of conscience like everyone else.\u201d \n \n [\u2018Mexican heritage\u2019 judge bashed by Trump will oversee deported \u2018dreamer\u2019 case] \n \n Lawyers told the Courier-Journal that Nance should now also have to recuse himself from any legal cases involving gay people, including divorces involving a spouse coming out as gay. Nance told the newspaper he understands that gay and lesbian people would have reservations about appearing before him. \n \n Nance, who was first assigned to family court in 2004, performs marriages, but has never been asked to marry a gay couple, he told the Glasgow Daily Times. If he were asked, Nance said he would decline. \n \n He told the Glasgow Daily Times he could recall being assigned to two adoption cases involving gay parents, including one from which he recused himself several years ago. About two to three months ago, Nance was assigned to a case in Metcalfe County involving a same-sex couple seeking to adopt. Nance said he ruled in favor of the parents, but decided then he should take action to recuse himself permanently from hearing such cases. \n \n \u201cIt made the matter come to my awareness more directly, I would say,\u201d Nance told the Glasgow Daily Times. \u201cI felt it would be more prudent to go ahead and address it,\u201d he said.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Kentucky has another high-profile official taking a stand against homosexuality. Two years after county clerk Kim Davis made headlines by refusing to issue marriage licences to gay couples, a judge has declared that he won't preside over adoption cases involving gay parents. Judge Mitchell Nance announced last week that he would recuse himself from such cases because of his \"conscientious objection to the concept of adoption of a child by a practicing homosexual,\" reports the Glasgow Daily Times. The move shouldn't have too much of a practical effect: Nance's 43rd Circuit Court has two divisions, and the judge who presides over the other division will handle all the gay-adoption cases. Nance says he has no choice because his personal objection constitutes a bias that requires him to recuse himself, per the Washington Post. Nance's decision has set off a debate similar to the one that arose when Davis made her own controversial announcement. Two quotes illustrate the opposite sides: Pro-Nance: \"When adoption agencies abandon the idea that it is in the best interest of a child to grow up with both a mother and a father, people can't expect judges who do believe that to be forced to bow the knee,\" says Family Foundation spokesman Martin Cothran. \"Judges have a right of conscience like everyone else.\u201d Anti-Nance: If he \"can't perform the basic functions of his job, which are to deliver impartiality, fairness and justice to all families in his courtroom, then he shouldn't be a judge,\" says Kentucky Fairness Campaign Director Chris Hartman.",

    "document": "Former President George W. Bush laughs while answering questions about his presidency at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California, November 18, 2010. \n \n GENEVA Former President George W. Bush has canceled a visit to Switzerland, where he was to address a Jewish charity gala, due to the risk of legal action against him for alleged torture, rights groups said on Saturday. \n \n Bush was to be the keynote speaker at Keren Hayesod's annual dinner on February 12 in Geneva. But pressure has been building on the Swiss government to arrest him and open a criminal investigation if he enters the Alpine country. \n \n Criminal complaints against Bush alleging torture have been lodged in Geneva, court officials say. \n \n Human rights groups said they had intended to submit a 2,500-page case against Bush in the Swiss city on Monday for alleged mistreatment of suspected militants at Guantanamo Bay, the U.S. naval base in Cuba where captives from Afghanistan, Iraq and other fronts in the so-called War on Terror were interned. \n \n Leftist groups had also called for a protest on the day of his visit next Saturday, leading Keren Hayesod's organizers to announce that they were cancelling Bush's participation on security grounds -- not because of the criminal complaints. \n \n But groups including the New York-based Human Rights Watch and International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) said the cancellation was linked to growing moves to hold Bush accountable for torture, including waterboarding. He has admitted in his memoirs and television interviews to ordering use of the interrogation technique that simulates drowning. \n \n \"He's avoiding the handcuffs,\" Reed Brody, counsel for Human Rights Watch, told Reuters. \n \n The action in Switzerland showed Bush had reason to fear legal complaints against him if he travelled to countries that have ratified an international treaty banning torture, he said. \n \n Brody is an American-trained lawyer specialized in pursuing war crimes worldwide, especially those allegedly ordered by former leaders, including Chile's late dictator Augusto Pinochet and Chad's ousted president Hissene Habre. Habre has been charged by Belgium with crimes against humanity and torture, and is currently exiled in Senegal. \n \n PROSECUTE OR EXTRADITE \n \n \"President Bush has admitted he ordered waterboarding which everyone considers to be a form of torture under international law. Under the Convention against Torture, authorities would have been obliged to open an investigation and either prosecute or extradite George Bush,\" Brody said. \n \n Swiss judicial officials have said that Bush would still enjoy a certain diplomatic immunity as a former head of state. \n \n Dominique Baettig, a member of the Swiss parliament from the right-wing People's Party, wrote to the Swiss federal government last week calling for the arrest of Bush for alleged war crimes if he came to the neutral country. \n \n Bush, in his \"Decision Points\" memoirs on his 2001-2009 presidency, strongly defends the use of waterboarding as key to preventing a repeat of the September 11 attacks on the United States. \n \n Most human rights experts consider the practice a form of torture, banned by the Convention on Torture, an international pact prohibiting torture and other cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. Switzerland and the United States are among 147 countries to have ratified the 1987 treaty. \n \n \"Whatever Bush or his hosts say, we have no doubt he canceled his trip to avoid our case. The message from civil society is clear - If you're a torturer, be careful in your travel plans. It's a slow process for accountability, but we keep going,\" the Paris-based FIDH and New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights said in a joint statement on Saturday. \n \n Sami El Hadjj, a former Al Jazeera journalist and former detainee at Guantanamo, had been due to speak at their news conference in Geneva on Monday, where they will release the 2,500-page complaint. \n \n \"I'm surprised he (Bush) would even consider visiting a country that has ratified the torture convention and which takes its responsibilities seriously,\" said Brody. \n \n \"I think George Bush's world is a very small place at the moment,\" he said. \"He may enjoy some kind of impunity in the United States, but other countries will not treat him so indulgently.\" \n \n (Editing by Mark Heinrich) ||||| President George W.

But several human rights groups had also filed criminal complaints against Bush, demanding that he be taken into custody if he stepped on Swiss soil and investigated for allegations of ordering torture. \n \n A right-wing member of the Swiss parliament also demanded last week Bush's arrest on war crimes allegations if he came to the country, according to Reuters. \n \n \n \n Swiss officials countered that, as a former head of state, Bush would be protected with a level of diplomatic immunity, and Keren Hayesod, the group that had invited Bush, said the court actions against the former president did not play into the decision to go forward with the dinner without him. \n \n \"We didn't want to put people and property in Geneva at risk. The gala is maintained but George Bush will not take part,\" the group's lawyer, Robert Equey told the Tribune de Geneve. \"The (criminal) complaints did not weigh in the decision.\" \n \n He noted protests against the G8 summit just across the border in France in 2003 that ended up rampaging through Geneva. \n \n",

Edwin Edwards and his wife, Trina, arrive with their son, Eli, at a Baton Rouge news conference, where Edwards announced his comeback bid for Congress. (Sean Gardner / Getty Images / ) \n \n He has served in prison, starred in a short-lived reality TV show and delivered enough quotable quips to fill a bookshelf in the public library. \n \n Now, in his latest exhibition of life as political performance art, Edwin Edwards \u2014 former Louisiana governor, convicted racketeer, celebrated womanizer and, at age 86, new father \u2014 announced Monday he would be a candidate for Congress. \n \n \"I've given a great deal of thought to this ... and I acknowledge that there are good reasons why I should not run ... but there are better reasons why I should,\" Edwards told reporters in Baton Rouge, La. \"I am positive I can run, and I am confident I can win.\" \n \n When last seen on the national stage, Edwards was co-starring in \"The Governor\u2019s Wife,\" an A&E; series focused on his pen-pal-turned-bride No. 3, Trina Scott. Their son, Eli, was born in August, and Edwards, accompanied by his wife, arrived at Monday\u2019s announcement pushing the boy in a stroller. \n \n The former four-term Democratic governor served more than eight years in federal prison for fraud, racketeering and extortion in connection with the state's licensing of riverboat casinos. He left prison in 2011 and has steadily maintained his innocence \u2014 though he pointed out Monday that nothing in the Constitution prevents a convicted felon from being elected to Congress. \n \n Part of a long line of populist, picaresque Louisiana governors, Edwards himself made a reference to his checkered past. \"I haven't had this much attention since the trial,\" he told reporters in making his announcement. \n \n He said improving accessibility to healthcare would be a centerpiece of his congressional campaign. He criticized the state\u2019s Republican governor, Bobby Jindal, for refusing to accept expanded Medicaid coverage under the federal Affordable Care Act, more widely known as Obamacare. \n \n Edwards served three terms as a congressman before running for governor in 1971. He served two terms in the statehouse in the 1970s and, after a four-year break, was again elected in 1983. During that term, he was acquitted of federal corruption charges but his image was badly tainted. Still, he managed a comeback for a fourth term in 1991, beating Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. The campaign\u2019s indelible bumper sticker read: \"Vote for the crook \u2014 it's important.\" \n \n The congressional seat that Edwards is pursuing is being vacated by Republican Bill Cassidy, who is running for Senate against incumbent Democrat Mary L. Landrieu. The district is centered in Baton Rouge, the state capital, extending south into coastal Louisiana. It leans strongly toward the GOP and several Republicans have already announced their designs on the seat. \n \n David Wasserman, who analyzes congressional races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, described Edward\u2019s candidacy as \"more of a side show than a legitimate threat, particularly after redistricting cut out all the African American neighborhoods in Baton Rouge. ... A Republican will eventually win this seat.\" \n \n Even if it is a sideshow, Edwards\u2019 campaign will presumably run longer than \"The Governor\u2019s Wife.\" The reality series was canceled last fall after just three episodes. \n \n mark.barabak@latimes.com \n \n Twitter: @markzbarabak ||||| Just three years after his release from federal prison, former Gov. Edwin Edwards is throwing his hat into the open race for Louisiana's 6th Congressional District. \n \n The 86-year-old Silver Fox, known for his memorable, often shocking quotes and the nearly nine years spent behind bars on extortion, fraud and racketeering charges, made the announcement at a meeting of the Press Club of Baton Rouge on Monday (March 17). \n \n \"I acknowledge there are good reasons I should not run. But there are better reasons why I should,\" said the Democrat, who served an unprecedented four terms as governor. He also put to rest questions over whether his status as an ex-con would keep him from being a qualified Congressional candidate: \"Once and for all I'm positive I can run and I'm confident I can win.\" \n \n Edwards said the decision was not an easy one, but he ended up where he was \"because I feel, I feel, that I can accomplish something if not immediately then in the long-run to help make my country a better country and properly address the needs of the 6th District.\" \n \n It also wasn't the only race he grappled with entering, Edwards said Monday, making it clear he was at one point deciding whether to challenge U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu, a fellow Democrat, for her seat. The 6th District seat will be vacant this year because U.S. Rep. Bill Cassidy, R-Baton Rouge, is challenging Landrieu. \n \n \"She's running her race and I'm running mine,\" said Edwards. Famously, there is no love lost between the two Democrats. But pundits agree the presence of each of their powerful campaign machines in Louisiana come November will be mutually beneficial for both. \n \n \n \n \"I'd like to run for governor, but there seems to be some question about whether I could,\" Edwards added. Louisiana law bars convicted felons from running for statewide office for 15 years, unless they receive a pardon. Edwards would be 101 by that time. \n \n The Marksville native and arguably Louisiana's most famous Cajun told the assembled press and public Monday that he hopes to serve on the public works and agriculture committees in Congress to address oil and gas industry and infrastructure concerns pertinent to Louisiana. \n \n On issues, he said he favors the approval of the controversial Keystone XL Pipeline and would like to spur along a study to look at securing funds for high-speed rail between Baton Rouge and New Orleans. He also said he's also been in touch with another famous Cajun -- Lt. Gen. Russel Honore -- to discuss his Green Army's environmental concerns regarding Baton Rouge's aquifer. \n \n On the Affordable Care Act, Edwards said he would not have voted it if he had been in Congress at that time because \"it is too fraught with pitfalls.\" \n \n \"(But) it is the law and we're going to have to deal with it at least until Obama is out of office,\" he added. Edwards did say, however, that he is in favor of the Medicaid expansion option available under the federal health care law known as Obamacare. \n \n \"I'm going to work in Congress in an effort to try to override the governor's decision,\" Edwards said, referring to Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal's staunch refusal to opt into the expansion, under which around 242,000 uninsured Louisianians would be covered. \n \n \n \n <a href=\"http://polldaddy.com/poll/7887466/\">Will you vote for Edwin Edwards or support his campaign now that he's announced his run for Louisiana Congressional 6th District?</a> \n \n At one point, a member of the audience asked how he would respond to opponents who say his run will engender negative national attention and be \"an embarrassment\" for the state. \n \n \"They said that last time I ran for governor, and I don't know, I hardly think it is an embarrassment to the state. It might be something the state should be proud of because forgiveness, understanding and second chances are important in life and in politics,\" said Edwards. \n \n Edwards also discussed the more than eight years he spent in federal prison; as he has in the past, he denied wrongdoing during his years as governor: \"(The trial) was not about Edwin Edwards the governor. It was about Edwin Edwards who was a friend of the people, who for reasons of their own testified falsely about our relationship after I was out of office.\" \n \n The Monday announcement did not come as a surprise, as rumors of his purported run began swirling months earlier. \n \n Edwards chances of winning in the heavily Republican district are slim, demographers and pollsters agree. But they don't deny he could make it into a runoff based solely on name recognition. The 6th District was redrawn in 2011, its odd horseshoe shape encompassing parts of southeast Louisiana from Baker, through East Baton Rouge and Ascension Parishes and down to the Houma-Thibodaux area. \n \n The field is already bloated with more than 10 Republican candidates, including a state senator and a former coastal adviser to Jindal, having already officially announced their intentions to run, with more expected to jump on in coming months. Edwards filed his candidacy papers Friday, he said, and he's already chosen a treasurer but not a campaign manager. \n \n Edwards' sixty year political career began in 1954, when he was elected to the Crowley City Council. He also served in the state Legislature and Congress. He has become a particularly divisive political figure in Louisiana, famous for his populist leanings and larger-than-life persona, infamous for being found guilty on 17 counts of bribery, extortion and fraud charges in 2000. \n \n He spent more than eight years in federal prison, where he became acquainted by mail with Trina Scott, a registered Republican 50 years his junior. She and Edwards were married soon after his release in 2011, and the two starred in an ill-fated reality TV show last year. \n \n Trina sat patiently with their 1-year-old son Eli during Edwards' speech Monday. The former governor said he and Trina made the decision he would definitely run about a week ago, adding, \"no office in the world would attract me if it means separating from my child, my children and my wife.\" \n \n Edwards has two other sons, Stephen and David, and two daughters, Victoria and Anna, from his two previous marriages. \n \n While he spent the bulk of Monday's announcement discussing the issues he'd like to focus on during his campaign, it wasn't bereft of a showing of the characteristic Edwards wit. When asked how he would convince Republicans to vote for him, he said, \"I'm going to let Trina talk to them.\" \n \n One reporter cited a Louisiana Republican Party statement calling Edwards' run part-and-parcel of his \"antics\" to remain in the spotlight. \"My antics?\" Edwards asked, \"You mean the things that got me elected so many times?\" \n \n \"I haven't had this much attention since the trial,\" Edwards quipped when he took the podium. \n \n But before he strode away, the inveterate politician in the Cajun Prince had came alive. Employing what some might say is a rather curious Latin turn-of-phrase (considering his checkered past) he asked for the support of those who love him and the reconsidering of those who don't. \n \n \"'Alea iacta est.' The die is cast. And I hope you will join with me in making this district a better district, because we have that potential.\" \n \n \n \n . . . . . .

    "document": "Woodruff, SC - The man charged with abducting an Anderson woman and keeping her chained in a metal storage shed has implicated himself in a 13-year-old unsolved murder of four at a Chesnee motorcycle shop, and is now suspected in the deaths of as many as seven people, the sheriff announced late Saturday night. \n \n Sheriff Chuck Wright said murder warrants have been drawn charging Todd Christopher Kohlhepp with the murder of four people at Superbike Motorsports in Chesnee, a quadruple slaying that occurred exactly 13 years ago Sunday. \n \n In addition, Kohlhepp, who was seen walking the property with investigators Saturday afternoon, has led authorities to where he said two other bodies are buried. Wright did not identify those individuals, nor, he said, have investigators unearthed those remains. \n \n \"Mr. Todd talked to me today and I prayed with him,\" Wright said. \"I prayed that he would find God.\" \n \n Asked how authorities were certain that Kohlhepp was responsible for the previously unsolved killings at the motorcycle shop, Wright said, \"He told us some stuff that nobody else ought to know.\" \n \n Earlier Saturday, Wright identified a body found in a shallow grave on the property Friday as that of Charles David Carver. Carver, the boyfriend of the kidnapped woman, was shot multiple times before he was buried in a shallow grave in a clearing off Wofford Road, authorities said. \n \n Wright and Coroner Rusty Clevenger delivered the news of Carver's identification during a brief update earlier Saturday night. \n \n \"We certainly wanted a different outcome than this,\" Wright said. He declined to go into detail about the ongoing investigation but said more information would be released later Saturday. \n \n Carver died of multiple gunshot wounds to the upper extremities, said Clevenger, who ruled the death a homicide. \n \n Earlier Saturday, the mother of the missing Anderson man whose girlfriend was abducted and found chained inside a storage shed told the Anderson Independent Mail that she is refusing to give up hope she will one day see her son alive. \n \n \u201cUntil I see a body, I can\u2019t give up,\u201d said Joanne Shiflet, mother of the 32-year-old Carver. \u201cFor this to be over, I have to see him.\u201d \n \n In an exclusive interview with the Independent-Mail, Shiflet said she has experienced a range of emotions since learning on Friday that Kohlhepp, 45, allegedly shot her son. Her son's girlfriend was found on Thursday chained around her neck and ankles inside a metal shed on a 95-acre tract of land owned by Kohlhepp on Wofford Road near Woodruff. \n \n The victim has told investigators that she saw Kohlhepp shoot Carver, according to 7th Circuit Solicitor Barry Barnette, who said it is likely Kohlhepp will face at least one charge of murder. \n \n Late Saturday afternoon, Kohlhepp in handcuffs and an orange jumpsuit could be seen accompanied by law enforcement authorities walking on the property. It was not immediately clear why Kohlhepp was brought to the search scene and whether he was cooperating with investigators. He was escorted off the property in an unmarked SUV less than hour later. \n \n Wright has refused to comment on Kohlhepp's appearance. \n \n Wright had previously said human remains were found on the property and that investigators fear they are dealing with the work of a serial killer. \n \n Law enforcement would soon take shifts searching the property one portion at a time, Wright added. \n \n \"This is one of the biggest crime scenes I've been involved in,\" he said. \n \n He said they were dedicated to finding any evidence on the property \"no matter how long it takes.\" \n \n Shiflet said she has been told that it may be several days before she learns whether the body is that of her son. \n \n \u201cRight now, I am just angry,\u201d said Shiflet, who lives in Starr. \n \n The pair were reported missing in early September by friends and family in Anderson. Kohlhepp has been charged with the woman's kidnapping and is being held without bond at the Spartanburg County Detention Center. \n \n Shiflet said she was in court for Kohlhepp's arraignment on Friday when she learned that the woman had told authorities she saw Kohlhepp shoot Carver. \n \n \u201cIt was like a slap in the face,\u201d Shiflet said. \n \n According to Shiflet, Carver and the woman drove from Anderson to Kohlhepp's land near Woodruff to talk to him about clearing some property for him. \n \n \u201cIt ended up being a trap,\u201d she said. \n \n Shiflet said she learned during Friday\u2019s hearing that the woman knocked on the door of a two-story garage after she and Carver arrived at the property. According to Shiflet, The victim said Carver was shot immediately after the door opened. \n \n Carver\u2019s car was found on the property Thursday. \n \n Shiflet said she and her husband and their adult children have spent much of their time at the property near Woodruff since the woman was found Thursday. She said the wait for answers has been agonizing. \n \n \u201cIt is kind of like the feeling of being seasick,\u201d Shiflet said. \n \n She described her son as a cheerful man who enjoyed helping others. \"David loved laughter. He loved making people laugh,\u201d Shiflet said. \u201cHe was always smiling.\u201d \n \n Shiflet said her son got married about three years ago. She said he and his wife separated in late May or early June. Neighbors of the couple at the Anderson Crossing Apartments said their break-up was acrimonious. \n \n Shiflet said financial problems factored into her son\u2019s failed marriage. \u201cIt was hard for David to make ends meet with only one of them working,\u201d she said. \n \n Carver met his girlfriend while working with her mother at a warehouse in Greenville, Shiflet said. They were friends at first, she said, before the woman moved into his apartment this summer. \n \n Shiflet said she was introduced to her about a week before the woman and her son went missing in late August. \n \n \u201cShe came up and gave me the biggest hug,\u201d Shiflet said. \u201cShe told me that she wanted me to know everything about her.\u201d \n \n Shiflet said she knew that her son was in love. \n \n \u201cYou could feel it,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was the first happiness that he had known for a long time.\u201d \n \n Investigators returned to the scene before sunrise Saturday to resume their search of property in Spartanburg County. As law enforcement continued to work through the morning, several local residents set up a table with snacks and water for police, media and volunteers at the property on Wofford Road near Woodruff. \n \n Among the onlookers in Woodruff was Scott Waldrop, who said his family has lived on Wofford Road for about 22 years, and who said he struck up an acquaintance with the Kohlhepp a couple of years ago shortly after Kohlhepp purchased the 95-acre property. \n \n He said Kohlhepp liked to talk a lot, and they hit it off the first time. He said Kohlhepp liked to show off his guns. Though he was not a hunter, he was a \"great marksman,\" Waldrop said. \n \n Waldrop said he helped plant trees in front of the fence lining the property and assisted posting no trespassing signs. \n \n They last communicated through text messages last week, he said. Kohlhepp had sent Waldrop a message that said, \"Remind me later to tell you about my little altercation with some hunters two weeks ago. The ran off my land in middle of dark (sic).\" \n \n Waldrop said that when he heard about Brown being discovered alive nearby he thought she had been found in a container on a four-acre piece of property the two had seen near Kohlhepp's property. He texted Kohlhepp Thursday asking him to call him as soon as possible, not knowing that Kohlhepp had been taken into custody in connection with the woman's kidnapping. \n \n Waldrop said he was shocked to she was found on Kohlhepp's land. \"It's a bad travesty,\" he said. \n \n Wright said authorities will continue the painstaking process of searching the property for as long as it takes to find answers. Wright said they had searched about 30 to 40 percent of the property since Thursday. He said they have found numerous weapons and ammunition. \n \n Several holes could be seen Friday night near the center of the property where an excavator had dug up the earth. A beige two-story garage stood nearby. Barnette said investigators found a bed with chains around it in the living space above the garage. \n \n A gravel path connected the garage to a dark green shed and storage container where the woman was kept chained. The door to the container was open, and crime scene tape cordoned off the area. \n \n In one clearing, officers could be seen collecting evidence from one of several shallow holes in the ground. ||||| In this Thursday, Nov. 3, 2016 photo, police search a field on property owned by Todd Kohlhepp where a missing woman was found chained up in a large storage container in Woodruff, S.C.

(Tim Kimzey/The Spartanburg Herald-Journal via AP) (Associated Press) \n \n WOODRUFF, S.C. (AP) \u2014 A South Carolina man killed at least seven people in a hidden crime spree that lasted more than a decade and only was uncovered when police rescued a woman chained at the neck in a storage container, authorities said Saturday. \n \n Todd Kohlhepp accepted responsibility for an unsolved massacre one day before the 13th anniversary of the deaths that stumped authorities, said Sheriff Chuck Wright, first elected a year after the murders. \n \n Kohlhepp, 45, confessed to the deaths of the owner, service manager, mechanic and bookkeeper of Superbike Motorsports, a motorcycle shop in Chesnee, in Spartanburg County. \n \n \"God answered our prayers. If it wasn't for Him answering our prayers and Todd talking to us, I don't know that we'd ever solve that case,\" Wright said. \n \n Wright says Kohlhepp also showed law enforcement officers Saturday where he says he buried two of his other victims on his 95-acre property near Woodruff. Kohlhepp, in handcuffs and wearing an orange jumpsuit, was at the site for less than an hour. \n \n Those are in addition to the body found Friday at the site. Wright and Coroner Rusty Clevenger identified that victim as 32-year-old Charles Carver, the boyfriend of the woman found Thursday in a locked metal container. \n \n Carver and the woman went missing around Aug. 31. Their last known cellphone signals led authorities to the property. \n \n The Associated Press is not naming the woman because the suspect is a sex offender, though authorities have not said whether she was sexually assaulted. \n \n Carver died of multiple gunshot wounds. An anthropologist is helping determine how long Carver was buried, Clevenger said. He declined to say how many times Carver had been shot. \n \n The sheriff says it's possible more bodies will be uncovered. \n \n The wife of one of the 2003 victims said detectives told her Kohlhepp was an angry customer who had been in the shop several times. \n \n Melissa Ponder told The Associated Press she was resigned that her husband Scott's death would never be solved before getting a phone call Saturday evening from one of the case's original detectives. \n \n Detectives told family members of all four victims of the confession at the same time. \n \n \"He knew too much about the crime scene,\" Ponder said of Kohlhepp's account to detectives. \"He knew everything.\" \n \n The Superbike killings stunned the Chesnee community, with rumors like they were committed by a Mexican drug gang or were part of a love triangle crushing the families of the victims. \n \n Melissa Ponder is glad the rumors weren't true. \n \n \"It isn't closure, but it is an answer,\" she said. \"And I am thankful for that.\" \n \n Kohlhepp was released from prison in Arizona in 2001. At 15 years old, he was convicted of raping a 14-year-old neighbor at gunpoint and threatening to kill her siblings if she called police. Kohlhepp had to register as a sex offender. \n \n But that didn't stop him from getting a South Carolina real estate license in 2006 and building a firm. \n \n Wright said \"it's strange\" that Kohlhepp managed the pretext of a normal life for so long. \n \n Scott Waldrop, who's lived next door to the Woodruff property for nearly 22 years, said he thought Kohlhepp was a serious Doomsday \"prepper\" who liked his privacy, but \"he didn't seem like a threat.\" \n \n Waldrop said when he saw the container, it was full of bottled water and canned goods. After buying the property two years ago, Kohlhepp immediately started putting a chain link fence around it. \n \n Waldrop said Kohlhepp paid him to put no trespassing signs, cut trees for him and other odd jobs around the property. Kohlhepp also installed deer cameras and put bear traps throughout. \n \n \"I was the only one he let over there, I think because I laughed at his jokes and listened to him,\" he said. \"I just hate to know somebody who's done something like this.\" \n \n Kohlhepp has a house about 9 miles away in Moore, where neighbor Ron Owen said Kohlhepp was very private, but when they did talk across the fence, he was a \"big bragger.\" \n \n Kohlhepp liked to talk about the money he made day trading online, for example, and about his two BMWs. He recently told Owen, 76, that he'd spent $80,000 on the chain link fence. \n \n \"We didn't see any signs whatsoever that this was going on,\" Owen said. \"My first reaction's a baseball bat, but I know I'm not to take that in my own hands.

He was known for reviving Fiat and Chrysler and bringing the brands together under one roof. \n \n Questions have been raised in the media over how long Marchionne had been unwell, and whether Fiat Chrysler had been informed. The automaker said it was only made aware last week of a \"serious deterioration\" in Marchionne's condition. \n \n \"Due to medical privacy, the company had no knowledge of the facts relating to Mr. Marchionne's health,\" the company said in a statement on Thursday. \n \n \"The company was made aware that Mr. Marchionne had undergone shoulder surgery and released a statement about this,\" it said. \n \n \"On Friday July 20, the company was made aware with no detail by Mr. Marchionne's family of the serious deterioration in Mr. Marchionne's condition and that as a result he would be unable to return to work,\" it added. \"The company promptly took and announced the appropriate action the following day.\" \n \n Related: Marchionne was an outsider and an original \n \n Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) had warned in its most recent annual report in February that Marchionne's ability to run the company was \"critical to the execution of our strategic direction and implementation of our business plan.\" \n \n \"We have developed succession plans that we believe are appropriate, although it is difficult to predict with any certainty that we will be able to replace these [executives] with persons of equivalent experience and capabilities,\" the company said. \n \n It's unusual for companies to require executives to disclose medical problems, according to HR professionals.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The illness and death of Fiat Chrysler's fast-charging, unconventional CEO may have seemed sudden and surprising to many, but Sergio Marchionne was apparently sick for longer than anyone\u2014even his employer\u2014knew. That news comes to the Wall Street Journal from University Hospital Zurich, which notes Marchionne had a \"serious illness\" for which he sought treatment at the hospital for more than a year. In a statement issued to get ahead of \"further speculation,\" UHZ says it gave the ailing Marchionne \"all the options offered by cutting-edge medicine,\" though it didn't detail what exactly he was being treated for. And because of patient privacy rules, Fiat Chrysler says it was in the dark about Marchionne's issues. \"The company had no knowledge of the facts relating to Mr. Marchionne's health,\" a company spokesman says, per Reuters, adding it wasn't until July 20 that it \"was made aware with no detail by Mr. Marchionne's family of the serious deterioration in Mr. Marchionne's condition.\" The reason that's important is because \"material\" information about a company is required to be divulged to shareholders under securities laws. Whether a high-level exec's health counts as \"material\" can get murky, but a company can get itself into trouble if it puts out \"half-truths or inconsistent statements,\" a Northwestern University professor tells the Journal. In February, Fiat Chrysler's annual report noted that Marchionne's hands-on involvement in the company was \"critical to the execution of our strategic direction and implementation of our business plan,\" reports CNNMoney.",

    "document": "YouTube\u2019s top trending content at the moment isn\u2019t an advertisement, music video, or movie trailer. It is not a viral challenge video, nor is it something about Fortnite. Instead, it\u2019s a shockingly raw breakup video featuring two of YouTube\u2019s biggest comedy vloggers, Liza Koshy and David Dobrik. \n \n Liza Koshy, 22, is best known for going to stores and causing improvisational mischief, often featuring random items that anyone can buy. David Dobrik, 21, has also made a name for himself through funny vlogs, many of which feature his relationship with Koshy. Combined, the two have over 21 million subscribers, making them one of the most visible power couples on the platform. Except that the two broke up six months ago, according to a video uploaded yesterday. \n \n The split may come as a surprise to some fans, given that the two have been uploading videos with each other this entire time. Just two weeks ago, Dobrik shared footage of him surprising Koshy with a puppy, and before that, there was another video in which he brings her a monkey. But according to the pair, the two had grown apart enough that staying in a relationship just didn\u2019t make sense anymore: they were leading separate lives. \n \n \u201dLiza broke up with me because she felt like we\u2019ve been kinda distant, because we\u2019ve just been so busy, period,\u201d Dobrik said. \n \n The video\u2019s popularity is not entirely thanks to the viewers who normally follow the everyday minutia of their favorite YouTubers. It\u2019s gone viral because of how obvious it is that the two deeply care for one another. They joke around, they crack up, they cry. They sing each other\u2019s praises and talk about how they\u2019re still best friends. They make jabs about future boyfriends and girlfriends. When Koshy says that she is going through something and that she needs to love herself before she can love someone else, she knows it\u2019s clich\u00e9 \u2014 so you believe her. It helps that she pokes fun at herself. \u201cThis is gonna sound so lame, but I really want to spread love but I have to have it first, you know?,\u201d Koshy says, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying you\u2019re gonna spread mayonnaise when you only have mustard.\u201d \n \n Where before partners might consider joining their banking accounts, lovers in 2018 have to think about what it means to merge their brands \n \n At this point, breakups are their own genre of video on YouTube, and plenty of couples have announced a separation in front of the camera. Where before partners might consider joining things like banking accounts or bills, lovers in 2018 have to think about what it means to merge your brand with someone else\u2019s. You don\u2019t have to be a big YouTube star to think about when you make a relationship Instagram official, how much a partner should be mentioned on your social media feeds, or even what labels you publicly use for one another. To what degree should you own your relationship online? How will that relationship define you in the eyes of others on the internet? Even a simple tagged photo carries a much bigger meaning for some of us. You don\u2019t want to give people the wrong idea about where things stand with certain people \u2014 or maybe you do want to send a very specific message out there. \n \n While most of us can simply stop tagging an ex on our social media accounts, YouTubers with channels revolving around their lives don\u2019t have that luxury. Their entire livelihoods could be at risk if they disappoint or upset the audience following them. As ridiculous as it might sound, there\u2019s a real need for disclosure regarding where they stand with those regularly featured in their videos. If nothing else, airing everything out this publicly is a preventative measure that could minimize the chance that either person will get harassed by fans who believe one person ought to be blamed for the breakup. \n \n Koshy and Dobrik know they\u2019re operating within this strange space. They waited a long time to tell YouTube fans because they were both angry that they grew apart in the first place. And while we all know that what influencers show us is just a well-edited sliver of a much bigger picture, there\u2019s a subtext of realness here. Koshy jokes that she could have wiped away her tears and fix up her appearance, but that wouldn\u2019t be authentic. You believe her. More than that: you can\u2019t help but watch and think, Man, I wish I had had a breakup as healthy as this one. ||||| This was a very very stupid idea.

He threw the animal off, but twice it jumped back onto his arms, delivering more scratches. Finally, it ran up a tree and McDonald retreated to his house. \n \n \"The first thing that goes through your mind is \u2018is it rabid?\u2019\" he said. After doing some research into the matter on the Internet, McDonald said he learned bites are the real concern with rabies infection, and squirrel attacks are quite rare. \n \n Which is why he was surprised the next day, when his wife reported hearing yelling from across the street. He said he looked to see his neighbor with a blanket and a metal pole battling a gray squirrel not unlike the one that attacked him the day before. Later, he would learn that a woman on the same street had also been attacked. \n \n While the incident is on the amusing side of the spectrum for him, McDonald said it was a bit eerie to have the squirrel not only jump him, but jump back onto him after being thrown off. \n \n \"I thought it was funny until I learned of two other people being attacked; then I thought it should be taken a little more seriously,\" he said. \n \n Local Game Warden Travis Buttle said he\u2019s spoken to two \n \n Advertisement \n \n people on East Street, but not McDonald, about the attacking squirrel. He said one woman was bitten on the back of the neck, and under advice of her doctor is undergoing a rabies vaccination series. \n \n He said there isn\u2019t much he can do unless someone manages to contain the squirrel, say in a garage or a shed. To test for rabies the animal has to be captured and destroyed. Buttle advised anyone attacked by a squirrel, or any animal, to talk to their doctor and follow the advice given. \n \n If the squirrel was rabid, Buttle said, it would likely have died of the disease by now. The disease, which affects the brains of mammals, causes them to behave oddly and in some cases aggressively. Buttle said that normally he would try to track an animal suspected of rabies, but when he got the calls on the squirrel he was two hours away and the victims reported the animal had disappeared almost immediately. \n \n Buttle said these cases are unusual because the attacks appear to be unprovoked. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

    "document": "Consumers\u2019 Guide to Highly Fluorinated Chemicals \n \n Why are highly fluorinated chemicals harmful? Highly fluorinated chemicals contain carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds, which are some of the strongest bonds in nature. That makes them both incredibly resistant to breakdown and very useful. For instance, they can make products grease or stain-resistant, nonstick, or waterproof. However, this comes at a cost. The highly fluorinated chemicals that have been well-studied have been associated with: Watch our new video \n \n \n \n To learn more, watch our short webinar testicular and kidney cancer \n \n liver malfunction \n \n hormonal changes \n \n thyroid disruption high cholesterol \n \n obesity \n \n ulcerative colitis \n \n lower birth weight and size Other highly fluorinated chemicals are suspected of similarly causing health problems, but have not been well tested. Because they are resistant to breakdown, these chemicals can persist in our bodies for years. In the environment, they can last for millions of years. This means that the highly fluorinated chemicals released during our lifetimes will build up in the environment, and many future generations will be exposed to them, at even higher levels than we are today. Scientists from all over the world signed the Madrid Statement to share their concerns about highly fluorinated chemicals and are asking for a limit to the production and use of these chemicals. Find out more here On May 1, 2015, the Madrid Statement was published in Environmental Health Perspectives, a high-impact scientific journal. Click here to read the article, here to read an accompanying editorial by distinguished scientists Linda Birnbaum and Phillipe Grandjean, here to read the reply from the chemical industry, and here for our response. \n \n How are we exposed? \n \n Highly fluorinated chemicals are used in consumer products such as cookware, clothing, outdoor apparel, carpeting, and food packaging to provide nonstick, oil- and water resistant properties. They are also used in some kinds of cosmetics. \n \n We are exposed to them by direct contact with these products, but also through the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. \n \n They have been detected at high levels in humans and wildlife all over the globe. \n \n What can you do? Ask yourself, \u201cDo I really need products that are stain-resistant, nonstick, or waterproof?\u201d Knowing the consequences, you might choose to give up some conveniences or product performance. Steps you can take: Avoid products that are oil repellant or stain resistant. \n \n Only purchase waterproof gear when you really need it. \n \n Avoid cosmetics with PTFE or any word containing \u201cperfluor\u201d or \u201cpolyfluor\u201d on their ingredients list. \n \n Replace your Teflon nonstick cookware with cast iron, glass, or ceramic. \n \n Avoid microwave popcorn and greasy foods wrapped in paper. \n \n Tell retailers and manufacturers you want products without fluorinated chemicals. \n \n Support companies committed to phasing out highly fluorinated chemicals, such as the apparel brands that have joined Greenpeace\u2019s Detox campaign, and the fast food chains that removed them from food packaging as a result of EWG\u2019s action. All products from these apparel brands will be free of highly fluorinated chemicals after those dates. You can drive change for healthy products! \n \n Resources \n \n In the Media ||||| The dust in our homes and the air we breathe harbor a complex stew of chemicals. Some, like oxygen, sustain life. Others are pollution stemming from things like car exhaust or from tiny scraps of household products. A pair of new studies adds a level of much-needed detail about exactly how widespread such toxic exposures can be. \n \n A new analysis, published Wednesday in Environmental Science & Technology, reaffirmed that consumer product chemicals including phthalates, phenols and flame retardants are ubiquitous components of household dust. These substances are present at such high levels that researchers say it is likely we are inhaling and accidentally eating small amounts of these chemicals every day, although we don't yet know whether this level of exposure is enough to do harm. \n \n Such exposures occur after the chemicals flake off of products including building materials, electrical cords or perfume, says senior author Ami Zota, a professor of environmental and occupational health at The George Washington University. To better understand the scale of such exposures she and her colleagues collected the findings of 26 peer-reviewed studies and one unpublished data set on indoor dust samples from 14 states. The samples came from urban, suburban and rural settings, and included houses as well as other locations like schools and workplaces. The 10 most common chemicals in the study were found in over 90 percent of samples, which suggests they come from items present in most people's households and communities. \n \n The most abundant chemical in the analysis was di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a phthalate that is used in flexible plastics as well as in cosmetics and personal care products. In mice and rats, ingesting high doses of DEHP interferes with the development of the male reproductive system and is linked to liver cancer. When the investigators ranked the chemicals according to how much preschool-aged children were likely to ingest, the flame retardant tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) came out on top. TCEP has been linked to cancer and brain damage in mice, but like many of these household chemicals we don't know whether it might be dangerous to humans. \n \n An important limitation of the study is that it only looked at the types and amounts of chemicals present in dust\u2014not the health of people who spent time in places where the dust was collected. For many of the chemicals, we don't yet know what amount should be considered hazardous for long-term exposure, Zota says. And we don't know whether some of the chemicals might be more harmful in combination than they are individually. \n \n Tracey Woodruff, who was not involved with the new analysis, calls the work a \u201cgreat contribution\u201d to the study of chemicals in household dust. She's the director of the Program on Reproductive Health and the Environment at the University of California, San Francisco, and she was previously a senior scientist and policy analyst at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cThe dust is out there. We know the chemicals are in the dust,\u201d she says. \u201cNow we have a better picture of what that looks like and also what we\u2019re going to be ingesting, which is really important for thinking about risks.\u201d \n \n In the Air \n \n A second study raises new questions about air exposures we might encounter outside the home. Work published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on September 6 suggests magnetite nanoparticles, typically found in the air, may travel farther than previously believed throughout the human body and ultimately lodge in human brain tissue. Such particles from air pollution have long been linked to respiratory disease, Woodruff says, but the link to brain health is \u201cnewly being appreciated.\u201d \n \n The researchers examined 37 samples of brain tissue from people who had lived in Manchester, England, and in Mexico City. They used a sensitive magnet to confirm that magnetic particles were present in the brains and then looked for the particles under a transmission electron microscope. Although our bodies produce a small amount of magnetite\u2014a mineral made of iron and oxygen\u2014specific characteristics of the magnetite particles researchers found in the brain samples suggest these substances did not come from the body. Typically, such particles appear crystal-shaped under an electron microscopic. Yet Barbara Maher, who studies magnetic minerals that occur in the environment at Lancaster University, and her team found that most of the samples from the brain were actually smooth and round. \n \n That shape, along with other clues like particle size and the presence of other metals, suggests they were produced at high temperatures\u2014likely in the engines of vehicles. \u201cIn essence they are molten droplets,\u201d Maher says. \u201dIf they cool quickly enough, they keep that spherical shape.\u201d \n \n The particles are small enough that they can enter the brain through the olfactory nerve via the nose. Nobody has yet proved that magnetite contributes to Alzheimer's or any other disease\u2014magnetite has been detected previously in the brains of some Alzheimer\u2019s patients\u2014but the mineral is known to create free radicals that can damage cells. As a result, Maher believes it is \u201chighly improbable\u201d that the particles' presence in the brain is harmless. \n \n \u201cThe levels of magnetite they found in the brain are much higher than have been found in other studies,\u201d says Jon Dobson, who studies magnetic nanoparticles in biomedicine at the University of Florida and was not involved in the study. There is a chance the high levels were from accidental contamination in the lab, in spite of the researchers' careful steps to avoid it, he says. But if the high levels are simply due to the patients being exposed to high levels of pollution, future studies involving a control group from less polluted areas could confirm the findings. \n \n Removing nanoparticles and consumer product chemicals from our environment is a big job that would require major policy changes, for example banning the most toxic chemical from products. In the meantime, though, both Zota and Woodruff note that washing your hands before you eat can significantly reduce your accidental intake of the chemicals found in dust. They also recommend vacuuming with a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, which is designed to remove very fine particles. \n \n Maher points out that walking farther away from busy roads may also help to reduce how much exhaust you breathe in. Even walking on the downhill side of the road, she says, rather than the uphill side where drivers burn more fuel as they accelerate, may make a difference. \u201cAny distance that you can put between you and the source of the particles is a good thing.\u201d ||||| TIME Health For more, visit TIME Health \n \n Ten chemicals suspected or known to harm human health are present in more than 90% of household dust samples, according to a new study. \n \n The research, published in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, adds to a growing body of evidence showing the dangers posed by exposure to a slew of chemicals people in developed countries encounter on a day-to-day basis. The chemicals come from a variety of household goods that includes toys, cosmetics, furniture, cookware and cleaning products. \n \n A class of chemicals known as phthalates \u2014 a group that includes DEP, DEHP, DNBP and DIBP \u2014 are present in the highest concentrations, according to the research. That class of chemicals is also thought to be among the most harmful. Exposure to phthalates may interrupt the endocrine system, leading to a decrease in IQ and respiratory problems, among other problems, health researchers say. \n \n Read More: You Asked: Can My Couch Give Me Cancer? \n \n Highly fluorinated chemicals (HFCs), another class of chemicals common in household dust, has been linked to kidney and testicular cancer. The compound is found in everything from cell phones to pizza boxes, according to the study. \n \n Researchers behind the study, which evaluated datasets from more than 25 prior studies, called for manufacturers to replace the chemicals in their products with safe alternatives, but, voluntary participation aside, the path to force companies to replace chemicals remains difficult. For decades, chemicals in this country have been eligible for use without tests to confirm their safety. \n \n An overhaul to the Toxic Substances Control Act passed earlier this year will require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to sign off on new chemicals before they enter the open market, but still thousands of chemicals on the market today remain untested. The Environmental Working Group, an environmental nonprofit, estimates that 1,000 of those chemicals warrant further scrutiny, but the EPA does not have the staff \u2014 or the time \u2014 to invest in such an effort. Instead, the EPA has selected a much smaller list of priority chemicals to evaluate first. \n \n The research comes as scientists increasingly understand that exposure even to very low levels of these toxic substances can damage human health. And, while exposure on any given day may be small, each exposure adds up. ||||| A new analysis of more than two dozen studies found toxic chemicals in 90 percent of household dust samples taken from 14 states. \n \n Household dust does more than collect in corners and on bookshelves full of novels you haven\u2019t gotten around to reading. A new study shows it can expose people to a wide range of potentially toxic chemicals. \n \n In what the authors are calling the first study of its kind \u2013 a meta-analysis of more than two dozen previous studies on chemicals in dust \u2013 they report that 90 percent of dust samples taken from houses in 14 states contain harmful chemicals, including one that\u2019s known to cause cancer. \n \n \u201cMost studies only measure a few chemicals so it makes it hard to understand typical exposures in homes and work places,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Ami Zota, an assistant professor of environment and occupational health at Milken Institute School of Public Health at the George Washington University, in Washington, D.C. \n \n The researchers \u2013 who also came from Harvard University, the University of California-San Francisco, Silent Spring Institute and the Natural Resources Defense Council \u2013 analyzed data from 26 peer-reviewed papers and one unpublished set of data. The collected data included 45 chemicals from five chemical classes. \n \n \u201cWe wanted to be able to draw more solid conclusions about concentrations of indoor chemicals in the U.S. by pooling data across all of these studies,\u201d Zota explained. \n \n The chemicals studied come from all sorts of common consumer goods, including furniture, personal hygiene products, flooring, baby products, cleaning supplies, fast food and food packaging. Zota said the chemicals are released into the air and then seep into dust that settles on furniture and floors. People can inhale or ingest small particles of dust or even absorb them through the skin. \n \n To analyze the previous studies, the scientists parsed the information from three different angles: the level of chemical concentration in dust, how much might be getting into our bodies, and how hazardous the chemicals are. \n \n \u201cNo matter which way we looked at it, there were some chemicals that stood out,\u201d co-author Veena Singla, a staff scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, told CBS News. The non-profit group helped to fund the study. \n \n Ten harmful chemicals were found in 90 percent of the dust samples tested. Phthalates, used in toys and vinyl flooring, among other products, occurred in the highest concentrations. \n \n They were followed by phenols, often used in cleaning products. Then came flame retardants, fragrances and perflouroalkyl substances, which are used in carpets, textiles, and leather to make them water-, oil- and stain-repellent and to create grease-proof and waterproof coatings for products such as paper plates and food packaging. \n \n \u201cPhthalates are linked to multiple health hazards, including reproductive,\u201d Signla said. \u201cAnd some flame retardants are linked to cancer.\u201d \n \n The authors of the study, published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology, were especially concerned about exposure to children, especially very young children who crawl around on the floor and put their hands in their mouths. \n \n Chemicals of top concern: \n \n TCEP - A flame retardant added to couches, baby products, electronics and other products \n \n DEP, DEHP, BBzP and DnBP \u2013 These chemicals, different varieties of phthalates, are found in an array of drugstore items like those listed above, as well as some highly processed foods and fast food. Phthalates are also linked to IQ and respiratory problems in children. \n \n PFOA and PFOS - These chemicals\u200b are found in cellphones, pizza boxes and many non-stick, waterproof and stain-resistant products. They\u2019ve been linked to developmental problems\u200b and issues with the immune, digestive, and endocrine systems. \n \n These may be worrisome when they accumulate in household dust, the researchers say. \n \n \u201cIndoor dust is a reservoir for commercial consumer product chemicals and many of these chemicals have known and suspected health effects,\u201d Zota said. \n \n \u201cThis is the first study where we can get a more comprehensive picture of chemical contamination in the home,\u201d Singla added. \u201cPrevious studies were like looking at the individual dots in an Impressionist painting. Putting this data altogether, we could see what the bigger picture is and it\u2019s really kind of scary.\u201d \n \n The authors said small amounts can add up over time and potentially impact health. \n \n \u201cOn the one hand, I wasn\u2019t that surprised, and on the other hand I was surprised to see just how bad it was. I definitely expected to see a number of toxic chemicals when we put the data together, but just the extent of it did surprise me,\u201d Singla said. \n \n The study doesn\u2019t answer all of the researchers\u2019 questions, however. There are still big gaps in knowledge about many chemicals. \n \n \u201cWe know so little about fragrance chemicals. They\u2019re a prime example of the problem of not having information on what\u2019s in our products because companies claim trade secrets,\u201d Singla said. \n \n Safer alternatives need to be developed, said Zota. \n \n \u201cOne of our objectives with this \u2013 because there are so many consumer product chemicals being used currently in commerce with incomplete health and safety information \u2013 was to conduct this analysis with the objective of helping researchers as well as decision-makers to set priorities. Which chemicals to prioritize, in terms of conducting future health assessments. As well as which chemicals to actively develop safer alternatives for,\u201d Zota said. \n \n Individuals can take a number of steps to improve safety, Singla said. \n \n In your own home, day-to-day, washing your hands\u200b\u200b with plain soap and water can cut down on the amount of dust you come into contact with. Vacuuming with a HEPA-filter, wet mopping and dusting with a damp cloth can reduce exposure to dust, as well. \n \n In the longer term, she said, \u201cThere are regulatory and legislative solutions. It does make a difference when people tell their government agencies that this matters to them and they\u2019re concerned.\u201d Singla also noted that the Natural Resources Defense Council has a petition for the FDA to ban phthalates from food, which supporters can sign online. \n \n \u201cWe think our homes are safe havens, but what we found is the surprising reality that our homes are being polluted by the products we have every day. Our choices about what we buy and the policies we support can make a real difference,\u201d Singla said. ||||| Since then, many advocates for human health have demanded overhaul of the patently \u201ctoothless\u201d law. The Toxic Substances Control Act has simply proven ineffective at banning elements linked to health problems, and many believe its premarket safety testing standards are also inadequate. (Not to mention that the law requires no safety testing for the roughly 60,000 \u201cgrandfathered\u201d substances that were already in use as of its passage in 1972.) \n \n So it is of great historical significance that after 40 years, in a Congress so divided, the U.S. House of Representative voted overwhelmingly (403 to 12) this week to pass the first ever update to the law. Even Republicans who have repeatedly voted to downsize the EPA, have in this case supported the measure to expand its power. The Senate is expected to pass the bill in coming weeks, after which President Obama is expected to sign. \n \n The product of years of negotiation, the bill was introduced in 2013 by Senators Frank Lautenberg and David Vitter. It had momentum in the moment, but several days later, Lautenberg died. The bill is named in his honor, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act. \n \n \u201cThis is an issue that many people assumed was never going to see progress because it had been so politicized, and industry and environmentalists were so diametrically opposed on how it should be handled,\u201d said Anne Kolton, vice president of communications for the American Chemistry Council (ACC), a trade group that advocates for industrial chemical manufacturers and suppliers. \u201cIt's something that, through the art of compromise, we've settled on with the environmental community and the public health community.\u201d \n \n But those communities seem less than settled. \n \n Philip Landrigan, dean for global health in the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, has for years been concerned about the cumulative effects of environmental exposures that, he believes, have \u201csubtle but far-reaching impacts on brain development that show up as lifelong impairments in cognition, ability to focus, and ability to exert executive control over impulsive, risk-taking behaviors.\u201d \n \n Among his chief concerns are brominated flame retardants used in furniture, organophosphate pesticides, phthalates used in some toys, perfluorinated compounds, which he'd like to see restricted to \u201cessential uses\u201d (where there is no substitute). Nanotechnology, too, is a concern. \u201cInvestment has exploded, but the amount of information on hazards is minute,\u201d said Landrigan. \u201cIt may turn out that there isn\u2019t much hazard, but I wouldn't be so sanguine.\u201d \n \n He\u2019s unsure if the new bill will give enough power to remove substances once they prove harmful. \u201cThis could very well fix the problem, but we won't know until the first legal judgment,\u201d said Scott Faber, vice president of government affairs for the Environmental Working Group, a self-described non-partisan organization \"dedicated to protecting human health and the environment.\" ||||| Phthalates are a group of chemicals used to make plastics more flexible and harder to break. They are often called plasticizers. Some phthalates are used as solvents (dissolving agents) for other materials. They are used in hundreds of products, such as vinyl flooring, adhesives, detergents, lubricating oils, automotive plastics, plastic clothes (raincoats), and personal-care products (soaps, shampoos, hair sprays, and nail polishes). \n \n Phthalates are used widely in polyvinyl chloride plastics, which are used to make products such as plastic packaging film and sheets, garden hoses, inflatable toys, blood-storage containers, medical tubing, and some children\u2019s toys. \n \n How People Are Exposed to Phthalates \n \n People are exposed to phthalates by eating and drinking foods that have been in contact with containers and products containing phthalates. To a lesser extent exposure can occur from breathing in air that contains phthalate vapors or dust contaminated with phthalate particles. Young children may have a greater risk of being exposed to phthalate particles in dust than adults because of their hand-to-mouth behaviors. Once phthalates enter a person\u2019s body, they are converted into breakdown products (metabolites) that pass out quickly in urine. \n \n How Phthalates Affect People\u2019s Health \n \n Human health effects from exposure to low levels of phthalates are unknown. Some types of phthalates have affected the reproductive system of laboratory animals. More research is needed to assess the human health effects of exposure to phthalates. \n \n Levels of Phthalate Metabolites in the U.S. Population \n \n In the Fourth National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals (Fourth Report), CDC scientists measured 13 phthalate metabolites in the urine of 2,636 or more participants aged six years and older who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) during 2003\u20132004. For several phthalate metabolites, results from the prior survey periods of 1999\u20132000 and 2001\u20132002 are also included in the Fourth Report. By measuring phthalate metabolites in urine, scientists can estimate the amount of phthalates that have entered people\u2019s bodies. \n \n CDC researchers found measurable levels of many phthalate metabolites in the general population. This finding indicates that phthalate exposure is widespread in the U.S. population. \n \n Research has found that adult women have higher levels of urinary metabolites than men for those phthalates that are used in soaps, body washes, shampoos, cosmetics, and similar personal care products. \n \n Finding a detectable amount of phthalate metabolites in urine does not imply that the levels of one or more will cause an adverse health effect. Biomonitoring studies on levels of phthalate metabolites provide physicians and public health officials with reference values so that they can determine whether people have been exposed to higher levels of these chemicals than are found in the general population. Biomonitoring data can also help scientists plan and conduct research on exposure and health effects. \n \n Additional Resources \n \n Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry \n \n Public Health Statement for Di-n-butyl Phthalate \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=857&tid=167 \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=857&tid=167 Public Health Statement for Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=376&tid=65 \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=376&tid=65 Public Health Statement for Diethyl Phthalate \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=601&tid=112 \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=601&tid=112 Public Health Statement for Di-n-octylphthalate (DNOP) \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=971&tid=204 \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=971&tid=204 ToxFAQs for Di-n-butyl Phthalate \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=858&tid=167 \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=858&tid=167 ToxFAQs for Di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=377&tid=65 \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=377&tid=65 ToxFAQs for Diethyl Phthalate \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=602&tid=112 \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=602&tid=112 ToxFAQs for Di-n-octylphthalate (DNOP) \n \n https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=972&tid=204 \n \n Environmental Protection Agency \n \n Consumer Fact Sheet on Di (2- ethyhexyl) Phthalate \n \n https://www.epa.gov/safewater/pdfs/factsheets/soc/phthalat.pdf \n \n https://www.epa.gov/safewater/pdfs/factsheets/soc/phthalat.pdf Dibutyl phthalate \n \n https://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0038.htm \n \n https://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0038.htm Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) \n \n https://www.epa.gov/iris/subst/0014.htm \n \n Food and Drug Administration \n \n Phthalates and Cosmetic Products \n \n https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductandIngredientSafety/SelectedCosmeticIngredients/ucm128250.htm \n \n National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health ||||| (CNN) When was the last time you dusted your house? \n \n Your answer could reveal a lot about your home habits, but the findings of a new study might have everyone upping their game -- and potentially keeping wet wipes and hand sanitizer nearby at all times. \n \n Researchers at George Washington University say 45 toxic chemicals are found commonly in your house dust, with 10 of them lurking in 90% of homes across the country. \n \n \"We wanted to identify which chemicals were present at the highest exposure in homes,\" said Dr. Ami Zota , an assistant professor of environmental occupational health who led the study. \"Some chemicals were in virtually every dust sample.\" \n \n To reveal which potential toxins we're being exposed to in the comfort of our own homes, Zota's team analyzed all studies that have sampled indoor environments in the United States since 2000. They looked for the presence of potentially toxic chemicals and divided them into five classes of chemicals, two of which were found to be more common than the rest: phthalates and flame retardants. \n \n \"Many of the top 10 fall into these two categories,\" Zota said. \n \n But when factoring in the wide range of chemicals we're exposed to, small amounts can add up, she stressed. \n \n Lurking in the dust \n \n The chemicals found in dust samples came from a range of things typically found inside your home, including vinyl products -- such as flooring -- cosmetics, baby products, furniture and nail polish. \n \n To understand how these chemicals are entering your home, it helps to understand where they are used. Phthalates make plastic softer and more flexible, so they tend to be found in vinyl (PVC) materials such as flooring, blinds and food packaging. Flame retardants help products meet flammability standards that are built into building codes, insurance requirements and fire regulations. \n \n The other three classes of chemicals found in dust samples included environmental phenols, usually used as preservatives in personal care products like shampoo; fluorinated chemicals, used as stain- and water-repellent treatments for upholstery, carpets and clothes and in nonstick pans; and fragrances. \n \n Only one chemical used in fragrances had been the topic of a study, meaning many more chemicals are likely to be present in dust with little insight into them, according to the researchers. \"We know very little about the health hazard of these fragrances,\" said Zota. \n \n But the researchers note that it is about more than exposure. For example, phthalates were detected in the highest concentrations in the study, but the chemicals found in flame retardants had the \"highest estimated intake,\" meaning they are more likely to enter the body. \n \n \"You can breathe it in and can absorb into your skin,\" Zota said. \"These chemicals are not bound to the products, so they can migrate out.\" \n \n A risk to child development \n \n One of the biggest concerns underlying the presence of these chemicals hiding in house dust is the fact that children are most likely to inhale or ingest them as they crawl around, touching things and inevitably placing their hands in their mouths multiple times a day. \n \n \"Environmental insults during early development can have long-lasting adverse health effects that persist across the lifespan,\" Zota said. Phthalate exposure in children \"can increase risk of respiratory, behavioral and neurodevelopmental problems.\" \n \n Phthalates are also known to disrupt hormones inside the body, meaning they could cause reproductive problems. \n \n \"We know from lead that exposures are not acceptable,\" said Dr. Asa Bradman, associate director for exposure assessment at the Center for Environmental Research and Child's Health at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the new study. \n \n \"There's a strong argument to reduce exposure to children whose brains are changing and bodies are developing.\" \n \n As for the study findings, Bradman noted that the reason phthalates were found to be most common in house dust was probably because most studies have been done on this class of chemicals. \n \n \"By compiling information in this way, there's always the possibility of exposures that haven't been studied yet,\" Bradman said. \n \n Preventing exposure \n \n Some advice to prevent exposure, other than regularly dusting your home, is to veer away from the traditional feather duster and use a powerful vacuum with a HEPA filter to ensure that all dust particles are sucked up. Regular hand-washing -- which has a multitude of benefits -- will also reduce exposure to flame retardants found on the surfaces of furniture. \n \n The Silent Spring Institute has created an app to help people understand more about their environmental exposures, aptly named Detox Me \n \n Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n But both Zota and Bradman stress that there needs to be more research into the range of chemicals people are exposed to at home and changes at the policy level to reduce the number of chemicals entering people's households, through bans, better regulation and improved underlying chemistry during production. \n \n \"There may be chemicals out there that we don't know about, that we should know about,\" said Bradman, whose own research looks into exposure risks, particularly among children. His studies have found phthalates to be common in child care practices in the United States. \n \n \"But we can also reformulate materials so that chemicals don't just go into our bodies,\" he added. \"There may be ways to have better adhesion [of flame retardants to furnishings] so they don't get into the environment.\" \n \n The issue is also not specific to the United States. \n \n \"These consumer product chemicals are widely used throughout the globe and have been detected in homes in the UK and other European countries,\" Zota said, adding, \"since the European Union has different chemical regulations than the US, the average levels for some of the chemicals may be different than those we found for US homes.\"",

Ten chemicals that may be hazardous to our health were found in over 90% of indoor dust samples taken for a study published in the Environmental Science & Technology journal. And these chemicals are found in everyday items, including ones you may suspect (e.g., cleaning products, cellphones) and ones that may surprise you (toys, pizza boxes). Two of the most common toxins are phthalates\u2014chemicals used to make plastics more flexible and thought to be linked to harmful effects on the endocrine system, which can lower IQ and lead to breathing troubles\u2014and highly fluorinated chemicals, or HFCs, used to make items nonstick or waterproof but which are also tied to testicular and kidney cancer, thyroid issues, and liver malfunction, among other problems. In what the study's authors say is the first mega-study of its kind, they scrutinized data from 26 past studies and one unpublished one, with dust containing 45 chemicals collected from homes, schools, and workplaces in 14 states, per Scientific American. The Toxic Substances Control Act was updated earlier this year, per the Atlantic, but the law only requires new chemicals get a green light from the EPA\u2014leaving about 1,000 examination-worthy chemicals already on the market that the agency doesn't have the resources to study. \"We think our homes are safe havens, but \u2026 the surprising reality [is] that our homes are being polluted by the products we have every day,\" co-author Veena Singla tells CBS News.

The study, published in Environmental Science & Technology, analyzed 26 peer-reviewed studies on indoor dust samples from 14 states and found the 10 most common chemicals were found in more than 90% of samples, which suggests they're present in most people's homes and communities. The most abundant chemical in the analysis was di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), a phthalate that is used in flexible plastics as well as in cosmetics and personal care products. In mice and rats, ingesting high doses of DEHP interferes with the development of the male reproductive system and is linked to liver cancer. When the investigators ranked the chemicals according to how much preschool-aged children were likely to ingest, the flame retardant tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) came out on top. TCEP has been linked to cancer and brain damage in mice, but like many of these toxic exposures, it's also present in products like car exhaust and tiny scraps of household products. The researchers say it's likely we're inhaling and accidentally eating small amounts of these chemicals every day, \"although we don't yet know whether this level of exposure is enough to do harm.\" (New research has found evidence that highly fluorinated chemicals can cause cancer, which has been linked to prostate cancer.",

The company has a market value of 6.8 billion euros ($8.6 billion), down from a peak of more than 300 billion euros in 2000. \n \n Cash Burn \n \n The job cuts, 3,700 of which will take place in Finland, amount to almost a fifth of the total excluding a joint venture with Siemens AG. (SIE) Elop had already announced more than 10,000 job cuts across the company. He said in April that Nokia would speed up a cost-cut program and take further actions if needed. \n \n \u201cThis is harder than we thought and we\u2019re having to make deeper changes,\u201d Elop said today on a conference call. He said Nokia has enough net cash to go through the transition and \u201cthe scope of today\u2019s changes is designed to ensure this remains true.\u201d \n \n A substantial drop in sales could be enough to burn through most of the company\u2019s cash and \u201cbring into question Nokia\u2019s very survival,\u201d Societe Generale said last month. Nokia, which had its ratings cut to junk by Standard & Poor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings in April, said it had net cash of 4.9 billion euros as of March 31. \n \n Takeover Target? \n \n The cost of insuring Nokia bonds using credit-default swaps rose to its highest since May 25, when it reached a record. It jumped 87 basis points, or 11 percent, to 853 basis points, according to Bloomberg prices. Swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt agreements. \n \n Nokia has lost more than 70 billion euros in market value since Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007, taking the lead in smartphone innovation. While Nokia\u2019s falling value brings it closer to becoming a takeover target, the company needs to stabilize its business to attract suitors, said Lars Soederfjell, an analyst with Bank of Aaland in Stockholm. \n \n \u201cWould you buy into this, with these type of fundamentals?\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s too much uncertainty.\u201d \n \n Lumia Demand \n \n To challenge Apple and handset makers using Google Inc.\u2019s Android software, Elop adopted Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)\u2019s Windows Phone, abandoning Nokia\u2019s homegrown Symbian operating system. Nokia shipped more than 2 million Lumia smartphones running Windows Phone last quarter, while Apple sold 35.1 million iPhones. \n \n Elop today reiterated Nokia\u2019s commitment to Windows Phone, saying however that progress with the products has been \u201cslower than we would like.\u201d \n \n Nokia\u2019s total handset shipments declined 24 percent in the first quarter, allowing Samsung to overtake the company as the world\u2019s biggest mobile-phone maker. Nokia\u2019s operating margin for mobile phones plunged to 3.7 percent last year from more than 20 percent before Apple introduced the iPhone in 2007. \n \n \u201cWe don\u2019t have Nokia returning to profitability in devices in the foreseeable future, not this year and not next,\u201d Peterc said. \n \n The job cuts are are aimed at accelerating Nokia\u2019s cost- reduction efforts. The company now targets additional savings of about 1.6 billion euros, aiming to bring annual expenses at its devices business to about 3 billion euros by the end of 2013. That\u2019s down from 5.35 billion euros in 2010. \n \n Killing Projects \n \n The company will close a manufacturing plant in Salo, Finland, and facilities in Ulm, Germany, and Burnaby, British Columbia. The cuts and closures will result in expenses of about 1 billion euros, Nokia said. \n \n The biggest share of cuts will come in research and development, where Nokia is killing whole projects to preserve others that are more important, Chief Financial Officer Timo Ihamuotila said on a call. Sales is the second-biggest area affected and general overhead is third, he said. \n \n Elop promoted Timo Toikkanen, Nokia\u2019s head of business development, to take over from McDowell as executive vice president for low-end phones. Tuula Rytilae will become chief marketing officer, replacing DeVard. Savander\u2019s title was executive vice president of markets. \n \n Chris Weber, who introduced the Lumia line in North America as the head of U.S. operations, will become executive vice president of sales and marketing. Juha Putkiranta was named to a new job of executive vice president of operations. \n \n The company also agreed to sell its Vertu luxury-phone unit to Swedish private-equity firm EQT Partners AB, without disclosing terms. The companies were discussing a deal at about 200 million euros, people with knowledge of the matter said earlier this week. \n \n Nokia had 53,553 workers at the end of March, excluding the network-gear joint venture with Siemens. Including Nokia Siemens Networks, the company employed 122,148 people, down 6.7 percent from a year earlier. \n \n Nokia Siemens, which also is struggling to return to profit, is cutting 17,000 jobs worldwide to save 1 billion euros in annual operating expenses and production costs by 2013. \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Diana ben-Aaron in Helsinki at dbenaaron1@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Kenneth Wong at kwong11@bloomberg.net ||||| 1 of 5. Jekaterina Kapanen (R) leaves the Nokia mobile phone plant, after Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop's statement that was relayed by video link to employees in Nokia locations around Finland, in Salo, south-western Finland, June 14, 2012. Loss-making Finnish cellphone maker Nokia plans to cut another 10,000 jobs globally in its biggest revamp in recent history, while it warned the second-quarter loss from its cellphone business would be larger than expected. The cuts, which include the closure of Nokia's only plant in Finland, bring total planned job cuts at the group since Elop took over as chief executive in 2010 to more than 40,000. \n \n PARIS (Reuters) - Nokia plans to cut 10,000 more jobs, bringing the total to one in three staff, as it loses market share to cellphone rivals Apple and Samsung and burns through cash, raising new fears over its future. \n \n In a second profit warning in nine weeks, Nokia said on Thursday that its phone business would post a deeper-than-expected loss in the second quarter due to tougher competition, which it expected to continue. \n \n Once the world's dominant mobile phone provider, Nokia was wrongfooted by the rise of smartphones and is struggling to keep up with Apple, Samsung and Google. It is also losing market share in cheaper, more basic phones. \n \n Chief Executive Stephen Elop is placing hopes of a turnaround on a new range of smartphones called Lumia, which use largely untried Microsoft Corp software. But Lumia sales have so far been slow, exasperating investors who have seen its stock crash more than 70 percent since it announced the software switch in February 2011. \n \n \"The job cuts and profit warning underline the seriousness of the challenges Nokia is facing, particularly in light of the eye-watering competition from Apple and Samsung,\" said Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight. \n \n Nokia, whose cash position is increasingly scrutinized by investors, also said restructuring-related cash outflows would be around 650 million euros in the remaining three quarters of 2012 and around 600 million in 2013. \n \n With the cost of Nokia's debt rising, the most bearish of analysts in a Reuters poll last month said the company could even be at risk of default if it fails to slow its cash burn. \n \n Over the past five quarters, the onetime darling of mobile telcoms has eroded its cash pile by 2.1 billion euros - a rate that would wipe out its entire 4.9 billion reserves in a couple of years. \n \n Analysts at JP Morgan said on Thursday they expect operating losses, combined with restructuring outflows, to leave Nokia with 1.63 billion euros cash at the end of next year. \n \n \"This is not a comfort zone for a company as large as Nokia,\" the analysts said. \n \n Nokia's five-year credit default swaps (CDS) were at a new all-time high of 933 basis points on Thursday according to Markit. This means it costs $933,000 annually to buy $10 million of protection against a Nokia default using a five-year CDS contract and implies a default probability of 55 percent. \n \n Bernstein analyst Pierre Ferragu said he expects the company to have minimal net cash position at the end of its restructuring. \n \n \"We therefore see continued potential downside to the recent stock price and maintain our underperform rating,\" Ferragu said. \n \n Shares in Nokia were down 16 percent to 1.87 euros, below the psychologically important 2 euros mark, not seen since 1996. \n \n Analysts have said that even with the dramatic fall in the share price, the worsening outlook made it hard to judge how much lower the shares could go. \n \n \"I won't comment on the stock price anymore, since it's been seen over and over, that there is no definitive bottom,\" said Evli analyst Mikko Ervasti. \n \n \"People are worried over Lumia sales. I think expectations for the third quarter will be cut,\" said Nordea analyst Sami Sarkamies. \n \n The 10,000 job cuts, which include the closure of Nokia's only plant in its homeland Finland, bring total planned cuts at the group since Elop took over as chief executive in 2010 to more than 40,000 staff, or every third worker. \n \n Of the latest job cuts, 3,700 will take place in Finland, where the firm will also close its plant in Salo - the last major cellphone manufacturing site in western Europe, the cradle of the global industry. \n \n \"This is a major blow. This is due to the operational mistakes made already during the previous CEOs. Maybe the signs of success are running low for Elop too,\" said Antti Rinne, chairman of labor union Pro. \n \n Nokia said it expects its operating margin in the second quarter to be below the negative 3 percent level reported in the first quarter due to pressure on its smartphone business. It previously forecast it would be similar to or below that level. \n \n On average analysts forecast the second-quarter phone unit margin to be at -4.6 percent, narrowing to -2.2 percent in the third quarter. \n \n Nokia also said it would sell luxury phone business Vertu to venture firm EQT and revamp its management team.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Even rose-colored glasses can't make Nokia's situation look any brighter. The company today announced that it would cut another 10,000 jobs, which Reuters points out is one out of every five slots at its once-formidable global cellphone business. The news was accompanied by the warning that its main mobile devices unit would post an even bigger operating loss than expected, as Nokia faces competition from Apple and Google that it admits affected it \"to a somewhat greater extent than previously expected,\" reports the Wall Street Journal. The cuts will be made by the end of 2013, and will add up to $2 billion in cost reductions by the end of that year. The overhaul, CEO Stephen Elop's biggest to date, extends to the top, with the company's CMO and heads of markets and mobile phones to step down by month-end. Bloomberg reports that sites in Finland, Germany, and Canada will also be shuttered, and notes that the stock has hit its lowest price since 1996. Since Elop took over in the fall of 2010, nearly 40,000 jobs have been eliminated; Nokia currently employs 122,000, some 53,000 of which work in its mobile devices unit.",
