    "document": "Yes, of course, presidents have no direct control over gas prices. But the American people know something about this president and his disdain for oil. The \u201cfuel of the past,\u201d he contemptuously calls it. To the American worker who doesn\u2019t commute by government motorcade and is getting fleeced every week at the pump, oil seems very much a fuel of the present \u2014 and of the foreseeable future. \n \n President Obama incessantly claims energy open-mindedness, insisting that his policy is \u201call of the above.\u201d Except, of course, for drilling: \n \n \u25cfoff the Mid-Atlantic coast (as Virginia, for example, wants); \n \n \u25cfoff the Florida Gulf Coast (instead, the Castro brothers will drill near there); \n \n \u25cfin the broader Gulf of Mexico (where drilling in 2012 is expected to drop 30 percent below pre-moratorium forecasts); \n \n \u25cfin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (more than half the size of England, the drilling footprint being the size of Dulles International Airport); \n \n \u25cfon federal lands in the Rockies (where leases are down 70 percent since Obama took office). \n \n But the event that drove home the extent of Obama\u2019s antipathy to nearby, abundant, available oil was his veto of the Keystone pipeline, after the most extensive environmental vetting of any pipeline in U.S. history. It gave the game away because the case for Keystone is so obvious and overwhelming. Vetoing it gratuitously prolongs our dependence on outside powers, kills thousands of shovel-ready jobs, forfeits a major strategic resource to China, damages relations with our closest ally, and sends billions of oil dollars to Hugo Chavez, Vladimir Putin and already obscenely wealthy sheiks. \n \n Obama boasts that, on his watch, production is up and imports down. True, but truly deceptive. These increases have occurred in spite of his restrictive policies. They are the result of Clinton- and Bush-era permitting. This has been accompanied by a gold rush of natural gas production resulting from new fracking technology that has nothing at all to do with Obama. \n \n \u201cThe American people aren\u2019t stupid,\u201d Obama said (Feb. 23), mocking \u201cDrill, baby, drill.\u201d The \u201conly solution,\u201d he averred in yet another major energy speech last week, is that \u201cwe start using less \u2014 that lowers the demand, prices come down.\u201d Yet five paragraphs later he claimed that regardless of \u201chow much oil we produce at home . . . that\u2019s not going to set the price of gas worldwide.\u201d \n \n So: Decreasing U.S. demand will lower oil prices, but increasing U.S. supply will not? This is ridiculous. Either both do or neither does. Does Obama read his own speeches? \n \n Obama says of drilling: \u201cThat\u2019s not a plan.\u201d Of course it\u2019s a plan. We import nearly half of our oil, thereby exporting enormous amounts of U.S. wealth. Almost 60 percent of our trade deficit \u2014 $332 billion out of $560 billion \u2014 is shipped overseas to buy crude. \n \n Drill here and you stanch the hemorrhage. You keep those dollars within the U.S. economy, repatriating not just wealth but jobs and denying them to foreign unfriendlies. Drilling is the single most important thing we can do to spur growth at home while strengthening our hand abroad. \n \n Instead, Obama offers what he fancies to be the fuels of the future. You would think that he\u2019d be a tad more modest today about his powers of divination after the Solyndra bankruptcy, the collapse of government-subsidized Ener1 (past makers of the batteries of the future) and GM\u2019s suspension of production \u2014 for lack of demand \u2014 of another federally dictated confection, the flammable Chevy Volt. \n \n Deterred? Hardly. Our undaunted seer of the energy future has come up with his own miracle fuel: algae. \n \n Why, explained Obama, \u201cwe can grow it right here in the United States.\u201d (Sounds like a miraculous local find \u2014 except that it grows just about everywhere on earth.) Accordingly, yet another $14 million of taxpayer money will be sprinkled on algae research by Steven Chu\u2019s Energy Department. \n \n This is the very same Dr. Chu who famously said in 2008 that he wanted U.S. gas prices to rise to European levels of $8-$10 a gallon \u2014 and who on Tuesday, eight months before Election Day, publicly recanted before Congress, Galileo-style. \n \n Who do they think they\u2019re fooling? An oil crisis looms, prices are spiking \u2014 and our president is extolling algae. After Solyndra, Keystone and promises of seaweed in their gas tanks, Americans sense a president so ideologically antipathetic to fossil fuels \u2014 which we possess in staggering abundance \u2014 that he is utterly unserious about the real world of oil in which the rest of us live. \n \n High gasoline prices are a major political problem for Obama. They are not just a pain at the pump, however. They are a constant reminder of three years of a rigid, fatuous, fantasy-driven energy policy that has rendered us scandalously dependent and excessively vulnerable. \n \n letters@charleskrauthammer.com ||||| To be a modern Republican in good standing, you have to believe \u2014 or pretend to believe \u2014 in two miracle cures for whatever ails the economy: more tax cuts for the rich and more drilling for oil . And with prices at the pump on the rise, so is the chant of \u201cDrill, baby, drill.\u201d More and more, Republicans are telling us that gasoline would be cheap and jobs plentiful if only we would stop protecting the environment and let energy companies do whatever they want. \n \n Thus Mitt Romney claims that gasoline prices are high not because of saber-rattling over Iran , but because President Obama won\u2019t allow unrestricted drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Meanwhile, Stephen Moore of The Wall Street Journal tells readers that America as a whole could have a jobs boom, just like North Dakota , if only the environmentalists would get out of the way. \n \n The irony here is that these claims come just as events are confirming what everyone who did the math already knew, namely, that U.S. energy policy has very little effect either on oil prices or on overall U.S. employment. For the truth is that we\u2019re already having a hydrocarbon boom, with U.S. oil and gas production rising and U.S. fuel imports dropping. If there were any truth to drill-here-drill-now, this boom should have yielded substantially lower gasoline prices and lots of new jobs. Predictably, however, it has done neither. \n \n Why the hydrocarbon boom? It\u2019s all about the fracking. The combination of horizontal drilling with hydraulic fracturing of shale and other low-permeability rocks has opened up large reserves of oil and natural gas to production. As a result, U.S. oil production has risen significantly over the past three years, reversing a decline over decades, while natural gas production has exploded. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Given this expansion, it\u2019s hard to claim that excessive regulation has crippled energy production. Indeed, reporting in The Times makes it clear that U.S. policy has been seriously negligent \u2014 that the environmental costs of fracking have been underplayed and ignored. But, in a way, that\u2019s the point. The reality is that far from being hobbled by eco-freaks, the energy industry has been given a largely free hand to expand domestic oil and gas production, never mind the environment. \n \n Photo \n \n Strange to say, however, while natural gas prices have dropped, rising oil production and a sharp fall in import dependence haven\u2019t stopped gasoline prices from rising toward $4 a gallon. Nor has the oil and gas boom given a noticeable boost to an economic recovery that, despite better news lately, has been very disappointing on the jobs front.",

Trying to develop alternative fuels of the future is a waste of time and resources. \"Drilling is the single most important thing we can do to spur growth at home while strengthening our hand abroad,\" writes Krauthammer. High gas prices are \"a constant reminder of three years of a rigid, fatuous, fantasy-driven energy policy that has rendered us scandalously dependent and excessively vulnerable.\"  But calls for more drilling are just \"intellectual bankruptcy,\" argues Paul Krugman in the New York Times. America is already in a \"hydrocarbon boom,\" with oil and natural gas production on the rise, but that has not stopped oil prices from soaring. That's because increasing demand from developing countries and Mideast war worries \"easily outweigh any downward pressure on prices from rising US production.\" The hydrocarbon boom has also had little effect on jobs\u2014the 70,000 jobs gained since the middle of the last decade represent just .05% of total US employment. So why the GOP focus on fossil fuels? One, the oil and gas lobby.

    "document": "What happened to Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, and where is it now? \n \n Statistical tools can\u2019t answer those questions any more definitively than Malaysian officials have. Yet they can help refine and focus the hunt for the plane and for a solution to the deepening mystery of its March 8 disappearance. \n \n Bayesian statisticians are particularly helpful in a search operation. Their methods allow hunters to update their estimates of the probability of finding their target in any latitude-longitude combination \u2014 or even in three dimensions, accounting for depth in the water. Bayesians helped hunt U-boats in World War II, a U.S. submarine in the 1960s and an Air France jet in 2011. \n \n There\u2019s a fourth dimension to the current search: the cause of the disappearance. New developments, such as information about how the plane\u2019s communication systems were shut off, have lowered the probability that the plane disappeared because of an accident and increased the likelihood of deliberate diversion. Which explanation is the current leader, in turn, affects the probability of finding the plane at any given location: A deliberate act has made spots farther from the takeoff point of Kuala Lumpur more likely. \n \n Bayesian inference formalizes what will seem, to many unfamiliar with it, like common sense. Its founding principle is that most new situations can be assessed and assigned probabilities: How likely is this restaurant to be good? How likely is this cough to be a cold? How likely is Duke to win the NCAA title? \n \n Our first estimate of these probabilities may be no better than an educated guess. For example, we know that 60 percent of our restaurant meals in town have been good, or that Duke has won titles in four of the last 25 seasons (16 percent). \n \n Then we start layering new information. The restaurant is full. Now we can feel more confident in our choice: All of our good meals in town have been in full restaurants, but just half of our bad meals have been. What is the chance of a good meal, given that a restaurant is full? It\u2019s 75 percent, based on this new information, since 75 percent of meals in full restaurants have been good. Before ordering, we check our favorite food-review website and see that the place has four and a half stars out of five. Every meal we\u2019ve eaten at restaurants rated that highly has been good, but just half of our meals at restaurants with lower ratings have been. So we update our probability again, accounting for any overlap between full restaurants and highly rated ones \u2014 until we eat, when probability is no longer a relevant concept because our mouths are full. \n \n Apply the same ideas to Duke, and you might examine the Blue Devils\u2019 current ranking, their recent games, the probability FiveThirtyEight\u2019s model and others assign to the team\u2019s title hopes, and other tools to update that coarse, 16 percent probability. \n \n These examples require calculation of a single probability. Targeting a search in an area requires a probability estimate for every point in that area, really a probability distribution. Initially, we might guess that the probability is uniform: The object of interest is equally likely to be at any point. Then we update that distribution based on new information, such as \u2014 in the case of a missing plane \u2014 flight path, wind, ocean flow and which areas have been searched already. \n \n This approach has informed water searches for sunken treasure, for men overboard and for plane-crash debris, said Lawrence D. Stone, chief scientist at Metron Scientific Solutions, who has worked on many of these searches. Among them: the hunt for the remnants of Air France Flight 447, which crashed in 2009 en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 people on board. \n \n Stone and his team\u2019s methods helped inform a fifth Air France search two years after the crash, after four other efforts failed. Within six days, they found the wreck, and helped to show that the crash likely occurred because of pilot error in response to autopilot mode disengaging. After waiting nearly two years to understand their relatives\u2019 disappearance, passengers\u2019 families finally had answers. \u201cWe were very pleasantly surprised,\u201d Stone said by email. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t always happen this way.\u201d \n \n Among the challenges is finding basic information about which areas have already been searched. \u201cSearch managers typically assume the search will be resolved quickly; only when it drags on do they realize they should have employed better record-keeping from the start,\u201d Colleen M. Keller, a Metron senior analyst who worked with Stone on the Air France hunt, said by email. \u201cWithout good records, it will be very difficult for us to reconstruct and credit the current search effort.\u201d \n \n Even with ample data, Bayesian hunters must quantify subjective judgment, \u201cusing expert testimonies and imagination,\u201d as Nozer Singpurwalla, a professor of risk analysis and management science at the City University of Hong Kong, put it in an email. \n \n The Metron team outlined its success in a paper that makes plain the subjectivity inherent to the approach. For instance, the team had to account for the possibility that an earlier search covered an area including the wreckage site but missed it. So they examined each prior search, one by one. \n \n In the second search, in June and July 2009, two U.S. Navy ships listened for acoustic signals from beacons on the flight data recorder (also called the black box) and the cockpit voice recorder. Searchers designed the ships\u2019 path to ensure that they got within 1,730 meters (a little over a mile) of every point in the area of the Atlantic they were scanning. Metron searchers had to calculate the probability that this search failed not because it was in the wrong area but because the beacons malfunctioned. This step alone, critical in determining how likely it was that a repeat search in that area would yield the wreckage, required several intuitive estimates, or educated guesses, if you like. \n \n First, the scientists calculated the probability the beacon would be heard within 1,730 meters as at least 90 percent. Then they capped that probability at 90 percent, based on learning from past searches that \u201cdetection estimates based on manufacturers\u2019 specifications and operator estimates tend to be optimistic.\u201d \n \n \u201cI had been burned a couple of times before by optimistic sensor performance estimates,\u201d Stone said. \n \n Next they had to account for the possibility the beacons had been damaged in the crash. This, too, required extrapolating from past crashes, which yielded an 80 percent probability each beacon was unscathed. But how close together were the beacons \u2014 and if one beacon was damaged, was the other more likely to be? Or was the probability of either one being damaged independent? The scientists figured there was a 25 percent chance of independence and 75 percent chance of dependence. That, in turn, yielded a probability of 77 percent that if the wreck were in that area, the beacon search would have turned it up. And that was just one piece of one adjustment to the scientists\u2019 estimate of where they might find the plane wreckage. \n \n This method may sound like making up numbers, but to advocates of Bayesian techniques, applying a rigorous framework to expert subjective judgment is valuable. \u201cThis is one of the strengths of the Bayesian method,\u201d Stone said. \u201cWe did not have a thousand examples of AF447-like crashes to guide us. This is when the Bayesian approach is most useful.\u201d \n \n There are far fewer than 1,000 examples of past missing airplanes to guide the current search \u2014 just 80 since 1948, according to the Aviation Safety Network. Only two planes in the last seven years disappeared for at least 10 days: Adam Air Flight 574, in 2007; and Air France Flight 447. That makes subjective judgment a crucial input into the search, whether it\u2019s being done qualitatively, or quantitatively using Bayesian methods. \n \n Keller said Metron isn\u2019t involved in the Malaysia Airlines hunt. If it were, the same principles would apply: Start with all data, such as radar, visual or acoustic measurements, transmissions from the plane and so on. Then update to account for unsuccessful searches, and keep updating as new information comes in. \u201cBayesian search theory allows flexibility in this way and even accommodates conflicting information,\u201d Keller said. \u201cNothing is discounted.\u201d \n \n The extra layers of complexity in the Malaysia Airlines search \u2014 the new estimates of the plane\u2019s location, mounting evidence that a deliberate act caused the disappearance \u2014 complicate the Bayesian calculations and estimates. \n \n Bradley Efron, a Stanford University statistician, said the complications make Bayes a bad fit for the Malaysia Airlines hunt. \u201cBayes\u2019 Rule is good for refining reasonable (or at least not unreasonable) prior experience on the basis of new evidence,\u201d Efron, who also expressed skepticism to Al Jazeera America, wrote in an email. \u201cIt is not good when new evidence changes the situation drastically.\u201d \n \n But Tony O\u2019Hagan, professor emeritus of probability and statistics at the University of Sheffield in the U.K., said that\u2019s the perfect situation for Bayesian techniques, which should make searchers most effective in adapting to changing information, so long as they properly assume from the get-go that the plane might not be in the initial search area. \n \n Other advocates of Bayesian stats pointed to their usefulness in bringing discipline to what can be a difficult search process. Citing the work of Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky on decision-making, O\u2019Hagan said, \u201cPeople have two modes of thinking. There\u2019s a quick, instinctive mode and a slow, thoughtful mode. When problems are important enough, we need to force ourselves into the second mode \u2014 and Bayesian methods are exactly what we need.\u201d He added, \u201cIt is likely that Bayes\u2019 theorem would adjust faster than people would tend to do using quick-mode thinking\u201d \u2014 because people can get locked into their quick conclusions, while Bayes slowly and steadily tacks. \n \n Arnold I. Barnett, a statistician at the MIT Sloan School of Management, worries that people who use the tools without fully understanding them may be led astray, \u201cthat the very act of quantifying a probability obscures the point that the numerical estimate is itself subject to uncertainty,\u201d he said. \u201cThus the estimate might be taken more literally than is warranted.\u201d \n \n Despite the widespread use of Bayesian methods in searches, not every airline or government uses them \u2014 there\u2019s no evidence the Malaysian government nor Malaysia Airlines has in the current search, though they are getting help from a team of French government investigators who worked on the Air France hunt. (The Malaysian embassy in Washington, D.C., didn\u2019t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment, and calls to the embassy on Monday yielded an automated reply that the office was closed because of snow.) \n \n \u201cI suspect that they just guess, like professional baseball managers used to do before \u2018Moneyball,\u2019\u201d said Peter Thall, a biostatistician at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. \n \n CORRECTION (March 18, 11:30 a.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Metron joined the search for Air France Flight 447 two years after the crash. Metron joined earlier; a search based on its Bayesian calculations that found the wreck began two years after the crash. \n \n CLARIFICATION: An earlier version of this article garbled an example of Bayesian inference about choosing a restaurant. The example should have said that meals were good at half of restaurants with ratings below four and a half stars, not that half of lousy meals have been good. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Members of the Brazilian Frigate Constituicao recovering debris in June 2009 \n \n Statisticians helped locate an Air France plane in 2011 which was missing for two years. Could mathematical techniques inspired by an 18th Century Presbyterian minister be used to locate the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370? \n \n In June 2009, Air France flight 447 went missing flying from Rio de Janeiro in Brazil to Paris, France. \n \n Debris from the Airbus A330 was found floating on the surface of the Atlantic five days later, but the mystery of why the plane crashed could only be answered by finding the black box and the cockpit voice recorder. \n \n You may think that having found the debris it would be easy to find the rest of the plane, but it's not that simple - after a number of days, the material would have moved with the ocean current. \n \n Software does exist that can simulate how the debris has travelled from the initial impact. It is used regularly by the US Coast Guard. \n \n But in this case, because this area near the equator is known for unpredictable currents - particularly at that time of year - it was no help. \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Debris from the Air France crash is laid out for investigation in 2009 \n \n American, Brazilian and French ships, planes and submarines all searched for the plane, but they couldn't find it. \n \n At this point France's aviation accident investigation authority, BEA, made a call to a group of statisticians in the US who had expertise in finding objects lost at sea. \n \n Senior analyst Colleen Keller flew to France to help. \n \n More or Less: Behind the stats Listen to More or Less on BBC Radio 4 and the World Service, or download the free podcast Download the More or Less podcast More stories from More or Less \n \n \"The French BEA had already done a wonderful job of coming up with different theories for why the aircraft might have crashed,\" she says. \n \n They also had lots of data about historical crashes and the results of the searches that had already been carried out. \n \n To turn all this information into numbers and probability, Keller and her team from Metron Inc in Virginia, relied on Bayesian statistics named after a British Presbyterian minister called Thomas Bayes. \n \n This type of thinking allows you to assess various scenarios at once - even contradictory ones. The probability of each being true is brought together to give you the most likely solution. And if you find new information, you can revise your model easily. \n \n Keller and her colleagues went through all the available information and assessed the uncertainties of each piece of data - applying Bayesian principles of probability to work out the most likely location of the plane. \n \n The team split up the search area into a grid, and applied to each cell a figure representing the probability that the plane would be found there. \n \n Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption A Brazilian Air Force radar plane prepares to leave Fernando de Noronha airport to search for Flight 447 \n \n To calculate these figures, they first looked at the theories about what caused the plane to crash. For instance, they assessed the likeliness of various mechanical failures, and came up with a probability for each scenario. \n \n They then assessed historical data from previous crashes, noting, for example, that planes were usually found very close to where they were last known to have been. \n \n Finally, Keller and her team lowered the probability of the plane being found in locations that had already been searched. \n \n \"There are two components to Bayesian maths which make it unique. It allows you to consider all the data you have including the uncertainties which is very important because nothing is certain,\" says Keller. \n \n \"And to combine it all - it even allows you to combine views that contradict each other. \n \n \"For instance with the Malaysian search, you have that arc to the north and the arc to the south. It's either one or the other but it can't have gone both ways, but [Bayes] allows you to preserve all your theories and weight them.\" \n \n The second benefit is that the Bayesian approach is very flexible, Keller says.

But those hopes were dashed. There was no sign of the plane. \n \n It seemed the statisticians could not help after all. \n \n Some months later, though, Air France got back in touch and asked Keller to make one last attempt to analyse the data. \n \n This time, she and her colleagues decided they were not happy with one of their initial assumptions. \n \n The historical data showed that after a crash, the black box will be emitting a signal in 90% of cases. \n \n In the immediate aftermath of the crash, search teams had spent a lot of time sweeping the areas close to the last known location, listening for the ping of the black box or voice recorder. \n \n They had heard nothing.

That's how Air France flight 447 was found in 2009, using \"Bayesian statistics\" to measure the probability of the plane being in one place or another. Named after Presbyterian minister and mathematician Thomas Bayes, the technique allowed experts to apply several factors to each point on a map: For example, what was the chance it crashed from mechanical failure? How far do planes tend to crash from their last known location? What was the chance that search teams missed debris in various locations? It's like picking a restaurant by balancing how full it is, what your favorite restaurant-review website says, and so on\u2014except that experts hunting for Airbus A330 did that for each point where plane may have crashed in the Atlantic, Five Thirty-Eight notes. It was so hard that the US team of statisticians invited by France gave up, until they de-emphasized one statistic: that a plane's black box emits a signal after a crash 90% of the time. They changed their findings, and presto, the plane was found. Bayesian techniques have helped people find World War II U-boats, men overboard, and sunken treasure, but there's no evidence that Malaysia is employing them now. \"I suspect that they just guess, like professional baseball managers used to do before Moneyball,\" says a biostatistician.",

How likely is this cough to be a cold? Our first estimate of these probabilities may be no better than an educated guess.\" In the case of Flight 370, Bayesian inference can be used to update the probability of finding the plane at any point in the search area. \"Without good records, it will be very difficult for us to reconstruct and credit the current search effort,\" says the lead scientist on the Air France search.",

The cockroach also had a narrow body and wings, elongated legs and mouthparts, and an extra set of modified eyes located on the top of its head, which likely helped it spot predators, such as the feathered dinosaurs living at the time. \n \n This little monster was a solitary hunter \n \n The cockroach was found preserved in amber by German researcher Ziggi Ellenberger in modern day Myanmar. \n \n At first, scientists thought the cockroach might have been a mantis. \n \n But an examination by Dr Peter Vr\u0161ansk\u00fd, from the Geological Institute of Bratislava and the Slovak Academy of Sciences revealed it to be something different. \u201cAfter the first look I knew it was something new,\u201d he told BBC Earth. \u201cNothing similar runs on Earth today.\u201d \n \n Vr\u0161ansk\u00fd made the discovery, reported in the journal Geologica Carpathica along with G\u00fcnter Bechly, from the State Museum of Natural History in Stuttgart, Germany. \n \n They believe the cockroach hunted at night. \n \n \u201cThis little monster was a solitary hunter, able to run very fast, with a body unlike the vast majority of cockroaches living today, it posed high above ground, frequently taking flight when necessary, and seizing its prey with strong short spines developed on its extremely long feet,\u201d he adds. \n \n Not all scientists agree on the cockroach\u2019s hunting skills though. Manipulator had long and weak legs, and was unlikely to run fast, says Dr Alexandr Rasnitsyn, a professor from the Palaeontological Institute, at the Russian Academy of Sciences. \n \n He thinks it was more likely to surprise rather than chase its prey, using its long limbs to traverse gaps between forest leaves. \n \n The new discovery in among a number of ancient cockroaches found in Myanmar. \n \n Many were predatory insects that evolved to rule the night. \u201cEspecially drastic and brutal were top predatory Raphidiomimidae.

It lived about 480 million years ago in a shallow sea that once covered part of the Sahara Desert. \n \n \"It is one of the biggest arthropods that ever existed, far bigger than any arthropod today,\" said Peter Van Roy, a paleobiologist at Yale University who helped uncover some of specimens of the extinct animal. \n \n A paper describing this strange early arthropod was published Wednesday in the journal Nature. \n \n Aegirocassis benmoulae is part of an extinct group of animals known as anomalocaridid, which were already known to be the largest animals of the Cambrian time period 543 million to 490 million years ago. Aegirocassis is the most recent of these animals to be found and more than double the size of the biggest of its older known relatives. \n \n It lived during the Great Ordovician Biodiversification Event, about 10 million years after the Cambrian period came to a close. \n \n All of the anamolocardids were flat-bodied water dwellers, and all of them had two appendages in the front of their mouths. These structures were mostly used to grasp prey like worms and mollusks. However, Aegirocassis modified these appendages, creating an elaborate netlike structure of spikes that allowed it to catch the rapidly diversifying plankton found in the water column at the time. \n \n Despite its large size, Aegirocassis appears to have been fairly common, Van Roy said. He and the Moroccan fossil collector Mohamed Ben Moula, who first discovered these large animals, have found dozens of preserved specimens in the Moroccan desert. \n \n \"They may have come together to molt, or they may have lived in a group,\" he said. \"It is interesting we found so many of them. It shows there was a well developed, rich plankton system in place 480 million years ago.\" \n \n Arthropods first showed up in the fossil record about 530 million years ago, and today the phylum consists of the most morphologically diverse group of animals on the planet. \n \n However, early fossils of arthropods are hard to come by, which made this particular find so exciting. \n \n Most fossils are the remains of the hard parts of organisms, like shells and bone, because soft tissues decay so rapidly after death, explained John Paterson, an associate professor at the University of New England in Armidale, Australia, who was not involved in the study. \n \n \"However, these extraordinary fossils are soft-bodied, which are typically very rare,\" he said. \"They require rapid burial and low oxygen conditions in order to be preserved in such exquisite detail.\" \n \n According to Van Roy, giant storms occasionally caused large mud flows to wash into the ancient sea, smothering everything at the bottom and making it inaccessible for scavengers. \n \n \"If you have the right sediments and they react with the right decay products, then you can basically turn soft tissues to stone,\" he said. \"But a very specific set of criteria must be met, so sites like this are extremely rare.\" \n \n The fossils were so well preserved that they allowed researchers to see a previously hidden feature on the body of these early arthropods, helping them to solve a longstanding evolutionary mystery. \n \n The success of arthropods is associated with the way they are constructed. Their bodies and legs are made of multiple segments that can be be modified for a variety of purposes, allowing them to adapt to a wide range of environments. \n \n \"Morphologically, they are incredibly plastic,\" Van Roy said. \n \n Today, the legs of most arthropods have two branches, but researchers were not sure how these double-branched limbs had evolved over time. \n \n Paleontologists thought they could trace the origins of this double-branched limb to an arthropod ancestor from the early Cambrian. This ancient animal had a set of flaps that ran down the top side of its body for swimming, representing an upper limb, and a set of legs on its belly side, for walking. \n \n And yet, previous studies of anamolocardids, a later arthropod, had found just one set of flaps on the lower side of the body. This led researchers to wonder where the upper limb had gone. \n \n The new fossils described in the Nature paper suggest that the second limb did not go anywhere. They show that anamolocardids did have a second set of swimming flaps on the back side of their segments, but they have only been preserved in these particularly complete fossils. \n \n \"These flaps represent the precursors of more modern-style (two-branched) limbs that we see in other arthropods,\" Paterson said via email. \n \n Van Roy said there were still many more fossils to go through from the Moroccan site. \n \n \"We have something like 5,000 or 6,000 specimens, most of them unstudied,\" he said. \n \n Among the other animals they found are more advanced arthropods, a variety of horseshoe crabs, some which look remarkably like modern-day horseshoe crabs, jellyfish relatives, and early starfish and snails. \n \n \"There are a lot of really exciting things coming,\" he said. \n \n Science rules!

Edwards was killed leaving an unruly house party Saturday night when former police officer Roy Oliver opened fired on the car Edwards was a passenger in. Oliver was fired Tuesday for... (Associated Press) \n \n DALLAS (AP) \u2014 A white Texas police officer faces a murder charge in the shooting of a black teenager after being fired earlier in the week, authorities said. \n \n Roy Oliver turned himself in Friday night, just hours after the Dallas County Sheriff's Office issued a warrant for his arrest in the April 29 death of 15-year-old Jordan Edwards. Oliver, a former officer in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs, was later released after posting bail at the Parker County Jail in Weatherford, about 95 miles west of Dallas. His bond had been set at $300,000. \n \n The sheriff's office said in a statement the warrant was issued based on evidence that suggested Oliver \"intended to cause serious bodily injury and commit an act clearly dangerous to human life that caused the death.\" \n \n Oliver fired a rifle at a car full of teenagers leaving a party, fatally shooting Edwards who was a passenger in the vehicle. The teen's death led to protests calling for Oliver to be fired and charged. On Tuesday, the same day that the officer was fired, news broke of the Justice Department's decision not to charge two white police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in the shooting death of a black man in 2016. And a white officer in North Charleston, South Carolina, pleaded guilty that day to federal civil rights charges in the fatal shooting of a black man in 2015. \n \n Edwards and his two brothers and two other teenagers were leaving an unruly house party in Balch Springs when Oliver opened fire on their car with a rifle. The bullets shattered the front passenger-side window and struck Edwards. It took a few moments for Edwards' 16-year-old brother, who was driving, and other passengers to notice that he was slumped over in his seat. \n \n Police had said the teenagers' car was backing up toward officers \"in an aggressive manner,\" but later said body camera video showed the vehicle actually driving away from the officers. \n \n The investigation into the shooting \"will continue and does not conclude with the arrest,\" sheriff's spokeswoman Melinda Urbina said. \n \n Attorneys for Oliver and the family of Edwards didn't respond to requests for comment. \n \n Oliver's firing Tuesday was for violating department policies in the shooting. \n \n Records show that Oliver was briefly suspended in 2013 following a complaint about his conduct while serving as a witness in a drunken-driving case. \n \n Personnel records from the Balch Springs Police Department obtained by The Associated Press show Oliver was suspended for 16 hours in December 2013 after the Dallas County District Attorney's Office filed the complaint. Oliver also was ordered to take training courses in anger management and courtroom demeanor and testimony. \n \n The personnel records also included periodic evaluations that noted at least one instance when Oliver was reprimanded for being \"disrespectful to a civilian on a call.\" That evaluation, dated Jan. 27, 2017, called the reprimand an isolated incident and urged Oliver to be mindful of his leadership role in the department. \n \n The complaint from the prosecutor's office said the office had a hard time getting Oliver to attend the trial, he was angry he had to be there, he used vulgar language that caused an assistant district attorney to send a female intern out of the room, and he used profanity during his testimony. \n \n \"In an email from one of the prosecutors he states you were a 'scary person to have in our workroom,'\" then-Balch Springs Police Chief Ed Morris wrote in the suspension findings. \n \n Oliver joined the Balch Springs department in 2011 after being an officer with the Dalworthington Gardens Police Department for almost a year. A statement from Dalworthington Gardens officials on Wednesday included details of that and previous intermittent employment as a dispatcher and public works employee between 1999 and 2004. \n \n He received an award for \"meritorious conduct\" as a dispatcher and there were no documented complaints or disciplinary action in either his work as a public safety officer or dispatcher, according to the statement. Between his employment as a dispatcher and officer in the Dallas suburb, Oliver was in the U.S. Army, rising to the rank of sergeant while serving two tours in Iraq and earning various commendations. He served for two years in the Texas National Guard reserves through 2012. \n \n After the Dallas County Attorney's Office complained about Oliver's behavior, Morris suspended the officer for 16 hours, which Oliver completed by forfeiting two sick days. \n \n ___ \n \n Weissert reported from Austin. Associated Press writers Terry Wallace, Paul J. Weber in Austin and Juan A. Lozano in Houston contributed to this report. ||||| Police originally said Oliver fired on the car because it was backing up aggressively toward the officers. But the department revised its account after reviewing body-cam footage, saying the car was driving away when Jordan was shot. \n \n The arrest warrant affidavit, obtained Friday by The Dallas Morning News, says another officer used his gun to break the car's rear window before Oliver got behind the officer and fired several rounds into the car as it drove past. \n \n The white officer's shooting of an unarmed black teenager has renewed allegations nationwide that racial bias among police has led to deadly overreactions. \n \n An attorney for Jordan's family, Lee Merritt, said Friday that Jordan's parents were \"grateful\" investigators sought a murder charge. The news came as they prepared to bury Jordan on Saturday. \n \n Merritt said it was clear from the start that Oliver should be arrested on the highest possible charge. \n \n \"I think it begins to at least give the appearance that the state is not going to sweep this clear wrong under the rug as it's done in the past,\" Merritt said. \"However we also have to learn from history that we don't have a conviction yet. And so we still have some ways to go.\" ||||| A fired Balch Springs police officer faces a murder charge in the fatal shooting of 15-year-old Jordan Edwards, the Dallas County Sheriff's Office says.

We have a certain set of values, and it did not meet our values,\" Haber added. \n \n Oliver was later fired from the police department. \n \n Investigators say evidence suggests Oliver \"intended to cause serious bodily injury and commit an act clearly dangerous to human life that caused the death of an individual,\" according to the warrant. \n \n \"If there's something to learn, let's learn it, but let's not learn it as individuals,\" Haber said. \"Let's learn as a group and push that message out together.\" \n \n The Dallas County Sheriff's Office said Friday that its investigation into Edwards' death will continue.",

Roy Oliver turned himself in Friday night, just hours after the Dallas County Sheriff's Office issued a warrant for his arrest in the April 29 death of 15-year-old Jordan Edwards, the AP reports. Oliver, a former officer in the Dallas suburb of Balch Springs, was later released after posting bail at the Parker County Jail in Weatherford, about 95 miles west of Dallas. The sheriff's office said in a statement the warrant was issued based on evidence that suggested Oliver \"intended to cause serious bodily injury and commit an act clearly dangerous to human life that caused the death.\" Oliver fired a rifle at a car full of teenagers leaving a party, fatally shooting Edwards, who was a passenger in the vehicle. The teen's death led to protests calling for Oliver to be fired and charged. On Tuesday, the same day that the officer was fired, news broke of the Justice Department's decision not to charge two white police officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, in the shooting death of a black man in 2016. And a white officer in North Charleston, South Carolina, pleaded guilty that day to federal civil rights charges in the fatal shooting of a black man in 2015. Edwards and his two brothers and two other teenagers were leaving an unruly house party in Balch Springs when Oliver opened fire on their car with a rifle. The bullets shattered the front passenger-side window and struck Edwards. It took a few moments for his 16-year-old brother, who was driving, to notice that he was slumped over in his seat. Police initially said the car was backing up toward officers, but body camera footage showed the car was actually backing away.",

    "document": "Consider the condescension implicit in the president\u2019s statement\u2014\u201ca term that most people outside of Washington have probably never heard of before.\u201d These \u201cpeople outside of Washington\u201d are not little children being lectured on an obscure subject by a worldly adult. These people outside Washington are ... citizens. Judging by the polls, most of us have opinions about whether, and under what conditions, the debt ceiling should be raised. We don\u2019t seem to be as ignorant as Obama thinks we are of the term or concept of a debt ceiling. But the president assumes we\u2019ve never bothered our pretty little heads about such a thing. \n \n Understand \u2013 raising the debt ceiling does not allow Congress to spend more money. It simply gives our country the ability to pay the bills that Congress has already racked up. \n \n Now, what makes today\u2019s stalemate so dangerous is that it has been tied to something known as the debt ceiling \u2013 a term that most people outside of Washington have probably never heard of before. \n \n And he doesn\u2019t want us to start bothering our pretty little heads about it now. So Obama instructs us as to what the debt ceiling is. He claims that \u201craising the debt ceiling does not allow Congress to spend more money.\u201d That statement might be true about a rise in the debt ceiling that would take us only through the rest of the current fiscal year, for which funds have already been appropriated by Congress. It is simply not true about the increase Obama is asking for, which is designed to cover the next fiscal year and a bit more. The fact is, Obama\u2019s $2.4 trillion increase (a number that never appears in the speech) does precisely what Obama says it doesn\u2019t: it \u201callow[s] Congress to spend more money.\u201d It is not the case that Obama\u2019s debt ceiling hike \u201csimply gives our country the ability to pay the bills that Congress has already racked up.\u201d \n \n It would be nice to have a president who spoke candidly to his fellow citizens as adults. ||||| C-SPAN screen shot \n \n I intended to write about President Obama's prime-time address on the debt ceiling, but House Speaker John Boehner's performance turned out to be the big news. Last seen Friday evening complaining that the president added new last-minute conditions in their debt-ceiling negotiations, Boehner now seems to have no memory of those negotiations, which by both parties' account left them about $400 billion apart. That's not chump change, but against the backdrop of an attempted $4 trillion deal, it didn't have to be a deal-breaker either. \n \n But if you listened to Boehner Monday night, you'd think he and Obama never discussed a deal. In fact you'd believe the president never wanted any kind of deficit-reduction deal at all. In an impressive display of mendacity, Boehner told the American people the president wants \"a blank check\" to keep on spending, and the House GOP is serving \"the American people\" by resisting. Instead of talking about how he and Obama might close the gap they faced only three days ago, Boehner went full-tilt Tea Party crazy and presented his own plan, which requires not only brutal spending cuts but a balanced budget amendment -- as well as another congressional vote to hike the debt ceiling again at the height of the 2012 election season. \n \n Can there be any doubt that the Republicans' only interest here is making Obama fail? Let's review all the ways they moved the goalposts since the 2010 elections gave them new power. In December Boehner told the New Yorker that raising the debt ceiling would be the new House majority\u2019s \"first really big adult moment,\" adding, \"We\u2019ll have to find a way to help educate members and help people understand the serious problem that would exist if we didn\u2019t do it.\" For his part Obama said he expected a clean up or down vote, just like President Reagan got 18 times and George W. Bush got another seven times. But after Boehner negotiated his program-cuts-for-continuing-government deal, in April he began to make threats. \"The president says I want you to send me a clean bill. Well guess what, Mr. President: Not a chance you\u2019re going to get a clean bill,\" he told a GOP fundraiser. \"There will not be an increase in the debt limit without something really, really big attached to it.\" \n \n Obama decided to negotiate, but he demanded a dollar of tax or revenue hikes for every dollar of spending cuts. Republicans not only rejected revenue hikes, they demanded a dollar of spending cuts for every dollar the debt ceiling was raised. Obama began seeking a \"grand bargain,\" in which he'd discuss Social Security and Medicare cuts (even though Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit) in exchange for at least revenue hikes. The earliest leaks about such a deal, believe them or not, all contained spending cuts three to five times bigger than revenue hikes. Then what happened? Boehner walked away from negotiations to close those deals -- which would have infuriated many progressives, by the way, including me. And a few weeks ago, as the president got ever more conciliating, Republicans got more stubborn, now demanding a balanced budget amendment in whatever deal is reached. \n \n I honestly don't think anyone has come out and said how extraordinarily apocalyptic and insane it is to tie that controversial old GOP issue to the debt ceiling hike, given the disaster for the American economy if we default. The balanced budget amendment lost favor under the deficit-building Ronald Reagan, when many Republicans decided deficits weren't really an issue -- unless a Democrat held the White House. Tonight Boehner was on prime-time national television telling Americans that's what it will take to increase the debt ceiling. Now, Boehner knows a balanced budget amendment bill can't pass. Hell, he probably doesn't even want it. But this is the way the GOP ups the ante every time the president gets close to a deal. \n \n And what did the president do? He tried to explain how we got into this mess, and he prepared us for a gut-wrenching, economy-wounding compromise. I liked a lot of Obama's speech tonight, but he made a couple of points that typify the way he ultimately negotiates against himself. He opened with that sad and useless comparison between the federal budget and household budgets. Paul Krugman and Robert Reich, among others, have explained why it's wrong until they're blue in the face -- unlike each of our little families, the federal government correctly goes into deficit spending to spur recovery from recession; in fact, the government does it because our families can't or shouldn't. Obama still found the folksy comparison irresistible. \"Every family knows a little credit card debt is manageable,\" the president said, while arguing that anything more than \"a little\" hurts the economy. \n \n His rhetorical climax also left me a little cold. Talking about Americans' many frustrations with the status quo, Obama concluded: \"But do you know what people are fed up with most of all? They\u2019re fed up with a town where compromise has become a dirty word.\" Does he really think that? Obama continued: \n \n They work all day long, many of them scraping by, just to put food on the table. And when these Americans come home at night, bone-tired, and turn on the news, all they see is the same partisan three-ring circus here in Washington. They see leaders who can\u2019t seem to come together and do what it takes to make life just a little bit better for ordinary Americans. They are offended by that. And they should be. \n \n You know, I'm sure that's true for some people who are \"scraping by.\" But I think it's mainly true for the Beltway elites the president hears from way too much. That's the complaint of David Brooks and Tom Friedman, and the hedge-funders backing the frivolous \"third party\" time-waster, Americans Elect. It's not what the unemployed and the struggling and people afraid they'll lose Social Security or Medicare benefits are \"fed up with most of all.\" Obama can't really think that, can he? \n \n In this political environment, anything is possible. Prepare to hear that Harry Reid's deal to cut $2.7 trillion from the budget, with absolutely no revenue increases, is a victory for Democrats. It won't be. I hope I'm wrong, but the president is dealing with a conscience-free opposition willing to risk economic tragedy to defeat him. I'd love to see all of his maneuvering result in a clean up or down vote on a debt increase (which some of his most avid supporters insist is his goal). I don't see it from here. Again, I would be thrilled to be wrong. ||||| President Barack Obama elbowed his way back into the debt ceiling debate Monday night, three days after Republicans shoved him out, but he offered no hint of a solution to the escalating political and financial crisis. \n \n If regular citizens \u2014 or markets here and overseas \u2014 were looking for reassurance in Obama\u2019s 15-minute speech or House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s five-minute rebuttal, they were out of luck. Instead, the men who hold the fiscal destiny of nearly 312 million people in their hands treated viewers to the unsettling spectacle of two leaders talking past, not to, each other. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset 'Let's seize this moment' 'President wants a blank check today' POLITICO 44 \n \n With neither Obama nor House Republicans yet willing to make the final compromise necessary to seal a deal, the leader of the free world made a stunning appeal for regular citizens to call or email their representatives to end what he called the \u201cmost dangerous game.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis is no way to run the greatest country on Earth. \u2026 We can\u2019t allow the American people to become collateral damage to Washington\u2019s political warfare,\u201d Obama added. \u201cIf you want a balanced approach to reducing the deficit, let your member of Congress know.\u201d \n \n The tactic seemed to have the desired effect, temporarily overwhelming the website of Boehner (R-Ohio) and other GOP leaders. \n \n Obama did call for unity, quoting Ronald Reagan and citing former presidents from both parties who support a \u201cbalanced approach\u201d of spending cuts, revenue increases and entitlement reforms. But he also bashed Republicans, arguing that their tactics \u201crisk sparking a deep economic crisis \u2014 one caused almost entirely by Washington\u201d and categorically rejected Boehner\u2019s new plan for a short-term debt ceiling hike. \n \n \u201cDefaulting on our obligations is a reckless and irresponsible outcome to this debate,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd Republican leaders say that they agree we must avoid default. But the new approach that Speaker Boehner unveiled today, which would temporarily extend the debt ceiling in exchange for spending cuts, would force us to once again face the threat of default just six months from now. In other words, it doesn\u2019t solve the problem.\u201d \n \n Beyond the I\u2019m-still-here theme of the speech, Obama sought to strike the larger themes of his 2012 campaign, aimed at independent voters who have only now begun tuning into the debt debate: the need for compromise, his disgust with partisan Washington and his determination to make the rich pay their fair share. If his campaign-style rhetoric was persuasive, it came at an awkward time, during the final days when a reasonable debt ceiling compromise can still be struck. ||||| \n \n President Obama made clear tonight that the debate over the debt ceiling is not left vs. right. It\u2019s center vs. right. There was nothing remotely \u201cleft\u201d in this speech, unless you count higher taxes for corporate jet owners and a few other populist bits. \n \n He summarized his approach this way: \u201c[L]et\u2019s live within our means by making serious, historic cuts in government spending. Let\u2019s cut domestic spending to the lowest level it\u2019s been since Dwight Eisenhower was president. Let\u2019s cut defense spending at the Pentagon by hundreds of billions of dollars. Let\u2019s cut out the waste and fraud in health care programs like Medicare \u2014 and at the same time, let\u2019s make modest adjustments so that Medicare is still there for future generations. Finally, let\u2019s ask the wealthiest Americans and biggest corporations to give up some of their tax breaks and special deductions.\u201d \n \n That\u2019s four sentences on cuts and barely one sentence on taxes, and not even tax increases as such \u2014 just a request that the privileged \u201cgive up some of their tax breaks and special deductions.\u201d \n \n On the other side are \u201ca significant number of Republicans in Congress [who] are insisting on a cuts-only approach \u2014 an approach that doesn\u2019t ask the wealthiest Americans or biggest corporations to contribute anything at all.\u201d He went on: \u201cAnd because nothing is asked of those at the top of the income scales, such an approach would close the deficit only with more severe cuts to programs we all care about \u2014 cuts that place a greater burden on working families.\u201d \n \n That happens to be true. The most remarkable thing about this whole debate (other than the dangerous foolishness of one side holding the nation\u2019s credit standing hostage to get what it wants) is that Republicans have defined their party as being committed to low taxes for the wealthy above everything else. If anything good can come out of this strange episode, it is that no one will ever be able to doubt that proposition in the future. \n \n There were some nice touches in Obama\u2019s address. Who would ever have imagined that it was Ronald Reagan who said: \u201cWould you rather reduce deficits and interest rates by raising revenue from those who are not now paying their fair share, or would you rather accept larger budget deficits, higher interest rates, and higher unemployment? And I think I know your answer.\u201d \n \n It was also good that right out of the box, Obama reminded Americans where the big deficits came from \u2013 and where we were when President George W. Bush took office: \u201cIn the year 2000, the government had a budget surplus,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut instead of using it to pay off our debt, the money was spent on trillions of dollars in new tax cuts, while two wars and an expensive prescription-drug program were simply added to our nation\u2019s credit card. As a result, the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office.\u201d He then explained that the deficit grew further because of the Great Recession, the drop in tax receipts it caused, and the spending he undertook to keep it from being worse. It was a direct hit at Republicans who seemed not to worry about deficits until Obama took office \u2014 and now blame him for much of the red ink they themselves spilled. \n \n And after his angry news conference on Friday, it was a nice touch for him to wrap his arms around his main Republican adversary. \u201cAnd to his credit, this is the kind of approach\u201d \u2013 that would be the one Obama was advancing \u2013 \u201cthe Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner, was working on with me over the last several weeks.\u201d It did raise the question of which side Boehner is really on. \n \n As for Boehner\u2019s speech, he looked pretty good \u2014 that green tie was striking \u2014 but his speech was directed more to the right-wing base than to the crisis at hand. \u201cThe sad truth is that the president wanted a blank check six months ago, and he wants a blank check today,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cThat is just not going to happen.\u201d Please. As Obama pointed out, he just wanted what Reagan got 18 times and George W. Bush got seven times \u2014 a normal debt-ceiling increase. And I wish the GOP would stop talking about its \u201cCut, Cap and Balance\u201d bill as \u201cbipartisan.\u201d It got 240 votes, of which only five were from Democrats. It was opposed by 190 House members, of whom nine were Republicans. So opposition to their bill was more \u201cbipartisan\u201d than the support it got. \n \n On the issue we now confront, the Senate proposal to raise the debt ceiling is much more sensible than the House plan because it insists that we not go through this charade again until Americans get their say at the ballot box a year from November. The most persuasive argument in Obama\u2019s speech may thus have been this one: \u201cBased on what we\u2019ve seen these past few weeks, we know what to expect six months from now. The House will once again refuse to prevent default unless the rest of us accept their cuts-only approach. . . . And once again, the economy will be held captive unless they get their way.\u201d \n \n This whole mess is not making any politician in Washington look good. Obama has taken a modest hit in his approval ratings, but the Republicans are taking a bigger hit. My hunch is that Obama\u2019s speech spoke more to middle-of-the-road Americans than Boehner\u2019s did because Obama was clearly talking to them. Boehner has to prove over and over that he\u2019s faithful to the folks at the right end of his caucus, and it\u2019s starting to take a toll. That\u2019s why Republicans may yet find themselves wanting to get the debt-ceiling matter out of the way without forcing another round of this madness.",

Obama\u2019s speech proved this isn\u2019t a left vs. right debate. \u201cIt\u2019s center vs. right,\u201d argues EJ Dionne of the Washington Post. \u201cThere was nothing remotely \u2018left\u2019 in this speech.\u201d With some deft rhetorical touches\u2014like quoting Ronald Reagan\u2014 \u201cmy hunch is that Obama\u2019s speech spoke more to middle-of-the-road Americans.\u201d But William Kristol of the Weekly Standard thought Obama came across as condescending\u2014especially when he said most Americans had probably never heard of the debt ceiling. \u201cIt would be nice to have a president who spoke candidly to his fellow citizens as adults,\u201d he writes. Boehner, meanwhile, went \u201cfull-tilt Tea Party crazy,\u201d writes Joan Walsh of Salon. He acted as though he and Obama had never discussed a deal at all, while demanding a balanced budget amendment\u2014which is \u201cextraordinarily apocalyptic and insane,\u201d because Boehner knows that can\u2019t pass. \u201cHell, he probably doesn\u2019t even want it.\u201d He\u2019s just moving the goal posts on Obama again.",

(0:54) \n \n A 22-year-old man has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of Iowa State golfer Celia Barquin Arozamena, the 2018 Big 12 champion and the school's female athlete of the year. \n \n Barquin Arozamena, 22, was found dead Monday at a golf course in Ames, Iowa. Ames police on Monday night announced that Collin Daniel Richards has been charged following an investigation by several law enforcement agencies. Richards made his initial appearance at the Story County Courthouse in Nevada, Iowa, at 9 a.m. Tuesday; bond was set at $5 million during a brief hearing. \n \n Officers were called to Coldwater Golf Course on Monday morning after golfers had located a golf bag with no one around it. Officers located Barquin Arozamena's body in a pond near the ninth hole of the course and determined she had been assaulted. Barquin Arozamena suffered \"several stab wounds to the upper torso, head and neck,\" Ames police said in a criminal complaint. \n \n At the appearance, Story County Attorney Jessica Reynolds said the crime is believed to be \"a random act of violence.\" \n \n During a news conference Tuesday, Ames Police public information officer Geoff Huff said there are no other suspects at this time, but the investigation is ongoing. \n \n Huff said Richards has no known address but appeared to be staying in a tent in a wooded area adjacent to the golf course. A police dog tracked Barquin Arozamena's scent to the temporary camp. \n \n An acquaintance of Richards told investigators the suspect had said in recent days that he had \"an urge to rape and kill a woman\" while they were walking on a trail near the course, the complaint said. A second acquaintance told police that Richards arrived at his home on Monday appearing \"disheveled and covered in blood, sand and water.\" He bathed and left with his clothes in a backpack. \n \n Investigators later recovered two pairs of shorts with blood stains and a knife that Richards allegedly gave to two other people after the slaying, the complaint said. Those two individuals were driving Richards out of town after the slaying, but he asked them to drop him off near the camp so he could get his tent, and that's when officers arrested him, the complaint said. Officers found Richards with several fresh scratches on his face consistent with fighting, and a deep laceration in his left hand that he tried to conceal, according to the complaint. \n \n John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports \n \n A native of Spain, Barquin Arozamena won the Big 12 championship by 3 strokes in April. She was a three-time all-conference selection, earned first-team All-Big 12 academic honors three times and qualified for NCAA regionals in all four years she competed. She became the third Cyclones women's golfer to compete in the U.S. Women's Open Championship, the university said. \n \n \"We are all devastated,\" Iowa State women's golf coach Christie Martens said in a prepared statement. \"Celia was a beautiful person who was loved by all her teammates and friends. She loved Iowa State and was an outstanding representative for our school. We will never forget her competitive drive to be the best and her passion for life.\" \n \n Iowa State athletic director Jamie Pollard said Barquin had \"broke down in tears\" when she found out she had been named the school's 2018 female athlete of the year -- an achievement she had been set to be honored for during Saturday's football game. Instead, the team will wear helmet decals with Barquin's initials to honor her. \n \n Professional golfer Sergio Garcia tweeted about the death of the fellow Spaniard. \n \n Heartbroken over what happened to #CeliaBarquinArozamena I had the pleasure of meeting her and I know she was a special person. Sending my thoughts and prayers to her family and loved ones in this difficult time \u2014 Sergio Garcia (@TheSergioGarcia) September 18, 2018 \n \n Richards was known to the police department. He had completed a seven-month prison sentence in June. \n \n \"We have had encounters with him in the past,\" Huff said. \n \n Jefferson (Iowa) Police Chief Mark Clouse told ESPN that a few years ago, Richards had been staying at his grandparents' home in Jefferson, working on remodeling the residence. Clouse said his officers were called to the address at least three times for reports of domestic disputes involving Richards and his girlfriend or his grandfather. \n \n One of those calls, in May 2015, resulted in an arrest on charges of domestic abuse, to which Richards pleaded guilty. According to the police report, Richards, who was 18 at the time, told police that he and his girlfriend had been cooking supper when the woman started acting \"weird\" and he asked her to leave. They began arguing and Richards started to gather her belongings and take them outside, the report stated. He told police that when she tried to stop him and yelled at him, he put her \"in a 'secured headlock' and drug her outside.\" \n \n She told police that Richards cut off her airway. The officer observed scrapes and cuts on the woman's left arm and a finger, and redness around her neck and chest. \n \n \"They'd get involved in arguments, and we'd get called to go there,\" Clouse said. \n \n However, he said his officers' interactions with Richards were \"nothing that stood out as someone capable of what happened,\" regarding the charges he is facing now. Clouse said Richards also had several run-ins with other local law enforcement agencies relating to probation violations, drug possession and theft. \n \n Richards, who faces life in prison if convicted, reported in a financial affidavit that he has no job. Paul Rounds, a public defender assigned to represent him, filed paperwork asserting that his client didn't wish to speak to investigators. \n \n Barquin Arozamena finished her golf eligibility this spring but remained in school to complete her civil engineering degree in the fall semester. \n \n \"This is a tragic and senseless loss of a talented young woman and an acclaimed student athlete,\" Iowa State University president Dr. Wendy Wintersteen said in a prepared statement. \"We mourn with her family and friends in Spain, her teammates here and all who knew her. On behalf of the entire Cyclone family, I extend our deep condolences to Celia's family and her many friends and teammates at Iowa State. We are deeply saddened.\" \n \n Barquin Arozamena's victory at the European Ladies' Amateur Championship had secured her invitations to next year's Women's British Open and the 2018 U.S. Women's Open. \n \n She was also a member of the Spanish national team that finished third and second at the 2015 and 2016 European Amateur Team Championships, respectively. \n \n Nacho Gerv\u00e1s, technical director of the Spanish Golf Federation, told the newspaper El Pa\u00eds: \"She was a player who was heading for the very top, without a doubt.\" \n \n Iowa State withdrew from the final of the East & West Match Play tournament on Tuesday. The golf team had been competing in Ann Arbor, Michigan, but returned to campus. \n \n Funeral arrangements are pending for Barquin Arozamena, who will be honored during Iowa State's home football game Saturday. \n \n ESPN's Paula Lavigne and The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| 2017-18 \n \n Big 12 Champion ...

The 2007 suspension lasted seven. \n \n The 2016 credential suspension was cited as an Education Code 44421 suspension. \n \n Education Code 44421 suspension reads: \n \n \"The Commission on Teacher Credentialing shall privately admonish, publicly reprove, revoke or suspend for immoral or unprofessional conduct, or for persistent defiance of, and refusal to obey, the laws regulating the duties of persons serving in the public school system, or for any cause that would have warranted the denial of an application for a credential or the renewal thereof, or for evident unfitness for service.\" \n \n Commission on Teach Credentialing did not respond to calls before this story went to press. \n \n According to Transparent California, a pay and pension online database, Gieszinger was previously employed by Lindsay Unified School District and Cutler-Orosi Joint Unified School District. \n \n Both school districts did not return calls for comment. \n \n Tulare County Office of Education, which oversees the high school, is also investigating the incident, said Rob Herman, public information officer. \n \n After refusing to comment on the incident Wednesday, TCOE officials released a statement Thursday morning. \n \n \"The staff at University Preparatory High School and the administration at the Tulare County Office of Education are deeply concerned for the students who were subjected to the disturbing behavior in Margaret Gieszinger\u2019s class yesterday morning,\" said Jim Vidak, superintendent of Tulare County schools. \"To support all students on the UPHS campus today, we have sent top counselors from our mental health services program. They will continue to be available to the students as long as necessary.\" \n \n Vidak added that Gieszinger will not return to her UPHS classroom and that a \"highly-qualified substitute teacher\" will take over for the rest of the semester. \n \n UPHS administration will work closely with the substitute teacher until a replacement teacher is hired, Vidak said. \n \n About 225 students are enrolled in the Tulare County Office of Education high school. \n \n University Prep opened on the COS campus in 2009. \n \n More: What prompted a Tulare County student to attack school staff? \n \n More: Valley Children's is one step closer to opening large Visalia clini \n \n Read or Share this story: https://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/news/2018/12/05/visalia-teacher-sings-anthem-chops-students-hair/2218275002/",

Hair flew amid the teacher's loud rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" per the Visalia Times-Delta, which adds Gieszinger stopped the male student as he tried to get away. \"You're not done,\" she allegedly said, and continued cutting. Gieszinger then was said to have grabbed the hair of a female student before kids screamed and ran for the classroom door. Two days earlier, Gieszinger had claimed students were responsible for a test that had gone missing, a parent tells the Times-Delta. \"They asked for help from administrators on Monday but were told they had to go back to class,\" one parent says. One student describes the behavior as out of character for the 52-year-old teacher, later arrested at her home on suspicion of felony child endangerment, per YourCentralValley.com. \"Loving and kind,\" she's \"usually all smiles and laughs.

He used an acronym for the Islamic State. \n \n Most recently, a group calling itself the \u201cIslamic State hacking division,\u201d posted the names and identifying information such as email addresses and phone numbers of some 1,400 former or current military and diplomatic personnel who worked in the United Kingdom, according to London\u2019s Sunday Times.

The Army used the phrase even sooner. In December 2013, U.S. Central Command tweeted the same message, linking to a U.S. Army online story about social media usage titled: \u201cLoose lips still sink ships, loose tweets sink fleets.\u201d \n \n But the Air Force\u2019s twist on the message has been garnering attention from news organizations as diverse as Popular Mechanics and Russia News.Net and has been getting mixed reviews on social media. \n \n \u201c\u2019Loose lips sink ships\u2019 has evolved,\u201d said one commenter on the John Q. Public Facebook site. \u201cProbably more relevant now than in the 1940s.\u201d \n \n Another commenter quipped: \u201cHey Air Force. The Navy called, they want their slogan back.\u201d \n \n svan.jennifer@stripes.com",

Most of the 19 banks passed. \n \n Disclosure of stress-test results in May 2009 boosted confidence in the financial system by giving investors more certainty on the maximum losses firms might sustain, and bank stocks beat the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index in the next 12 months. The KBW Bank Index (BKX) jumped 4.6 percent yesterday after JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. lender, announced it had passed the test and was raising its dividend 20 percent. \n \n The average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for Citigroup to increase its payout to 28 cents this year from 3 cents. They projected the bank would buy back about $2.18 billion in shares, or 2.2 percent of the total, after making no repurchases last year. \n \n Overstated Risks \n \n Shannon Bell, a spokeswoman for Citigroup, declined to comment on what was in the capital plan. Ally said in an e- mailed statement that the Fed\u2019s analysis overstated some risks and didn\u2019t account for some of the auto and home lender\u2019s financial and management resources. \n \n Citigroup\u2019s projected Tier 1 common capital ratio fell to 4.9 percent, below the central bank\u2019s minimum requirement of 5 percent, in a test estimating the effects of a severe economic slump, according to data released by the Fed. Citigroup would surpass the threshold if the bank didn\u2019t pursue a dividend increase or share buyback, according to the Fed\u2019s data. \n \n Citigroup still has more than $200 billion of unwanted assets in the Citi Holdings unit, including more than $100 billion of mortgages, according to a filing. \n \n \u201cWe continue to have the same goals that I mentioned before, which is that this will be the year that we\u2019ll start returning capital,\u201d Pandit told analysts on Jan. 17. \n \n Federal Aid \n \n Ally has benefited from $17.2 billion of federal aid, which it needed after losses swelled on subprime home mortgages made by its Residential Capital mortgage subsidiary. A statement e- mailed by Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Ally, said the Fed\u2019s analysis \u201cdramatically overstates potential contingent mortgage risk, especially with respect to newer vintages of loans.\u201d \n \n The tests also didn\u2019t give enough credit for \u201cmanagement\u2019s track record\u201d and commitment to addressing the mortgage risks, and doesn\u2019t \u201cadequately contemplate contingent capital that already exists,\u201d according to the statement. \n \n The U.S. Treasury holds $5.9 billion of preferred shares that must be converted into common equity no later than Dec. 30, 2016, according to the lender\u2019s annual securities filing. \n \n Ally has considered putting the ResCap unit into bankruptcy, people familiar with the matter have said. Once known as GMAC when it was part of General Motors Co., Ally remains one of the biggest auto lenders and has profited from a recovery in car sales. The U.S. gained a 74 percent stake in the company in return for rescuing Ally in 2008. \n \n Raising Capital \n \n \u201cThey\u2019ve done a lot less capital-raising than others,\u201d said Kirk Ludtke, an analyst at Stamford, Connecticut-based CRT Capital Group LLC. Ally\u2019s capital plan may include additional contributions to ResCap, he said. \n \n SunTrust\u2019s Tier 1 common capital ratio would fall to 4.8 percent if the Atlanta-based lender carried out capital plans submitted to the Fed, according to the test results. Capital plans can include dividend payouts, stock repurchases and share sales. Ally\u2019s ratio was estimated at 2.5 percent, regardless of any capital actions it proposed, according to Fed data. \n \n SunTrust, ranked eighth in the U.S. by deposits, said it would have met Federal Reserve standards without the plan for capital actions that the lender submitted to the regulator. Distributing dividends and share buybacks tend to weaken performance on the tests by draining capital. \n \n Shares in SunTrust rose 66 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $23.23 at 11:50 a.m. in New York trading after the company said first- quarter earnings will probably beat the average estimate compiled by First Call. \n \n Housing Loans \n \n The lender amassed losses amid a housing slump in the nation\u2019s Southeast. After posting profits of more than $1 billion annually before 2008, the company booked a $1.56 billion loss in 2009 as write-offs surged. \n \n About 27 percent of SunTrust\u2019s residential construction loans and 29 percent of its residential mortgages were concentrated in Florida, which suffered some of the worst mortgage defaults during the financial crisis. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think these stress tests are about who needs more capital,\u201d said Michael Rose, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates Inc. \u201cClearly it\u2019s about who can return capital. So maybe what they asked for might have been a little aggressive.\u201d \n \n Rose, who rates the shares \u201coutperform,\u201d said he\u2019d been expecting SunTrust to double its 5-cent quarterly dividend. \u201cIt\u2019s not like they failed by a wide margin,\u201d he said, calling the test\u2019s scenario \u201conerous\u201d and \u201cprobably unrealistic.\u201d \n \n MetLife\u2019s Results \n \n MetLife\u2019s total risk-based capital ratio would be 6 percent, compared with the minimum acceptable level of 8 percent, the Fed said as part of its review of how companies would withstand a \u201cstress scenario.\u201d \n \n The insurer had requested approval for $2 billion in share repurchases and an increase of its annual dividend to $1.10 a share from 74 cents, according to a statement from the New York- based company. MetLife, which is overseen by the Fed because of its banking operations, was prevented by the regulator last year from increasing its dividend. \n \n CEO Steven Kandarian is winding down the banking business and said he expects the firm to have as much as $7 billion of excess capital by the end of this year. Kandarian said he remains \u201cfully committed\u201d to returning funds to shareholders, and that MetLife is on track to stop being a bank holding company by the middle of this year. \n \n \u201cAt the end of the day this is an insurance company,\u201d said Edward Shields, an analyst at Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners LP. MetLife\u2019s inclusion in the Fed test is \u201clike putting a square peg into a round hole.\u201d \n \n Shares in MetLife fell 4.5 percent in New York. The stock gained 27 percent this year through yesterday. \n \n Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), the Cincinnati-based lender, said the Fed objected to increases in its 8-cent quarterly dividend and some common share buybacks. The government didn\u2019t object to its redemption of as much as $1.4 billion in certain trust-preferred securities. \n \n To contact the reporters on this story: Donal Griffin in New York at dgriffin10@bloomberg.net; \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Laura Marcinek in New York at lmarcinek3@bloomberg.net ||||| \u201cIt is night and day,\u201d Jason Goldberg, senior analyst at Barclays Capital Inc. in New York, said before the announcement. \u201cIn 2009, about half the banks failed the stress test.

    "document": "People who know nothing else about Cory Booker know that the 44-year-old Newark mayor is going big places. \n \n The next big entry on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 will very likely be junior U.S. senator from New Jersey, after Booker easily won Tuesday's Democratic primary for the special election to replace the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.). How easily? Booker took 59 percent in a four-person race against two U.S. congressmen and the speaker of the New Jersey State Assembly. \n \n Booker's opponent in the October election will be Republican Steven Lonegan, a former mayor of Bogota, N.J., who promises to run a vigorous \"line-in-the-sand campaign between a conservative and an extreme liberal.\" That's an odd strategy to employ in New Jersey, which hasn't voted to send a Republican to the U.S. Senate since 1972. \n \n But such a campaign will also probably rankle a good number of liberals. Given that Booker will replace a Republican stand-in senator appointed by Gov. Chris Christie, and that Booker will be only the fourth African American elected to the U.S. Senate, \"you would expect that progressives would be excited by Booker's candidacy and his eventual rise to the Senate,\" says Doug Mataconis at Outside the Beltway. You would be wrong. \n \n Salon's Alex Pareene wrote perhaps the most widely cited liberal takedown of Booker, but he's hardly alone. The liberal critique of Booker is essentially that he's too chummy with Wall Street bankers and Silicon Valley moguls, is using those connections and his mayoral perch to enrich himself, and tries to hide his elitist and corporatist tendencies by relentlessly and narcissistically promoting himself as a liberal champion of the little guy. \n \n The progressives are basically right, says David Weigel at Slate. \"A Booker victory will mean the replacement of a reliable, plodding progressive with a less reliable neoliberal.\" In fact, Weigel says, \"the only progressive argument for Booker\" is that he's black and \"the long-term interests of a party that depends on huge minority turnout adding to white liberal turnout are served by promoting nonwhite stars.\" \n \n But not every liberal is so down on Booker. The Newark mayor \"might vote like a Goldman Sachs executive and break John McCain's record for appearing on Sunday morning shows,\" says Martin Longman at Booman Tribune, but in the Senate, he'll get stuff done. If you're a liberal and \"he agrees with you on an issue, he's going to be a valuable advocate.\" \n \n His parents were some of the first black executives at IBM, so Booker wasn't raised in the Hood. He also wasn't sent to any elite prep school. He was a star football player at a well-regarded public high school. He was good enough and smart enough to land a gig at Stanford University, where he became class president. He won a Rhodes Scholarship and studied at Oxford, where he received honors. Then he got a law degree from Yale. Along the way, he found time to do charitable work wherever he went. And then he won a seat on Newark's city council and started butting heads with some seriously corrupt politicians, including the joke of a mayor, Sharpe James. \n \n It's true that spending part of your life studying with kids at Stanford, Yale, and Oxford will color how you view things, but let's not pretend that Cory Booker hasn't been excellent at pretty much everything he's done so far in his life. [Booman Tribune] \n \n And even if many lefty columnists and bloggers still hate Booker, the Newark mayor probably doesn't need to worry. \"Their sentiments don't seem to be shared by the voters,\" says Outside the Beltway's Mataconis. Booker's poll numbers have stayed consistently high despite attacks from his more liberal rivals. Credit Booker's name recognition and carefully curated \"aura of celebrity,\" Mataconis says. \n \n ...there's something of a disconnect between these progressive pundits and the voting public. Much like pundits on the right have their ideal candidates, writers such as Pareene do as well, and Booker quite obviously doesn't fit into that definition. Perhaps it's because he hasn't said the magic words on NSA surveillance or some other issue.... Perhaps it's just because there was never really any suspense in this election and they needed something write about. Whatever the reason, the animus toward Booker on the left has been more than a little surprising especially considering that he is going to be a reliable Democratic vote for as long as he's in the Senate. Given that it's New Jersey and Booker is relatively young, could be quite a long time. [Outside the Beltway] \n \n That's why liberals are breaking out the Sturm und Drang now, says Elspeth Reeve at The Atlantic Wire: \n \n The point doesn't seem to be to stop his election to the Senate \u2014 that looks impossible \u2014 but to make the case for why he shouldn't climb any higher in Democratic politics.... For the Booker un-endorsers, what's at stake in the New Jersey special election is the idea of who the Democratic standard-bearer will be after President Obama. [Atlantic Wire] \n \n Booker, as it turns out, doesn't really seem to disagree with his liberal critics. Raymond Hernandez explains at The New York Times: \n \n As [Booker] campaigned, he portrayed what his opponents saw as a weakness \u2014 that he was insufficiently liberal on issues important to Democrats like gun control and unions \u2014 as a strength. He argued that his pragmatic brand of politics, favoring practical solutions over ideology, had enabled him to lift the fortunes of Newark, the state's largest city. [New York Times] \n \n Since he didn't have to fend of a strong primary challenge from the left, Booker did what most politicians would do positioning themselves for a general election: He ran as a uniter, not a divider. As we've learned, it takes two to unite, but few big-time politicians have ever been punished for pitching that ideal to the masses. ||||| Today New Jersey Democrats will decide who will be their nominee for the United States Senate. The winner of today's primary election will be the heavy favorite in the general election. If any New Jersey voters are reading, and they have not yet voted, consider this a desperate plea: Don't vote for Cory Booker. He's going to be a very annoying senator. \n \n It's fine if you like Booker. He's personable, charming, really good at Twitter, and he has done lots of stunts designed to make people aware of poverty, or at least to make people aware of Cory Booker's awareness of poverty. He is a Good Liberal on many issues. \n \n But he's also an avatar of the wealthy elite, a camera hog, and a political cipher who has never once proposed anything to address the structural causes of the problems he claims to care so deeply about. He represents the interests of both Wall Street and Silicon Valley, two very prosperous industries full of incredibly arrogant rich men who believe that the world's problems would be solved if arrogant rich men exactly like themselves were given free rein to make as much money as possible by any means necessary. They see, in Booker, a peer -- a smart man with the right qualifications and the correct worldview. Booker and his crowd believe that the charity of the benevolent elite -- people who know they are rich because of their innate skill, their brilliance, their work ethic, everything besides fundamentally inequitable distribution of resources and opportunities for economic advancement -- is the only acceptable and effective means of addressing the needs of the lower orders. \n \n Cory Booker became a millionaire because this is how the economy works for people of his class: Rich people give other rich people money to do nothing, simply because they \"deserve\" it. He is the worst sort of Democrat, and Democrats should be doing everything in their power to wrest control of the party away from people like him. \n \n But that is why Cory Booker is bad as a phenomenon. What about his fitness for the specific job he is running for? It is, admittedly, probably not the job he was hoping for. Governors get to have more fun. Time's Jay Newton-Small says Booker would miss retail politics and direct constituent interaction once he's a senator: \n \n Senators don\u2019t fix potholes. Never mind flaming buildings\u2013they rarely even kiss babies. Senators spend their days in meetings: with lobbyists, with interest groups, with other senators, with the administration, with fundraisers and with their leadership. They\u2019re inside operators. \n \n OK, but how do we actually think Booker spends most of his time? Fixing potholes personally, or attending meetings with rich, influential and important people? (Like Jeff Zucker's teenage son?) \n \n In many ways, Booker is perfectly suited for the United States Senate. He won't be expected to accomplish anything. He will have so many more opportunities to spend time with even more rich people with elite backgrounds and worldviews similar to his. He will have much more access to television studios and Sunday shows and cable news cameras. \n \n He will, in short, be the worst kind of senator. The kind that has no power and no real desire to exercise power on behalf of the people the senator ostensibly represents, but the kind that always expresses opinions on television about whatever national issues people on television care about that day. He will be on \"Morning Joe\" and \"Meet the Press\" constantly. He has even already said that he might consider Rand Paul and Ted Cruz as models for how a freshman senator might make \"big marks.\" Not \"big marks\" in the sense of any sort of lasting legislative legacy, because Ted Cruz does not care about legislation or policy, but \"big marks\" in terms of media attention and stunts designed to appeal to a core of supporters who prefer their senators brash and loud. Another one of those senators will not help anything. \n \n It's not like there aren't any other options. Rush Holt would be a fine senator. He's an actual physicist, which is neat. He cares very strongly about global warming, which is probably the single most pressing issue of our era. He will probably not use the Senate seat as a stepping stone to the White House, which means he may actually stick around long enough to gain seniority and someday actually achieve things. \n \n So don't vote for Cory Booker. ||||| By Ed Kilgore \n \n So despite facing two veteran members of Congress and arousing a lot of protests from progressive activists, Newark Mayor Cory Booker won the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate in New Jersey by close to 40 points, winning 59% against Frank Pallone\u2019s 19% and Rush Holt\u2019s 17%. He\u2019ll now face Tea Party activist Steve Lonegan (last seen challenging Chris Christie from the right in a 2009 primary) in a special general election on October 16, which is not expected to be close. Booker will, however, have to do it all over again next year, when the term Frank Lautenberg was elected to in 2008 expires. \n \n The bigger issue for a lot of observers is whether Booker has national ambitions. For admirers, he\u2019s the next Barack Obama, a charismatic African-American pol with possible transpartisan appeal. To detractors, he\u2019s an unholy combination of Harold Ford, Jr. and Joe Lieberman, beholden to Wall Street and Silicon Valley. So his first steps in the Senate will be watched closely.",

Tsai... (Associated Press) \n \n The Democratic Progressive Party's Tsai was poised to become the self-governing island's first female president in an election taking place amid concerns that the island's economy is under threat from China and broad opposition to Beijing's demands for political unification. \n \n Tsai had about 60 percent of votes while Nationalist Eric Chu had about 30 percent, with about half of votes counted. \n \n \"We failed. The Nationalist Party lost the elections. We didn't work hard enough,\" Chu said before a thin crowd of a few hundred supporters at his campaign headquarters. He followed his concession speech by making a long bow. \n \n \"As the Nationalist Party chairperson, I need to pay the highest level of responsibility. Dear all friends, Eric Chu apologizes to everyone. I'm resigning as party chief,\" he said. \n \n Outgoing Nationalist President Ma Ying-jeou has served eight years and is constitutionally barred from another term. \n \n The outcome of the contest for a majority in the 113-seat legislature remained uncertain, with independents and smaller parties posing a threat to both the Nationalists and the DPP. \n \n \"Taiwan and China need to keep some distance,\" said Willie Yao, a computer engineer voting in Taipei who said he backed Tsai. \"The change of president would mean still letting Taiwanese make the decision.\" \n \n Reflecting unease over a slowdown in Taiwan's once-mighty economy, undeclared voter Hsieh Lee-fung said providing opportunities to the next generation was the most important issue. \n \n \"Economic progress is related closely to our leadership, like land reform and housing prices. People aren't making enough money to afford homes,\" Hsieh said. \n \n A win for Tsai would introduce new uncertainty in the complicated relationship between Taiwan and mainland China, which claims the island as its own territory and threatens to use force if it declares formal independence. \n \n \"This is not about defeating the other party. This is about working to overcome the obstacles in Taiwan's path,\" Tsai told supporters in the rain at a final rally Friday night in front of the presidential office building in the center of the capital, Taipei. \n \n Tsai has pledged to maintain the status quo of de-facto independence for the island of 23 million, although she has refused to endorse the principle that Taiwan and China are parts of a single nation to be unified eventually. \n \n Beijing has made that its baseline for continuing negotiations that have produced a series of pacts on trade, transport and exchanges. Observers say China is likely to adopt a wait-and-see approach to Tsai's presidency, but might use diplomatic and economy pressure if she is seen as straying too far from its unification agenda. \n \n Taiwan was a Japanese colony from 1885 to 1945 and split again from China amid civil war in 1949. \n \n Chu was a late entry in the race after the party ditched its original candidate, Hung Hsiu-chu, whose abrasive style was seen as alienating voters. \n \n China has largely declined to comment on the polls, although its chief official for Taiwan affairs this month warned of potential major challenges in the relationship in the year ahead. \n \n Tsai supporters appeared confident that ties with China would weather a change in government. \n \n \"As long as Tsai doesn't provoke the other side, it's OK,\" said former newspaper distribution agent Lenex Chang, who attended Tsai's rally. \"If mainland China democratizes someday, we could consider a tie-up,\" he added. \n \n Candidates from across the political spectrum sounded a rare note of unity Saturday after a teenage pop star posted a video online apologizing for having waved the Taiwanese flag on a South Korean TV program. \n \n Sixteen-year-old Chou Tzu-yu, who performs under the name Tzuyu, had apparently been compelled to apologize after her South Korean management company suspended her activities in China for fear of offending nationalist sentiments on the mainland. \n \n Ma, Tsai and Chu all condemned what they described as the bullying of a young girl. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Ralph Jennings contributed to this report. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Tsai Ing-wen said people in Taiwan wanted a transparent government \n \n Tsai Ing-wen has been elected Taiwan's first female president. \n \n Ms Tsai, 59, leads the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) that wants independence from China. \n \n In her victory speech, she vowed to preserve the status quo in relations with China, adding Beijing must respect Taiwan's democracy and both sides must ensure there are no provocations. \n \n China sees the island as a breakaway province - which it has threatened to take back by force if necessary. \n \n In her speech, Ms Tsai hailed a \"new era\" in Taiwan and pledged to co-operate with other political parties on major issues. \n \n The will of the Taiwanese people would be the basis for relations with China, Ms Tsai said. \n \n \"I also want to emphasise that both sides of the Taiwanese Strait have a responsibility to find mutually acceptable means of interaction that are based on dignity and reciprocity. \n \n \"We must ensure that no provocations or accidents take place,\" Ms Tsai said, warning that \"any forms of suppression will harm the stability of cross-strait relations\". \n \n She thanked the US and Japan for their support and vowed Taiwan would contribute to peace and stability in the region. \n \n Ms Tsai had a commanding lead in the vote count when Eric Chu of the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) admitted defeat. \n \n Mr Chu congratulated Tsai Ing-wen and announced he was quitting as KMT head. Taiwan's Premier Mao Chi-kuo also resigned. \n \n Read more about Taiwan's election \n \n Image copyright EPA \n \n Taiwan's first female leader, shy but steely \n \n Why does this election matter? \n \n Who is running? \n \n Is it all about the economy? \n \n What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? \n \n Taiwan profile \n \n The election came just months after a historic meeting between the leaders of Taiwan and China. \n \n However, the flagging economy as well as Taiwan's relationship with China both played a role in the voters' choice, correspondents say. \n \n The KMT has been in power for most of the past 70 years and has overseen improved relations with Beijing - Ms Tsai's is only the second-ever victory for the DPP. \n \n The first was by pro-independence advocate Chen Shui-bian; during his time as president between 2000 and 2008 tensions with China escalated. \n \n Analysis: Cindy Sui, BBC News, Taipei \n \n The victory by Tsai Ing-wen marks a defeat for not only the pro-unification ruling party KMT but also China. \n \n Despite the past eight years of reduced tensions and much improved relations built by the KMT and China, Taiwanese voters have voted for Ms Tsai from the pro-independence party instead. Basically, they've voted to keep Beijing at a distance. \n \n This reflects not only widespread dissatisfaction with President Ma Ying-jeou of the KMT over insufficient measures to improve the lacklustre economy, low wages and widening wealth gap - it also reflects growing worries by Taiwanese people that the island may become too economically dependent on China and that this will make it hard for Taiwan to fend off pressures by Beijing to reunify with it one day. \n \n The message voters have sent Beijing is that, while they want reduced tensions and good relations, they cherish Taiwan's sovereignty, democracy and self-rule even more. \n \n The challenge now is for Ms Tsai to find a way to work with China, the island's biggest export market, trade partner and security threat. \n \n Ms Tsai, a former scholar, has said she wants to \"maintain [the] status quo\" with China. \n \n She became chairwoman of the DPP in 2008, after it saw a string of corruption scandals. \n \n She lost a presidential bid in 2012 but has subsequently led the party to regional election victories. She has won increased support from the public partly because of widespread dissatisfaction over the KMT and President Ma Ying-jeou's handling of the economy and widening wealth gap. \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Eric Chu's loss shows the KMT has lost a nearly 70-year monopoly on power \n \n Saturday's polls come after a historic meeting between President Ma and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Singapore in November for talks that were seen as largely symbolic - the first in more than 60 years. \n \n Eric Chu, 54, is the mayor of New Taipei City and stepped up to become chairman of the party in October. \n \n The KMT has lost its majority in the legislature for the first time in history. \n \n The former accounting professor was seen as popular with young people in the party, but had been unable to change public opinion that is increasingly unhappy with the party's friendly stance towards China and the island's economic travails. \n \n In 2014, hundreds of students occupied the parliament in the largest show of anti-China sentiment on the island for years. Labelled the Sunflower Movement, protesters demanded more transparency in trade pacts negotiated with China. \n \n Taiwan for all practical purposes been independent since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, when the defeated Nationalist government fled to the island as the Communists, under Mao Zedong, swept to power.",

    "document": "SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain The driver of a Spanish train that derailed, killing at least 80 people, was under police guard in hospital on Thursday after the dramatic accident which an official source said was caused by excessive speed. \n \n The eight-carriage train came off the tracks, hit a wall and caught fire just outside the pilgrimage destination Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain on Wednesday night. It was one of Europe's worst rail disasters. \n \n The source had knowledge of the official investigation into a crash which brought misery to Santiago on Thursday, the day when it should have celebrated one of Europe's biggest Christian festivals. Authorities canceled festivities as the city went into mourning. \n \n The Galicia regional supreme court said in a statement the judge investigating the accident had ordered police to take a statement from the driver. \n \n He was being formally investigated and under police guard but not under arrest, the court said. He was in hospital but it was not clear what kind of injuries he had suffered. \n \n Video footage from a security camera showed the train, with 247 people on board, hurtling into a concrete wall at the side of the track as carriages jack-knifed and the engine overturned. \n \n One local official described the aftermath of the crash as like a scene from hell, with bodies strewn next to the tracks. \n \n The impact was so huge one carriage flew several meters into the air and landed on the other side of a high concrete barrier. \n \n Around 94 people were injured, 35 of them, including four children, in a serious condition, the deputy head of the regional government said. \n \n \"We heard a massive noise and we went down the tracks. I helped get a few injured and bodies out of the train. I went into one of the cars but I'd rather not tell you what I saw there,\" Ricardo Martinez, a 47-year old baker from Santiago de Compostela, told Reuters. \n \n Newspaper accounts cited witnesses as saying the driver, Francisco Jose Garzon, who had helped rescue victims, shouted into a phone: \"I've derailed! What do I do?\". \n \n The 52-year-old had been a train driver for 30 years, said a spokeswoman for Renfe, the state train company. \n \n A court source told Reuters there was one driver on the train. Previously, a Galicia government source had said there were two. \n \n TRAIN HIT BEND AT SPEED \n \n El Pais newspaper said the driver told the railway station by radio after being trapped in his cabin that the train entered the bend at 190 kilometers per hour (120 mph). An official source said the speed limit on that stretch of twin track, laid in 2011, was 80 kph. \n \n \"We're only human! We're only human!\" the driver told the station, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the investigation. \"I hope there are no dead, because this will weigh on my conscience.\" \n \n Investigators were trying to find out why the train was going so fast and why security devices to keep speed within permitted limits had not slowed the train. \n \n Operated by state-owned company Renfe, the train was built by Bombardier and Talgo and was around five years old. It had almost the maximum number of passengers. \n \n Spain's rail safety record is better than the European average, ranking 18th out of 27 countries in terms of railway deaths per kilometers traveled, the European Railway Agency said. There were 218 train accidents in Spain between 2008-2011, well below the EU average of 426 for the same period. \n \n Firefighters called off a strike to help with the disaster, while hospital staff, many operating on reduced salaries because of spending cuts in recession-hit Spain, worked overtime to tend the injured. \n \n The disaster happened at 8.41 p.m. (2:41 p.m. ET) on the eve of a festival dedicated to St. James, one of Jesus's 12 disciples, whose remains are said to rest in Santiago's centuries-old cathedral. \n \n The apostle's shrine is the destination of the famous El Camino de Santiago pilgrimage across the Pyrenees, which has been followed by Christians since the Middle Ages. \n \n \"The main mass (in the cathedral) was transformed from a mass of joy into a mass of mourning,\" said Italian pilgrim Irene Valsangiacomo. \n \n KING, PM VISIT \n \n One U.S. citizen died in the crash and five were injured, the State Department said in Washington. Mexico said one of its nationals was among the dead. \n \n At least one British citizen was injured, a British embassy spokesman said. People from several other countries were believed to be among the passengers. \n \n People living nearby ran to the site to help emergency workers tend to the wounded. Ana Taboada, a 29-year-old hospital worker, was one of the first on the scene. \n \n \"When the dust lifted I saw corpses. I didn't make it down to the track, because I was helping the passengers that were coming up the embankment,\" she told Reuters. \"I saw a man trying to break a window with a stone to help those inside get out.\" \n \n Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who was born in Santiago de Compostela, the capital of Galicia region, visited the site and the main hospital on Thursday. He declared three days of official national mourning for the victims of the disaster. \n \n King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia also went to Santiago and visited the injured in hospital. \n \n \"All of Spain is united in grief with the bereaved families,\" the king said. \n \n Both Renfe and state-owned Adif, which is in charge of the tracks, opened an investigation into the derailment. \n \n Passenger Ricardo Montesco told Cadena Ser radio station the train approached the curve at high speed, twisted and the carriages piled up one on top of the other. \n \n \"A lot of people were squashed on the bottom. We tried to squeeze out of the bottom of the wagons to get out and we realized the train was burning. ... I was in the second carriage and there was fire. ... I saw corpses,\" he said. \n \n Clinics in Santiago de Compostela were overwhelmed with people flocking to give blood, while hotels organized free rooms for relatives. Madrid sent forensic scientists and hospital staff to the scene on special flights. \n \n Allianz Seguros, owned by Germany's Allianz, owns the insurance contract for loss suffered by Renfe passengers, a company spokeswoman told Reuters. The contract does not cover Renfe's trains. The company had sent experts to the scene. \n \n The disaster stirred memories of a train bombing in Madrid in 2004, carried out by Islamist militants, that killed 191 people, although officials do not suspect an attack this time. \n \n Spain is struggling to emerge from a long-running recession marked by government-driven austerity to bring its deeply indebted finances into order. \n \n But Adif, the state railways infrastructure company, told Reuters no budget cuts had been implemented on maintenance of the line, which connects La Coruna, Santiago de Compostela and Ourense and was inaugurated in 2011. \n \n It said more than 100 million euros a year were being spent on track maintenance in Spain. \n \n (Additional reporting by Inmaculada Sanz, Sonya Dowsett, Sarah White, Andres Gonzalez, Blanca Rodriguez, Julien Toyer, Emma Pinedo, Raquel Castillo, Robert Hetz; Writing by Sonya Dowsett and Julien Toyer and Elisabeth O'Leary,; editing by Barry Moody and Andrew Heavens) ||||| Death toll rises to 80, including one American.

(Photo: Antonio Hernandez, El correo Gallego/AP) Story Highlights Train from Madrid may have been traveling 89 to 119 mph in 50-mph zone \n \n All eight carriages left tracks, and four overturned \n \n Accident happened in Santiago de Compostela in the Galicia region \n \n The train that derailed on a curve Wednesday night in northwestern Spain may have been traveling at more than twice the speed limit, media outlets reported Thursday. \n \n The veteran driver, who was injured, is being formally investigated amid reports that he had bragged on Facebook about routinely speeding. Officials said he did not test positive for alcohol or drugs. \n \n Authorities and rail experts cautioned that speed-control systems might also have failed. \n \n The Associated Press analyzed video of the crash and said the train was going between 89 mph and 119 mph on the stretch of track that has a limit of about 50 mph. The Spanish newspaper El Mundo also reported that the train may have approached speeds of up to 119 mph before it flew off the tracks and smashed into a retaining wall. \n \n The U.S. State Department said that one American was among the 80 who died. \n \n The Galician government said 94 others remained hospitalized, with 31, including four children, in critical condition. Five Americans were among the injured, the State Department said, without releasing details. \n \n The Reuters news agency reported that the driver, Francisco Jose Garzon Amo, is in police custody in the hospital, where he is being treated for unspecified injuries. He took over the controls from another driver about 65 miles before the crash, said the state railway, Renfe. \n \n Garzon, 52, has worked for Renfe for 30 years. He became an assistant driver in 2000 and a fully qualified driver in 2003. \n \n He enjoyed going fast. \n \n The New York Times reported that until it was deleted Thursday morning, Garzon's Facebook page \"included a photograph and exchanges that portrayed a taste for speed, and perhaps even recklessness.\" \n \n A March 2012 photo showed a speedometer topped out at 124 mph. \"I'm at the limit and I can't go any faster or they will give me a fine,\" he wrote. \n \n Responding to a friend's quip about speeding, the Times said, Garzon wrote in all caps: \"Imagine what a rush it would be traveling alongside the Civil Guard, and passing them so that their speed traps go off. Hehe, that would be quite a fine for Renfe, hehe.\" \n \n Garzon had worked the Madrid-to-Ferrol run for more than a year, Renfe said. His express train Wednesday was carrying 218 passengers when it left the tracks at 8:41 p.m. local time (2:41 p.m. ET) about 2.5 miles from the station at Santiago de Compostela. The train carried five crewmembers. \n \n One driver who was trapped radioed the rail station that the train was traveling 120 mph when it entered the bend, sources told the Spanish newspaper El Pais. \n \n \"We're only human! We're only human!\" the driver reportedly said. \"I hope there are no dead, because this will fall on my conscience.\" \n \n All eight carriages derailed, and four overturned. TV images showed one car torn apart, another on fire and blanket-covered bodies besides the wrecked carriages. \n \n Hadley Malcolm hosts USA NOW for July 25, 2013, covering the recent train crash in Spain that killed scores of people.

He was discharged Thursday. \n \n Officials canceled festivities planned for Thursday in Santiago de Compostela to celebrate St James, one of Jesus' 12 apostles whose remains are claimed to buried there. Officials said many of the travelers likely were pilgrims headed to the city, about 60 miles south of Ferrol. \n \n Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy Brey, who was born in Santiago de Compostola, toured the crash scene Thursday alongside rescue workers and visited the injured and their families at a nearby hospital.

Thirty-two adults were in critical condition. \n \n Most of the deaths happened at the scene, Rios said. In Spain, judges typically record deaths that take place outside of hospitals. \n \n Judicial teams are still at the crash site and expect to find more bodies, she told CNN on Thursday morning. \n \n Interim charge d'affaires Luis G. Moreno at the embassy said it was in touch \"with families of some injured American citizens.\" \n \n \"We are deeply shocked by the news of last night's train crash in Galicia. Our hearts and prayers are with the friends and families of the victims,\" he said Thursday. \n \n UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said one British citizen was injured. \n \n The crash came on the eve of a public holiday held to mark the region's saint's day. Local officials canceled festivities planned for Wednesday night and Thursday across Galicia. \n \n Train's speed questioned \n \n The state railway, Renfe, said the train crashed on a curve several kilometers from the train station in the city of Santiago de Compostela, a popular tourist destination. \n \n The train was nearing the end of a six-hour trip from Madrid to the town of Ferrol in northwest Spain when it derailed at 8:41 p.m. Wednesday, the railway said. \n \n JUST WATCHED Expert: Speed may not be only factor Replay More Videos ...

It was capable of going up to 250 kilometers per hour (155 mph), said Julio Hermida, a spokesman for the state railway. \n \n The driver, who suffered minor injuries, told police the train had entered the bend too fast, TVE reported. \n \n The driver has worked for the company for the last 30 years, a spokesman for the railway confirmed to CNN. In 2000, the driver started working as a train driver assistant, and in 2003 began working as a train driver, a job the driver has held since. \n \n Rafael Catala, secretary of state for transport and housing, told Spanish radio network Cadena SER that the \"tragedy appears to be linked to the train going too fast,\" but that the reasons for that are not yet known. \n \n Spanish news agency Efe and national daily El Pais cited sources within the investigation as saying that the driver had said the train was going at about 190 kilometers per hour, and that the limit on that curve was 80 kilometers per hour (50 mph.) \n \n The president of Renfe, Julio Gomez-Pomar, told radio station COPE on Thursday that the train had undergone a routine inspection that same morning. \n \n \"The train did not have an operating problem,\" he said. \"The maintenance and control record of the train was perfect.\" \n \n Mourning declared \n \n Spain's King Juan Carlos visited a hospital in Santiago de Compostela where victims injured in Wednesday's train accident are recovering. \n \n \"All Spaniards, we are united at this time. ... Really all Spaniards join in the pain of the families of the dead,\" he said. \"We hope that the wounded will recover, little by little.\" \n \n The royal family canceled all events scheduled for the day out of respect for the day of mourning, the royal household told CNN. \n \n Alberto Nunez Feijoo, head of the regional government in Galicia, declared seven days of mourning in the region for victims of the tragedy. \n \n In a speech, he said \"all of the community cries about the tragedy that we are living, we cry for the victims, we cry for the unease and sadness of the families.\" \n \n Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy viewed the scene of devastation Thursday morning and visited some of the hospitalized crash victims. \n \n Rajoy, who is from the area, told a news conference there was a \"huge challenge\" ahead, not least in identifying all those killed and informing their families, and he praised the response of everyone who has helped after the crash. \n \n Two investigations are under way, he said, adding, \"We want to establish what happened.\" \n \n Rajoy declared three days of national mourning to honor the victims of the crash. \n \n The prime minister came under fire in Spanish media after a condolences message for the train crash victims posted by his office late Wednesday included a paragraph apparently \"copied and pasted\" from a statement previously sent to victims of an earthquake in Gansu, China. \n \n ''I would like to express my deepest condolences for the loss of human lives and the material damage from the earthquake that has occurred in Gansu has caused,\" the note said. \n \n Victim: 'Everything went dark' \n \n One victim, speaking from a hospital bed with his arm in a sling, told CNN affiliate Atlas that it seemed like train was going fast. \n \n \"But we didn't know what was the maximum speed, so I thought it was normal,\" he said, \"And suddenly there was a curve, the suitcases fell, and everything went dark. And I hit my head a ton of times, and 10 seconds later I was wedged between seats, and I had people's legs on top of me.\" \n \n As he waited for rescuers to pull him from the wreckage, he heard other passengers yelling. \n \n \"I heard little children screaming. ... I also heard two girls that yelled out, one supporting the other,\" he said. \n \n Rescuers came through it and helped the 18-year-old from Bountiful, Utah, get out. \n \n He waited for hours while victims with more serious injuries were taken to the hospital. As he watched rescue crews carry the dead and wounded, he cried and sang church hymns to calm himself down. \n \n A photo taken at the scene shows him leaning on a police officer as he walked beside the tracks, with blood oozing down his face and splattered on his crisp, white shirt. \n \n The Mormon missionary walked past dead bodies on the ground. He told London's Daily Telegraph that it looked like a scene from hell. \n \n U.S. citizen among those killed \n \n When the train crashed, Ana-Maria Cordoba was on the way with her husband and their daughter to visit her son, who had been on a pilgrimage in Spain, the Catholic Diocese of Arlington told CNN. \n \n Cordoba, who worked for the diocese, was killed, spokesman Michael Donahue said. \n \n Her husband and daughter are hospitalized in stable condition, the diocese said. \n \n Crash investigation \n \n Investigators are looking at all possible causes of the crash, a senior aide to the prime minister said Wednesday. \n \n Renfe's spokesman said he did not know how many crew members were aboard the train when it crashed. Normally, there would be at least five crew members on a train like that, he said. \n \n Officials appealed for blood donations just after the crash but on Thursday said the short-term needs were met. \n \n Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, expressed condolences from the European Union. \n \n Pope Francis, who is on a visit to Brazil for World Youth Day, sent a telegram to the bishop of Santiago de Compostela, Julian Barrio Barrio, offering his support and prayers for all those affected by the tragedy. ||||| A passenger train derailed in northwestern Spain on Wednesday night, killing at least 35 people and leaving hundreds injured, officials said. \n \n Emergency personnel respond to the scene of a train derailment in Santiago de Compostela, Spain, on Wednesday, July 24, 2013.

Renfe did not give an estimate of the numbers of dead or injured. \n \n Feast day festivities planned in the city of Santiago de Compostela were cancelled, town hall spokeswoman Maria Pardo told Spanish National television TVE. \n \n A photographer at the scene said he saw dozens of what appeared to be dead bodies being extracted from the wreck by emergency workers. TVE showed footage of what appeared to be several bodies covered by blankets alongside the tracks next to the damaged train wagons. \n \n The photographer, Xabier Martinez, told The Associated Press that he also spoke to two injured train passengers who said they felt a strong vibration before the derailing. \n \n The accident occurred along a high-speed stretch of track near the train station in Santiago de Compostola, 95 kilometers (60 miles) south of El Ferrol. Rescue workers were seen in the television images caring for people still inside some of the wagons. \n \n Television footage also showed one wagon pointing upwards into the air with one of its ends twisted and disfigured. Another carriage had left the track altogether and could be seen resting on a nearby road. \n \n The train, which belongs to the state-owned Renfe company, was headed to El Ferrol from Madrid. \n \n Officials at the Interior Ministry and the Adif rail infrastructure authority did not immediately answer telephone calls or return messages seeking comment. Officials with Renfe also did not immediately return messages seeking comment. ||||| SANTIAGO DE COMPOSTELA, Spain \u2014 The train driver did little to hide his taste for speed. He posted a photograph of a locomotive speedometer needle stuck at 200 kilometers, or about 125 miles, per hour on Facebook last year, boasting that the reading \u201chas not been tampered with\u201d and openly relishing the idea of racing past the authorities. \n \n \u201cImagine what a rush it would be traveling alongside the Civil Guard, and passing them so that their speed traps go off,\u201d he wrote, in all capitals. \u201cHehe, that would be quite a fine for Renfe, hehe,\u201d referring to his employer, the Spanish rail company. \n \n Now that train driver, Francisco Jos\u00e9 Garz\u00f3n Amo, a veteran with more than three decades of experience, is under investigation by a judge in connection with one of Europe\u2019s worst rail accidents in recent years. \n \n In a chilling video from a security camera, the passenger train he was driving rounded a curve at high speed on Wednesday night, tumbling violently off the track, slamming against a curved wall and piling up in a twisted wreck. Eighty people were killed. \n \n On Thursday, Spanish news media reported that the driver had said the train\u2019s speed had been about 120 miles per hour, more than double the limit in the stretch of track where the train derailed. On the day of the wreck, he took over from another driver just 60 miles before the crash, according to Spanish news reports. \n \n The train was almost full, carrying more than 200 passengers and merrymakers returning to the region for a special holiday on Thursday. July 25 is the feast day for St. James the Apostle, the patron saint of Spain, who for centuries has inspired pilgrims to walk El Camino de Santiago, or the Way of St. James. The pilgrimage has had a burst of popularity in recent years, drawing walkers from around the world. \n \n After the crash, the city of Santiago de Compostela canceled its extensive celebration and the authorities urged people to donate blood. Thousands made a very different kind of pilgrimage to the site of the disaster, watching as rescuers used cranes and trucks to hoist the engines of the wrecked train. All \u2014 children, teenagers and older people \u2014 stood in funereal silence. \n \n Nearby, in a building where an information center had been set up, police officers kept the victims\u2019 families from the public eye. Some walked around the building in tears, hugging and comforting one another, while others grew frustrated waiting to see their loved ones. \n \n \u201cNow, at 9:30 p.m., is when they allowed us to go and see our family member,\u201d said Mar\u00eda, a relative of a victim who did not want her full name used. \u201cTwenty-four hours waiting, in these conditions. That\u2019s too much.\u201d \n \n Most high-speed lines that are part of the European rail traffic system are covered by a GPS-based surveillance network that constantly monitors trains\u2019 speed and automatically brakes them at speed limits. \n \n Slower trains and trains crossing urban areas in Spain and other countries use a less intrusive system that warns the driver with sound and lights at excessive speeds, but does not automatically brake the train, according to Mar\u00eda Carmen Palao, a spokeswoman for Spain\u2019s ADIF rail infrastructure company. \n \n The accident, she said, took place two to three miles outside the station at Santiago de Compostela, in the \u201ctransition zone\u201d between the two systems. The wreck occurred on the Galicia line, run by the rail operator Renfe and opened in 2011. \n \n The train\u2019s driver survived the accident with light injuries and is under police guard, although he has not been formally arrested. He is \u201clucid and able to speak,\u201d said Carmen Prieto, a spokeswoman for the Spanish Development Ministry. \n \n The Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds reported that people at the train company said that alcohol had not been found in the driver\u2019s system, but the security video showing the train barreling into the turn and abruptly careening off the rails quickly raised concerns that he was traveling too fast. \n \n Even in his Facebook message, posted in 2012 but removed late Thursday morning, Mr. Garz\u00f3n elicited some astounded comments from friends. \n \n \u201cDude, you\u2019re going full speed, braaaaake,\u201d one commenter wrote. \n \n \u201cChrist, you\u2019re doing 200km/h,\u201d another said. \n \n Outpourings of sympathy for Wednesday\u2019s disaster came from all corners, including the White House. \u201cOn behalf of the American people, we offer our deepest sympathies and condolences,\u201d President Obama said in a statement. The State Department confirmed Thursday that one American died and five were injured in the accident. \n \n In a letter to Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, the president of the European Commission, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by the accident. \u201cSuch a serious accident, with so many people dead and injured, is a tragedy for Spain and provokes such deep emotions,\u201d he said. \n \n Mr. Rajoy, who was born in the region, visited the scene and declared three days of official mourning. King Juan Carlos and his wife, Sof\u00eda, also rushed to Santiago de Compostela. \n \n \u201cIn the face of a tragedy such as just happened in Santiago de Compostela on the eve of its big day, I can only express my deepest sympathy as a Spaniard and a Galician,\u201d Mr. Rajoy said in a written statement. \n \n The eight-car train, which left Madrid at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, was traveling to the coast when it derailed around 8:44 p.m., according to the clock on the security video. Witnesses described the destruction as the dead were taken to a temporary morgue. \u201cThe road is full of cadavers,\u201d a radio reporter, Xaime L\u00f3pez, said on the station Cadena Ser. \u201cIt\u2019s striking: you almost can\u2019t even count them.\u201d \n \n The accident was Spain\u2019s worst train crash since 1972, when 86 people were killed in the southwest of the country.",

But the fifth time she sought a replacement, eBay's stock had run dry. That's when the Utah mom turned to Facebook, asking friends to share her request for the shirt along with her offer to pay whatever it cost, plus shipping. \"It has to be this exact shirt!\" Skouson wrote on Aug. 7. \"We've tried similar shirts, and they don't cut it with Cami!\" As of Thursday, no less than 150 matching shirts have arrived at her door from as far away as Germany, reports the Daily Dot. \"At first, my daughter was a little confused to see more than one of her 'pink flower shirts.' I explained to her that people gave them to her because they loved her,\" says Skouson, a special education teacher, noting people have offered to make teddy bears, pillows, and blankets for her 10-year-old out of any extra shirts. She adds she tearfully accepted an offer from Target\u2014which sells the Circo-brand item and heard about the story\u2014to make larger versions of the shirt so Cami can wear it even when she's an adult. \"It's been very, very touching,\" Skouson tells KUTV. \"These are all total strangers,\" she wrote on Facebook. \"People are inherently good and kind, and I'm glad I've been able to be a recipient of that kindness.\" (A photo of a cake decorated by someone with autism also went viral.)",

The journalist had reported from all over the world for Time magazine, the New York Times and the Guardian, among others. Her boyfriend told the court she was \u201cincredibly ambitious\u201d and \u201camazingly curious\u201d. \n \n Madsen looked crushed as he heard the verdict, sitting motionless for close to a minute with his eyes closed and his head bowed, in contrast to his behaviour during the trial, when he had looked frequently around the courtroom. He then left to confer with his defence lawyer, Betina Hald Engmark, who announced on their return that he would appeal. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Peter Madsen in front of his homemade submarine in Copenhagen, Denmark. Photograph: Mikko Suominen/Getty Images \n \n The case has gripped Denmark ever since Wall failed to return from a trip on Madsen\u2019s self-built Nautilus submarine on 10 August. Madsen was a semi-celebrity at the time of his arrest, having made a name for himself with three self-built submarines and two crowdfunded manned space projects. \n \n \n \n Burk\u00f8 said his version of events \u2013 that Wall died when an accident filled the vessel with toxic exhaust fumes \u2013 was \u201cnot credible and not consistent with the following decision to dismember the body\u201d. Madsen had changed his explanation for Wall\u2019s death several times, Burk\u00f8 noted. \n \n She said the court instead believed the prosecution\u2019s theory that he had sexually tortured Wall to fulfil a violent sexual fantasy. \n \n It is very unusual for a life sentence to be handed down for the murder of a single person in Denmark, where prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment serve an average of 16 years. \n \n Madsen admitted to just one of the four charges, mistreatment of a corpse. He confessed in October to dismembering Wall\u2019s body after divers found her head, legs and clothing in K\u00f8ge Bay, claiming it had been necessary to cut it up in order to remove it from the submarine. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen gives a media briefing after the verdict. Photograph: Scanpix Denmark/Reuters \n \n Over the course of the 11-day trial, spread over seven weeks, prosecutors presented their case in often horrific detail. But Madsen himself refused to go into detail in court, calling Wall\u2019s death \u201ca very, very traumatic event which I do not want to describe\u201d. \n \n When he was arrested in August, Madsen initially claimed to have dropped Wall off on land, but he almost immediately admitted that she had died onboard and that he had then \u201cburied her at sea\u201d. \n \n At first, he said her skull had been crushed by a heavy latch, but after the discovery of Wall\u2019s head, he said she had been asphyxiated, claiming to have come up with his first story to spare Wall\u2019s parents. \n \n \n \n During the trial, the court heard from a woman to whom Madsen had confessed that he was \u201ca psychopath, but a loving one\u201d, a judgment backed up by a forensic psychiatric report that described Madsen as a \u201cperverse polymorph\u201d with \u201cpsychopathic traits\u201d. \n \n Such was the interest in the trial that the Copenhagen district court opened up a special room with a video link on some days to accommodate as many as 115 journalists from 15 countries. Wall\u2019s parents attended the trial most days and quietly took notes from specially reserved seats beside the media section. \n \n Madsen expressed his regret when asked to make a closing statement at the end of the trial. \u201cThe only thing I want to say is that I\u2019m very, very sorry for what has happened,\u201d he said. \n \n Madsen was also ordered to pay damages to Wall\u2019s boyfriend. \n \n \u2022 This article was amended on 26 April 2018. An earlier version said Peter Madsen was found guilty of reckless sailing and ordered to pay damages to Wall\u2019s parents.",

Madsen had maintained that he did not murder Wall, but did admit to cutting up her body and disposing of it in the sea after what he said was an accidental death. The New York Times reports prosecutor Jakob Buch-Jepsen had argued Madsen was fixated on murdering a woman after a rocket launch was scrapped on Aug. 8, two days before Wall died. Buch-Jepsen said Madsen texted three women an invitation to meet him on the sub but was turned down. Wall boarded the sub on Aug. 10 for an interview that she had tried to secure for months; Madsen had texted her that day with the invite. \"It was random chance that it turned out to be Kim Wall,\" Buch-Jepsen said.

I've lost my ability to obtain a Stanford degree.

Turner attempted to run, leaving the woman in the dirt, before being tackled by the men. \n \n \"One needs to recognize the influence that peer pressure and the attitude of having to fit in can have on someone,\" Turner said in his statement. \"One decision has the potential to change your entire life.\"",

Pictures, Clay Enos) \n \n While Marvel has enjoyed hit after hit, from \u201cIron Man\u201d to \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d Warner Bros. has had a spotty past with its DC Comics adaptations. Batman and Superman can deliver predictably big box-office numbers, but beyond those guys, all bets are off. Remember the \u201cCatwoman\u201d catastrophe of 2004? Not to mention the two consecutive bombs \u201cJonah Hex,\u201d in 2010, and \u201cThe Green Lantern\u201d the following year. \n \n Warner Bros. is doubling down on its golden boys: In addition to \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d with Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne, Warner plans to release two other Justice League movies. The directive is clear: Replicate the success of Marvel\u2019s \u201cAvengers\u201d franchise, and pray that Affleck doesn\u2019t pull a Clooney. \n \n The 2016 release of \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d is another copycat move. The comic book features a crew of antiheroes, who are sprung from jail to become covert operatives for the good guys. Sound familiar? \n \n Here\u2019s the problem: The great asset of Marvels movies like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and \u201cCaptain America\u201d is their sense of humor. Warner\u2019s superheroes lean much more somber. And the fact that David Ayer, the man behind dark action films like \u201cFury\u201d and \u201cTraining Day,\u201d is set to direct \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d doesn\u2019t suggest a fun romp. \n \n Marvel\u2019s casting has also been exceptional. Warner Bros., meanwhile, is betting big on newcomers. First there\u2019s Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman \u2014 and, credit where it\u2019s due, good for them for finally making a female superhero movie. Also noteworthy: Warner has hired openly gay actor Ezra Miller to star in \u201cThe Flash\u201d (to be released in 2018). Though acclaimed for \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower,\u201d few multiplex-goers know who he is. Jason Momoa, the \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d warlord lined up to play Aquaman, has only slightly better name recognition. Though, hey, at least there\u2019s Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson cast as Black Adam in \u201cShazam.\u201d In other news, Warner will reboot \u201cGreen Lantern,\u201d in 2020, not even a decade after the Ryan Reynolds incarnation bombed. If at first you don\u2019t succeed. . . \n \n Director James Gunn brings \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" that follows a motley team of otherworldly misfits, including a talking raccoon, led by Chris Pratt's character. The film opens Friday. . (Walt Disney Pictures) \n \n Of course, the superhero genre might hang on for another decade. Westerns delighted audiences for ages. But box office numbers overall are down for the year. \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d is the number one movie so far, but with a little more than $326 million, that\u2019s not as impressive as last year\u2019s top superhero movie, \u201cIron Man 3\u201d ($409 million), which wasn\u2019t even number one domestically. \u201cThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire\u201d brought in more than $424 million. How many more times will people pay to see Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark or a muscled Hugh Jackman with mutton chops as Wolverine? \n \n It looks like Warner Bros. is running hard to catch up when it might be smarter to focus on the next big thing. ||||| Well played, Warner Bros. Just when everyone thinks that Robert Downey Jr.\u2019s potential return as Tony Stark is the biggest news of the week\u2014well, if someone can return before they\u2019ve actually left, considering he\u2019s still signed up for the next two Avengers movies\u2014you go and drop the names, dates, and casting announcements for no fewer than 10 movies during a conference call. Well played indeed. Here are the highlights of the week\u2019s superhero movie news. \n \n SUPER IDEA: Warner\u2019s Making a Lot of Superhero Movies Over The Next Five Years \n \n Warner Bros. has finally unveiled plans for its DC Comics properties on the big screen. We all knew that Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was coming in 2016, but during a conference call yesterday Warners CEO Kevin Tsujihara announced it\u2019ll be joined by a Suicide Squad movie directed by David Ayer. In 2017, there will be a solo Wonder Woman movie and the first of two Justice League movies. The following year Warner Bros. will release The Flash and Aquaman, with Ezra Miller and Jason Momoa in the lead roles, respectively. In 2019, we\u2019ll get Shazam and Justice League Part Two (Really, that\u2019s the title), with 2020 offering up a new Green Lantern movie and a solo Cyborg movie, starring Ray Fisher. Yes, we\u2019re already talking about movies that\u2019ll be coming out six years from now. \n \n Why this is super: Beyond the simple fact of Warner\u2019s stepping up and declaring its intentions, there\u2019s a lot to unpack here. Warner Bros. has beaten Marvel to the punch of not only a solo female-led superhero movie, but also superhero movies with non-white leads: Aquaman and Shazam, and possibly even Green Lantern, depending which Lantern they choose to focus on. More to the point, the scale of this announcement shows that Marvel will very soon have a serious competitor in the superhero movie business, one that\u2019s in it for the long haul and may even outpace Marvel in terms of production. The official announcement of these movies hinted that even more DC projects could be revealed for the time period, including solo Batman and Superman projects. The race is on. Or, rather, it will be on in 2016. \n \n SUPER IDEA \u2026 MAYBE: Captain America 3 Will Have Cap Take on Iron Man \n \n So it turns out that Robert Downey Jr. might not be making a fourth Iron Man movie\u2014because he\u2019s actually in talks to appear in the third Captain America instead \u2026 as the bad guy, oddly enough. According to Variety, the Marvel movies are expected to follow the direction of the 2006 comic book series Civil War, with Stark and Cap coming to blows over whether or not superheroes should register their identities with authorities. (This is a heavy-handed gun control metaphor, everyone.) \n \n Is this super?: On the plus side: More Robert Downey Jr. playing himself in a suit of superheroic armor! On the slightly more ambivalent side: There\u2019s a risk in bringing the Civil War storyline to movies, and not just because the comic book was about as subtle as someone dropping an anvil on your head. For one thing, it arguably turned Iron Man into a bad guy and turned many readers against him for awhile, and that seems like a road that movie audiences might not appreciate. For another, do we really want to see another movie where Cap fights against a corrupt system he\u2019s already entirely complicit with, using only his unshakable moral system, chiseled jaw, and utter lack of personality? Wasn\u2019t that exactly what happened last time, as good as it was? For now, let\u2019s chalk it up to \u201cTo Be Continued,\u201d instead of passing judgment. Isn\u2019t that how superhero stories should end, anyway? \n \n SUPER IDEA: Michael Keaton Becoming Batman Again \n \n In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Michael Keaton said he\u2019d play Bruce Wayne again \u201cin a heartbeat\u201d\u2014as long as Tim Burton was directing. \u201cHe started everything, and some of the guys who have done these movies since then don\u2019t say that, and they\u2019re wrong,\u201d Birdman star added. \n \n Why this is super: There are many who feel that Christopher Nolan did the best Batman movies, but Burton definitely made the most interesting ones (Batman Returns, anyone?). The idea of Burton and Keaton re-teaming now to do another one is very exciting indeed, even if it is almost entirely unlikely to happen considering that whole Ben Affleck thing. But we can dream\u2026 \n \n SUPER IDEA: Hawkeye In A Solo Movie? Sure, Why Not? \n \n During a Reddit AMA, Jeremy Renner backtracked on earlier comments about his Marvel character going it alone. \u201cAm I interested?\u201d he wrote in response to the prospect being raised. \u201cAlways have been interested. I always love Clint, and in the last Avengers: Age of Ultron, we got to dive into him some more. Very excited about the outcome of it, and where it can go in the future.\u201d It\u2019s ultimately up to Marvel, he said. \u201cIt all comes down to \u2026 how the puppeteers at Marvel can manifest a story that\u2019s worthy of a solo movie. Not sure what that is, or how that is, but I\u2019m confident they can do whatever they want, if they want to do it.\u201d \n \n Why this is super: If someone at Marvel Studios hasn\u2019t thought about trying to adapt Matt Fraction and David Aja\u2019s Hawkeye series for the big screen yet, we\u2019d be very surprised. And if they haven\u2019t, it\u2019s clearly time to start. \n \n SUPER IDEA: Darkness. No Parents. \n \n Nevermind all the other DC news: A movie featuring Will Arnett\u2019s Lego Batman is being fast-tracked, according to reports. It\u2019s going to be directed by Chris McKay, who was the animation supervisor on The Lego Movie, with that movie\u2019s writers acting as executive producers. It\u2019s likely to hit theaters in 2017. \n \n Why this is super: If you saw The Lego Movie, you know why. If you didn\u2019t, then you should really watch The Lego Movie, because it is\u2014if you\u2019ll pardon the cliche\u2014awesome. More importantly, you\u2019ll get to meet the none-more-dark Batman, who is as vain, lacking in self-awareness, and hilarious as you\u2019ve always suspected the Dark Knight would be. More of that just might be the best movie news of the year.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 News that Warner Bros. is planning no fewer than 10 DC comics movies in the next six years is great news for superhero fans, yes? No, writes Stephanie Merry at the Washington Post. In fact, the announcement might just herald the end of the genre. \"Decades from now, cinephiles will look back on the early 2000s as the Superhero Era\u2014and they\u2019ll be able to pinpoint the moment when the bubble burst,\" she writes of the studio's announcement. This kind of bubble-bursting happens with any film trend, from film noir to westerns to spy movies, and the move by Warner Bros. seems likely to speed things up. The studio is desperately trying to overtake Marvel (Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy) as king of the superhero flicks, but in doing so it will only worsen the glut of such movies, writes Merry. People are going to get bored. \"It looks like Warner Bros. is running hard to catch up when it might be smarter to focus on the next big thing,\" she concludes. Those looking for antidote to the skepticism can check out Graeme McMillan at Wired, who loves most of the new DC Comics lineup. With Wonder Woman, for example, \"Warner Bros. has beaten Marvel to the punch of not only a solo female-led superhero movie, but also superhero movies with non-white leads: Aquaman and Shazam.\" Taken as a whole, the 10-movie schedule is, in a word, \"super,\" and the heightened competition could lead to bigger, better movies from both studios.

Multiple sources confirm, however, that the decision to bring HoC to an end was made months ago and was not in response to the allegations. (A Netlix rep confirms this.) \n \n Last June, TVLine asked House of Cards co-showrunners Melissa James Gibson and Frank Pugliese about an end date, to which they responded, \u201cIt\u2019s not entirely up to us,\u201d before acknowledging that the show is in \u201cnew terrain\u201d creatively. \n \n At the conclusion of Season 5, Spacey\u2019s Francis handed the Commander in Chief reins over to wife/first lady Claire (Robin Wright) and exited the political arena (at least the official one) altogether. \u201cIt\u2019s a significant pivot at the end of Season 5,\u201d Gibson noted. \u201cWe\u2019re saying that there\u2019s power beyond the power.

But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.\u201d \n \n Spacey also took the opportunity to set the record straight about his sexuality. \u201cI have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man,\u201d he said. The Oscar winner\u2019s statement was met with a swift backlash from the gay community, with GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis lamenting, \u201cComing-out stories should not be used to deflect from allegations of sexual assault.\u201d \n \n House of Cards creator Beau Willimon, who stepped away from the series at the end of Season 4, released a statement of his own via Twitter early Monday. \n \n My statement regarding Anthony Rapp and Kevin Spacey: pic.twitter.com/8z6zotHWE5 \u2014 Beau Willimon (@BeauWillimon) October 30, 2017 \n \n House of Cards\u2018 sixth and final season will premiere in 2018.",

(The Associated Press) \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on this any further until [congressional] committees have come to a conclusion,\u201d he said, while contrasting the media\u2019s alleged \u201clack\u201d of interest in these revelations with the intense coverage of suspected Trump-Russia links. \n \n When names of Americans are incidentally collected, they are supposed to be masked, meaning the name or names are redacted from reports \u2013 whether it is international or domestic collection, unless it is an issue of national security, crime or if their security is threatened in any way. There are loopholes and ways to unmask through backchannels, but Americans are supposed to be protected from incidental collection. Sources told Fox News that in this case, they were not. \n \n This comes in the wake of Evelyn Farkas\u2019 television interview last month in which the former Obama deputy secretary of defense said in part: \u201cI was urging my former colleagues and, frankly speaking, the people on the Hill \u2013 it was more actually aimed at telling the Hill people, get as much information as you can, get as much intelligence as you can, before President Obama leaves the administration.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, Fox News also is told that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes knew about unmasking and leaking back in January, well before President Trump\u2019s tweet in March alleging wiretapping. \n \n Nunes has faced criticism from Democrats for viewing pertinent documents on White House grounds and announcing their contents to the press. But sources said \u201cthe intelligence agencies slow-rolled Nunes. He could have seen the logs at other places besides the White House SCIF [secure facility], but it had already been a few weeks. So he went to the White House because he could protect his sources and he could get to the logs.\u201d \n \n As the Obama administration left office, it also approved new rules that gave the NSA much broader powers by relaxing the rules about sharing intercepted personal communications and the ability to share those with 16 other intelligence agencies. \n \n Rice is no stranger to controversy. As the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, she appeared on several Sunday news shows to defend the adminstration's later debunked claim that the Sept. 11, 2012 attacks on a U.S. consulate in Libya was triggered by an Internet video. \n \n Rice also told ABC News in 2014 that Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl \"served the United States with honor and distinction\" and that he \"wasn't simply a hostage; he was an American prisoner of war captured on the battlefield.\" \n \n Bergdahl is currently facing court-martial on charges of desertion and misbehavior before the enemy for allegedly walking off his post in Afghanistan. \n \n Adam Housley joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in 2001 and currently serves as a Los Angeles-based senior correspondent. ||||| Eli Lake is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering national security and foreign policy. He was the senior national security correspondent for the Daily Beast and covered national security and intelligence for the Washington Times, the New York Sun and UPI. Read more opinion SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n Photographer: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Photographer: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images \n \n White House lawyers last month learned that the former national security adviser Susan Rice requested the identities of U.S. persons in raw intelligence reports on dozens of occasions that connect to the Donald Trump transition and campaign, according to U.S. officials familiar with the matter. \n \n The pattern of Rice's requests was discovered in a National Security Council review of the government's policy on \"unmasking\" the identities of individuals in the U.S. who are not targets of electronic eavesdropping, but whose communications are collected incidentally. Normally those names are redacted from summaries of monitored conversations and appear in reports as something like \"U.S. Person One.\" \n \n Nunes Says Trump Team Caught in U.S. Surveillance Net \n \n The National Security Council's senior director for intelligence, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, was conducting the review, according to two U.S. officials who spoke with Bloomberg View on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. In February Cohen-Watnick discovered Rice's multiple requests to unmask U.S. persons in intelligence reports that related to Trump transition activities. He brought this to the attention of the White House General Counsel's office, who reviewed more of Rice's requests and instructed him to end his own research into the unmasking policy. \n \n The intelligence reports were summaries of monitored conversations -- primarily between foreign officials discussing the Trump transition, but also in some cases direct contact between members of the Trump team and monitored foreign officials. One U.S. official familiar with the reports said they contained valuable political information on the Trump transition such as whom the Trump team was meeting, the views of Trump associates on foreign policy matters and plans for the incoming administration. \n \n Rice did not respond to an email seeking comment on Monday morning. Her role in requesting the identities of Trump transition officials adds an important element to the dueling investigations surrounding the Trump White House since the president's inauguration. \n \n Both the House and Senate intelligence committees are probing any ties between Trump associates and a Russian influence operation against Hillary Clinton during the election. The chairman of the House intelligence committee, Representative Devin Nunes, is also investigating how the Obama White House kept tabs on the Trump transition after the election through unmasking the names of Trump associates incidentally collected in government eavesdropping of foreign officials. \n \n Rice herself has not spoken directly on the issue of unmasking. Last month when she was asked on the \"PBS NewsHour\" about reports that Trump transition officials, including Trump himself, were swept up in incidental intelligence collection, Rice said: \"I know nothing about this,\" adding, \"I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that account today.\" \n \n Rice's requests to unmask the names of Trump transition officials do not vindicate Trump's own tweets from March 4 in which he accused Obama of illegally tapping Trump Tower. There remains no evidence to support that claim. \n \n But Rice's multiple requests to learn the identities of Trump officials discussed in intelligence reports during the transition period does highlight a longstanding concern for civil liberties advocates about U.S. surveillance programs. The standard for senior officials to learn the names of U.S. persons incidentally collected is that it must have some foreign intelligence value, a standard that can apply to almost anything. This suggests Rice's unmasking requests were likely within the law. \n \n The news about Rice also sheds light on the strange behavior of Nunes in the last two weeks. It emerged last week that he traveled to the White House last month, the night before he made an explosive allegation about Trump transition officials caught up in incidental surveillance. At the time he said he needed to go to the White House because the reports were only on a database for the executive branch. It now appears that he needed to view computer systems within the National Security Council that would include the logs of Rice's requests to unmask U.S. persons. \n \n The ranking Democrat on the committee Nunes chairs, Representative Adam Schiff, viewed these reports on Friday. In comments to the press over the weekend he declined to discuss the contents of these reports, but also said it was highly unusual for the reports to be shown only to Nunes and not himself and other members of the committee. \n \n Indeed, much about this is highly unusual: if not how the surveillance was collected, then certainly how and why it was disseminated. \n \n This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners. \n \n To contact the author of this story: \n \n Eli Lake at elake1@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: \n \n Philip Gray at philipgray@bloomberg.net ||||| The panel on Morning Joe, Tuesday, was understandably befuddled by revelations that former White House National Security Adviser Susan Rice requested the unmasking of names of Trump transition officials. \n \n Hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski began by playing a clip of Rice on PBS denying claims made by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes that Trump and his team were monitored. \n \n \u201cI know nothing about this,\u201d said Rice. \u201cI was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to have an investigation of this,\u201d said show mainstay David Ignatius. \u201cWe\u2019ll begin to dig and learn what the facts were.

Strangely, Pelley stayed away from flinging the fiery insults which drew him much praise from the left.

However, Rice did not spread the information according to this former official, who insisted that there was nothing improper or political involved. \n \n On Fox News\u2019s Special Report, it was a whole different story as they led the program with Rice\u2019s unmasking efforts. \u201cThe surveillance of people close to President Trump, possibly the President himself, now has a name and a face attached to it.

That is now exposed as a lie, just like then she lied about what caused the Benghazi attack. \n \n All of that and more went unreported on the Big Three networks.

Photo: Agence France-Presse/Getty Images \n \n Well, what do you know. On the matter of who \u201cunmasked\u201d the names of Trump transition officials in U.S. intelligence reports, we now have one answer: Susan Rice, Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser. \n \n A U.S. intelligence official confirms to us the bombshell news, first reported Monday by Bloomberg, that Ms. Rice requested the name of at least one Trump transition official listed in an intelligence report in the months between Election Day and Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration. \n \n Ms. Rice received summaries of U.S. eavesdropping either when foreign officials were discussing the Trump team, or when foreign officials were conversing with a Trump transition member. The surveillance was legally authorized, but the identities of U.S. citizens are typically masked so they cannot be known outside intelligence circles. Ms. Rice asked for and learned the identity of the Trump official, whose name hasn\u2019t been publicly disclosed and our source declined to share. \n \n Potomac Watch Podcast \n \n Our source did confirm that Ms. Rice also examined dozens of other intelligence summaries that technically masked Trump official identities but were written in such a way as to make obvious who those officials were. This means that the masking was essentially meaningless. All this is highly unusual\u2014and troubling. Unmasking does occur, but it is typically done by intelligence or law-enforcement officials engaged in antiterror or espionage investigations. Ms. Rice would have had no obvious need to unmask Trump campaign officials other than political curiosity. \n \n We\u2019re told by a source who has seen the unmasked documents that they included political information about the Trump transition team\u2019s meetings and policy intentions. We are also told that none of these documents had anything to do with Russia or the FBI investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. While we don't know if Ms. Rice requested these dozens of reports, we are told that they were only distributed to a select group of recipients\u2014conveniently including Ms. Rice. \n \n All of this helps to explain the actions in the last week of House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, the one official in Washington who seems interested in pursuing the evidence of politicized surveillance. Mr. Nunes was roundly criticized by Democrats and the media last week for publicly revealing at least one instance of Obama White House unmasking, albeit without disclosing any names. \n \n Now we know he is onto something. And we know that Mr. Nunes had to go to the White House to verify his information because the records containing Ms. Rice\u2019s unmasking request are held at the National Security Council. \n \n Where are the civil libertarians when you really need them? These columns support broad surveillance powers for national security, but executive officials need to be accountable if those powers are abused. If congressional oversight of U.S. intelligence operations is going to be worth the name, then it should include the unmasking of a political opponent by a senior official in the White House. \n \n Democrats certainly raised a fuss during the Bush years and after Edward Snowden kicked off the debate about \u201cmetadata,\u201d which are merely telephone numbers without names. Oregon Senator Ron Wyden went so far as to introduce a bill in 2013 to strengthen the ban on \u201creverse targeting\u201d\u2014in which intelligence agencies surveil foreigners but with the goal of capturing U.S. citizen communications. \n \n Yet now that there\u2019s evidence that the Obama Administration may have unmasked Trump officials, Democrats couldn\u2019t care less. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on House Intelligence, has spent the past week denouncing Mr. Nunes for revealing that a name was unmasked and for having sources at the White House. But he hasn\u2019t raised a peep about the unmasking itself or who was behind it. \n \n The news about Ms. Rice\u2019s unmasking role raises a host of questions for the Senate and House intelligence committees to pursue. What specific surveillance information did Ms. Rice seek and why? Was this information related to President Obama\u2019s decision in January to make it possible for raw intelligence to be widely disbursed throughout the government? Was this surveillance of Trump officials \u201cincidental\u201d collection gathered while listening to a foreigner, or were some Trump officials directly targeted, or \u201creverse targeted\u201d? \n \n We were unable to locate Ms. Rice Monday to ask for comment, and she hasn\u2019t addressed the unmasking as far as we know. But asked last month on the \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d that Trump officials might have been surveilled, she said, \u201cI know nothing about this\u201d and \u201cI was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that account today.\u201d She certainly deserves her turn under oath on Capitol Hill. \n \n None of this should deter investigators from looking into the Trump-Russia connection. By all means follow that evidence where it leads. But the media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Former Obama national security adviser Susan Rice is back in the news again, this time regarding President Trump's wiretapping allegations. On the right, she is being accused of abusing her power while in office to \"unmask,\" for political advantage, the names of Trump associates caught up in intelligence surveillance. Trump critics, meanwhile, say the story doesn't amount to much and accuse the White House of trying to divert attention from the president's wiretapping allegations. A look at coverage: A key story comes from Eli Lake at Bloomberg News. He reported Monday that Rice requested the identities of Trump transition officials who were mentioned, but not named, in US intelligence reports. Those reports were mostly summaries of monitored conversations between foreign officials talking about the Trump transition, but sometimes between Trump associates and foreign officials. (The National Security Council logs of Rice's requests are apparently what Rep. Devin Nunes went to the White House to view.) Lake's piece raises questions about why Rice wanted those names revealed\u2014she didn't respond to the story\u2014but he also notes that her requests \"were likely within the law.\" He adds that the story doesn't \"vindicate\" Trump's unsupported accusation that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower. Adam Housley of Fox News also reported on Rice's requests, and his appearance on the network prompted Trump himself to weigh in via tweet: \"Such amazing reporting on unmasking and the crooked scheme against us by @foxandfriends. 'Spied on before nomination.' The real story.\" A post at Slate notes that Trump associates are under FBI investigation over allegedly improper communications with Russians, \"so there may well have been urgent, legal reasons for Rice to have wanted information about the relationships between specific Trump-related figures and foreign individuals.\" But the editorial page at the Wall Street Journal accuses the media and Democrats of hypocrisy. It wants any Trump-Russia ties investigated, but complains that the \"media have been running like wildebeest after that story while ignoring how the Obama Administration might have abused domestic surveillance for its political purposes. Americans deserve to know the truth about both.\" On CNN, Don Lemon accused the \"right-wing media\" of helping the White House try to divert attention from the controversy over Trump's wiretapping claims, adding that his show will not \"aid and abet people who are trying to misinform you, the American people, by creating a diversion,\" he said, per Mediaite. The conservative NewsBusters blog accused ABC, NBC, and CBS of covering up the story by failing to report on the \"massive revelation\" Monday in their evening broadcasts. On MSNBC Tuesday morning, frequent Trump critic Joe Scarborough blasted the New York Times for not having the story on its front page. \"What is Susan Rice unmasking names for and spreading them across the government,\" he asked on Morning Joe, per Mediaite. But the Times story on the subject (inside the paper) generally downplayed the significance of Rice's requests: \"Former national security officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, described the requests as normal and said they were justified by the need for the president\u2019s top security adviser to understand the context of reports sent to her by the nation\u2019s intelligence agencies.\"",

The president warned that the forces of globalization have exposed \"deep fault lines\" across the globe, calling for a \"course correction\" to ensure that nations and their peoples don't... (Associated Press) \n \n UNITED NATIONS (AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama conceded Tuesday that the United States and other world powers have limited ability to solve the most profound challenges facing the world, while calling for a \"course correction\" for globalization to ensure that nations don't retreat into a more sharply divided world. \n \n Obama, in his final speech to the U.N. General Assembly, acknowledged that the extremist and sectarian violence wreaking havoc in the Middle East and elsewhere \"will not be quickly reversed.\" Still, he stuck faithfully to his insistence that diplomatic efforts and not military solutions are the key to resolving Syria's civil war and other conflicts. \n \n \"If we are honest, we know that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to co-exist for long,\" Obama said. \"Until basic questions are answered about how communities co-exist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn. Countless human beings will suffer.\" \n \n In a less-than-subtle jab at Donald Trump, the Republican running to replace him, Obama said, \"The world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent (extremism) from affecting our own societies.\" \n \n The president was unabashed in his critique of Russia as he laid out his diagnosis of the world's ills. Obama's longstanding differences with Russian President Vladimir Putin over his actions in Ukraine have accompanied intense disagreement over Syria's future and a series of failed attempts by Russia and the U.S. to resolve the civil war there together. \n \n \"In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force,\" Obama said. \n \n The tough talk about Russia illustrated how little progress has been made in reconciling the diverging interests among the two powers that has allowed the Syria crisis to continue to fester. A year ago, Obama stood at the same podium and declared anew that Syrian President Bashar Assad must leave power, while Putin gave a dueling speech warning it would be a mistake to abandon Assad. \n \n In the year since, Moscow's leverage in the conflict has strengthened significantly. Russia's military intervention in Syria has helped bolster Assad's standing without pulling it into the military \"quagmire\" that Obama had predicted. \n \n Obama sought to use his last appearance before the global body to define how his leadership had put the world on a better trajectory over the last eight years. At the heart of that approach, Obama said, is the notion that the biggest conflicts are best solved when nations cooperate rather than tackle them individually. \n \n It's a theme that Democrat Hillary Clinton has put at the forefront of her campaign for president, casting herself as the natural continuation of Obama's legacy. In another apparent reference to Trump, Obama bemoaned how terrorist networks had spread their ideology on social media, spurring anger toward \"innocent immigrants and Muslims.\" \n \n Obama lamented that the world has become safer and more prosperous at the same time that nations are struggling with a devastating refugee crisis, terrorism and a breakdown in basic order in the Middle East. He said governing had become more difficult as people lose faith in public institutions and tensions among nations spiral out of control more rapidly. \n \n \"This is the paradox that defines the world today,\" Obama said. \"We must go forward, and not backward.\" \n \n The president cited his administration's outreach to former adversaries Cuba and Myanmar as key examples of progress, along with global cooperation to cut emissions blamed for global warming.

Add Interest \n \n \"Today a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,\" Obama warned, without naming the Republican presidential nominee. \n \n Obama further cautioning against \"the same forces of global integration\" that have made democracies interdependent while exposing \"deep fault lines in the existing international order\" like gaps between the rich and poor created by capitalism throughout the world. \n \n He made two other references to the ineffectiveness of walls in stopping global forces, quipping in an apparent reference to the Zika virus that \"mosquitoes don't respect walls\" and saying of terrorism that \"the world is simply too small to be able to build a wall and stop it from affecting our own societies.\" \n \n Though he never directly addressed the U.S. presidential election, Obama's message for the General Assembly was in many ways applicable to the impulses raging in the race, citing \"a contest between authoritarianism and democracy right now\" and an appeal for a top-down \"strongman model.\" \n \n Obama rejected such tendencies. \"History shows that strongmen are then left with two paths,\" he said. \"Permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war.\" \n \n Speaking about the big picture, the Obama recounted the progress made during his presidency, on issues such as the global financial crisis, international terrorism and re-establishing relations with Cuba. \n \n \"This is important work,\" he stressed. \"It has made a real difference in the lives of our people, and it could not have happened had we not worked together.\" \n \n Obama said nations \"can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration\" or \"retreat into a world sharply divided and ultimately in conflict along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion.\" \n \n \"I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward and not backward,\" he said, although he added that doing so would require nations of the world to \"acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.\" \n \n \"The answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration,\" Obama said. \"Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared and that the disruptions \u2014 economic, political and cultural \u2014 that are caused by integration are squarely addressed.\" \n \n \n \n Obama demanded that democracies of the world \"speak out forcefully\" for \"freedom and dignity.\" \n \n \"A world in which 1 percent of the economy controls the other 99 percent will never be stable,\" he said. \"These are the policies I've pursued in the United States, and with clear results\" \u2014 touting progress in job creation, cutting poverty, improving infrastructure and investing in childhood education. \n \n His speech came as fighting in Syria has resumed after the Syrian military declared Monday an end to the fragile cease-fire deal that was brokered between the U.S. and Russia just over a week ago. \n \n \"Together now we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home. We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering,\" Obama said. \"There's a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing, but many nations \u2014 particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography \u2014 that can do more to offer a hand.\" \n \n In the same month that North Korea conducted its second nuclear test of the year, Obama highlighted the benefits of free markets over markets resisting influence from globalization. \n \n \"We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box, nor can we look to failed models of the past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market distorting subsidies, overreliance on national resources instead of innovation, these approaches will make us poor collectively, and they're more likely to lead to conflict,\" he said. \n \n \"And the stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that central plan to control the economy is a dead end,\" Obama said. ||||| Obama warns against strongman governments \n \n Making his case against nationalistic and anti-immigration movements that have grown both in the U.S. and around the globe, President Barack Obama told the United Nations general assembly Tuesday that \u201ctoday, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.\u201d \n \n Obama\u2019s remark appeared to be an allusion to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has campaigned hard against the president\u2019s record and has pledged to build a wall along America\u2019s southern border with Mexico. In his final address as president before the United Nations general assembly, Obama was critical of the isolationist movement that Trump has championed in the U.S. and others have pushed abroad. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n \u201cAs these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward, both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest,\u201d Obama said after discussing economic inequality and other international issues. \u201cReligious fundamentalism, the politics of ethnicity or tribe or sect, aggressive nationalism, a crude populism, sometimes from the far left but more often from the far right, which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination. We cannot dismiss these visions. They are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens. \u201d \n \n \u201cToday, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,\u201d the president continued. \u201cSo the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared.\u201d \n \n The president led his speech with a celebration of global accomplishments to which the U.S. has been party during his administration, listing the reduction of terrorists\u2019 safe havens, the landmark nuclear agreement with Iran and the resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba as successes. \n \n But Obama also listed global problems like the flow of refugees, continued financial disruptions, and a lack of basic order and security in the Middle East. The president urged the international community \u201cthat we must go forwards and not backwards,\u201d offering a defense of Western values as the best path forward for global growth and success. \n \n \u201cI believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI make this argument not based on theory or ideology but on facts.\u201d \n \n In making that case, Obama warned against strongman governments and oppressive tactics like media suppression. He said such strategies are stifling for economies hungry for information and ultimately lead to further crackdowns or the scapegoating of foreign enemies that can lead to war. \n \n Speaking specifically of the Middle East, Obama called for the recognition of a \u201ccommon humanity\u201d that would serve as a stepping stone toward resolving the various conflicts in the region. Again attacking isolationism, Obama said the rest of the world cannot turn its back on conflict in the Middle East in the hope that violence will be contained to the region. \n \n \u201cUntil basic questions are answered about how communities coexist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer, most of all in that region, but extremism will continue to be exported overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies.\u201d ||||| UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Both sides would benefit if Israel recognized it cannot permanently occupy Palestinian land and if Palestinians rejected incitement and recognized Israel\u2019s legitimacy, U.S. President Barack Obama told the United Nations on Tuesday. \n \n Obama\u2019s efforts to bring about an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement have failed over the nearly eight years he has been in the White House, with the latest push by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry collapsing in 2014. \n \n U.S. officials have held out the possibility Obama could lay out the rough outlines of a deal - \u201cparameters\u201d in diplomatic parlance - after the Nov. 8 presidential election and before he leaves office in January, but many analysts doubt this would have much effect. \n \n \u201cSurely Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel ...(and if) Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land,\u201d Obama said. \n \n Related Coverage Obama to raise concerns about settlements with Netanyahu: White House \n \n Speaking at the General Assembly annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations for the last time as president, Obama also said Russia was trying to recover \u201clost glory\u201d through force. \n \n He warned Russia that if it \u201ccontinues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home, it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time, but over time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure.\u201d \n \n Russia annexed Ukraine\u2019s Crimean peninsula in 2014 after months of protests in Kiev ousted pro-Moscow Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. \n \n On the international dispute over the South China Sea, Obama said: \u201cA peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability then the militarization of a few rocks and reefs.\u201d \n \n Slideshow (23 Images) \n \n China claims almost all of the South China Sea, through which ships carrying about $5 trillion in trade pass every year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims in the sea, which is also believed to be rich in energy resources and fish stocks. \n \n In July, an arbitration court in The Hague said China\u2019s claims to the waterway were invalid, in a case was brought by the Philippines. Beijing has refused to recognize the ruling. ||||| President Obama strongly defended a globalized, interconnected world in his final speech at the United Nations on Tuesday, arguing that open markets, capitalism and democracy should remain the guiding forces of the international order. \n \n Obama slammed what he described as \"aggressive nationalism\" and \"crude populism\" of populist leaders who are wary of internationalism growing in influence around the world. Obama did not directly mention the British vote to leave the European Union or the rise of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, but his speech was obviously aimed at pushing back against such developments, which he has strongly opposed. \n \n \"A nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself,\" Obama said. \n \n Related: Obama to Highlight Foreign Policy Accomplishments at U.N. \n \n Later in the speech, Obama noted, \"the world is too small for us to simply build a wall.\" \n \n It was a speech that sought to highlight the significant progress over the course of Obama's presidency on such issues as climate change, economic security and advocating for democratic freedoms \u2014 as he seeks to cement his legacy. \n \n \"The integration of our global economy has made life better for billions of our women and children,\" he said, adding \"our international order has been so successful we take it as a given that great powers no longer fight wars.\" \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Google Plus \n \n Embed In Final U.N. Speech, Obama Stresses Universal Liberty and Equality 1:37 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n It was also a speech that underscored that, despite the progress, challenges remain as the world grapples with the rise of ISIS and eyes North Korea's nuclear ambitions. \n \n Obama also specifically spoke out against what he called a \"strong man\" leadership model, arguing instead for nations with democratic governments and strong independent news institutions. He seemed to contrast with the leadership approaches of both Trump and Vladimir Putin. \n \n \"Those of use who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully,\" he said adding, \"I believe in a liberal political order.\" \n \n The president acknowledged the growing gap between the rich and poor, particularly in the U.S. He argued policies such as expanding labor unions and increasing education would help address these disparities. \n \n \"The answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration,\" Obama said. \"We have to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared.\" \n \n Obama arrived in office in 2009 set on winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. But his speech illustrated how the world has changed in the last eight years. \n \n While U.S. troops remain in both nations, the president seemed as worried about economics and culture as military issues. \n \n \"We are seeing the same forces of global integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines in the existing international order,\" the president said. \n \n President Obama arrives at the United Nations to address the General Assembly on Sept. 20. NBC News \n \n But he argued, \"we must reject any forms of fundamentalism or racism or a belief in ethnic superiority.\" \n \n Obama also used the speech to list what he views as his signature achievements on foreign policy: normalizing relations with Cuba, reaching a nuclear agreement with Iran, helping push Myanmar towards democracy, agreeing with nations around the world on goals to reduce emissions and fight climate change. \n \n The president addressed some of the issues that are viewed as shortcomings of his foreign policy approach. \n \n He argued diplomacy was the only way to end the civil war in Syria. He called for greater international cooperation to fight ISIS. \n \n Obama recently pledged that the U.S. would accept 110,000 refugees, up from about 85,000 this year. The administration recently announced the U.S. had reached its goal of admitting 10,000 refugees from Syria this year. \n \n Children play at the yard of an abandoned school used by volunteers for hosting families of refugees from Syria and Afghanistan in Athens on June 27, 2016. ARIS MESSINIS / AFP - Getty Images \n \n The U.S. remains far behind the pace of nations like Germany in accepting refugees. \n \n But in increasing the number of refugees now, the Obama administration is both trying to address a growing humanitarian crisis, particularly in Syria but also reject the anti-Muslim, anti-refugee rhetoric of Trump. \n \n In his 2008 campaign, Obama promised to rebuild American relations with countries abroad who had opposed the Iraq War and felt the Bush administration too often acted internationally without consulting other nations. In a September 2009 address to the United Nations General Assembly, Obama promised a \"a new era of engagement based on mutual interest and mutual respect.\" \n \n Related: Trump's and Obama's Views on Globalization Reflect Broader Gap \n \n In 2008, the Pew Research Center asked people in 24 countries around the world if they had could count on President George W. Bush to do the right thing on foreign affairs issues. Majorities in only three of the 24 countries expressed confidence in Bush. \n \n Last year, Pew asked a similar question. In 32 of the 40 countries Pew surveyed, a majority of the people had confidence in Obama's global leadership. \n \n But Obama's 2009 speech also shows some goals he did not accomplish. \n \n The president has not been able to convince Republicans in Congress to support the closing of the military prison at Guantanamo Bay or made much progress in achieving a permanent solution to the tensions between the Palestinians and the Israelis. \n \n A Navy guard patrols Camp Delta's detainee recreation yard during the early morning at Guantanamo Bay naval base in a July 7, 2010 handout. President Barack Obama urged lawmakers on Tuesday to give his plan to close the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, a \"fair hearing\" and said he did not want to pass the issue to his successor when he leaves the White House next year. R. Holzworth/US Army / Reuters \n \n Even on issues like fighting climate change and reducing the nuclear weapons stockpiles around the world, Obama's achievements have been mixed. \n \n Obama successfully reached an agreement with Iran to reduce its nuclear program, but North Korea appears to have increased its nuclear capacity over the last 8 years. \n \n Al Qaeda has been weakened, as Obama hoped for in 2009, but ISIS has emerged as a major threat to commit terrorist acts across the globe. \n \n Obama in 2009 argued that \"power is no longer a zero-sum game\" and suggested the time was over for \"alignments of nations rooted in the cleavages of a long-gone Cold War.\" But Russian president Vladimir Putin appears to view international relations in this model Obama criticized and has taken actions in the Ukraine and Iran that the American president has opposed but could not prevent.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 President Obama addressed the United Nations as president for the final time on Tuesday with a speech that urged world leaders make a \"course correction\" and be more open to refugees and less authoritarian. And he seemed to be take a shot, more than once, at Donald Trump's vision of a big, beautiful wall. Some lines from accounts by the AP, Politico, Reuters, ABC News and NBC News: \"Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.\" \u201cThe world is simply too small to be able to build a wall and stop it from affecting our own societies.\u201d He also said, apparently in reference to Zika, that \"mosquitoes don't respect walls.\" \"We must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions, from their religion, their ethnicity, from their sense of nationhood. But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group.\" \"In countries held together by borders drawn by colonial powers with ethnic enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear to be a zero sum game. And so given the difficulty in forging true democracy in the face of these pressures, it's no surprise that some argue the future favors the strongman. A top-down model rather than strong democratic institutions. But I believe this thinking is wrong.\" \"History shows that strongmen are then left with two paths. Permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war.\" \"In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force.\" \"Surely Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel ...(and if) Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land.\" Watch a video of the speech via USA Today.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 President Obama conceded Tuesday that the United States and other world powers have limited ability to solve the most profound challenges facing the world, while calling for a \"course correction\" for globalization to ensure that nations don't retreat into a more sharply divided world. Obama, in his final speech to the UN General Assembly, acknowledged that the extremist and sectarian violence wreaking havoc in the Middle East and elsewhere \"will not be quickly reversed,\" reports USA Today. Still, he stuck faithfully to his insistence that diplomatic efforts and not military solutions are the key to resolving Syria's civil war and other conflicts. \"If we are honest, we know that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to co-exist for long,\" Obama said. \"Until basic questions are answered about how communities co-exist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn. Countless human beings will suffer.\" In a less-than-subtle jab at Donald Trump, the Republican running to replace him, Obama said, \"The world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent (extremism) from affecting our own societies.\" Obama sought to use his last appearance before the global body to define how his leadership had put the world on a better trajectory over the last eight years. At the heart of that approach, he said, is the notion that the biggest conflicts are best solved when nations cooperate rather than tackle them individually. In another apparent reference to Trump, Obama bemoaned how terrorist networks had spread their ideology on social media, spurring anger toward \"innocent immigrants and Muslims.\"",

(Associated Press) \n \n In this Monday, Aug. 18, 2014 photo, Japanese instant noodle lover Miyuki Ogata, a 33-year-old director for films and TV shows, eats an instant cup noodle in Tokyo. Instant noodles are a godsend for Ogata... (Associated Press) \n \n \"There's no way any study is going to stop me from eating this,\" says Kim, his red face beaded with sweat as he adds hot water to his noodles in a Seoul convenience store. His mouth waters, wooden chopsticks poised above the softening strands, his glasses fogged by steam. At last, he spears a slippery heap, lets forth a mighty, noodle-cooling blast of air and starts slurping. \n \n \"This is the best moment \u2014 the first bite,\" Kim, a freelance film editor who indulges about five times a week, says between gulps. \"The taste, the smell, the chewiness \u2014 it's just perfect.\" \n \n Instant noodles carry a broke college student aura in America, but they are an essential, even passionate, part of life for many in South Korea and across Asia. Hence the emotional heartburn caused by a Baylor Heart and Vascular Hospital study in the United States that linked instant noodles consumption by South Koreans to some risks for heart disease. \n \n The study has provoked feelings of wounded pride, mild guilt, stubborn resistance, even nationalism among South Koreans, who eat more instant noodles per capita than anyone in the world. Many of those interviewed vowed, like Kim, not to quit. Other noodle lovers offered up techniques they swore kept them healthy: taking Omega-3, adding vegetables, using less seasoning, avoiding the soup. Some dismissed the study because the hospital involved is based in cheeseburger-gobbling America. \n \n The heated reaction is partly explained by the omnipresence here of instant noodles, which, for South Koreans, usually mean the spicy, salty \"ramyeon\" that costs less than a dollar a package. Individually-wrapped disposable bowls and cups are everywhere: Internet cafes, libraries, trains, ice-skating rinks. Even at the halfway point of a trail snaking up South Korea's highest mountain, hikers can refresh themselves with cup noodles. \n \n Elderly South Koreans often feel deep nostalgia for instant noodles, which entered the local market in the 1960s as the country began clawing its way out of the poverty and destruction of the Korean War into what's now Asia's fourth-biggest economy. Many vividly remember their first taste of the once-exotic treat, and hard-drinking South Koreans consider instant noodles an ideal remedy for aching, alcohol-laden bellies and subsequent hangovers. \n \n Some people won't leave the country without them, worried they'll have to eat inferior noodles abroad. What could be better at relieving homesickness than a salty shot of ramyeon? \n \n \"Ramyeon is like kimchi to Koreans,\" says Ko Dong-ryun, 36, an engineer from Seoul, referring to the spicy, fermented vegetable dish that graces most Korean meals. \"The smell and taste create an instant sense of home.\" \n \n Ko fills half his luggage with instant noodles for his international business travels, a lesson he learned after assuming on his first trip that three packages would suffice for six days. \"Man, was I wrong. Since then, I always make sure I pack enough.\" \n \n The U.S. study was based on South Korean surveys from 2007-2009 of more than 10,700 adults aged 19-64, about half of them women. It found that people who ate a diet rich in meat, soda and fried and fast foods, including instant noodles, were associated with an increase in abdominal obesity and LDL, or \"bad,\" cholesterol. Eating instant noodles more than twice a week was associated with a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome, another heart risk factor, in women but not in men. \n \n The study raises important questions, but can't prove that instant noodles are to blame rather than the overall diets of people who eat lots of them, cautions Alice Lichtenstein, director of the cardiovascular nutrition lab at Tufts University in Boston. \n \n \"What's jumping out is the sodium (intake) is higher in those who are consuming ramen noodles,\" she says. \"What we don't know is whether it's coming from the ramen noodles or what they are consuming with the ramen noodles.\" \n \n There's certainly a lot of sodium in those little cups. A serving of the top-selling instant ramyeon provides more than 90 percent of South Korea's recommended daily sodium intake. \n \n Still, it's tough to expect much nutrition from a meal that costs around 80 cents, says Choi Yong-min, 44, marketing director for Paldo, a South Korean food company. \"I can't say it's good for your health, but it is produced safely.\" \n \n By value, instant noodles were the top-selling manufactured food in South Korea in 2012, the most recent year figures are available, with about 1.85 trillion won ($1.8 billion) worth sold, according to South Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. \n \n China is the world's largest instant noodle market, according to the World Instant Noodles Association, although its per capita consumption pales next to South Korea's. The food is often a low-end option for Chinese people short of money, time or cooking facilities. \n \n Japan, considered the spiritual home of instant noodles, boasts a dazzling array. Masaya \"Instant\" Oyama, 55, who says he eats more than 400 packages of instant noodles a year, rattles off a sampling: Hello Kitty instant noodles, polar bear instant noodles developed by a zoo, black squid ink instant noodles. \n \n In Tokyo, 33-year-old Miyuki Ogata considers instant noodles a godsend because of her busy schedule and contempt for cooking. They also bring her back to the days when she was a poor student learning to become a filmmaker, and would buy two cup noodles at the 100 yen shop. Every time she eats a cup now, she is celebrating what she calls \"that eternal hungry spirit.\" \n \n In South Korea, it's all about speed, cost and flavor. \n \n Thousands of convenience stores have corners devoted to noodles: Tear off the top, add hot water from a dispenser, wait a couple minutes and it's ready to eat, often at a nearby counter. \n \n Some even skip the water, pounding on the package to break up the dry noodles, adding the seasoning, then shaking everything up. \n \n \"It's toasty, chewy, much better than most other snacks out there,\" Byon Sarah, 28, who owns a consulting company, says of a technique she discovered in middle school. \"And the seasoning is so addictive \u2014 sweet, salty and spicy.\" \n \n Cheap electric pots that boil water for instant noodles in one minute are popular with single people. Making an \"instant\" meal even faster, however, isn't always appreciated. \n \n At the comic book store she runs in Seoul, Lim Eun-jung, 42, says she noticed a lot more belly fat about six months after she installed a fast-cooking instant noodle machine for customers. \n \n \"It's obvious that it's not good for my body,\" Lim says. \"But I'm lazy, and ramyeon is the perfect fast food for lazy people.\" \n \n ___ \n \n AP journalists Youkyung Lee in Seoul, Yuri Kageyama in Tokyo, Didi Tang and Zhang Weiqun in Beijing, and AP Food Editor J.M.

It is unclear whether a higher intake of instant noodles is associated with cardiometabolic risk independent of overall dietary patterns. We therefore investigated the association using the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV 2007\u20132009, a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of the Korean population with a clustered, multistage, stratified, and rolling sampling design. A total of 10,711 adults (54.5% women) 19\u201364 y of age were analyzed, with adjustment for sampling design complexity. Diet was assessed by using a 63-item food-frequency questionnaire. We identified 2 major dietary patterns with the use of principal components analysis: the \u201ctraditional dietary pattern\u201d (TP), rich in rice, fish, vegetables, fruit, and potatoes, and the \u201cmeat and fast-food pattern\u201d (MP), with less rice intake but rich in meat, soda, fried food, and fast food including instant noodles. The highest MP quintile was associated with increased prevalence of abdominal obesity (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.90), LDL cholesterol \u2265130 mg/dL (1.3 g/L) (OR: 1.57, 95% CI 1.26, 1.95), decreased prevalence of low HDL cholesterol (OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.80), and high triglycerides [\u2265150 mg/dL (1.5 g/L); OR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.93]. The highest quintile for the TP was associated with decreased prevalence of elevated blood pressure (OR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59, 0.90) and marginally lower trends for abdominal obesity (OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.98; P-trend = 0.06), but neither of the dietary patterns was associated with prevalence of metabolic syndrome. The consumption of instant noodles \u22652 times/wk was associated with a higher prevalence of metabolic syndrome (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.55) in women but not in men (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.58, 1.49; P-interaction = 0.04). The 2 major dietary patterns were associated with distinct cardiometabolic risk factors. The consumption of instant noodles was associated with increased prevalence of metabolic syndrome in women, independent of major dietary patterns.",

A new American study of South Korea's ramen consumption examined the diets of 10,700 people aged 19 to 64. They found both healthy (fish and rice) and unhealthy (meat and fast food) diet trends, but neither was linked to metabolic syndrome and ultimately heart disease, the New York Times explains. When instant noodles were thrown in the mix, researchers saw trouble. Women who ate a cup of them more than twice a week saw a 68% jump in cardiometabolic syndrome. It didn't matter what else they ate. Some South Koreans are a little steamed\u2014and defensive\u2014about the study's findings. After all, South Koreans eat more ramen than anyone else; the sodium-rich 80-cent cup is found everywhere there, from comic book stores to libraries and train stations. One man tells the AP, while guzzling ramen: \"There's no way any study is going to stop me from eating this.\" Love for the instant noodle spans generations\u2014it reminds the elderly of post-Korean War recovery and for the young and busy, it's quick and cheap.

But the study's lead author tells the AP, \"There's no way any study is going to stop me from eating this.\" Instant noodles are a staple in South Korea, where consumption is the highest in the world, and the study's lead author says the findings should be taken with a grain of salt.

Bonds, 19, said the chairs belonged to the Fairfax County Park Authority, where he worked, according to police. Johns said they were hers. \n \n Tensions had been simmering all Saturday night between Bonds and the guests at a wedding reception catered by Johns at hall in the park, and when bickering over the chairs started, as police described events Sunday, Bonds lashed out. \n \n In little time, a trivial matter escalated into the stabbing death of a woman who many who knew her say was an up-and-coming caterer and chef. \n \n Bonds, of Clifton, Md., has been charged with second-degree murder, accused of stabbing to death Johns, the 35-year-old owner of the Chef Tyonne catering company after their argument in Ellanor C. Lawrence Park in Chantilly, Fairfax County police said. \n \n Kempton A. Bonds, 19, of Clifton, Md., has been charged with second-degree murder for allegedly stabbing a caterer during what police said was an argument over folding chairs at a wedding Saturday. (Fairfax County Police) \n \n As Johns packed up folding chairs, witnesses say, Bonds said they were park property, police spokeswoman Monica Meeks said. Within minutes of that argument, police said, Bonds pulled out a pocketknife and stabbed Johns in the upper body. \n \n Police arrived at the park on Walney Road in Chantilly at approximately 10:50 p.m. and found Johns, of the District, stabbed. She died at a local hospital. \n \n Earlier Saturday evening, county officials said, Bonds had placed a call to police after becoming aggravated by the behavior of the wedding guests. \n \n Seymone Spence, a bartender working at the reception with the Chef Tyonne company and also Johns\u2019s good friend, said Bonds cut off electrical power at the junction box during the reception, abruptly halting the music and festivities for a crowd of 80. The bride and groom had yet to share their first dance. \n \n \u201cThe young lady who was facilitating the cutting of the cake said \u2018I don\u2019t have a mic. The kid cut off the power, so if you all can hear me, we\u2019re about to cut the cake,\u2019 \u201d Spence said. \n \n Bonds called police at 9:24 p.m. to file a complaint of disorderly conduct and excessive noise, authorities said at a Sunday afternoon news conference. \n \n But when police arrived, they said the incident \u2014 logged as a domestic dispute \u2014 had been resolved. The park authority said that because the wedding had started late in the day, the guests were allowed to stay on the premises later than the usual closing. \n \n The argument over the chairs erupted later, police said. \n \n Calls to relatives of Bonds seeking an interview Sunday were not returned. \n \n He is being held without bond and has been fired by the park authority pending the outcome of the investigation. Bonds has worked there since 2015. \n \n As facilities attendant, he handled events such as weddings, birthday parties and baby showers. The park authority said it had never received a complaint about his conduct. \n \n \u201cWe are shocked,\u201d said Judy Pedersen, spokeswoman for the park authority. \u201cIt\u2019s a tragic event. We believe that our many employees . . . are law abiding, honest, hard-working people. This is just shocking, but we\u2019re anxious to hear all of the facts.\u201d \n \n Pedersen expressed condolences to Johns\u2019s family. \n \n Throughout Saturday night, Spence said, Bonds\u2019s bizarre conduct was noticeable to guests. \n \n \u201cHe was very, very pensive and tight,\u201d she said. \u201cHe never once cracked a smile \u2014 not once. It was scary.\u201d \n \n A friend, Nick Martin, 19, said Bonds attends Northern Virginia Community College. He planned to transfer to Virginia Commonwealth University this fall and major in communications, Martin said of Bonds. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s all so surreal,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s one of my good friends and it never seemed like he could even hurt a fly. I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019d do something like this.\u201d \n \n Martin said Bonds called him Saturday while the wedding reception was taking place and said guests were getting upset about the regulations that Bonds said he had to enforce. Bonds mentioned a ban on not allowing decorations to be hung on the walls, Martin said. \n \n Mikaela Robinson, a sous chef for the catering company, was not at Saturday\u2019s event but said Sunday she had fond memories of working alongside Johns. \n \n \u201cShe was full of life. Loving and caring,\u201d she said. \u201cI was her sous chef, so she was always hard on me because she wanted me to be better than her, but there was no way I would be and never will be.\u201d \n \n Johns attended Empowerment Liberation Cathedral in Silver Spring. Bishop Allyson Abrams remembered her as a \u201ckindhearted, very loving spirit.\u201d \n \n \u201cI just hope that justice will prevail,\u201d she said. \n \n Johns\u2019s cousin, Brandon Thompson, 30, of Richmond , said Johns was a rising chef who \u201ctook the road less traveled.\u201d They often laughed, especially reflecting on shared childhood memories. \n \n Spence said she cherished Johns for her dominant personality and enterprising spirit. \n \n And, she said, she served a dazzling last meal: steaming-hot salmon and jerk chicken, complemented by macaroni and cheese and rice pilaf, well-plated and handed out to dozens. \n \n \u201cShe\u2019s a professional,\u201d Spence said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t haphazard. Nothing that she did was haphazard. It was all well thought of . . . everything was beautiful.\u201d \n \n Julie Tate contributed to this report. ||||| Wedding Caterer Stabbed to Death After Reception in Fairfax Co. \n \n A wedding caterer was stabbed to death following a wedding reception in Chantilly, Va. on Saturday.

    "document": "\u201cSausage Party\u201d scored at the box office this weekend, debuting to a meaty $33.6 million and providing a much-needed win for struggling Sony Pictures. In a summer dominated by spinoffs and reboots, the story of a gang of grocery items grappling with the dangers of the kitchen was an antidote to sequelitis and a reminder of the power of original ideas. \n \n \u201cIt was the something different that adult audiences have been craving,\u201d said Jeff Bock, an analyst with Exhibitor Relations. \u201cWhen comedy pushes the envelope, that\u2019s when it works best.\u201d \n \n In the case of \u201cSausage Party,\u201d which liberally deploys sex jokes and four-letter words, it\u2019s a foul-mouthed affair that more than earns its R rating. The $19 million animated comedy was also backed by Annapurna Pictures, the maker of \u201cThe Master\u201d and \u201cAmerican Hustle.\u201d Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Edward Norton, Jonah Hill and Bill Hader are among the vocal cast members. The studio released \u201cSausage Party\u201d in 3,103 locations, and it now holds the record for the largest August opening ever for an animated film. \n \n \u201cWhen you have something so fresh, it just stands out to audiences,\u201d said Rory Bruer, Sony\u2019s distribution chief. \u201cPeople were blown away by the movie. It\u2019s outrageous, off-the-wall fun.\u201d \n \n Related \u2018Suicide Squad\u2019 Is a Hit, But DC Needs to Start Making Better Movies \n \n It\u2019s good news for Sony, which has had a bruising period at the multiplexes. Flops such as \u201cGhostbusters,\u201d \u201cPride and Prejudice and Zombies\u201d and \u201cThe 5th Wave\u201d have outweighed hits such as \u201cThe Shallows\u201d and \u201cThe Angry Birds Movie.\u201d It gives Sony momentum as it tries to put its recent bad run behind it and prepares for a fall and winter that will bring the debuts of \u201cThe Magnificent Seven\u201d with Denzel Washington and \u201cPassengers\u201d with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. \n \n And then there are victories that feel more like defeats. \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d topped domestic charts with $43.8 million, bringing its stateside total to a hefty $222.9 million. However, that represented a punishing 67% slide in the superhero movie\u2019s second week business, nearly equaling \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\u2019s\u201d 69% sophomore plunge. It\u2019s a signal that the deplorable reviews are catching up with the film and is unwelcome news for Warner Bros., which is trying to launch an inter-connected series of cinematic adventures based on DC Comics characters, but is still struggling to make movies that people like, as well as attend. \n \n The weekend\u2019s other major new release, Disney\u2019s \u201cPete\u2019s Dragon,\u201d faltered, mustering roughly $21.6 million from 3,702 locations, despite scoring glowing reviews. The remake of the 1977 family film about a boy who befriends a dragon stars Robert Redford and Bryce Dallas Howard. \u201cPete\u2019s Dragon\u201d snagged third place on the charts. It cost $65 million to make, making its opening a disappointment. Still, Disney believes that it could ultimately make a profit when its foreign grosses are factored into the picture. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to come out of this having made money,\u201d said Dave Hollis, Disney\u2019s distribution chief. \u201cPeople who are coming out of the theater are just loving it and their advocacy is going to help us put together a nice, solid run.\u201d \n \n Coming in fourth, Universal\u2019s \u201cJason Bourne\u201d added $13.6 million to its haul, pushing its domestic total to $126.8 million. STX Entertainment\u2019s \u201cBad Moms\u201d rounded out the top five with $11.4 million. The raunchy comedy has been a breakout hit for the new studio, earning $71.5 million to date on a $20 million production budget, and holding well on a week-to-week basis despite the presence of several summer tentpoles. \n \n Paramount debuted \u201cFlorence Foster Jenkins,\u201d a comedy about an off-key opera singer and heiress (Meryl Streep) who rents out Carnegie Hall for a public performance, in 1,528 locations. The film did a muted $6.6 million worth of business, and appealed primarily to older audiences, with 97% of its opening weekend crowd clocking in over the age of 25. \n \n \u201cWord-of-mouth is definitely going to be our friend,\u201d said Megan Colligan, Paramount\u2019s president of worldwide distribution and marketing. She added that the studio is confident that Streep and possibly her co-star Hugh Grant could end up in the hunt for awards, something which could goose revenues. \n \n \u201cThis is very much in line with the Academy\u2019s sensibilities,\u201d said Colligan. \n \n In limited release, Bleecker Street launched the World War II thriller \u201cAnthropoid\u201d in 452 theaters, earning $1.2 million. \n \n CBS Films scored with \u201cHell or High Water,\u201d a bank heist picture that earned critical raves at the Cannes Film Festival. The thriller picked up an impressive $592,000 from 32 locations for a per screen average of $18,500. The studio partnered with Lionsgate on the distribution. It expects to keep expanding the film, which stars Chris Pine and Jeff Bridges, in the coming weeks. \n \n Total receipts were up nearly 15% from the year-ago period \u2014 a weekend that saw the release of \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d and \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d Analysts said that August has now become a hospitable launching ground for films such as \u201cSausage Party\u201d that deviate from Hollywood\u2019s current franchise mentality.

In particular, after following the infiltration of quackery in the form of \u201ccomplementary and alternative medicine\u201d (CAM), now more commonly known as \u201cintegrative medicine,\u201d because it integrates CAM with evidence-based medicine. Of course, in reality, what \u201cintegrative medicine\u201d really does is to integrate prescientific, pseudoscientific, and antiscientific quackery with real medicine, and that\u2019s what I mean. I thought I had seen it all in academic medical centers and medical schools: the faith healing that is reiki at National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated comprehensive cancer centers, acupuncture at more universities than I can recall, functional medicine and traditional Chinese medicine at at the Cleveland Clinic; naturopathy and therefore, whether the MDs in the integrative medicine departments know it or not, The One Quackery To Rule Them All, homeopathy, which is an integral part of naturopathy; and even Rudolf Steiner\u2019s ultimate woo, anthroposophic medicine at my damned alma mater! \n \n Yes, I thought I had seen it all, until I came across this Tweet by Tim Caulfield, an outspoken critic of CAM from our neighbors up north: \n \n \n \n \n \n And: \n \n Yes, you read that right. It\u2019s a flier for Pediatric Integrative Medicine Rounds at the University of Alberta\u2019s CARE Program for Integrative Health and Healing advertising a spoon bending workshop. No wonder most people thought it was a joke or some sort of satire. It wasn\u2019t; it even showed up on the CBC News website: \n \n The workshop is to be presented on June 28 by Anastasia Kutt, an Edmonton \u201cenergy healing therapist\u201d and \u201cregistered reiki master,\u201d according to her website. \u201cThis experiential workshop will teach a guided meditation/energy transfer technique which will have most participants bending cutlery using the power of their minds,\u201d the workshop description says. \u201cThis will not be a scientific evaluation of the process,\u201d the poster notes. \n \n It won\u2019t be a scientific evaluation of the process? Imagine my relief. Particularly hilarious is the part about typically \u201c75% of workshop participants can bend the spoon.\u201d Only 75%? \n \n Naturally, I wandered over to Anastasia Kutt\u2019s website, Luminous Tranquility, where I learned: \n \n Anastasia Kutt (click here for bio) is an energy healing therapist and workshop facilitator in Edmonton, Alberta. She is a Registered Reiki Master Teacher with the Canadian Reiki Association, and offers Reiki workshops at Healing Connections Wellness Center. She is one of 20 certified Trilotherapists in Canada, and also has extensive training in the Yuen Method of Energy Clearing. Please see Workshops for upcoming events and Treatments for information about treatments. \n \n Kutt appears not to be actually treating anyone, but rather making her living doing workshops on reiki and \u201cenergy medicine,\u201d including spoon bending workshops, and selling a guided meditation CD. So, obviously, someone at the Pediatric Integrative Medicine program at the University of Alberta must have hired Kutt to do this workshop. Just let that sink in. Whoever runs the Pediatric Integrative Medicine Rounds thought that it was a good idea to invite an \u201cenergy healer\u201d to demonstrate how to use the \u201cpower of the mind\u201d to bend a spoon! Ultimately, it was reported that the event was canceled, which just goes to show that shining the light of day on these excesses of quackademic medicine is the best disinfectant for \n \n At this point, it would be very easy to go on a fun (and hopefully funny) rant about just how bad things have gotten in quackademic medicine that anyone at an actual medical school would take the claims of spoon bending at face value. Very easy indeed. It would have been a hell of a lot of fun, too, which made it difficult for me to restrain myself. However, as I read over this sad story of credulity, I was reminded of something that happened a mere two weeks ago at the Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism (NECSS), when Scientific American journalist John Horgan gave a talk with the intentionally inflammatory title, Dear \u201cSkeptics,\u201d Bash Homeopathy and Bigfoot Less, Mammograms and War More: A science journalist takes a skeptical look at capital-S Skepticism, which he later posted on his Scientific American blog. It provoked a lot of reactions because it was so fractally wrong, including two responses from Steve Novella, Daniel Loxton, Jerry Coyne, and, of course, yours truly. \n \n Basically, Horgan\u2019s criticism of skepticism boiled down to an accusation that we don\u2019t take on the \u201chard\u201d targets, preferring instead to go after \u201ceasy\u201d targets like Bigfoot, homeopathy, astrology, and the like. While there is a grain of truth in that characterization, overall Horgan\u2019s whine came across as the fallacy of relative privation or, as I like to put it, \u201cYou should stop caring about what you care about and care about what I care about instead because it\u2019s so much more important than what you care about.\u201d Part of that characterization was to disparage \u201cbigfoot skeptics.\u201d Do you see where I\u2019m going with this? \n \n One of the most basic issues of skepticism, one that many skeptics cut their teeth on, is Uri Geller, the man who bends spoons with the power of his mind. At least, that\u2019s how he characterized himself in the 1970s and onward. I first heard about him when I was a teenager. Being a teenager and of not more than average skepticism, I was just as puzzled as many people were over Geller\u2019s spoon bending. Now, spoon bending is an obvious magic trick, which is why James Randi was so easily able to duplicate it and why he was so easily able, working with Johnny Carson, to expose Geller as a fraud on national TV: \n \n These days, it\u2019s so well known that spoon bending is a magic trick and not evidence of a man\u2019s ability to bend metal with his mind that a quick Google search for \u201cHow do you bend spoons?\u201d turns up many links that tell you just how to duplicate Geller\u2019s feat that amazed so many for so many decades, for instance: \n \n There\u2019s even a Wikipedia entry on spoon bending. \n \n This sort of skepticism is exactly the sort of skepticism that Horgan so contemptuously dismissed as \u201cBigfoot skepticism.\u201d After all, it\u2019s just a con man named Uri Geller bending spoons using a magic trick that most magicians know and fooling the public into thinking that he was using the \u201cpower of his mind\u201d to accomplish it. The skill set required to demonstrate that Geller was a fraud was straightforward and not particularly complex. That\u2019s why the story of Uri Geller\u2019s spoon bending con is a basic story that nearly all skeptics encounter fairly early on in their journey to becoming skeptics. It\u2019s the very epitome of what John Horgan considers wrong with organized skepticism. \n \n And yet\u2026 \n \n And yet there is a major Canadian academic medical center that had at least one faculty member that doesn\u2019t exercise skepticism about a woman who claims to be able to manipulate \u201clife energy\u201d from the \u201cuniversal source,\u201d which is what reiki is when you boil it down to its essence, and offers workshops on how to use the power of your mind to bend spoons. Just think about it. If the person putting together Pediatric Integrative Medicine Rounds for the University of Alberta had been inculcated with a bit of the ol\u2019 \u201cBigfoot skepticism,\u201d maybe he or she wouldn\u2019t have agreed to let Anastasia Kutt to do a workshop there. If that person knew that spoon bending was nothing more than a simple magician\u2019s trick, perhaps he or she wouldn\u2019t have fallen for Kutt\u2019s nonsense. That didn\u2019t happen, unfortunately. Bigfoot skepticism could have prevented this, but in the world of quackademic medicine there isn\u2019t even Bigfoot skepticism. There isn\u2019t much, if any, skepticism at all. More\u2019s the pity. \n \n Then, of course, Horgan also heaped his scorn on skeptics who debunk homeopathy. As I\u2019ve discussed many times in the past, on the surface, there doesn\u2019t appear to be much in the way of homeopathy in academic medical centers. However, if you consider how many CAM or \u201cintegrative medicine\u201d programs have naturopaths on faculty and offer naturopathy services, you\u2019ll soon realize that there are a lot of academic medical centers offering homeopathy. The reason is simple. Homeopathy is such an integral part of naturopathy that you can\u2019t have naturopathy without homeopathy. \n \n In fact, a little bit of that \u201cBigfoot skepticism\u201d could prevent atrocities against science-based medicine like the Pediatric Integrative Medicine (PIM) trial: \n \n The Pediatric Integrative Medicine Trial (\u201cPIM Trial\u201d) started recruitment of hospitalized children at the Stollery Children\u2019s Hospital in Edmonton, Alberta in early 2013, and the clinical intervention phase starts in the fall. While the initial focus is on children with cancer, plans to include children in other areas of the hospital are underway. Led by the CARE Program and supported by the University of Alberta, the trial will study the effects of an inpatient PIM service when added to conventional medical care. The service consists of pediatricians and credentialed therapists in acupuncture, massage therapy, and reiki who will offer consultations and treatments for children experiencing pain, nausea/vomiting, and/or anxiety (\u201cPNVA\u201d). Choice of therapy is guided by each patient and family, and informed by established research on its safety and effectiveness; there are no obligations to start or continue the PIM Trial\u2019s therapies, and there is no cost to the family or to the hospital. The trial will assess and compare costs, length of hospital stay, safety and effectiveness of therapies (CAM and conventional), and quality of life and satisfaction with care as determined by patients, their caregivers and health care providers. \n \n Of course, acupuncture and reiki are the purest of vitalistic quackery, modalities that have no place in any hospital purporting to provide evidence- and science-based care to patients. \u201cBigfoot skepticism\u201d is useful in identifying how reiki, at least, is quackery. Acupuncture is a little bit more difficult, given that it involves sticking actual needles into patients, but it\u2019s not that much more difficult to demonstrate that acupuncture is a theatrical placebo. Sadly, the University of Alberta is not alone in embracing quackery. It has lots of company. \n \n Scientific skepticism strives to separate claims that are supported by evidence and science from claims that are not. Claims like the ones made by Uri Geller over the years are clearly ridiculous, but, contrary to what Horgan seems to think, they are not at all unimportant because they are widely believed. In fact, they\u2019re so widely believed that they have served as the basis of a workshop offered by a respected academic medical center. All it would have taken is a single skeptic applying \u201cBigfoot skepticism\u201d to the claims being made by, for instance, the University of Alberta. Where was that skeptic? Nowhere, or so it would seem. It\u2019s not as though it\u2019s always difficult to test these sorts of implausible claims, either. Indeed, in the case of \u201ctherapeutic touch\u201d (also called \u201chealing touch\u201d), a form of \u201cenergy medicine\u201d widely taught in nursing school that posits that the person doing the therapeutic touch can sense and manipulate the patient\u2019s \u201cenergy field\u201d to healing effect, disproving the woo is so easy that even an 11-year-old can do it. Unfortunately, the environment at some academic medical centers has become so credulous that highly educated physicians and nurses accept this kind of nonsense. Sure, it\u2019s possible that a lot of physicians saw the spoon-bending flyer and scoffed derisively, but the very fact that the workshop was scheduled is a symptom of a serious problem. \n \n In fact, I\u2019d argue that we could use some \u201cBigfoot skeptics\u201d in medicine. Horgan paints efforts debunking homeopathy with the same brush, as taking on an \u201ceasy\u201d target that isn\u2019t worth the effort, but homeopathy is a multibillion dollar industry. We could use some in politics as well, because, for example, there is a whole category of health care pseudo-professionals called naturopaths for whom homeopathy is such an integral part of their practice that it is part of their licensing examination. In my state (Michigan), there is a bill, HB 4531, that would grant licensure and a broad scope of practice to naturopaths. If there were more \u201cBigfoot skeptics\u201d in our brain dead legislature, maybe the bill wouldn\u2019t have made it out of the House Committee on Health Policy to be considered by the whole House. \n \n Skepticism and critical thinking are a world view that is desperately lacking in most people. Horgan seems to think that it\u2019s not worthwhile to exercise these skills on anything less than world peace and complex questions about whether screening for cancer saves enough lives relative to the cost in money and overtreatment, but there are plenty of examples of much more straightforward questions need to be examined with science and a critical eye. Unfortunately, one of these examples is in medicine myself. If even a few physicians can be accepting enough of a claim that a common magician\u2019s trick is in reality evidence of the power of the mind that they\u2019re willing to schedule a workshop on spoon bending at a major medical center, we have a problem, and it\u2019s a problem that \u201cBigfoot skeptics\u201d are most suited to tackle. ||||| Published on Mar 1, 2011 \n \n Spoon boy: Do not try and bend the spoon.

    "document": "The African Union suspended the Central African Republic on Monday after rebels seized power in a rapid weekend assault on the capital, sending President Francois Bozize fleeing and triggering international appeals for calm. \n \n Rebel leader Michel Djotodia planned to declare himself president Monday after his Seleka coalition took control of Bangui in the wake of the collapse of a two-month-old peace deal with Bozize\u2019s regime. \n \n But the African Union took swift action on Monday amid international concern about the deteriorating security situation in the deeply unstable former French colony. \n \n \u201cThe council has decided to suspend with immediate effect Central African Republic from all African Union activities and to impose sanctions, travel restrictions and an asset freeze on Seleka\u2019s leaders,\u201d said AU peace and Security chief Ramtane Lamamra. \n \n South Africa said 13 of its soldiers were killed and 27 wounded in the weekend fighting in Bangui and condemned the rebel offensive. \n \n \u201cAs a member of the African Union, South Africa rejects any efforts to seize power by force,\u201d President Jacob Zuma told reporters, adding however that there were no immediate plans to withdraw troops helping the weak national army. \n \n Djotodia, a former civil servant turned rebel leader, said Sunday he would declare himself president but told Radio France Internationale the rebels would respect the terms of a January peace deal and would hold free and fair elections within three years. \n \n Opposition figure Nicolas Tiangaye, appointed prime minister of a national unity government formed as part of the accord that ended a previous Seleka offensive launched late last year, would remain in the post, he said. \n \n Bozize, who himself seized power in a coup in 2003, is said to have fled the Central African Republic but his whereabouts remain a mystery. \n \n One well-placed source told AFP that he had left the country in a helicopter, but did not disclose his destination. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius confirmed only that he had fled Bangui. \n \n International appeals \n \n About 20 members of Bozize\u2019s family were taken to the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, government spokesman Lambert Mende told AFP, but said the ousted leader was not on its soil. \n \n Djotodia said he may keep some ministers from Bozize\u2019s clan in his government, pledging: \u201cWe are not here to carry out a witch-hunt.\u201d \n \n Bangui residents initially welcomed the rebels, waving palm leaves in celebration but the optimistic atmosphere quickly soured into anxiety as gangs of armed looters roamed the riverside city, pillaging shops and offices including the premises of the UN children\u2019s agency UNICEF. \n \n And the international community has expressed concern over the situation in the country, which remains one of the poorest nations on earth although it has largely untapped mineral wealth including uranium, gold and diamonds. \n \n The US State Department said Sunday it was \u201cvery concerned by the worsening humanitarian situation in CAR and credible, widespread reports of human rights abuses by both national security forces and Seleka fighters\u201d. \n \n It also called for rebels to restore electricity and water to the capital which had been interrupted over the weekend. \n \n UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon also condemned the seizure of power by Seleka \u2014 a loose alliance of three rebel movements \u2014 calling for \u201cthe swift restoration of constitutional order\u201d. \n \n French President Francois Hollande called on all parties to form a government in accordance with the January peace deal hammered out in the Gabonese capital Libreville, and asked \u201cthe armed groups to respect the population\u201d, thousands of whom have already fled Bangui. \n \n Rebel fighters resumed hostilities last week after they accused Bozize of reneging on the terms of the January deal which aimed to put an end to a previous offensive launched by Seleka in December. \n \n The accord brought several prominent figures from Seleka into the government but it collapsed after the rebels said their demands, which included the release of people they described as political prisoners, had not been met. \n \n Seleka launched its first offensive on December 10, accusing Bozize of having failed to honour an earlier peace agreement. They seized a string of towns on their way south but stopped short of Bangui. ||||| (CNN) -- In just over a day, rebels seized the Central African Republic's capital, forced the president out of the country and declared the nation had \"opened a new page in its history.\" \n \n But no one knows what the next page will say. \n \n Michel Djotodia, the leader of the rebel alliance, the Seleka, declared himself the new president, and the rebel group says their takeover opens a path for peace and democracy. \n \n Yet questions abound over the future of impoverished, landlocked country -- and what this uprising means for its 5.1 million residents. \n \n Where is the Central African Republic? \n \n The Central African Republic is a landlocked nation in the center of the continent, slightly smaller than Texas. It is bordered by Cameroon, Chad, Sudan, South Sudan, the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \n \n A former French colony, it gained independence in August 1960. \n \n Its 5.1 million residents include various ethnic groups who speak several languages. Even though French is the official language, Sango is the primary one. \n \n What has been its form of government? \n \n For the first 30 years, the country was ruled mostly by military governments. Civilian rule was established in 1993 but lasted only 10 years, according to the CIA World Factbook. \n \n In March 2003, then-president Ange-Felix Patasse was deposed in a coup led by Gen. Francois Bozize. \n \n Bozize is now in Cameroon, from which he is seeking to move to another country, the Cameroon government said in a communique dated Monday. The statement said that despite his presence, the country shall adhere to a policy of non-intervention. \n \n How long was Bozize in power? \n \n Two years after he took over in a coup, Bozize called elections in 2005 -- which he won. \n \n In 2011, he was re-elected, but activists said the polling was marred by fraud. \n \n When did the rebellion start? \n \n From the beginning, Bozize did not have full control of the nation. Rebel groups operated, particularly in rural areas. \n \n In December 2012, several of the rebel groups banded together, calling themselves the Seleka, or \"coalition\" in the Sango language. They accused Bozize of reneging on a peace deal and demanded that he step down. \n \n Slowly, the rebels began taking over parts of the country. \n \n Didn't the two sides strike a new peace deal? \n \n Yes, Bozize and the Seleka brokered a peace deal in January, agreeing to form a unity government led by Bozize. \n \n But that deal also fell apart. \n \n What do the rebels want? \n \n Some say the Seleka want a greater opposition presence in the country's government after Bozize's presidential election wins were met with fraud allegations. \n \n But others say greed is a factor. \n \n Only 3.1% of the land is arable, but the country has an array of natural resources, including diamonds, gold and timber. \n \n \"Government officials from Bangui have accused Seleka of harboring 'foreign provocateurs' greedy for the country's vast mineral wealth, and there are suspicions that nationals from Chad, Nigeria, and Sudan also make up Seleka's ranks,\" African studies doctoral candidate Jason Warner wrote in a piece for CNN. \n \n How did the rebels take over the capital? \n \n For weeks, the Seleka rebel coalition pushed its way from its base in the north toward the capital city of Bangui, seizing towns along the way. \n \n Their efforts took a pivotal turn on March 24, when they infiltrated the capital. \n \n Witnesses reported hours of fierce gunfire in the city, and a government official said seven civilians were killed. \n \n Before he ended up in Cameroon, Bozize had crossed into the Democratic Republic of Congo by the end of the day, said Jules Gautier Ngbapo, a government spokesman. \n \n And the rebels issued a bold message: \n \n \"The Central African Republic has just opened a new page in its history,\" said a written statement from Justin Kombo Moustapha, secretary general of the Seleka rebels. \n \n The statement described Bozize as the country's former president and urged residents to remain calm and prepare themselves to welcome rebel forces. \n \n Why were South African soldiers in the country? \n \n South Africa sent 200 troops to the country in January to work with the military there to quash the rebellion. \n \n During the rebel advance, 13 South African soldiers were killed and 27 wounded, the South African president's office said. One soldier was unaccounted for. \n \n What is likely to happen next? \n \n That's what world leaders are scrambling to figure out. \n \n U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the \"unconstitutional seizure of power,\" echoing the African Union's dismay over the rebels' offensive. \n \n Ban's office said the United Nations will continue working with the African Union and the Economic Community of Central African States to find a solution. \n \n Rebel leader Djotodia declared himself the new president, and the rebel alliance said democratic elections will take place after three years. \n \n \"A new page is opening for peace and democracy in the CAR,\" Francois Nelson N'Djadder, a rebel spokesman, wrote. \n \n \"Bozize being gone, the Central Africans must gather around the table to talk and find a common path which will ... lead to the organization of democratic elections.\" \n \n What other challenges does the Central African Republic face? \n \n Despite its richness of natural resources, the country is stymied by a landlocked position, a poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force and a legacy of misdirected macroeconomic policies, the CIA's World Factbook said. \n \n Its per-capita GDP -- the country's economic output divided by the population -- is just $800, putting the country in 222nd place out of 228 countries. \n \n And more than one in 25 adults are afflicted with HIV or AIDS. \n \n READ MORE: Central African Republic president flees capital amid violence, official says \n \n CNN's Elwyn Lopez, Nana Karikari-apau and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report. ||||| BANGUI A rebel leader in Central African Republic pledged to name a power-sharing government after seizing the capital Bangui on Sunday and declaring himself president, a spokesman said, in a bid to defuse international outcry over the coup. \n \n The seizure of power by the Seleka rebel coalition - the latest in a series of coups and rebellions since the mineral-rich nation won independence from France in 1960 - was swiftly condemned by the United Nations and the African Union. \n \n The United States, France and regional powerbroker Chad called on Seleka leader Michel Djotodia to respect the terms of a January power-sharing agreement signed in the Gabonese capital Libreville. \n \n The agreement had created a government drawn from rebel leaders, the civilian opposition and loyalists of former president Francois Bozize. It was led by Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye, a former lawyer and member of the civilian opposition. \n \n \"We will respect the Libreville accord: a political transition of 2 to 3 years before elections,\" Seleka spokesman Eric Massi said by telephone. \"The current prime minister remains in place and the cabinet will be slightly reshuffled.\" \n \n Massi said the riverside capital Bangui was calm on Monday morning, though Seleka was still seeking to contain sporadic looting which broke out on Sunday after Bozize's fall. \n \n Seleka, a loose coalition of five rebel groups whose name means 'alliance' in the Songo language, had accused Bozize of breaking the January agreement by failing to integrate their fighters into the army. \n \n They launched hostilities on Thursday, quickly sweeping south to seize the capital, brushing aside a South African force of 400 troops which attempted to defend Bangui. A Reuters witness said at least nine South Africans were killed, in a setback to its efforts to project its influence on the region. \n \n FRENCH NATIONS SAFE \n \n Paris, which already had 250 soldiers in Central African Republic, has sent another 300 troops to ensure the security of its citizens and diplomatic installations. \n \n Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said there was no need to evacuate its 1,200 nationals, most of whom are in the capital. \n \n \"Things are under control from our point of view regarding French nationals,\" Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said on Europe 1 radio. \n \n Fabius said President Francois Hollande had spoken to U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and Chadian President Idriss Deby to suggest that any solution to the crisis should be based on the January Libreville agreement. \n \n \"For now, there is not legitimate authority there,\" he said, adding that it was not up to France to intervene in the internal affairs of the country. \n \n The U.S. State Department also called on Seleka to ensure the implementation of the Libreville agreement and provide full support to Tiangaye's government. Regional military power Chad said the same in a statement on Sunday. \n \n The whereabouts of Bozize was unclear, with unconfirmed reports that he was in Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. \n \n Bozize rose to prominence in the military during the 1966-1979 rule of former dictator Jean-Bedel Bokassa, a self-styled emperor. He seized power in a 2003 coup backed by Chad but his failure to make good on promises of power sharing after winning disputed 2011 polls led to the Seleka offensive. \n \n (Additional reporting by Ange Aboa in Yaounde and Leigh Thomas in Paris; Writing by Daniel Flynn; Editing by David Lewis)",

(Reuters) \n \n Oscar Pistorius is expected to be released in August from a prison in South Africa after serving 10 months of his five-year sentence for culpable homicide in the death of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. \n \n \u201cOscar will be released on parole by the end of August,\u201d a family member who requested anonymity told Reuters. \n \n Corrections officials did not comment, but Pistorius was eligible for release under \u201ccorrectional supervision\u201d after serving a sixth of his sentence. \n \n Pistorius, the South African sprinter who became a national hero for triumphing over the amputation of his legs as a baby, shot Steenkamp, a 29-year-old law school graduate and model, through a locked door in his bathroom on Valentine\u2019s Day 2013. Although prosecutors pushed for a murder conviction, Pistorius claimed that he mistakenly believed an intruder was in the house when he fired his gun. \n \n After a 10-month trial, he was convicted of the lesser charge, a decision the state is appealing. In a case to be heard in November, prosecutors will seek a murder conviction. If successful, Pistorius would face a minimum of 15 years in prison. \n \n Pistorius has been incarcerated at the Pretoria Central Prison since his conviction last fall and is expected to be released Aug. 21. ||||| Serving time: Pistorius was sentenced to five years for culpable homicide \n \n Disgraced sprinter Oscar Pistorius will be freed from prison in August, it has been reported. \n \n The athlete was sentenced to five years in jail last year for shooting dead his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp at his home in South Africa on Valentine's Day 2013. \n \n The Paralympian claimed the killing was a tragic mishap after he mistook her for an intruder. \n \n But the double amputee was found guilty of culpable homicide by a judge. \n \n He is eligible for release from prison to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest in August. \n \n And a family member has confirmed they expect Pistorius to leave jail in a matter of weeks. \n \n According to ENCA News, Pistorius was seen by a parole board last week and a date has been set for August 21. \n \n The family of Reeva Steenkamp reacted with dismay, saying Pistorius' ten months in prison is \"simply not enough\" of a punishment for his crime. \n \n In a statement they said: \"We have forgiven Mr Pistorius even though he took the life of our precious daughter Reeva. \n \n \"Our lives will never be the same again as live with the sadness of her death every day. \n \n \"Reeva had so much to offer this world and we were all robbed of her life when she was killed. \n \n \"As her family, we do not seek to avenge her death and we do not want Mr Pistorius to suffer; that will not bring her back to us. \n \n \"However a person found guilty of a crime must be held accountable for their actions. \n \n \"Statistics show that our society is under continuous attack form criminals and murderers. \n \n \"Incarceration of 10 months for taking a life is simply not enough. \n \n \"We fear that this will not send out the proper message and serve as the deterrent it should.\" \n \n But in a separate development, South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal set a date for prosecutors to appeal the runner's conviction for manslaughter. \n \n Getty Tragic: Reeva Steenkamp died after being shot through a toilet door \n \n The state believes Pistorius should have been convicted of murder and they will challenge the ruling in November. \n \n If successful, the Blade Runner could be locked up for life. \n \n Supreme Court of Appeal registrar Paul Myburgh said that chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel and defence lawyer Barry Roux have met with the president of the court. \n \n The Pistorius legal team claim the 28-year-old is so desperate to get his life back on track he wants to work with disadvantaged youngsters when released. \n \n A source said: \u201cHe is managing in jail, he\u2019s isolated but hanging in and praying to keep up his strength. \n \n \u201cHe is keen to become involved in assisting children in whatever opportunity comes up. His legal team are trying to help with this and sort a job.\u201d \n \n Pistorius has been held in a single cell at the notorious Kgosi Mumpuru prison, in Pretoria, over fears he will face attacks from violent inmates. \n \n After a six-month trial last year the Paralympian - known as the Blade Runner - was found not guilty of murder but guilty of culpable homicide. \n \n He was handed a five-year jail term but will serve just a sixth of that under South African laws. \n \n His solicitor, Barry Roux, who represented him throughout his legal fight, said: \u201c[Oscar] walks free in August and then has ten months on parole. \n \n \u201cThe parole conditions will be at their discretion, don\u2019t drink, go to church, no drugs, he\u2019ll have a psychological programme, an anger management course. \n \n \u201cThey will set the parameters and he will keep to them.\u201d He added: \u201cHe will leave prison in three months time and wherever he goes he will be Oscar Pistorius. \n \n Reuters \n \n \u201cThere is no way a man as famous as him can change his name. \n \n \u201cAnyway, How can you change your name, it\u2019s running away. Why would you want to change your name, it\u2019s disowning what happened. He will have to lift his head, and take it on the chin.\" \n \n Earlier this year images emerged of Pistorius playing football with Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir in a concrete courtyard. \n \n The two-minute clip, which shows Pistorius practising penalty shoot-outs with the notorious underworld figure on trial for kidnapping, sparked condemnation from South African prison authorities. \n \n But Mr Roux defended the footage, claiming it was a misrepresentation of how Pistorius was being treated in prison. \n \n VIEW GALLERY \n \n He said: Mr Roux said: \u201cOscar is in a single cell, we had to make the choice between the devil and the deep blue sea. \n \n \u201cDo you put him in a cell with inmates, with all the horrible associated risks of attacks and tormenting, or in a single cell with the loneliness and isolation? \n \n \u201cAt least this way he is protected. His cell is three metres by two metres. Life is lonely. \n \n \u201cHe spends 18 hours-a-day in isolation seven days a week. He has one hour a day for physical exercise. \n \n \u201cPeople completely misunderstood when they saw a photo of him playing soccer with the notorious Czech fugitive Radovan Krejcir. \n \n \u201cThe man is also in the hospital section and he had his hour of exercise at the same time one day, so they kicked a ball around for a few minutes. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s all it was, its not like Oscar has a life of leisure and football.\u201d \n \n Reuters \n \n Mr Roux also revealed Pistorius had rejected a string of Hollywood film offers and book deals - despite being broke. \n \n He said: \u201cAll Oscar has to his name is the shirt on his back and his underpants. \n \n \u201cOscar has spent all his money. I was not paid for the last two months, but I just could not \u2018walk away\u2019, I couldn\u2019t morally do that. \n \n \u201cOscar was left with nothing, he is totally and utterly penniless, I mean zero. The shirt on his back and his underpants. That\u2019s all he has. \n \n \u201cThe case has cost him at least two million Rand. He sold his brand new Audi, all his art, his watches, even his guns I believe. \n \n \u201cHe has never discussed the book or movie offers but they have poured in. He has in fact declined the book offers and Hollywood options every time, and he has been right to decline.\u201d",

The original event was code-named pi\u00f1ata. (Photo: Elizabeth Weise) \n \n SEATTLE\u2014At Amazon headquarters here, two floors of conference rooms are outfitted as war rooms, the better to absorb the crushing blow of 85 million Prime shoppers feverishly tapping on the best slow cooker deals. \n \n Prime Day (or Prime Day plus six hours) is almost here. \n \n What started as an experiment to shake-up the shopping doldrums of July, with perhaps a sprinkle of inspiration from Alibaba's wildly successful Single's Day, has turned into one of Amazon's biggest sales days. \n \n Last year, analysts estimate Prime Day sales totaled between $500 million and $600 million, or 1.5% of its third quarter sales \u2014 compared with the $3.34 billion spent online by Americans this past Black Friday at retailers. Amazon (AMZN), which does not release sales figures for the event, said they surpassed the prior year's Prime Day by more than 60% worldwide. \n \n While this year\u2019s Prime Day will almost certainly out-perform last year\u2019s, in the bigger picture Prime Day just isn't as relevant as holiday sales in November and December, said Alasdair McLean-Foreman, founder of Teikametrics, a company that provides data analytics and optimization technology for sellers on e-commerce platforms. \n \n Sales are by no means the only important metric. At heart, Prime Day is \u201canother excellent branding opportunity to own consumer mind share,\u201d McLean-Foreman said. \n \n Related: \n \n Bursting digital shopping carts help Amazon and the tens of thousands of companies that sell on its site to level out demand over the year, adding a nice bump of sales in July when things are typically flat, says Gene Alvarez, an analyst who follows the company for Gartner. \n \n It\u2019s also a chance for Amazon to tout voice-ordering and to get more people engaged with its Echo voice-operated devices. \n \n But mostly it\u2019s a chance for Amazon to gather information, both in general and as a kind of stress test for the holidays. \n \n Amazon\u2019s vice president for Prime, stands in the conference room where his team oversaw Amazon\u2019s first Prime Day sale in 2015. The event was code-named Pi\u00f1ata and the room was decorated with pi\u00f1ata cutouts and actual pi\u00f1atas. The one he holds in his hand was the only pi\u00f1ata remaining in the conference room in 2017. (Photo: Elizabeth Weise/USA TODAY) \n \n \u201cPrime Day is about experimenting and learning more about the customer experience and willingness to shop in new ways,\u201d Alvarez said. \n \n Amazon is prepping for this year's Prime Day, which starts Monday at 9 PM Eastern and runs for 30 hours across 13 countries, to be a big one. \n \n Amazonians (Amazon's internal name for its workers) who work on Prime are expected to block off June and much of July and take their summer vacations after the dust has cleared. \n \n Code Name: Pinata \n \n It\u2019s all a long way from its beginnings as a doldrums of July sale, originally code-named Pi\u00f1ata. \n \n The first Prime Day in 2015 got off to a somewhat inauspicious start. The team focused on the event had taken over a small conference room decorated with Pi\u00f1ata cutouts as its operations center. \n \n Prime hit first in Japan, 16 hours ahead of Seattle. As the sale began there, customers rushed online to start buying and the Amazon.jp site promptly crashed. \n \n Greg Greeley, Amazon\u2019s vice president for Prime, literally fell off his chair as he lunged to deal with the problem. The team got the site up and running again in two minutes but the magnitude of what they\u2019d launched was clear. \n \n \u201cI got on the phone with AWS and I told them, \u2018When the sun comes up here, this is going to be huge,\u2019\u201d he told USA TODAY last week. \n \n The first Prime Day in 2015 came about as the company was casting about for a celebration for its twentieth anniversary, though it resembled Singles\u2019 Day in China, an obscure event for bachelors that the Chinese digital giant Alibaba turned into a cultural event beginning in 2009, selling $17.8 billion in goods last year. \n \n Just as with Black Friday deals, the question for consumers is always whether they\u2019re getting deals or duds. Amazon\u2019s first try at Prime Day in 2015 was panned by some because too many deals seemed instead to be merchants clearing out unsold inventory, with Twitter calling out garage-sale like goods such as shoe horns and granny panties. \n \n The next year Prime Day felt a lot more like Black Friday, though an analysis by The Wirecutter found that while there were thousands of deals, few were what it termed \"great deals.\" \n \n This year, Amazon is pledging that price for all its limited-time lightning deals will be the lowest for that item offered on its site in the last 365 days. \n \n It won't be the only game in town. JCPenney, Kohl's and Macy's are all offering exclusive discounts before and during Prime Day, though Walmart, Target and Lowe's are among the big names who appear to be skipping the event. \n \n Amazon uses both human and robot workers in its warehouses. (Photo: Amazon) \n \n In the first two years Prime Day was also a big enticement for customers to sign up for Amazon\u2019s Prime membership service, which offers free two-day shipping and same-day shipping in many cities plus a host of perks. \n \n Prime members are a major sweet spot for Amazon. According to figures released last week by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, there are now 85 million highly remunerative Prime members in the United States, up from 65 million a year ago. Once in the Amazon eco-system they spend on average about $1,300 per year, compared to about $700 per year for non-member customers. \n \n Forrester\u2019s Amazon analyst Brendan Witcher expects the company to heavily promote its Echo family of voice-activated devices as it continues efforts to build-out its already substantial lead in voice assistants. This includes the new Echo Show, which comes with a 7\" screen. \n \n Amazon Echo Show (Photo: Reviewed.com / Jackson Ruckar) \n \n \u201cIt wouldn't surprise me if almost every step of the purchasing journey will include some mention of Amazon Echo,\u201d he said. \n \n Amazon\u2019s overall goal, which Prime Day contributes to, is to do with retail what Apple did with music \u2013 build an ecosystem of delivery that will become an ecosystem of buying, Witcher said. \n \n The work that Amazon has put into Prime Day is paying off for the third-party sellers on Amazon\u2019s site, who now make up more than 50% of units sold by the company. \n \n Austin, Texas-based Silk Innovation sells mobile phone cases. The company set its sales targets in the spring, ordering from China and having the products shipped directly to Amazon fulfillment centers. \n \n CEO Matt Altschul expects a 25% jump in sales in July due to Prime Day. \n \n \u201cI wish I had a story to tell you that everything\u2019s wild and we all had to work our butts off, but I don\u2019t,\" he said. \"It\u2019s the beauty of Amazon\u2019s automation.\u201d \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2u8NTs2 ||||| Amazon.com\u2019s (amzn) Prime Day on Tuesday was marred with many customers reporting problems checking out, potentially denting business on a day the online retailer is hoping will yield hundreds of millions of dollars in sales and spur sign ups to its Prime program. \n \n On Tuesday morning at 7:40 Eastern time, the retailer said on Twitter that some customers were having problems with the website. At 11:18 a.m., or two and half hours later, the company told Fortune by email that the problem had been resolved. \n \n Some customers are reporting difficulty with checkout. We're working to resolve this issue quickly. \u2014 Amazon.com (@amazon) July 12, 2016 \n \n But by then, Amazon was dealing with angry shoppers. Earlier, some customers took to Twitter to also complain about problems like adding items to carts. And by early morning, the hashtag #PrimeDayFail, which gained traction during last year\u2019s inaugural event after many customers were underwhelmed by items included in the deals, was trending again. \n \n Sad to wake up early for Prime Day & NOT be able to add to cart. #PrimeDayFail \u2014 John Gann (@thejohngann) July 12, 2016 \n \n The snafus were poorly timed for the online retailer, whose $81 billion in annual sales make it the largest e-commerce player in the U.S. by far, doing six times more business than Walmart.com (wmt). Still, investors shrugged off the problems as the stock hit an all-time high on Tuesday. \n \n Amazon debuted Prime Day last year as a one-day sale exclusively for members of its Prime subscription shopping service. The company\u2019s goal is to create a new shopping holiday like Black Friday\u2014the busy shopping day after Thanksgiving\u2014to encourage more spending on its site. While Prime Day is a manufactured shopping event, the sale is a big deal for Amazon: retail advisory firm FBIC, has forecast predicts Prime Day could generate $525 million in sales, up 26 percent from its $415 million estimate last year. \n \n The larger point for Amazon is to stoke enrollment in its Prime service, which for $99 a year, among many benefits, offers customers free two-day delivery and access to Amazon\u2019s TV and movie streaming service. Prime enrollments peaked on July 14 last year, one day before Prime Day. According to comScore data, 21.7 million unique visitors went to Amazon.com on Prime Day last year, making it as big a deal as Cyber Monday. And Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimated this week that 63 million people in the U.S. are Prime members, up 43% from a year earlier. \n \n Amazon\u2019s Prime Day has prompted many traditional retailers to hold their own events. Most notably, Walmart this week waived minimum online order sizes to get free shipping. \n \n The Amazon snafus are reminiscent of website problems retailers like Target (tgt), Best Buy (bby) and Neiman Marcus have all dealt with in the last few years on major online shopping occasions. ||||| Now playing: Watch this: The real deals of Amazon Prime Day \n \n It's beginning to look a lot like Prime Day. \n \n On the evening of Monday, July 10 at 9 p.m. ET/6 p.m. PT, and 6 p.m. in the UK, Amazon will kick off its third annual sales event. It's basically a Cyber-Monday-in-July that promises extra savings over and above the company's usual discount prices. But that evening start is reminiscent of Black Friday sales that start on Thanksgiving: This year's Prime Day runs for 30 hours, straight through July 11. \n \n So who's allowed to get in on this Prime action? What's going to be different compared with last year? How can you be sure Amazon's Prime Day price is actually the best price? \n \n I've got all the answers. Here's everything you need to know about Prime Day 2017. \n \n Days of Prime Day past \n \n Amazon's first stab at Prime Day (in 2015) was to celebrate its 20th anniversary. Although the event proved a big success in terms of sales, customers found a lot to dislike. The biggest discounts were on Amazon's own products (Kindles, Fire tablets, Echo products and so on), and those seemed to come and go at random. \n \n Last year, things went better, with lots more inventory and category-driven search that made it easier to sift through the nearly 100,000 sale items. \n \n Why you should care about Prime Day \n \n In 2016, Amazon's big categories were TV and toys. The company promised twice as much TV inventory as \"Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined,\" and toy deals that would run \"nearly all day.\" \n \n Will those be the spotlight categories this year as well? That remains to be seen, but there will undoubtedly be countless other deals. And Amazon will offer Alexa-powered specials as well, so if you own an Amazon Echo ( ), Dot or Tap, you might be able to score some exclusives. (You can already ask Alexa to spill some rumors.) \n \n Amazon is also promising savings of \"up to 40 percent\" on Kindle Unlimited membership, though it's not quite clear what the \"up to\" part is about. Currently, the ebook/audiobook subscription service costs $9.99 per month, or \u00a37.99 in the UK. \n \n ...and why you shouldn't care \n \n If we haven't met before, I'm Rick \"The Cheapskate\" Broida, and I write about tech deals pretty much every day of the year. And let me tell you, every day is Prime Day. By which I mean there are great bargains to be had all the time. \n \n Yes, as with Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Amazon may shave a few extra dollars off a TV or Kindle. But also as with those days, supplies will be limited. And the TV might be an off-brand model that wasn't really what you had in mind. \n \n In other words, resist the hype. If there's a particularly good deal to be had on a product you've been eyeballing, by all means grab it. But don't think this is your only opportunity to save big. \n \n Furthermore, with Amazon planning to roll out new deals \"as often as every 5 minutes\" throughout the day, this is a rabbit hole you might want to avoid. Prime Day will definitely not be Productivity Day if you're refreshing your browser every 5 minutes. (Though see below for a handy way to keep tabs on specific deals.) \n \n Prime Day is for Prime subscribers \n \n Amazon Prime is, of course, the subscription service that affords unlimited two-day shipping, movie and unlimited music streaming and various other perks. It costs $99 per year (a very good deal, in my humble opinion), or \u00a379 in the UK. \n \n In order to take advantage of Prime Day deals, you must be a Prime subscriber. That's the bad news; the good news is that if you've never tried the service before, you can get a free trial -- and that trial membership qualifies you for Prime Day savings. \n \n By the way, if you're a US college student, you can get a six-month free trial of Amazon Prime, after which you can snag a membership for just $49 -- 50 percent off the regular annual price. \n \n Prime Day deals have already started (sort of) \n \n Head over to amazon.com/primeday (here in the UK) and you'll find some deals rotating in and out before the official kickoff on July 10. Some of the deals are better than others. For instance, as of Friday, July 7, there are digital versions of some pretty great movies on sale for just $5. I'll update the post if there's anything further to report. \n \n Use the Amazon App to get deal notifications \n \n Amazon \n \n Part of the challenge of Prime Day is keeping tabs on the deals that interest you, especially those scheduled to begin later in the day. If you forget, you might miss out. \n \n Fortunately, the Amazon App lets you track upcoming deals and receive notifications when they're about to begin. It's available for Amazon Fire (natch), Android and iOS in their respective app stores. (The app also affords benefits like voice-powered search and shipment tracking.) \n \n Don't assume Prime Day is the best day \n \n As I noted above, where I come from, every day is Black Friday, Cyber Monday or Prime Day. That means you should approach every deal with a little bit of skepticism -- or at least a little bit of research. \n \n One great place to start: CamelCamelCamel, the site that tracks Amazon price histories. (It can also notify you when Amazon products go on sale; I recently explained how to use it to track those rare Amazon Echo deals and you can see Amazon's current deal offerings here.) \n \n Before you pull the trigger on any Prime Day deal, copy the URL, paste it into CamelCamelCamel's search field and check the results. You may discover that the product has indeed been priced lower in the past, and therefore may be again. \n \n At the same time, consider using a browser plug-in such as Honey, which can instantly inform you if any third-party sellers have the same product for a lower price (which doesn't happen often, but it's worth checking). \n \n Finally, be sure to check other sites. Best Buy, Walmart and other major stores may well trot out their own answers to Prime Day, offering loss-leader pricing on popular items. \n \n How waitlisting works \n \n Screenshot by Rick Broida/CNET \n \n Like Amazon's daily Lightning deals, most Prime Day deals are available in limited quantities -- and once they're \"claimed,\" they're gone. Or maybe not: You may see a Join Waitlist button that'll put you in the queue to grab an item if it becomes available. \n \n How does that happen? Sometimes other customers will add an item to their cart, then decide not to buy it (or fail to complete the purchase within 15 minutes) -- at which point it goes to the next person in line. That could be you, so don't be shy about joining the waitlist if it's something you really want. \n \n Ask Alexa for exclusive deals \n \n Amazon already offers exclusive deals to owners of the Echo, Echo Dot, Tap and other Alexa-enhanced devices: You just say, \"Alexa, what are your deals?\" \n \n It should come as no surprise, then, that Amazon's gal is serving up Prime Day exclusives as well -- starting with a deal on Prime itself. If you're not already a subscriber, you can say, \"Alexa, sign me up for Prime,\" and you'll get an annual membership for $79 instead of the usual $99. \n \n Beyond that, ask Alexa for \"Prime Day deals,\" both leading up to the big day and on the day itself. One item to consider: the Bose SoundLink Bluetooth Speaker III. Alexa will score you a $50 discount, a bit better than the $41 discount afforded to regular Amazon shoppers. \n \n Editors' note: This article was originally published on July 5, 2016, and has since been updated. ||||| Amazon is hoping to lure more shoppers to its Prime member program with its annual Prime Day. Deals for shoppers actually begin a little earlier, starting this evening. The company claims there will be \"hundreds of thousands of deals\" with \"new deals starting as often as every five minutes.\" But if you're hoping to save twice - deals plus sales tax-free shopping - think again: as of April 1, 2017, Amazon began collecting sales taxes from all states with a sales tax. That means that Prime Day 2017 won't be sales tax-free. \n \n The online retail giant had previously fought the imposition of sales tax on a state by state basis - from court battles to corporate exemptions. Today, Amazon collects sales tax in 45 states plus the District of Columbia (you can see the list here). Amazon does not collect sales tax in Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon: those states do not have a state sales tax. \n \n Collecting sales tax on online purchases has been a controversial subject for years. Companies which make sales over the internet are still subject to the same sales tax collection requirements as so-called \"brick and mortar\" stores. Generally, the test is whether the company has a physical presence in that state: if a company has a physical presence in a state, they are required to collect and remit sales taxes. The test is the result of 25-year-old Supreme Court ruling in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota. In that case, the Court ruled that only those companies with a physical presence inside a state can be required to collect sales tax, \"continuing value of a bright-line rule in this area.\" The key, of course, is that the definition of physical presence can change even as technology changes - and the definition isn't consistent from state to state. \n \n In Massachusetts, for example, a new rule would have applied sales tax to certain out-of-state businesses who use internet cookies. Internet cookies are data files which are stored on your computer by a web browser and contain information about you - often, your name and interests - that companies use to tailor your internet experience. The Department of Revenue in Massachusetts claims that like software, internet cookies are \"present in the state and serve to facilitate such vendor\u2019s in-state sales.\" That, they believed, was enough of a presence to require the collection of sales tax. \n \n NetChoice, a trade association of Internet companies and organizations, and American Catalog Mailers Association (\"ACMA\"), a trade association representing the interests of companies, individuals, and organizations engaged in and supporting catalog marketing, disagreed. In June, the two organizations filed suit to stop the new rule from taking effect. Among the arguments in the lawsuit were allegations that the Commonwealth had not followed proper procedures with respect to the directive. \n \n The rule, which was expected to take effect on July 1, 2017, was eventually revoked. However, it's not completely buried. I fully expect to see it again after some procedural tweaks. And other states are watching closely to see what happens. If the revised rule successfully moves forward, it could change the way that state revenue departments view - and tax - online sales from out of state retailers. \n \n (You can read more about the history of sales tax and presence here.) \n \n Of course, even if a company doesn't charge you sales tax, that doesn't mean that you get a pass. States that impose sales tax typically also impose use tax. Use tax is the equivalent of sales tax for taxable purchases not taxed at sale by the retailer - like that furniture you bought across state lines in a sales tax-free state. If a purchase is subject to use tax, you are supposed to self-report and pay the tax. About half of all states offer a line on their income tax returns now for this purpose; otherwise, there are separate tax forms for your completion. \n \n As you can imagine, between the complexity and the insanity of this rule, most consumers ignore the use tax. A 2015 poll conducted by the International Council of Shopping Centers (ICSC) found that 62% of registered voters were not aware that use taxes were payable (downloads as a pdf). Most of those polled felt that the best way to collect sales tax was to tax at sale, not by asking consumers to self-report and pay. \n \n Some states have pretty aggressive enforcement divisions which target use tax. It's easier, as you can imagine, when retailers keep track of sales for out-of-state buyers (car dealers and art houses often do this). Now, some states, like Colorado, are passing new rules to require out of state retailers to report more information about sales. Many online retailers who are either seeing the writing on the wall or are weary of fighting against the inevitable, have been quietly shifting operations to collect sales tax in most states. Amazon is one of the largest retailers to do so: founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, Amazon reported revenues of $107.01 billion in 2016. The company is ranked at #237 in Forbes' Global 2000 and #12 on Forbes' list of the Most Valuable Brands. \n \n So, be prepared to pony up sales tax for purchases made on Amazon in most states. You can find Prime Day deals on amazon.com/primeday from 6 pm PT / 9 pm ET on July 10 (if you use Alexa on the Echo, Dot, Tap, Show, Fire TV/Fire compatible tablets, or the Dash Wand, deals start 2 hours earlier). According to Amazon, new deals start as often as every 5 minutes for 30 hours straight. \n \n Want more taxgirl goodness? Pick your poison: follow me on twitter, hang out on Facebook and Google, play on Pinterest or check out my YouTube channel. ||||| Now playing: Watch this: The real deals of Amazon Prime Day \n \n July 10 will mark the start of the third annual Prime Day -- or Amazon's massive 30-hour sale. With nearly 100,000 products on sale and with staggered start times for deals, it can be a lot to take in. And with so many people watching and waiting for deals to go live, some of the best will come and go in a hurry. \n \n Fortunately, you can set up alerts for deals that you're interested in. Here are three ways to get notified of deals on Prime Day. \n \n Watch deals \n \n Taylor Martin/CNET \n \n You can't sit around waiting all day for the deals you're interested in to go live. And if you're not careful, you might forget to check in and miss a deal. \n \n With the Amazon Shopping app on Android and iOS, you can watch upcoming deals so you're alerted when they go live. \n \n Tap the hamburger button in the top left to expand the menu and select Today's Deals. Swipe left to switch to the Upcoming tab to view all the deals which haven't started yet. Beneath each item is a button that says Watch this deal. The first time you hit the button, you will be asked to enable notifications. Once you do, any time a deal you're watching goes live, you will receive a push notification. \n \n If push notifications still aren't working, you may need to enable notifications in the app settings. Tap the hamburger button in the top left to expand the menu and tap Settings. Then tap Notifications and to the right of Your Watched & Waitlisted Deals make sure the toggle is in the On position. \n \n All of the deals you're watching can be found under the Watching tab. Deals that have gone live will appear in larger card views at the top, while upcoming deals are listed below. Deals will jump to the top of the list -- ahead of those that are already available -- when they're just minutes away from going live. \n \n To stop watching a deal, either locate the item again under the Upcoming tab or in the Watching tab. If the deal hasn't started yet, tap the Watching button to stop watching it. If the deal has gone live, you will need to tap the action overflow button (three vertical dots) and select Stop watching this deal. \n \n Add items to your wish list \n \n Taylor Martin/CNET \n \n Browsing the upcoming deals is only one way to tackle Prime Day. But what are the odds that you're going to see something you're actually looking for in the never-ending list of upcoming deals on Prime Day? \n \n You're better off approaching it from the other direction by building a list of items you need or want. Then, on Prime Day, Amazon will notify you if items from your wish list are part of a Prime Day deal. So it's wise to spend some time perusing Amazon to curate (or prune) your wish list ahead of Prime Day. \n \n While browsing Amazon from the Android or iOS apps, you can quickly add items to your wish list by long pressing and dragging it to your list at the bottom. \n \n Better wish list alerts \n \n Taylor Martin/CNET \n \n Not all Prime Day deals are worth getting excited about. In fact, if the last two years serve as any indication, most of the deals are just all right. \n \n However, if you want to make sure you're getting the best deal possible for the items on your Amazon wish list, you'll want to enlist the help of one of the best price tracking services out there, camelcamelcamel. \n \n Typically, people use camelcamelcamel to create individual price alerts, so when a item's price drops below a certain threshold, they receive an alert. But camelcamelcamel has an even better feature: wish list sync. This allows you to build your Amazon wish list and create a rule for which you want to be notified. For instance, I'm only notified when the price of an item drops to at least one penny below its lowest price ever. Best of all, it creates an RSS feed for your price drop alerts, so you can even add the alerts to your favorite RSS reader. \n \n To set up wish list alerts: \n \n Go to camelcamelcamel.com and login or create an account. \n \n At the top of the site, click Your account . \n \n . In the left menu, click Wishlists . \n \n . Click Add Wishlist . \n \n . Go to your Amazon wish list and click Share (an email icon just above the list of items). \n \n (an email icon just above the list of items). Copy the list URL and paste it in the Wishlist URL field on camelcamelcamel. \n \n field on camelcamelcamel. Under Advanced Options , select which prices you wish to watch (Amazon, third-party new and third-party used). \n \n , select which prices you wish to watch (Amazon, third-party new and third-party used). Set a desired price, either a static price or an amount below the current or lowest recorded price. \n \n Click Add Wishlist to finish. \n \n Now when the price of anything on your Amazon wish list drops below a certain threshold (set by you), you will receive an email notification. You can also view the deal in your RSS reader or by going to camelcamelcamel.com directly. \n \n Also, be sure to check out Rick Broida's list of 9 things you should know about Prime Day. ||||| Yesterday\u2019s checkout glitches didn\u2019t impact Amazon\u2019s ability to pull off another successful Prime Day sales event, as it turns out. The online retailer announced this morning, without giving specific figures, that its Prime Day 2016 was the \u201cbiggest ever.\u201d Not just in terms of other Prime Days, either, but the \u201cbiggest day in the history of Amazon .\u201d Tuesday\u2019s customer orders were up by more than 60 percent worldwide, compared with last year\u2019s Prime Day, and up by more than 50 percent in the U.S. Amazon says it was also the \u201cbiggest day ever\u201d for Amazon devices globally. \n \n This contradicts early reports that seemed to indicate that Amazon\u2019s Prime Day 2016 U.S. sales were flat, according to ChannelAdvisor. However, ChannelAdvisor doesn\u2019t monitor Amazon\u2019s first-party sales, like those on its own devices \u2013 it only examines a sample of Amazon seller data. \n \n Instead, Amazon\u2019s announcement is more in line with analyst expectations of Prime Day doubling last year\u2019s sales, potentially even hitting close to a billion, some believed. \n \n Amazon had discounted a variety of its devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Echo speakers, and more. These discounts were clearly able to boost Amazon\u2019s overall sales for the day, as was the fact that Amazon better spread out its sales throughout the day, compared with last year. Many of its limited-time \u201cLightning deals,\u201d for example, launched in the evening on Prime Day. \n \n The retailer says that it sold over 2.5 times more Fire TV devices compared with last year, and Fire TV Stick was the best seller globally of all Amazon\u2019s devices. Amazon said it sold hundreds of thousands of Kindle devices on Prime Day, as well. \n \n In the U.S., Amazon device sales were up by 3 times, compared with Prime Day 2015. And Prime Day was the biggest day ever for Amazon\u2019s smart connected speaker Echo, which was also up over 2.5 times from last year. Current Echo owners were even shopping Prime Day via their speakers, the retailer notes, as Prime members bought on average one Alexa-exclusive deal per second via voice. \n \n Amazon didn\u2019t tout how many of its Dash buttons sold \u2013 the push-button ordering dongles that were marked down to $0.99 on Prime Day \u2013 but said that top brands were Cascade, Charmin and Tide. \n \n Other top sellers included TVs (more than 90,000 sold), over 2 million toys and over 1 million shoes, 14,000+ Lenovo laptops, 23,000+ iRobot vacuums, over 200,000 headphones, and more. \n \n Just as important, Amazon seems to have recovered from last year\u2019s consumer backlash against Prime Day. Despite its great numbers in 2015, Amazon customers derided the sales event as \u201can online garage sale\u201d due to the junky nature of some of the deals, and their inability to catch the best offers before they were sold out. \n \n According to Adobe Digital Insights, which tracked over 4 million social engagements by online consumers, people were happier this year with Prime Day than in 2015. \n \n 39 percent of overall sentiment was related to sadness this year, compared with 50 percent last year. Joy increased to 30 percent, up from 23 percent in 2015. 22 percent of sentiment was attributed to admiration and 9 percent to surprise, both which tend to be on the positive side of the scale. \n \n In addition, even those who were complaining online weren\u2019t doing so because of deal quality. Instead, the checkout glitches \u2013 a purely technical matter \u2013 were to blame. \n \n Adobe also noted that the most positive chatter was around Kindle products, Echo, and the Xbox One bundle. \n \n Oh, and in case you\u2019re wondering \u2013 Amazon says it will being doing Prime Day again next year. No surprise there. \n \n (Article updated 7/13/16, 1:40 PM ET with Adobe\u2019s more current statistics.) ||||| Prime Day starts tonight! And if you\u2019re hoping to grab some of the hottest deals, vigilance is critical. The problem: You\u2019ve got a life to lead \u2014and constantly refreshing the Amazon homepage at your desk isn\u2019t a good way to impress your boss. \n \n Fortunately, there are a number of ways to track the onslaught of bargains. Just remember that if you see one that intrigues you, you may need to act fast. \n \n The app \u2013 Amazon\u2019s Shopping App (available for Android and iOS) is the most direct way to keep an eye out for discounts on items on your wishlist. Go to the app\u2019s settings menu, click notifications and toggle alerts on for \u201cYour Watched and Waitlisted Deals.\u201d From there, go to the main dashboard and select \u201cToday\u2019s Deals\u201d (it\u2019s a long list). See something you want? Select the \u201cWatch this deal\u201d button below it. \n \n Alexa \u2013 Amazon\u2019s Echo devices are getting first crack at a number of exclusive deals. If you\u2019ve got one in proximity, ask, \u201cAlexa, what are your deals?\u201d and she\u2019ll read out bargains to you regularly. (Just be sure you\u2019ve enabled voice purchasing beforehand.) \n \n Amazon Assistant \u2013 If you can\u2019t keep the Amazon homepage open throughout the day, you can enable it to push alerts to you. Amazon Assistant is a browser add-on that provides instant deal notifications (as well as order updates, etc.). \n \n CamelCamelCamel.com \u2013 Not all Prime Day deals are actually deals. CamelCamelCamel doesn\u2019t track Prime Day sales, per se, but it does follow the price history of all products on Amazon. You can set it to send an alert when the price drops to a certain point. That way, you\u2019re not only among the first to know when the deal hits, but you won\u2019t fall for \u201cspecial prices\u201d that aren\u2019t all that special. \n \n SlickDeals \u2013 There are a number of deal hunting Websites online, but few are as voracious as SlickDeals.net. The site has a Web-based price tracker that can alert you to deals not only on Amazon, but on other sites. \n \n Facebook \u2013 Odds are you\u2019re going to be checking in on Facebook Monday evening and sporadically throughout Tuesday anyway, so make it work for you. Head over to Amazon\u2019s page on the social network and follow it. Last year, the company sent out extra deal notifications via Facebook and while it hasn\u2019t made any announcements about doing so again this year, it can\u2019t hurt.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Will the third time be the charm for Amazon? Its now-slightly-misnomered Prime Day (it's actually 30 hours long, not 24, this year) kicks off at 9pm EDT Monday. Its inaugural sale in 2015 didn't blow consumers over; in 2016 there were early-morning website issues for some customers. This year, Amazon is ready, at least by USA Today's account, which notes that two floors of conference rooms at HQ have been \"outfitted as war rooms\" to support the onslaught of shoppers, all of whom must have a Prime membership to get the deals. More: The figures: Prime Day 2016 saw an estimated $500 million to $600 million in sales (Amazon didn't release official numbers). That's a fraction of the $3.34 billion spent on the Black Friday that followed months later, but Amazon said the total was up 60% over 2015, with 2017's Prime Day expected to be even bigger. What does bigger look like? Beating 2016 Prime Day records like these perhaps, per TechCrunch: More than 90,000 TVs, 1 million shoes, 23,000 iRobot vacuums, and 200,000 headphones were sold. It's a win-win for Amazon: There's a big upside involved in reeling in new Prime shoppers (the count has increased about 20 million year-over-year in the US, to 85 million): Their Amazon spending is almost double that of a non-Prime customer: $1,300 a year versus $700. What's on sale? Some 100,000 items, per CNET, but those items don't all go on sale at once. It offers tips on how to be alerted to the best deals (one smart one involves using your Amazon Wish List). Fortune offers some other ways, including a convenient-sounding Alexa tip. So are the deals deals? In some cases. Quartz points out that the Wirecutter gadget-review site examined 8,000 deals last Prime Day and recommended fewer than 1% of them: 64. One handy tool: CamelCamelCamel.com, which prompts you to input a product URL and then lets you know how that stacks up to what Amazon has charged for the item in the past. There's reason to care: ... and also reason to avoid the \"rabbit hole\" altogether. Rick Broida makes both cases at CNET. One dose of reality: If you've enjoyed Amazon's tax-free shopping in the past, it's, well, a thing of the past. Forbes points out that since April 1, Amazon has been levying sales tax for shoppers in all states with a sales tax (five don't have one: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon).",

    "document": "BRAS\u00cdLIA \u2014 The Senate on Wednesday impeached Dilma Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s first female president, and removed her from office for the rest of her term, the capstone of a power struggle that has consumed the nation for months and toppled one of the hemisphere\u2019s most powerful political parties. \n \n The Senate voted 61 to 20 to convict Ms. Rousseff on charges of manipulating the federal budget in an effort to conceal the nation\u2019s mounting economic problems. \n \n But the final removal of Ms. Rousseff, who was suspended in May to face trial, was much more than a judgment of guilt on any charge. It was a verdict on her leadership and the slipping fortunes of Latin America\u2019s largest country. \n \n The impeachment puts a definitive end to 13 years of governing by the leftist Workers\u2019 Party, an era during which Brazil\u2019s economy boomed, lifting millions into the middle class and raising the country\u2019s profile on the global stage. ||||| Brazil's Senate Votes To Impeach Dilma Rousseff \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Ricardo Botelho/Brazil Photo Press/CON/LatinContent/Getty Images Ricardo Botelho/Brazil Photo Press/CON/LatinContent/Getty Images \n \n On Wednesday morning, Brazil's Senate voted to impeach suspended President Dilma Rousseff. Interim President Michel Temer was then sworn in as president. \n \n Sixty-one senators voted in favor of removing Rousseff from the presidency; 20 voted against her impeachment. \n \n Rousseff is accused of mishandling Brazil's budget and misrepresenting the state of the economy. Some of her accusers, as Rousseff noted in her testimony, are themselves accused or convicted of serious corruption charges. \n \n She testified for 14 hours straight on Monday, NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro reports. \n \n Rousseff defended her innocence and characterized the impeachment as a coup. \n \n Some 66 senators took the floor during the proceedings to question her or deliver speeches, in a marathon session that lasted through the night. \n \n Emotions ran high, Lulu reports: \"There was this surreal moment, where one of the prosecutors, Jenaina Paschoal, who was advocating Rousseff's impeachment \u2014 she burst into tears in her closing argument. She asked for Rousseff's forgiveness because she did not mean to cause Rousseff pain,\" Lulu says. \n \n \"She was not alone in her tears,\" Lulu says. \"The defense lawyer Jose Eduardo Cardozo also wept openly after giving his defense.\" \n \n Rousseff's impeachment was expected to bar her from office of any kind for the next eight years. But the Brazilian senate actually held a second vote on that issue, and \u2014 42 in favor, 36 against \u2014 failed to reach the necessary votes to pass the ban. That means Rousseff has the right to run for office again. \n \n Rousseff could, and likely will, appeal to Brazil's highest court, The Associated Press reports. \"But previous appeals during the process have failed,\" the wire service says. \n \n The suspended president has previously said that, if and when she's removed from office, she'll retire to her home in the city of Porto Alegre in southern Brazil, Lulu reports.",

The Brazilian senate voted 61-20 to impeach Rousseff, reports the BBC, covering the two-thirds majority needed.

Rousseff denies any wrongdoing and defended herself in front of the senate Monday, calling her ouster a coup. \"From the day after I was elected, several measures were taken to destabilize my government,\" she said. \"And you have been systematically making accusations against me.\" Acting president Michel Temer is scheduled to be sworn in Wednesday to finish Rousseff's term, which lasts through 2018. His center-right PMDB party ends 13 years in power by the left-wing Workers' Party. However, Temer's approval rating is as bad as Rousseff's, and the PMDB party is already beset by scandals. In fact, Temer's anticorruption minister recently resigned. Rousseff is likely to appeal the impeachment vote in court, though NPR reports she's unlikely to be successful. The senate voted 42-36 to allow her to run for office again, but Rousseff has previously said she'll retire to her hometown if successfully impeached.",

NPR reports that Rousseff will have the right to run for office again, though \"previous appeals during the process have failed,\" per the AP. She was suspended from office in May amid an impeachment trial for allegedly illegally borrowing money from state banks to pay for presidential expenses. During the trial, she testified for 14 hours in a row.",

(Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) \n \n Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel was behind the wheel of a truck that barreled into Bastille Day revelers and claimed 84 lives. (Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) \n \n With the arrest of three more suspects Sunday, French authorities are widening their investigation into the Bastille Day truck attack that killed 84 people in this French Riviera city to include potential accomplices of the man the Islamic State described as one of its warriors. \n \n French authorities arrested an Albanian man and woman who they believed supplied weapons to the 31-year-old attacker, Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel. Authorities also said Bouhlel, who has been described by family and friends as a troubled loner, had sent a text message saying \u201cBring more weapons\u201d to another suspected accomplice and had visited the scene of the attack days before the carnage. \n \n Late Sunday night, authorities announced that they had detained the man believed to be the recipient of the text message. Seven others had been detained earlier in connection with the Thursday attack. They included Bouhlel\u2019s ex-wife, but she was reportedly released from custody Sunday morning, according to authorities speaking to local media. \n \n Bouhlel, 31, was a \u201csoldier of the Islamic State,\u201d the militant group declared Saturday. French authorities said the Tunisian-born attacker was inspired by terrorist organizations. \n \n Twelve victims have not been identified, France\u2019s minister of health, Marisol Touraine, told reporters Sunday. A 6-month-old child was among 18 people still in critical condition in the hospital. \n \n The number of wounded rose to 256, according to the French prosecutor\u2019s office, with 85 still hospitalized. \n \n Bouhlel\u2019s text message was sent at 10:27 p.m. Thursday, roughly a half-hour before the attack on the landmark Promenade des Anglais, where tens of thousands had gathered to watch a Bastille Day fireworks display. The phone Bouhlel used, police said, was found inside the rented 19-ton refrigerated truck after he mowed down people for more than a mile and was killed in a shootout with police. \n \n French authorities on Sunday also provided more details that suggested the attack was carefully premeditated. \n \n Two days before the violence, security-camera footage showed Bouhlel driving the truck on the Promenade des Anglais, apparently staking it out, Jean-Michel Decugis, head of the judicial police department, told local media. He added that Bouhlel also emptied out his bank account, according to one of the suspects in custody. He was supposed to have returned the truck to the rental company the day before the attack. \n \n Investigators are also continuing to look into Bouhlel\u2019s possible path to radicalization. It remains unclear whether the Islamic State orchestrated the attack, inspired Bouhlel and was taking responsibility, or was seeking publicity despite having no direct influence. \n \n Thursday\u2019s attack was the third major terrorist assault in France in the past 18 months. In January 2015, militants targeted the offices of the Charlie Hebdo satirical newspaper in Paris, and on Nov. 13, gunmen launched a wave of attacks in the city, focusing on the Bataclan concert hall. A huge outpouring of solidarity and resilience followed those attacks. But in the aftermath of the carnage here, anger and resentment at the government have erupted over what many French describe as a failure of security to protect the Bastille Day celebrations. \n \n On Sunday, though, a sense of normality returned. Thousands of sunbathers flocked to the beaches of the Promenade des Anglais, sipping wine under blue umbrellas or windsurfing on the blue waters of the C\u00f4te D\u2019Azur. \n \n Read more: \n \n Anger in France over Nice attack focuses on apparently lax security \n \n One of the first victims of the Nice terror attack was a Muslim mother \n \n Two Americans among the dead in Nice attack \n \n Today\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world \n \n Annabell Van den Berghe contributed to this report.",

Just before the attack, according to reports, Bouhlel sent a text that read: \"Bring more weapons, bring five of them to C.\" In another text, he says: \"I've got the material.\" The latest people arrested were described as an \"Albanian couple,\" per the Telegraph. With the latest arrests, seven people have thus far been detained for having a possible link to the attack, the Washington Post reports, though Bouhlel's ex-wife was released Sunday. As authorities in France investigate the third major terror attack in that country in 18 months, additional details have emerged. French Prime Minister Manuel Valls tells a French newspaper, \"We now know that the killer was radicalized very quickly.\" The Los Angeles Times reports Bouhlel started frequenting a mosque just three months ago; prior to that, acquaintances say he did things that don't jibe with Muslim codes, like smoke pot and wear shorts. Footage from security cameras in Nice shows Bouhlel driving along the Promenade Des Anglais on the two days before the attack.

(Associated Press) \n \n Parents arrive to pick up their children from a nearby middle and elementary school after more then a dozen students were stabbed by a knife wielding suspect at Franklin Regional High School on Wednesday,... (Associated Press) \n \n At least five students were critically wounded, including a boy whose liver was pierced by a knife thrust that narrowly missed his heart and aorta, doctors said. Others also suffered deep abdominal puncture wounds. \n \n The rampage \u2014 which came after decades in which U.S. schools geared much of their emergency planning toward mass shootings, not stabbings \u2014 set off a screaming stampede, left blood on the floor and walls, and brought teachers rushing to help the victims. \n \n Police shed little light on the motive. \n \n The suspect, Alex Hribal, was taken into custody and treated for a minor hand wound, then was brought into court in shackles and a hospital gown and charged with four counts of attempted homicide and 21 counts of aggravated assault. He was jailed without bail, and authorities said he would be prosecuted as an adult. \n \n His attorney did not immediately respond to a message for comment. \n \n The attack unfolded in the morning just minutes before the start of classes at 1,200-student Franklin Regional High School, in an upper-middle-class area 15 miles east of Pittsburgh. It was over in about five minutes, during which the boy ran wildly down about 200 feet of hallway, slashing away with knives about 8 to 10 inches long, police said. \n \n Nate Moore, 15, said he saw the boy tackle and stab a freshman. He said he going to try to break it up when the boy got up and slashed his face, opening a wound that required 11 stitches. \n \n \"It was really fast. It felt like he hit me with a wet rag because I felt the blood splash on my face. It spurted up on my forehead,\" he said. \n \n The attacker \"had the same expression on his face that he has every day, which was the freakiest part,\" Moore said. \"He wasn't saying anything. He didn't have any anger on his face. It was just a blank expression.\" \n \n Assistant Principal Sam King finally tackled the boy and disarmed him, and a Murrysville police officer who is regularly assigned to the school handcuffed him, police said. \n \n King's son told The Associated Press that his father was treated at a hospital, though authorities have said he did not suffer any knife wounds. \n \n \"He says he's OK. He's a tough cookie and sometimes hides things, but I believe he's OK,\" Zack King said. He added: \"I'm proud of him.\" \n \n In addition to the 22 who were stabbed or slashed, two people suffered other injuries during the melee, authorities said. The security guard, who was wounded after intervening early in the melee, was treated and released. \n \n \"There are a number of heroes in this day. Many of them are students,\" Gov. Tom Corbett said in a visit to the stricken town. \"Students who stayed with their friends and didn't leave their friends.\" \n \n As for what set off the attack, Murrysville Police Chief Thomas Seefeld said investigators were looking into reports of a threatening phone call between the suspect and another student the night before. Seefeld didn't specify whether the suspect received or made the call. \n \n The FBI joined the investigation and went to the boy's house, where authorities said they planned to confiscate and search his computer. \n \n \"They are a very, very nice family. A great family. We never saw anything out of the ordinary,\" said John Kukalis, a next-door neighbor for about 13 years. \n \n His wife, Sonya Kukalis, said: \"It should be an eye-opener for everybody. Everyone always thinks it's the other neighborhood, the other town. We need to be kinder and show compassion to more people. Something must have been going on for him to do this.\" \n \n While several bloody stabbing rampages at schools in China have made headlines in the past few years, schools in the U.S. have concentrated their emergency preparations on shooting rampages. \n \n Nevertheless, there have been at least two major stabbing attacks at U.S. schools over the past year, one at a community college in Texas last April that wounded at least 14 people, and another, also in Texas, that killed a 17-year-old student and injured three others at a high school in September. \n \n On Wednesday, Mia Meixner, 16, said the rampage touched off a \"stampede of kids\" yelling, \"Run! Get out of here! Someone has a knife!\" \n \n The boy had a \"blank look,\" she said. \"He was just kind of looking like he always does, not smiling, not scowling or frowning.\" \n \n Meixner and Moore called the attacker a shy boy who largely kept to himself, but they said he was not an outcast and they had no reason to think he might be violent. \n \n \"He was never mean to anyone, and I never saw people be mean to him,\" Meixner said. \"I never saw him with a particular group of friends.\" \n \n Michael Float, 18, said he had just gotten to school when he saw \"blood all over the floor\" and smeared on the wall near the main entrance. Then he saw a wounded student. \n \n \"He had his shirt pulled up and he was screaming, 'Help! Help!'\" Float said. \"He had a stab wound right at the top right of his stomach, blood pouring down.\" \n \n Float said he saw a teacher applying pressure to the wound of another student. \n \n About five minutes elapsed between the time the campus police officer summoned help over the radio at 7:13 a.m. and the boy was disarmed, the police chief said. \n \n Someone, possibly a student, pulled a fire alarm during the attack, Seefeld said. Although that created chaos, the police chief said, it emptied out the school more quickly, and \"that was a good thing that that was done.\" \n \n Also, a girl with \"an amazing amount of composure\" applied pressure to a schoolmate's wounds and probably kept the victim from bleeding to death, said Dr. Mark Rubino at Forbes Regional Medical Center. \n \n Public safety and school officials said an emergency plan worked as well as could be expected. The district conducted an emergency exercise three months ago and a full-scale drill about a year ago. \n \n \"We haven't lost a life, and I think that's what we have to keep in mind,\" said county public safety spokesman Dan Stevens. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Mike Rubinkam in Allentown and Jesse Washington in Murrysville, Pa., and AP news researchers Judith Ausuebel and Barbara Sambriski contributed to this report. ||||| Story highlights The DA says 4 people are in critical condition, including one who was \"eviscerated\" \n \n Alex Hribal, 16, faces 4 counts of attempted homicide, 21 counts of aggravated assault \n \n Teachers use students' hoodies as tourniquets on injured teens, student says \n \n An assistant principal tackled the accused attacker, authorities say \n \n A teenage boy wielding two kitchen knives went on a stabbing rampage at his high school in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, early Wednesday, before being tackled by an assistant principal, authorities said. \n \n Twenty students and a security officer at Franklin Regional Senior High School were either stabbed or slashed in the attack, Westmoreland County District Attorney John Peck told reporters. \n \n The accused attacker was been identified as 16-year-old Alex Hribal, according to a criminal complaint made public. Hribal, who was arraigned as an adult, faces four counts of attempted homicide, 21 counts of aggravated assault and one count of possession of a weapon on school grounds, the documents show. \n \n \"I'm not sure he knows what he did, quite frankly,\" Hribal's attorney, Patrick Thomassey, said, adding he would file a motion to move the case to juvenile court. \n \n \"...We have to make sure that he understands the nature of the charges and what's going on here. It's important that he be examined by a psychiatrist and determined where he is mentally.\" \n \n A doctor who treated six of the victims, primarily teens, said at first they did not know they had been stabbed. \n \n \"They just felt pain and noticed they were bleeding,\" Dr. Timothy VanFleet, chief of emergency medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, told CNN. \n \n \"Almost all of them said they didn't see anyone coming at them. It apparently was a crowded hallway and they were going about their business, and then just felt pain and started bleeding.\" \n \n Arguing against bail for Hribal, the district attorney told the court that four of the victims were in critical condition, including one who was \"eviscerated.\" There's a question whether the victim will survive, Peck said. \n \n Hribal is being held without bail at the Westmoreland County juvenile detention center. \n \n Authorities have not detailed a possible motive in the attack, but the district attorney said in court the teen made \"statements when subdued by officials that he wanted to die.\" \n \n 'Don't know what I got going down' \n \n The carnage began shortly before the start of classes, when an attacker began stabbing students in a crowded hallway and then went from classroom to classroom. \n \n Student Matt DeCesare was outside the school when he heard a fire alarm ring and then saw two students come out of the school covered in blood. \n \n Then he saw teachers running into the building and pulling \"a couple of more students out,\" he told CNN. The students had been stabbed. \n \n To stanch the bleeding, the teachers asked the students for their hoodies. \n \n \"We all took our hoodies off and handed them to the teachers to use as tourniquets to stop the bleeding,\" he said. \n \n Recordings of emergency calls released in the wake of the attack provide a soundtrack of sorts to the terror and chaos that played out inside the school. \n \n \"I don't know what I got going down at school here but I need some units here ASAP,\" one officer can be heard saying. \n \n Minutes later in another call, another official, breathlessly, can be heard detailing casualties: \"About 14 patients right now.\" \n \n Then another call for help. \"Be advised inside the school we have multiple stab victims,\" one of the officers said. \"So bring in EMS from wherever you can get them. \n \n 'Saw the kid who was stabbing people' \n \n Student Mia Meixner was standing at her locker. \n \n \"I heard a big commotion like behind my back,\" she told CNN. \"And I turned around and I saw two kids on the ground.\" \n \n She thought a fight had broken out, but then she saw blood. \n \n \"I saw the kid who was stabbing people get up and run away,\" she said. \n \n Then she saw a girl she knew standing by the cafeteria. \"She was gushing blood down her arm.\" \n \n Meixner dropped her books and went to help the girl. \n \n \"I started hearing a stampede of students coming down from the other end of the hall, saying 'Get out, we need to leave, go, there's a kid with a knife.' Then a teacher came over to me and the girl I was trying to help. And she said she would handle the girl and that I should run out. So then I just ran out of the school and tried to get out as soon as possible.\" \n \n Meixner never heard the attacker utter a word. \n \n \"He was very quiet. He just was kind of doing it,\" she said. \"And he had this, like, look on his face that he was just crazy and he was just running around just stabbing whoever was in his way.\" \n \n She said she didn't know the boy, but he had been in a lot of her classes. \"He kept to himself a lot,\" she said. \"He didn't have that many friends that I know of, but I also don't know of him getting bullied that much. I actually never heard of him getting bullied. He just was kind of shy and didn't talk to many people.\" \n \n Hribal's attorney described him as a \"nice young man,\" who has never been in trouble. \n \n \"He's not a loner. He works well with other kids,\" he said. \"...He's scared. He's a young kid. He's 16, looks like he's 12. I mean, he's a very young kid and he's never been in trouble so this is all new to him.\" \n \n At least a dozen FBI agents could be seen going in and out of Hribal's family home in the hours after the attack. Shortly before the agents arrived at the house, a man believed to be Hribal's father drove up. \n \n \"My prayers go out to everyone who was injured today, and I hope they recover as soon as possible,\" he told reporters. \n \n Hribal's attorney said the family was upset by the allegations. \"They did not foresee this at all,\" he said. \n \n Tackled by an assistant principal \n \n Assistant Principal Sam King is being credited with bringing to an end the 5-minute rampage that authorities say began about 7:15 a.m. ET. \n \n King tackled the teen, Peck told reporters. A school resource officer was able to handcuff the suspect, Police Chief Thomas Seefeld said. \n \n The accused teen was being treated for injuries to his hands, the chief said. \n \n Police Officer William \"Buzz\" Yakshe, who also serves as a resource officer at the school, helped subdue the suspect, said Dan Stevens, the county deputy emergency management coordinator. Yakshe is \"doing fine,\" Stevens said. \"He's more upset than anything else over what happened, because these are his kids.\" \n \n A fire alarm that was pulled during the attack probably helped get more people out of the school during an evacuation order, Seefeld said. Students were running everywhere and there was \"chaos and panic.\" \n \n JUST WATCHED Students stabbed at Pennsylvania school Replay More Videos ...

The injuries were stabbing-related, such as lacerations or punctures, he said. \n \n 'It doesn't happen here' \n \n The attack in Murrysville is the latest in a string of school violence that has occurred across the nation. But mass stabbings, such as the one at the high school, are rare. \n \n The attack has rattled the town, a residential enclave with a population of about 20,000. \n \n A message on the Franklin Regional School District's website said all of its elementary schools were closed after the incident, and \"the middle school and high school students are secure.\" \n \n Franklin Regional Senior High will be closed \"over the next several days,\" district school Superintendent Gennaro Piraino said. The district's middle school and elementary schools will be open Thursday, and counseling will be available for the whole district, he said. \n \n Information on what led to the stabbings and the conditions of the injured are still unfolding. \n \n Bill Rehkopf, a KDKA radio host and Franklin Regional High School graduate, called the stabbing shocking. \n \n He said he kept thinking, \"It doesn't happen here, it can't happen here.\"",

The suspect is 16-year-old Alex Hribal, and he has been charged as an adult with four counts of attempted homicide and 21 counts of aggravated assault. The motive remains unclear, but the AP says police are investigating reports of a threatening phone call between Hribal and another student last night. It wasn't clear which of the two made the call. The accounts of exactly what happened at Franklin Regional High School in Murrysville are still unfolding, but authorities say assistant principal Sam King and a security guard at the school tackled and subdued the attacker in a hallway. Some other details emerging: The attack began in a classroom when Hribal pulled out two 8-inch kitchen knives and began slashing students, reports the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. He reportedly followed them as they fled into the hallway and stabbed others as he ran. During the assault, the attacker \"was very quiet,\" student Mia Meixner tells CNN. \"He just was kind of doing it. And he had this, like, look on his face that he was just crazy and he was just running around just stabbing whoever was in his way.\" A doctor at a nearby hospital said a female student with \"an amazing amount of composure\" likely saved the life of one of the more seriously injured male students by applying pressure to his wounds. That appears to be junior Gracie Evans, who recounts to the Pittsburgh newspaper: \"My friend was on his stomach, and the other kid who was severely injured was told to sit up. I knew that wasn't right. I said to a few students, we need pressure on this wound, and they gave me some paper towels, and I held pressure on that wound for about 10 minutes.\" Authorities say 22 people were stabbed or slashed, all but one of them students, and two more students suffered other injuries in the chaos.",

The text reads: 'In silent sympathy.' \n \n Students embrace in front of lit candles outside the Josef-Koenig-Gymnasium high school in Haltern am See, March, 24, 2015. \n \n HALTERN AM SEE, Germany Students and teachers at a small-town German high school broke down in tears once they realized that 16 classmates and two teachers were on board an ill-fated Germanwings airplane that crashed in France on Tuesday on a flight to Duesseldorf. \n \n The 10th grade students from the Joseph-Koenig-Gymnasium high school were on their way home after a week-long Spanish exchange program at the Institut Giola in Llinars del Vall\u00e8s near Barcelona. It was a reciprocal visit after 12 Spanish students had spent a week at their school in December. \n \n \"It was a Spanish language exchange program and they were flying home after having what was probably the most wonderful time of their lives,\" said Sylvia Loehrmann, the education minister for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. \n \n \"It's so tragic, so sad, so unfathomable,\" she said. Most of the students were about 15 years old. \n \n The Airbus operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline crashed in the French Alps, killing all 150 on board. Germanwings confirmed its flight from Barcelona to Duesseldorf went down with 144 passengers and six crew. \n \n Haltern am See mayor Bodo Klimpel said that word spread quickly through the school about reports that a plane from Barcelona had gone missing and the students began researching on their own to try to find out more about the plane's fate. \n \n \"And then when the plane didn't land and they were unable to make contact with their friends and classmates by cell phone, that's when they assumed the worst had happened,\" said the mayor, who was also fighting off tears at a news conference. \n \n \"The students were informed that there was a sufficient probability that the plane would not be landing in Duesseldorf,\" Klimpel said. \"Classes were then called off.\" \n \n CANDLES AND TEARS \n \n The students were sent home but many returned in the afternoon with candles in their hands and tears in their eyes to mourn with each other at the school. \n \n \"It's the darkest day in this town's history,\" said Klimpel, who added some parents nevertheless drove to the airport and some to the school. \"We're in a state of shock. It's the worst thing ever imaginable.\" \n \n He said the school would be opened on Wednesday but there wouldn't be any normal lessons. \"It'll be a chance for the students to talk about the horrible thing that happened.\" \n \n The town lies about 30 km (20 miles) to the north of Dortmund and Gelsenkirchen - homes of two major German soccer clubs and former mining towns. It is 50 km (30 miles) north of Duesseldorf. \n \n Haltern am See's history dates back to 1289 and perhaps its most famous son in soccer player Christoph Metzelder, a former Germany defender who also played for Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid. Germany defender Benedikt Hoewedes, who plays for Gelsenkirchen's Schalke 04 club, is also from Haltern am See. \n \n The nearby Sixtus church and another local church opened their doors for students, teachers and local residents to mourn and flags in the town of 37,000 that lies just north of the Ruhr River Valley industrial area were lowered to half-mast. \n \n The mayor of the Spanish town Llinars del Valles, Marti Pujol, told Reuters that these kinds of exchanges had been organized for several years with German towns including in the Duesseldorf, Cologne and Hamburg areas. Spanish children had spent a week in December in Haltern am See with German families. \n \n \"The whole village is distraught, Pujol said of his town with 9,000 residents. \"The families knew each other... The parents had been to see them off at 6 this morning.\" \n \n (Additional reporting by Sarah White in Madrid; Writing by Erik Kirschbaum in Berlin; Editing by Giles Elgood) ||||| SEYNE-LES-ALPES, France (AP) \u2014 A black box recovered from the scene and pulverized pieces of debris strewn across Alpine mountainsides held clues to what caused a German jetliner to take an unexplained eight-minute dive Tuesday midway through a flight from Spain to Germany, apparently killing all 150 people on board. \n \n Debris of the Germanwings passenger jet is scattered on the mountain side near Seyne les Alpes, French Alps, Tuesday, March 24, 2015.

A Germanwings passenger... (Associated Press) \n \n The victims included two babies, two opera singers and 16 German high school students and their teachers returning from an exchange trip to Spain. It was the deadliest crash in France in decades. \n \n The Airbus A320 operated by Germanwings, a budget subsidiary of Lufthansa, was less than an hour from landing in Duesseldorf on a flight from Barcelona when it unexpectedly went into a rapid descent. The pilots sent out no distress call and had lost radio contact with their control center, France's aviation authority said, deepening the mystery. \n \n While investigators searched through debris from Flight 9525 on steep and desolate slopes, families across Europe reeled with shock and grief. Sobbing relatives at both airports were led away by airport workers and crisis counselors. \n \n \"The site is a picture of horror. The grief of the families and friends is immeasurable,\" German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said after being flown over the crash scene. \"We must now stand together. We are united in our great grief.\" \n \n It took investigators hours to reach the site, led by mountain guides to the craggy ravine in the southern French Alps, not far from the Italian border and the French Riviera. \n \n Video shot from a helicopter and aired by BFM TV showed rescuers walking in the crevices of a rocky mountainside scattered with plane parts. Photos of the crash site showed white flecks of debris across a mountain and larger airplane body sections with windows. A helicopter crew that landed briefly in the area saw no signs of life, French officials said. \n \n \"Everything is pulverized. The largest pieces of debris are the size of a small car. No one can access the site from the ground,\" Gilbert Sauvan, president of the general council, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, told The Associated Press. \n \n \"This is pretty much the worst thing you can imagine,\" said Bodo Klimpel, mayor of the German town of Haltern, rent with sorrow after losing 16 tenth graders and their two teachers. \n \n The White House and the airline chief said there was no sign that terrorism was involved, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel urged reporters not to speculate on the cause. \n \n \"We still don't know much beyond the bare information on the flight, and there should be no speculation on the cause of the crash,\" she said in Berlin. \"All that will be investigated thoroughly.\" \n \n Lufthansa Vice President Heike Birlenbach told reporters in Barcelona that for now \"we say it is an accident.\" \n \n In Washington, the White House said American officials were in contact with their French, Spanish and German counterparts. \"There is no indication of a nexus to terrorism at this time,\" said U.S. National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan. \n \n Merkel, French President Francois Hollande and Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy were to visit the site Wednesday. \n \n French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said a black box had been located at the crash site and \"will be immediately investigated.\" He did not say whether it was the flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder. \n \n The two devices \u2014 actually orange boxes designed to survive extreme heat and pressure \u2014 should provide investigators with a second-by-second timeline of the plane's flight. \n \n The voice recorder takes audio feeds from four microphones within the cockpit and records all the conversations between the pilots, air traffic controllers as well as any noises heard in the cockpit. The flight data recorder captures 25 hours' worth of information on the position and condition of almost every major part in a plane. \n \n Germanwings is low-cost carrier owned by Lufthansa, Germany's biggest airline, and serves mostly European destinations. Tuesday's crash was its first involving passenger deaths since it began operating in 2002. The Germanwings logo, normally maroon and yellow, was blacked out on its Twitter feed. \n \n Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr called it the \"blackest day of our company's 60-year history.\" He insisted, however, that flying \"remains after this terrible day the safest mode of transport.\" \n \n Germanwings said 144 passengers and six crew members were on board. Authorities said 67 Germans were believed among the victims, including the 16 high school students and two opera singers, as well as many Spaniards, two Australians and one person each from the Netherlands, Turkey and Denmark. \n \n Contralto Maria Radner was returning to Germany with her husband and baby after performing in Wagner's \"Siegfried,\" according to Barcelona's Gran Teatre del Liceu. Bass baritone Oleg Bryjak had appeared in the same opera, according to the opera house in Duesseldorf. \n \n The plane left Barcelona Airport at 10:01 a.m. and had reached its cruising height of 38,000 feet when it suddenly went into an eight-minute descent to just over 6,000 feet, Germanwings CEO Thomas Winkelmann told reporters in Cologne. \n \n \"We cannot say at the moment why our colleague went into the descent, and so quickly, and without previously consulting air traffic control,\" said Germanwings' director of flight operations, Stefan-Kenan Scheib. \n \n At 10:30, the plane lost radio contact with the control center but \"never declared a distress alert,\" Eric Heraud of the French Civil Aviation Authority told the AP. \n \n The plane crashed at an altitude of about 6,550 feet (2,000 meters) at Meolans-Revels, near the popular ski resort of Pra Loup. The site is 430 miles (700 kilometers) south-southeast of Paris. \n \n \"It was a deafening noise. I thought it was an avalanche, although it sounded slightly different. It was short noise and lasted just a few seconds,\" Sandrine Boisse, the president of the Pra Loup tourism office, told the AP. \n \n Authorities faced a long and difficult search-and-recovery operation because of the area's remoteness. The weather, which had been clear earlier in the day, deteriorated Tuesday afternoon, with a chilly rain falling. Snow coated nearby mountaintops. \n \n French Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet said the crash site covered several acres, with thousands of pieces of debris, \"which leads us to think the impact must have been extremely violent at very high speed.\" \n \n Search operations were suspended overnight and were to resume at daybreak, though about 10 gendarmes remained in the desolate ravine to guard the crash site, authorities said. \n \n Winkelmann said the pilot, whom he did not name, had more than 10 years' experience working for Germanwings and its parent airline Lufthansa. \n \n Florian Graenzdoerffer Lufthansa Spokesman for North Rhine Westphalia said the company had to cancel seven flights out of Dusseldorf because a number of crew members felt they were unfit to fly following news of the accident. \n \n \"I can't tell you any details because this is a personal decision and in our business we have an agreement if a crew feels unfit to fly ... then we respect this,\" Graenzdoerffer said. \n \n The aircraft was delivered to Lufthansa in 1991, had approximately 58,300 flight hours in some 46,700 flights, Airbus said. The plane underwent a routine check in Duesseldorf on Monday, and its last regular full check took place in the summer of 2013. \n \n The A320 plane is a workhorse of modern aviation, with a good safety record. \n \n The last time a passenger jet crashed in France was the 2000 Concorde accident, which left 113 dead. \n \n ___ \n \n Charlton reported from Paris.

(Associated Press) \n \n SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 Robin Williams' suicide seared into the world's collective mindset more than anything else this year, based on what people were searching for on Google. \n \n The reaction to Williams' death in August topped Google's list of 2014's fastest-rising search requests. It beat notable events such as the World Cup, the Ebola outbreak, the March disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and the Ice Bucket Challenge, an Internet video craze to raise awareness and money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's Disease. \n \n Other topics of worldwide intrigue on Google included the addictive smartphone game \"Flappy Bird,\" bearded drag queen Conchita Wurst, the Middle East extremist group ISIS, the hit Disney movie \"Frozen,\" and the Winter Olympics in Russia. \n \n Williams, Ebola, the World Cup and the Ice Bucket also ranked among the most-discussed subjects this year on Facebook, which released its list last week. Google released its list Tuesday. \n \n Williams' death drove many people to reminisce about his career highlights. In the first few days after his suicide, there was a six-fold increase in the number of Google searches for \"carpe diem\" \u2014 a Latin phrase for \"seize the day\" that Williams popularized in the film \"Dead Poets Society.\" Reports about Williams' long-running battle with depression caused searches for that term to triple. There was also a flurry of searches about his movies (the top five were: \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" ''Dead Poets Society,\" ''Good Will Hunting,\" ''Jumanji\" and \"Patch Adams.\") \n \n Google's worldwide list of the year's hottest search requests mirrored the activity in the U.S. with a few exceptions. Wurst didn't make the Top 10 list in the U.S., nor did the Winter Olympics. Instead, Web surfers in the U.S. were seeking more information about the August confrontation that culminated in a white policeman shooting and killing Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Ukraine's conflict with Russia also held more intrigue in the U.S. than the rest of the world. \n \n Google's review follows annual roundups compiled during the previous two weeks by its main search rivals. Although Google's list usually comes last each year, its rankings typically provide more telling insights into what people were thinking because the company's technology processes about two out of every three search requests made on the Internet. \n \n Yahoo's search lists indicated that its websites tend to attract entertainment-minded people. While Ebola topped Yahoo's rankings for 2014, celebrities or entertainers occupied six of the other slots. They were singer Ariana Grande (No. 3), actress Jennifer Lawrence (No. 4), actress Kaley Cuoco (No. 5), reality TV star Kim Kardashian (No. 6), singer Miley Cyrus (No. 8) and actress Jennifer Aniston (No. 10). Yahoo's list was rounded out by: the video game \"Minecraft,\" whose popularity prompted Microsoft to buy it for $2.5 billion earlier this year; \"Frozen\" and Apple's latest gadget, the iPhone 6. \n \n Instead of doing a wide-ranging compilation of top searches, Microsoft's Bing separated its lists into disparate categories, such as athletes (NBA star LeBron James soared the highest), celebrities (Kardashian reigned), vacation destinations (Costa Rica) and musicians (Beyonce).",

But now the Web has also attracted the attention of stars who have all the freedom and attention they need. Tom Hanks went online this week to launch Electric City, his so-far pulpy and enigmatic dystopian animation series. And Thursday night, Jerry Seinfeld premiered his series of webisodes, Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, about, well, that. \n \n Let us be clear: Jerry Seinfeld does not need the Web. Seinfeld could walk into any major broadcast network today, say he wanted to make a new show about, say, vacuum cleaner repair, and executives, after fainting, would rush to get the checkbook lest he change his mind. Jerry Seinfeld, let me remind you, got NBC to make The Marriage Ref. \n \n Seinfeld does not need the Web, but that doesn\u2019t mean that the Web might not, in many ways, be better suited to what he wants to do now: drive around, have some coffee and talk to his comedian buddies about comedy, while you watch. \n \n (MORE: Online Blockbuster?: Tom Hanks\u2019 Electric City Debuts on Yahoo) \n \n That\u2019s pretty much what there is to Comedians in Cars\u2014available at Crackle and the series\u2019 own website\u2014in which Seinfeld\u2019s first guest is Larry David, co-creator of the Seinfeld sitcom. Well, no: his first guest is his antique 1952 VW Beetle, a gorgeous collectors\u2019 item that Seinfeld described lovingly but with a dry observation about its meekness: \u201cIf, like me, you feel that true humility is always in short supply, this is the car for you.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s a curious statement to introduce the series with, since there is something arguably\u2026 un-humble about making a show, the premise of which is showing off your fantastic car collection en route to picking up your old collaborator and reminding us of one of the greatest triumphs in TV history. But it\u2019s never not interesting to get the Beatles back together, and when David slides into the car, the observations start flying: about David\u2019s fussy dietary habits, about the car\u2019s peculiar (and awesome!) \u201csemaphore\u201d style turn flags, about the etiquette of ordering tea when your companion is having coffee. \n \n There\u2019s something appealing about the idea of Seinfeld, a guy who could command the legions of Hollywood at the slightest command, deciding instead that he already has a pretty good life, opting to do low-stakes comedy and schmooze with his pals in a state of semi-retirement. It\u2019s fun, and it can be intriguing, especially when David and he get not just to making jokes, but to discussing, in a sidelong way, how and why jokes work. \n \n Toward the end, they talk about why David would opt to smoke a cigar rather than a cigarette when working on Seinfeld and ruminating on the show. Trying to get at the difference, David pantomimes the act of smoking both: a cigarette is fast and nervous (he mimes sucking at his fingers tetchily), while a cigar is contemplative (he takes a slow, thoughtful fake drag). \u201cA cigar takes time!\u201d Jerry pipes in, in what could either be a documentary conversation moment or a scripted exchange from the show Seinfeld. \n \n (MORE: Issa Rae of Awkward Black Girl on the Future of the Web Series) \n \n The show feels it\u2019s meant to be casual and spur-of-the-moment, but it sure doesn\u2019t look that way. The video is crisp, rich looking and edited within an inch of its life. It cuts quickly, every second or few, to a different perspective on the comedians, to a luxurious-looking crema on a cup of coffee, to a detail on the car or a plate of pancake. Seinfeld has put as much meticulous energy into making a casual conversation look highly produced as David, with Curb Your Enthusiasm, puts into making a highly planned operation look utterly casual. \n \n The whole aesthetic is a little distancing, and it gives the show a feel of watching a 13 1/2-minute long commercial. But for what? Just for how good a time these guys are having, being themselves, being with each other, having coffee and breakfast at God knows what hour in the day. \n \n \u201cYou continue to have one of the finest minds I\u2019ve ever met,\u201d Seinfeld tells David, earnestly, after the cigar analysis. \u201cYou know I take that as a great compliment,\u201d returns David warmly. Adds Seinfeld: \u201cHere\u2019s an analysis of something by two idiots that no one else is doing.\u201d Aren\u2019t they? Or maybe they are, in diners and on YouTube channels, and simply not issuing highly produced and promoted video of their doing it. \n \n Regardless, talent is talent, and I can\u2019t blame Seinfeld and David for knowing and acknowledging how much they have. But by the end of that exchange, it feels like we\u2019ve receded away as viewers rather than having been brought into their intimate circle; I feel like I should ask if anyone needs me to freshen up their coffee or if I should just clear the table. \n \n None of which is to argue that they\u2019re not right: these guys really are the Lennon-McCartney of comedy, and still it\u2019s intriguing and fun in any format to watch them get together and jam. If you\u2019re not interested\u2014well, no harm, no foul is the attitude of this webisode. Jerry Seinfeld doesn\u2019t need the Web, he doesn\u2019t need TV either, and if you find other ways to spend your time than with him, his coffee and his cars, he\u2019ll do just fine. ||||| Hollywood types and TV observers are fond of bemoaning that there\u2019s no such thing anymore as a Seinfeld-style megahit \u2014 the culture has become far too fractured for 35 million people to agree to tune into anything on network television at the same time (save events like the Oscars and the Super Bowl). But watching the first episode of Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s new web series on Crackle Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, I began to spin a highly speculative What If in my head: Had Seinfeld wanted to make Seinfeld in 2012 instead of 1990, would he have made 22-minute episodes for TV? Or 13-minute episodes for the Web? \n \n Given how much fun he seems to be having here, and how much fun I had watching it, I suspect it would\u2019ve been the latter. CICGC\u2018s first episode features Seinfeld picking up his Seinfeld co-conspirator Larry David in a 1952 azure blue Volkswagen Bug, and taking him out for coffee and breakfast at the Los Angeles diner John O\u2019Groats. To a light, jazzy underscore, the two old friends proceed to dither and debate over day-to-day minutiae like the contemplative power of cigars over cigarettes, the freeing quality of boxer briefs over standard briefs, and David\u2019s fastidious dietary philosophy. They occasionally graze past weightier topics \u2014 David reveals that his decision to stop drinking coffee helped lead to his divorce \u2014 but for the most part, the episode feels like Seinfeld boiled down to its essential spirit: Highly entertaining talk about the trivialities of life, with no silly \u201cplot\u201d to get in the way. David pretty much says as much to Seinfeld at the end of their meal: \u201cYou\u2019ve finally made a show about nothing.\u201d \n \n Check out the full episode below: \n \n There\u2019s a real pleasure in watching good friends enjoy each other\u2019s company so deeply, but it will be interesting to see how this web series develops when Seinfeld is hanging out with someone he\u2019s known for far less time, like Ricky Gervais.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| \"You have finally done the show about nothing.\" So proclaims Larry David during the first episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, Jerry Seinfeld's return to the comedy treadmill after an absence spanning a little over a decade. \n \n The show, which launched on Thursday, follows a basic format: each episode will see Seinfeld pick up a chum in a vintage car, then drive to a restaurant for a hot drink and perhaps a snack. Cameras follow them, fly-on-the-wall style. They talk. Hilarity ensues. \n \n Next week, the show will co-star Ricky Gervais; later in the season, Alec Baldwin. If you're a fan of Seinfeld, or its awkward stepchild Curb Your Enthusiasm, you'll be charmed. If not, you may find things meander. For better, or worse, the 15-minute show seems to be unscripted. \n \n There is, of course, a ring of familiarity about this. In fact, judging by the first episode (all others are top secret for now), Seinfeld might almost be accused of stealing the format of his \"show about nothing\". \n \n How so? Well the car journey portion, filmed with Go-Pro dashboard cameras, is essentially a rip-off of Robert Llewellyn's series Carpool. The restaurant scenes recall Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan's semi-improvised gastronomic travel documentary The Trip. At times, the resemblance is positively eerie. \n \n For all that, there's at least a whiff of innovation about Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. It's nothing to do with the format, or punch lines, but revolves around the way people are supposed to view it. Put simply: it's a TV show you can't see on TV; it can only be watched over the internet. \n \n Seinfeld's decision to forgo television \u2013 in favour of Crackle.com, a Sony-owned site \u2013 comes at a watershed moment for television's relationship with the internet. For years pigeon-holed as an experimental medium, used mostly for discovering fresh talent, online TV projects are now attracting blue-chip Hollywood stars. Tom Hanks launched his new project \u2013 a dystopian science-fiction animation called Electric City that he created and voices \u2013 via Yahoo. And the veteran TV anchor Larry King announced he was coming out of retirement to launch a weekly chat-show on Hulu. Netflix is venturing into TV production, with shows such as Lillehammer and Arrested Development, while Will Ferrell these days seems to spend most of his time online in Funny or Die sketches. \n \n The online trend is partly driven by money, since the web accounts for a growing portion of overall ad spending, and partly by changing viewer habits, since the growing ubiquity of smartphones and tablet computers helps draw eyeballs to digital programming from traditional media. \n \n But the Hankses and Seinfelds of this world, who have enough money for this lifetime, appear to also be drawn to the internet for artistic reasons. It allows them to experiment creatively without having to worry about interfering network executives, clunky TV timeslots, spiralling budgets and the other Hollywood blights. \n \n \"When I work with established TV stars, they're often interested by the freedom the internet provides,\" says Justin Gayner, the founder of ChannelFlip, a British online TV network that has made shows with Harry Hill, David Mitchell, and Richard Hammond. \"The bigger the star, the more confident they are to experiment online. If they have conquered the Everest of TV then the internet is a new mountain. And the spontaneity of it all seems to remind them of their roots in stand-up comedy.\" \n \n Seinfeld, then, is returning to comedy so he can play around. Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee is primarily a show about wasting time. (As David observes, early in the debut episode, \"nobody can waste time like you and me\".) And what is the internet, if not the perfect medium for wasting time?",

There's no indication that was the case. \n \n Papadopoulos' April 2016 conversation with an Australian diplomat indicating the Russians had so-called dirt on Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton reportedly started the FBI investigation that has led to special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into whether Trump campaign officials colluded with the Russian government during a Kremlin campaign to meddle in the 2016 election. \n \n Trump added that the truth about the alleged FBI informant could only come out with \"the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also, Senate Judiciary) is asking for.\" \n \n Congressional Republicans have engaged in an intense fight with the Justice Department over access to highly sensitive and classified information about the investigation into the Trump campaign, and the identity of the FBI's informant, and have routinely expressed frustration with DOJ's refusals to grant access to the documents. \n \n House Freedom Caucus co-founder Rep.

Trump's tweet followed reports that an FBI informant had talked to Trump campaign advisers with alleged links to Russia, which the president called a \"really big deal\" in a tweet Saturday, Politico reports.

    "document": "Washington (CNN) Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's well-known candor was on display in her chambers late Monday, when she declined to retreat from her earlier criticism of Donald Trump and even elaborated on it. \n \n \"He is a faker,\" she said of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, going point by point, as if presenting a legal brief. \"He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego. ... How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns? The press seems to be very gentle with him on that.\" \n \n Ginsburg's comments came in a previously scheduled interview related to my research for a book on Chief Justice John Roberts. I took a detour to raise the reverberations from her criticism of Trump to The Associated Press and The New York Times in recent interviews. \"I can't imagine what this place would be -- I can't imagine what the country would be -- with Donald Trump as our president,\" she had said in the Times interview published Monday. \n \n Trump responded Wednesday morning by calling on Ginsburg to resign. \n \n \"Justice Ginsburg of the U.S. Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.

The 83-year-old justice expressed no regret on Monday for the comments or surprise that she would be criticized. Any disbelief she expressed stemmed from the fact that Trump has gotten so far in the election cycle. \n \n \"At first I thought it was funny,\" she said of Trump's early candidacy. \"To think that there's a possibility that he could be president ... \" Her voice trailed off gloomily. \n \n \"I think he has gotten so much free publicity,\" she added, drawing a contrast between what she believes is tougher media treatment of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and returning to an overriding complaint: \"Every other presidential candidate has turned over tax returns.\" \n \n Ginsburg was appointed to the high court by President Bill Clinton in 1993, and is now the senior member of the liberal wing and leading voice countering conservative Chief Justice Roberts.

Over the course of several interviews, the justice has spent the last few days hammering Donald Trump for his reckless campaign and outrageous policies, suggesting that a President Trump would pose a serious danger to the republic. Her explicitly political statements set off a familiar firestorm about whether Ginsburg had \u201ccrossed the line,\u201d sending the conservative blogosphere in particular into howling fantods. Critics on the left and right have criticized Ginsburg\u2019s comments as explosive, unprecedented, and unethical. \n \n Mark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern covers courts and the law for Slate. \n \n They are. That\u2019s the point. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n To recap the controversy, Ginsburg\u2019s campaign began with a light jab at Trump in a Thursday interview, in which the justice admitted she didn\u2019t \u201cwant to think about\u201d the possibility of a Trump presidency. Then, on Friday, Ginsburg told the New York Times\u2019 Adam Liptak, \u201cI can\u2019t imagine what this place would be\u2014I can\u2019t imagine what the country would be\u2014with Donald Trump as our president.\u201d Days after her Times interview, Ginsburg told CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic that Trump is a \u201cfaker\u201d with \u201cno consistency\u201d and she criticized his refusal to release his tax returns. \u201cHe really has an ego,\u201d she said (correctly and understatedly). \n \n There is really very little to debate about the ethics of Ginsburg\u2019s comments. They were plainly a violation, the kind of partisan partiality that judicial ethics codes strive to prevent. But Ginsburg, who is a quietly canny judicial and political strategist, surely knows that her comments were an ethical error. That leads to a fascinating question: Why would the justice risk her reputation and good standing\u2014and even her power to hear cases involving Trump\u2014for a few quick jabs at the candidate? The answer, I suspect, is that Ginsburg has decided to sacrifice some of her prestige in order to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can. The subtext of Ginsburg\u2019s comments, of her willingness to comment, is that Trump poses an unparalleled threat to this country\u2014a threat so great that she will abandon judicial propriety in order to warn against looming disaster. \n \n To be clear, what Ginsburg is doing right now\u2014pushing her case against Trump through on-the-record interviews\u2014is not just unethical; it\u2019s dangerous. As a general rule, justices should refrain from commenting on politics, period. That dictate applies to 83-year-old internet folk heroes as strictly as it applies to anybody else who dons judicial robes. The independence of our judiciary\u2014and just as critically, its appearance of impartiality\u2014hinges on a consistent separation between itself and the other branches of government. That means no proclamations of loyalty to any candidate, or admissions of distaste of any other. \n \n Ginsburg\u2019s comments also set a dark precedent for other justices with equally strong political inclinations. \n \n You don\u2019t need to be a judicial ethicist to see the wisdom of this principle. Trump is a litigious man; should he take a campaign-related lawsuit to the court, Ginsburg will now surely be pressed to recuse herself. And of course, more significantly, these calls for recusal would accompany every case involving a possible Trump administration. (Through the Department of Justice, the executive branch is tasked with defending federal laws and presidential actions in court.) Moreover, Ginsburg\u2019s comments all but begged Trump to respond\u2014which he did on Tuesday, with a surprisingly coherent rebuke. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n \u201cI think it\u2019s highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly,\u201d Trump told the New York Times. \u201cI think it\u2019s a disgrace to the court and I think she should apologize to the court. I couldn\u2019t believe it when I saw it. \u2026 It\u2019s so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that. It only energizes my base even more. And I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible.\u201d \n \n This rejoinder transforms the Ginsburg-Trump feud from a one-sided roast to a full-on debate. That is quite alarming, because in the United States, politicians and judges are not supposed to debate. Will Ginsburg respond? If she does, her actions will severely tarnish her legacy; if she doesn\u2019t, she may look craven. Best-case scenario, this feud gives Trump license to drag Ginsburg through the mud and turn her into an election issue; worst-case, it delegitimizes Ginsburg\u2019s judicial authority. And since Ginsburg\u2019s criticisms will change exactly zero minds, the benefits of the debate will flow almost exclusively to Trump. \n \n Ginsburg\u2019s comments also set a dark precedent for other justices with equally strong political inclinations\u2014in other words, every justice ever to sit on the bench except David Souter. I can\u2019t imagine, for instance, that Notorious RBG\u2013loving liberals would be as pleased to hear Justice Samuel Alito bash Hillary Clinton as they are to hear Ginsburg diss Trump. Had Ginsburg said something similar about Mitt Romney, or John McCain, or George W. Bush, her slights would have been profoundly inappropriate. Here, progressives might point out that Sandra Day O\u2019Connor declared her distaste for Al Gore on election night in 2000. (When Gore appeared to have won Florida, she reportedly said aloud, \u201cThis is terrible.\u201d) But her comment that night was neither as deliberate nor as brazen as Ginsburg\u2019s; it was more of a slip than an intentional campaign to impugn her disfavored candidate\u2019s character. \n \n Given all of these compelling reasons that Ginsburg should have refrained from speaking her mind about Trump, why did she take the risk? It seems clear that Ginsburg has made a very conscious decision to cash in her political capital after years of holding her fire. The justice is 83, and while she remains healthy and sharp, she probably won\u2019t sit on the court for much longer. She won\u2019t be impeached\u2014Supreme Court justices must do much worse to suffer that sorry fate\u2014and she can\u2019t be voted out. In effect, Ginsburg has nothing to lose but her good name. And that, it seems, is what she has decided she is willing to risk if it might potentially rally her admirers against Trump\u2019s looming peril. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Romney and McCain had qualities and policies that Ginsburg surely loathed as well. But they always had America\u2019s best interests at heart. That is altogether untrue of the sinister and self-interested Trump. For Ginsburg to treat Trump with the same respect\u2014that is, complete silence\u2014that she afforded previous Republican nominees would acquiesce to the premise that his candidacy is just like theirs. It would suggest that this is an election like any other, a run-of-the-mill election rather than a battle for America\u2019s soul. It would legitimize a fascist. ||||| NOTHING SUPREME Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has said in recent interviews about the presidential election should surprise anyone familiar with her biography and her career on the court. A lifelong left-of-center lawyer and feminist innovator who was appointed to the high court by President Bill Clinton in 1993, the 83-year-old Justice Ginsburg fits the profile of a Hillary Clinton supporter to a T. Obviously, she would rather have a Democrat appointing her next new colleague, and possibly her replacement. \n \n Nor were any of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s disparaging comments about the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump, untrue, at least not as we read the evidence. When Justice Ginsburg, elaborating on her previous anti-Trump remarks to the New York Times, told CNN this week that Mr. Trump \u201chas no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego,\u201d she certainly got no argument from us on the merits. (A brief dissent from the justice on one point, though: She rightly protested that Mr. Trump has not released his tax returns but incorrectly chided \u201cthe press\u201d for being \u201cvery gentle with him on that.\u201d) \n \n However valid her comments may have been, though, and however in keeping with her known political bent, they were still much, much better left unsaid by a member of the Supreme Court. There\u2019s a good reason the Code of Conduct for United States Judges flatly states that a \u201cjudge should not . . . publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.\u201d Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts. No doubt this restriction requires judges, and justices, to muzzle themselves and, to a certain extent, to pretend they either do or do not think various things that they obviously do or do not believe. As the saying goes, however, \u201chypocrisy is the compliment vice pays to virtue.\u201d \n \n As journalists, we generally favor more openness and disclosure from public figures rather than less. Yet Justice Ginsburg\u2019s off-the-cuff remarks about the campaign fall into that limited category of candor that we can\u2019t admire, because it\u2019s inconsistent with her function in our democratic system. Only 16 years ago, a key issue regarding the outcome of the 2000 presidential election wound up at the Supreme Court, whose decision in favor of Republican nominee George W. Bush, backed by five conservative Republican appointees, was regarded as controversial by many and nakedly partisan by some. Think of how that situation would have played out if one or more of the justices had previously mused about leaving for New Zealand in the event of a victory for either Mr. Bush or his opponent, Democrat Al Gore. \n \n When the story of Justice Ginsburg\u2019s career is written, there will be many highlights \u2014 her pioneering work as a lawyer advocating women\u2019s rights; her many trenchant opinions on the high court in defense of American society\u2019s underdogs. Her performance this week, alas, confirms her fallibility. ||||| Proposed Changes \n \n Review the proposed changes to the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges and the Judicial Conduct and Disability Rules, or read the public comments and witness statements, and watch the public hearing. \n \n Introduction \n \n Canon 1: A Judge Should Uphold the Integrity and Independence of the Judiciary \n \n Canon 2: A Judge Should Avoid Impropriety and the Appearance of Impropriety in All Activities \n \n Canon 3: A Judge Should Perform the Duties of the Office Fairly, Impartially and Diligently \n \n Canon 4: A Judge May Engage in Extrajudicial Activities That are Consistent With the Obligations of Judicial Office \n \n Canon 5: A Judge Should Refrain From Political Activity \n \n Compliance with the Code of Conduct \n \n Applicable Date of Compliance \n \n Introduction \n \n The Code of Conduct for United States Judges was initially adopted by the Judicial Conference on April 5, 1973, and was known as the \"Code of Judicial Conduct for United States Judges.\" See: JCUS-APR 73, pp. 9-11. Since then, the Judicial Conference has made the following changes to the Code: \n \n March 1987: deleted the word \"Judicial\" from the name of the Code; \n \n September 1992: adopted substantial revisions to the Code; \n \n March 1996: revised part C of the Compliance section, immediately following the Code; \n \n September 1996: revised Canons 3C(3)(a) and 5C(4); \n \n September 1999: revised Canon 3C(1)(c); \n \n September 2000: clarified the Compliance section; \n \n March 2009: adopted substantial revisions to the Code. \n \n March 2014: revised part C of the Compliance section, which appears below, immediately following the Code. \n \n This Code applies to United States circuit judges, district judges, Court of International Trade judges, Court of Federal Claims judges, bankruptcy judges, and magistrate judges. Certain provisions of this Code apply to special masters and commissioners as indicated in the \u201cCompliance\u201d section. The Tax Court, Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, and Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces have adopted this Code. \n \n The Judicial Conference has authorized its Committee on Codes of Conduct to render advisory opinions about this Code only when requested by a judge to whom this Code applies. Requests for opinions and other questions concerning this Code and its applicability should be addressed to the Chair of the Committee on Codes of Conduct by email or as follows: \n \n Chair, Committee on Codes of Conduct \n \n c/o General Counsel \n \n Administrative Office of the United States Courts \n \n Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building \n \n One Columbus Circle, N.E. \n \n Washington, D.C. 20544 \n \n 202-502-1100 \n \n Procedural questions may be addressed to: \n \n Office of the General Counsel \n \n Administrative Office of the United States Courts \n \n Thurgood Marshall Federal Judiciary Building \n \n One Columbus Circle, N.E. \n \n Washington, D.C. 20544 \n \n 202-502-1100 \n \n Canon 1: A Judge Should Uphold the Integrity and Independence of the Judiciary \n \n An independent and honorable judiciary is indispensable to justice in our society. A judge should maintain and enforce high standards of conduct and should personally observe those standards, so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary may be preserved. The provisions of this Code should be construed and applied to further that objective. \n \n COMMENTARY \n \n Deference to the judgments and rulings of courts depends on public confidence in the integrity and independence of judges. The integrity and independence of judges depend in turn on their acting without fear or favor. Although judges should be independent, they must comply with the law and should comply with this Code. Adherence to this responsibility helps to maintain public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary. Conversely, violation of this Code diminishes public confidence in the judiciary and injures our system of government under law. \n \n The Canons are rules of reason. They should be applied consistently with constitutional requirements, statutes, other court rules and decisional law, and in the context of all relevant circumstances. The Code is to be construed so it does not impinge on the essential independence of judges in making judicial decisions. \n \n The Code is designed to provide guidance to judges and nominees for judicial office. It may also provide standards of conduct for application in proceedings under the Judicial Councils Reform and Judicial Conduct and Disability Act of 1980 (28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 332(d)(1), 351-364). Not every violation of the Code should lead to disciplinary action. Whether disciplinary action is appropriate, and the degree of discipline, should be determined through a reasonable application of the text and should depend on such factors as the seriousness of the improper activity, the intent of the judge, whether there is a pattern of improper activity, and the effect of the improper activity on others or on the judicial system. Many of the restrictions in the Code are necessarily cast in general terms, and judges may reasonably differ in their interpretation. Furthermore, the Code is not designed or intended as a basis for civil liability or criminal prosecution. Finally, the Code is not intended to be used for tactical advantage. \n \n Canon 2: A Judge Should Avoid Impropriety and the Appearance of Impropriety in all Activities \n \n (A) Respect for Law. A judge should respect and comply with the law and should act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary. \n \n (B) Outside Influence. A judge should not allow family, social, political, financial, or other relationships to influence judicial conduct or judgment. A judge should neither lend the prestige of the judicial office to advance the private interests of the judge or others nor convey or permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special position to influence the judge. A judge should not testify voluntarily as a character witness. \n \n (C) Nondiscriminatory Membership. A judge should not hold membership in any organization that practices invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, or national origin. \n \n COMMENTARY \n \n Canon 2A. An appearance of impropriety occurs when reasonable minds, with knowledge of all the relevant circumstances disclosed by a reasonable inquiry, would conclude that the judge\u2019s honesty, integrity, impartiality, temperament, or fitness to serve as a judge is impaired. Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by irresponsible or improper conduct by judges. A judge must avoid all impropriety and appearance of impropriety. This prohibition applies to both professional and personal conduct. A judge must expect to be the subject of constant public scrutiny and accept freely and willingly restrictions that might be viewed as burdensome by the ordinary citizen. Because it is not practicable to list all prohibited acts, the prohibition is necessarily cast in general terms that extend to conduct by judges that is harmful although not specifically mentioned in the Code. Actual improprieties under this standard include violations of law, court rules, or other specific provisions of this Code. \n \n Canon 2B. Testimony as a character witness injects the prestige of the judicial office into the proceeding in which the judge testifies and may be perceived as an official testimonial. A judge should discourage a party from requiring the judge to testify as a character witness except in unusual circumstances when the demands of justice require. This Canon does not create a privilege against testifying in response to an official summons. \n \n A judge should avoid lending the prestige of judicial office to advance the private interests of the judge or others. For example, a judge should not use the judge\u2019s judicial position or title to gain advantage in litigation involving a friend or a member of the judge\u2019s family. In contracts for publication of a judge\u2019s writings, a judge should retain control over the advertising to avoid exploitation of the judge\u2019s office. \n \n A judge should be sensitive to possible abuse of the prestige of office. A judge should not initiate communications to a sentencing judge or a probation or corrections officer but may provide information to such persons in response to a formal request. Judges may participate in the process of judicial selection by cooperating with appointing authorities and screening committees seeking names for consideration and by responding to official inquiries concerning a person being considered for a judgeship. \n \n Canon 2C. Membership of a judge in an organization that practices invidious discrimination gives rise to perceptions that the judge\u2019s impartiality is impaired. Canon 2C refers to the current practices of the organization. Whether an organization practices invidious discrimination is often a complex question to which judges should be sensitive. The answer cannot be determined from a mere examination of an organization\u2019s current membership rolls but rather depends on how the organization selects members and other relevant factors, such as that the organization is dedicated to the preservation of religious, ethnic or cultural values of legitimate common interest to its members, or that it is in fact and effect an intimate, purely private organization whose membership limitations could not be constitutionally prohibited. See New York State Club Ass\u2019n. Inc. v. City of New York, 487 U.S. 1, 108 S. Ct. 2225, 101 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1988); Board of Directors of Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte, 481 U.S. 537, 107 S. Ct. 1940, 95 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1987); Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 104 S. Ct. 3244, 82 L. Ed. 2d 462 (1984). Other relevant factors include the size and nature of the organization and the diversity of persons in the locale who might reasonably be considered potential members. Thus the mere absence of diverse membership does not by itself demonstrate a violation unless reasonable persons with knowledge of all the relevant circumstances would expect that the membership would be diverse in the absence of invidious discrimination. Absent such factors, an organization is generally said to discriminate invidiously if it arbitrarily excludes from membership on the basis of race, religion, sex, or national origin persons who would otherwise be admitted to membership. \n \n Although Canon 2C relates only to membership in organizations that invidiously discriminate on the basis of race, sex, religion or national origin, a judge\u2019s membership in an organization that engages in any invidiously discriminatory membership practices prohibited by applicable law violates Canons 2 and 2A and gives the appearance of impropriety. In addition, it would be a violation of Canons 2 and 2A for a judge to arrange a meeting at a club that the judge knows practices invidious discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, or national origin in its membership or other policies, or for the judge to use such a club regularly. Moreover, public manifestation by a judge of the judge\u2019s knowing approval of invidious discrimination on any basis gives the appearance of impropriety under Canon 2 and diminishes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary, in violation of Canon 2A. \n \n When a judge determines that an organization to which the judge belongs engages in invidious discrimination that would preclude membership under Canon 2C or under Canons 2 and 2A, the judge is permitted, in lieu of resigning, to make immediate and continuous efforts to have the organization discontinue its invidiously discriminatory practices. If the organization fails to discontinue its invidiously discriminatory practices as promptly as possible (and in all events within two years of the judge\u2019s first learning of the practices), the judge should resign immediately from the organization. \n \n Canon 3: A Judge Should Perform the Duties of the Office Fairly, Impartially and Diligently \n \n The duties of judicial office take precedence over all other activities. In performing the duties prescribed by law, the judge should adhere to the following standards: \n \n (A) Adjudicative Responsibilities. \n \n (1) A judge should be faithful to, and maintain professional competence in, the law and should not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor, or fear of criticism. \n \n (2) A judge should hear and decide matters assigned, unless disqualified, and should maintain order and decorum in all judicial proceedings. \n \n (3) A judge should be patient, dignified, respectful, and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, lawyers, and others with whom the judge deals in an official capacity. A judge should require similar conduct of those subject to the judge\u2019s control, including lawyers to the extent consistent with their role in the adversary process. \n \n (4) A judge should accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding, and that person\u2019s lawyer, the full right to be heard according to law. Except as set out below, a judge should not initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications or consider other communications concerning a pending or impending matter that are made outside the presence of the parties or their lawyers. If a judge receives an unauthorized ex parte communication bearing on the substance of a matter, the judge should promptly notify the parties of the subject matter of the communication and allow the parties an opportunity to respond, if requested. A judge may: \n \n (a) initiate, permit, or consider ex parte communications as authorized by law; \n \n (b) when circumstances require it, permit ex parte communication for scheduling, administrative, or emergency purposes, but only if the ex parte communication does not address substantive matters and the judge reasonably believes that no party will gain a procedural, substantive, or tactical advantage as a result of the ex parte communication; \n \n (c) obtain the written advice of a disinterested expert on the law, but only after giving advance notice to the parties of the person to be consulted and the subject matter of the advice and affording the parties reasonable opportunity to object and respond to the notice and to the advice received; or \n \n (d) with the consent of the parties, confer separately with the parties and their counsel in an effort to mediate or settle pending matters. \n \n (5) A judge should dispose promptly of the business of the court. \n \n (6) A judge should not make public comment on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court. A judge should require similar restraint by court personnel subject to the judge\u2019s direction and control. The prohibition on public comment on the merits does not extend to public statements made in the course of the judge\u2019s official duties, to explanations of court procedures, or to scholarly presentations made for purposes of legal education. \n \n (B) Administrative Responsibilities. \n \n (1) A judge should diligently discharge administrative responsibilities, maintain professional competence in judicial administration, and facilitate the performance of the administrative responsibilities of other judges and court personnel. \n \n (2) A judge should not direct court personnel to engage in conduct on the judge\u2019s behalf or as the judge\u2019s representative when that conduct would contravene the Code if undertaken by the judge. \n \n (3) A judge should exercise the power of appointment fairly and only on the basis of merit, avoiding unnecessary appointments, nepotism, and favoritism. A judge should not approve compensation of appointees beyond the fair value of services rendered. \n \n (4) A judge with supervisory authority over other judges should take reasonable measures to ensure that they perform their duties timely and effectively. \n \n (5) A judge should take appropriate action upon learning of reliable evidence indicating the likelihood that a judge\u2019s conduct contravened this Code or a lawyer violated applicable rules of professional conduct. \n \n (C) Disqualification. \n \n (1) A judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances in which: \n \n (a) the judge has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party, or personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding; \n \n (b) the judge served as a lawyer in the matter in controversy, or a lawyer with whom the judge previously practiced law served during such association as a lawyer concerning the matter, or the judge or lawyer has been a material witness; \n \n (c) the judge knows that the judge, individually or as a fiduciary, or the judge\u2019s spouse or minor child residing in the judge\u2019s household, has a financial interest in the subject matter in controversy or in a party to the proceeding, or any other interest that could be affected substantially by the outcome of the proceeding; \n \n (d) the judge or the judge\u2019s spouse, or a person related to either within the third degree of relationship, or the spouse of such a person is: \n \n (i) a party to the proceeding, or an officer, director, or trustee of a party; \n \n (ii) acting as a lawyer in the proceeding; \n \n (iii) known by the judge to have an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding; or \n \n (iv) to the judge\u2019s knowledge likely to be a material witness in the proceeding; \n \n (e) the judge has served in governmental employment and in that capacity participated as a judge (in a previous judicial position), counsel, advisor, or material witness concerning the proceeding or has expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy. \n \n (2) A judge should keep informed about the judge\u2019s personal and fiduciary financial interests and make a reasonable effort to keep informed about the personal financial interests of the judge\u2019s spouse and minor children residing in the judge\u2019s household. \n \n (3) For the purposes of this section: \n \n (a) the degree of relationship is calculated according to the civil law system; the following relatives are within the third degree of relationship: parent, child, grandparent, grandchild, great grandparent, great grandchild, sister, brother, aunt, uncle, niece, and nephew; the listed relatives include whole and half blood relatives and most step relatives; \n \n (b) \u201cfiduciary\u201d includes such relationships as executor, administrator, trustee, and guardian; \n \n (c) \u201cfinancial interest\u201d means ownership of a legal or equitable interest, however small, or a relationship as director, advisor, or other active participant in the affairs of a party, except that: \n \n (i) ownership in a mutual or common investment fund that holds securities is not a \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in such securities unless the judge participates in the management of the fund; \n \n (ii) an office in an educational, religious, charitable, fraternal, or civic organization is not a \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in securities held by the organization; \n \n (iii) the proprietary interest of a policyholder in a mutual insurance company, or a depositor in a mutual savings association, or a similar proprietary interest, is a \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in the organization only if the outcome of the proceeding could substantially affect the value of the interest; \n \n (iv) ownership of government securities is a \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in the issuer only if the outcome of the proceeding could substantially affect the value of the securities; \n \n (d) \u201cproceeding\u201d includes pretrial, trial, appellate review, or other stages of litigation. \n \n (4) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Canon, if a judge would be disqualified because of a financial interest in a party (other than an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome), disqualification is not required if the judge (or the judge\u2019s spouse or minor child) divests the interest that provides the grounds for disqualification. \n \n (D) Remittal of Disqualification. Instead of withdrawing from the proceeding, a judge disqualified by Canon 3C(1) may, except in the circumstances specifically set out in subsections (a) through (e), disclose on the record the basis of disqualification. The judge may participate in the proceeding if, after that disclosure, the parties and their lawyers have an opportunity to confer outside the presence of the judge, all agree in writing or on the record that the judge should not be disqualified, and the judge is then willing to participate. The agreement should be incorporated in the record of the proceeding. \n \n COMMENTARY \n \n Canon 3A(3). The duty to hear all proceedings fairly and with patience is not inconsistent with the duty to dispose promptly of the business of the court. Courts can be efficient and businesslike while being patient and deliberate. \n \n The duty under Canon 2 to act in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary applies to all the judge\u2019s activities, including the discharge of the judge\u2019s adjudicative and administrative responsibilities. The duty to be respectful includes the responsibility to avoid comment or behavior that could reasonably be interpreted as harassment, prejudice or bias. \n \n Canon 3A(4). The restriction on ex parte communications concerning a proceeding includes communications from lawyers, law teachers, and others who are not participants in the proceeding. A judge may consult with other judges or with court personnel whose function is to aid the judge in carrying out adjudicative responsibilities. A judge should make reasonable efforts to ensure that law clerks and other court personnel comply with this provision. \n \n A judge may encourage and seek to facilitate settlement but should not act in a manner that coerces any party into surrendering the right to have the controversy resolved by the courts. \n \n Canon 3A(5). In disposing of matters promptly, efficiently, and fairly, a judge must demonstrate due regard for the rights of the parties to be heard and to have issues resolved without unnecessary cost or delay. A judge should monitor and supervise cases to reduce or eliminate dilatory practices, avoidable delays, and unnecessary costs. \n \n Prompt disposition of the court\u2019s business requires a judge to devote adequate time to judicial duties, to be punctual in attending court and expeditious in determining matters under submission, and to take reasonable measures to ensure that court personnel, litigants, and their lawyers cooperate with the judge to that end. \n \n Canon 3A(6). The admonition against public comment about the merits of a pending or impending matter continues until the appellate process is complete. If the public comment involves a case from the judge\u2019s own court, the judge should take particular care so that the comment does not denigrate public confidence in the judiciary\u2019s integrity and impartiality, which would violate Canon 2A. A judge may comment publicly on proceedings in which the judge is a litigant in a personal capacity, but not on mandamus proceedings when the judge is a litigant in an official capacity (but the judge may respond in accordance with Fed. R. App. P. 21(b)). \n \n Canon 3B(3). A judge\u2019s appointees include assigned counsel, officials such as referees, commissioners, special masters, receivers, guardians, and personnel such as law clerks, secretaries, and judicial assistants. Consent by the parties to an appointment or an award of compensation does not relieve the judge of the obligation prescribed by this subsection. \n \n Canon 3B(5). Appropriate action may include direct communication with the judge or lawyer, other direct action if available, reporting the conduct to the appropriate authorities, or, when the judge believes that a judge\u2019s or lawyer\u2019s conduct is caused by drugs, alcohol, or a medical condition, making a confidential referral to an assistance program. Appropriate action may also include responding to a subpoena to testify or otherwise participating in judicial or lawyer disciplinary proceedings; a judge should be candid and honest with disciplinary authorities. \n \n Canon 3C. Recusal considerations applicable to a judge\u2019s spouse should also be considered with respect to a person other than a spouse with whom the judge maintains both a household and an intimate relationship. \n \n Canon 3C(1)(c). In a criminal proceeding, a victim entitled to restitution is not, within the meaning of this Canon, a party to the proceeding or the subject matter in controversy. A judge who has a financial interest in the victim of a crime is not required by Canon 3C(1)(c) to disqualify from the criminal proceeding, but the judge must do so if the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned under Canon 3C(1) or if the judge has an interest that could be substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding under Canon 3C(1)(d)(iii). \n \n Canon 3C(1)(d)(ii). The fact that a lawyer in a proceeding is affiliated with a law firm with which a relative of the judge is affiliated does not of itself disqualify the judge. However, if \u201cthe judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned\u201d under Canon 3C(1), or the relative is known by the judge to have an interest in the law firm that could be \u201csubstantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding\u201d under Canon 3C(1)(d)(iii), the judge\u2019s disqualification is required. \n \n Canon 4: A Judge May Engage in Extrajudicial Activities that are Consistent with the Obligations of Judicial Office \n \n A judge may engage in extrajudicial activities, including law-related pursuits and civic, charitable, educational, religious, social, financial, fiduciary, and governmental activities, and may speak, write, lecture, and teach on both law-related and nonlegal subjects. However, a judge should not participate in extrajudicial activities that detract from the dignity of the judge\u2019s office, interfere with the performance of the judge\u2019s official duties, reflect adversely on the judge\u2019s impartiality, lead to frequent disqualification, or violate the limitations set forth below. \n \n (A) Law-related Activities. \n \n (1) Speaking, Writing, and Teaching. A judge may speak, write, lecture, teach, and participate in other activities concerning the law, the legal system, and the administration of justice \n \n (2) Consultation. A judge may consult with or appear at a public hearing before an executive or legislative body or official: \n \n (a)on matters concerning the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice; \n \n (b)to the extent that it would generally be perceived that a judge\u2019s judicial experience provides special expertise in the area; or \n \n (c)when the judge is acting pro se in a matter involving the judge or the judge\u2019s interest. \n \n (3) Organizations. A judge may participate in and serve as a member, officer, director, trustee, or nonlegal advisor of a nonprofit organization devoted to the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice and may assist such an organization in the management and investment of funds. A judge may make recommendations to public and private fund-granting agencies about projects and programs concerning the law, the legal system, and the administration of justice. \n \n (4) Arbitration and Mediation. A judge should not act as an arbitrator or mediator or otherwise perform judicial functions apart from the judge\u2019s official duties unless expressly authorized by law. \n \n (5) Practice of Law. A judge should not practice law and should not serve as a family member\u2019s lawyer in any forum. A judge may, however, act pro se and may, without compensation, give legal advice to and draft or review documents for a member of the judge\u2019s family. \n \n (B) Civic and Charitable Activities. A judge may participate in and serve as an officer, director, trustee, or nonlegal advisor of a nonprofit civic, charitable, educational, religious, or social organization, subject to the following limitations: \n \n (1) A judge should not serve if it is likely that the organization will either be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the judge or be regularly engaged in adversary proceedings in any court. \n \n (2) A judge should not give investment advice to such an organization but may serve on its board of directors or trustees even though it has the responsibility for approving investment decisions. \n \n (C) Fund Raising. A judge may assist nonprofit law-related, civic, charitable, educational, religious, or social organizations in planning fund-raising activities and may be listed as an officer, director, or trustee. A judge may solicit funds for such an organization from judges over whom the judge does not exercise supervisory or appellate authority and from members of the judge\u2019s family. Otherwise, a judge should not personally participate in fund-raising activities, solicit funds for any organization, or use or permit the use of the prestige of judicial office for that purpose. A judge should not personally participate in membership solicitation if the solicitation might reasonably be perceived as coercive or is essentially a fund-raising mechanism. \n \n (D) Financial Activities. \n \n (1) A judge may hold and manage investments, including real estate, and engage in other remunerative activity, but should refrain from financial and business dealings that exploit the judicial position or involve the judge in frequent transactions or continuing business relationships with lawyers or other persons likely to come before the court on which the judge serves. \n \n (2) A judge may serve as an officer, director, active partner, manager, advisor, or employee of a business only if the business is closely held and controlled by members of the judge\u2019s family. For this purpose, \u201cmembers of the judge\u2019s family\u201d means persons related to the judge or the judge\u2019s spouse within the third degree of relationship as defined in Canon 3C(3)(a), any other relative with whom the judge or the judge\u2019s spouse maintains a close familial relationship, and the spouse of any of the foregoing. \n \n (3) As soon as the judge can do so without serious financial detriment, the judge should divest investments and other financial interests that might require frequent disqualification. \n \n (4) A judge should comply with the restrictions on acceptance of gifts and the prohibition on solicitation of gifts set forth in the Judicial Conference Gift Regulations. A judge should endeavor to prevent any member of the judge\u2019s family residing in the household from soliciting or accepting a gift except to the extent that a judge would be permitted to do so by the Judicial Conference Gift Regulations. A \u201cmember of the judge\u2019s family\u201d means any relative of a judge by blood, adoption, or marriage, or any person treated by a judge as a member of the judge\u2019s family. \n \n (5) A judge should not disclose or use nonpublic information acquired in a judicial capacity for any purpose unrelated to the judge\u2019s official duties. \n \n (E) Fiduciary Activities. A judge may serve as the executor, administrator, trustee, guardian, or other fiduciary only for the estate, trust, or person of a member of the judge\u2019s family as defined in Canon 4D(4). As a family fiduciary a judge is subject to the following restrictions: \n \n (1) The judge should not serve if it is likely that as a fiduciary the judge would be engaged in proceedings that would ordinarily come before the judge or if the estate, trust, or ward becomes involved in adversary proceedings in the court on which the judge serves or one under its appellate jurisdiction. \n \n (2) While acting as a fiduciary, a judge is subject to the same restrictions on financial activities that apply to the judge in a personal capacity. \n \n (F) Governmental Appointments. A judge may accept appointment to a governmental committee, commission, or other position only if it is one that concerns the law, the legal system, or the administration of justice, or if appointment of a judge is required by federal statute. A judge should not, in any event, accept such an appointment if the judge\u2019s governmental duties would tend to undermine the public confidence in the integrity, impartiality, or independence of the judiciary. A judge may represent the judge\u2019s country, state, or locality on ceremonial occasions or in connection with historical, educational, and cultural activities. \n \n (G) Chambers, Resources, and Staff. A judge should not to any substantial degree use judicial chambers, resources, or staff to engage in extrajudicial activities permitted by this Canon. \n \n (H) Compensation, Reimbursement, and Financial Reporting. A judge may accept compensation and reimbursement of expenses for the law-related and extrajudicial activities permitted by this Code if the source of the payments does not give the appearance of influencing the judge in the judge\u2019s judicial duties or otherwise give the appearance of impropriety, subject to the following restrictions: \n \n (1) Compensation should not exceed a reasonable amount nor should it exceed what a person who is not a judge would receive for the same activity. \n \n (2) Expense reimbursement should be limited to the actual costs of travel, food, and lodging reasonably incurred by the judge and, where appropriate to the occasion, by the judge\u2019s spouse or relative. Any additional payment is compensation. \n \n (3) A judge should make required financial disclosures, including disclosures of gifts and other things of value, in compliance with applicable statutes and Judicial Conference regulations and directives. \n \n COMMENTARY \n \n Canon 4. Complete separation of a judge from extrajudicial activities is neither possible nor wise; a judge should not become isolated from the society in which the judge lives. As a judicial officer and a person specially learned in the law, a judge is in a unique position to contribute to the law, the legal system, and the administration of justice, including revising substantive and procedural law and improving criminal and juvenile justice. To the extent that the judge\u2019s time permits and impartiality is not compromised, the judge is encouraged to do so, either independently or through a bar association, judicial conference, or other organization dedicated to the law. Subject to the same limitations, judges may also engage in a wide range of non-law-related activities. \n \n Within the boundaries of applicable law (see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 953) a judge may express opposition to the persecution of lawyers and judges anywhere in the world if the judge has ascertained, after reasonable inquiry, that the persecution is occasioned by conflict between the professional responsibilities of the persecuted judge or lawyer and the policies or practices of the relevant government. \n \n A person other than a spouse with whom the judge maintains both a household and an intimate relationship should be considered a member of the judge\u2019s family for purposes of legal assistance under Canon 4A(5), fund raising under Canon 4C, and family business activities under Canon 4D(2). \n \n Canon 4A. Teaching and serving on the board of a law school are permissible, but in the case of a for-profit law school, board service is limited to a nongoverning advisory board. \n \n Consistent with this Canon, a judge may encourage lawyers to provide pro bono legal services. \n \n Canon 4A(4). This Canon generally prohibits a judge from mediating a state court matter, except in unusual circumstances (e.g., when a judge is mediating a federal matter that cannot be resolved effectively without addressing the related state court matter). \n \n Canon 4A(5). A judge may act pro se in all legal matters, including matters involving litigation and matters involving appearances before or other dealings with governmental bodies. In so doing, a judge must not abuse the prestige of office to advance the interests of the judge or the judge\u2019s family. \n \n Canon 4B. The changing nature of some organizations and their exposure to litigation make it necessary for a judge regularly to reexamine the activities of each organization with which the judge is affiliated to determine if the judge\u2019s continued association is appropriate. For example, in many jurisdictions, charitable hospitals are in court more often now than in the past. \n \n Canon 4C. A judge may attend fund-raising events of law-related and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or featured on the program of such an event. Use of a judge\u2019s name, position in the organization, and judicial designation on an organization\u2019s letterhead, including when used for fund raising or soliciting members, does not violate Canon 4C if comparable information and designations are listed for others. \n \n Canon 4D(1), (2), and (3). Canon 3 requires disqualification of a judge in any proceeding in which the judge has a financial interest, however small. Canon 4D requires a judge to refrain from engaging in business and from financial activities that might interfere with the impartial performance of the judge\u2019s judicial duties. Canon 4H requires a judge to report compensation received for activities outside the judicial office. A judge has the rights of an ordinary citizen with respect to financial affairs, except for limitations required to safeguard the proper performance of the judge\u2019s duties. A judge\u2019s participation in a closely held family business, while generally permissible, may be prohibited if it takes too much time or involves misuse of judicial prestige or if the business is likely to come before the court on which the judge serves. Owning and receiving income from investments do not as such affect the performance of a judge\u2019s duties. \n \n Canon 4D(5). The restriction on using nonpublic information is not intended to affect a judge\u2019s ability to act on information as necessary to protect the health or safety of the judge or a member of a judge\u2019s family, court personnel, or other judicial officers if consistent with other provisions of this Code. \n \n Canon 4E. Mere residence in the judge\u2019s household does not by itself make a person a member of the judge\u2019s family for purposes of this Canon. The person must be treated by the judge as a member of the judge\u2019s family. \n \n The Applicable Date of Compliance provision of this Code addresses continued service as a fiduciary. \n \n A judge\u2019s obligation under this Code and the judge\u2019s obligation as a fiduciary may come into conflict. For example, a judge should resign as a trustee if it would result in detriment to the trust to divest holdings whose retention would require frequent disqualification of the judge in violation of Canon 4D(3). \n \n Canon 4F. The appropriateness of accepting extrajudicial assignments must be assessed in light of the demands on judicial resources and the need to protect the courts from involvement in matters that may prove to be controversial. Judges should not accept governmental appointments that could interfere with the effectiveness and independence of the judiciary, interfere with the performance of the judge\u2019s judicial responsibilities, or tend to undermine public confidence in the judiciary. \n \n Canon 4H. A judge is not required by this Code to disclose income, debts, or investments, except as provided in this Canon. The Ethics Reform Act of 1989 and implementing regulations promulgated by the Judicial Conference impose additional restrictions on judges\u2019 receipt of compensation. That Act and those regulations should be consulted before a judge enters into any arrangement involving the receipt of compensation. The restrictions so imposed include but are not limited to: (1) a prohibition against receiving \u201chonoraria\u201d (defined as anything of value received for a speech, appearance, or article), (2) a prohibition against receiving compensation for service as a director, trustee, or officer of a profit or nonprofit organization, (3) a requirement that compensated teaching activities receive prior approval, and (4) a limitation on the receipt of \u201coutside earned income.\u201d \n \n Canon 5: A Judge Should Refrain from Political Activity \n \n (A) General Prohibitions. A judge should not: \n \n (1) act as a leader or hold any office in a political organization; \n \n (2) make speeches for a political organization or candidate, or publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office; or \n \n (3) solicit funds for, pay an assessment to, or make a contribution to a political organization or candidate, or attend or purchase a ticket for a dinner or other event sponsored by a political organization or candidate. \n \n (B) Resignation upon Candidacy. A judge should resign the judicial office if the judge becomes a candidate in a primary or general election for any office. \n \n (C) Other Political Activity. A judge should not engage in any other political activity. This provision does not prevent a judge from engaging in activities described in Canon 4. \n \n COMMENTARY \n \n The term \u201cpolitical organization\u201d refers to a political party, a group affiliated with a political party or candidate for public office, or an entity whose principal purpose is to advocate for or against political candidates or parties in connection with elections for public office. \n \n Compliance with the Code of Conduct \n \n Anyone who is an officer of the federal judicial system authorized to perform judicial functions is a judge for the purpose of this Code. All judges should comply with this Code except as provided below. \n \n (A) Part-time Judge \n \n A part-time judge is a judge who serves part-time, whether continuously or periodically, but is permitted by law to devote time to some other profession or occupation and whose compensation for that reason is less than that of a full-time judge. A part-time judge: \n \n (1) is not required to comply with Canons 4A(4), 4A(5), 4D(2), 4E, 4F, or 4H(3); \n \n (2) except as provided in the Conflict-of-Interest Rules for Part-time Magistrate Judges, should not practice law in the court on which the judge serves or in any court subject to that court's appellate jurisdiction, or act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which the judge has served as a judge or in any related proceeding. \n \n (B) Judge Pro Tempore \n \n A judge pro tempore is a person who is appointed to act temporarily as a judge or as a special master. \n \n (1) While acting in this capacity, a judge pro tempore is not required to comply with Canons 4A(4), 4A(5), 4D(2), 4D(3), 4E, 4F, or 4H(3); further, one who acts solely as a special master is not required to comply with Canons 4A(3), 4B, 4C, 4D(4), or 5. \n \n (2) A person who has been a judge pro tempore should not act as a lawyer in a proceeding in which the judge has served as a judge or in any related proceeding. \n \n (C) Retired Judge \n \n A judge who is retired under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 371(b) or \u00a7 372(a) (applicable to Article III judges), or who is subject to recall under \u00a7 178(d) (applicable to judges on the Court of Federal Claims), or who is recalled to judicial service, should comply with all the provisions of this Code except Canon 4F, but the judge should refrain from judicial service during the period of extrajudicial appointment not sanctioned by Canon 4F. All other retired judges who are eligible for recall to judicial service (except those in U.S. territories and possessions) should comply with the provisions of this Code governing part-time judges. However, bankruptcy judges and magistrate judges who are eligible for recall but who have notified the Administrative Office of the United States Courts that they will not consent to recall are not obligated to comply with the provisions of this Code governing part-time judges. Such notification may be made at any time after retirement, and is irrevocable. A senior judge in the territories and possessions must comply with this Code as prescribed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 373(c)(5) and (d). \n \n COMMENTARY \n \n The 2014 amendment to the Compliance section, regarding retired bankruptcy judges and magistrate judges and exempting those judges from compliance with the Code as part-time judges if they notify the Administrative Office of the United States Courts that they will not consent to recall, was not intended to alter those judges\u2019 statutory entitlements to annuities, cost-of-living adjustments, or any other retirement benefits. \n \n Applicable Date of Compliance \n \n Persons to whom this Code applies should arrange their financial and fiduciary affairs as soon as reasonably possible to comply with it and should do so in any event within one year after appointment. If, however, the demands on the person's time and the possibility of conflicts of interest are not substantial, such a person may continue to act, without compensation, as an executor, administrator, trustee, or other fiduciary for the estate or person of one who is not a member of the person's family if terminating the relationship would unnecessarily jeopardize any substantial interest of the estate or person and if the judicial council of the circuit approves. \n \n Last revised (Transmittal 02-016) March 20, 2014 ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Ruth Bader Ginsburg would probably need something harder than a bottle of fine California wine to get her to vote for Donald Trump in November\u2014in fact, she doesn't even want to think about him as president, as she told the AP in an interview last week before piling on the Trump disparagement even further with the New York Times and CNN. The jury is now in on her remarks, and she may want to appeal. Some thoughts from around the internet: Mark Joseph Stern writes for Slate that Ginsburg's comments have been called \"explosive, unprecedented, and unethical,\" by both liberals and conservatives, and he agrees that what she did was \"dangerous\" as well as a breach of ethics. But he says that's exactly Ginsburg's point, and it may be a strategic one in which she's willing to give up her \"good name\" and \"sacrifice some of her prestige \u2026 to send as clear a warning signal about Trump as she possibly can.\" Ginsburg \"abandoned judicial propriety to wrestle in the mud with a candidate she detests,\" he writes. \"It is not pretty, it is not pleasant, and it may not even be that smart. But it may be the one thing the justice can do to help prevent a President Trump.\" His entire take here. The New York Times editorial board notes that Ginsburg has done nothing illegal\u2014but it's sort of siding with Trump on this one. The paper points out that Antonin Scalia's recent death in an election year makes a new president's possible influence in picking a new justice especially critical. It calls it \"baffling\" that Ginsburg would stoop to his level and \"call her own commitment to impartiality into question,\" adding that DC already has enough partisan issues \"without the spectacle of a Supreme Court justice flinging herself into the mosh pit.\" The Washington Post adds that not only were Ginsburg's remarks not illegal, they weren't surprising, given her feminist history, nor were they necessarily untrue. But it agrees with the Times that her \"off-the-cuff\" statements were \"inappropriate\" and probably best never spoken. \"Politicization, real or perceived, undermines public faith in the impartiality of the courts,\" the editorial board writes, citing the Code of Conduct for United States Judges' section on refraining from political activity. \"[Her comments] fall into that limited category of candor that we can't admire, because it's inconsistent with her function in our democratic system.\" Donald Trump himself addressed Ginsburg's shade with the New York Times on Tuesday, but he added more thoughts on Twitter early Wednesday, tweeting, \"Justice Ginsburg of the US Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me. Her mind is shot\u2014resign!\"",

That figure means that Lexi's home placement is dictated by the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978. \n \n Rusty Page carries Lexi while Summer Page, in the background, cries as members of family services, left, arrive to take Lexi away from her foster family in Santa Clarita, Calif., on March 21. David Crane / Los Angeles Daily News via AP \n \n That law \"seeks to keep American Indian children with American Indian families,\" according to its own language. \n \n The child's birth parents struggled with substance abuse, according to court documents. Her father, who had a criminal history, never lived on a Choctaw reservation and didn't have any social, political, or cultural ties to the tribe, according to the court documents. But officials determined that Lexi is 1/64th Choctaw based on his ancestry. \n \n Lexi was placed with the Pages \u2014 who have three other children \u2014 in December 2011 after two unsuccessful foster homes, including one where she was taken out of because of a black eye and a scrape on her face, the court documents said. \n \n In 2011, \"extended\" family in Utah became aware that Lexi was with a foster family and expressed \"interest in adopting\" her, according to the documents. The documents said that Lexi is related to the Utah couple, who are not Native American, through her step-grandfather. \n \n The California Court of Appeals originally ruled in August of 2014 that Lexi could stay with the Pages and they could continue to fight the Utah family for custody of the child. \n \n But a decision earlier this month ordered the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (LA DCFS) to place Lexi with the Utah family \"in accordance with the federal Indian Child Welfare Act,\" the department said in response to inquiries about Lexi's case. \n \n In the days after losing their legal battle, the Pages addressed an online petition called \"Keep Lexi Home\" to several California and LA DCFS officials. \n \n \"There is a 6-year-old little girl who is going to be ripped away from the only family that she has ever known. Her name is Lexi,\" the petition said. \"To Lexi this family is her everything \u2014 her mommy, daddy and brother and sisters.\" By Monday afternoon, more than 40,000 people had signed the petition. \n \n Dozens of supporters also surrounded the Page's home Monday in an attempt to block LA DCFS officers. Many of those gathered had been camped out in the street \u2014 singing and praying \u2014 since Sunday, when the officers were originally expected to arrive. \n \n Their efforts weren't successful. \n \n Lexi was taken from the Page home on Monday afternoon, Armand Montiel, a public affairs director with LA DCFS, told NBC News. \n \n The emotional scene played out on a Facebook live stream \u2014 watched by more that 1,000 people \u2014 which showed a teary child, wearing a pink shirt and grasping a teddy bear while Rusty Page carried her out of the home and loaded into a black sedan as his wife wailed \"I love you Lexi\" from the driveway. \n \n They are taking her!

(Associated Press) \n \n Graham, center, and Lena Kelly, rear, Lexi's foster aunt and uncle, break down on the street after family services came to take Lexi away from her foster family in Santa Clarita, Calif., Monday, March 21, 2016. Lexi, who spent most of her life with California foster parents, was removed from her home... (Associated Press) \n \n LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A California family appealed Tuesday to the state's highest court in their fight to keep a 6-year-old foster child who was removed from their home after a lower court said her 1/64th Native American bloodline requires that she live with relatives. \n \n The family's lawyer, Lori Alvino McGill, filed the request for the California Supreme Court to hear the appeal. \n \n McGill also requested that custody of the child named Lexi be returned to Rusty and Summer Page until the appeal is decided. \n \n The Pages have fought efforts under the federal Indian Child Welfare Act to place Lexi with relatives of her father, who is part Choctaw. The Pages argued that Lexi has lived with them since the age of 2 and considers them her family. \n \n However, a court found that the Pages have not proven Lexi would suffer emotional harm by the transfer. \n \n The Pages have three children and want to adopt Lexi, who was 17 months old when she was removed from the custody of her birth parents. Her mother had substance abuse problems, and her father had a criminal history, according to court records. \n \n Dozens of cases involving foster families have gone to court around the country after the Indian Child Welfare Act was passed in the late 1970s. \n \n Lawmakers found that Native American families were broken up at disproportionately high rates, and that cultural ignorance and biases within the child welfare system were largely to blame. \n \n Lexi cried and clutched a stuffed bear on Monday as Rusty Page carried her out of his home near Los Angeles and Los Angeles County social workers whisked her away in a waiting car. \n \n \"How is it that a screaming child, saying, 'I want to stay, I'm scared,' how is it in her best interest to pull her from the girl she was before that doorbell rang?\" Rusty Page told KNX-AM radio. \n \n A crowd of friends and neighbors wept, prayed or sang hymns. \n \n Under the transfer, Lexi will live with a Utah couple who are not Native Americans but are related by marriage to her father. \n \n The girl's sister is living with the couple, and another sister will be living down the street, said Leslie Heimov of the Children's Law Center of California, Lexi's court-appointed legal representatives. \n \n \"The law is very clear that siblings should be kept together whenever they can be, and they should be placed together even if they were not initially together,\" Heimov told the Los Angeles Daily News (http://bit.ly/1pYtXlg ). \n \n She said Lexi and the Utah family had traded messages and had monthly visits during the past three years. \n \n \"She has a loving relationship with them,\" Heimov said. \"They are not strangers in any way, shape or form.\" \n \n The National Indian Child Welfare Association said in a statement that the Pages were aware for years that the girl was an American Indian but chose to \"drag out litigation as long as possible, creating instability for the child.\" \n \n The Choctaw Nation said it \"desires the best for this Choctaw child.\" \n \n In 2015, the Bureau of Indian Affairs issued guidance on implementing the Indian Child Welfare Act \u2014 clarifying that tribes alone are responsible for determining who is a member. \n \n Wenona Singel, a law professor at Michigan State University, said membership requirements vary among tribes, with some being more restrictive than others. \n \n \"The issue is not what degree of Choctaw ancestry a child has,\" Singel said. \"Rather the issue is whether the child is a citizen of the tribe in question or eligible for citizenship.\" \n \n Singel is a member of a tribe in Michigan. \n \n There is still considerable disagreement over the application of the law and whether it serves children's best interest, said Ralph Richard Banks, a professor at Stanford Law School. \n \n Once a child is placed with a Native American family, it is highly unlikely that the decision would be reversed, he added. \n \n \"It would be fairly extraordinary for an appeals court to reverse that,\" he said. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Christine Armario contributed to this report. ||||| Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 \n \n NEW! New ICWA Regs Resource Page \n \n NEW! Dispelling the Top 10 ICWA Myths \n \n NEW! NICWA's FAQs \n \n NEW! NICWA Bringing ICWA Training to a City Near You! \n \n \n \n The Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) is a federal law that seeks to keep American Indian children with American Indian/Alaska Native families. Congress passed ICWA in 1978 in response to the alarmingly high number of Indian children being removed from their homes by both public and private agencies. The intent of Congress under ICWA was to \"protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families\" (25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902). ICWA sets federal requirements that apply to state child custody proceedings involving an Indian child who is a member of or eligible for membership in a federally recognized tribe. \n \n ICWA is an integral policy framework on which tribal child welfare programs rely. It provides a structure and requirements for how public and private child welfare agencies and state courts view and conduct their work to serve tribal children and families. It also acknowledges and promotes the role that tribal governments play in supporting tribal families, both on and off tribal lands. However, as is the case with many laws, proper implementation of ICWA requires vigilance, resources, and advocacy. \n \n Resources for Families \n \n If you have questions regarding an ICWA case or other Indian child welfare issues, please review the following online resources and the Frequently Asked Questions before contacting the NICWA office.

Lexi is now with a Utah couple related by marriage to Lexi's biological dad, who has Choctaw blood but has never lived on a reservation himself.

The National Indian Child Welfare Association says in a statement that foster care is meant to be \"temporary,\" not to \"fast-track the creation of new families when there is extended family available\"; a Choctaw Nation statement says the Pages always knew the goal was to place Lexi with \"family.\" On Tuesday, the Pages appealed to California's highest court to reverse the decision, reports the AP.

A Spanish court has ruled that a doctor stole a newborn child nearly five decades ago, one of many abducted during Spain's 20th-century dictatorship, but cleared him because the statute of limitations had expired.... (Associated Press) \n \n MADRID (AP) \u2014 A Spanish court ruled Monday that a doctor stole a newborn child nearly five decades ago, one of the many abducted during Spain's 20th-century dictatorship, but cleared him because the statute of limitations had expired. \n \n The Madrid court said 85-year-old gynecologist Eduardo Vela could not be punished because one of those who were stolen, plaintiff Ines Madrigal, did not make her complaint until 2012, more than a decade after the gravest crime had taken place. \n \n The court did find, however, that Vela was responsible for abducting Madrigal in 1969, faking her birth by her adoptive parents and forging official documents. \n \n Monday's verdict is Spain's first in relation to the wide-scale child trafficking that took place from the onset of the country's Civil War in 1936 to the death of dictator Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975. \n \n The right-wing regime waged a campaign to take away the children of poor families, prisoners or political enemies, sometimes stripping women of their newborns by lying and saying they had died during labor. The children were then given to pro-Franco families or the church, who educated the children on the regime's ideology and on Roman Catholicism. \n \n Vela, the director of a Madrid clinic considered to be at the epicenter of the scandal, denied the accusations during this year's trial. \n \n Madrigal, who learned at 18 that she wasn't living with her biological parents, argued that she couldn't have lodged her complaint earlier because she only learned about the scheme in 2010, when her adopting mother, who died three years later, disclosed the details of what had happened at Vela's clinic. \n \n DNA tests confirmed the account, but Madrigal's biological parents were never found. \n \n Madrigal, now 49, said she considered the provincial court's verdict to be \"bittersweet\" and announced she would be appealing it to the country's Supreme Court. \n \n \"I'm happy because the judges are acknowledging that there was theft, that I was taken away from my mother, but I didn't think they would stop short of convicting him,\" she told reporters, adding that \"the judges should had been brave.\" \n \n Madrigal's was the only case of \"stolen babies\" \u2014 as they are known in Spain \u2014 that has made it to the trial stage. Most lawsuits have been rejected in the past by courts for coming after the statute of limitations expired. \n \n Spain only started investigating the \"stolen babies\" cases a decade ago, when National Court magistrate Baltasar Garzon opened a probe on the more than 30,000 children that were under the care of the regime. ||||| An elderly Spanish doctor who became the first person to stand trial over the country\u2019s infamous \u201cstolen babies\u201d scandal has been found guilty of all charges but acquitted because the statute of limitations had expired. \n \n Eduardo Vela, who worked as a gynaecologist at the San Ram\u00f3n clinic in Madrid, had been accused of taking In\u00e9s Madrigal from her biological mother in the spring of 1969 and giving her to the 46-year-old woman who was falsely certified as her birth mother and who would raise her. \n \n Prosecutors had sought an 11-year prison sentence for Vela on charges of unlawful detention, falsifying official documents and certifying a nonexistent birth. \n \n Judges at Madrid\u2019s provincial court on Monday said that Vela\u2019s landmark trial, which began at the end of June, had \u201cindisputably proved\u201d that he had committed the three offences and it was \u201ccrystal clear\u201d the doctor, now 85, had faked official documents and handed the baby over to a couple who were not her parents. \n \n Franco's cruel legacy: the film that wants to stop Spain forgetting Read more \n \n However, they ruled that too much time had passed for a conviction since Madrigal could not have been unlawfully detained once she became an adult and had only brought her complaint against Vela six years ago. \n \n \u201cAs a consequence of all the above, and noting that the complainant reached her majority on 4 June 1987, and that the statute of limitations for the most serious crime \u2013 unlawful detention \u2013 is 10 years, and that the complaint was brought in April 2012, the crimes have expired under the statue of limitations,\u201d they said in their judgment. \n \n The trial was a test case for the thousands of families who are thought to have been caught up in the illegal practice, which began shortly after Franco\u2019s victory in the civil war and continued until well after the dictator\u2019s death in 1975. \n \n According to some estimates, as many as 300,000 babies may have been taken from their birth mothers and placed with families who supported the Franco regime. Some of the stolen children are thought to have been placed with families in the US and Latin America. \n \n Among those women targeted were single mothers, those with \u201cdegenerate\u201d political views or those from poor backgrounds. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Dr Eduardo Vela. Photograph: web \n \n Madrigal, whose mother told her she was adopted when she turned 18, described the court\u2019s decision as \u201cbittersweet\u201d and said she would appeal against it. \n \n \u201cI feel good because the judges acknowledged the theft, but of course I don\u2019t agree with the statute of limitations point,\u201d she told the Guardian. \n \n Her lawyer, Guillermo Pe\u00f1a, had argued that the statute of limitations should not apply to his client\u2019s case as she had not discovered she had in fact been stolen \u2013 rather than just adopted \u2013 until 2010. \n \n \u201cI didn\u2019t know about any of that in 1987,\u201d said Madrigal. \u201cBut Vela\u2019s lawyer brought up the statute of limitations again and again during the trial \u2013 right from the start. And yet the Madrid provincial court has always been opposed to the statute of limitations and had previously always found in our favour.\u201d \n \n Madrigal said the next step would be an appeal before the supreme court. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep fighting.\u201d \n \n Madrigal said her mother, who died two years ago at the age of 93, had supported her efforts to find justice and answers. \n \n \u201cI always say she didn\u2019t give birth to me but I was born in her heart,\u201d she said before the trial. \u201cShe lived to look after me and see me happy.\u201d \n \n Madrigal, a railway worker and president of the Murcia branch of the SOS Stolen Babies association, had also acknowledged that the proceedings were unlikely to bring her real closure or help her find her birth mother. \n \n Vela, who oversaw the clinic for 20 years, told the court that he could not remember details of how it was run. A policeman who investigated the case concluded that the hospital had been used as a source of trafficked babies, and said that Vela had told him that he had burned the archive files. \n \n Madrigal said she hoped her legal action would be first of many brought by stolen babies and their families, arguing that people like her had been torn from their parents, trafficked and ignored for too long. \n \n She said some of the stolen children had been placed with families in countries including the US, Mexico and Chile. \n \n \u201cWe were Europe\u2019s baby supermarket and babies were stolen for 60 years,\u201d she said.",

A Madrid court ruled that gynecologist Eduardo Vela, 85, had taken newborn Ines Madrigal from her biological mother in 1969 and gave her to another woman who was wrongly certified as Madrigal's birth-mother. But judges said the 10-year statute of limitations for \"unlawful detention\" had expired, since Madrigal became an adult in 1987 and only brought the complaint in 2012, per the Guardian. \"I didn\u2019t know about any of that in 1987,\" says Madrigal. \"But Vela\u2019s lawyer brought up the statute of limitations again and again during the trial\u2014right from the start.\" And Madrigal isn't alone: Thousands of similar cases have been reported, since General Franco's fascist regime allowed doctors to take newborns from \"left-wing\" mothers and give them to pro-Franco families, per the AP. Priests and nuns made lists of parents seeking children while doctors allegedly lied to mothers about what became of their kids. Even post-Franco, Spaniards often kept quiet in a society that respected the Roman Catholic Church and embraced a so-called \"pact of forgetting\" during the 1970s transition to democracy.

    "document": "Skip in Skip x Embed x Share Leaving more questions than answers, 25-year-old Freddie Gray of Baltimore died in police custody after being arrested and suffering a severe injury to the spine. What happened next left his city in turmoil and the nation on edge. VPC \n \n Prince (Photo: NPG Records) \n \n BALTIMORE \u2014 Award winning musician Prince will play a concert in Baltimore Sunday to promote peace following violent protests over the death of Freddie Gray. \n \n The concert is scheduled for 5 p.m. Sunday at the Royal Farms Arena, and will feature special as-yet unannounced guests. Tickets will go on sale Wednesday at 5 p.m. \n \n Concert attendees are being asked to wear something gray. \n \n Gray died April 19 from an unexplained spinal injury while in police custody a week after being arrested for carrying a knife. Protests over his death last week turned into violent riots. \n \n Six Baltimore Police officers were charged Thursday in connection to Gray's death. Their charges range from second degree murder to assault. \n \n Prince has recorded a new song in response to Gray's death and the protest. No release date has been set for the song. \n \n An official statement from spokesperson Yvette Noel-Schure said that the song \"addresses the unrest in Baltimore and the socio/political issues around the country in the wake of a slew of killings of young black men.\" \n \n The song is further described as \"a tribute to all of the people of the city of Baltimore.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1ADAIYB ||||| As dusk fell over Minnesota on Wednesday, many watched details surrounding Freddie Gray's death unfold, while a message resounded from Paisley Park's soundstage. Prince sat at his electric keyboard on the far right of the intricately lit stage. The rest of the venue was dark, mostly. Purple light filtered softly along the venue's perimeters. Adding to an already calming ambiance, the scent of lavender flirted with pleasant hints of sandalwood in the air. \n \n \n \n SOUNDCLOUD: 'Baltimore' \n \n Earlier, afternoon errand-runs were highlighted by an invitation to sit in on \u201crehearsal.\u201d A man who introduced himself as \u201cAnthony\u201d escorted me to the back of the arena. The view was hazy but exquisite in its own right. Guided to sit on a plush purple sofa, here, I was free of expectation. \n \n An earth-toned hat covered the legend's Afro almost completely. The cap matching a vest he wore over a foiled-silver ensemble set in a slate gray silky material. Either way he was fitted for work or play. \n \n Play to Mr. Nelson these days might mean a quick break from the studio to watch his DVR-ed episodes of \u201cNew Girl\u201d in the kitchen, or a seated moment to email a funny meme to a friend, and just maybe a swift bike ride around Chanhassen, Minn. \n \n He and 3rdEyeGirl began their \u201crehearsal\u201d on stage. \n \n \u201cFrom the top,\" he said. \"With a little more life.\u201d \n \n He instructed Ida Nielson on bass, Hanna Welton on drums, Donna Grantis on guitar. Welton's husband, Joshua, who played a significant role in the production of the 2014 album release \u201cArt Official Age,\u201d at a separate board, opposite Prince. \n \n \u201cNobody got in nobody's way,\u201d The Purple One began to sing. \u201cSo I guess you could say it was a good day. At least a little better than the day in Baltimore. Does anybody hear us pray? For Michael Brown or Freddie Gray Peace is more than the absence of war\u2026\u201d \n \n After the first verse, it became abundantly clear this was more performance than \u201crehearsal.\u201d The sound men, technicians and myself quietly watching a live recording of a freshly penned song. \n \n \u201cAre we gonna see another bloody day? We're tired of cryin' and people dyin'. Let's take all the guns away. Absence of war \u2013 you and me. Maybe we can finally say \u2018enough is enough.' It's time for love. It's time to hear, it's time to hear, the guitar play!\u201d \n \n While still seated at the keyboard, Prince then played a tear-evoking electric guitar solo for the remainder of the song. Moved, I quickly wiped an eye as he walked over. \n \n \n \n \u201cCome with me,\" he said. \n \n After leading me inside Studio B he motioned to a red sofa. Peering up I asked, \u201cWhat's it called?\u201c \n \n \u201cBaltimore,\" he replied. \n \n Then he reached for a sip of Blk Water, an alkaline-infused, mineral water for the particularly health conscious. \n \n \u201cWith everything going on there this week, I had a lot I needed to get out,\u201d Prince said. \n \n He then segued into a brief discussion about Joni Mitchell's health scare. \n \n \u201cThat news this week, and what's happening in Baltimore,\u201d he paused, \u201cwell, you know.\u201d \n \n Prince is perhaps one of Joni Mitchell's biggest fans. Recently I learned \"Court & Spark,\" Mitchell's 1974 album release, is one of the artist's top five favorite albums of all time. You may remember the reference to the folk legend in The Ballad of Dorothy Parker on his 1987 release \"Sign O' the Times. \n \n \"'Oh, my favorite song' she said. And it was Joni singing 'Help me I think I'm falling'\" \n \n In a healthy display of emotion, he looked at the studio floor for a second. Fighting tears of his own, Prince politely excused himself to serve water for the both of us. Even in a fleeting moment of sadness, Prince remains magical. More so in his mourning over Joni's condition. Further in his desire for justice, and overall concern for humanity. \n \n Unpleasant times often prod to be channeled into creative expression. Hence, Prince and 3rdEyeGirl's \u201cBaltimore.\" \n \n \n \n This week's turmoil, marked by protests following the violent riots in Baltimore, is still only days old. President Barack Obama this week announced the deaths of black men by police as a \"slow-rolling crisis.\" \n \n The private recording inside Paisley Park is certainly not the first time Prince has weaved social commentary into a performance, or even a brief appearance. With a poignant a five-second sound bite Prince rocked this year's Grammy's. \n \n \"Like books and Black lives, albums still matter,\" he announced before presenting Album of the Year. \n \n The Afro set round, free and proud that night. The sight alone surely had black and brown folks across the country raising power fists from their sofas in solidarity. He stood in a glazed, bright orange, silky-fit to boot. Women swooned, viewers at home rooted on, hearts sang across the world, as Twitter erupted in mainly cathartic response. \n \n No guitar. \n \n Prince's approach to conveying this sort of commentary, however, varies. At the 2013 Billboard Awards during 3rdEyeGirl's performance of \"FixUrLifeUp\" the words \"Gun Control\" were the projected backdrop. This particular night the \"Purple Yoda,\" as he's endearingly known to some, was \u201cfeatured\u201d on lead guitar. \n \n Controversy, Free, When Will We B Paid, Dreamer, Ol' Skool Company. \n \n All among plenty of songs recorded over the years denoting Prince's stance on a variety of societal issues -- stance often left open to listener interpretation. These days it seems \u201cHis Royal Badness\u201d is taking a more direct approach to combat an often silent, yet dangerous, nemesis -- One that seems glumly hovered over the Black Lives Matter movement. \n \n Indifference. \n \n Back on the purple sofa, the definition of \"indifference\" was among an array of multimedia imagery Prince invited me to preview on the soundstage projector screen. \n \n \u201cNoun. Lack of interest, concern, or sympathy: she shrugged, feigning indifference.\u201d \n \n The words faded to blue, a new image appeared on the screen. An audio-visual technician in from Montreal led the preview referring to Mr. Nelson as \u201csir.\u201d The man took notes and feedback earnestly. We viewed approximately 25 bright, distinctive, thought-provoking images. \n \n Prince, 3rdEyeGirl, and crew have been investing at least their latest spring hours recording and rehearsing. The recent rehearsals, I'm told, are to prepare for upcoming, unannounced tours in the United States and abroad. Anticipate \u201cBaltimore\u201d as a likely inclusion. \n \n \u201cWe're going to talk to Jay-Z and his people about streaming it on \u2018Tidal',\u201d he shared with a nod. \n \n \u201cThis is first time we have ever recorded a song live on the soundstage,\u201d Prince added, as we walked toward the studio's parking lot. A proud yet modest smile complemented his shy eyes. \n \n Few can comfortably ignore the current upheaval denouncing chronic cases of police brutality across the country anymore.

    "document": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Poland has long objected to phrases which suggest shared responsibility for Nazi Germany's actions \n \n Poland's Senate has approved a controversial bill making it illegal to accuse the Polish nation or state of complicity in the Nazi Holocaust. \n \n The bill, which sets fines or a maximum three-year jail term as punishment, must be signed off by the president before becoming law. \n \n President Andrzej Duda says Poland has the right \"to defend historical truth\". \n \n But it has outraged Israeli MPs, who are now seeking to strengthen their own Holocaust denial laws. \n \n What does the bill state? \n \n It says that \"whoever accuses, publicly and against the facts, the Polish nation, or the Polish state, of being responsible or complicit in the Nazi crimes committed by the Third German Reich \u2026 shall be subject to a fine or a penalty of imprisonment of up to three years\". \n \n But it adds the caveat that a person \"is not committing a crime if he or she commits such an act as part of artistic or scientific activities\". \n \n It passed in a late-night sitting of the upper house of the Polish parliament with 57 votes to 23, with two abstaining. \n \n The country has long objected to the use of phrases like \"Polish death camps\", which suggest the Polish state in some way shared responsibility for camps such as Auschwitz. The camps were built and operated by Nazi Germany after it invaded Poland in 1939. \n \n But the more contentious point raised by the bill is whether it will outlaw references to acts of individual complicity by Poles with the Nazis - something historians say there is clear evidence for. \n \n What has been the Israeli reaction? \n \n The Israelis are furious about the bill, which Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described as an attempt to rewrite history and deny the Holocaust. \n \n There was particular anger as it came just a few days after the Polish president promised to engage in dialogue with Israel about the bill amid the outcry. \n \n Deputies from across Israel's often fractious political spectrum have united to denounce it. \n \n Opposition MP Tzipi Livni of the Zionist Union party - normally a staunch critic of Mr Netanyahu - said: \"They have spat in Israel's face twice, firstly as the state of the Jewish people that is trying to prevent a second Holocaust, and secondly in the face of an Israeli prime minister who had reached an agreement with his Polish counterpart, and had it ignored.\" \n \n Centrist MP Yair Lapin was also defiant, tweeting that the law could not change history. \n \n Following the passage of the law, Israel's Foreign Ministry asked to postpone the visit of a senior Polish official. \n \n Pavel Solosh, the head of the Polish National Security Council, will not arrive in Israel on Sunday as was planned. \n \n Now, Israeli MPs are backing a bill that would expand Israel's existing Holocaust denial laws to include a five-year jail sentence for anyone denying or minimising the role of Nazi collaborators, including Poles, in crimes committed in the Holocaust. \n \n The amended law would also give legal aid to any Holocaust survivor telling their story who is prosecuted in a foreign country. \n \n The US state department had also urged the Polish government to rethink the bill. \n \n What about in Poland? \n \n Polish politicians have expressed bafflement at the Israeli response. \n \n \"We are very sad and surprised our fight for the truth, for the dignity of Poles, is perceived and interpreted in this way,\" said Senate speaker Stanislaw Karczewski. \n \n Deputy Justice Minister Marcin Warchol said it was wrong to suggest the bill would stop people researching Polish history. \n \n \"Poland is a democratic state of law which respects the freedom of public debate, scientific research, and the right to criticism,\" he said. \n \n Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Poland was committed to combating lies about the Holocaust. \n \n \"The camps where millions of Jews were murdered were not Polish. This truth needs to be protected,\" he said. \n \n Poland is governed by a nationalist party, Law and Justice (PiS), which is keen to show the world how Poland was ruthlessly victimised by its German and Soviet neighbours in the war. \n \n Media reaction to the law has been much more ambivalent. \"Instead of settling the crisis, we have made it even worse,\" said a columnist in the conservative daily Rzeczpospolita. \n \n About 100 Polish artists, politicians and journalists have signed an open letter calling for the repeal of the bill, saying it goes too far in trying to make Poland \"the only blameless nation in Europe\". \n \n Analysis: It's not a black and white issue \n \n by Adam Easton, Warsaw correspondent \n \n \"Polish death camps\" is a depressingly frequent term in the international media, often as a kind of journalistic shorthand. Even President Obama used it in 2012 during a speech honouring a Polish war hero, Jan Karski. Many Poles believe that the user thinks that Poles created and ran the camps. Of course that's not true. \n \n Poland's right-wing government, while acknowledging that some Poles blackmailed Jews in hiding to enrich themselves, is keen to promote the history of Poland as a victim, of not just the Nazis, but also the Soviets. \n \n The government is rightly proud that more Poles are honoured in Israel for saving Jews during the war than citizens of any other nation in occupied Europe. But Polish-Jewish relations during the war were complex - they were neither black nor white. \n \n Historians say individual Poles denounced their Jewish neighbours to the Germans and also took part in their murder. Critics say this bill may act as a muzzle on people trying to uncover the full complexity of the Holocaust. \n \n What happened in World War Two? \n \n Poland was attacked and occupied by Nazi Germany. Millions of its citizens were killed, including three million Polish Jews in the Holocaust. \n \n Six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust overall. \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he strongly opposed the bill \n \n More Poles have been honoured by Israel for saving the lives of Jews during the war than any other nation. \n \n However, historians say others were complicit by acts such as informing on Jews in hiding for rewards, and participating in Nazi-instigated massacres including in Jedwabne where hundreds of Jews were murdered by their neighbours. \n \n A historian and well-known \"Nazi-hunter\" at the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Efraim Zuroff, says the number of collaborators runs into \"many thousands\". \n \n \"The Polish state was not complicit in the Holocaust, but many Poles were,\" Mr Zuroff told the Times of Israel. ||||| Israeli Ambassador to Poland, Anna Azari, standing left, speaks during a eremony markjng the 13th International Day of Commemoration in Memory of the victims of the Holocaust, at the Monument to the Heroes...

(AP Photo/Czarek Sokolowski) (Associated Press) \n \n WARSAW, Poland (AP) \u2014 The United States asked Poland to rethink plans to enact proposed legislation regulating Holocaust speech that has sparked a diplomatic dispute with Israel, arguing Wednesday that if it passes it could hurt freedom of speech as well as strategic relationships. \n \n U.S. State Department spokeswoman Neather Nauert voiced her government's concerns as the Polish Senate was preparing to approve the bill, a step that would put it closer to becoming law.

The resulting divisions that may arise among our allies benefit only our rivals,\" Nauert said. \n \n \"We encourage Poland to reevaluate the legislation in light of its potential impact on the principle of free speech and on our ability to be effective partners.\" \n \n Nauert's statement came only days after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson visited Warsaw, where he paid respects to Jewish and Polish victims of the war on International Holocaust Remembrance Day. \n \n Earlier Wednesday, a U.S. congressional task force on combatting anti-Semitism said it was \"alarmed\" by the legislation and called on Polish President Andrzej Duda to veto it. \n \n \"We are deeply concerned that this legislation could have a chilling effect on dialogue, scholarship, and accountability in Poland about the Holocaust, should this legislation become law,\" the bipartisan group said. \n \n The Poland-Israel dispute, which erupted over the weekend, has elicited bitter recriminations on both sides. Some Israelis have accused the mostly Catholic Poles of being driven by anti-Semitism and of trying to deny the Holocaust. Poles believe they are being defamed by being linked to German crimes of which they were one of the largest group of victims. \n \n The lower house of the Polish parliament approved the bill Friday, a day before International Holocaust Remembrance Day, timing also criticized as insensitive. \n \n Members of Poland's Jewish community weighed in Wednesday, saying in an open letter that they strongly oppose usage of the phrase \"Polish death camps,\" but also oppose the law. \n \n \"As eyewitnesses as well as descendants of the Jewish men and women murdered in the Holocaust, we object to this mendacious expression,\" they wrote. \"What we cannot, however, agree to are provisions which impose prison sentences for the use of an expression.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Monika Scislowska in Warsaw, Randy Herschaft in New York and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report.",

(Courtesy of Morning Newspaper/The Siberian Times) \n \n Rare is the day that Mongolia wades into the international realm. These days, despite the nation\u2019s sweeping size, its population has shriveled to less than 3 million. But every now and then, something remarkable rises out of its storied past \u2014 like a Genghis Khan find \u2014 to grab attention that has long eluded it. \n \n Today is one of those days. \n \n Mongolian scientists, according to reports in the Siberian Times and local Mongol media, are investigating the remains of what researchers describe as the 200-year-old corpse of a monk who was found frozen \u2014 yes \u2014 in lotus position. The monk \u201cis sitting in the lotus position vajra, the left hand is opened, and the right hand symbolizes the preaching Sutra,\u201d Ganhugiyn Purevbata, a professor at the Mongolian Institute of Buddhist Art at Ulaanbaatar Buddhist University, told the Siberian Times. \n \n None of this has been verified independently or described in a peer-reviewed publication. \n \n Though incredible, there is an undeniably rich history of scientists discovering so-called \u201caccidental mummies\u201d in areas of extreme chill like Mongolia. Last year, a 9,000-year-old mummified bison turned up in Siberia. Then some Russian archaeologists dug up a trove of accidental mummies masked under copper plates. Even forces as powerful as decomposition will sometimes stall, it appears, in the face of fierce chills. \n \n Perhaps even for a monk in lotus position. \n \n The Siberian Times, which also originally broke a story about a mysterious Siberian crater, reported the monk was found on Jan. 27 in north central Mongolia. He was covered in cattle skin. \u201cThe mummified body sits in a lotus position, as if still meditating,\u201d Mongolia\u2019s Morning Newspaper said. \u201cExperts that only had time to carry basic visual test say they believe the body can be about 200 years old.\u201d At the time of that report, which hit one week ago, Mongolia\u2019s Morning Newspaper confessed it didn\u2019t know many of the details of the mummified monk\u2019s origins. \n \n But those details now appear to be filling in \u2014 along with a dose of intrigue, geopolitics and mystery. There\u2019s strong suspicion the body belongs to famed Mongol Buddhist monk Dashi-Dorzho Itigilov, who inhabited the rugged Siberian terrain near the border with Mongolia. Born in 1852, his myth was solidified with his death in 1927, the New York Times reported in 2002. \n \n \u201cThen 75 and retired, [he] instructed those gathered around him to \u2018visit and look at my body\u2019 in 30 years,\u201d Times reporter Steven Lee Myers wrote. \u201cHe crossed his legs into the lotus position, began to mediate and, chanting a prayer for the dead, died.\u201d The intervening decades were not kind to the Buddhists inhabiting that area of Russia. Joseph Stalin\u2019s Soviet Union enacted severe crackdowns, executing hundreds of Buddhists and laying waste to their temples. So when the Itigilov\u2019s students came upon his cemetery 30 years after his death as he requested, it wasn\u2019t clear what they would find. \n \n \u201cWhat they found, as the story goes, was Itigilov\u2019s body, still in the lotus position, still perfectly intact, having defied nature\u2019s imperative to decay,\u201d the Times said. \n \n Not knowing what else to do, they fitted the monk\u2019s body back into his crypt. And there it remained for the next 75 years. Then on Sept. 11, 2002, before a small gathering of dozen witnesses, it was pulled free once more. The body was still somehow preserved, which spawned much international speculation. Was it the monk\u2019s genes? Was it his burial process? Was he embalmed? Salt? Soil? Faith? What was it? \n \n \u201cTo me, it is the greatest miracle in life,\u201d spiritual leader Hambo Lama Ayusheyev said. \u201cIt turns out there are things on which time has no power.\u201d \n \n Now, 13 years later, it appears as though the saga of the mummified monk had a final twist. Today\u2019s monk was discovered on a snow-covered estate in Mongolia\u2019s Songinokhairkhan province, but local authorities believe the monk didn\u2019t die there. \u201cPolice have revealed that the monk had been stolen from another part of the country and was about to be sold off,\u201d the Siberian Times reported. \u201cHe had then been planning to sell it on the black market at a \u2018very high price,\u2019 with local [Mongol] media claiming he wanted to take it over the Mongolian border. Police uncovered the plot and quickly arrested a 45-year-old, named only as Enhtor.\u201d \n \n Though local officials suspect that this corpse was, in fact, the remains of Itigilov, many elements of the story remain unclear. How was the monk\u2019s corpse stolen? Who is this mysterious Enhtor? There\u2019s a black market for frozen bodies? \n \n Whatever this story\u2019s resolution \u2014 whether the body is the monk\u2019s corpse, or another monk\u2019s corpse \u2014 the body is now reportedly under guard at Ulaanbaatar\u2019s National Center of Forensic Expertise. \n \n \u201cIf the meditator can continue to stay in this meditative state, he can become a Buddha,\u201d Barry Kerzin, an aide to the Dalai Lama, told the Siberian Times. \u201cReaching such a high spiritual level, the meditator will also help others. And all the people around will feel a deep sense of joy.\u201d",

    "document": "Ricky Gervais and Mel Gibson came face-to-face during the Golden Globes leading to quite the awkward moment. \n \n \u201cI blame NBC for this terrible situation,\u201d Gervais said before bringing Gibson up. \u201cMel blames\u2026well, we know who Mel blames.\u201d \n \n The comedian also joked about Gibson\u2019s alcohol problem, but said he\u2019d rather have a drink with Gibson than Bill Cosby. \n \n After coming out, Gibson responded, \u201cI love seeing Ricky every three years because it reminds me to get a colonoscopy,\u201d which prompted Gervais to return to the stage, making for one of the strangest moments in Globes history. \n \n Gervais, with drink in hand, then put his arm around Gibson and said he had one question. \n \n Bleeped out for audiences at home, Gervais inquired,\u201dWhat the f\u2014 does sugar\u2014s mean?\u201d to awkward laughter from the audience. \n \n Gervais is referencing Gibson\u2019s run-in with the law in 2006. While being arrested for a DUI, Gibson asked a female police officer \u201cwhat do you think you\u2019re looking at, sugar t\u2013s?\u201d \n \n Gervais didn\u2019t just call out Gibson though during his time hosting the award show. His monologue included jabs at Sean Penn, Caitlyn Jenner and \u201cThe Martian\u201d being included as a comedy film. ||||| When Ricky Gervais hosted the Golden Globe awards in 2010 he said \"It's OK folks, I won't be doing this again\" on more than one occasion. His acerbic remarks stunned Hollywood stars more accustomed to flattery and pandering from awards hosts. \n \n But Gervais did do it again. And the second year he hosted the ceremony the jokes were even more painful. The third time was tamer. Now, as Gervais is set to host once more, we round-up some of his best, funniest, and most offensive Golden Globes barbs. \n \n 2010 \n \n The Los Angeles elite had no idea what was about to hit them. \u201cLooking at all the wonderful faces here today reminds me of the great work that\u2019s been done this year\u2026 by cosmetic surgeons,\u201d he said, opening to a smattering of embarrassed titters. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve had some work done, too. I\u2019ve had a penis reduction. Just got the one now. And it is very tiny. But then so are my hands, so when I\u2019m holding it it looks pretty big. \u201d \n \n \u201cActors aren\u2019t just loved here in Hollywood, they are loved the world over. You could be in the third world and get a glimpse of a Hollywood star and it could make you feel a little bit better. You could be a little Asian child with no possessions and no money. But you could see a picture of Angelina Jolie and you\u2019d think, \u2018Mummy!\u2019\u201d \n \n \u201cThis next category is a bit of a downer. It\u2019s for writing. We all know writers get too much credit in Hollywood, when actors mention them. I don\u2019t mean to keep going on about actors, but they\u2019re the most important ones, OK? It\u2019s not the words you say, it\u2019s how good you look when you\u2019re saying them.\u201d \n \n \u201cI hope I haven\u2019t offended anyone. It\u2019s not my fault [points at his drink]. I like a drink as much as the next man. Unless the next man is Mel Gibson.\" \n \n 2011 \n \n It did not take Gervais long to provoke the A-list audience at the Beverly Hilton hotel in Los Angeles. By the time he wound up his four-minute opening, he had managed to insult Johnny Depp, Charlie Sheen, Cher, all the stars of Sex and the City 2, Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Hugh Hefner. \n \n Bruce Willis appeared to be upset when he was later introduced as \"Ashton Kutcher's dad\", but still not content with his night's work, Gervais went on to insult Robert Downey Jr and Tim Allen. Downey Jr summed up the feeling in the auditorium. After the wisecracking host suggested the actor was best known for his time in prison and rehabilitation centres, the Iron Man star said: \"Aside from the fact that it's been hugely mean-spirited with mildly sinister undertones, I'd say the vibe of the show is pretty good so far.\" \n \n \"It's going to be a night of partying and heavy drinking \u2013 or as Charlie Sheen calls it: breakfast.\" \n \n Golden Globes - Leonardo Di Caprio receives standing ovation \n \n \"Everything this year was three-dimensional, except the characters in The Tourist. I feel bad about that joke. I'm jumping on the bandwagon, because I haven't even seen that movie. Who has?\" \n \n \u201cAlso not nominated, I Love You Phillip Morris. Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor, two heterosexual actors pretending to be gay. So the complete opposite of some famous Scientologists, then. My lawyers helped with that joke.\u201d \n \n \"Next up, Eva Longoria has the daunting task of introducing the President of the Hollywood Foreign Press. That's nothing, I just had to help him off the toilet and pop his teeth in.\u201d \n \n \"Talking of the walking dead, congratulations to Hugh Hefner, who is getting married at age 84 to 24-year-old beauty Crystal Harris. When asked why she was marrying him, she said, 'He lied about his age. He told me he was 94'. Just don't look at it when you touch it.\" \n \n 2012 \n \n Despite having toned thing down considerably, he directed what some saw as a homophobic gag at Jodie Foster, the lesbian actress, who co-starred with Mel Gibson in the film The Beaver. \u201cJodie Foster\u2019s Beaver,\u201d he remarked, \u201cI haven't seen it myself. I've spoken to a lot of guys here, they haven't seen it either\u201d. \n \n Later, he became involved in a minor dispute with Madonna, who won Best Original Song, after suggesting that the title of her famous song \u201cLike A Virgin\u201d is at odds with her colourful romantic life. The singer responded: \u201cRicky, if I am just like a virgin why don\u2019t you come over here and do something about it?\u201d \n \n His final gift to broadcasters, who air the programme in primetime on America\u2019s notoriously-sensitive public airwaves, was to swear while discussing the Spanish-speaking Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas. His comment (\u201cI don't know because I can't understand a f**king word they're saying\u201c) was bleeped out. ||||| To Hollywood, California, where the fatted calf is advised to complete its bucket list inside the next 48 hours. By way of consolation, the cause in which it is to be slain could scarcely be more noble: the welcome home of cinema\u2019s Mel Gibson. \n \n Sunday night sees the Golden Globes ceremony take place, and organisers have completed the most uplifting of story arcs by deciding that Mel should be on stage to present an award. We don\u2019t know which award, we don\u2019t know if he has any new material. If I were Mel, I would open with an ice-breaker. Maybe walk to the mic, take a long pause, then arch an eyebrow and shrug: \u201cAnd they say the Jews run Hollywood \u2026\u201d \n \n But, you know, up to Mel. \n \n It must be said that returning Globes host Ricky Gervais has greeted the news of Mel\u2019s involvement with the words: \u201cThank you, Jesus.\u201d So you may care to cast any interaction between the two men as a battle between Ricky\u2019s mischievous atheism and Mel\u2019s ultra-conservative Catholicism. Ricky always has all the best lines, but Mel has a $70m private church compound in the Malibu hills. You get the feeling that if they met in the wilderness, Mel would smite him. \n \n Whichever way you shake it, though, it all caps a stunning \u2013 and stunningly predictable \u2013 return to the Hollywood firmament for Mel. He\u2019s back. Lord knows there was a time when you would have remarked that Mel couldn\u2019t get arrested in Hollywood, except for the fact that arrested was pretty much all he could get. \n \n Mel Gibson to present an award at the Golden Globes Read more \n \n DUI, domestic violence battery: in many ways, Mel was the last great charge-sheet all-rounder, as at home playing a sexist antisemite as he was bringing life to taped recordings featuring threats of homicide, admissions of assault in front of an infant, and deathless observations such as the one that he \u201cdeserve[s] to be blown fast\u201d or arson may ensue. You can never really read anyone else\u2019s relationship, but in Mel\u2019s case there was always the audiobook. \n \n As for how he returned to the fold, there will be a load of theories. But Lost in Showbiz has compiled a personal highlights reel of milestones on the road to industry redemption. \n \n It was cold out there for a few years, despite two starring roles: one in an Edge of Darkness remake, and one in The Beaver, a domestic drama flop about an alcoholic in crisis \u2013 yup \u2013 directed by his friend Jodie Foster. But in 2011, Mel was thrown a high-profile lifeline back to system compliance by drearissimo franchise bore Robert Downey Jr, whose money-shitting turn as Iron Man appears endlessly satisfying to this once-interesting actor. When he was honoured for lifetime achievement at the American Cinematheque Awards, Robert chose Mel to be the one to hand the gong over to him, telling the audience: \u201cI humbly ask that you join me, unless you are completely without sin, and in which case you picked the wrong fucking industry, in forgiving my friend of his trespasses and offering him the same clean slate that you have me and allowing him to continue his great and ongoing contribution to our collective art without shame.\u201d \n \n Their collective art duly moved to allow it, resulting in Gibson starring in the world cinema classic Expendables 3 \u2013 overlooked by the Academy, yes, but still an incredibly moving look at steroid abuse in the senior citizen community. \n \n Mel Gibson has taken on Jesus and Jews. Now for the second world war Read more \n \n The next step involved Mel going back to beginnings and becoming temporarily Australian again, choosing Sydney as the base for his directorial return. Hacksaw Ridge is a second world war movie, which tells the story of a misunderstood religious loner who declines to fight Hitler (yes, I know), but ends up being honoured in the end. Anyway, Australia. For a country that had rather washed its hands of Mel back around the time of the DUI arrest, the move was a bit of a litmus test. But this phase of the road back was judged to be complete when the New South Wales premier himself tweeted: \u201cWelcome back Mel Gibson. New movie Hacksaw Ridge to be filmed in NSW bringing 720 jobs and $26 million.\u201d \n \n Running in tandem to all these penitential acts, of course, has been Gibson\u2019s assiduous purchase of indulgences. Look, it may be his own, aforementioned church (last recorded congregation: 70) to which Mel keeps donating millions of tax-free dollars. But until some reforming entertainer nails 95 theses to the door of Malibu\u2019s heavily fortified Church of the Holy Family, it all counts on the great penance abacus in the sky, OK? \n \n And, ultimately, there was the drawing of lines under stuff. In 2014, Mel used an interview to declare how over he was apologising to the Jews and whatnot. \u201cIt\u2019s an eight-year-old story,\u201d he said of The Unpleasantness on the hard shoulder of a Malibu coastal highway. \u201cIt keeps coming up like a rerun. All the necessary mea culpas have been made copious times,\u201d he ruled. \u201cSo for this question to keep coming up, it\u2019s kind of like \u2026 I\u2019m sorry they feel that way, but I\u2019ve done what I need to do.\u201d \n \n Quite so. The stage is now set for the final chapter in this quasi-redemptive story, in which Mel wins next year\u2019s best actor Golden Globe \u2013 and is presented with it by none other than highway patrol officers Jew and Sugartits.",

Buser/USA TODAY Sports \n \n Tim Tebow has canceled a scheduled appearance at the Dallas megachurch of Robert Jeffress, the controversial pastor whose views on other religions and homosexuality have drawn outrage in recent years. \n \n The New York Jets backup, who likely will be traded or released soon, was scheduled to deliver two sermons on April 28 at the new, $130 million building at First Baptist Dallas Church. The church boasts more than 11,000 congregants. \n \n On Thursday, he tweeted that he would no longer honor the commitment. He didn't specifically say why he was canceling but alluded to the controversy surrounding his appearance: \n \n While I was looking forward to sharing a message of hope and Christ's unconditional love with the faithful members of the historic First Baptist Church of Dallas in April, due to new information that has been brought to my attention, I have decided to cancel my upcoming appearance.

The pastor said Muslims practice a religion that came from the depths of hell and \"promote pedophilia.\" In his eyes, Mormonism is a cult that should have disqualified Mitt Romney from the 2012 election. \n \n The pastor's also very much against homosexuality. \"[It] is perverse, it represents a degradation of a person's mind,\" Jeffress has said. \n \n \"As a Christian pastor, Dr. Jeffress takes a biblical approach to moral and social issues, closely following his duty to preach 'the whole counsel of God,' and not just address issues that are politically correct,\" First Baptist's statement said. \n \n Tebow's planned visit had drawn intense criticism. Rick Chandler of Off the Bench suggests Tebow's appearance is a tacit endorsement of Jeffress' beliefs. Mike Bianchi of the Orlando Sentinel said Tebow risked losing his credibility if he appeared at the church. \n \n To his credit, Tebow seems to have responded to the uproar with a principled stand against Jeffress and he did so without creating more controversy. Some might say his polite cancellation didn't go far enough. He could have bailed on the pastor and issued a strong statement against his beliefs. But that's not Tebow's way.

    "document": "Celebs Elton John admits he cried listening to 'Yellow Brick Road' album again March 31, 2014 at 9:36 AM ET \n \n Tweet email \n \n Sir Elton John's album \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,\" released 40 years ago, was a huge breakthrough for the flamboyant singer/songwriter. The album sold more than 30 million copies \u2014 and even today, is powerful enough to bring John to tears. \n \n During the first part of a chat with TODAY's Matt Lauer Monday, John explained that he'd listened to the record in anticipation of doing interviews about it. The experience, he said, \"Made me very emotional. I cried a little at it, because it reminded me of a time when I was very innocent.\" \n \n But \"Road's\" success was also a gateway into a downward spiral for the then 26-year-old, who began abusing drugs and alcohol after fame swept over him. John has now been sober for more than two decades, and has regrets but no anger. \n \n \"I don't blame anything,\" he said. \"I don't blame anybody or anything. It was just me being inquisitive. ... 'I'll join in. I'll be part of the gang.' Bad decision. If I could go back again, I would never do it.\" \n \n Maybe not the addiction, but John, 67, would still be making music, his \"soul mate.\" He told Lauer music has been with him through \"sadness, through laughter, through love.\" \n \n On Tuesday, the second part of John's interview with TODAY airs, and he'll discuss his upcoming nuptials with partner David Furnish. The pair plan to wed as early as May, now that gay marriage is legal in England. \n \n \"We'll do it very quietly,\" John told Lauer. \"But we will do it and it will be a joyous occasion and we will have our children. \" They have two kids together , Zachary, 3, and Elijah, 1. \n \n \"I'm very proud of Britain and the laws that we've seen come into existence since we've been together , \" John said. \"Having our civil partnership was an incredible breakthrough for people that have campaigned for a long time \u2014 through the '60s and the '50s in England when it was so hard to be gay and hard to be open about it. And it was a criminal act. So for this legislation to come through is joyous, and we should celebrate it. We shouldn't just say, 'Oh, well we have a civil partnership. We're not going to bother to get married.' We will get married.\" \n \n The pair have been in a civil partnership since 2005, which John said had a \"huge impact\" on their commitment. \"We didn't think it would make much difference to our relationship, but it solidified our relationship.\" \n \n Meanwhile, John continues to be as involved in his other relationship \u2014 making music \u2014 as ever. \n \n \"I love it as much now as I did,\" he said. \"I don't like the fame part of it, and I don't like the technology part of it so much. But, the thrill of the music will never die for me ... when you hear somebody young, like Lorde, or someone like that, making a record like she did, and you think, 'You're 16,' I am flabbergasted. And it makes you want to write the best song in the world, because you just cannot believe that this music has come out of someone so young, and so brilliant.\" \n \n Tune in Tuesday on TODAY for the second installment of the two-part interview. \n \n Tweet email ||||| It looks like Elton John and David Furnish will get married in an English registry office in May, with their two kids Elijah and Zachary in tow, plus a few friends. \n \n Furnish told me this news Friday while we sat in a luxurious booth at the Caesars Palace lounge he created, Fizz Las Vegas (the prettiest lounge I\u2019ve ever seen in Vegas, by the way). \n \n Elton and Furnish entered a British civil partnership eight years ago. But today is the first day gay couples can legally wed in England. \n \n \u201cWe don\u2019t feel the need to take an extra step legally. But since we\u2019re committed for life, we feel it\u2019s really important to take that step, and take advantage of that amazing change in legislation. We all live by example,\u201d Furnish said. \n \n I told him I was surprised he and Elton don\u2019t want to throw another big wedding party. \n \n \u201cWe do like big parties,\u201d Furnish said. \u201cOver eight years ago, we had 650 people on the 21st of December at our house in Windsor. \n \n \u201cBut with the kids, everything is different. I think what we\u2019ll do is go to a registry office in England in May, and take the boys with us, and a couple of witnesses.\u201d \n \n Furnish wears large tattoos of the boys\u2019 names on the inside of his forearms in Old Gothic script, \u201cElijah\u201d on the left arm, \u201cZachary\u201d on the right. Elton has their names tattooed on his back, Furnish said. \n \n Furnish, 51, said he and Elton entered a civil partnership as a symbolic way to support the movement that so many people had struggled to achieve, and to acknowledge their commitment to each other. \n \n Civil partnership changed them more than they expected. \n \n \u201cAfter we did it, we felt this amazing sense of commitment and happiness we didn\u2019t anticipate happening. It\u2019s a really nice thing,\u201d Furnish said. \n \n \u201cInitially, the political side of you is like, \u2018No, no, we must have equality.\u2019 When you finally get it, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my god, this feels really nice.\u2019 It\u2019s a lifting thing.\u201d \n \n When Furnish was younger, he never thought he\u2019d get the opportunity to marry. \n \n \u201cI remember trying to come out to my mother and unfortunately going to all the negatives. \u2018You\u2019ll never get married. You\u2019ll never have children. You\u2019ll never be accepted by society. You\u2019ll be prejudiced against. You won\u2019t have a future.\u2019 \n \n \u201cI resigned myself to having a different life. I found it particularly difficult and challenging, because I came from a wonderful marriage; my parents are madly in love still. They\u2019ve been married over 60 years. \n \n \u201cI wanted what they had. I came from a happy union, and I loved the associations I had from that. I felt very loved and encouraged.\u201d \n \n He was frustrated when he found out marriage between two loved ones was forbidden. \n \n \u201cI found it particularly painful.\u201d \n \n But the world is changing. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re living in extraordinary times. My god, 20 years ago, when I started seeing Elton, if you asked me if I\u2019d be able to get married, if I\u2019d be able to have children, it was unthinkable, literally unimaginable.\u201d \n \n Furnish believes people\u2019s exposure to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people through our \u201cmore media-intensive times\u201d has helped many people reexamine previous biases. \n \n \u201cWith access to more information, the barriers come down.\u201d \n \n I said to Furnish I believe we should all send thank-you cards to \u201cWill & Grace\u201d for starting a landslide of public acceptance through that show\u2019s exposure to lovable characters. \n \n \u201cI went to high school with Eric McCormack,\u201d who starred on \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d Furnish said. \u201cWe were in the same drama program together. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s funny how life works, coming from the same little conservative suburb of Toronto, but you find yourself years later in a room in L.A., saying, \u2018OK, I\u2019m in this super high-profile gay relationship, and you\u2019re in this super high-profile gay TV series.

    "document": "\n \n Jon Bon Jovi performing in front of an image of the Dalai Lama in 2011 (YouTube Screenshot) \n \n This post has been updated. \n \n Later this month, the American rock band Bon Jovi was due to play its first shows in mainland China, with concerts planned in Beijing, Shanghai, and Macau. The band's namesake singer, Jon Bon Jovi, celebrated the news by recording a famous Chinese love song in Mandarin, a move that endeared him greatly to fans. \n \n However, just a week before the first concert, promoter AEG Live Asia has announced that the dates in Beijing and Shanghai have been cancelled. The problem? According to a number of sources, the band's performance permits have been pulled. Bon Jovi appears to be the latest American act to run afoul with China's notoriously opaque Ministry of Culture, the body that approves or denies performances and releases by musicians and others. \n \n One source who works in the Chinese music industry says that the permit problem appears to have stemmed from a 2009 music video that featured imagery from the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. \n \n The same source suggested that a video of a 2011 video that showed Bon Jovi performing in front of images of the Dalai Lama, along with other important figures, may also have caught the Ministry of Culture's attention. \n \n Bon Jovi's management was unable to provide comment at the time of writing. In a statement, promoter AEG Live Asia, announced that the shows had been cancelled \"due to unforeseen reasons\" and that there would be a full refund to anyone who bought tickets. \"We would like to apologize for the inconvenience and disappointment that this will cause,\" the statement says. \n \n The news follows a summer of trouble for Western acts in China. In July, the Los Angeles-based band Maroon 5 canceled shows planned in Beijing and Shanghai in September. There was no official reason given for the change in Maroon 5's plans, but many speculated that permits had been pulled after Jesse Carmichael, the band's keyboard player, attended the Dalai Lama's birthday party in California and tweeted about it. China regards the Tibetan spiritual leader as a separatist due to his calls for autonomy for the Himalayan region. \n \n Less than a month later, American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift faced scrutiny after planning to sell merchandise featuring her initials and the name of her album,\"1989,\" direct to fans in China. There was no political message intended by Swift's merchandize, but in China the events might be seen as reference to the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests of 1989, where hundreds if not thousands of civilians were killed when the Chinese army moved in to clear the square. \n \n Western performers in China have sparked political controversies before: In 2008, Icelandic singer Bjork was criticized by the Ministry of Culture after she chanted pro-Tibet slogans at a concert in Shanghai. A number of musical acts, including American singer Bob Dylan and British band Oasis, subsequently had to cancel tours due to their perceived political leanings. \n \n However, those involved in organizing the events say there seems to have been an unusually high number of events canceled at the last minute this year. \u201cThis put the fear into all of us,\u201d Archie Hamilton, a festival promoter in Beijing, told the Associated Press in May. \u201cEveryone\u2019s afraid of getting it wrong and losing a lot of money.\" \n \n For some Chinese music fans, the news that yet another act had cancelled their shows hit hard. \"I booked flight tickets from Shenzhen to Shanghai in June [when tickets went on sale],\" a fan complained on Weibo. \"No words I've learned could express how crushed I am.\" Others complained, perhaps sarcastically, that it was the Dalai Lama's fault. \n \n \"Better go abroad if you want to go to concerts,\" one exasperated fan wrote. \"Too risky in China.\" \n \n Xu Yangjingjing contributed to this report. \n \n More on WorldViews \n \n Taylor Swift\u2019s next feud might be with the Chinese government \n \n How Justin Bieber inadvertently stepped into one of the world\u2019s greatest geopolitical controversies ||||| Ageing rock band Bon Jovi has had the plug pulled on its first concerts in China after officials learnt that a picture of the Dalai Lama had featured in a video backdrop in a concert five years ago. \n \n The abrupt cancellation of two concerts next week in Shanghai and Beijing \u2014 with tickets ranging from Rmb480 to Rmb3,880 ($75 to $600) \u2014 makes the enduring American rockers the latest musicians to fall foul of Chinese sensitivities. \n \n The illustrious list includes Icelandic singer Bj\u00f6rk and Maroon 5, which had its Shanghai concert cancelled earlier this year. That followed a band member\u2019s tweet about meeting the Tibetan spiritual leader. Twitter is also banned in China. \n \n The Communist party\u2019s Culture Ministry acted after discovering that Bon Jovi once included a picture of the Dalai Lama in a video backdrop during a concert in Taiwan in 2010, according to people familiar with the matter. \n \n China\u2019s leaders revile the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader as a \u201csplittist\u201d and a \u201cwolf in monk\u2019s robes\u201d, and accuse him of advocating Tibetan independence from his base in neighbouring India. \n \n The Chinese government regularly bans artists, academics and political leaders from going to China if they are seen as supportive of the Dalai Lama or the Tibetan independence movement. \n \n Sino-British relations were put into the diplomatic deep freeze for more than a year after British Prime Minister David Cameron met the Dalai Lama in 2012. \n \n On Tuesday concert organisers were desperately trying to convince officials to relent on the Bon Jovi concerts but the chances of Beijing overturning the cancellation order are slim, according to people familiar with the matter. \n \n A representative from AEG, the promoter of the Bon Jovi concerts in China, said it was unable to comment on the cancellation order as it was waiting for more information. \n \n In an interview with Chinese state media before the Culture Ministry cancellation order, frontman Jon Bon Jovi described the band\u2019s music as being about \u201cindividual freedom and expression\u201d. The band\u2019s upcoming album is called Burning Bridges. \n \n Tibet\u2019s Panchen Lama \u2018living normal life\u2019, says China Beijing insists revered Buddhist figure detained aged 6 in 1995 \u2018does not wish to disturbed\u2019 Read more \n \n The issue of Tibet is especially sensitive now as the ruling Communist party holds celebrations, amid extremely tight security, to mark the 50th anniversary of the founding of the so-called Tibet Autonomous Region, which came under direct Chinese control in the early 1950s. \n \n As part of the celebrations, a top Chinese official vowed on Monday to \u201ccrack down on separatist forces\u201d in Tibet and \u201cfight a protracted battle\u201d against the \u201cDalai clique\u201d. \n \n Bj\u00f6rk has been banned from China for life after she chanted \u201cTibet, Tibet\u201d during her song \u201cDeclare Independence\u201d in a concert in Shanghai in 2008. \n \n Other celebrities who are not welcome in China because of their real or perceived sympathy towards Tibet and the Dalai Lama include Richard Gere, Sharon Stone and Brad Pitt. \n \n It was unclear whether concertgoers would receive refunds if the concerts do not go ahead.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It seems the Dalai Lama has indirectly led to the disappointment of Chinese concertgoers once again. One week before Bon Jovi was to play a three-city tour of China\u2014the band's first-ever shows in the country\u2014two of the shows were mysteriously canceled, the Washington Post reports. This despite Jon Bon Jovi having already recorded a love song in Mandarin for the occasion. Concert promoter AEG Live Asia cited \"unforeseen circumstances,\" but reports are putting the blame on China's Ministry of Culture, which pulled Bon Jovi's permits after seeing a video of the band performing in front of images of the Dalai Lama in 2010 or 2011, reports the Financial Times. However, a 2009 Bon Jovi music video featuring images from the Tiananmen Square protest could also have been problematic, per the Post. Concert organizers are trying to get the decision reversed, but that's unlikely, notes the Times. \"No words I've learned could express how crushed I am,\" one disappointed Chinese Bon Jovi fan posted on social media, per the Post. Chinese Maroon 5 fans know the feeling: Adam Levine and Co. also lost their permits this summer, with a band member's tweet about attending the Dalai Lama's birthday party in California the likely culprit. Taylor Swift likewise ran into trouble for planning to sell merch featuring her initials and 1989 album title; Tiananmen Square took place in 1989, notes the Post.",

    "document": "CLOSE On Tuesday, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced its 2017 nominees. And, that means there were some snubs! Time \n \n Director/writer Martin Scorsese and Andrew Garfield on the set of 'Silence.' (Photo: Kerry Brown) \n \n La La Land and diversity were major winners in Tuesday's Oscar nominations, but not everyone woke up to an avalanche of excited texts. Among the most surprising omissions from this year's crop: \n \n Silence. Despite its muted box office ($5.2 million since late December) and shutout at the Golden Globes, we still figured Martin Scorsese\u2019s passion project might have a shot with the Academy, given the director\u2019s prodigious 12 Oscar nods (and one win) to date. But the religious epic ultimately fell on deaf ears, eking out just one nomination for best cinematography. \n \n Amy Adams. Once considered an on-the-bubble contender, the five-time Oscar nominee gained momentum in the past month thanks to Arrival's strong showing with industry and critics' groups. But the overdue actress' understated performance as a linguistics expert may not have been flashy enough for voters, who otherwise greeted the sci-fi drama with eight nominations including best picture. \n \n Finding Dory. Stellar reviews and more than $1 billion at the global box office couldn't help the Disney/Pixar blockbuster swim to a nomination for best animated feature \u2014 a category its predecessor, Finding Nemo, dominated in 2004. \n \n Denzel Washington. The dynamic Fences star earned his seventh acting Oscar nod for his acclaimed August Wilson adaptation with Viola Davis, but was edged out of best director by comeback kid Mel Gibson (Hacksaw Ridge) and first-time nominee Denis Villeneuve (Arrival). \n \n Annette Bening. Not only is she a four-time Oscar nominee, but the 20th Century Women star is also a member of the Academy's Board of Governors as a representative for the Actors Branch. So how did she miss out on Nomination No. 5? Blame it on a crowded field of other well-respected actresses including Meryl Streep (Florence Foster Jenkins) and French icon Isabelle Huppert (Elle), both of whom have showier roles than Bening's '70s matriarch. \n \n Deadpool. For a second there, it looked like the Merc with a Mouth might actually score a nomination for best picture, given the underdog's surprising inclusion in Golden Globes and guild nominations. But even with the boost of Ryan Reynolds' delightfully unconventional awards campaign, the R-rated superhero couldn't go the distance. \n \n Aaron Taylor-Johnson. After picking up best supporting actor at the Golden Globes, Johnson was passed over for his creepy Nocturnal Animals turn in favor of his wry co-star, Michael Shannon. Tom Ford's stylish second feature was otherwise missing from the nominations, despite recent love from the BAFTA Awards and the Writers Guild of America. \n \n Taraji P. Henson. Arriving at the tail end of awards season, Hidden Figures blasted off at the box office with $83.7 million (and counting) since late December and four nominations including best picture and best supporting actress (Octavia Spencer). But the Empire star couldn't manage a best-actress nod for her powerful turn as NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson, nor could her other well-reviewed co-stars Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Kevin Costner in supporting categories. \n \n Sully. Clint Eastwood's workmanlike take on the Miracle on the Hudson hasn't been a major awards player in months, despite its inclusion on the National Board of Review's top 10 films of the year list. Still, its shutout in major categories is surprising given its stellar box office ($125.1 million) and likable star in Tom Hanks, who was once again overlooked for best actor after recent high-profile snubs for Bridge of Spies and Captain Phillips. \n \n CLOSE Here are the best picture nominees for the 89th Academy Awards. USA TODAY NETWORK \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2koQDbA ||||| The Oscars certainly knows how to keep us on our toes. \n \n While movies like La La Land and Manchester by the Sea are up for awards in several categories, as expected, this year\u2019s Academy Award nominations were full of many notable snubs and surprises. While actors Taraji P. Henson, Amy Adams and Hugh Grant were overlooked, Viggo Mortensen managed to snag a spot in the Best Actor category. And at yet another awards show, Finding Dory couldn\u2019t make it despite its pledge to \u201cjust keep swimming.\u201d \n \n Keep reading for a breakdown of the biggest shocks from this morning\u2019s announcement leading up to the biggest night in films. \n \n Snub: Taraji P. Henson \n \n The math just doesn\u2019t add up. \n \n Despite Hidden Figures receiving such positive reviews, lead actress Henson failed to score a nomination for her portrayal of Katherine Johnson, the African-American mathematician who helped send the first American astronauts into space. \n \n Janelle Mon\u00e1e was also sidelined despite a solid performance. \n \n The musician and producer was nominated for a Golden Globe for best original score for Hidden Figures. However, his work was overlooked in the Oscars\u2019 Original Score and Best Original Song categories. \n \n The awards show wasn\u2019t a total miss for Hidden Figures, though: After Henson\u2019s snub, the film \u2014 which nabbed a nomination for outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture at for Screen Actors Guild Awards \u2014 pulled through with a spot in the Best Picture category. \n \n In addition, Octavia Spencer received a mention in the Best Supporting Actress category. \n \n Snub: Amy Adams \n \n Despite a critically acclaimed performance in Arrival, the five-time Oscar nominee won\u2019t have another shot at taking home the statue this year. In a tight Best Actress category that included Meryl Streep, Natalie Portman and Emma Stone, Adams failed to make an appearance. \n \n Emily Blunt, who received recognition for the SAG Awards, also didn\u2019t make the cut \u2014 although that would have been a bigger shock. \n \n Snub: Annette Bening \n \n The four-time Oscar nominee was another overlooked contender in the packed Best Actress division. Her acclaimed film 20th Century Women also came up short across the board, failing to secure any Oscar nods. \n \n It\u2019s been 21 years since Gibson, who welcomed his ninth child last week, won Best Picture and Best Director for Braveheart. Despite a series of controversies in the early 2000s, nominations for Best Director and Best Picture for Hacksaw Ridge (Gibson\u2019s first directorial effort since 2006\u2019s Apocalypto) have solidified his comeback to Hollywood. \n \n \u201cWhat could be more exciting than listening to the nominations being announced while holding my newborn son! This is a truly wonderful honor,\u201d Gibson said in a statement. \n \n Snub: Hugh Grant \n \n The Florence Foster Jenkins actor will have to wait a bit longer for his first Oscar nomination. \n \n Despite SAG and BAFTA nominations for best supporting actor and a Golden Globes lead actor spot, Grant failed to secure a slot. Instead, Michael Shannon snagged the final opening in the best Best Supporting Actor category for his role in Nocturnal Animals. (Shannon\u2019s costar in that film, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, won the category at the Golden Globes but did not make the cut for the Academy Awards.) \n \n RELATED VIDEO: La La Land Leads! Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone Musical Nabs Record-Tying 14 Oscar Nominations \n \n Surprise: Viggo Mortensen \n \n Mortensen said it best himself: \u201cIt\u2019s the little movie that could.\u201d \n \n After the Captain Fantastic actor scored a Golden Globe nomination for his role as the patriarch of a family who is forced to reintegrate into society after living in isolation for a decade, the Screen Actors Guild also honored Mortensen with a nod for outstanding performance by a male actor in a leading role for the summer comedy. Mortensen can now add \u201cOscar nominee\u201d to his resume. \n \n Snub: Finding Dory \n \n The Pixar sequel fans waited 13 years for the sequel, but it just couldn\u2019t swim its way into awards season. The forgetful yet lovable fish voiced by Ellen DeGeneres scored with reviewers and at the box office (it\u2019s earned over $1 billion worldwide), but was edged out in a year full of strong contenders in the best animated feature film category, including Disney\u2019s Moana and Zootopia. \n \n Awards season gave no love for Sully. \n \n After being left out of both the Golden Globes and the SAG Awards, fans hoped that the Miracle on the Hudson movie would be able to nab a couple nominations at the Oscars, but there was no such luck. Neither director (and Academy golden boy) Clint Eastwood nor Hanks, a two-time Best Actor winner, were recognized. ||||| Story highlights There was more diversity this year \n \n #OscarsLessWhite became a popular hashtag \n \n (CNN) Is it time for a new hashtag? \n \n This year's Oscar nominations have thrust the conversation about diversity back into the limelight, but this time in a more positive context. \n \n Seven actors of color were nominated Tuesday -- Denzel Washington and Viola Davis for \"Fences,\" Mahershala Ali and Naomie Harris for \"Moonlight,\" Ruth Negga for \"Loving,\" Dev Patel for \"Lion\" and Octavia Spencer for \"Hidden Figures.\" \n \n Davis is now a three-time Oscar nominee, a first for an African American woman. ||||| Nominations for the 89th Academy Awards were announced this morning in L.A., and if you are La La Land, Moonlight\u2018s Mahershala Ali or Elle\u2018s Isabelle Huppert, you\u2019re probably feeling a mountain high \u2014 just like most of the Hollywood film industry now attending the Sundance Film Festival. However, for others including Silence director Martin Scorsese, Hidden Figures star Taraji P. Henson and Arrival\u2018s Amy Adams, their Oscars hopes just got buried. \n \n Here are some of the most significant people and projects snubbed this year for the Oscars, which will be held February 26 on ABC and hosted by Jimmy Kimmel. Tell us who you think we might have missed. \n \n Martin Scorsese \u2013 Denied a Golden Globe nomination and a DGA Awards nom, the silence is deafening on the Silence director this morning. Has the faith been lost? \n \n Sully \u2013 The heroic story of pilot Chesley Sullenberger\u2019s 2009 emergency landing of a US Airways flight on the Hudson River, and everyone on board escaping safely, was borderline miraculous. The fact that star and multiple Oscar winner Tom Hanks, director and multiple Oscar winner Clint Eastwood, and the film\u2019s box office success were overlooked in the major categories is nothing short of a sin. \n \n Michael Keaton \u2013 The past nominee deserved a break today for his performance as McDonald\u2019s mogul Ray Kroc in The Founder. But no Happy Meal there. \n \n Taraji P. Henson \u2013 The math just didn\u2019t add up with Academy members for the Empire star\u2019s performance as NASA human computer Katherine Johnson. Her Hidden Figures character helped get John Glenn into space and back home safely and received a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015, but not even a chance at a reward for past nominee Henson. Congrats to co-star and previous Oscar winner Octavia Spencer on her Best Supporting Actress nom though. \n \n The King\u2019s Choice \u2013 Norway\u2019s big Oscar hope for Best Foreign Language Film tells the true tale of the monarch who resisted Hitler and the Nazis in some of the darkest days of WWII. History should never forget King Haakon VII, but Oscar voters sure did. \n \n Amy Adams \u2013 Strangely there won\u2019t be an Academy arrival this year for the Arrival actress even though the Denis Villeneuve-helmed movie picked up Best Picture and Best Director noms among six others. \n \n Matthew McConaughey \u2013 The actor radically transformed himself for Gold, but this past Best Actor winner did not find Oscar paydirt today. \n \n Annette Bening \u2013 The previous Best Supporting Actress nominee didn\u2019t see any 21st century appreciation this year for 20th Century Women. \n \n Kevin Costner \u2013 The Dances With Wolves winner was the hidden weapon of Hidden Figures but didn\u2019t take flight for his role in the NASA civil rights pic. \n \n Trolls \u2013 Academy members really know just how to stop the Animated Feature feeling, don\u2019t they? And don\u2019t tell me that Original Song nomination was all this DreamWorks Animation flick deserved. \n \n Adam Driver \u2013 The Star Wars alum put on a forceful campaign for his poetic New Jersey bus driver lead in Jim Jarmusch\u2019s Paterson, but Oscar wasn\u2019t along for the ride. \n \n Tom Ford \u2013 The Nocturnal Animals helmer saw his well-appointed film win the Grand Jury Prize at Venice and score Golden Globe nominations (including for Ford himself) and nine BAFTA noms. But the designer and director won\u2019t be wearing Oscar gold. \n \n Eye In The Sky \u2013 Maybe it\u2019s because the last film appearance of Alan Rickman was released in March, or maybe it was the topic of drone warfare, but the Helen Mirren-starring pic didn\u2019t fly with voters. \n \n Hugh Grant \u2013 The Florence Foster Jenkins star landed SAG and BAFTA nominations for Best Supporting Actor and a Golden Globes Lead Actor nom, but it was an Oscar funeral for Grant today. \n \n \u201cI See A Victory\u201d \u2013 The Hidden Figures tune from 2014 nominee Pharrell Williams is a foot tapper and a musical window into the film\u2019s subject of equality. Still, no one ever accused Oscar voters of having too much introspection or swing at the same time, and they proved it again with this snub. \n \n Deadpool \u2013 Yes, he comes out of the superheroes of the Marvel Universe, but you know in your heart that the merc with a mouth deserved to see the genre barrier broken with a Best Picture nomination. Almost never made, the witty and unconventional Fox pic was a real Hollywood success story for star Ryan Reynolds and director Tim Miller. Blockbusters are movies too, AMPAS members. \n \n Aaron Taylor Johnson \u2013 A Golden Globes win for the Nocturnal Animals actor and a BAFTA nomination, but nothing from Oscar. \n \n The Birth Of A Nation \u2013 Just one day short of a year ago, the pic starring and directed by Nate Parker about the 1831 Nat Turner-led slave rebellion debuted at Sundance and was garlanded with Oscar hopes. A record-breaking pickup by Fox Searchlight followed and then Audience and Grand Jury Sundance awards, and it looked like TBOAN was a contender. Then a 1999 sexual assault allegation against Parker resurfaced, plus box office disappointment. And even with a first-time feature directing nom from the DGA, Birth was ignored by Academy members.",

But hours later, Coast Guard Cmdr. Cheri Ben-Iesau said crews were unable to find any spill. \n \n The company that owns the platform, Houston-based Mariner Energy, did not know what caused the blast. \n \n Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said Mariner officials told him there were seven active production wells on the platform, and they were shut down shortly after the fire broke out. \n \n The Coast Guard said Mariner Energy reported the oil sheen. But the company said in a public statement that an initial flyover of the platform did not reveal any spilled oil. \n \n Photos from the scene showed at least five ships floating near the platform.

Its location is considered shallow water, much less than the approximately 5,000 feet where BP's well spewed oil and gas for three months after the April rig explosion. \n \n Responding to any oil spill in shallow water would be much easier than in deep water, where crews depend on remote-operated vehicles access equipment on the sea floor. \n \n A homeland security update obtained by The Associated Press said the platform was producing 58,800 gallons of oil and 900,000 cubic feet of gas per day. The platform can store 4,200 gallons of oil. \n \n White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the administration has \"response assets ready for deployment should we receive reports of pollution in the water.\" \n \n Crew members were found floating in the water, huddled together in insulated survival outfits called \"Gumby suits\" for their resemblance to the cartoon character. \n \n \"These guys had the presence of mind, used their training to get into those Gumby suits before they entered the water,\" Coast Guard spokesman Chief Petty Officer John Edwards said. \n \n The crew was being flown to a hospital in Houma. The Coast Guard said one person was injured, but the company said there were no injuries. \n \n A company report said the well was drilled in the third quarter of 2008. \n \n There are about 3,400 platforms operating in the Gulf, according to the American Petroleum Institute. Together they pump about a third of the America's domestic oil, forming the backbone of the country's petroleum industry. \n \n Platforms are vastly different from oil rigs like the Deepwater Horizon. They are usually brought in after wells are already drilled and sealed. \n \n \"A production platform is much more stable,\" said Andy Radford, an API expert on offshore oil drilling. \"On a drilling rig, you're actually drilling the well. You're cutting. You're pumping mud down the hole. You have a lot more activity on a drilling rig.\" \n \n In contrast, platforms are usually placed atop stable wells where the oil is flowing at a predictable pressure, he said. A majority of platforms in the Gulf do not require crews on board. \n \n Many platforms, especially those in shallower water, stand on legs that are drilled into the sea floor. Like a giant octopus, they spread numerous pipelines across the sea floor and can tap into many wells at once. \n \n Platforms do not have blowout preventers, but they are usually equipped with a series of redundant valves that can shut off oil and gas at different points along the pipeline. \n \n Numerous platforms were damaged during hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The storms broke pipelines and oil spilled into the Gulf. But the platforms successfully kept major spills from happening, Radford said. \n \n \"Those safety valves did their job,\" he said. \n \n Federal authorities have cited Mariner Energy and related entities for 10 accidents in the Gulf of Mexico over the last four years, according to safety records from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. \n \n The accidents range from platform fires to pollution spills and a blowout, according to accident-investigation reports from the agency formerly known as the Minerals Management Service. \n \n In 2007, welding sparks falling onto an oil storage tank caused a flash fire that slightly burned a contract worker. The Minerals Management Service issued a $35,000 fine. \n \n Mariner Energy Inc. focuses on oil and gas exploration and production in the Gulf. In April, Apache Corp., another independent oil company, announced plans to buy Mariner in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $3.9 billion, including the assumption of about $1.2 billion of Mariner's debt. That deal is pending. \n \n On Friday, BP was expected to begin the process of removing the cap and failed blowout preventer, another step toward completion of a relief well that would put a final seal on the well. The Deepwater Horizon exploded April 20, killing 11 people and setting off a three-month leak that totaled 206 million gallons of oil. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Janet McConnaughey in New Orleans, Chris Kahn in New York, Eileen Sullivan, Matthew Daly and Gerry Bodlander in Washington, Garance Burke in Fresno, Calif., and researcher Monika Mathur in New York contributed to this report. ||||| The Coast Guard says there is no sign of an oil leak after the latest Gulf platform fire, but crews are continuing to monitor the situation. \n \n Enlarge By Gerald Herbert, AP Boats spray water on an oil and gas platform that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana on Thursday. Enlarge By Patrick Semansky, AP Two oil rig workers, left, walk away from the U.S. Coast Guard helicopter that rescued them after an oil production platform exploded in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday. The helicopter landed on the roof of Terrebonne General Medical Center in Houma, La. All 13 crew members survived the explosion. An offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico that exploded Thursday did not leak a significant amount of oil into the water, the Coast Guard said. All 13 rig workers donned bright orange survival gear \u2014 known as \"Gumby suits\" \u2014 and scrambled into the Gulf after the explosion. They were rescued by a supply ship, Coast Guard Capt. Peter Troedsson said. None were seriously injured. The owner of the oil and gas platform, Mariner Energy of Houston, reported that a mile-long slick was visible on the water near the rig. When the Coast Guard reached the scene a short time later, there was no evidence of any leaks, Troedsson said. \"The boats and the aircraft on scene cannot see a sheen,\" he said. The outcome of the explosion was very different from the April 20 explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig 200 miles to the east. That well, owned by oil company BP, spewed crude oil and natural gas for nearly three months in the worst offshore environmental disaster in U.S. history. About 206 million gallons of oil polluted the Gulf. The Vermilion Oil Rig 380 that exploded Thursday sat in 340 feet of water and was approved to collect oil and gas from existing wells, according to the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement. It was undergoing maintenance and was not producing at the time of the accident. ON DEADLINE: Oil rig explosion news as it happens DEEPWATER SPILL: Engineers retrieve failed blowout preventer FULL COVERAGE: Tracking the oil spill By contrast, the Deepwater Horizon was operating in more than 5,000 feet of water and was drilling into extremely deep reservoirs under high pressure. Thursday's explosion was reported at 9:19 a.m. by a nearby rig, Troedsson said. The blast occurred 92 miles south of Vermilion Bay, La., west of New Orleans and the Mississippi River Delta. Dan Shaw, the captain of the Crystal Clear supply boat that rescued Vermilion's workers, said the employees huddled together in the water, holding hands. They were hungry and tired after floating for two hours, he said. Mariner Energy describes itself on its website as \"one of the leading independent oil and gas exploration and production companies in the Gulf.\" The company was involved in 13 accidents in the region since 2006 and was fined $85,000, according to federal records. In seven of the incidents, inspectors cited possible safety violations. Thursday's explosion prompted swift reactions from environmentalists. \"This is one other piece of evidence that demonstrates the human and environment risks of our appetite for offshore oil,\" said Susan Farady, director of the Marine Affairs Institute at Roger Williams University School of Law in Rhode Island. She said there have been more than 800 offshore explosions and fires in the Gulf since 2001 and 55 deaths. Meanwhile, workers took another step Thursday toward permanently plugging BP's well. They prepared to remove the well's giant blowout preventer from the seafloor as soon as Thursday night, said retired admiral Thad Allen, head of the federal government's response.

He even adopted North Korea\u2019s description of the exercises as \u201cvery provocative.\u201d \n \n The next military exercise with South Korea had been set for next spring, though the status of that operation, codenamed Foal Eagle, is uncertain, since the US had announced shortly after the June 12 summit that all exercises had been canceled indefinitely.

The State Department did not respond immediately to a request for comment. \n \n \u201cAs you know, we took the step to suspend several of the largest exercises as a good-faith measure coming out of the Singapore summit,\u201d he told reporters at the Pentagon. \u201cWe have no plans at this time to suspend any more exercises.\u201d \n \n In another sign that the Trump administration\u2019s negotiations with North Korea are faltering, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Tuesday said large-scale military exercises with South Korea are back on the table \u2014 less than three months after the summit between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. \n \n \u201cIt will be a total denuclearization, which is already starting taking place.\u201d \u2014President Trump on June 21 \n \n \u201cUnder the circumstances that we\u2019re negotiating ... I think it\u2019s inappropriate to be having war games,\u201d Trump said, in a concession that reportedly blindsided many US allies as well as some in his own military. \n \n \n \n The Pentagon formally announced that the US had \u201cindefinitely suspended\u201d the long-planned military exercises in South Korea on June 22, including Ulchi Freedom Guardian and two others that were scheduled to take place over the summer. The annual exercises are seen as the focal point of the \u201cironclad\u201d US\u2013South Korea alliance to defend against North Korean aggression. \n \n Further decisions would depend on North Korea \u201ccontinuing to have productive negotiations in good faith,\u201d the Pentagon said at the time. \n \n Asked on Tuesday whether the decision to resume war game operations suggested that North Korea was \u201cacting in bad faith,\u201d Mattis hedged, countering \u201cnot at all, but we did what we did at the time for that purpose.\u201d \n \n He refused to answer whether turning the military exercises \u201cback on\u201d would be seen as a provocation given the president\u2019s characterization. \n \n \u201cWe're not turning them back (\u2026) on. They've never been turned off,\u201d Mattis said, explaining that only specific exercises had been suspended. \u201cWe are going to see how the negotiations go, and then we'll calculate the future, how we go forward.\u201d \n \n It was not immediately clear what this would mean in practice, and the Pentagon did not respond to BuzzFeed News\u2019 request for further details. \n \n The US military opening the door to resuming the massive military exercises is the latest in a series of decisions by the Trump administration in recent weeks indicating that little progress has been made since the summit, which the president prematurely touted as a \u201ctremendous success.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt will be a total denuclearization, which is already starting taking place,\u201d Trump said at a cabinet meeting on June 21, adding that it was beginning \u201cimmediately\u201d \u2014 contradicting Mattis, who was sitting next to him at the same table. \n \n Last week, just a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced a new special representative to take charge of negotiations with Kim\u2019s regime and said they would both be traveling to North Korea, Trump canceled the visit in a tweet. \n \n \u201cI have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea, at this time, because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,\u201d the president said in a series of tweets. \n \n It seemed to be a reversal of Trump\u2019s high-spirited declaration after the summit in June that \u201cthere is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.\u201d \n \n Asked whether he agreed with the president\u2019s assessment on Tuesday, Mattis did not answer directly. \n \n \u201cYou're asking for a straightforward answer on a complex subject,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bottom line is, there was progress made. The whole world saw that progress when the two leaders sat down. We also knew very clearly this was going to be a long and challenging effort to negotiate this away.\u201d \n \n He deferred all questions on the status of North Korea\u2019s denuclearization to Pompeo, saying the Pentagon was only playing a \u201csupporting role.\u201d ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military has no plans yet to suspend any more major military exercises with South Korea, the defense secretary said on Tuesday, in the middle of a breakdown in diplomacy with North Korea over its nuclear weapons. \n \n Defense Secretary James Mattis told a Pentagon news conference that no decisions had been made about major exercises for next year but noted that the suspension of drills this summer as a good-faith gesture to North Korea was not open-ended. \n \n U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s June decision to unilaterally suspend the drills caught many American military planners off guard and was broadly criticized as a premature concession to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who Trump wants to give up his nuclear weapons. \n \n \u201cWe took the step to suspend several of the largest exercises as a good-faith measure coming out of the Singapore summit,\u201d Mattis told reporters, referring to the June 12 meeting between Trump and Kim. \n \n \u201cWe have no plans at this time to suspend any more exercises,\u201d he said, adding that no decisions had yet been made on major exercises for next year. \n \n Mattis also said smaller exercises deemed to be exempt from the suspension were ongoing. \n \n Mattis\u2019 comments on the drills come at a delicate time for negotiations between the United States and North Korea after Trump scrapped plans for a meeting between top officials from both countries. \n \n At the June summit, the first meeting between a serving U.S. president and a North Korean leader, Kim agreed in broad terms to work toward denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. But North Korea has given no indication it is willing to give up its weapons unilaterally as the Trump administration has demanded. \n \n Since then, diplomats have failed to advance the process. \n \n North Korean officials even warned in a letter to U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week that denuclearization talks risked falling apart, U.S. officials told Reuters. \n \n In particular, the North wants steps toward a peace treaty. The 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty, leaving U.S.-led U.N. forces technically still at war with North Korea. \n \n U.S. officials fear North Korea might turn its attention to cutting a separate deal with South Korea and driving a wedge between the U.S.-South Korea alliance. \n \n STALEMATE \n \n A South Korea presidential spokesman acknowledged that talks between Washington and Pyongyang were at a stalemate. \n \n \u201cWith North Korea and the U.S. remaining stalemated, there is an even bigger need for an inter-Korea summit,\u201d Kim Eui-kyeom, a spokesman for the presidential Blue House, told a briefing. \n \n South Korean President Moon Jae-in said this month his planned third summit with North Korea\u2019s Kim next month would be another step toward the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and an end to the Korean War. \n \n FILE PHOTO: Amphibious assault vehicles of the South Korean Marine Corps travel during a military exercise as a part of the annual joint military training called Foal Eagle between South Korea and the United States in Pohang, South Korea, April 5, 2018. REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo \n \n \u201cSecretary Mattis\u2019 comment appears to be an extension of the previous U.S.-South Korea agreement concerning the postponement of joint drills, and there has been no other agreement,\u201d South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. \n \n Trump abruptly canceled his top diplomat\u2019s planned trip to North Korea on Friday, publicly acknowledging for the first time that his effort to get Pyongyang to denuclearize had stalled since his summit with the North\u2019s leader. \n \n Trump partly blamed China for the lack of progress with North Korea and suggested that talks with Pyongyang, led so far by Pompeo, could be on hold until after Washington resolved its bitter trade dispute with Beijing. \n \n North Korea\u2019s state media accused the United States of \u201cdouble-dealing\u201d and \u201chatching a criminal plot\u201d on Sunday but did not mention Pompeo\u2019s canceled visit. \n \n U.S. intelligence and defense officials have repeatedly expressed doubts about North Korea\u2019s willingness to give up its nuclear weapons and they had not expected Pompeo\u2019s trip to yield positive results. \n \n Mattis declined to comment on the broader diplomatic efforts, deferring to Pompeo\u2019s State Department. \n \n \u201cWe will work very closely, as I said, with the secretary of state and what he needs done we will certainly do to reinforce his effort. But at this time, there is no discussion about further suspensions,\u201d Mattis said. \n \n The traditional U.S. calendar for other major drills does not pick up again until next spring, officials say, which could give diplomats and military planners time. \n \n The U.S.-South Korean exercise calendar hits a high point every spring with the Foal Eagle and Max Thunder drills, which take months to plan. \n \n U.S. Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis attends the swearing in ceremony for new Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert Wilkie in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, U.S., July 30, 2018. REUTERS/Brian Snyder \n \n One U.S. defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said preliminary planning for next year\u2019s drills was already taking place. Still, the official acknowledged that would not be indicative of whether the drills will go forward. \n \n Max Thunder\u2019s air combat exercises so unnerved North Korea this year that it issued threatening statements that nearly scuttled the June summit between Trump and Kim. \n \n Foal Eagle is designed to simulate war scenarios and involves ground, air, naval and special operations forces. ||||| There are no future plans to halt joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises in the Korean Peninsula, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said Tuesday. This is a departure from the announcement in June that he had \"indefinitely suspended\" military exercises with South Korea after President Trump said at his summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that the U.S. would stop its \"war games\" with South Korea. \n \n Facing a standstill in diplomatic efforts with the North Koreans, this is the latest indication that the Trump administration is not willing to give concessions to Kim without tangible steps on denuclearization. \n \n \"We have no plans at this time to suspend any more exercises,\" Mattis told reporters Tuesday. \n \n As a result of the president's decision, the U.S.-South Korea August exercise, Freedom Guardian, did not take place. On Wednesday Mattis put out a statement clarifying that the US military posture had not changed since the Singapore summit. But what appears to have changed is the appetite from the US to massage relations with North Korea \u2013 sometimes using military tools \u2013 to draw them into negotiations. Mr. Trump himself indicated in June that the stoppage was an overture from the U.S. to keep the North Koreans at the negotiating table as the two sides worked together productively. \n \n \"We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see the future negotiation is not going along like it should,\" Trump said in June, at the Singapore summit. \"But we'll be saving a tremendous amount of money. Plus, I think it's very provocative.\" \n \n Mattis explained that the exercise had been halted in good faith, to grease the wheels for U.S.-North Korea negotiations. He reiterated that sentiment on Tuesday and left open the possibility that future exercises could be halted if it would enable negotiations. \n \n \"I do not have a crystal ball right, now. Let's see how the negotiations go,\" Mattis said. \"Let's let the diplomats go forward. We all know the gravity of the issue they are dealing with, and we will deal with supporting the diplomats as I have said repeatedly.\" \n \n The United States has about 28,500 troops in South Korea. Mattis avoided characterizing future U.S.-South Korean exercises as provocative or not. \n \n The resumption of regular U.S.-South Korea military exercises may be one of a few signs that the Trump administration is growing impatient about having made the concession while North Korea wins itself time and space. \n \n On the same day as Mattis' announcement, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said that \"it's possible\" that North Korea is rethinking its promise to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. \n \n \"Are [the North Koreans] wishing or maybe changing their minds on denuclearization? It's possible,\" Haley said at an event at the Foundation for Defending Democracy, adding, \"but we're not changing our minds on the sanctions. We're not changing our mind on the denuclearization.\" \n \n She also said, however, that the good news is that there has been no missile testing in months and there is a dialogue between the world and North Korea. \n \n Last week, Mr. Trump declared that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would be cancelling his trip to North Korea. The visit, which would have been Pompeo's fourth time travelling to North Korea this year, had only just been announced a day before it was cancelled. The State Department said that there had been progress in the U.S.-North Korea talks broadly because there were ongoing discussions. But Mr. Trump insisted in a tweet that there had not been \"sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\" \n \n Earlier in June, after meeting with top North Korean negotiator Kim Yong Chol, Mr. Trump said that the U.S. was holding off on \"hundreds\" of sanctions while talks were going \"nicely.\" \n \n \"We have very significant sanctions on right now but we have hundreds that are ready to go. But i said I'm not going to put -- why would I do that when we're talking so nicely?\" Trump said. \n \n In August the U.S. rolled out three rounds of sanctions targeting North Korea. The administration says that additional sanctions are likely, as the administration shifts back towards a harsher North Korea stance. \n \n Plans to continue U.S.-South Korean games, implement additional sanctions, and interrupt talks all come as the U.S. has yet to cite any progress from North Korea on efforts to denuclearize. \n \n Even progress in other realms, like efforts to build trust between the two parties, has been slow. North Korea did return remains said to be of American prisoners of the Korean War. Department of Defense officials, however, said it could take years to verify that the bodies are actually Americans. They also described the remains as being in moderate-to-poor condition. \n \n Eleanor Watson contributed to this report.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The war games may be back on. Just two months after President Trump announced he had \"indefinitely suspended\" the \"very provocative\" military drills by the US and South Korea in a move meant to soothe North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Tuesday there are \"no plans at this time to suspend any more exercises,\" per BuzzFeed. Reuters reports the comments come in the midst of a \"breakdown in diplomacy\" with North Korea over denuclearization, though Mattis denied any act of bad faith on North Korea's part. Referring to the decision \"to suspend several of the largest exercises as a good-faith measure coming out of the Singapore summit,\" Mattis said \"we did what we did at the time for that purpose.\" He added there's been no decision on the next large-scale military exercise, previously set for next spring. UN Ambassador Nikki Haley was more pointed in her remarks on North Korea Tuesday. \"Are [the North Koreans] wishing or maybe changing their minds on denuclearization? It's possible \u2026 but we're not changing our minds,\" she said, per CBS News.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 \"We have no plans at this time to suspend any more exercises,\" BuzzFeed quotes Defense Secretary Jim Mattis as saying Tuesday. Mattis says the US suspended large-scale military exercises with South Korea after the June 12 summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un \"as a good-faith measure coming out of the summit,\" Reuters reports. Mattis wouldn't say whether the next military exercise with South Korea, codenamed Foal Eagle, was being rescheduled. \"We are going to see how the negotiations go, and then we'll calculate the future, how we go forward,\" BuzzFeed quotes Mattis as saying. Mattis says the US military is only playing a \"supporting role\" in negotiations with North Korea. \"You're asking for a straightforward answer on a complex subject,\" Reuters quotes Mattis as saying. \"The bottom line is, there was progress made. The whole world saw that progress when the two leaders sat down. We also knew very clearly this was going to be a long and challenging effort to negotiate this away.\"",

    "document": "More than 50 women have made allegations against Harvey Weinstein and the number continues to grow each day. Among the Hollywood mogul\u2019s accusers are household names who were still looking to establish themselves when the alleged offences took place. Below are some of the allegations made public so far. \n \n What Harvey Weinstein tells us about the liberal world | Thomas Frank Read more \n \n The Italian actor Asia Argento alleges that Weinstein raped her when she was 21. She told the New Yorker she had been invited to what she thought was a party in his Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc room near Cannes, but found herself alone with him. He changed into a bathrobe and asked her to give him a massage. She said she had reluctantly agreed, but that he pulled her skirt up and forcibly performed oral sex on her. She said she felt guilty about what she described as a \u201chorrible trauma\u201d and for not fighting him off. She later went on to have consensual sexual relations with him, which she described to the magazine as one-sided and onanistic, because she believed he would ruin her career if she didn\u2019t comply. \u201cAfter the rape, he won,\u201d she said. \n \n The British actor Lysette Anthony says she was raped by Weinstein in her London home in the late 1980s. Anthony, who currently appears in the Channel 4 soap Hollyoaks, has given an interview to the Sunday Times describing an attack that left her feeling \u201cdisgusted and embarrassed\u201d. She first met the producer in 1982 after being cast in the film Krull. It was a number of years later, Anthony alleges, that Weinstein rang her doorbell. \u201cHe pushed me inside and rammed me up against the coat rack in my tiny hall and started fumbling at my gown. He was trying to kiss me and shove inside me. It was disgusting.\u201d Unable to push him away, she continues. \u201cFinally I gave up. At least I was able to stop him kissing me.\u201d Anthony has reported the rape allegation to the police who are investigating. \n \n Lucia Evans, then Stoller, was an aspiring actor when Weinstein approached her at the Cipriani Upstairs club in New York in 2004, she told the New Yorker. He arranged a meeting at the Miramax office, where she found herself alone with him. \u201cHe forced me to perform oral sex on him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a big guy, he overpowered me.\u201d She told the magazine she blamed herself for not fighting harder and that she was still haunted by it. \n \n \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Harvey Weinstein leaves the Manhattan criminal court on 25 May 2018 in New York.

She said he grabbed her hand and pulled it towards his penis which was \u201cvisible and erect \u2026 My heart was really racing. I was in a fight-or-flight mode\u201d.

Please,\u201d he says. \u201cYou are used to that?\u201d Gutierrez asks. \u201cYes,\u201d Weinstein replies, later adding: \u201cI won\u2019t do it again\u201d.

She alleges he took his clothes off and asked for a massage, forcing her to run to the bathroom to escape. \u201cHarvey chased me, dick, balls and all, and banged on the door with his fists, pleading with me to come out\u201d.

Instead, he had her sent up to his room where he appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or if she could watch him shower, she told the NYT. She said her thoughts were: \u201cHow do I get out of this room as fast as possible without alienating Harvey Weinstein.\u201d \n \n Emma de Caunes, a French actor, met Weinstein at a Cannes party in 2010. She told The New Yorker he had invited her to a lunch meeting at the Ritz in Paris.

While I am sickened and angered over the disturbing accusations of Weinstein's sexual predation and abuse of power, I'm happy - ecstatic even - that it has opened up a dialogue around the continued sexual harassment, objectification and degradation of women. To the women who have suffered any form of abuse of power, I stand beside you. To the women who have come forward against a system that is designed to keep you silent, I stand in awe of you and appreciate you and your fortitude. It is not easy to disclose such experiences, especially in the public eye. Your strength will inspire others. Thank you, thank you, thank you, for fighting this battle so hopefully my daughter won't have to. \n \n I've been an actor for a long time. So long, that when I started, we were called 'actresses' - a feminized, watered down name for the same profession our male colleagues have dominated. Somewhere in the early 2000's it became politically incorrect to call us actresses, and with good reason. After all, there's no feminized moniker for a director or producer or a writer or doctor or a lawyer. So 'actresses' became 'actors'. But sexual harassment and sexism in the industry did not change with the title change. We were still clearly 'actresses' to anyone that saw gender before talent and intelligence. \n \n I can tell you what it meant to be an 'actress' then and what it means to be an 'actor' (with breasts) now. BUT more importantly, I can tell you what it means to be a woman in our society. In any - and every - profession, women are continuously mistreated. This is not an uncommon occurrence. This is a sick culture. Men like Harvey Weinstein are around every corner. Men who undermine women and their strength, ability and intelligence exist everywhere. Statistics say that 1 in 3 women are sexually harassed in the workplace. Really think about that. Really allow that statistic to become a part of you. Also, while you process it, think about the gender inequality women - particularly women of color - face in salary and opportunity. Actually, fuck the statistics, just do better, world. \n \n Even with these strong feelings - not just about Weinstein but about workplace sexism in general - this statement is complicated for me for personal reasons. Harvey has a wife, who I have had the privilege of working with for the last 5 years on Project Runway All Stars. Georgina Chapman is my friend. She is one of the most special humans I have ever met. Harvey and Georgina also have two very young children who my children have known their entire lives. It is because of my love for Georgina, India and Dashiell that I haven't publicly commented on this until now. Please don't confuse my silence for anything other than respect for a dear friend and her beautiful children. \n \n And please know that I fight for women's rights every day. I am constantly part of this conversation even if I don't publicly comment on specific scandals. Sexual harassment and assault in the workplace are not just about Harvey Weinstein. We must change things in general. We must do better for women everywhere.",

On Sunday afternoon, Alyssa Milano tweeted: \"If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet.\" This quickly led to the #MeToo hashtag and a tsunami of posts that simply read \"Me too\" on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as detailed stories from those who felt comfortable sharing more\u2014all messages the Washington Post notes \"were striking in their simplicity, and in the sheer number of them.\" Included among the \"tens of thousands\" the New York Times says reacted to Milano's message were other names from show biz, including Debra Messing, Anna Paquin, and Javier Munoz, from Broadway's Hamilton. \"I don't know if [it] means anything coming from a gay man but it's happened.

    "document": "'You Should Resign': Watch Sen. Elizabeth Warren Grill Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images \n \n Facing off with the CEO whose massive bank appropriated customers' information to create millions of bogus accounts, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., had sharp questions Tuesday for Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf. She said Stumpf made millions of dollars in the \"scam,\" telling him, \"You should resign ... and you should be criminally investigated.\" \n \n As we've reported before, Wells Fargo is paying $185 million in penalties for acts that date to at least to 2011. The firm says it fired some 5,300 employees who were found to have created false accounts as it sought to increase \"cross-selling\" \u2014 building the number of accounts each customer holds. \n \n The exchanges between Warren and Stumpf were among the sharpest, but other senators also pressed the executive about what have become hot topics as public outrage has grown over the case. Here's some of what panel Chairman Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., and others wanted to know: \n \n Whether Stumpf regards the case as one of fraud \n \n Whether the bank will \"claw back\" any of the millions it has paid to former executive Carrie Tolstedt, who is retiring with nearly $125 million \n \n How the bank will help customers whose credit ratings have been hurt by the fake accounts \n \n Responding to those questions, Stumpf said he lacked the appropriate expertise, declaring himself at various times not to be a lawyer, a compensation expert or a credit consultant. \n \n Warren began her questioning by citing Wells Fargo's Vision and Values Statement, particularly its suggestion, \"If you want to find out how strong a company's ethics are, don't listen to what its people say, watch what they do.\" \n \n \"So, let's do that,\" Warren said. She then accused Stumpf of failing to hold himself or any other senior executives accountable for the company's actions. \"It's gutless leadership,\" she said, noting that Stumpf is not resigning, returning any of his earnings or firing any senior executives. \n \n Warren moved on to the subject of cross-selling \u2014 calling it a particular focus of Stumpf's tenure as CEO, citing his goal of eight accounts per customer and saying that cross-selling was \"one of the main reasons that Wells has become the most valuable bank in the world.\" \n \n The senator asked Stumpf, \"Cross-selling is all about pumping up Wells' stock price, isn't it?\" \n \n \"No,\" the executive answered. \"Cross-selling is shorthand for deepening relationships,\" he continued \u2014 before Warren cut him off. \n \n She then produced 12 transcripts of Wells Fargo earnings calls Stumpf participated in from 2012 to 2014 \u2014 \"the three full years in which we know this scam was going on,\" Warren said. \n \n \"In all 12 of these calls, you personally cited Wells Fargo's success at cross-selling retail accounts as one of the main reasons to buy more stock in the company,\" Warren told Stumpf. She went on to quote him from the transcripts, as he touted the company's record growth to more than six accounts per household. \n \n When Warren asked Stumpf \u2014 who made $19.3 million in annual compensation (including a performance bonus of $12.5 million) in 2015, how much his stock holdings at Wells Fargo had gained during the period in question, the executive said that the information was all in the public record. \n \n Warren then produced the information herself, saying that Stumpf held an average of 6.75 million shares in the company in that time frame \u2014 and that the share price had risen by about $30, \"which comes out to more than $200 million in gains, all for you personally, and thanks in part to those cross-sell numbers that you talked about on every one of those calls.\" \n \n Here's what Warren said toward the end of her allotted time to question Stumpf: \n \n \"Here's what really gets me about this, Mr. Stumpf. If one of your tellers took a handful of $20 bills out of the crash drawer, they'd probably be looking at criminal charges for theft. They could end up in prison. \"But you squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they would cheat customers and you could drive up the value of your stock and put hundreds of millions of dollars in your own pocket. \"And when it all blew up, you kept your job, you kept your multi-multimillion-dollar bonuses, and you went on television to blame thousands of $12-an-hour employees who were just trying to meet cross-sell quotas that made you rich. \"This is about accountability. You should resign. You should give back the money that you took while this scam was going on, and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. This just isn't right.\" \n \n Stumpf testified with a conspicuously bandaged right hand \u2014 it was particularly noticeable when he raised it to be sworn in Tuesday morning. A bank representative says he injured himself playing with his grandchildren. \n \n During his allotted time to question Stumpf, Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., voiced skepticism at the idea that the 5,300 Wells Fargo employees who were fired had all acted independently. \n \n \"You state unequivocally that there are no orchestrated effort or scheme, as some have called it, by the company,\" Toomey told Stumpf. \"But when thousands of people conduct the same kind of fraudulent activity, it's a stretch to believe that every one of them independently conjured up this idea of how they would commit this fraud.\" ||||| Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Tuesday called for a criminal investigation into Wells Fargo executives over the cross-selling scandal that has engulfed the bank and told CEO John Stumpf he should resign. \n \n As her colleagues grilled Stumpf, Warren lit into the head of the nation's second-largest bank, saying reform won't come to the industry until executives are sent to jail. \n \n \"This is about accountability,\" she said. \"You should resign, you should give back the money you took while this scam was going on and you should be criminally investigated by both the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\" \n \n \"The only way that Wall Street will change is if executives face jail time when they preside over massive frauds,\" she added. \"Until then it will be business as usual, and at giant banks like Wells Fargo, that seems to mean cheating as many customers, investors and employees as they possibly can.\" \n \n As Warren accused Stumpf of \"gutless leadership,\" Wells Fargo's stock price dipped. By midday. it was at $46.20 a share, up 0.43 percent. \n \n \n \n \n \n Warren's comments came amid testy questioning of Stumpf, who presided over what authorities have labeled as illegal cross-selling to millions of customers who often were enrolled into programs without their knowledge. \n \n She ripped into the culture that created the scandal. \n \n \"If one of your tellers took a handful of 20-dollar bills out of the cash drawer, they'd probably be looking at criminal charges for theft,\" she said. \"They could end up in prison, but you squeezed your employees to the breaking point so they could cheat customers and you could drive up the value of hyour stock and put hundreds of millions of dollars in your pocket.\" \n \n \"It wasn't a scam, and cross-selling is a way of deepening relationships,\" Stumpf said. \n \n Warren, who earned her reputation on Capitol Hill as a crusader for Americans against the financial services industry, is one of the scant few on the Senate banking committee who has not been cut a check by Wells Fargo's political action committee. \n \n \n \n \u2014Jon Marino contributed to this report. \n \n ||||| Donald Trump is expected to announce that he plans to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital on Wednesday. The decision is, in some ways, a compromise. Trump had previously pledged to move the United States embassy to Jerusalem, a decision that would have set off an even greater international firestorm. The administration has insisted that it still plans to move the embassy to Jerusalem, but Trump will sign another six-month waiver, meaning that no change is imminent. \n \n Still, the decision has been met with predictable criticism. Pope Francis called on the United States to respect the status quo in Jerusalem, which both the Israelis and Palestinians claim as their capital. The U.S. has historically insisted that Jerusalem\u2019s status be resolved in peace talks; endorsing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s \u201cundivided\u201d capital will likely poison the well before talks have even begun. (West Jerusalem is predominantly Israeli, while East Jerusalem is largely Palestinian; pushes for a Palestinian state have typically called for East Jerusalem to be the capital of such a state.) Manuel Hassassian, the Palestinian representative to the U.K., told the BBC that recognition of Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital would be the \u201ckiss of death\u201d to the peace process. Violent protests are expected in response. \n \n The decision comes amidst a broader shift in Middle East politics. The New York Times reported on Sunday that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman presented Mahmoud Abbas, the head of the Palestinian Authority, with a peace plan \u201cthat would be more tilted toward the Israelis than any ever embraced by the American government.\u201d Per the Times: \n \n The Palestinians would get a state of their own but only noncontiguous parts of the West Bank and only limited sovereignty over their own territory. The vast majority of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which most of the world considers illegal, would remain. The Palestinians would not be given East Jerusalem as their capital and there would be no right of return for Palestinian refugees and their descendants. \n \n The Saudis have denied the contents of the report. But with both Saudi Arabia and the United States growing closer to Israel, it\u2019s becoming increasingly doubtful that Trump will uphold his previous pledge to be a fair broker in negotiations between the Israelis and Palestinians.",

The review, ordered by Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, included an assessment of whether events in Mr. Alexis\u2019s military career should have raised alerts about his violent potential. \n \n In 2004, three years before enlisting as a Navy reservist, Mr. Alexis brandished a .45-caliber pistol and fired at the tires of a construction worker\u2019s car. In another incident, in September 2010, after he was in uniform, commanders halted efforts to force Mr. Alexis out of the Navy with a less-than-honorable discharge because the police declined to pursue a case and it was not entered into his military file, Navy officials said. \n \n The proposals were an acknowledgment by the Navy that there were events that should have raised red flags about Mr. Alexis\u2019s potential for violence. ||||| WASHINGTON \u2014 Washington Navy Yard shooter Aaron Alexis obtained a secret-level security clearance after a federal personnel report failed to mention that a 2004 arrest involved a firearm, the Navy said Monday. \n \n A senior Navy official told reporters the service learned of the incident's violent nature only after Alexis had shot 12 people to death at the Washington Navy Yard last week and was himself fatally shot by police. \n \n The Office of Personnel Management knew of Alexis' Seattle arrest because of a fingerprint check when he joined the Navy Reserve in 2007 and interviewed him about it, the official said. Alexis had not disclosed the offense on his security questionnaire. \n \n Alexis said that he had an altercation with a man doing construction work near his home and that the men had been \"taking retaliatory action toward each other's parked cars,\" according to the investigative document that the personnel office gave to the Navy. Alexis said the construction worker had put a foreign substance in Alexis' gas tank, and Alexis retaliated by \"deflating the male person's tires,\" according to the report. \n \n That account \"reads very different from the police account of what took place that day,\" the senior official said. The Seattle police report says Alexis shot out the tires and was charged with malicious mischief, the official said. \n \n Monday's disclosure revealed another in a chain of missed opportunities by the Navy and Alexis' civilian employer \u2014 a military contractor \u2014 to come to grips with his violent tendencies and apparent mental illness. Alexis had complained that he was hearing voices and being bombarded by microwaves. Because of his job, which required a security clearance, he had a valid ID card that allowed him to enter the Navy Yard. \n \n \"The summary of the Seattle incident that was provided to [the Navy] makes no reference to firearms, makes no reference to a gunshot ... makes no reference to firing into the air,\" the Navy official said. The Navy provided access to the briefing on condition that the official not be identified. \n \n The personnel office said Seattle police would not provide records on the 2004 incident. The office interviewed Alexis, who did not say that a weapon was involved. The personnel office said it could not force police departments to cooperate. \n \n The Navy cleared Alexis based on all the information it had, the senior official said, and there is no way to know \"how they would have adjudicated knowing the events we know now. In a vacuum looking back, what we do know is that the events suggest very different activity.\" \n \n The construction worker did not press charges and the case was dismissed, the personnel office told the Navy. \n \n Sometimes personnel office investigations include police documents, the Navy official said, but in this case the report sent to the Navy did not. \n \n A recent memo sent to Navy Secretary Ray Mabus from Assistant Navy Secretary Juan M. Garcia included a recommendation that all personnel office investigative reports include \"any available police documents related to the subject being investigated for clearance eligibility.\" The recommendation has been sent to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel. \n \n On his security clearance form, Alexis answered \"no\" to questions about whether he had been charged with or convicted of a felony, and \"no\" to whether he had been arrested by any law enforcement official in the last seven years. The personnel report said Alexis said he did not disclose information about his 2004 arrest because the charge was dismissed and he was told by his attorney that it would be removed from his record. \n \n Alexis was found to be eligible for the security clearance in March 2008 after the Navy reviewed the personnel investigation. The only concern was Alexis' credit history, according to a timeline released by the Navy. His clearance was valid for 10 years. \n \n In September 2008, Alexis was arrested in DeKalb County, Ga., on suspicion of disorderly conduct and jailed for two nights, resulting in an unauthorized absence. The Navy gave Alexis an administrative punishment. \n \n In July 2009, he was punished again for being \"drunk and disorderly,\" according to the timeline. But there was no police involvement, and Alexis successfully appealed the punishment, which was removed from his record. \n \n In September 2010, he was arrested in Fort Worth for discharging a firearm in his home after an altercation with a neighbor. Alexis told police the gun accidentally went off as he was cleaning it. No charges were filed. \n \n After the Fort Worth incident, Alexis' commander began the process \"to administratively separate him from the Navy,\" according to the timeline. But when Alexis was not charged, the matter was dropped. \n \n Alexis left the Navy three months later with an honorable discharge. \n \n becca.clemons@latimes.com",

He was asked about it and claimed all he did was deflate a man's tires. In reality, he shot out the man's tires, according to the police report filed in Seattle.

Other observational studies have linked PPIs to serious adverse health outcomes. However, the authors note that no population-based studies, to their knowledge, have looked at the association between PPI use and the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD). \n \n Morgan E. Grams, M.D., Ph.D., of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, and coauthors quantified the association between PPI use and incident CKD in the general population using data on self-reported PPI use in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study (10,482 participants followed up for a median of nearly 14 years) or an outpatient PPI prescription in the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania (248,751 participants followed up for a median of six years). The results were replicated at Geisinger. \n \n At baseline, PPI users in both groups were more likely to have a higher body mass index and take antihypertensive, aspirin or statin medications. \n \n In the ARIC group, there were 56 incident CKD events among 322 baseline PPI users (14.2 per 1,000-person years) and 1,382 events among 10,160 baseline nonusers (10.7 per 1,000 person-years). PPI use was associated with risk of incident CKD in unadjusted and adjusted analyses. The 10-year estimated absolute risk of CKD among the 322 baseline PPI users was 11.8 percent while the expected risk had they not used PPIs was 8.5 percent, according to the results. \n \n In the replication group at Geisinger, there were 1,921 incident CKD events among 16,900 baseline PPI users (20.1 per 1,000 person-years) and 28,226 events among 231,851 baseline nonusers (18.3 per 1,000 person-years). PPI use was associated with risk of incident CKD in analyses. The 10-year absolute risk of CKD among the 16,900 baseline PPI users was 15.6 percent and the expected risk had they not used PPIs was 13.9 percent, results indicate. \n \n The authors note several study limitations, including that participants who are prescribed PPIs may be at higher risk of CKD for reasons unrelated to their PPI use. \n \n \u201cWe note that our study is observational and does not provide evidence of causality. However, a causal relationship between PPI use and CKD could have a considerable public health effect given the widespread extent of use. More than 15 million Americans used prescription PPIs in 2013, costing more than $10 billion. Study findings suggest that up to 70 percent of these prescriptions are without indication and that 25 percent of long-term PPI users could discontinue therapy without developing symptoms. Indeed, there are already calls for the reduction of unnecessary use of PPIs,\u201d the study concludes. \n \n (JAMA Intern Med.

The drug worked, but Lafayette soon started having other problems, such as muscle weakness and severe leg cramping. \n \n Lafayette discovered she was suffering from a magnesium deficiency, a side effect of the drug. She also learned that PPIs can cause not just deficiencies of nutrients but other side effects, such as an increased risk for infections. \n \n So Lafayette decided to try to stop using her PPI. But whenever she did, her heartburn returned. And the symptoms were much worse. \n \n \"I can't seem to get off the drug, because when I do, I experience severe stomach pain. I can't eat anything without experiencing stomach pain,\" Lafayette says. \"It just feels like you've got a knife in your gut. It's just really painful.\" \n \n Lafayette is not alone. Many people have trouble discontinuing PPIs because the amount of acid in their digestive system surges when they stop taking the drug. \n \n Experiences like Lafayette's, and rising evidence that the drugs may be associated with a variety of increased risks, are making doctors increasingly worried about their wide use. \n \n \"The teaching for many years was that these drugs were quite safe,\" says John Clarke, a gastroenterologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. \"But there is data that's emerging that suggests PPIs may not be as safe as we think they are.\" \n \n An estimated 15 million Americans use PPIs, which are sold by prescription and over the counter under a variety of brand names, including Nexium, Prilosec and Prevacid. \n \n They work by blocking production of stomach acid. And that could be the root of the problem, according to Clarke. Stomach acid helps digest food and also has a \"barrier function against different pathogens which are ingested,\" he says. \n \n So when there's less stomach acid, it leaves people vulnerable to nutritional deficiencies and infections, including food poisoning like salmonella, a serious, sometimes life-threatening digestive system infection called Clostridium difficile, and perhaps pneumonia. \n \n Stomach acid also helps digest food. So if you don't have any of that acid, it can make it hard to get the vitamins, minerals and other nutrients you need from your food \u2014 including nutrients that keep bones strong and prevent fractures. \n \n In addition, one recent study suggested people who take PPIs may be at greater risk of heart disease; another suggested the drugs could increase the risk for chronic kidney disease. \n \n Updated Feb. 15, 11 a.m. ET: The latest concern is that PPIs might increase the risk for dementia. Britta Haenisch and colleagues at the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Bonn studied 73,679 people ages 75 and older. The researchers found regular PPI users had at least a 44 percent increased risk of dementia compared with those not using the drugs. \n \n The researchers caution that the risk could only be considered an \"association,\" until more research could be conducted to produce more conclusive evidence. But the findings indicate \"the avoidance of PPI medication may contribute to the prevention of dementia.\" \n \n How PPIs might increase the risk for dementia is unclear. But other researchers recently reported that, in the brains of mice, PPIs seem to increase levels of a damaging protein that accumulates in the brains of dementia patients, known as beta-amyloid. \n \n In an editorial accompanying the study in the journal JAMA Neurology, Lewis Kuller of the University of Pittsburgh wrote that the findings \"provided an important and interesting challenge to evaluate the possible association,\" which is a \"very important issue given\" how commonly the drugs are used by the elderly, who are already at increased risk for dementia. \n \n Our original post continues: As this evidence has emerged, Clarke says, \"I think it's imperative that people who take these drugs really make sure that they are looking at the risks versus benefit and people don't use these drugs lightly.\" \n \n Many people take PPIs when they don't really need them, Clarke says. They could get rid of their heartburn by making lifestyle changes, such as losing weight and cutting back on alcohol, caffeine and spicy and fatty foods. And many people stay on them a lot longer than they need them, he says. PPIs are usually supposed to be taken for two to eight weeks, although doctors may recommend more. \n \n The companies that make PPIs say they're safe for most people if they use them the way they're supposed to. And doctors say many people really need to take a PPI for severe heartburn. \n \n \"Proton pump inhibitors do have some very positive benefits to patients,\" says Kenneth DeVault, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic who is president of the American College of Gastroenterology. \"They relieve symptoms better than any other medication that has ever been developed.\" \n \n The most important \"positive effect of proton pump inhibitors is restoration of a quality of life,\" DeVault says. \"This is probably the big one.\" \n \n PPIs may also reduce the risk for esophageal cancer for some people, he says. \n \n DeVault says if someone really needs a PPI, they should take one. But they should try everything else first, keep an eye out for any side effects, and talk to their doctor about how long they should stay on it. ||||| A key event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) species in the brain, derived from the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretases. Based on a systems biology study to repurpose drugs for AD, we explore the effect of lansoprazole, and other proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), on A\u03b2 production in AD cellular and animal models. We found that lansoprazole enhances A\u03b237, A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 production and lowers A\u03b238 levels on amyloid cell models. Interestingly, acute lansoprazole treatment in wild type and AD transgenic mice promoted higher A\u03b240 levels in brain, indicating that lansoprazole may also exacerbate A\u03b2 production in vivo. Overall, our data presents for the first time that PPIs can affect amyloid metabolism, both in vitro and in vivo. \n \n Competing interests: Albert Pujol and Mireia Coma are employed by Anaxomics Biotech.

We assess the in vivo relevance of our findings in wild-type (wt) and AD triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice and we ultimately speculate about the potential mechanisms underlying the observed alterations. \n \n Lansoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) drug widely used in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease and other conditions where inhibition of gastric secretion may be beneficial [26] , [27] . PPIs are generally well tolerated, and adverse effects are relatively infrequent [28] , [29] . Yet, chronic administration of PPIs is becoming increasingly common, and there is a growing concern about potential unexplored adverse effects from such long-term therapy [30] . \n \n Despite all the efforts put on AD research over the past years, there are no effective treatments to prevent, halt or cure the disease. Indeed, there are only four FDA-approved drugs for AD treatment, although they mainly provide a symptomatic improvement and are unable to stop the disease progression [22] . This prompted us to use the therapeutic performance mapping system (TPMS) [23] to explore potential novel indications of marketed drugs to modify the biology of AD. In brief, the TPMS is a top-down systems biology approach with potential applications in drug repositioning [24] . Starting from the clinical effects produced by different therapeutic compounds (both, positive and negative), we first split them into causative physiological motifs and identified the responsible molecular effectors, which were then mapped onto the disease-related cell network. We afterwards established different relationships between drug targets and effector proteins in the network that are used for training a classifier, with capacity for predicting and scoring novel potential indications on AD of totally unrelated drugs. The complete results of this study will be published elsewhere [25] . Interestingly, the TPMS analysis suggested that lansoprazole could act as a strong potential modulator of the processes involved in amyloid-\u03b2 pathology. \n \n More recently, an alternative hypothesis has been growing and gaining support, based on the idea that the toxic component is within the soluble fraction. There is data showing that soluble forms of A\u03b2 correlate more closely with dementia severity than fibrillar A\u03b2 [9] , [10] , [11] , [12] and that A\u03b2 oligomers alter dendritic spine density and affect hippocampal synaptic plasticity in vivo [13] , [14] , [15] , [16] , [17] . Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that brain oligomeric A\u03b2, but not total amyloid plaque burden, correlates with neuronal loss and astrocyte inflammatory response in APP/Tau transgenic mouse model [18] . In this context, several studies show the presence of A\u03b2 oligomers in CSF of AD patients, while not in healthy individuals, and also the direct correlation of oligomers with cognitive impairment [19] , [20] , [21] . \n \n Several studies support the hypothesis that classic fibrillar amyloid plaques are deleterious to the brain, showing that the subpopulation of dense-core A\u03b2 plaques in particular, the so-called neuritic plaques, are intimately associated with local dendritic spine loss, changes in neurites, and gliosis in AD and mouse models [5] , [6] . However, the total number of amyloid plaques do not correlate well with the severity of illness [7] or with loss of neurons [8] , arguing against a direct causal effect of plaques on cognition or neuronal cell death in AD. \n \n Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder worldwide. Many molecular lesions have been detected in AD, but one of the major pathological hallmarks is the extracellular deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides in the brain [1] , that results in oxidative and inflammatory damage, which in turn leads to energy failure and synaptic dysfunction [2] . Formation of A\u03b2 species is caused by the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two proteases, \u03b2-secretase, also called \u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and \u03b3-secretase. A\u03b240 is the major secreted form while A\u03b242 has been suggested to be the main pathological species in AD pathogenesis [3] , although other truncated A\u03b2 peptides might also contribute substantially to toxicity and amyloidogenesis [4] . \n \n We determined lysate protein concentration using the Bio-Rad D C protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). We loaded 20\u201340 \u00b5g of each cell lysate and electrophoresed in 10% Tris-glycine gels for Western blot analysis. For A\u03b2 species detection, supernatants we run in 11% urea gels. For the immunoblotting we incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit polyclonal anti-C-terminal APP (Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit polyclonal anti-BACE (catalytic domain, Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-sAPP\u03b2 (IBL), 6E10 (against A\u03b2 1\u201316, Covance) or mouse monoclonal anti-actin (Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies. Afterwards, we incubated with either an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody plus enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Millipore), or with an infrared fluorescent-labelled secondary antibody (IRDye, Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA) for 1 h at room temperature. \n \n We thawed 3xTg-AD mouse brains on ice in 3\u00d7 (w/v) 2% SDS with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete\u00ae EDTA-free, Roche) and then we homogenized them. Next, we centrifuged homogenates at 100.000 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Finally, we collected the supernatants and we stored samples at \u221280\u00b0C as SDS-soluble A\u03b2 fractions. \n \n We thawed non-transgenic mouse brains on ice in 3\u00d7 (w/v) 0.2% of diethylamine (DEA) and 50 mM of NaCl buffer with a protease inhibitor cocktail (Complete\u00ae EDTA-free, Roche), and then we homogenized them. We subsequently centrifuged homogenates at 100.000 g for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Finally, we collected the supernatants, and neutralized them by addition of 1\u223610 volume of 0.5 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8. We stored samples at \u221280\u00b0C as DEA-soluble A\u03b2 fractions. \n \n We treated both female 3xTg-AD mice (Charles River) and non-transgenic mice (B6129SF1/J) at 7 month of age for 5 consecutive days with an intraperitoneal injection of lansoprazole. We diluted and administered lansoprazole in 10% DMSO and 18% of encapsin (2-hydroxipropil beta-cyclodextrine), at 20 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg, respectively. At the end point, we sacrificed mice 5 h after the last treatment and we froze each hemisphere in liquid nitrogen and stored them at \u221280\u00b0C. \n \n All animals were housed in an animal facility that is fully compliant with the European policy on the use of Laboratory Animals. Experimental protocols were approved by the Parc Cient\u00edfic of Barcelona Committee and meet the European and Spanish guidelines of animal experimentation. \n \n We used W0-2antibody and Protein-G Sepharose beads to immunoprecipitate human A\u03b2 from conditioned media. We washed Sepharose beads twice in PBS and twice in 100 mM ammonium acetate. We then eluted A\u03b2 twice with 300 \u00b5l of 50% acetic acid and vacuum-dried. Finally, we resuspended the samples in 10 \u00b5l of 33% acetonitrile containing 0.1% tri-fluoric acetic acid and ultrasonicated. Afterwards we analyzed A\u03b2 species by MALDI-MS on sinapinic acid matrix with an UltraflexII TOF/TOF (BrukerDaltonics). \n \n We quantified human A\u03b242 and A\u03b240 levels by human \u03b2-amyloid (1\u201342) and (1\u201340) ELISA kits (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), respectively. We loaded 100 \u00b5L of conditioned media on every assay. For 3xTg-AD mouse brain extracts we previously diluted them 1/40 in standard buffer and then we loaded following manufacturer\u2019s protocol. We measured rodent A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels with ELISA kits (IBL International) according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol. \n \n For A\u03b2 production analysis, we seeded PS70 cells in 12-well plates at a density of 150,000 cells per well and we subsequently treated for 24 h with lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole or esomeprazole (Sigma-Aldrich) at different concentrations. We used the \u03b3\u2013secretase inhibitor DAPT (N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester, Sigma-Aldrich) at 2 \u00b5M as a positive control. Lastly, we collected and stored cell culture supernatants at \u221280\u00b0C until further use. \n \n Results and Discussion \n \n Lansoprazole and Other PPIs Increase A\u03b2 Levels in AD-like Cellular Models To investigate the potential effect of lansoprazole on A\u03b2 production, we treated PS70 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing both wild-type human APP and presenilin 1 (PS1) with increasing concentrations of lansoprazole for 24 h. We first used the MTT reduction assay as a proxy to determine whether the tested concentrations caused cell toxicity, which was not the case below 50 \u00b5M (data not shown), in agreement with previous studies [32]. We subsequently measured the A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels in conditioned media of cultures by specific ELISA immunoassays. We observed that A\u03b240 levels in the conditioned media increased after treatments above 10 \u00b5M (Figure 1A), up to 2-fold increase in the amount of A\u03b240 with respect to the vehicle-treated cultured cells. Furthermore, we observed a dose-dependent increase in A\u03b242 between 5 \u00b5M and 50 \u00b5M (Figure 1A), with more than 200% A\u03b242 increase at 25 \u00b5M and over 300% when treated with 50 \u00b5M. As expected, cells treated with the \u03b3\u2013secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) showed negligible levels of A\u03b2. These results indicate that lansoprazole treatment increase A\u03b2 production at commonly used concentrations [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], which in turn are comparable to other A\u03b2 inducers such as the calcium ionophore A23187, which increases the production of A\u03b2 approximately 3-fold [37], or caffeine (at millimolar concentrations), that increases A\u03b2 levels until 4-fold [38]. In addition, we have observed an A\u03b242 increase of over 250% compared to vehicle in cell cultures treated at 50 \u00b5M lansoprazole, while fenofibrate, a potent A\u03b242 raising A\u03b238 lowering compound, generates an increase of 125% at the same concentration [39]. Overall, these findings provide further evidence about the accuracy of the TPMS to predict pharmacological alterations in A\u03b2 metabolism.

Lansoprazole and similar PPIs increase A\u03b2 levels at 5 \u00b5M\u201350 \u00b5M range in AD-like cells. A, Treatment of PS70 cells with lansoprazole at different concentrations (250 nM\u201350 \u00b5M) for 24 h increased A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels, as measured by ELISA immunoassays (n = 6\u00b1 SD) p<0.05 (+), p<0.01 (*). B, Similar treatment with omeprazole, pantoprazole and esomeprazole at different concentrations (5 \u00b5M\u201350 \u00b5M) also increased A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 levels (n = 4\u00b1 SD) p<0.05 (+), p<0.01 (*). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058837.g001 To check whether these results could also be extrapolated to other PPIs, we examined the effect of compounds of the same drug class on A\u03b2 production. Omeprazole is one of the most widely prescribed drugs worldwide, which is administered as a racemic mixture of its two enantiomers, S-omeprazole (esomeprazole) and R-omeprazole. Similarly, pantoprazole is also broadly used because of its relatively long duration of action compared with other PPIs, and its lower propensity to become activated in slightly acidic body compartments [40]. Since the chemical structures and pharmacological targets of the four PPIs are very similar, our TPMS computational analyses also predicted an effect of these compounds on the A\u03b2 metabolism. Thus, we decided to investigate the effect of omeprazole, pantoprazole and esomeprazole within 5 \u00b5M and 50 \u00b5M range, based on our previous results. Although the increase in A\u03b240 was non-homogeneous for the 3 drugs, they did show a dose-dependent increase in A\u03b242 levels (Fig. 1B), achieving up to 175% increase. Hence, these results suggest that the modulation of A\u03b2 production is a shared feature among the PPI drug class. \n \n Lansoprazole Might Modulate the \u03b3-secretase Complex To gain a deeper insight in the relative formation of A\u03b2 species induced by lansoprazole, we conducted an A\u03b2-immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry analysis of high dose lansoprazole-conditioned media. Different A\u03b2 species are generated because \u03b3\u2013secretase has multiple APP cleavage sites. The main produced species is A\u03b240 and, to a lower extent, A\u03b238 and A\u03b242. Intriguingly, small molecule drugs called \u03b3\u2013secretase modulators (GSM) are able to shift the \u03b3\u2013secretase cleavage site, being classified as straight GSMs when they lower A\u03b242 and rise A\u03b238 [41], or as inverse GSMs (iGSM) when they do the opposite [39], [42], [43]. Interestingly, our MALDI-MS analysis revealed a considerably altered A\u03b2 peptide pattern in cells treated with lansoprazole at 50 \u00b5M. The relative levels of A\u03b242 increased whereas the relative levels of A\u03b238 decreased (Figure 2A). Intriguingly, there was also an increase in A\u03b237. As expected, the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor DAPT completely abrogated A\u03b2 production, showing no A\u03b2 peaks. We further confirmed the A\u03b242 increase and A\u03b238 decrease by Western blot (Figure 2B). Therefore, attending to the results obtained with lansoprazole in the A\u03b2 species production shift, one possible explanation would be that lansoprazole might act as an inverse GSM. PPT PowerPoint slide \n \n PowerPoint slide PNG larger image \n \n larger image TIFF original image Download: Figure 2. Lansoprazole changes the production levels of several A\u03b2 species. A, MALDI-MS analysis of A\u03b2-immunoprecipitated species from conditioned PS70 supernatants. Cells treated with lansoprazole at 50 \u00b5M for 24 h showed a significant increase on A\u03b242 compared to vehicle spectrum. DAPT treated cells were used as a negative control, showing none A\u03b2 species as expected. B, Western blot analysis of the different A\u03b2 species present in treated PS70 supernatants. A decrease on A\u03b238 and increase on A\u03b242 was detected in conditioned media of treated cells with lansoprazole at 50 \u00b5M for 24 h. Short and long exposures are shown for better visualization. C, A\u03b240/42 levels in conditioned media from treated PS70 cells were measured by ELISA immunoassays (n = 3\u00b1 SD) p<0.01 (*). Cells treated with both lansoprazole at 50 \u00b5M and R-flurbiprofen at 200 \u00b5M for 24 h displayed reduced A\u03b242 levels when compared to lansoprazole-only treated cells, indicating the lansoprazole is capable to counteract the R-flurbiprofen A\u03b242 lowering effect. D, Western blot analysis of APP and BACE1 protein levels in total lysates, showing no differences between treated and non-treated cells. A representative experiment is shown (n = 3 independent experiments). E, Western blot analysis of sAPP\u03b2 and sAPP\u03b1 protein levels in conditioned media. The immunoblot shows an increase in sAPP\u03b2 in conditioned media from cells treated with lansoprazole. A representative experiment is shown (n = 3 independent experiments). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058837.g002 To further investigate this hypothesis, we wanted to test if lansoprazole was able to counterbalancing the A\u03b242-lowering capability of R-flurbiprofen, a well characterized non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that acts as straight GSM [44], [45]. NSAIDs are widespread used due to the prevalence of diseases in the aging population and to their crucial role as effective antipyretic analgesics in a wide spectrum of conditions and diseases ranging from a common cold to rheumatoid arthritis [46]. However, they are known to disrupt the mucosal resistance to gastric acid through several mechanisms including suppression of prostaglandin production and are thus associated with adverse events such as gastric or duodenal ulcers. For that reason, the co-administration with PPIs is strongly recommended in certain circumstances [47], [48]. Notably, albeit we can find straight and inverse GSM modulators within NSAIDs, the former have been considered as very interesting therapeutic agents in AD, since they can lower A\u03b242 without perturbing the cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, the principal pharmacological target of NSAIDs [41], [49]. As expected, cells treated with R-flurbiprofen showed decreased A\u03b242 levels while cells treated with lansoprazole increased A\u03b242 levels (Figure 2C). Interestingly, when the two drugs were combined, lansoprazole blocked the A\u03b242 decrease induced by R-flurbiprofen. Therefore, these results suggest that concomitant administration of PPIs with NSAIDs may neutralize the A\u03b242 lowering effect provided by NSAIDs, at least in cell culture. Taken together, these findings suggest that lansoprazole increase A\u03b242 production similarly to other described iGSMs. Nevertheless, alternative mechanisms related to APP dimerization processes could also play a role in the observed changes of A\u03b242 levels [50]. \n \n Lansoprazole Might Increase BACE1 and Meprin \u03b2 Protease Activities The putative iGSM activity of lansoprazole could explain the increase of A\u03b242 coupled to a decrease of A\u03b238, but it cannot account for the rise of A\u03b240. Hence, we wanted to investigate other possible effects of lansoprazole on A\u03b2 production. The APP can be processed by two different pathways: the non-amyloidogenic pathway, involving \u03b1-secretase and \u03b3-secretase activities, and the amyloidogenic pathway, requiring BACE1 and \u03b3-secretase [2]. If the first cleavage is performed by \u03b1-secretase, soluble APP\u03b1 (sAPP\u03b1) and APP C83 C-terminal fragments are generated, and the consecutive cleavage by \u03b3-secretase produces the p3 peptides, which are non-amylodogenic. On other hand, when APP is first cleaved by BACE1, soluble APP\u03b2 (sAPP\u03b2) and APP C99 fragments are otherwise generated, and \u03b3-secretase cleavage ultimately generates A\u03b2 peptides and the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain (AICD) fragments. To explore how lansoprazole was able to increase A\u03b237 and A\u03b240 levels, we first tested whether it increased APP or BACE1 protein levels, since higher amounts of A\u03b2 substrate or processing enzyme would certainly explain the increase in A\u03b2 production [1], [51]. However, we did not observe any significant change in the protein expression levels of either protein (Figure 2D). We then interrogated if lansoprazole could enhance BACE1 activity instead, and measured the generation of sAPP\u03b2, a BACE1 cleavage product. Interestingly, we observed that lansoprazole promoted sAPP\u03b2 production, suggesting an increase of BACE1 activity. In contrast, sAPP\u03b1 remained unaffected by lansoprazole treatment (Figure 2E). In addition, the mass spectra also revealed a slight increase of the A\u03b22-37, A\u03b22-40 and A\u03b22-42 species (Fig. 2A), which could be accounted for the meprin \u03b2 metalloprotease, recently identified as an APP cleaving enzyme at the p2 position [52]. Variations in the media pH induced by lansoprazole could thus boost this protease activity, generating A\u03b22-x peptides. Overall, these findings suggest that lansoprazole may not only modulate \u03b3-secretase, but also seems to increase BACE1 activity, boosting the A\u03b2 species production that would be eventually reflected in A\u03b240 and A\u03b237 increased levels. Nevertheless, since the PPIs are known to be irreversible inhibitors of H+/K+ ATPase, lansoprazole-induced variations in the media pH may also affect the activity of other proteases, such as meprin \u03b2, and ultimately affecting A\u03b2 production, particularly A\u03b22-x species. \n \n Acute Treatment with Lansoprazole Increases A\u03b2 Levels in Both wt and AD Mouse Models Our results would not go beyond a cellular curiosity if lansoprazole could not cross the blood brain barrier. However, it has been reported that it can indeed cross it and exert its effects in brain tissue [53]. Thus, to determine whether lansoprazole is capable of altering A\u03b2 production in the brain, we conducted short-term intraperitoneal administration in wt and AD triple-transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse models, like in previous studies [39] (Figure 3). 3xTg-AD mice overexpress human tau and APP in a mutant PS1 knock-in background, and present both plaque and tangle pathologies in an age-related manner [54]. Even though, acute treatments do not enable an evaluation of histopathological or cognitive alteration, since changes in A\u03b2 plaque burden or cognitive impairment usually occur after a long and sustained treatment of at least 2\u20133 months. Yet, 8-month age transgenic mice typically contain few A\u03b2 plaques but they have significant amounts of intracellular and soluble A\u03b2 [54], being a suitable age to test changes in soluble A\u03b2. PPT PowerPoint slide \n \n PowerPoint slide PNG larger image \n \n larger image TIFF original image Download: Figure 3. Lansoprazole raises A\u03b240 production in mice. A, Non-transgenic mice were treated 5 consecutive days with 100 kg/mg of lansoprazole (n = 10). Soluble A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 from brain extracts were measured by ELISA (n = 10\u00b1 SD) p<0.05 (+). Lansoprazole increased A\u03b240 levels in non-transgenic mice. B, 3xTg-ADwere treated 5 consecutive days with 100 kg/mg of lansoprazole (n = 6). Soluble A\u03b240 and A\u03b242 from brain extracts were measured by ELISA (n = 6\u00b1 SD) p<0.05 (+), p<0.01 (*). Lansoprazole increased soluble A\u03b240 levels in 3xTg-AD mice in a dose-dependent manner. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058837.g003 We used administration doses of 20 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day. When compared to the equivalent doses in human [55], the administered concentrations are far below the LC50 (5000 mg/Kg) and comparable to the doses prescribed to treat certain pathologies, such as the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, 180 mg/day [56]. We found that, indeed, acute treatment with 100 mg/kg/day intraperitoneally administered lansoprazole increased soluble A\u03b240 levels in healthy, non-transgenic mice (Figure 3A). Levels of soluble A\u03b242 were also slightly increased, although they did not reach statistical significance. In the case of 3xTg-AD mice, short-term treatment with 20 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day of lansoprazole dramatically raised soluble A\u03b240 levels in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3B). Interestingly, A\u03b240 production was higher than in non-transgenic mice, attaining almost to the 250% rise at 100 mg/kg/day. Similarly to the non-transgenic mice, we also observed a moderate increase in soluble A\u03b242 levels, although they were not statistically significant either. In order to contextualize the relevance of the effects shown in mice at doses used in this study, it is worth to mention that a recent patent proposes a daily dose up to 400 mg of lansoprazole to inhibit tumor growth in humans [33]. Using the body surface area (BSA) normalization method [55], the conversion of the 20 mg/Kg and 100 mg/Kg mouse doses into equivalent human doses results in around 100 mg/day and 486 mg/day, respectively. Interestingly, we found an increase of A\u03b2 levels in 3xTg-AD mice treated with 20 mg/Kg/day of lansoprazole, providing evidence of a clear effect at human prescribed equivalent doses. The differences observed in the A\u03b240/A\u03b242 levels between cellular and mouse models could be partially explained by the A\u03b2 quantization, since we only measured extracellular A\u03b2 in cells, while we measured both extracellular and intracellular A\u03b2 species in brain homogenates. Despite these differences, our findings demonstrate that lansoprazole is able to augment A\u03b2 production both in vitro and in vivo models, with an exacerbated effect in AD models. ||||| WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 (UPI) -- The number of potential side effects from the use of proton-pump inhibiting drugs to control heartburn continues to grow, with new research in Germany linking them to the development of dementia. \n \n A new study links the widely used PPIs -- which include Nexium, Prevacid and Prilosec -- to an increased risk for cognitive decline, though researchers caution the study has limitations, and does not show a definite cause. \n \n PPIs have recently been linked to kidney disease, heart disease, and deficiencies of B12 and other vitamins. While patients have reported side effects of the drugs, not taking them often results in stomach pains and worse heartburn as the drug leaves their systems. \n \n \"It does not tell us anything that should change medical practice right now,\" Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association, told CBS News. \"I don't think there's going to be an uprising among doctors telling patients not to take their PPIs. This doesn't rise anywhere near the level of evidence you would need for that.\" \n \n For the study, published in JAMA Neurology, researchers analyzed patient data collected from 2004 to 2011 by the German health insurer Allgemeine Ortskrankenkassen for 73,679 of its customers. \n \n The patients, who were 75 years or older and did not have dementia, on PPI drugs showed a 44 percent increased risk of dementia compared with those who did not use them. Researchers said in the study the data is supported by recent studies with mice that found rodents on PPIs had increased levels of amyloid plaques in their brains, the buildup of which contributed to dementia. \n \n Researchers and doctors note that these studies have not accounted for lifestyle or diet, both of which affect the risk for dementia, or other diseases for which PPIs may increase risk. \n \n \"The teaching for many years was that these drugs were quite safe,\" John Clarke, a gastroenterologist at Johns Hopkins Hospital, told NPR. \"But there is data that's emerging that suggests PPIs may not be as safe as we think they are.\" ||||| Importance Medications that influence the risk of dementia in the elderly can be relevant for dementia prevention. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases but have also been shown to be potentially involved in cognitive decline. \n \n Objective To examine the association between the use of PPIs and the risk of incident dementia in the elderly. \n \n Design, Setting, and Participants We conducted a prospective cohort study using observational data from 2004 to 2011, derived from the largest German statutory health insurer, Allgemeine Ortskrankenkassen (AOK). Data on inpatient and outpatient diagnoses (coded by the German modification of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision) and drug prescriptions (categorized according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System) were available on a quarterly basis. Data analysis was performed from August to November 2015. \n \n Exposures Prescription of omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, or rabeprazole. \n \n Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was a diagnosis of incident dementia coded by the German modification of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision. The association between PPI use and dementia was analyzed using time-dependent Cox regression. The model was adjusted for potential confounding factors, including age, sex, comorbidities, and polypharmacy. \n \n Results A total of 73 679 participants 75 years of age or older and free of dementia at baseline were analyzed. The patients receiving regular PPI medication (n = 2950; mean [SD] age, 83.8 [5.4] years; 77.9% female) had a significantly increased risk of incident dementia compared with the patients not receiving PPI medication (n = 70 729; mean [SD] age, 83.0 [5.6] years; 73.6% female) (hazard ratio, 1.44 [95% CI, 1.36-1.52]; P < .001). \n \n Conclusions and Relevance The avoidance of PPI medication may prevent the development of dementia. This finding is supported by recent pharmacoepidemiological analyses on primary data and is in line with mouse models in which the use of PPIs increased the levels of \u03b2-amyloid in the brains of mice. Randomized, prospective clinical trials are needed to examine this connection in more detail. ||||| A popular class of heartburn medications might raise a senior's risk of dementia, a new study suggests. \n \n Called proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), this group of drugs includes Prilosec, Nexium and Prevacid. They work by lowering the amount of acid produced by the stomach. \n \n But German researchers found that people 75 or older who regularly take the medications had a 44 percent increased risk of dementia, compared with seniors not using the drugs. The study only found an association, however, and not a cause-and-effect link. \n \n \"To evaluate cause-and-effect relationships between long-term PPI use and possible effects on cognition in the elderly, randomized, prospective clinical trials are needed,\" said corresponding author Britta Haenisch, from the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases in Bonn. \n \n In the meantime, \"Clinicians should follow guidelines for PPI prescription, to avoid overprescribing PPIs and inappropriate use,\" Haenisch said. \n \n The report was published Feb. 15 in the journal JAMA Neurology. \n \n The results are surprising enough that at least one leading expert on aging, Dr. Malaz Boustani, plans to share the findings with older patients who are using PPIs. \n \n Boustani said earlier studies have linked another type of antacid, H2 blockers, with an increased risk of dementia. Up to now, he's recommended that patients use PPIs to treat acid reflux and steer clear of H2 blockers like Tagamet, Pepcid and Zantac. \n \n \"I'm going to disclose the finding to my patients and then let them decide whether they will take the risk or not,\" said Boustani, a professor of medicine with the Indiana University Center for Aging Research and a spokesman for the American Federation for Aging Research. \"On Monday I have clinic, and if I have patients taking a PPI or an H2 blocker I will tell them exactly what I'm telling you, and then they can decide.\" \n \n More than 15 million Americans used prescription PPIs in 2013, at a total cost of more than $10 billion, according to a report by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics. Several popular PPIs -- Prilosec, Prevacid and Zegerid -- also are available over-the counter, further boosting their use. \n \n Concern has been increasing that Americans might be overusing PPIs to treat minor cases of heartburn or acid reflux. \n \n As many as 70 percent of PPI prescriptions in the United States have been inappropriately handed out by doctors, and 25 percent of long-term users could stop taking the medication without suffering increased heartburn or acid reflux, according to a study published in January in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. \n \n Overuse of PPIs could have drastic effects on health, that study found. For example, the medications have been linked to a 20 percent to 50 percent higher risk of chronic kidney disease. \n \n And now the German researchers report there also is some evidence that PPI use might affect a person's ability to reason. \n \n PPIs appear to effect levels of amyloid beta and tau, which are proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease, the German authors said. PPI use can also lead to vitamin B12 deficiency, which has been associated with cognitive decline. \n \n To test the possible association between PPIs and dementia, the German researchers collected data from a large German health insurance firm on almost 74,000 seniors aged 75 or older. The data ran from 2004 to 2011, and included diagnoses and drug prescriptions. \n \n About 2,950 patients regularly used PPIs, which for this study was defined as at least one PPI prescription in each quarter of an 18-month interval. \n \n Regular users of PPIs had a 44 percent increased risk of dementia compared with those not receiving PPI medications. \n \n However, the study doesn't make clear whether PPIs are also available over the counter in Germany, as they are in the United States, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. \n \n If over-the-counter PPIs are available, then more people might have been taking them and the dementia risk described in this paper could be overestimated, Swaminath said. \n \n \"However, I think the point here is that for some patients, weaning off PPIs is reasonable and they should make this decision with their doctors,\" he said. \n \n People who want to ease off PPIs can take a number of steps to reduce excess acid or prevent acid reflux, Boustani said. They can eat smaller meals, lay off chocolate and caffeine, and stay upright for a few hours following each meal. \n \n Boustani added that his group has received federal funding to design clinical trials in which people would be weaned off PPIs, to see how it affects their ability to remember and think. \n \n Dr. Gisele Wolf-Klein, director of geriatric education at North Shore-LIJ Health System in New Hyde Park, N.Y., added that even the researchers aren't sure why PPIs would affect the aging brain. \n \n \"We don't know what is causing the brain to deteriorate. Until we know this, there's no reason for people who are taking PPIs to be too concerned about that and stop taking those agents if they are needed,\" Wolf-Klein said. \n \n Another expert agreed. \n \n While the study is intriguing, it's not enough for doctors to warn patients off PPI use, said Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association. \n \n \"It does not tell us anything that should change medical practice right now,\" Fargo said. \"I don't think there's going to be an uprising among doctors telling patients not to take their PPIs. This doesn't rise anywhere near the level of evidence you would need for that.\" \n \n One of the paper's main flaws is that researchers could not control for diet and body weight as risk factors, Fargo said. \n \n \"Both of those things, we know, are risk factors for developing cognitive decline and dementia in later life, and both of those are reasons why a person might need to take a proton pump inhibitor,\" Fargo explained.",

Now a study in JAMA Neurology says those drugs\u2014proton-pump inhibitors like Prilosec, Prevacid, and Nexium\u2014may also boost the chance of dementia, UPI reports. Analyzing a German health insurer's data on nearly 74,000 customers aged 75 and up from 2004 to 2011, researchers found a 44% higher dementia risk among \"PPI\" users. The finding also coincides with research showing that mice on PPIs had higher amyloid plaque levels in their brains, which has been linked to dementia. So what to do, when roughly 15 million Americans use prescription PPIs and other patients take over-the-counter versions? For now, nothing. More clinical trials are needed to analyze the possible PPI-dementia link, senior study author Britta Haenisch tells CBS News. For one thing, the JAMA Neurology study didn't account for lifestyle and diet, which can influence dementia risk. But, she adds, \"clinicians should follow guidelines for PPI prescription, to avoid overprescribing PPIs and inappropriate use.\" Up to 70% of PPI prescriptions may be needless reactions to minor cases of acid reflux or heartburn, per a recent study. Big picture: PPIs are being seen in a whole new light. \"The teaching for many years was that these drugs were quite safe,\" a gastroenterologist tells NPR. \"But there is data that's emerging that suggests PPIs may not be as safe as we think they are.\" (Turns out vegetable oils may cause dementia when heated.)",

    "document": "On late Friday, The Washington Post broke the explosive story that the Central Intelligence Agency concluded that Russians intervened in the U.S. election to help Donald Trump win. This morning, President-elect Donald Trump was up tweeting indignantly\u2014about the Celebrity Apprentice. \n \n Trump hasn\u2019t held a press conference in months and instead uses Twitter to issue statements and go after critics. Media analysts have long noted that Trump will go off on unrelated tweet storms after a major, and potentially damaging, news story breaks about him. For example, after Donald Trump agreed to pay $25 million to settle a Trump University fraud lawsuit, Trump tweeted attacks on the cast of the Broadway show, Hamilton. Distracting people from Trump\u2019s fraud settlement was exactly the point, argued Jack Shafer in a Politico article entitled \u201cStop being Trump\u2019s Twitter fool.\u201d \n \n This morning would seem to be another case in point. Yes, it was big news when Variety disclosed Thursday that Trump would continue to serve as executive producer of NBC\u2019s reality-TV show and collect probably hundreds of thousands of dollars. But that was completely eclipsed by the bombshell report that Russia had an espionage operation to get Donald Trump elected president. Trump has been famously friendly to Russia\u2019s strongman leader Vladimir Putin, calling him a better leader than President Obama, and Russia apparently concluded that Trump would more likely to relax economic sanctions than would Hillary Clinton. \n \n The report of Russia\u2019s meddling also included the revelation that Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell played a key role in keeping the explosive information under wraps during the election. According to The Post, which cited unnamed sources, McConnell voiced doubts about U.S. intelligence and threatened to publicly accuse the Obama administration of partisan politics if the White House challenged the Russians publicly. \n \n After the election, Trump chose McConnell\u2019s wife Elaine Chao to be secretary of transportation. Chao served as secretary of labor in George W. Bush administration. Her appointment requires approval by Congress; McConnell has rejected calls to recuse himself from the confirmation process. \n \n Even more explosive, the New York Times reported that intelligence agencies have \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Russians hacked the Republican National Committee but \u201cconspicuously released no documents\u201d related to Republicans. Which raises the disturbing question: Is Russia holding onto these materials to use as leverage, perhaps over the Trump administration? \n \n Julian Assange of Wikileaks, which published the hacked Clinton emails, has denied that it received the materials from the Russian government. Russia also has denied the allegations. \n \n The latest news, however, immediately set off a firestorm. Evan McMullin, a former CIA agent who was a Republican presidential candidate, tweeted: \n \n Republican leaders knew Russia was undermining our democracy during the election and they chose to ignore it. \u2014 Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) December 10, 2016 \n \n Donald Trump\u2019s team issued a brief, stunning statement Friday\u2014attacking the CIA\u2019s credibility. \u201cThese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\u201d the transition team said in an unsigned statement. \u201cThe election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It\u2019s now time to move on and \u2018Make America Great Again.'\u201d (Note: Trump\u2019s electoral victory was no landslide; he actually won by one of the slimmest margins in U.S. history.) \n \n And here\u2019s what Trump said on Twitter: \n \n Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are ridiculous & untrue \u2013 FAKE NEWS! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 10, 2016 \n \n I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 10, 2016 \n \n (I won\u2019t be Trump\u2019s Twitter fool by explaining The Apprentice contretemps. You can read about it here and here. ) \n \n Trump has said he\u2019ll have a press conference on December 15th. It would be his first since July 27th. At the last conference, he told reporters that he hoped Russian intelligence agencies had hacked Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and would publish whatever they found. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cI think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\u201d ||||| Make no mistake, yesterday\u2019s Washington Post revelation that the CIA has concluded that Russia was actively trying to elect Donald Trump as opposed to just \u201cmeddling with\u201d the election, is a nuclear bombshell. And if the Post piece is Hiroshima, then today\u2019s New York Times story, which adds the detail that Russian actors also hacked email accounts at the Republican National Committee but did not release those publicly as they did Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign emails, is Nagasaki. \n \n Hyperbole? Think again. A foreign government may have determined the outcome of a presidential election. And not Canada or Costa Rica, but Russia: the United States\u2019 chief historic adversary and an oligarchy ruled by a tyrant who has systematically taken away rights. Bombshells don\u2019t come much bigger. \n \n Oh, wait; yes they do. On top of all the above, leaders of one of our two political parties\u2014I\u2019ll let you hazard a guess as to which one\u2014argued against letting the American public know about all this before the election, reportedly saying it would be too partisan. That\u2019s not hardball politics. That\u2019s a hair\u2019s breath away from treason. \n \n So yes, this is major. But let\u2019s catch our breath. We don\u2019t know yet for a fact that these allegations are true. Both stories came from anonymous intelligence community sources, and in all such cases, the sources need to be considered. So the Obama administration and the CIA should put this information out there publicly. \n \n And if the evidence is persuasive, what next? \n \n It\u2019s hard to say. It will be easy to prove to all but the most purblind partisans that Russia had the intent of electing Trump. But it will be much more difficult to prove that Russia did in fact elect Trump. That may never be provable. Unless evidence emerges that Russia specifically altered vote counts, Republicans will always be able to say it was something else and turn it back on Hillary. \n \n Good luck getting Republicans to agree on anything here. Mitch McConnell? Please. He\u2019s the one who said, at a hush-hush meeting back in September where administration officials urged that bipartisan group of 12 legislators go public with concerns about Russian interference in the election, that he would not participate and that if Democrats did so, he would tell the American people this was just partisan politics. \n \n Think that through. McConnell, according to the Post story, showed no concern about the truth of the allegations. And bear this nugget in mind: This was not Barack Obama trying to persuade him to join in this bipartisan effort. This was Lisa Monaco, the president\u2019s counterterrorism adviser; and Jeh Johnson, the Secretary of Homeland Security secretary; and FBI Director James Comey . McConnell told Comey, in essence, to go take a jump in the lake. McConnell was interested only in party, not at all in country. That\u2019s not treason, but it sure isn\u2019t patriotism. \n \n This obviously cries out for hearings and an investigation, or a few of them. If we lived in a different universe, we\u2019d ideally have a bipartisan investigation by Congress that was honest and serious and was able to be finished or at least to reach decent conclusions before the Electoral College votes on December 19. \n \n But that will not happen. Republicans will make the Democrats do all the lifting here and then will cry that they\u2019re being partisan and it\u2019s just sour grapes. (Republican Senator John Cornyn tweeted , All this 'news' of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years. Serious, but hardly news.\") But this is a genuine crisis. The guy who got 2.8 million fewer votes to begin with, and won because he took three states by less than 1 percent may have made it over the finish line, limping as he was, with a push from Vladimir Putin. \n \n I know I often say \u201cimagine if Hillary had done this,\u201d but in this case, it\u2019s not a mere hypothetical. Imagine the situation were reversed, and this lurid right-wing dystopic fantasy were playing out before our eyes\u2014remembering, I should note, that Trump earlier in the campaign encouraged Russia to do more hacking of Clinton! What would the Republicans be doing? A few things, I think: \n \n \u2022They\u2019d certainly be calling the election illegitimate and would declare Clinton an illegitimate president. \n \n Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

And with good reason: Trump has displayed intense skepticism of what US intelligence agencies regard as a profound risk to the American electoral system. \n \n So Obama is attempting to box Trump in politically\u2014ordering a definitive report on Russia\u2019s cyber-intrusions before he leaves office in six weeks. \n \n In a new briefing to key members of Congress last week, the CIA advanced its long-held conclusion that Russia conducted cyber-intrusions and disseminated fake news in order to disrupt the presidential election. In its latest assessment, the CIA said the attacks were not intended solely to disrupt the election, but specifically to skew it to Trump\u2019s advantage, according to the Washington Post. The newspaper quotes a US official who was in the congressional briefing as saying \u201cIt is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia\u2019s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected.\u201d \n \n The CIA assessment aligns with the discovery of similar cyber-attacks across Europe, including the hacking of sensitive servers, as well as information warfare. In recent days, intelligence officials in both the UK and Germany have said that Russia\u2019s cyber warfare imperils their respective democracies. On Dec. 10, Nicholas Burns, one of the most respected former diplomats in the US, tweeted that the threat is sweeping. \n \n Trump\u2019s team, however, has brushed off the new reports as the work of a tarnished intelligence community. \u201cThese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It\u2019s now time to move on and \u2018Make America Great Again,\u2019\u201d the statement read. \n \n In an interview with Time magazine, Trump had voiced similar sarcasm about the cyberattacks. \u201cIt could be Russia. And it could be China. And it could be some guy in his home in New Jersey,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe that it could have been Russia and it could have been any one of many other people. Sources or even individuals.\u201d \n \n Hence Obama\u2019s worry. Broadly speaking, Trump is setting an early trend of treating information he doesn\u2019t like as politicization. For instance, his transition team has suggested that the Energy Information Administration, the much-respected data division of the US Department of Energy, is politicizing its data to support Obama\u2019s climate change agenda. And he is accusing the 17 US intelligence agencies\u2014one of the baselines of US foreign policy\u2014of doctoring the hacking analysis to tarnish him and his presidency. The mindset suggests another dimension to Trump\u2019s penchant for operating in an alternate universe of facts. \n \n With that as the backdrop, Obama is racing against the clock to get the facts on Russia out there prior to Trump\u2019s inauguration. \n \n There is bipartisan support in Congress for action against Russia. In separate statements, Republican senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer both called for investigations into the hacking. \u201cI am going to lead the charge to investigate Russia\u2019s role, not only in the elections but throughout the world,\u201d Graham said. \u201cSo I\u2019m going after Russia in every way we can go after Russia. I think they\u2019re one of the most destabilizing influences on the world stage. I think they did interfere with our elections, and I want Putin personally to pay a price.\u201d \n \n In terms of that price, the US has what experts call the most sophisticated offensive cyber capabilities in the world, and it could easily retaliate. The question always has been how, since no one wants to initiate an escalating tit-for-tat cyber war that could easily get out of hand. One of the most powerful US messages, for example, could be taking out a piece of the Russian electric grid; but Russia presumably is armed with similar capability and could do the same thing. In which case, what does the US do next? \n \n Until now, Obama has seemed reluctant to act without bipartisan support in the form of consensus from the Republican-controlled Congress. In September, White House homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco, plus FBI director James Comey, and cabinet secretary of homeland security Jeh Johnson, met with 12 Senate leaders of both parties to brief them on the election hacking. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell responded by casting doubt on the intelligence, and pushed back against any public rebuke of Russia. He said he would view that as not factual, but a partisan message from the Democratic party. \n \n With a Republican in the White House and the war over with Obama, however, McConnell and other Republican congressional leaders could look at the intelligence differently. But Trump, who has publicly expressed admiration for and a desire to get along with Putin, could be a different story. Obama certainly appears to be preparing for the possibility that Trump would ignore any evidence of Russian meddling. ||||| CIA officials told senators it is now \"quite clear\" that electing Donald Trump was Russia's goal. In an interview on Fox News Sunday on Dec. 11, President-elect Trump denied the CIA's assessment. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) \n \n As evidence piles up that Russia actively tried to tilt the presidential election to Donald Trump, the big flash point over a potential U.S. response won't just be between that nation and the United States \u2014 it could also be between the president-elect and the Republican Party. \n \n Some senior congressional Republicans are indicating that they want to investigate Russia's meddling in our election; Trump \u2014 as well as some members of the GOP on Capitol Hill \u2014 has been clear that he wants to give Russia the benefit of the doubt. (After all, it's his victory that risks being called into question.) \n \n It's a no-win situation for the GOP. But what if Russia-distrusting Republicans in Congress could get Trump to take a tougher line with Moscow? It would certainly make their lives a lot easier by allowing them to both hold Russia accountable and avoid a potential intraparty war as soon as Trump takes office. \n \n They do have options to try to steer Trump away from being friendly with Russia \u2014 though pretty much all of them risk some level of confrontation with their president. Of course, there's no guarantee Trump would go along with Congress. But Mieke Eoyang, a national security expert with the center-left think tank Third Way, weighed in on four ways Congress could act, whether the commander in chief is on board or not: \n \n 1. Hold hearings. Lots of hearings. \n \n \n \n Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) (Susan Walsh/Associated Press) \n \n A hearing is Congress's equivalent of a bully pulpit. \n \n And there are some early indications that Republicans, who control both chambers, intend to use it to get tough on Russia \u2014 and Trump. The Washington Post's Karoun Demirjian reported that several Republican senators who run powerful committees \u2014 Sens. John McCain (Ariz.) on the Armed Services Committee, Richard Burr (N.C.) on the Intelligence Committee and Bob Corker (Tenn.) on the Foreign Relations Committee \u2014 are readying hearings on Russia's ability to hack into U.S. political parties and even weapons systems. \n \n These coordinated hearings are likely to have three overarching goals, each of which builds on the other: \n \n 1. Explain to the American public what, exactly, officials think Russia did to try to influence the election and how directly involved its government was in this. \n \n 2. Piece together an ironclad case that Russia took unprecedented steps to meddle in American democracy. \n \n 3. Try to prove to Trump that Russia is the bad guy here, in a way that gives their president no outs to say, as he did this past week, that the election-related hacks could have been done by \u201csome guy in his home in New Jersey.\u201d \n \n Then again, these hearings also risk dividing Republicans in Congress. The Post reported Friday that in September, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) got a secret briefing on all this and threw doubt on intelligence officials' assessment that Russia was meddling in the election to benefit Trump. And he made clear he'd consider any attempt to go public with it before the election to be a partisan attack on his nominee. \n \n Which raises the question of how those who wanted to defend Trump before the election will react to these revelations now that he's about a month shy of being president. \n \n 2. Take it to Russia overseas \n \n \n \n A boy looks at a mural depicting Russian President Vladimir Putin and President-elect Donald Trump in Belgrade, Serbia. (Andrej Cukic/European Pressphoto Agency) \n \n The battleground for this fight is in Syria and Ukraine. (Few things having to do with U.S.-Russian relations are direct.) Shortly after the election, the House passed a bill that would levy sanctions against any nation that tries to help the Syrian government in its effort to regain control in a years-long civil war. (The United States is on the side of the rebels.) \n \n The bill was aimed partly at Russia, which has been providing military aid to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, even as human rights groups have said the Syrian government is slaughtering and even torturing innocent civilians. \n \n Congress also passed a defense policy bill that calls for providing millions of dollars worth of weapons and other lethal aid to the government of Ukraine, another country torn by violence where the United States and Russia have held very different positions. \n \n These bills attempt to draw a line in the sand for Russia and its actions overseas, but they also draw a line in the sand for Trump: Sign them or risk looking weak on Syria/Russia/the Islamic State. \n \n Trump has said it would be \u201cwonderful\u201d if the United States and Russia could work together in Syria. But it's much easier to say that during a campaign than it is to veto a bill that your own party put on your desk and says is crucial to U.S. national security interests. \n \n (There's also always the possibility of other sanctions aimed at Russia that have more to do with its actions in the United States than its Syria moves \u2014 though no sign of anything of that sort is in the works.) \n \n 3. Start a war of words with Trump \n \n A bipartisan group of senators say they want to investigate whether Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. election, amongst claims that Donald Trump's rhetoric on Russia and Vladimir Putin is too soft. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) \n \n I call this one the Lindsey O. Graham method: Call out those who disagree with you on Russia strategy, even if that person is the president. \n \n Or, perhaps, especially if that person is the president. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m going after Russia in every way you can go after Russia,\u201d the Republican South Carolina senator said Wednesday on CNN. \u201cI think they\u2019re one of the most destabilizing influences on the world stage. I think they did interfere with our elections, and I want [Russian President Vladimir] Putin personally to pay the price.\u201d \n \n This step probably creates the most chaos between Trump and his party, but it could be most effective if Republicans really do want to steer him away from Russia, Eoyang said. \n \n Democrats have been crying foul about Russia for some time now, but their words often get lost in everyday partisan bickering \u2014 especially when their side is the one that lost the presidential election. \n \n It raises eyebrows \u2014 and makes headlines \u2014 when Republicans are the ones critiquing their own president's position on Russia. And that could make it harder for Trump to ignore or dismiss. \n \n 4. Hope Russia shows its true colors \n \n \n \n Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin in Moscow. (Pool photo by Natalia Kolesnikova via Associated Press) \n \n Intelligence officials say there's \u201cconsensus\u201d in their community that Russia tried to sway the U.S. election in an \u201cunprecedented\u201d way. \n \n But you'd also be hard pressed to find a national security official who thinks Russia did this because it likes Trump, Eoyang said: \u201cIt's not like the Russians are partisan. They just want to see America weak.\u201d \n \n In other words, some national security experts say that they think it's only a matter of time until Russia decides it is in its interests to try to undermine Trump. \n \n And letting Russia make the case to Trump via its own actions that it is a foe, not a friend, could be one of the most effective ways \u2014 possibly the only effective way \u2014 for Russia-skeptical Republicans in Congress to get their president to actually see Moscow the way they do.",

Here are seven things you need to know: With Trump criticizing the CIA\u2014rather than Russia\u2014in the wake of the report, the New York Times reports he's opening an \"extraordinary breach\" between himself and the national security establishment he's bound to need during his presidency. While mostly at a loss, Michael Tomasky at the Daily Beast has a few pieces of advice for what Democrats should do next: \"Demand the release of the information. Demand a real investigation...The media needs to get the message that conservatives aren\u2019t the only people who get pissed off.\" In a \"no-win situation for the GOP,\" some Republicans in Congress want to investigate Russia's involvement in the election against Trump's wishes. The Washington Post has four ways they could take on Russia, with or without the president-elect. Harry Reid is calling for the resignation of FBI director James Comey, who he compares to J. Edgar Hoover and accuses of covering up information about Russia's activities to get Trump elected, the Guardian reports. Pamela Kruger at Fortune points out that Trump did Saturday what he normally does when faced with a major negative story: spend the morning tweeting about something completely unrelated; Celebrity Apprentice, in this case. Worried Trump will ignore Russian threats to US democracy when he takes office, Quartz reports President Obama is \"racing against the clock\" to get a full report on Russia's involvement in US affairs before he steps down in six weeks. Meanwhile, John McCain says the close relationship between Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson\u2014Trump's likely secretary of state\u2014and Vladimir Putin \"a matter of concern,\" the Hill reports. With Democrats needing only three GOP senators to vote against Tillerson, a McCain aide says a confirmation is unlikely. \"Putin is a thug, bully, and a murderer, and anybody else who describes him as anything else is lying,\" McCain says.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 On Friday, the Washington Post reported that the CIA had \"high confidence\" that Russian hackers tried to influence the US election in Donald Trump's favor. On Saturday morning, the president-elect took to Twitter to address the report. \"Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are ridiculous & untrue\u2014FAKE NEWS!\" he tweeted. He followed that up with: \"I have to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it. Will devote ZERO TIME!\" The tweet comes after Variety reported that Trump would continue to executive producer the reality-TV show and that he'd make \"hundreds of thousands\" of dollars a year from it. Trump has said in the past that he'd like to work on the show while he's in the White House, but it's not clear whether he'll be doing so while he's president. The New York Times reports that Trump's team issued a statement Friday attacking the CIA's credibility. \"These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,\" the statement said. \"The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Electoral College victories in history. It's now time to move on and 'Make America Great Again.'\" Former CIA agent Evan McMullin also weighed in on Friday, tweeting that \"Republican leaders knew Russia was undermining our democracy during the election and they chose to ignore it.\"",

The Secret Service placed the men on administrative leave pending an internal investigation. The agents \u2014 who were removed from Cartagena on Thursday and replaced with a new team shortly before Obama\u2019s arrival Friday \u2014 were returned to Washington and interviewed by the Office of Professional Responsibility, the agency\u2019s internal affairs unit. \n \n Meanwhile, the Defense Department has ordered its own inquiry after determining that five of its personnel, who were staying at the same hotel as the Secret Service agents, violated curfew on Wednesday night. All of the U.S. personnel were part of Obama\u2019s advance team that was preparing logistics and security for his arrival. \n \n The alleged misconduct came to light after one of the agents became involved in a dispute with a woman Thursday morning over a payment, and Colombian police reported the matter to the U.S. Embassy. \n \n The controversy has shifted some attention away from Obama\u2019s trip to the economic summit, at least in the United States, where the media have focused on the accusations of heavy drinking and womanizing. \n \n Obama was asked about the matter by a reporter in his joint news conference with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos.

Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \n \n He is scheduled to receive his first classified briefing as the Republican Party's presidential nominee, according to sources notified of the upcoming visit. \n \n Trump is planning to take with him New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, a former Defense Intelligence Agency director who has become an outspoken supporter of Trump, a senior campaign official said. \n \n Career staffers from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), the nation's top intelligence office, will be leading the briefing, which is expected to cover major threats and emerging concerns around the world. \n \n Trump's session comes two days after he laid out a series of foreign policy proposals, including plans for subjecting immigrants to \"extreme vetting\" and temporarily blocking immigration from \"the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world.\" \n \n Because of the sensitivity of the information discussed during briefings of presidential candidates, the sessions must take place in locations with secure rooms, known as sensitive compartmented information facilities. The FBI's office in New York City has such rooms. \n \n The FBI, however, will have no role in the briefing beyond playing host, ABC News was told. \n \n The decision to take Christie and Flynn with him could stoke speculation that Trump is considering them for positions in his Cabinet. \n \n Both spoke in support of Trump at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland last month. And \u2013 unlike Trump \u2013 both would have had to receive security clearances to attend the briefing. \n \n As a U.S. attorney under George W. Bush's administration, Christie ran the federal prosecutors' office in New Jersey for several years, and he is now leading Trump's transition team. \n \n In 2014, Flynn retired as the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency after a long career in military service. He has recently received criticism for some of his public positions, including a retweet of an anti-Semitic message and the posting of a tweet that read, \"Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.\" \n \n As for Trump, many of his critics, including top Democratic senators, have questioned whether he is fit to receive classified information, citing controversial statements he has made on the campaign trail. \n \n But DNI Director James Clapper and the White House recently said they have no qualms about briefing the Republican or Democratic presidential candidates, noting that providing the briefings is a \"long-standing tradition in our system,\" dating back more than 60 years. \n \n \"Ensuring a smooth transition to the next president is a top priority ... and that's important, in part, because of the significant threats around the world,\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters in Washington, D.C., last month. \n \n He said U.S. intelligence officials \"understand what steps are necessary to protect sensitive national security information, and the administration is confident that they can both provide relevant and sufficient briefings to the two major-party presidential candidates while also protecting sensitive national security information.\" \n \n Clapper said there is no concern in the U.S. intelligence community about providing classified information to either of the presidential candidates, insisting, \"It's not up to the administration and certainly not up to me personally to decide on the suitability of a presidential candidate.\" \n \n \"The American electorate is in the process of deciding the suitability of these two candidates to serve as commander in chief, and they will make that decision, to pick someone who will be cleared for everything,\" Clapper said at the annual Aspen Security Forum in Colorado last month. \n \n Each of the campaigns decides the location for the classified briefings, according to Clapper. \n \n Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton are each expected to receive two or three classified briefings before Election Day. \n \n These briefings resemble the annual Worldwide Threat Assessment issued by the intelligence community, which releases an unclassified version each year. While some top-secret information could be discussed, the briefings will not include the nation's most sensitive secrets, particularly information on sources, methods and operations. \n \n Trump began this week with a campaign rally in Youngstown, Ohio, where he laid out his plan to fight \"radical Islamic terrorism\" and \"make America safe again.\" \n \n He proposed subjecting immigrants who want to enter the United States to \"extreme vetting\" and a new ideological test, saying it would help ensure that only \"those who share our values and respect our people\" are admitted into the country. \n \n --ABC News' Veronica Stracqualursi, Justin Fishel, Alex Mallin and Devin Dwyer contributed to this report. ||||| Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump can be given classified intelligence briefings now that they are the Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, the top U.S. intelligence official said Thursday, despite calls from party leaders to limit the other candidate's access to national security secrets. \n \n \u201cWe will brief both candidates if they want it,\u201d James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, said at the Aspen Security Forum in Aspen, Colo. \n \n The candidates don\u2019t need a security clearance to receive the briefing, Clapper said. He said they both are entitled to get classified information because they now are the major party nominees. \n \n Sharing intelligence assessments with presidential nominees is a tradition that goes back to Harry Truman, who signed the law that created the CIA in 1947. \n \n Senior officials in both parties have sought to turn this year's closed-door briefings into a campaign issue. \n \n After the FBI director said this month that Clinton had been extremely careless but had broken no laws by using a private email server while secretary of State, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) urged Clapper to deny classified material to her. \n \n Giving the Democratic nominee access, he wrote in a letter, would \u201csend the wrong signal to all those charged with safeguarding our nations\u2019 secrets.\" \n \n Clinton is scheduled to accept her party's nomination tonight at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. \n \n Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), in turn, said that U.S. intelligence analysts should \"fake it\" if they are ordered to brief Trump, a businessman who has never held elected office. \n \n \"If you're forced to brief this guy, don't tell him anything,\" he told the Huffington Post. \"Just fake it because this man is dangerous.\" \n \n Intelligence officials say election briefings to presidential nominees tend to be chiefly analysis of current events and leaders, and do not include highly classified details of spying sources and methods. \n \n Clapper said this year's heated campaign rhetoric has been \u201cvery bothersome\u201d to U.S. allies. \n \n \u201cI hear that from my counterparts who take very, very seriously and study very, very closely what political figures in this country say and it is worrying to them,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cI tell them that it is part of our process in the United States and, hopefully, it will all come out right.\u201d",

The limited edition Karlbox, of course. This unique art supply storage box launched earlier this month exclusively at Gump's of San Francisco, Faber-Castell stores, Karl Lagerfeld boutiques worldwide and Harrods, London. Later this month the Karlbox will be available at select department and specialty stores. \n \n Designed by Lagerfeld, the elegant black box holds 350 Faber-Castell art tools for drawing and painting. Its wood exterior resembles a Chinese wedding cabinet, while inside well-crafted removable drawers store the art supplies. Not so incidentally, the shades of colors included were personally selected by Lagerfeld to represent his aesthetic and the relationship between fashion, art and design. \n \n \u201cSince I was a child in Germany, Faber-Castell has been the most famous brand, known for its especially good quality,\u201d said Lagerfeld. \u201cThat reputation remains just as true today, particularly for artist pencils.\u201d \n \n During his long career, it seems the designer has used Faber-Castell products to produce countless works of art. \n \n \u201cTo me, drawing is like breathing and writing,\u201d he explains. \u201cThese are things that almost relax me.\u201d \n \n But this is no ordinary relaxation like you and I might enjoy. Rather it is a wellspring of creativity that takes shape on the page before him. From fashion and design to writing and penmanship, Lagerfeld turns to pen and paper to concretize his ideas, with each swoop of pencil or pastel expressing his unique vision. \n \n Specifically, the lacquered beech wood Karlbox holds a varied selection of premium artists\u2019 tools, including Albrecht D\u00fcrer and Polychromos color pencils, highly pigmented Pitt Artist ink pens, Castell 9000 graphite pencils and Pitt crayons and pastels. Watercolor brushes and accessories, like a foldable water cup, an eraser and sharpeners, are also included. Shades are sorted by primary and secondary colors, which range from soft pastels to vibrant and intense hues. According to Lagerfeld, his favorite product line is the Albrecht D\u00fcrer artist range of water-soluble color pencils, and all 120 shades are included. \n \n Lagerfeld is known for a wide range of luxury goods, including ready-to-wear for men, women and children, accessories, bags, watches and eyewear. These collections are complemented by \u201cLagerfeld,\u201d a line of casual urban menswear and premium fragrances, which were added to the portfolio in 2014. In 2015, the company announced the launch of its online global women\u2019s flagship store on Karl.com. \n \n Faber-Castell, too, is no stranger to elegance and refined design. As one of the world\u2019s oldest manufacturers of writing instruments\u2014it was founded as a pencil factory in 1761 in Stein, Germany\u2014it is a family-owned company embracing more than eight generations. In addition to high-end pens in its Graf line, its Art & Graphic product range embodies 255 years of experience in the design and manufacture of exclusive artist products. Renowned artists including Vincent van Gogh, Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka and Neo Rauch were fans of the brand\u2019s assortment of color products and the quality they exemplified. \n \n Every one-of-a-kind Karlbox includes a serial number and certificate of authenticity, making each completely unique. Just 2,400 have been produced, individually priced at $2,850, which seems like a bargain considering its size and provenance. ||||| The KARLBOX unites the traditional values of the family-owned company Faber-Castell with the modern, unique and innovative spirit and style of KARL LAGERFELD. It is a symbol for the long term relationship of both brands and represents the symbiosis of the fashion, art and design worlds. \n \n The KARLBOX is a limited edition of 2.500 pieces worldwide. \n \n Every box comes with a serial number plate and a certificate of authenticity. ||||| Expand \n \n No matter how distant the days of Five Star notebooks and three-ring binders, the first week of September always manages to usher in a familiar feeling of going back to school, particularly for those studied in the house of Chanel. Case in point is Karl Lagerfeld, who today announced he has teamed up with Faber-Castell to create a brand-spanking-new set of fine artist tools. The limited-edition collection is fittingly labeled Karlbox with a slogan that reads: \u201cColours in black.\u201d Only 2,500 have been made and each boasts its own unique serial number as well as a certificate of authenticity and a steep $2,850 price tag. Vogue.com can exclusively reveal that the Kaiser himself has already ordered five\u2014one for each of his international offices. \n \n Far from your average store-bought Crayola fare, Karlbox comes luxuriously equipped with a staggering 350 different premium-grade supplies for drawing and painting, including Lagerfeld\u2019s own personal favorite product line, the Albrecht D\u00fcrer artist\u2019s water-soluble color pencils\u2014all 120 shades of them. Everything is housed in an \u00fcber-chic black lacquered box designed by Lagerfeld. The beech wooden frame is reminiscent of a Chinese wedding cabinet; inside, drawers store utensils carefully sorted by primary and secondary color palettes that range from soft pastels to bolder pigmentations, all of which have been handpicked by the couturier. \n \n Expand \n \n The color family found in each section is thoughtfully etched along the side spelled out in three different languages: English, French, and German.

These are the things that almost relax me,\u201d said the designer in a press release. Lagerfeld is fluent in the delicate synergy between fashion and design, and is said to often turn to pen and paper when bringing his new ideas to life. Of course, the first lesson in the art of expressing oneself is all about having the right tools, making the Karlbox collection expertly tailored to seriously stylish adults this back-to-school season.

    "document": "CLOSE More women are buying breat milk online, but a study by Nationwide Children's Hospital discovered high levels of bacteria. Courtesy Nationwide Children's Hospital Nationwide Children's Hospital \n \n Researchers find high levels of bacteria that can make infants sick in breast milk purchased via the Internet. \n \n Despite safety concerns, new mothers are increasingly buying and selling milk over the Internet. A recent study by researchers at Nationwide Children's Hospital found that 75% of the breast milk they bought online was contaminated with high levels of bacteria. (Photo: Nationwide Children's Hospital) Story Highlights The selling of breast milk to others over the Web has become a growing trend \n \n Researchers found high counts of harmful bacteria and even fecal contamination in the milk \n \n The findings were likely the result of poor collection, storage or shipping practices \n \n Thanks to the Internet, women who produce an abundant supply of breast milk and those in need of it for their babies have more opportunities than ever to connect. But a first-of-its-kind study finds high levels of harmful bacteria and contamination in breast milk purchased via the Web. \n \n Researchers' analysis of 100 samples of breast milk bought on a public milk-sharing website found three in four samples contained either high levels of bacterial growth overall or contained disease-causing bacteria, including fecal contamination. \n \n The findings were likely the result of poor hygiene during milk collection, the use of either unclean containers or unsanitary breast milk pump parts, or compromised shipping practices, says epidemiologist Sarah Keim, lead author of the study in November's Pediatrics, published online today. \n \n Nineteen percent of sellers did not include dry ice or another cooling method when shipping, according to the study. \n \n It is unknown exactly how common purchasing breast milk online is, but a soon-to-be published journal article by Keim found 13,000 postings on U.S. milk sharing websites in 2011. \n \n It is \"totally normal\" for there to be certain bacteria in human breast milk, says Keim, a principal investigator with the Center for Biobehavioral Health at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Some are \"very important and healthy for babies and the development of their immune system and digestive system,\" she says. \n \n This study focused on bacteria which \"are generally pretty harmless as long as they don't grow out of control\" but have also been associated with illnesses in infants linked to contaminated milk, including staphylococcus and streptococcus, says Keim. It also focused on bacteria associated with disease even at low levels, such as salmonella and E. coli. \n \n Researchers compared the online-purchased breast milk samples to samples of unpasteurized breast milk donated to a non-profit milk bank. \n \n Twelve such banks throughout the U.S. follow strict guidelines set by the Human Milk Banking Association of North America and provide pasteurized milk from carefully screened donors to fragile and premature infants, primarily in hospitals. Pasteurization kills the harmful bacteria before the milk reaches an infant. \n \n In all the samples analyzed, the Web-purchased milk had higher bacteria counts and were more likely to contain disease-related types of bacteria, even though the donated milk from the milk banks had yet to be pasteurized: \n \n -- 72% had any detectable gram-negative bacteria, which are associated with bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections, meningitis and fecal contamination vs. 35% of milk bank samples \n \n -- 63% tested positive for staphylococcus vs. 25% of milk bank samples \n \n -- 36% tested positive for streptococcus vs. 20% of milk bank samples \n \n -- 3% were contaminated with salmonella vs. none of the milk bank samples. \n \n All of the samples tested negative for HIV, says Keim, but the laboratory analysis to determine \"the authenticity\" of the breast milk is just beginning, she says, adding: \"We're a little suspicious of some of the milk.\" \n \n \"This study confirms what people have suspected in terms of online milk purchases,\" says Anne Eglash, a family medicine physician with University of Wisconsin Health in Mt. Horeb and a co-founder of the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine. She was not involved in the new study. \n \n \"You don't know what you're getting, you don't know the quality, how honest people are about how old the milk is, and so many other issues. It's important to realize that this may not be the safest way to get breast milk when you don't have enough,\" she says. \n \n But Eglash, co-medical director of the still-in-development Mother's Milk Bank of the Western Great Lakes, cautions against \"throwing the baby out with the bathwater\" when it comes to the sharing of raw, unpasteurized human breast milk between lactating women and those who cannot, for medical or other reasons, provide their own milk for their healthy, full-term babies. \n \n \"I don't think the message should be that women should never share milk, but that this behavior of buying it on the Web from someone you don't know should not happen,\" she says. Eglash emphasizes that \"you don't want unpasteurized milk that has various bacteria going to an infant whose immune system is vulnerable,\" but says there are safe ways to share human breast milk with healthy infants who are not your own, as well as pasteurize it at home. \n \n The Food and Drug Administration warns against feeding babies breast milk acquired directly from individuals or through the Internet, citing safety concerns; the American Academy of Pediatrics discourages feeding preterm infants human breast milk from unscreened donors. \n \n Keim, author of the new study, says her findings \"may not apply to situations where milk is shared among friends or relatives or donated rather than sold. The potential risks of those situations are less well understood.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1gwTueV ||||| \u201cWe worried at first,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to be mindful that the donors were healthy, but there was never a moment when we were afraid. We\u2019ve had the milk of about 30 women and have never had a problem.\u201d \n \n Women who do not wish to rely on an informal network may turn to breast milk banks, which store and sell breast milk from donors. Thirteen banks in the United States and Canada follow voluntary guidelines set up by the Human Milk Banking Association of North America, which require that donors and donations be screened, and that milk be pasteurized. \n \n But milk banks give priority to premature infants with significant medical complications, and the milk is available only by prescription. A bank will supply milk by prescription to healthy infants, but only if sufficient supplies are available \u2014 and they rarely are. The association\u2019s banks distributed 2.15 million ounces in 2011, but the current annual need is 9 million ounces. \n \n Even when it is available, milk from banks is expensive, as much as $6 an ounce, and the average intake of a 1-month-old is about 25 ounces a day. \n \n All of this encourages new parents, often scrambling to find breast milk on short notice, to shop for cheaper or more convenient sources, and Web sites including onlythebreast.com and eatsonfeets.org have sprung up to fill the demand. In 2011, there were more than 13,000 postings on the four leading milk-sharing Web sites, according to Sarah Keim, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Ohio State and a researcher at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. \n \n Photo \n \n In using any of these services, the buyer relies on the representations of the seller. The new study suggests that may prove hazardous. \n \n Today\u2019s Headlines Wake up each morning to the day\u2019s top news, analysis and opinion delivered to your inbox.

Then the researchers analyzed the bacterial content in the samples, comparing them with unpasteurized breast milk from screened donors at banks. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The researchers found that 64 percent of the samples from milk-sharing sites were contaminated with staph, 36 percent with strep, and almost three-quarters with other bacterial species. Three of the samples contained salmonella. Seventy-four percent of the samples would have failed milk bank criteria. \n \n The unpasteurized milk bank samples were not entirely free of contamination either, but they were considerably cleaner than those from the online milk-sharers \u2014 25 percent were contaminated with staph, 20 percent with strep, and 35 percent with other types of bacteria. Twenty-five percent of the milk bank samples contained no detectable bacteria at all, compared with 9 percent of the samples from milk-sharing sites. \n \n \u201cMost staph and strep are harmless at normal levels,\u201d Dr. Keim said. \u201cBut some of the levels we found were very high.\u201d Nine percent of the milk-sharing samples contained dangerous levels of staph, and a handful had unusually high strep levels. Salmonella \u201cdoesn\u2019t belong in milk at all,\u201d she said. \n \n Dr. Keim gave high marks to the milk banks. \u201cWhen you donate to one of the H.M.B.A.N.A. banks, you know it\u2019s been processed and made safe for a baby who really needs it.\u201d \n \n All milk shipped from milk banks is pasteurized, which kills skin and gastrointestinal bacteria, as well as many viruses, including those that cause colds. But pasteurization also destroys some of the beneficial substances in breast milk. \n \n Kim Updegrove, president of the milk bank association, believes that however well intended, informal sharing of breast milk can be hazardous. \n \n \u201cIf you get milk from an unscreened sharer, you put your child at risk,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate to say this to an informal sharer, because they are trying to do good. But they are playing a game of Russian roulette.\u201d \n \n The Food and Drug Administration does not regulate the buying or selling of breast milk, but the agency discourages both online and person-to-person sharing. Only three states \u2014 California, Maryland and New York \u2014 regulate milk banks. New York, for instance, specifies rules for collection and storage of breast milk, and requires that donors be screened and periodically re-evaluated in a process overseen by a physician. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Dr. Keim said there is no way for a consumer to be certain what she is getting from an online source. \n \n \u201cWe looked at everything a buyer could know herself \u2014 temperature, the condition of the containers, how long it took to ship, what sellers were saying in their ads \u2014 and only the time in transit had any effect on contamination. \n \n \u201cBuyers have no way of knowing even what they\u2019re getting \u2014 it could be cow\u2019s milk or formula.\u201d ||||| Informal sharing of human milk has been gaining popularity in the U.S., spurred by research suggesting breast-fed babies are healthier than those fed formula.

Bacteria found included E. coli, staphylococcus, streptococcus, and even salmonella, the Wall Street Journal reports. The FDA does not regulate the breast milk market, though it discourages sharing, the New York Times reports. Breast milk can be sold or donated on dozens of websites, and while some suppliers hand off the milk in person, others ship it. Problems during collection (improper hand-washing, dirty breast pumps or containers), improper storage (19% of the samples in the study were not cooled), and long shipping times (some of the samples took as long as six days to arrive) likely contributed to the health hazards. Another potential problem: Researchers say they are \"a little suspicious of some of the milk,\" and are now working to determine if it's authentic breast milk, USA Today reports.

Still\u2014when they break into perfect three-part harmony, they totally crush it. \n \n \n \n Would-be first daughters (from left): \n \n Liddy, Mary Anne, and Abby Huntsman. \n \n The Huntsman daughters' three-headed social-media presence is a mischievous, seemingly unfiltered corrective to the stage-managed sneering of the campaign. A few months ago, the Herman Cain campaign posted a bizarre ad in which Mark Block, Cain's mustachioed chief of staff, enumerates his boss's virtues in tough-guy close-up. At the end, he takes a defiant, Denis Leary\u2013ish puff on a cigarette. Even in the context of a Republican race already shaping up as the Battle of Who Can Come Off Like a Bigger Assclown Before Losing the Nomination to Mitt Romney, this was weird. Liddy, the youngest Jon2012girl, whose dream is to work for a show like Saturday Night Live someday, couldn't believe it. \n \n \"I was stunned that this was a legit commercial,\" she says. Plus, she was home from college and bored. So she and her sisters shot a Funny or Die\u2013style parody of the ad that doubled as a Huntsman spot. They wore fake mustaches; instead of smoking, they blew bubbles. It went viral, and for at least the length of a news cycle, they were more famous than Jon Huntsman himself. Even Mark Block was impressed. When Mary Anne ran into him before a debate in South Carolina, she told him how much she loved his ad. \"I loved your ad,\" he responded. \n \n Today the touch-screen menus on the karaoke machine are user-unfriendly, and most of the songs are in Chinese. A determined Liddy pokes at one until it coughs up Gwen Stefani's \"Hollaback Girl\"\u2014the girls sing shhhh when Gwen says shit\u2014and gradually, despite the presence of a photographer, sisterly goofiness ensues. This is definitely not the first time they've sung LeAnn Rimes's \"Can't Fight the Moonlight.\" \n \n Afterward they talk (shrewdly yet idealistically) about using new technology to reach young voters disillusioned by Obama's failure to deliver all that hope and change he promised the Facebook generation, and how off-the-cuff sass is the only way to speak to an audience that gets its news from Jon Stewart and Twitter. They explain, politely, that no, they're not angling for gigs on Fox (\"I'm not blonde,\" Abby points out sagely), nor are they trying to be the Kardashians of politics. Abby, who used to be in PR and works hardest to keep her sisters on-message, explains that their parents raised them to give back. Every night, she says, \"they'd ask us what we'd done that day to make someone's life a little better, to make someone smile or whatever. I know that sounds cheesy\u2014but that's the philosophy we were raised with.\" Campaigning for Dad is their way of doing that. \n \n Before the girls arrived, Huntsman's campaign spokesman called to warn me that Liddy has yet to fully grasp what \"on the record\" means, although he needn't have bothered. When I mention the Kardashians, it's Liddy who volunteers the information that Mary Anne once went on a date with Kim's now estranged husband, Kris Humphries, when he was on the Utah Jazz. \n \n \"Liddy!\" Mary Anne says, mortified. \n \n But it's true. They saw Elf; Humphries bought a bucket of popcorn the size of a garbage can. Mary Anne never heard another thing about him until he turned up on E!, dating a reality-TV queen. \n \n \"You're gonna get me in trouble,\" Anne says. \n \n Liddy takes a sip of water. \"I'm just trying to make someone smile.\"",

Robert Safran said. \n \n The news station notified the police department, and investigators asked her to stop talking to Brinkman, Safran said. The conversation ended at that time, he said. \n \n \"We got the impression that [Brinkman] wanted to get his story out there before we released any more information,\" Safran said Tuesday afternoon. \n \n WOIO-Channel 19 reporter Lacey Crisp reached out to Brinkman on Monday because he is friends on Facebook with three women found dead Sunday in North Royalton, according to a story posted on the news channel's website. Investigators on Tuesday identified Brinkman as a suspect in the homicides. \n \n \"She saw him as a family friend, so she reached out to him on Facebook,\" WOIO-Channel 19 news director Fred D'Ambrosi said Tuesday in a phone interview. \n \n Brinkman initially agreed to an on-camera interview to discuss the three women and his relationship to them. But he later revealed he was at the standoff scene in Brunswick, D'Ambrosi said. \n \n The news channel contacted the police department because it was unclear at the time if others might be in the house with Brinkman, and possibly in danger, D'Ambrosi said. \n \n \"We made the ethical decision that we needed to let the police know,\" he said. \n \n Crisp asked Brinkman to surrender, but Brinkman later accused her of working with police and said she \"stabbed [him] in the back,\" the news channel's story says. \n \n Brinkman also denied any involvement in the homicides and said he broke his hand days earlier at work, the story says. \n \n Brinkman is charged with murder in the deaths of Lake Township residents Rogell Eugene John, 71, and his wife Roberta Ray John, 64, the Stark County Sheriff's Office said.

Investigators did not recover a knife at the crime scene. \n \n Investigators learned Monday that Brinkman was at a woman's home on Valley Forge Drive in Brunswick.

Brinkman, Jr., 45, of Brunswick was being held by North Royalton Police Tuesday afternoon. Brinkman was taken into custody after a nearly 9 hour standoff in Brunswick that ended around 5:30 a.m. \n \n North Royalton Police Detective Dave Loeding said Brinkman is suspected in the murders of Suzanne Taylor, 45, and her daughters Taylor Pifer, 21, and Kylie Pifer, 18, whose bodies were discovered in their Ridge Road home Sunday. \n \n Stark County Sheriff George Maier said Brinkman is facing murder charges in the shooting deaths of Rogell Eugene John II, 71, and his wife, Roberta Ray John, 64, discovered at a home on Mt. Pleasant NE in Lake Township Monday afternoon. \n \n Loeding said the three women killed in North Royalton were found on a bed, and Taylor's throat had been cut with a knife. He said there were no outward signs of a cause of death of her daughters. \n \n \"I'm just devastated. I don't understand it. I don't understand why somebody would do something like this,\" said Marcia Taylor, mother of Suzanne Taylor. \n \n Relatives told Fox 8 News that Brinkman and Taylor both graduated from Valley Forge High School and were longtime friends but were not romantically involved. \n \n \"Suzy thought he was actually really a friend. We had meals together, he spent holidays here, I mean, he was a friend, so I don't know what made him so angry,\" Taylor said. \n \n Taylor's brother, Ken Taylor, said Brinkman may have become jealous because he wanted the relationship to be more than friendly. \n \n \"He always wanted more from my sister, and she was just trying to be nice to him,\" he said. Police confirmed Brinkman knew the victims but could not elaborate on the relationship, motive or evidence found at the crime scene. \n \n \"Motive is very difficult. Sometimes it's hard to establish what the motive is. You're asking me to know what went on in his mind and why. I do not know. We'll come to know that hopefully,\" Loeding said. \n \n Maier said Brinkman was employed at the Johns's business and had recently been house sitting for them while they were on vacation. He was the ex-boyfriend of their daughter, Maier said. The murders in Stark County happened after the murders in North Royalton, according to Maier. \n \n Brunswick Police said a U.S. Marshal's Office task force tracked Brinkman to a friend's home in Brunswick Monday night. Police officers entered the home Tuesday morning, using a taser on Brinkman who was taken to a hospital for evaluation before being transported to the North Royalton Police Department. \n \n In 1999, Brinkman was convicted of several charges including receiving stolen property and unauthorized access to a computer. He served time in prison for violating the terms of community control in that case. \n \n A vigil for the North Royalton victims is planned for 8:30 p.m. Wednesday in front of North Royalton High School.",

He said his father and elder brother had encouraged him. \n \n After that, it showed Musallam being escorted to a field and then being shot in the head by a boy, described by an older, French-speaking fighter as one of the \"cubs of the caliphate\". \n \n Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage, which also appeared on Twitter feeds used by Islamic State supporters. \n \n Israeli security officials said they were aware of the video but could not confirm that it was authentic. \n \n The video, which was about 13 minutes long, showed Musallam on his knees as he listened to the older fighter delivering the verdict in French. \n \n Then the boy, wearing a military uniform and armed with a pistol, stands face to face with Musallam and fires one bullet into his forehead. After Musallam collapsed, the child shot him three more times and chanted \"Allahu Akbar!\" (God is greatest). \n \n In the video, Musallam repeated what he had said last month in an interview published by the group's English language magazine Dabiq, in which he said he had joined Islamic State to report to the Israelis on weapons caches, bases and Palestinian recruits. Israel and his family denied that he was an Israeli spy. \n \n \"I tell my father and my son: Repent to God.

Behind him stand two figures in camouflage fatigues, one of whom appears to be a boy. \n \n The boy appears to shoot the kneeling figure in the head with a handgun and then to fire further shots into the body. \n \n The video then carries a warning from an older, French-speaking militant aimed at the Jewish people. \n \n French media and IS supporters identified the older militant as Sabri Essid. He is reportedly a half-brother of Mohamed Merah, who killed three unarmed French soldiers, a rabbi and three small children at a Jewish school in France in 2012. ||||| Sky News has spoken to a former member of Islamic State, who claims he witnessed the man known as Jihadi John murder Japanese hostage Kenji Goto. \n \n The former translator said that the masked man in the video was indeed Mohammed Emwazi, the 26-year-old Londoner who has become the face of the world's most notorious terrorist organisation. \n \n \"Saleh\" said Emwazi is employed as the chief killer of foreign hostages for Islamic State's media wing and that his murderous influence among the group is feared and respected. \n \n Speaking in March from Turkey, where he fled to escape IS, Saleh explained in broken English how he was employed by the group to convince foreign hostages they were safe. \n \n He is the only person to admit seeing Emwazi kill. \n \n Play video \"Kuwaiti Ambassador On 'Jihadi John'\" Video: Kuwaiti Ambassador On 'Jihadi John' \n \n He said: \"When he killed Kenji Goto I live showed this [saw this] but not near, from a little [distance]. \n \n \"After he was killed him, three or four person come and take over the body and put in a car.

    "document": "Brain Wars How the Military Is Failing Its Wounded \n \n A version of this story was co-produced with NPR and aired on All Things Considered. (Check here for local listings.) \n \n In 2007, with roadside bombs exploding across Iraq, Congress moved to improve care for soldiers who had suffered one of the war's signature wounds, traumatic brain injury. \n \n Lawmakers passed a measure requiring the military to test soldiers' brain function before they deployed and again when they returned. The test was supposed to ensure that soldiers received proper treatment. \n \n Instead, an investigation by ProPublica and NPR has found, the testing program has failed to deliver on its promise, offering soldiers the appearance of help, but not the reality. \n \n Racing to satisfy Congress' mandate, the military chose a test that wasn't actually proven to detect TBI: the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric, or ANAM. \n \n Four years later, more than a million troops have taken the test at a cost of more than $42 million to taxpayers, yet the military still has no reliable way to catch brain injuries. When such injuries are left undetected, it can delay healing and put soldiers at risk for further mental damage. \n \n Based on corporate and government records, confidential documents, scores of interviews and emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, our investigation found: \n \n The people who invented ANAM and stood to make money from it were involved in the military's decision to use it, prompting questions about the impartiality of the selection process. No other tests received serious consideration. A report by the Army's top neuropsychologist circulated last year to key members of Congress labeled the selection process \"nepotistic.\" \n \n The Pentagon's civilian leadership has ignored years of warnings, public and private, that there was insufficient scientific evidence the ANAM can screen for or diagnose traumatic brain injury. The military's highest-ranking medical official said the test was \"fraught with problems.\" Another high-ranking officer said it could yield misleading results. \n \n Compounding flaws in the ANAM's design, the military has not administered the test as recommended and has rarely used its results. The Army has so little confidence in the test that its top medical officer issued an explicit order that soldiers whose scores indicated cognitive problems should not be sent for further medical evaluation. \n \n Top Pentagon officials have misrepresented the cost of the test, indicating that because the Army invented the ANAM, the military could use it for free. In fact, because the military licensed its invention to outside contractors, it has paid millions of dollars to use its own technology. \n \n The military has not conducted a long-promised head-to-head study to make sure the ANAM is the best available test, delaying it for years. Instead, a series of committees have given lukewarm approval to continue using the ANAM, largely to avoid losing the data gathered so far. \n \n Several current and former military medical officials criticized the Defense Department's embrace of a scientifically unproven tool to use on hundreds of thousands of soldiers with TBIs. \n \n \"The test was not developed for the purposes of identifying the kinds of problems that we see in concussions,\" said Dr. Stephen Xenakis, a retired brigadier general and former adviser on mental health issues to the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. The test was picked \"without asking ourselves the questions: what are we trying to achieve here and what are we going to use the screenings for?\" \n \n Army Surgeon General Eric Schoomaker acknowledged there have been problems with the testing program and called it a \"first step.\" \n \n \"The Army recognized all along that it was not an optimal test,\" Schoomaker said in a written statement to ProPublica and NPR. He added that the Army has tried to improve the ANAM test and is comparing it to alternatives. \n \n Many experts in the field say Congress' mandate for testing went beyond what science can provide. There is no computerized test that, on its own, allows doctors to diagnose TBI. \n \n Yet studies have indicated the ANAM shows promise when used immediately after a blast, helping doctors determine if soldiers are sharp enough to return to duty. Other studies, as yet unpublished, show the test may also be able to detect certain cognitive problems months after a brain injury. \n \n Those most familiar with the ANAM program insist that testing can be of significant value if used properly -- and that this is where the military has gone wrong. \n \n \"We have failed soldiers,\" says retired Col. Mary Lopez, who used to manage the Army's testing program. \"It is incredibly frustrating because I can see first-hand the soldiers that we've missed, the soldiers that have not been treated, not been identified, [or] misdiagnosed. And then they struggle.\" \n \n A Test to Identify Invisible Wounds \n \n On a crisp morning in early September, about 40 uniformed soldiers mill around outside a squat rectangular building on the Fort Lewis-McChord military base near Tacoma, Wash. \n \n They are scheduled to ship out to Afghanistan in a matter of weeks and must take the ANAM before they go. Filing into the testing facility, they take seats in front of computers. \n \n ANAM proctor Felix Rios, a former first sergeant who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, does a quick Power Point presentation on the test. There will be 20 minutes of questions covering basic math, memory and reaction time. \n \n Taking the ANAM is the first step in protecting soldiers from the effects of brain injuries, Rios tells the group. \n \n \"One of the best ways to tell if something's affecting you is to know how you were before it happened. That's what you do here with ANAM,\" Rios says. \n \n The soldiers leave feeling comforted. \n \n \"I felt reassured,\" Lt. Benjamin Lewis Westman said after completing the test. It was good, \"knowing that the Army is taking steps to ensure people are taken care of.\" \n \n The military's foray into cognitive testing reflects the types of wounds troops have sustained fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n \n Soldiers have suffered an epidemic of concussions, also known as mild traumatic brain injuries, in bombings by insurgents. While most troops recovered quickly, some developed long-term cognitive problems. They couldn't think, read, write or remember the way they had. \n \n Too often, their injuries were missed on the battlefield and, even after they returned home, eluded more sophisticated scanning technology: Studies showed that up to 40 percent of troops who sustained concussions went undiagnosed. \n \n After a 2007 Washington Post series exposed the grim condition of soldiers with brain injuries at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Congress pushed to create a program to screen soldiers for such wounds. \n \n It's not surprising that the military, under pressure to act quickly, looked to the ANAM. There's no scientific consensus supporting one computerized neurocognitive test among the half-dozen or so available. \n \n ANAM had been developed in-house. Starting in the early 1980s, scientists at Fort Detrick, the military's primary research base, conceived the test as a way to measure pilots' reflexes or to see if a paratrooper could think clearly after a rough landing. \n \n The fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan spurred researchers to re-envision the test: Could ANAM help doctors assess cognitive damage from concussions? In the summer of 2007, as Congress pressed the military for a testing solution, the ANAM was administered to thousands of soldiers from the 101st Airborne at Fort Campbell in Kentucky as part of a pilot program. \n \n \"We had developed it ...and we owned it,\" said Lopez, who helped launch the pilot project, of the ANAM. \"We pushed it and we ran as fast as possible because we knew we had a huge problem with TBI.\" \n \n The Inside Track \n \n Other factors also tilted the selection process in ANAM's favor, sparking a lingering debate over whether the interests of the test's developers trumped those of soldiers. \n \n In February 2007, researchers at Fort Detrick paid the publisher of the Archives of Clinical Neuropsychology to release a supplemental issue on ANAM, including several articles that endorsed its use in detecting traumatic brain injury. Some of the authors had a financial stake in the test, owning patents or trademarks on it, and others received military contracts and funding to help develop the ANAM, but the details of their interests weren't disclosed. \n \n Dr. Robert Kane, the ANAM researcher hired by the military lab to edit the journal issue, said that the journal didn't require such financial disclosures, but \"in retrospect, patent information could have been provided.\" \n \n In October 2007, when the military convened a panel of experts to weigh the ANAM's pros and cons, the journal issue was among its primary sources of information, according to internal emails between panel members and senior military medical officials. In addition, several ANAM developers testified at the panel's sole meeting and one even sat on the committee. \n \n \"It just screams conflict of interest,\" said Professor Marcia Angell, a former editor of the New England Journal of Medicine who is now a senior lecturer on social medicine at Harvard Medical School. \"I mean here you have a situation where the same people are sellers, buyers and evaluators.\" \n \n The ANAM patent and trademark owners interviewed for this article, including Col. Karl Friedl who helped develop the ANAM and was listed as a member of the scientific advisory panel, described their involvement in the deliberations as peripheral and said their financial interest in the test was small and had no bearing on their remarks. \n \n \"Any inference that the government inventors would make money from DoD's use of the product and would recommend it for financial reasons are completely erroneous,\" said Kathryn Winter, one of the ANAM researchers who attended the meeting. Winter said she had made less than $5,000 in royalties from ANAM sales so far, though she could receive more in the future. \n \n Panel members were hardly blind to the ANAM's flaws. In their report, they noted there was no scientific proof that the test could work in the field and acknowledged that it hadn't been subjected to rigorous peer review. \n \n The committee recommended ANAM anyway. \n \n \"Nobody was enamored of it, but there was a decision made to use it,\" said former Navy Capt. Morgan Sammons, a psychologist who served as a co-chairman of the panel. \n \n In May 2008, S. Ward Casscells, then the senior civilian Pentagon official in charge of health affairs, issued an order to use the ANAM across the military. \n \n Competitors who pitched other testing software maintain the playing field was slanted and that soldiers have been ill-served. \n \n \"It remains unfathomable why the procurement process at the top was maneuvered so that soldiers were denied useful and usable screening tools for the signature injuries of these wars,\" said Don Comrie, chief executive of PanMedix, Inc., which markets a competitive test. \"As a result we still don't know who was exposed to a blast and what, if anything, is wrong with them.\" \n \n Casscells and Schoomaker say the selection process was comprehensive and fair. \n \n But some researchers, including retired Lt. Col. Michael Russell, the head of the Army's testing program, say the National Hockey League managed to pick a better test than the Pentagon did. \n \n The NHL evaluated five tests, looking for the option that was most accurate, best supported by research, and easiest to use for trainers and players, many of whom were not English speakers. \n \n It chose the ImPact, a 20-minute computerized test that requires the athlete to remember and then reconstruct a series of designs and patterns. By the beginning of 2007, every player had taken a baseline test. \n \n Several NFL teams also use the ImPact, as does Army Special Forces, which said it based its decision on a review of scientific literature. \n \n Russell, the military's leading civilian neuropsychologist, called the ANAM a poor choice. \n \n \"If they had said, would you like to use something else, I probably would have said, yes, I'd like to use something else,\" he said. \n \n Internal Skeptics Hobble Testing Effort \n \n During and after the selection process, the testing program was met with deep skepticism from top military medical officers, internal correspondence obtained by ProPublica and NPR shows. \n \n In a series of emails, Col. Charles Hoge, a leading Army psychiatrist, warned senior members of the medical command that the evidence supporting the ANAM, or any tool like it, was flimsy and that using it to screen soldiers for brain injuries could lead to misdiagnoses. \n \n \"Rolling out ANY diagnostic or clinical test on a population level ... without objective and reliable criteria for how the data will be interpreted and used is malpractice,\" Hoge wrote in November 2007 to several senior medical officials. \n \n Lt. Col. Mike Jaffee -- a neurologist then in charge of the military's premier brain injury center and a member of the panel that recommended the ANAM -- responded that the military didn't have a better option. \"There are currently no instruments that have been validated for blast or combat TBI,\" he wrote. \n \n The decision to use the ANAM was based on politics, not science, Jaffee acknowledged to Hoge. \n \n \"The bottom line is because of the political situation we have been told that studying the situation before acting is not an acceptable option\" to the Defense Department, he wrote. \n \n \"Congress can mandate till the cows come home,\" Hoge shot back. \"The right thing to do is to go back and help Congress to understand what is feasible and achievable.\" \n \n When Casscells issued the order to administer the ANAM to all troops before deployment, the Army's top medical officer pushed back. \n \n In a confidential email obtained by ProPublica and NPR, then Army Surgeon General Eric Schoomaker told Casscells that more than 30 military and civilian neuropsychologists, researchers and other experts had reviewed the ANAM at an Army symposium in June 2008. \n \n \"All were very cautious about the application of this technology -- it is not FDA-approved for screening for a mild TBI/concussion and has not been evaluated for sensitivity/specificity in this setting,\" Schoomaker wrote. \"Its use in this regard is fraught with problems.\" \n \n Three minutes later, Casscells dashed off a two-sentence reply -- \"Thanks for these wise caveats. Your scholarly standards!\" -- but his order stood. In a recent interview, Casscells said he and Schoomaker came to an understanding on the ANAM \"that half a loaf was better than none.\" \n \n Schoomaker subsequently issued an order mandating the use of the ANAM across the Army, prompting another round of internal protests. In a November 2008 email, one senior adviser sent Schoomaker a Power Point presentation saying that ANAM test results were \"misleading\" and that using them could jeopardize the credibility of the military medical establishment. \n \n Faced with the backlash, Schoomaker modified his order, issuing a follow-up that limited the test's use in critical ways. \n \n He decided that soldiers would not have to take the test upon their return to the U.S. from the battlefield, though Congress required post-deployment testing by law. \n \n Schoomaker also ordered that soldiers who scored badly -- or \"red\" in testing lingo -- on their pre-deployment tests would not be referred for follow-up evaluations to see if they had an undiagnosed brain injury. In a written statement to ProPublica and NPR, Schoomaker said soldiers with symptoms were urged to see doctors, but not based on ANAM scores. \"For some people 'red' is their normal score,\" he said of the test. \n \n Several neurologists, in and out of the military, said they considered Schoomaker's order to ignore low baseline scores to be unethical. The Navy and Marines, unlike the Army, refer troops for further attention if they score poorly on their pre-deployment ANAM. \n \n \"It's our obligation as medical providers to our patients to try to figure out if there is something going on that needs to be treated,\" said Navy Commander Jack Tsao, a neurologist who runs the ANAM program for those branches of the service. \n \n Lopez said that by ignoring poor baseline scores, the Army risked sending soldiers with cognitive problems into war. \n \n \"This is horrible and it goes against our medical ethics and moral responsibilities,\" she said. \"They just lock up these results in a box and never look at them before clearing soldiers to deploy.\" \n \n Flaws in Implementation \n \n Despite the many concerns with the ANAM, many experts say the test could have helped detect brain injuries in soldiers if it had been used properly. \n \n Instead, the military has implemented the test in ways that have undercut its value, according to interviews and internal emails obtained by ProPublica and NPR. \n \n One example: Troops take the ANAM just once before deploying, even though some of the test's developers have found that users should take it several times to produce a more accurate baseline score. \n \n Without a reliable baseline, Russell and other specialists said, it's impossible to measure the change in a soldier's cognitive abilities after a blow to the head. In a 2010 report, one military researcher called the testing effort \"fundamentally flawed\" because of the lack of accurate baselines. \n \n More than 1 million soldiers have taken pre-deployment ANAM tests, but medical officials have requested test scores for comparative purposes just 11,000 times since 2008. \n \n Doctors face substantial obstacles in accessing the information. \n \n There's still no computer network that collects and stores test results or integrates them with the military's overall medical system. A doctor in Afghanistan who wants an injured soldier's pre-deployment score has to call into a hotline where an employee creates a PDF with the test results, manually deletes private information such as Social Security numbers, and emails or faxes back the file. \n \n Fewer than 3,000 requests for ANAM test results have been made from the war zones in the last three years, according to recent estimates. Yet more than 90,000 troops suffered traumatic brain injuries during that time, according to the military's official figures. \n \n Reports from the field indicate that the test is not being used consistently when soldiers sustain possible concussions. \n \n This summer, Robert Parish, a neuropsychologist treating troops in Afghanistan, sent an email to colleagues saying the ANAM was more useful than some thought but remained little-used. \n \n \"I have corresponded quite a bit with the ANAM staff recently and discovered, quite to my astonishment, I am currently the only one in any combat theater who is actively using the [ANAM] database in evaluations,\" Parish wrote. \n \n \"Free\" Test Costs a Bundle \n \n When the military chose the ANAM, one of its selling points -- at least, in the eyes of some involved in the decision -- was that it was free. \n \n \"The ANAM, as I understand it, was owned by the Department of Defense. It was developed in conjunction with the Army. So there was no cost to it,\" said Dr. Paul Hammer, director of the Defense Veterans Brain Injury Center. \n \n Lt. Col. Jaffee, who sat on the panel that recommended ANAM, has said in emails and slideshow presentations that ANAM was picked in large part because it was \"the only tool available free of charge to DoD.\" \n \n But even though the ANAM was developed by military researchers, the Defense Department no longer owned the test by the time it went looking for a screening tool. \n \n This was not unusual: To spur innovation, the agency allows government scientists to license their inventions to outside businesses as long as the military shares in the profits. \n \n In February 2006, the lab that employed the ANAM researchers licensed the ANAM to the University of Oklahoma, which would help refine the test at its cognitive research lab. The university then struck a deal with Vista Partners, a contractor based in Colorado, to market the test and handle sales. \n \n So far, the university and Vista have sold the ANAM to a handful of civilian hospitals and researchers, but their biggest customer has been the military. \n \n The Defense Department pays Vista about $2 million a year in user fees for the ANAM, according to contracting documents and interviews. Oklahoma University gets a 12 percent cut of sales, sending a portion back to the military lab that invented the test. The Defense Department also pays the university $1 million a year for making improvements to the test, Russell said. \n \n On top of that, the military has paid Eyak Services, an Alaska-based contractor, $30 million over the last four years to give soldiers the ANAM test. An additional $6.8 million has gone to another contractor, Evolvent, to build an electronic system to collect and distribute test results, though this effort remains incomplete. \n \n The program's total price tag tops $42 million, records show. \n \n Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., who helped author the bill to create the program, is disappointed with the way the money has been spent. \n \n \"This is not adequate,\" said Pascrell in an interview with ProPublica and NPR. \"You're doing harm to these veterans and these wonderful warriors and their families, and we're not going to put up with it. This is not what we paid for.\" \n \n As Problems Emerge, Little Action \n \n Military officials openly acknowledged problems with the TBI testing program at two congressional hearings last year. \n \n In April, Dr. Charles Rice, the president of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, testified to a House Armed Services subcommittee that the ANAM might not accurately reflect soldiers' cognitive abilities. The next day, Schoomaker was even more blunt, telling lawmakers the test was no more accurate than a \"coin flip.\" \n \n Following those hearings, Pascrell and two other congressmen requested a comprehensive report on the program. \n \n In September, Russell delivered a scathing 537-page report that slammed nearly every aspect of the ANAM program. \n \n The report -- which was obtained by ProPublica and NPR, but has never been released publicly -- begins by saying the \"program's history is more troubled than commonly understood.\" \n \n Russell went on to lambaste the manner in which the test was chosen: \"The selection of ANAM was nepotistic, and the long delay in examining alternative instruments is baffling.\" \n \n In the field, Russell said, the test had failed at \"a basic level.\" It was unreliable and soldiers' scores often reflected factors such as fatigue that were unrelated to TBI. \n \n \"This is unacceptable if the ANAM is to be considered a TBI test,\" Russell wrote. \n \n There was one bright spot amid Russell's criticism: Though the ANAM could not diagnose TBI, he said, it could help doctors evaluate when soldiers who had suffered concussions were mentally fit to return to duty. \n \n Overall, however, Russell concluded that the problems with ANAM were so severe that \"it appears that we may be doing our soldiers a disservice with the present baseline program.\" \n \n Pascrell said he was infuriated by Russell's findings. \n \n \"There is no question in my mind that the Department of Defense violated the very essence of the law that we passed\" to require testing, he said. In particular, he said, he was frustrated by the lack of post-deployment testing and the delay in comparing ANAM to other tests. \n \n There are few signs that the changes Pascrell wants are imminent. \n \n When the military initiated the testing program in 2008, it also created a panel of civilian experts to monitor it and other TBI-related issues. \n \n At a meeting in August 2011, the panel discussed whether ANAM should be replaced, expanded, or used routinely post-deployment. Then it endorsed the status quo, partly to preserve the usefulness of data from tests already administered. \n \n The committee's recommendations could be \"expressed in one sentence, which is 'Continue to do what we're doing with the ANAM, but don't do more at this point,'\" said Dr. Kurt Kroenke, the Indiana University professor of medicine who led the discussion. \n \n When S. Ward Casscells, the former head of Pentagon official health affairs, ordered the ANAM into use in May 2008, he depicted it as an interim measure and promised the military would launch a comprehensive study comparing it with other brain-injury tests. \n \n Emails obtained by ProPublica and NPR show the comparison was supposed to be completed by November 2009, but it remains unfinished. \n \n A recent report from the Government Accountability Office said the Defense Department doesn't expect the results until 2015 -- two years after the last troops are scheduled to leave Afghanistan. ||||| Military's Brain-Testing Program A Debacle \n \n The U.S. military has spent more than $42 million to test every service member's brain to find out who suffered a traumatic brain injury, or TBI, during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. But an investigation by NPR and ProPublica has found that military leaders are refusing to carry out the testing program as Congress ordered. Partly as a result, the program that was supposed to fix things has hardly helped any of the troops. \n \n On a recent morning, four dozen soldiers who were about to be deployed to Afghanistan filed into a squat wooden building at Fort Lewis, in Washington state. For the next 20 minutes they would sit at rows of laptop computers clicking through the automated neural psychological assessment metrics computer program known as ANAM. \n \n i toggle caption Joaquin Sapien/ProPublica Joaquin Sapien/ProPublica \n \n Congress ordered the military four years ago to test all service members for cognitive brain functions at least twice \u2014 before they go to war, and again when they return. \n \n \"One of the best ways to tell if something's affecting you is to know how you were before it happened. That's what you do here with ANAM. You'll take ANAM, and it's going to be your baseline,\" says Felix Rios, a contractor with the Office of the Surgeon General who helps administer the test. \n \n Soldiers like Sgt. Michael Persyn say they're glad they've taken this test. \n \n \"It at least gives me a feeling that if ... there is something wrong with me, that they'll be able to know about it,\" he says. \n \n \"I felt more reassured,\" says Benjamin Louis Westman, another soldier taking the test. \n \n But an investigation by NPR and ProPublica has found that these troops have little reason to feel reassured. From interviews with dozens of medical specialists and an analysis of hundreds of pages of military emails and documents, evidence shows that military officials have made poor decisions about the testing program, preventing it from helping many troops who have brain injuries. \n \n \"We have failed. We have failed soldiers,\" says retired Col. Mary Lopez, who used to run the Army's testing program. She still works with soldiers in Germany. \"It is incredibly frustrating because I can see firsthand the soldiers that we've missed, the soldiers that have not been treated, not been identified, misdiagnosed. And then they struggle.\" \n \n Problems Before Testing \n \n The NPR/ProPublica investigation found that the TBI testing program was plagued with problems before it even began. When members of Congress told the military to test all the troops to see how well their brains work, Congress was giving an order that's difficult to carry out. \n \n i toggle caption Becky Lettenberger/NPR Becky Lettenberger/NPR \n \n \"The field is not caught up with Congress' mandate,\" says Alex Dromerick, who co-directs the Brain Research Center at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, in Washington, D.C. \"Congress wants something that takes many years and a lot of research effort to develop.\" \n \n \n \n He also says a doctor with special training is needed to diagnose a TBI. A computer test can show you that someone's brain isn't working well, but there's no test on the market that can show why. \n \n \"The test to meet Congress' specifications does not exist yet,\" Dromerick says. \n \n However, he and other brain specialists say, a good computer test can help doctors by providing a warning light if someone flunks the test. That could signal someone might be suffering from a brain injury and needs a medical evaluation. \n \n Hockey League May Have Better Solution \n \n \n \n Another problem with the program is that top military officials did not choose a very good test, according to the Pentagon's own medical advisers. They say the National Hockey League, whose players are constantly hitting the glass \u2014 and each other \u2014 has a better test to help spot brain injuries than does the U.S. military. \n \n Key Findings Of This Investigation An investigation by NPR and ProPublica has found that the ANAM testing program used by the military to identify soldiers with traumatic brain injuries has failed to deliver on its promise, offering soldiers the appearance of help, but not the reality. Four years later, more than 1 million troops have taken the test at a cost of more than $42 million to taxpayers, yet the military still has no reliable way to catch brain injuries in soldiers. When such injuries are left undetected, it can delay healing and put soldiers at risk for further mental damage. Based on corporate and government records, confidential documents, scores of interviews, and emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, the investigation found: * The people who invented ANAM and stood to make money from it were involved in the military's decision to use it. No other tests received serious consideration. A report by the Army's top neuropsychologist circulated last year labeled the selection process \"nepotistic.\" * The Pentagon's civilian leadership has ignored years of warnings that there was insufficient scientific evidence that the ANAM could screen or diagnose TBI. The military's highest-ranking medical official said the test was \"fraught with problems.\" * Compounding flaws in the ANAM's design, the military has not administered the test as recommended and has rarely used its results. The Army has so little confidence in the test that its top medical officer issued an explicit order that soldiers whose scores indicated cognitive problems should not be sent for further medical evaluation. * Top Pentagon officials have misrepresented the cost of the test, indicating that because the Army invented ANAM, the military could use it for free. In fact, because the military licensed its invention to outside contractors, it has paid millions of dollars to use its own technology. Read more on ProPublica's website > UPDATE: Congressman Slams Military Testing Prorgram ProPublica: Brain Wars Series \n \n \"We find that the testing program is very useful for our athletes,\" says Ruben Echemendia, a chief neurologist for the NHL. \n \n There are various computer brain tests on the market, just like there are different kits to test blood pressure, so to pick the best one, Echemendia assembled a Concussion Working Group with doctors, players' representatives and others. \n \n \"All of the research in their tests, all of the peer-reviewed publications that they had, including the reliability and validity data with the tests, and it was fairly clear to us which program we wanted to use in our testing program,\" he says. \n \n ANAM was not that test. Instead, the NHL chose one called ImPact. \n \n According to Echemendia, the test can pinpoint problems in thinking, concentrating or reacting in about 30 percent of the players who say, \"No problem, I feel fine,\" after slamming their heads. \n \n \"Had we not been using these tests we may be returning these players back to play prematurely,\" he says. \n \n But sources in the military say that they didn't do any rigorous comparisons when choosing which test to administer. Instead, Pentagon officials were determined to use ANAM, which was developed by military researchers, despite concerns by their medical advisers. \n \n \"The scientific advisory panel did not to the best of my recollection at any one time say the ANAM is the choice, is the instrument that should be used,\" says Morgan Sammons, dean of psychology at Alliant University in California, who was one of those advisers. \n \n The advisers warned there weren't many good studies on the test and that it's too sensitive. Test-takers who didn't sleep much or were distracted could get low scores, which might mistakenly lead doctors to treat them for brain injuries. \n \n \"ANAM will never be a good population screening tool. It just doesn't have the ability to detect a concussion weeks or months out from the event itself,\" says Michael Russell, a neuropsychologist, who currently runs the Army's ANAM program. \"If they had said, 'Would you like to use something else?' I probably would have said, 'Yes, I'd like to use something else.' \" \n \n Doctors with the Special Forces insisted on using something else. They chose the same test that hockey players use. \n \n Ward Casscells, who despite some advisers' concerns made the decision to use ANAM when he was assistant secretary of defense, says he can't remember the details of the debate. \n \n \"I think we reached an agreement on it that half a loaf was better than none, and we would watch this test closely to see how it could be improved,\" he says. \n \n A Third Problem \n \n Despite the test's flaws, studies show ANAM can help spot troops with brain injuries if military officials use it correctly. Top Pentagon officials ordered the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marines to give ANAM to all their troops. But this led to a third problem: Many officials refuse \u2014 especially in the Army. \n \n Consider this scenario: A Marine is about to deploy to Afghanistan and takes the ANAM to get a baseline score. The results are terrible \u2014 showing poor reaction time and awful memory. \n \n Document On page 11 of this report obtained by NPR and ProPublica, it notes: Baseline ANAM testing will not be used to generate medical referrals. Information Paper: ANAM Program Use \n \n Jack Tsao, a Navy commander and neurologist who runs the traumatic brain injury programs for the Navy and Marines, says the answer for those services is easy: \"Yes, if there's an abnormality we need to follow it up.\" \n \n He says it's possible that the Marine might just be tired, which could contribute to a low score. But it's also possible the Marine has brain damage from a previous deployment, which nobody has diagnosed. So the Navy issued an order that Marines or sailors who test poorly must be sent to a doctor for a follow-up. \n \n \"Our obligation as medical providers to our patients who are service members is that we try to figure out if there is something going on, that needs to be treated,\" Tsao says. \"We want to ensure that we are taking care of our service members' health needs.\" \n \n But Lt. Gen. Eric Schoomaker, who runs the Army's medical system, issued a written order in November 2008 that said Army troops who score low on the ANAM test \"will not\" be referred for a follow-up medical evaluation. \n \n i toggle caption Mike Kane for NPR Mike Kane for NPR \n \n One top military doctor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she was afraid she would get in trouble if she used her name, calls Schoomaker's policy \"unethical.\" Lopez, who used to run the Army's testing program, says the order hurts the troops. \n \n \"The ANAM testers themselves will come back and say: 'I have a soldier right in front of me who says, \"I was in a blast. I'm still having headaches. My memory is short.\" And I'm really concerned about this person's performance on this test,' \" says Lopez. \"And we can't tell the primary care provider.\" \n \n In a written statement, Schoomaker told NPR and ProPublica, \"Of course, if the Soldier has any symptoms or problems with their health, they are encouraged to document this and discuss it\" with a health care provider. \n \n Sources who have worked with Schoomaker told NPR and ProPublica that Schoomaker has banned follow-up evaluations based on ANAM partly because the Army has a shortage of trained medical staff. \n \n \"Certainly our large medical centers are very well-staffed with good professionals. Where soldiers mobilize is often much more austere environments,\" acknowleges Russell. \"There aren't a lot of professionals ... nearby who could quickly evaluate those people.\" \n \n Sources also said that Schoomaker and other commanders worry that if troops who score low on ANAM are referred for medical evaluations, it could postpone their deployments. \n \n 'This Is Not What We Paid For' \n \n Since Congress ordered the Pentagon to test all the troops almost four years ago, the military has done half of what Congress asked \u2014 it has given the ANAM to 1 million people before they deploy. But the military has tested only a tiny fraction of the troops since they've come home. Roughly 1 million baseline tests are sitting in a file without a follow-up. \n \n Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., one of the key legislators who persuaded Congress to pass the law that ordered the Pentagon to test the troops, says this is not what Congress asked for. \n \n \"The Army seems to be fighting us on this.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A military brain-injury testing program has cost $42 million thus far\u2014but hardly any soldiers have benefited from the plan, according to a joint investigation by NPR and ProPublica. Their reports suggest the program has a been a huge waste of money that has fallen way short of its primary mission\u2014diagnosing brain injuries among the troops. \u201cWe have failed soldiers,\u201d says a retired colonel who used to run the program. \u201cI can see firsthand the soldiers that we've missed, the soldiers that have not been treated, not been identified, misdiagnosed. And then they struggle.\u201d Congress in 2007 called on the military to test troops\u2019 brain function before and after deployment to help fight the rising number of traumatic brain injuries. One big problem: The test ultimately chosen isn\u2019t the best one available for the job, insiders say. What's more, the people who invented the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric and stood to gain financially from its use were involved in the military's decision to employ it.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 In 2007, with roadside bombs exploding across Iraq, Congress moved to improve care for soldiers who had suffered one of the war's signature wounds, traumatic brain injury. Lawmakers passed a measure requiring the military to test soldiers' brain function before they deployed and again when they returned. The test was supposed to ensure that soldiers received proper treatment. Instead, an investigation by ProPublica and NPR has found, the testing program has failed to deliver on its promise, offering soldiers the appearance of help, but not the reality. Racing to satisfy Congress' mandate, the military chose a test that wasn't actually proven to detect TBI: the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metric, or ANAM. Four years later, more than a million troops have taken the test at a cost of more than $42 million to taxpayers, yet the military still has no reliable way to catch brain injuries. Based on corporate and government records, confidential documents, scores of interviews and emails obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, our investigation found: The people who invented ANAM and stood to make money from it were involved in the military's decision to use it, prompting questions about the impartiality of the selection process. A report by the Army's top neuropsychologist circulated last year to key members of Congress labeled the selection process \"nepotistic.\" The military has so little confidence in the test that its top medical officer issued an explicit order that soldiers whose scores indicated cognitive problems should not be sent for further medical evaluation.",

And starting on Jan. 13th, Apple will do just that. \n \n The company said Wednesday that China will be among 22 countries that soon will get the newest iPhone, one of Apple's hottest-selling yet. The iPhone now accounts for nearly half of Apple's annual revenue, and some analysts believe it earns the company more than 60% of its profits. \n \n China is one of the world's largest mobile device markets, with close to a billion cellphone users by some estimates. Apple currently partners with China Unicom, one of the larger carriers with close to 200 million cellular subscribers. \n \n Apple said Wednesday it had no current plans to announce a partnership with China Mobile, the country's largest carrier with more than 630 million subscribers (a user base that, somewhat amazingly, is more than twice the size of the U.S. population). But for months now Apple has been rumored to be nailing down a deal with China Mobile, and millions of the carriers' customers are already using the iPhone by modifying the device to work on their network. \n \n Will Siri actually be able to speak and understand Mandarin?

Apple today stuck to its previous commitment to bring Mandarin comprehension to Siri some time this year. \n \n China Unicom, the only Apple-sanctioned carrier on the mainland, will start selling the iPhone 4S on Jan. 13 as well. \n \n Talk of other Chinese mobile carriers, including the country's largest, China Mobile, remain just that for now. \"We expect China Telecom to be added this year and we believe China Mobile will eventually become part of the Apple ecosystem,\" White said today. \n \n Based on the quick sell-out of the iPhone 4S in Hong Kong -- supplies were exhausted within minutes at its one Apple store on launch day -- White also anticipates a run on the iPhone 4S in the PRC. \"We believe the demand for the iPhone 4S in Mainland China to be unprecedented,\" White said. \n \n China has increasingly been a major factor in Apple's massive revenues. In the quarter that ended Sept. 30, 2011, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong generated 16% of the company's total income. \n \n And China, White reminded clients today, is the largest smartphone market in the world. \n \n \"The total mobile phone subscriber base in China was 963.7 million in November, and [the] high-end mobile phone market in China is estimated at 100-125 million subscribers or ~$70 billion,\" said White. \n \n Apple has not revealed prices for the iPhone 4S in China, but most experts believe it will carry the same tag as the iPhone 4 did in 2010: 4,999 yuan ($793) for the 16GB model and 5,999 yuan ($952) for the 32GB model. Those prices are sans a long-term carrier contract. \n \n The 8GB iPhone 4, which sells for $99 in the U.S. with a two-year contract, goes for 3,880 yuan ($633) in China without a contract. \n \n More than 20 other countries -- including Bolivia, Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Senegal -- will also see the iPhone 4S selling on Jan. 13. \n \n Gregg Keizer covers Microsoft, security issues, Apple, Web browsers and general technology breaking news for Computerworld.

Images from the dig, showing almost perfectly preserved medieval skeletons unearthed after centuries of burial, are also being released for the first time today. \n \n The report reveals that the complete skeletal remains of over 400 medieval burials were uncovered by a team from the Cambridge Archaeological Unit, along with \u201cdisarticulated\u201d and fragmentary remains of what could be as many as 1,000 more individuals. \n \n While the existence and location of the cemetery have been known to historians since at least the mid-twentieth century, the sheer scale and extent of the burial ground was unclear until now. \n \n The bodies, which mostly date from a period spanning the 13th to 15th centuries, are burials from the medieval Hospital of St John the Evangelist which stood opposite the graveyard until 1511, and from which St John\u2019s College takes its name. The number of remains discovered was far more than the team had expected, and they shed significant new light on life and death in medieval Cambridge. Craig Cessford of the Cambridge University Department of Archaeology and Anthropology led the dig and authored the report. He said the Old Divinity School excavation was \u201cone of the largest medieval hospital osteoarcheological assemblages from the British Isles\u201d. \n \n The site of the Old Divinity School, built in 1877-1879, was formerly the burial ground of the Hospital, instituted around 1195 by the townspeople of Cambridge to care for the poor and sick in the community. Originally merely a small building on a patch of waste ground, the Hospital grew with Church support to be a noted place of hospitality and care for both University scholars and local people. \n \n Despite local rumours linking the Hospital cemetery to the Black Death, no evidence of this disease was found on any of the remains, nor did the team find any sign of large burial groups from that period (1348-1350). In later centuries, plague victims in Cambridge were buried on local grazing land such as Midsummer Common, and it is likely that the same locations were used in the medieval period as well. \n \n The Hospital cemetery, dating from the early 13th century, contained the bodies of approximately 1,300 people, most of which were buried in neatly laid-out rows, or deposited in a charnel house on the site. The team, from the Cambridge Archaeological Unit, found the cemetery to have six \u201ccemetery generations\u201d, defined as the time taken to fill all available space before burying other bodies in the same locations. \n \n The cemetery was found to have had gravel paths and a water well, along with seeds from various flowering plants, suggesting that much like today\u2019s cemeteries, it was a place for people to come and visit their deceased loved ones. \n \n Of the various human remains excavated by the team, 400 individuals were closely analysed to discover clues as to the nature of the cemetery and the surrounding community. The vast majority of burials took place without coffins, many even without shrouds, suggesting the cemetery was primarily used to serve the poor. Grave-goods such as jewellery and personal items were only present in a handful of burials. \n \n \u201cEvidence for clothing and grave-goods is rarer than at most hospital cemeteries\u201d, said Dr Cessford, \u201cprincipally because this was a purely lay graveyard with no clerics present. Items were found in graves that might represent grave-goods, but their positions were ambiguous and it is equally possible that they represent residual material from earlier activity at the site\u201d. \n \n Also of interest to the archaeologists was the relative lack of remains of young women and complete absence of infants, which would normally be expected in a medieval hospital cemetery. Of the remains that could be identified, there seems to have been a roughly equal gender balance, with the majority of individuals having died between around 25 and 45 years old. The lack of young female remains can probably be explained by the Hospital\u2019s Augustinian ordinance from 1250 which established its areas of concern to be \u201cpoor scholars and other wretched persons\u201d, and specifically excluded pregnant women from its care. \n \n The bodies surprisingly did not exhibit many serious illnesses and conditions that would have required medical attention. The Archaeological Journal report suggests that \u201cthis could reflect that the main role of the Hospital was spiritual and physical care of the poor and infirm rather than medical treatment of the sick and injured\u201d. \n \n The full report has been published in the latest issue of the Archaeological Journal, number 172.",

The numbers make it one of Britain's largest medieval cemeteries, reports the Guardian. Most of the people were buried between the 13th and 15th centuries, when the cemetery was in operation near the ancient Hospital of St. John the Evangelist. Most were buried without coffins or shrouds, suggesting they were poor, notes the Telegraph. Unusual for cemeteries of this era was the lack of infants and young women, likely because the nearby hospital did not treat pregnant women and instead focused on \"poor scholars and other wretched persons,\" reports the University of Cambridge. Archaeologists also found evidence of gravel paths, seeds, and a water well, meaning that the cemetery seemed to be a place where loved ones would visit and pay their respects.

The graveyard, which dates from the 13th to 15th centuries and was previously known to historians, contained about 1,300 burials, including 400 complete skeletons, reports the Telegraph. It was so big that some graves had been pre-dug in anticipation of winter deaths. \"This suggests that some, but not all of the graves may have been dug in advance of being needed,\" says the report in the Archaeological Journal. \"One possibility is that this occurred prior to the winter, when ground conditions would have potentially made digging graves considerably more difficult.\" The Hospital of St. John the Evangelist, which stood opposite the graveyard until 1511, was a place of hospitality and care for the poor, and the vast majority of burials were without coffins. Grave-goods such as jewelry and personal items were only present in a handful of burials but they included a jet crucifix and the head of a woman. \"Evidence for clothing and grave-goods is rarer than at most hospital cemeteries,\" says the lead researcher. \"This is principally because this was a purely lay graveyard with no clerics present. Items were found in graves that might represent grave-goods, but their positions were ambiguous and it is equally possible that they represent residual material from earlier activity at the site.\"",

Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) before the November elections. \n \n In an unusual break from the bipartisan secrecy the panel normally maintains, Rep. Jo Bonner (Ala.), the ranking Republican on the ethics committee, issued a public statement accusing Democrats of \u201cstalling\u201d the resolution of the Rangel and Waters matters. \n \n \u201cIt is in the best interest of transparency and fairness to the American people, Representatives Charlie Rangel and Maxine Waters, and other members of the U.S. House of Representatives, that the House ethics committee stop stalling the resolution of the Rangel and Waters matters and complete these public trails prior to the November elections,\u201d Bonner said in a lengthy written statement signed by himself and the four other GOP members of the ethics panel. \n \n The ethics committee has been struggling to set a date for the public trials. Last Thursday the committee huddled in its basement office to try to hash out an agreement on the scheduling, but Republicans and Democrats were still at an impasse as of late last week. \n \n Democratic leaders would no doubt like to avoid the spectacle of back-to-back public ethics trials for two of their members before the November elections. They have been frustrated with Rangel and Waters ever since they both rejected attempts to negotiate punishments and avoid a public trial. \n \n Republicans, who stand to gain seats in the November election and possibly retake the majority, have every interest in showcasing the ethics charges against two prominent Democrats. Rangel, too, said he would like to have a chance to clear his name before the midterm vote and has expressed frustration over the ethics committee\u2019s failure to produce a trial schedule. \n \n Waters has urged the panel to hold the trial before the election, but last week said only that she would comment at the appropriate time. \n \n Watchdogs are expecting those trials to take place after the elections so the ethics committee can avoid any accusations of politicizing the process. \n \n In his public statement, Bonner specifically took issue with comments House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) made this past weekend. Bonner blasted Hoyer for inaccurately saying that the scheduling of the trials is \u201cup to Jo Bonner, and Zoe Lofgren, the Democrat.\u201d \n \n Hoyer also called for the trials to \u201cbe resolved as quickly as possible\u201d and attributed the unwillingness of the committee to set trial dates prior to the November election to \u201ctheir own scheduling problems.\u201d \n \n Bonner pointed to committee rules allowing adjudicatory subcommittees to meet \u201cat the discretion of the chair.\u201d \n \n \u201cAfter months of trial preparation \u2014 and, in the Rangel matter, two years of investigation \u2014 Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren should have already issued notices of public trial schedules in both the Rangel and Waters matters,\u201d Bonner said in the statement. \n \n He also said that members of the committee have \u201crepeatedly\u201d expressed their willingness to meet in October and hold the trial and noted that in the past committee members have returned to Washington to conclude \u201cpressing\u201d ethics issues. \n \n \u201cRepresentative Rangel and Representative Waters have publicly and rightfully \u2014 demanded the setting of their respective trials prior to the November election to ensure swift and fair resolution of their matters,\u201d Bonner wrote. \u201cIn our opinion, Representatives Rangel and Waters deserve the opportunity to publicly and timely address the charges against them.\u201d \n \n \n \n",

    "document": "The $43,000 phone booth that then-EPA administrator Scott Pruitt installed in his office may not have been worth all the headaches it caused him. \n \n He placed only one phone call to the White House, newly released records from the agency show. It lasted five minutes. \n \n The head of the Environmental Protection Agency resigned last month after coming under fire for how he spent tax dollars and treated his staff. He made the five-minute call on Jan. 29, according to Verizon phone logs released in response to litigation filed by the Sierra Club, an environmental advocacy group. \n \n [Scott Pruitt\u2019s $25,000 soundproof phone booth? It actually cost more like $43,000.] \n \n The new documents do not show how many incoming calls Pruitt received in the soundproof booth, which he installed last year. In April, Pruitt testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee that he used the booth sparingly. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s for confidential communications, and it\u2019s rare,\u201d he told Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.). \n \n \n \n Then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt at the White House in June. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n \n Previously Pruitt had likened the booth to a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF), which government officials use to conduct secure conversations, arguing that he needed it to discuss matters with the White House. The EPA has a SCIF at its headquarters on a different floor from the administrator\u2019s office. \n \n \u201cCabinet-level officials need to have access to secure communications,\u201d the then-administrator testified in December. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary for me to be able to do my job.\u201d \n \n EPA officials said Monday that they could not specify how many incoming calls Pruitt received from the White House in the soundproof booth. \n \n \u201cEPA has learned from Verizon that in order to request complete phone logs of all incoming and outgoing calls to or from these lines, EPA would need to supply Verizon with a subpoena for the records,\u201d said EPA spokesman James Hewitt, who declined to say what the call was about. \n \n The agency identified two phone lines associated with the booth, according to correspondence between EPA attorneys and Sierra Club lawyers. The phone numbers released through billing records for November involve calls technicians made to test the lines, EPA lawyers said. \n \n The EPA voluntarily provided billing records for the booth through June 20, just two weeks before Pruitt resigned his post, that show no other outgoing calls from the booth. The Sierra Club\u2019s original public-records request covered the period ending Dec. 6. \n \n The Government Accountability Office concluded that Pruitt violated federal spending laws when he built the phone booth, because he spent more than $5,000 without providing advance notice to Congress. \n \n While the original contract for the phone booth was slated to cost roughly $25,000, the agency ended up paying contractors an additional $18,000 to convert a closet space that could house it. That work included removing closed-circuit television equipment, pouring 55 square feet of concrete, installing a drop ceiling and patching and painting the room. \n \n Pruitt told members of the Energy Committee in April that he did not know the project\u2019s price tag had escalated to $43,000. \u201cI was not aware of the approval of the $43,000, and if I had known about it . . . I would not have approved it,\u201d he said. \n \n A few hours later, Pruitt remarked to members of a House Appropriations subcommittee that in retrospect, the decision to install the booth \u201cshould not have been made.\u201d \n \n Melinda Pierce, legislative director for the Sierra Club, said in a statement that the incident underscored the kind of managers President Trump has picked to run the federal government. \n \n \u201cWith each new revelation it becomes clearer and clearer that Donald Trump enabled the most corrupt cabinet member ever to hang on far past his expiration date,\u201d Pierce said, adding that Pruitt\u2019s successor continues to advance policies that benefit corporate interests. \u201cWe need leadership at the EPA that can be trusted to protect our health, not polluter profits.\u201d \n \n Shortly after taking the helm of the EPA, acting administrator Andrew Wheeler indicated in an interview with E&E News that he does not intend to dismantle the phone booth. He added that he would maintain a policy Pruitt instituted in the spring that requires that at least two senior EPA officials beyond the administrator sign off on any expense over $5,000. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s there,\u201d Wheeler said of the booth. \u201cIt would be expensive to tear it apart. I don\u2019t see any sense in tearing it apart. And in this day and age, I don\u2019t know what the assessment was for the need of it.\u201d \n \n Read more \n \n Pruitt\u2019s $25,000 phone booth cost more like $43,000, records show \n \n Pruitt blames aides and staff for spending missteps at EPA \n \n Scott Pruitt resigns amid ethics, management scandals ||||| THE LIGHTBULB \n \n Acting Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler listens as President Trump leads a cabinet meeting in the White House this month. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post) \n \n Investigators in Congress and reporters played a role in unearthing information about Scott Pruitt\u2019s suspect spending decisions. But much of the credit for exposing the activities of the former Environmental Protection Agency chief goes to the Sierra Club. \n \n Now the group is making its move against his successor, acting administrator Andrew Wheeler. \n \n The nation\u2019s oldest environmental advocacy group overwhelmed the agency with requests for emails and other documents sent by Pruitt and his closest aides. When the EPA failed to cough up the correspondence requested under the Freedom of Information Act, the Sierra Club sued. By April, the lawsuit yielded a trove of documents used by reporters, including those at The Washington Post, to share with the public details of his behavior in office that sparked a firestorm of criticism. \n \n This week the Sierra Club filed an amendment to a lawsuit against the EPA in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, asking the agency to release yet more communications from EPA staff \u2014 including those, for the first time, from Wheeler. \n \n \u201cWith these FOIAs, we're keeping an eye on their external communication, which will allow us to see how they're getting information, how they're making decisions,\u201d Sierra Club senior attorney Elena Saxonhouse said. \u201cThat was the same approach that we took with the Pruitt FOIA, and it's really the same strategy here.\u201d \n \n The organization is not letting up after its past FOIA requests yielded documents that helped whittle down President Trump\u2019s support for Pruitt -- even though the former EPA chief was lauded by conservatives for reducing regulatory burdens for businesses. \n \n For example, one of the more unusual emails unearthed by the Sierra Club was a request from Pruitt's scheduler to Dan Cathy, the chief executive of Chick-fil-A. The aide asked Cathy whether he would meet with Pruitt to discuss \u201ca potential business opportunity.\u201d The fast-food company eventually confirmed to The Post that Pruitt told a Chick-fil-A representative over the phone that he wanted his wife to become a franchisee. \n \n Another exchange revealed the agency spent $1,560 on a dozen customized fountain pens emblazoned the Pruitt's signature. \n \n Of course, the Sierra Club did not originally file its public-records requests on Pruitt with fancy pens or fried chicken in mind. \u201cHe had many ties to polluting industries,\u201d said Saxonhouse, who was recently profiled in Slate for overseeing the Sierra Club's FOIA efforts. \n \n \u201cThere is still a lot of people at EPA there to carry out the agenda of granting industry wish lists,\u201d she added. \n \n In total, the Sierra Club is seeking the records of 25 more staffers with its suit in San Francisco. The agency did not reply to a request for comment from The Post. \n \n Environmentalists see a similar pro-industry streak in Wheeler. After working for years for Sen. James M. Inhofe (R-Okla.), one of the most ardent opponents of climate science in the Senate, Wheeler went on to lobby for several industries, including coal and nuclear companies, before joining the Trump campaign as an energy adviser. \n \n Programming note: I am off next week, but the Energy 202 is not. Several of my colleagues will be filling in for me during my vacation. \n \n POWER PLAYS \n \n Environmental Protection Agency Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) \n \n \u2014 More on Wheeler: The acting administrator pledged upon taking office that he would avoid potential conflicts of interest. But E&E News reports that since taking over as acting chief of the agency, Wheeler has taken three meetings with former clients that \u201cmay have violated the Trump administration\u2019s ethics pledge,\u201d and attended events that included the head of a company that Wheeler agreed not to meet with through 2020. The meetings, which E&E News reports are mentioned on Wheeler\u2019s public schedule, \u201cstand in stark contrast to the acting EPA chief's claims that he is taking pains to avoid helping his former clients advance their interests,\u201d per the report. \u201cIt's possible that the meetings with former clients weren't about a 'particular matter' that Wheeler previously worked on for them. But that's difficult to determine from the public calendars, and EPA didn't provide additional information about the focus of the events.\u201d \n \n Vehicles sit in rush hour traffic at the interchange between the Interstate 405 and 10 freeways in Los Angeles, California. (Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg) \n \n \u2014 EPA rolls forward with some Pruitt deregulation... The Trump administration is set to halt Obama-era fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks, Wheeler told USA Today, adding that the previous administration \u201cjumped the gun\u201d on increasing fuel-economy standards. The Obama-era agreement was to boost fuel-economy levels to an average of 34.5 mpg by 2016 and increase it yearly up to 54.5 mpg by the end of 2025, per the report. \n \n ...and reverses it elsewhere: In a 180, the EPA said Thursday it would enforce stricter pollution limits on \u201cglider trucks,\u201d which The Post\u2019s Juliet Eilperin and Brady Dennis report emit dozens of times more soot and contaminants than diesel engine trucks. The move reverses ex-administrator Pruitt\u2019s final act as the head of the agency. In a three-page memo, Wheeler said he would withdraw Pruitt\u2019s \u201cno action assurance\u201d to manufacturers of glider trucks that said they would not have to limit their production to 300 trucks through the end of 2019. \u201cIn his memo Wheeler noted that the agency suspends enforcement only in rare circumstances and that after consulting with EPA lawyers and policy experts, 'I have concluded that the application of the current regulations to the glider industry does not represent the kind of extremely unusual circumstances that support the EPA\u2019s use of enforcement discretion,\u2019\u201d per Eilperin and Dennis. \n \n Former Republican Senate candidate and former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship.

Just then the shark struck. \n \n \u201cIt felt like something very heavy had a very hard grip on my leg,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t feel pain from the lacerations. I\u2019m not quite sure it pulled me under. Some people said they saw my head go under. I don\u2019t remember that.\u201d \n \n Myers said the shark grabbed his left foot, and he kicked with his free right foot at what he believes was the creature\u2019s snout. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of lacerations on my right foot where I kicked at it, and I imagine I kicked its teeth and it let me go,\u201d he said. \u201cI imagine it must have been the snout I was kicking.\u201d \n \n Earlier this week state officials labeled the attack the work of a great white shark, a conclusion Myers agrees with. The state has been tracking at least nine of the big sharks off the coast of Cape Cod but had not seen any as far north as Truro, where the attack took place. \n \n State environmental officials said yesterday they are still investigating the attack. Myers, who suffered serious injuries to his lower legs and will require physical therapy to fully recover, said he wishes shark warnings had been posted. \n \n \u201cI have deep puncture wounds on both of my legs that required stitches. I had 47 stitches,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a couple of severed tendons in my left ankle and so I\u2019m feeling very pleased to be here and walking.\u201d \n \n After the attack, the shark surfaced between him and his son, he said. \n \n \u201cI felt like however fast I wanted to swim it was up to the shark if he was going to get me or not,\u201d J.J. Myers said, \u201cbecause whether you can swim fast or not, the shark is going to swim faster.\u201d \n \n His father worried he wouldn\u2019t make the 400 yards to shore.\u201cAbout half way there I started to feel dizzy and light-headed, and I was wondering if I was losing blood.\u201d \n \n Myers is thankful for all who came to his aid. As for the shark, he\u2019s not holding a grudge. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ll be biting into a nice steak tonight and probably not thinking too hard about it,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I can\u2019t get too mad at the shark either.\u201d ||||| Last Monday\u2019s shark attack off Truro\u2019s Ballston Beach \u2013 the first in 76 years on Cape Cod \u2013 set off a media furor and horrified beachgoers along the storied Massachusetts peninsula that attracts millions of vacationers every summer. \n \n It may also force the hordes that crowd the Cape\u2019s beaches to relearn a lesson lost for decades when seals had all but disappeared from the New England coasts \u2013 that swimming among shark\u2019s prey is very dangerous. \n \n Lifeguards were on high alert, hundreds of spurious dorsal fin sightings were reported and airborne spotters scanned the offshore swells for great white sharks, the prime suspect in the attack on Chris Myers, 50. \n \n More than 300,000 grey seals, and their vulnerable pups, now live on the Cape \u2013 a population 30 times the nadir in the 1960s \u2013 and the return of the seals has attracted a return, inshore, of great white sharks. \n \n \u201cThe reason the great white sharks are coming closer to shore in the Cape Cod area, specifically on the eastern shore, is because of the growing grey seal population,\u201d said Greg Skomal, a Massachusetts marine biologist. \n \n Mr. Myers and his 16-year-old son were swimming several hundred metres offshore, close to known seal colonies, when something bit his lower legs. \n \n Meanwhile harried Massachusetts tourism officials were battling to prevent a single attack morphing into a nightmare marketing scenario of sinister fins slicing the waters off Cape Cod. \n \n \u201cNot to downplay the nasty experience the bitee has had but there are sharks in the ocean,\u201d said Betsy Wall, executive director of the Massachusetts Office of Travel and Tourism. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of signs and notices about where it is safe to swim and where it is not. People should stay away from seals.\u201d \n \n Mr. Myers, 50, who is expected to make a full recovery from deep gashes that required more than 40 stitches to close, apparently got the message. \n \n \u201cMaybe people need to be a little more careful than I was,\u201d he told Good Morning America, his lower legs still heavily bandaged. \u201cDon\u2019t be an easy meal.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s the summer news doldrums and nothing tops a shark attack for media excitement,\u201d said George Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research who also maintains the International Shark Attack File at the University of Florida. \u201cIt\u2019s a hot-button issue and not just because of the movie Jaws,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cWhen humans disregard the rules \u2026 such as going in the water with seals in the area,\u201d there will be attacks, he said. \n \n Great whites, while hardly the ferocious, man-eating terrors depicted in Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1975 horror-thriller Jaws, are dangerous and have been sighted with greater frequency in recent years off Cape Cod as seal populations have re-established themselves. \n \n Seals, along with sea birds, fish and dolphins are routinely eaten by the great white, which can exceed five metres in length and weigh more than two tonnes. \n \n Seal-hunting sharks like to lurk just offshore to attack as the seals leave or return to the beach, especially where the bottom drops off suddenly, Mr. Burgess said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea to swim there.\u201d \n \n Shark attacks on humans are statistically rare; fatal attacks vanishingly so. In 2011, a typical year, just roughly 120 attacks were verified worldwide, of which only 17 were fatal. By comparison, an estimated 100 people die every year from jellyfish stings. The last, and unconfirmed, fatal shark attack in Canada was off Nova Scotia in August, 1891. \n \n \u201cBut ultimately, the sharks are in their realm, \u2026 we are the intruders,\u201d said Rob Mottice, a shark expert and marine biologist at the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, Tenn. \u201cThere will always be a handful of attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cSharks attack because they mistake humans for something else. Whatever we do won\u2019t change that.\u201d",

More than 300,000 grey seals now live in the area\u201430 times more than in the '60s\u2014and their presence has attracted plenty of great whites, notes the Globe and Mail. The seal-hunting sharks lurk offshore as seals leave or return to beaches, making the area where the bottom drops off a very bad place to swim if you don't want to be mistaken for a seal by a hungry shark, experts say. Tourism officials hope the attack won't be too bad for business. \"Not to downplay the nasty experience the bitee has had, but there are sharks in the ocean,\" the director of the state's tourism office says. \"There\u2019s a lot of signs and notices about where it is safe to swim and where it is not.

Police believe she left her four kids, all under five years old, home alone Monday night. That's when little J'Zyra, seen on Thompson's Facebook page with big eyes and a bright smile, ended up in the oven. The toddler burned to death with three other kids in the home. She died without ever knowing a father.\"She was a cute little baby, I just didn't know if that was my daughter or not,\" said Price, who has never taken a paternity test relating to her ex-girlfriend's youngest child.Court records obtained by Eyewitness News show Child Protective Services are concerned with a number of issues relating to Thompson and her boyfriend. Records show Thompson told officials she often left the kids home alone to drive her boyfriend to work at a pizza place. Monday night, Thompson and her boyfriend left to go get Dominos Pizza for takeout, and stopped at Walgreens to pick up a prescription. Case workers say the couple left the four kids home alone without telling a grandmother who lived in the same apartment complex.\"It's very irresponsible, someone should have been here or I should have gotten a phone call, come and get my children.\" Price says his two children had been staying with Thompson because he lost his job a few months ago. He says he has since tried to contact Thompson on the phone and via Facebook, but she has not responded.Court records show prices two kids, just three years old, told investigators that one of them put the baby in the oven, and the other turned it on. Records show the children told CPS workers they made the oven \"hot\", and that the baby was kicking the oven door while inside. Records also show Thompson tried CPR when she got home. But it was too late, the child had multiple burns.CPS said no suitable relatives can care for the three surviving children from the home, so they are currently in foster care.

The Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement also denied lease extension requests from two companies, Shell and Statoil, that were exploring the seas for fossil fuels. \n \n The decisions to nix the lease sales, which the statement attributed to \"current market conditions and low industry interest,\" follows Shell's announcement that it will stop exploration in the Chukchi Sea for \"the foreseeable future.\" \n \n \"In light of Shell's announcement, the amount of acreage already under lease and current market conditions, it does not make sense to prepare for lease sales in the Arctic in the next year and a half,\" said Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell. \n \n Lois Epstein, an engineer for the environmental group The Wilderness Society, characterized the government's decision as reasonable, according to a statement. \n \n \"Because of Shell's failure to find significant oil in the Chukchi Sea, new Arctic Ocean lease sales \u2014 which require extensive government preparation and costs \u2014 would likely be unsuccessful,\" Epstein said. \n \n In explaining why Shell and Statoil were not given permission to retain their leases beyond 10 years, the Interior Department statement said that the companies \"did not demonstrate a reasonable schedule of work for exploration and development.\" \n \n Epstein praised the move, saying, \"We applaud Interior's decision not to continue discussing extensions of their existing leases with Shell and other Arctic Ocean leaseholders.\" \n \n The existing leases in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas will expire in 2017 and 2020, respectively. ||||| Image copyright AP Image caption Shell had leased rigs for the Arctic but said it did not find sufficient amounts of oil and gas \n \n The US government has announced new curbs on oil and gas exploration in Arctic waters off Alaska's northern coast. \n \n It comes after oil giant Royal Dutch Shell last month stopped its Arctic activity citing \"disappointing\" tests. \n \n The US interior department said it was cancelling two potential Arctic offshore lease sales and would not extend current leases. \n \n The announcement has been welcomed by environmentalists. \n \n Miyoko Sakashita, of the Center for Biological Diversity, said the decision was \"great for the Arctic and its polar bears\". \n \n \"We need to keep all the Arctic oil in the ground,\" she said. \n \n US government leases are due to expire in the Beaufort Sea in 2017 and in the Chukchi Sea in 2020. \n \n \"In light of Shell's announcement, the amount of acreage already under lease and current market conditions, it does not make sense to prepare for lease sales in the Arctic in the next year and a half,\" Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said in a statement. \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Environmental activists have long campaigned against offshore drilling in the Arctic \n \n Shell has spent about $7bn (\u00a34.5bn) on Arctic offshore development in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. \n \n However, last month it announced it had not found sufficient amounts of oil and gas in the region to warrant further exploration. \n \n It said it would end exploration off Alaska \"for the foreseeable future\". \n \n Correspondents say the Arctic is a risky and expensive place for oil companies to explore, and the current low price of oil makes it even less attractive. \n \n The US Geological Survey estimates that the Arctic holds about 30% of the world's undiscovered natural gas, as well as 13% of its oil. \n \n However, environmental groups say offshore drilling will pollute and damage a natural wilderness. \n \n They also argue that fossil fuels such as oil and gas must be left in the ground if the world is to avoid runaway climate change. ||||| Date: October 16, 2015 \n \n Contact: Jessica Kershaw, Interior_Press@ios.doi.gov \n \n WASHINGTON \u2013 In light of current market conditions and low industry interest, the U.S. Department of the Interior today announced that it will cancel the two potential Arctic offshore lease sales scheduled under the current five-year offshore oil and gas leasing program for 2012-2017. Today, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) also denied requests from Shell and Statoil for lease suspensions, which would have extended the expiration date of the leases. \n \n \u201cIn light of Shell\u2019s announcement, the amount of acreage already under lease and current market conditions, it does not make sense to prepare for lease sales in the Arctic in the next year and a half,\u201d said Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell. \u201cI am proud of the performance of Interior\u2019s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the U.S. Coast Guard and others in ensuring that Shell\u2019s program this past season was conducted in accordance with the highest safety and environmental standards.\u201d \n \n Under the current Five-Year Program, Chukchi Sea Lease Sale 237 was scheduled potentially for 2016. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) issued a Call for Information and Nominations in September 2013, in response to which industry submitted no specific nominations. Shell recently announced that the results of its exploration well at the Burger J site in the Chukchi Sea did not warrant further exploration in the Burger prospect. \n \n Similarly, Beaufort Sea Lease Sale 242 had been scheduled potentially for the first half of 2017. BOEM published a Call for Information and Nominations in July 2014, but only received one nomination, thereby raising concerns about the competitiveness of any such lease sale at this time. \n \n Today, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) also denied requests from Shell and Statoil for lease suspensions, which would have allowed the companies to retain the leases beyond their primary terms of ten years. The leases will expire in 2017 (Beaufort) and 2020 (Chukchi). Among other things, the companies did not demonstrate a reasonable schedule of work for exploration and development under the leases, a regulatory requirement necessary for BSEE to grant a suspension.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 In bad news for the Alaskan economy but good news for polar bears, the US government blocked new offshore drilling in Alaska's Arctic Ocean and refused to extend two existing leases for Arctic drilling on Friday, the New York Times reports. The Interior Department cancelled auctions for drilling rights in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas while declining to extend the Arctic leases of Shell (expires in 2017) and Statoil (expires in 2020), according to NPR. \"In light of Shell's announcement, the amount of acreage already under lease, and current market conditions, it does not make sense to prepare for lease sales in the Arctic in the next year and a half,\" Interior secretary Sally Jewell says in a statement. The Shell announcement Jewell is talking about is the oil giant's decision last month to halt its Arctic drilling after accidents, delays, and $7 billion with nothing to show for it, the Times reports. The moves by the Obama administration Friday basically block drilling in the Alaskan Arctic for two years. It's a decision one Alaskan senator calls \"stunning,\" \"destructive,\" and \"shortsighted.\" But Miyoko Sakashita of the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity tells the BBC it's great news for the Arctic and its wildlife. \"We need to keep all the Arctic oil in the ground,\" she says. The US Geological Survey believes the Arctic holds about 13% of the world's undiscovered oil, but the Times reports offshore Arctic drilling is declining\u2014due to concerns over safety, cost, and the environment\u2014in the US, Canada, and Greenland.",
