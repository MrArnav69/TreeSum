    "document": "FRANKFURT (MarketWatch) \u2014 Italian government bond yields rose Tuesday after Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services cut Italy\u2019s credit rating one notch, putting further pressure on euro-zone leaders to stem the region\u2019s ongoing sovereign-debt crisis. \n \n Late Monday, S&P; lowered Italy\u2019s long-term credit rating to A from A-plus and cut its short-term rating to A-1 from A-1-plus, citing a weak economic outlook and ongoing political gridlock. S&P; also said the outlook for Italy\u2019s ratings is negative, meaning a further cut is possible. \n \n The move by S&P; took markets somewhat by surprise. All eyes had been on rival ratings firm Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which had announced last week it would take an additional month to decide whether to downgrade Italy\u2019s ratings. \n \n \u201cJust when everyone was waiting for Moody\u2019s to downgrade Italy, S&P; gets in first with what is a much more damaging downgrade as its rating of Italy was already the lowest of the three agencies,\u201d said Gary Jenkins, head of fixed income at Evolution Securities in London. \n \n Click to Play Scrutiny on Italy, Qantas and Japan Asian markets react to S&P's cut to Italy's sovereign-debt rating, while a strike at Australia's Qantas airline leads to flight cancellations for thousands and possible reforms in Japan may lure more foreign investment. \n \n The yield on 10-year Italian government bonds /quotes/zigman/4869096/delayed IT:10YR_ITA -0.07% jumped as many as 16 basis points, but trimmed the initial rise to trade at 5.59% in recent action, a rise of 7 basis points, according to FactSet Research. Yields move inversely to bond prices. \n \n Meanwhile, the premium demanded by investors to hold Italian 10-year bonds over German bunds /quotes/zigman/4869083/delayed DE:10YR_GER +0.02% widened by around 9 basis points to stand at 3.82 percentage points. \n \n Talk of further buying of Italian bonds by the European Central Bank helped pull down yields from initial highs, analysts said. \n \n The downgrade could increase Italy\u2019s borrowing costs just as the country embarks on a large-scale refinancing program that entails nearly 30 billion euros ($41.3 billion) of gross bond issuance in October and November, said Boris Schlossberg, director of currency research at GFT. \n \n \u201cThese upcoming bond auctions could become the true test of the country\u2019s credit strength and, if investors balk at rolling over its debt, the downward pressure on the euro could quickly accelerate,\u201d he said. \n \n On Tuesday, the euro initially dropped against the dollar U.S. in the wake of the downgrade, then bounced. The euro /quotes/zigman/4867933/sampled EURUSD +0.1148% lately traded at $1.3666 in recent action, down from around $1.3685 in North American trade late Monday. \n \n Worries about the banks \n \n Rising borrowing costs highlight worries that the region\u2019s sovereign-debt crisis could engulf Italy, outstripping the euro zone\u2019s rescue resources and throwing the future of the euro into doubt. Italy\u2019s economy is the third-largest in the euro zone and its bond market is the third-largest in the world. \n \n The European Central Bank began buying Italian and Spanish bonds in early August, pulling Italy\u2019s yield down from more than 6% to less than 5%. But yields have crept back up in recent weeks. \n \n Italy\u2019s downgrade highlights worries about Europe\u2019s banking sector, particularly French banks. \n \n Fears over the potential impact of a Greek default on highly-exposed French banks and the rest of the region\u2019s banking sector prompted the European Central Bank and other major central banks last week to pledge to provide increased dollar liquidity amid signs banks are becoming increasingly reluctant to lend to each other. ||||| LONDON \u2014 The Italian government reacted angrily Tuesday to the decision by the credit rating agency Standard & Poor\u2019s to downgrade its debt, describing the move as out of touch with reality. \n \n Late Monday, S.&P.; cut the rating by one notch to A from A+, citing the country\u2019s weakening economic growth prospects and higher-than-expected levels of government debt. \n \n The agency said Italy\u2019s fragile governing coalition and policy differences in Parliament would continue to limit the government\u2019s ability to respond decisively to economic head winds. It also cast doubt on whether the government\u2019s projected \u20ac60 billion, or $82 billion, in fiscal savings would be realized because growth prospects are weakening, the budgetary savings rely on revenue increases, and market interest rates are anticipated to rise. \n \n Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi\u2019s office issued a statement early Tuesday noting that his government had a solid majority in Parliament. It said the government was preparing steps to lift growth and recently passed measures to control public finances through tax increases and spending cuts. \n \n \u201cThe evaluations of Standard & Poor's seem dictated more by behind the scenes reports in newspapers than reality and seems influenced by political considerations,\u201d the statement said. \n \n The yield on Italian 10-year bonds was up slightly by midday Tuesday, but at more than 5.6 percent Italy\u2019s borrowing costs are more than three times what Germany, the euro-zone anchor, pays. Stock markets in Europe also brushed off the downgrade, as investors reacted to positive signals on discussions about aiding Greece, and Spain sold another offering of Treasury bills. \n \n Analysts said the mood was also helped by speculation that the United States Federal Reserve would approve a new program for monetary easing Wednesday to try to stimulate economic growth. \n \n The Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro zone blue chips was up almost 2 percent at midday. The FTSE 100 in London up about 1.5 percent, as was the main index in Milan. Futures contracts on the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index suggested a firmer opening on Wall Street. \n \n S.&P.;\u2019s A rating for Italy is still five steps above junk status, but it is three below that given by another agency Moody\u2019s Investors Service, which is currently assessing Italy. \n \n \u201cMoody\u2019s announcement to extend its review of Italy\u2019s rating by another month last Friday probably gave the market a false sense of relief, especially after persistent speculation of a Moody\u2019s downgrade last week,\u201d said Colin Tan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. \n \n He added that although Italy had covered 77 percent of its 2011 debt funding needs, but there was still another \u20ac100 billion more to be raised before the end of the year. \n \n Italy is the euro zone\u2019s third-largest economy behind Germany and France and is considered to be too big to save should it run into the same kind of trouble that beset Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Although its budget deficit is relatively low, the big concern among investors is that Italy, whose debts stand at 120 percent of its gross domestic product, will find it increasingly costly to borrow. \n \n As a result, the European Central Bank has been helping, buying around \u20ac5 billion to \u20ac10 billion in the riskier euro-area bonds over the last five weeks. But even that has failed to stop Italian bond yields from rising. \n \n \u201cThe E.C.B. will probably need to do more from here,\u201d Mr. Tan said, referring to its bond buying program. \n \n Commerzbank said in a research note that the lengthy process of ratifying changes to the European Union\u2019s main bailout vehicle was starting to impair the effectiveness of the central bank\u2019s bond buying program. \n \n In Athens, meanwhile, talks between Greece and international lenders that began on Monday were due to resume Tuesday night, according to the Greek Finance Ministry. \n \n Greek officials described talks so far with the so-called troika \u2014 the International Monetary Fund, the E.C.B. and the European Commission \u2014 as productive, and they said that a deal may be close. \n \n If there is an accord, the troika would then release the latest tranche of loans \u2014 which the country needs by mid-October to avoid running out of cash to pay its bills. \n \n The Greek press published a list of 15 austerity measures that the troika was said to be demanding of the Socialist government. They included laying off another 20,000 state workers, cutting or freezing state salaries and pensions, increasing heating oil tax, shutting down loss-making state organizations, cutting health spending and speeding up privatizations. \n \n Governments across Spain also are struggling to rein in spending. Teachers in Madrid began a three-day strike Tuesday to protest against staff cuts and longer classroom hours, news agencies reported. \n \n Reflecting the country\u2019s strained finances, Spain sold just under \u20ac4.5 billion in Treasury bills on Tuesday, but at a higher cost. The average yield on the 12-month bill rose to 3.591 percent, compared with 3.335 percent the last time, the securities were sold on Aug. 16, while the 18-month debt yielded 3.807 percent, compared with 3.592 percent last month. \n \n Amid the wreckage of a collapsed housing bubble and weak economy, the latest data from the Bank of Spain showed that the ratio of non-performing loans continued to rise in July, reaching 6.9 percent of all loans. Analysts noted that the level was comparable to that of the previous banking crisis in the early to mid-1990s. \n \n In an interview published Tuesday in the Spanish newspaper Expansion, the E.C.B. president Jean-Claude Trichet said that while Spain\u2019s financial situation has improved considerably, policymakers must remain alert, Reuters reported. \n \n He also said the outlook for the economy had deteriorated and that there were downside risks to growth. \n \n \u201cWe conclude from these comments that Mr. Trichet is still envisaging that there could be a rate cut in the future, but for now he is keeping his powder dry,\u201d said Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays Capital. \n \n Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome.",

    "document": "When you think of chess, what do you picture in your head? Chances are it\u2019s either Bobby Fischer staring at a set of chess pieces like he wants to light them on fire, or it\u2019s two kids in glasses sitting at one of those tables with the built-in gameboards, playing after school while they wait for their parents to pick them up. \n \n Compare that to a typical session with the Chessbrahs , the most popular chess streamers on Twitch. Over the course of one of their streams, which can last up to four hours, you might see chairs thrown amid a torrent of f-bombs , freestyle rapping mid-game , and a never-ending barrage of trash talk . This is the new, online era of chess\u2014set to the soundtrack of dance music. \n \n Twitch, for the unfamiliar, is a website where people watch other people play video games. If that sounds insane to you, then you probably aren\u2019t one of the 150 million users and 1.5 million broadcasters who visit every month, nor are you likely part of the reason it sold to Amazon for nearly a billion dollars in 2014 . \u201ceSports\u201d\u2014competitive, livestreamed video gaming\u2014has grown into a $1.5 billion industry that\u2019s expected to reach $2.3 billion in just five years. While video games like League of Legends and Counter-Strike are what Twitch is best known for, chess, when played online, also qualifies as an eSport, and there\u2019s a significant and growing community of chess players on the site. Of all the chess players regularly streaming on Twitch, among the most popular are world top 10 and multiple-time US champion Hikaru Nakamura and the Chessbrahs, founded and anchored by 25-year-old Canadian grandmaster Eric Hansen. \n \n \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t do chess or try chess because they\u2019re afraid of what their friends will think.\u201d \n \n During the early 2000s, Hansen was a misbehaving kid with an ADHD diagnosis growing up in Calgary. He began playing chess after school as a way to keep his mind occupied. By the time he was a teenager, he\u2019d gotten serious about the game. He earned his grandmaster title\u2014the highest honor available to a chess player, given by the world organizing body FIDE\u2014at the age of 20, after spending a year playing for the University of Texas at Dallas on a chess scholarship, and then moving to Europe to play professionally. \n \n During Hansen's stint in college, he also became one of the first people to livestream himself playing chess. He started streaming purely for fun, sometimes for as many as 10 hours a day on the old Livestream platform, even when only 2 or 3 people were watching. In 2014, after a few years playing in Europe, he returned to Canada. There, burnt out from traveling and hustling on the pro circuit and inspired by the rise of eSports\u2014Hansen was also a serious Counter-Strike player in high school\u2014he decided to see if there might also be an audience for live chess online. \n \n Hansen would sometimes stream for 60 or 70 hours a week, attracting just 10 or 20 viewers. But as he grew his channel, which he called Chessbrah, Hansen drew inspiration from public fitness gurus who invited fans and followers on social media into their lives and their habits. \u201cThere might be these top players in the world, but they\u2019re very inaccessible,\u201d he explains to me over the phone. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what Magnus Carlsen\u2019s life is like.\u201d Carlsen, a 27-year-old Norwegian who is the youngest-ever player to make world number one and the reigning world champion, is basically the LeBron James of chess, and his name is often mentioned as a catchall for the top levels of the game, in terms of both celebrity and skill. \u201cUsually he doesn\u2019t do a lot of interaction with the crowds,\u201d says Hansen, \u201cbecause either the organizers don\u2019t organize these things or the players aren\u2019t using Twitter and Instagram. So I was like, if I\u2019m going to do this, I\u2019m going to try to utilize all this modern stuff.\u201d \n \n From the start, the brashness of Chessbrah belied the stereotypes that tend to plague chess: that it\u2019s stodgy, quiet, the domain of old Russians and lonely kids. Hansen and his chess-player friends were into dance music and partying, and they\u2019d get together to drink beer, goof around, and go to raves. They were typical twentysomething Canadians in every way\u2014except that their parties often involved high-speed chess. Rather than conform to notions of what the chess world was like, they decided to make it their own. \n \n \u201cWe always thought the stereotypes were something we could change and that didn\u2019t even apply to us, and it wasn\u2019t necessarily fair for the whole game itself,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cOne of the reasons why I did Chessbrah, and why it\u2019s called Chessbrah, is that a lot of people don\u2019t do chess or try chess because they\u2019re afraid of what their friends will think.. But the game itself is really fun, and I\u2019m sure a lot more people could like it than the current numbers indicate.\u201d \n \n In Europe, Hansen explains, the game enjoys a different, hipper, \u201cnicer\u201d status as a sport. People of all ages and all genders play, sometimes in bars; during his time there, he says, girls clamored to meet him and his fellow players. Part of Hansen\u2019s genius is combining the communal, European embrace of the game with the North American penchant for being loud, controversial, and, well, a bit of a bro. (Like so much of the internet, it\u2019s hard to tell how much of Chessbrah\u2019s frat-boy persona is genuine and how much is a kind of pro-wrestling put-on\u2014seeing Hansen curse and throw a chair after losing to Nakamura, you\u2019re reminded that the Twitch audiences reward this kind of outlandish behavior\u2014but there\u2019s no question that it\u2019s about as far from visions of golf commentary and hushed tones as it gets.) \n \n \u201cYou might see chairs thrown amid a torrent of f-bombs, freestyle rapping mid-game, and a never-ending barrage of trash talk. This is the new, online era of chess.\u201d \n \n Chessbrah, of course, has its critics: Hansen says that the channel was extremely unpopular with the vibrant chess community on Reddit at first. The comments his stream initially received from Redditors were often brutal. In addition, his approach could be mystifying to more conventional chess players and fans, who tended to see the game as incompatible with dance music and trash talk. \n \n But detractors had to contend with the fact that Hansen is also really, really good: He\u2019s currently the 152nd-ranked player in the world, and the Chessbrah channel is filled with other grandmasters, including universally respected GM Yasser Seirawan, whose regular presence adds some gravitas. \n \n \u201cIt was a really hated stream for the first year or so. I didn\u2019t mind because\u2014and again, this is more part of the North American culture\u2014but if you don\u2019t have haters you\u2019re not being yourself and expressing your opinions,\u201d Hansen says. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I have no issue with, taking criticism and negative feedback. People will really insult you, but we\u2019re not a PC stream. We\u2019re just all over the place, and we knew that would generate controversy and that chess was very conservative. But the whole point was to disrupt some of the traditional chess ideas.\u201d \n \n At the other, more traditional end of the online chess spectrum, at least in terms of demeanor, is John Bartholomew. Bartholomew, 31, is an International Master (IM), the rank just below GM, every chess player\u2019s ultimate goal. Though, according to the World Chess Federation there are 1,598 GMs and an additional 3,674 IMs, Bartholomew stands out from the pack thanks to the 50,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel , where he\u2019s become one of the best sources online for learning how to play the game well. \n \n Though it\u2019s often said there have been more books written about chess than all other games and sports combined \u2014a claim that probably dates back to the early 1900s , a time of great development and theorizing for chess\u2014one of the biggest problems with learning chess from books is that many of them don\u2019t become comprehensible until well into a student\u2019s journey. Even works for beginners can be daunting if one isn\u2019t familiar with, or interested in, the notation and move variations that fill their pages. \n \n Bartholomew, on the other hand, is remarkably easy to understand, simplifying his explanations to the point that even a brand-new player can follow his beginner videos with relative ease. His \u201c Chess Fundamentals \u201d series features the 31-year-old playing through a number of games online with a particular focus on the cornerstones of solid chess, like undefended pieces , typical beginner mistakes , and pawns . Collectively, the five videos have generated more than 400,000 views, making them among the most popular on his channel. \n \n Bartholomew has been teaching chess for a decade. Growing up in Minnesota, he began playing in the second grade, honing his skills against an old-school chess computer. Once he beat the 72nd and final level of the computer program, a process that took him a year and a half, Bartholomew started playing in tournaments and working with a local Russian coach. At the age of 15, he became National Master, the level below IM, making him the youngest NM in the history of the state of Minnesota, a record since broken by another popular online player, GM Andrew Tang. That triumph was followed by numerous victories in national tournaments and, eventually, a full-ride scholarship to play chess at the University of Texas at Dallas. (Yes, full-ride scholarships for chess do exist.) \n \n \u201cThe thing that chess has is it\u2019s a great game. It\u2019s like getting vegetables, but you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re getting vegetables.\u201d \n \n After graduating in 2009 with a degree in business\u2014which was followed by one semester in law school\u2014Bartholomew decided to commit to teaching chess full time. He quickly found that, even though he\u2019d moved to New York, most of the teaching he was doing was happening online. He returned to Minnesota in 2012 and launched his channel the following year with the idea that an audience would keep him accountable to practicing and playing more. Also, he wanted to prove that he wasn\u2019t nuts. \n \n \u201cI had been really working hard at building my teaching business, trying to make a legitimate career out of chess\u2014or at least enough money to support myself and prove that it was a viable thing going forward, and that I wasn\u2019t crazy for foregoing using my degree or dropping out of law school,\u201d Bartholomew explains. \n \n Back then, a few other players were also dabbling in the YouTube world\u2014the German IM Christof Sielecki, whose information channel Chessexplained served as an early model, and American IM Greg Shahade , now the commissioner of the PRO Chess League \u2014but he was still surprised by how quickly his audience grew. After a month or two, he posted one of his videos on the chess subreddit , where he remains beloved among the 85,000 or so subscribers. The channel took off from there. \n \n Since then, along with his series for beginners, he\u2019s produced hundreds of videos that feature him analyzing his own games against other titled players and skilled opponents. He maintains a friendly, almost gentle demeanor, like the nicest guy you knew in high school if he was really good at chess. Bartholomew\u2019s videos usually involve visuals of the game he\u2019s playing placed alongside footage of him talking into a webcam. While this might sound monumentally dull to the uninitiated, it\u2019s the chess equivalent of being able to see an NFL game through the quarterback\u2019s eyes as you listen to his thoughts. (Bartholomew\u2019s audience isn\u2019t there just for the chess: as is so often true on YouTube, they\u2019re also there for the personality.) \n \n In a testament to how invested his audience is, Bartholomew\u2019s recent videos chronicling his progress toward becoming a GM, which he hopes to accomplish in the next year, have been receiving thousands of views, even though they\u2019re just Bartholomew summarizing his performance in earlier over-the-board games. He recently received a $1,369 donation while streaming on his new Twitch channel. One of the reasons the platform is so appealing to players is that audience members have the option to subscribe to streamers, and watching someone react to a donation is a major part of the draw. \n \n \u201cIf you\u2019ve watched a top-level chess player analyze, oftentimes they\u2019ll do these variations and they\u2019ll just rattle them off, and the person who\u2019s interviewing them at a tournament or asking them about the game is completely lost,\u201d Bartholomew says. \u201cI think that\u2019s one reason that chess has actually been lagging behind in the online space compared to some other games. I think for a long time, top-level players have either not wanted to talk down to normal chess players or even completely casual players, or they haven\u2019t been able to do that en masse, and only now are you starting to see guys like me, Eric Hansen, and Christof emerge.\u201d \n \n If Hansen and Bartholomew represent two different ends of the chess streaming spectrum, then Chess.com and IM Danny Rensch, 32, are what occupy the center, giving online chess a firm foundation and a place from which it can build. The company, which began in 2005 with the savvy acquisition of its URL, functions like a combination of ESPN and a worldwide amateur sports league. It features a slate of original programming and top-level competitions with commentary, while also hosting 1 million amateur chess games a day. While there are other chess-specific platforms online, including the popular lichess.org , Chess.com is the biggest and most robust. At any given time, you can see titled players online and drop in on their games; you can take lessons and practice tactics; and you can watch ChessTV, which offers up content like GM-led teaching shows and live broadcasts of competitive tournaments. \n \n Rensch, who describes himself as the CCO\u2014Chief Chess Officer\u2014of Chess.com , is also the face of ChessTV. A young phenom who made National Master at 14, becoming the youngest-ever NM from the state of Arizona, Rensch had his career stunted by a series of health issues in his late teens. He used the illness-generated downtime to get acquainted with the growing world of YouTube, Google AdWords, and e-commerce, and, in 2007, bought the URL chesscoaching.com and set off on a career in teaching. Soon afterward, he crossed paths with Erik Allebest and Jay Severson, the owners and founders of Chess.com , and within a year he was on salary at their new company. \n \n Chess.com runs the most significant competitions in online chess, including the second year of the PRO Chess League, which features 32 teams from around the world. (Magnus Carlsen plays for the Norway Gnomes and Hikaru Nakamura for the Seattle Sluggers. Bartholomew and Hansen are also featured, the former on the Minnesota Blizzards and the latter on the Montreal Chessbrahs.) In addition to driving enormous amounts of traffic to the site, these leagues and tournaments have served as significant signposts in the evolution of chess into a major eSport. The 2016 Speed Chess Championship, which featured a final between Carlsen and Nakamura , was the third-most-watched stream on Twitch, with 195,220 unique viewers and a maximum concurrent audience of 30,942. Last year\u2019s rematch boasted twice as many unique viewers and a maximum concurrent audience of just under 35,000. \n \n Building this sort of audience and programming wasn\u2019t instant\u2014or easy. Five years ago, Rensch was tasked with figuring out what the future of chess broadcasting might look like. One of his first ideas was reaching out to Twitch, where Chess.com became one of the platform\u2019s earliest partners and, in another marketing coup, he secured the Twitch.tv/chess URL. Second, he realized that Chess.com \u2019s original approach to programming, which focused on shows anchored by one player and coverage of over-the-board\u2014chess-speak for IRL\u2014events, just wasn\u2019t working. What was working, however, was a show he hosted called \u201cBullet Brawls,\u201d in which he simply turned on a webcam, played chess, and chatted with fans. \n \n \u201cI was shocked by the success of [it],\u201d says Rensch. \u201c[It] was something that I didn\u2019t understand about the chess community that the Chessbrahs have frankly done better than all chess streamers combined, which is that they get to know the people in the chat and the fans, and they engage, and they just hang out and listen to music and act like idiots, right? And it\u2019s like, what are you doing? But guess what, people love it!\u201d \n \n The success of \u201cBullet Brawls\u201d led to further discoveries, supported by data and analytics. The fans liked commentary and analysis, but at a level they could understand. They liked faster games with less time for players to complete their moves. These shorter time controls led to more mistakes and more suspense. (Think of what the shot clock does for basketball.) This learning greatly influenced the way Chess.com designed its leagues. There was an operation that already existed called the US Chess League, run by the IM Greg Shahade, but it had longer time controls and required players to show up in person, negating two of the major assets online chess has over over-the-board play. When the two organizations ultimately partnered up in 2016 , they adopted the Chess.com rules, shortening the time controls and letting players play from home. \n \n \u201cWhat\u2019s made the PRO Chess League successful? The fact that Magnus Carlsen can play in his pajamas with his shirt off!\u201d Rensch says. \n \n As for their non-league programming, Rensch and the other Chess.com streamers began integrating even more fan interaction, including programs like Amateur Hour, where Rensch partners with lower-level players and gives them feedback on their games. \n \n \u201cChess was very conservative. But the whole point was to disrupt some of the traditional chess ideas.\u201d \n \n One of those players, former-NFL-offensive-lineman-turned-MIT-math-PhD John Urschel, 26, has been a particularly popular, and frequent, guest on the program . Urschel freely confesses that he wants to become a master\u2014and considering he once played at the highest levels of professional football, it\u2019s hard to doubt his prospects. Since his retirement, he\u2019s become an avid chess player and frequent streamer. Aside from his appearances on Chess.com \u2019s programming, where he\u2019s also played celebrity games against the popular videogame-streamer Hutch and has a show called Urschel Learns Chess , he streams regularly on Twitch, something he was encouraged to do by Rensch. \n \n \u201cI actually really took to it. The best part is interacting with so many people all across the world who also love chess, who also want to learn and also want to get better,\u201d Urschel says. He also praises Hansen and GM Aman Hambleton, another face of the Chessbrahs. \u201c[They] have done so much to popularize chess and dispel this notion that chess players are just these strange fringe people who sit in a room by themselves all day and just study chess, don\u2019t talk to anyone, are antisocial,\u201d he said. \u201cChess can be very collaborative, it can be very fun, and it can be cool.\u201d \n \n Aside from the pure entertainment of it, Urschel sees chess as a game with immense potential to help people, including kids, engage their intellectual capacities. \n \n \u201cThe thing that chess has is it\u2019s a great game, but at the same time, it\u2019s something that\u2019s really, really training your quantitative skills in a really good way,\u201d Urschel says. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting vegetables, but you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re getting vegetables.\u201d \n \n Of course, chess isn\u2019t immune from one particular dilemma that plagues eSports, not to mention the rest of the Internet and the world: sexism. The gender gap in chess is a longstanding and controversial problem , and it\u2019s hardly a shock that bringing the sport to the male-dominated world of Twitch and online streaming didn\u2019t help to solve the issue. While there are a number of master-level female players who feature in Chess.com \u2019s coverage and programming, one doesn\u2019t have to spend much time on one of their streams to see the typical dynamics play out\u2014comments about looks and assumptions about how being a woman affects players\u2019 qualifications and opinions. \n \n Alexandra Botez, 22, a Woman FIDE Master (WFM), the title with slightly lower rating requirements open only to women, recently made $850 in donations in about four hours streaming on Twitch. Botez is another Canadian. The 22-year-old won a number of Canadian girls\u2019 national titles as well as the US girls\u2019 title when she was 15, then she went to Stanford, where she founded a startup. For Botez, making \u201ca month\u2019s rent over two two-hour streams\u201d is a perk of using Twitch. But for women, streaming comes with a price men don\u2019t have to pay. \n \n \u201cA lot of the streams are super-masculine. People love to see streamers get super upset or super excited.\u201d \n \n Botez says that last year when she was streaming on Chess.com , \u201chalf of the messages started turning out extremely sexual, the kind of stuff that is totally R-rated and nobody wants to deal with. \u2026 It was just offensive and I felt terrible.\u201d \n \n She stopped streaming soon after that, wanting to avoid the medium entirely. But after about a year away, Botez decided to return, and the addition of a moderator\u2014an anonymous individual who goes by chessbae94 and moderates a number of chess Twitch streams\u2014has helped to rectify the problem. \n \n \u201cShe moderates my chat, she takes out all of the negative stuff, and somehow we\u2019ve managed to grow it slowly, but still have a very positive community,\u201d Botez says. \u201cI\u2019m also not as sensitive anymore to the male culture. I know that a lot of the streams are super-masculine, and that\u2019s the kind of thing that people like to watch on Twitch. People love to see streamers get super upset or super excited. But I decided that either way, if I want to stream and I want to have a good time doing it, I\u2019m going to have to be myself anyways.\u201d \n \n The question of what people want to watch is at the center of chess\u2019s future as an eSport. Hansen believes that the viewer experience for streaming chess still has room for improvement, citing the robust production values and public visibility of other eSports as well as the continuing conservatism of much of the game\u2019s culture. Bartholomew, meanwhile, is focused on building his own Twitch presence and making GM, a title he thinks is within reach this year. As for Chess.com and Rensch, they solidified their presence on Twitch with a recent deal that makes Chess.com and its streamers the centerpiece of chess coverage on the platform, in addition to offering benefits to streamers who partner with Chess.com . (The topic is of enough interest to the chess community that Bartholomew\u2019s exclusive deal with Chess.com was the subject of a thread on the chess subreddit that received over 150 comments.) \n \n The goal, as Rensch sees it, is a groundswell of support for both streamers and their audiences that can help further establish chess as a major eSport, with that popularity trickling down to all aspects of the game. \u201cWe believe that the market has been proven for chess on Twitch. Twitch believes the market has been proven. And now we want everybody to believe that they can stream,\u201d Rensch says. \u201cJust like in eSports, there\u2019s the huge events, the championships, but where all of those players are building their brands and making money is they have their own personal Twitch channels all year, and they have huge followings.\u201d \n \n As with other eSports, streamed chess is now adding an IRL component. Chess.com and Twitch recently announced that the finals of the PRO Chess League would be held in San Francisco this year in a two-day event at the Folsom Street Foundry, where the players will appear live and the games will be streamed on Twitch, with Rensch and Botez providing commentary. Sure, it isn\u2019t exactly Bobby Fischer versus Boris Spassky at the height of the Cold War\u2014but an event at a San Francisco brewpub being streamed across the world is about as emblematic of chess in 2018 as Fischer and Spassky\u2019s match was in 1972. A game doesn\u2019t survive for hundreds of years if it doesn\u2019t change to fit the spirit of the times, and with streaming, chess has entered a new age. \n \n This article was originally published as part of our Off Topic newsletter, where you get an original story delivered to your inbox each and every week.

Somewhere in the middle is perhaps the biggest player of all, Chess.com, led by IM Danny Rensch, 32, who also is a major chess presence on Twitch.

But it was also used to justify abolition \n \n \"Why don't they kill us?\" asks Calvin Candie, the southern slave owner in Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained. He wants to know why the African slaves he brutalises do not rise up and take revenge. Before long, he has the skull of a recently deceased slave on the dinner table. \"The science of phrenology,\" he announces, \"is crucial to understanding the separation of our two species.\" He hacks away at the back of the skull with a saw, removing a section of the cranium and pointing to an allegedly enlarged area. In African slaves, Candie claims, this bump is found in the region of the brain associated with \"submissiveness\". \n \n For Candie, phrenology not only explained slavery, it justified it. \n \n Needless to say, phrenology has now been thoroughly debunked: the idea that the shape of the skull can be used to infer mental characteristics is just plain wrong. But it was extremely popular all over the world during the 19th century, finding converts among reform-minded Bengalis in Kolkata, India, and colonial settlers in Australia. As part of my research into the global history of phrenology, I came across the real-life Calvin Candie. \n \n He was called Charles Caldwell, a doctor from Kentucky who revelled in both phrenology and slave ownership. As in the film, Caldwell was a Europhile, travelling to Paris in the 1820s where he picked up the latest medical craze. He later returned to France in the 1840s in order to hobnob with Pierre Marie Dumoutier, a phrenologist just back from a three-year round-the-world voyage. \n \n Slave owner and phrenologist Charles Caldwell. Photograph: Public domain \n \n At the time, Dumoutier's immense collection of skulls and casts could be found at the Mus\u00e9e de Phr\u00e9nologie in Paris. There Caldwell could practise phrenology, feeling for bumps on the heads of Tahitians and Marquesas Islanders. No doubt he was considered very \u00e0 la mode back in Kentucky. In fact, Caldwell even boasted of being one of the earliest experts in phrenology in the United States. \n \n Caldwell deployed phrenology in almost exactly the same manner as the fictional Candie. In 1837 he wrote to a friend claiming that \"tameableness\" explained the apparent ease with which Africans could be enslaved. This was a standard phrenological argument. Areas located towards the top and back of the skull, such as \"Veneration\" and \"Cautiousness\", were routinely claimed to be large in Africans. His correspondent concurred, writing: \"They are slaves because they are tameable.\" Clearly enjoying himself, Caldwell replied: \"Depend upon it my good friend, the Africans must have a master.\" \n \n Areas for 'veneration' and 'Cautiousness' were said to be large in Africans. Photograph: Alamy \n \n It's worth emphasising that these words are not from a Tarantino script, crafted for Hollywood shock value. They were written by a slave owner desperate to preserve his brutal way of life. And, while the physical violence of slavery is masked in Caldwell's letters, they betray his warped sense of morality. In a letter written on Christmas Eve 1838, Caldwell made the outrageous claim: \"My slaves live much more comfortably than I do.\" \n \n The fact that phrenology was used to justify slavery is perhaps unsurprising. What would one expect from such an overtly racist science? But it wasn't just the slavers. My research revealed that some of the most vocal anti-slavery campaigners of the 19th century were also advocates of phrenology, and used it to justify their stance. \n \n Lucretia Mott, a particularly uncompromising American abolitionist, sent her children to phrenological lectures and spoke of the \"truth of phrenology\" in letters to friends. When she visited Britain she stayed with the renowned Scottish phrenologist George Combe, himself an anti-slavery campaigner. Horace Mann, another major figure in abolitionist politics, was so keen on phrenology that he subscribed to the official journal. After becoming president of Antioch College in Ohio, he even boasted in the same sentence that the professors he employed were both \"anti-slavery men\" and \"avowed phrenologists\". \n \n Photograph: public domain \n \n These are not isolated examples. If anything, the majority of phrenologists were against slavery. \n \n How can this be? George Combe, a man whose phrenological books sold more copies during the 19th century than Charles Darwin's Origin of Species, explained his reasoning: \"The qualities which make them submit to slavery are a guarantee that, if emancipated and justly dealt with, they would not shed blood.\" \n \n For abolitionists, the apparent weakness and timidity of the Africans served two purposes. It countered fears that they would take revenge on their masters if set free. It also provided a moral argument: if Africans were innately weak, society should help them, not enslave them. \n \n In the 19th century, scientific racism and abolition were by no means mutually exclusive.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A celebrity chef has spent tens of thousands of dollars to quietly change the name of his Manhattan restaurant after he discovered its meaning had racial undertones. Per the New York Times, Tom Colicchio, the lead judge on Bravo's Top Chef, originally called his eatery in the New York City's financial district Fowler & Wells, named after publishers Samuel Wells and brothers Lorenzo and Orson Fowler, whose building rested on the same site as Colicchio's restaurant in the mid-1800s. However, a little digging by Colicchio's team after they'd already named the restaurant revealed \"facts about [the Fowlers' and Wells'] beliefs that go against everything we stand for,\" per a statement cited by Page Six. More specifically, the Fowlers and Wells were advocates of phrenology, the study of the shape and size of the skull, which many in the 19th century believed to be an indicator of one's mental abilities\u2014and which was often used to \"prove\" African-Americans were mentally inferior and to justify slavery (at least one of the Fowler brothers had eyebrow-raising thoughts on this). Colicchio, who's an outspoken liberal on social media, said that although his team incorporated the concept of phrenology into the restaurant's theme (including on the bar's menu), they didn't initially realize quite how bad the practice's roots could be. Once they made this discovery, they went about coming up with a new name and reworking logos, signage, business cards, and menus to match.

Iranian soldiers march in formation during the Army Day military parade in Tehran April 18, 2011. \n \n DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran makes no distinction between U.S. and Israeli interests and will retaliate against both countries if attacked, an Iranian military commander said on Wednesday. \n \n The comments came after the White House denied an Israeli news report that it was negotiating with Tehran to keep out of a future Israel-Iran war and as U.S. President Barack Obama fends off accusations from his election rival that he is too soft on Tehran. \n \n \"The Zionist regime separated from America has no meaning, and we must not recognize Israel as separate from America,\" Ali Fadavi, naval commander in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was quoted as saying by the Fars news agency. \n \n \"On this basis, today only the Americans have taken a threatening stance towards the Islamic Republic,\" Fadavi said. \"If the Americans commit the smallest folly they will not leave the region safely.\" \n \n Iran - which has missiles that could reach Israel and U.S. targets in the region - has conducted military exercises and unveiled upgraded weapons in recent months, aiming to show it can defend itself against any strike against its nuclear sites. \n \n Israel - thought to be the only country in the Middle East with nuclear weapons - says the prospect of a nuclear armed Iran would pose a threat to its existence. Tehran denies it is developing weapons and says its nuclear program is peaceful. \n \n With the approach of U.S. elections in November, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called for a tougher stance against Iran - implicitly knocking Obama's emphasis on diplomatic and sanctions pressure to halt Iranian nuclear work. \n \n While Israel would expect U.S. backing if it decided to strike Iran, the top U.S. general has suggested Washington would not be drawn into a conflict. \n \n \"I don't want to be complicit if they choose to do it,\" Britain's Guardian newspaper quoted Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey as saying. \n \n Netanyahu abruptly ended a meeting of Israel's security cabinet on Wednesday, saying someone in the forum had leaked details of its discussions on Iran. \n \n Any decision to go to war against Iran would, by Israeli law, require the approval of the security cabinet. One government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no such decisions had been on the table at Tuesday's meeting. \n \n (Reporting By Yeganeh Torbati; Editing by Robin Pomeroy) ||||| An Israeli attack on Iran would delay but probably not stop its nuclear programme, the most senior US military officer has claimed. General Martin Dempsey reinforced Washington's opposition to unilateral Israel military action as he made clear that US military chiefs were equally wary of getting ensnared in Syria. \n \n In common with Nato's supreme commander, US admiral James Stavridis, who wrote about Afghanistan for the Guardian on Thursday, Dempsey put a brave face on the situation there. The chairman of the joint chiefs of staff was speaking to journalists in London, where he attended the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games as head of the US delegation. \n \n Distancing himself from any Israeli plan to bomb Iran, Dempsey said such an attack would \"clearly delay but probably not destroy Iran's nuclear programme\". \n \n He added: \"I don't want to be complicit if they [Israel] choose to do it.\" \n \n Dempsey said he did not know Iran's nuclear intentions, as intelligence did not reveal intentions. What was clear, he said, was that the \"international coalition\" applying pressure on Iran \"could be undone if [Iran] was attacked prematurely\". Sanctions against Iran were having an effect, and they should be given a reasonable opportunity to succeed. \n \n On Syria, he said, Washington was collaborating with the country's neighbours, sharing intelligence and helping with military planning. The US was supplying humanitarian aid to Turkey. \n \n But Dempsey warned of the implications of establishing a \"humanitarian zone\" inside Syria, as suggested by others, including France, have suggested. Syria was not Libya, he said, there was no comparison. \n \n Those who established a humanitarian zone would be obliged to assume responsibility for protecting it, Dempsey said. That would mean not merely establishing a no-fly zone but providing protection against Syrian missiles. \n \n The US, like the UK, was supplying \"non-lethal\" aid to Syrian rebels. What he described as \"any broader activities inside Syria\" would have to be discussed and conducted within the Nato framework, Dempsey said. The worst-case scenario would be Syria ending up as a failed state, he said. He was reflecting growing concern in the west and elsewhere, including Russia, about the crisis allowing armed extreme jihadists and al-Qaida sympathisers with the opportunity to increase their influence and expand control across Syria. \n \n In Afghanistan, the Taliban were using young men in \"green on blue\" attacks \u2013 attacks by Afghans in army uniform \u2013 as part of a new asymmetric weapon, as improvised explosive devices had been in the past, Dempsey suggested. \n \n A rapid expansion of Afghan security forces from some about 200,000 to more than 300,000 in two years had \"exposed vulnerabilities in vetting practices\", he said. \n \n Nato had to help develop Afghan forces to ensure Nato troops ended their combat role by the target date of the end of 2014, \"and we will\", Dempsey said. \n \n Stavridis wrote that \"measurable and substantial progress\" has been made in Afghanistan in three specific areas. Firstly, Afghanistan is no longer a safe haven for terrorists, he said. Secondly, Afghan national forces have improved markedly over the past 18 months, \"to the point where they are making significant gains in the fight against the Taliban\". As a result, \"this has been a particularly difficult summer for the insurgency, which has seen the elimination of two top-level commanders in the past few days alone\". \n \n Thirdly, the international community has made specific pledges on long-term partnerships with Afghanistan. \n \n Stavridis said Afghan society was changing for the better every day, but acknowledged that the Nato-led coalition faced formidable challenges over the next few years. \"I have no doubt that there will still be difficult days ahead.\"",

He fought unsuccessfully to get back in, he said. \n \n Bild quotes security sources as saying that the pilot used an axe to try to break down the door. \n \n A Germanwings spokesperson would only confirm that an emergency axe is part of the equipment on board an A320. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Rescuer Jean Sebastien Beaud describes the plane crash scene as \"surreal\" \n \n What happened in the final half hour? \n \n Family members of some of the 150 passengers and crew who died have visited Seyne-les-Alpes, near the crash site, reported Reuters news agency. \n \n They were accompanied by psychologists, paramedics and Red Cross workers, and a youth centre in the town was set up to receive them, it said. \n \n Families are providing DNA samples to allow for identification of victims' remains. \n \n Meanwhile, investigators continue to comb the crash site for body parts, debris and the second \"black box\", which records flight data and still has not been found three days after the plane crashed. \n \n Flight club \n \n Members of the Westerwald flight club, where the co-pilot was a member, expressed their shock at the revelations about Mr Lubitz's mental history. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Members of the flight club where Andreas Lubitz was a member have been talking about his personality \n \n \"Andreas was a very nice young man, who did his training here.

Or even in Spanish, a language that tens of millions of Americans speak? \n \n The United States' political slugfest is now crossing new frontiers. Less than two weeks before the presidential election, Donald Trump's campaign has released an ad airing on TV channels aimed at Indian Americans in which he not only speaks Hindi (albeit roughly), but adopts the main campaign slogan of India's prime minister, Narendra Modi. \n \n \u201cAb ki baar Modi sarkaar.\u201d Those were the words Modi used to fuel his landslide victory in May 2014. They mean: \u201cThis time, a Modi government.\u201d In the ad, which you can watch below, Trump switches Modi's name out for his own. \n \n Republican Donald Trump's presidential campaign has released an ad aimed at Indian Americans in which he speaks Hindi and adopts the main campaign slogan of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. (Shalabh Kumar) \n \n The ad comes on the heels of Trump's address to the Indian American community at a convention center in Edison, N.J., on Oct. 15. Featured in the ad are clips from his speech, which he used to assure Indian Americans that the United States and India would be \u201cbest friends.\u201d \n \n [At Hindu-American rally, Trump pitches India and U.S. as \u2018best friends\u2019] \n \n In the speech, as in the ad, he expressed a deep admiration for Modi, who was denied a U.S. visa in 2005 over his alleged support for Hindu extremists during Hindu-Muslim riots in 2002. Modi has since rebuilt his reputation among U.S. officials and hosted President Obama in New Delhi in 2015 and visited the Oval Office in June for talks. \n \n \u201cI will look forward to working with Prime Minister Modi, who has been very energetic in reforming India's bureaucracy,\u201d said Trump at the rally in Edison. \u201cGreat man! I applaud him for doing so. And I look forward to doing some serious bureaucratic trimming right here in the United States. Believe me, we need it also.\u201d \n \n Campaign outreach in various languages is not groundbreaking. Trump's Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, began running a Spanish-language TV ad last week, and has run radio ads in Florida in Creole for Haitian American voters. In 1988, Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis often sprinkled his speeches with Greek. \n \n This may be the first time Hindi has made the list for a targeted ad. It also seems like a long shot. \n \n Trump severely lags behind his Clinton in support from Indian Americans. Only 7 percent of likely Indian American voters indicated in a recent survey that they intended to vote for him, as opposed to 70 percent who said they would vote for Clinton. \n \n Nevertheless, a group called the Republican Hindu Coalition, led by Indian American electronics magnate Shalli Kumar, is hoping to persuade some in the community to vote Trump. Kumar and his immediate family have donated about $2 million to the Trump campaign, and he spent upward of $3 million of his own money on organizing the event in Edison, a city with a large Indian American population. \n \n [Indian Americans vote solidly Democratic, but some hope Trump can change that] \n \n Trump's perceived tough stance on \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d is one issue Kumar thinks can swing the traditionally Democratic voting bloc Republican. In the new ad, Trump uses those three words while a picture of Mumbai's iconic Taj Mahal hotel burns in the background. The hotel was attacked in 2008 by terrorists operating out of Pakistan who arrived in the port city by boat. \n \n Yet, with polls shaping up decidedly in Clinton's favor in the lead-up to November's election, a Modi-esque landslide for Trump is unlikely. And given that Indian American voters make up a minuscule percentage of the American voting public, the community was never going to tip that balance anyhow. \n \n Read More: \n \n Indian security forces went on a village-burning rampage, investigation finds \n \n From a Nat Geo cover to a mug shot: The sad story of the green-eyed \u2018Afghan Girl\u2019 \n \n India expels Pakistan\u2019s embassy employee on espionage charges ||||| Image copyright Shalabh Kumar \n \n US presidential candidate Donald Trump has spoken a few words of Hindi in a video aimed at wooing Indian-American voters. \n \n He is appropriating Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's popular campaign slogan \"Abki bar Modi sarkar\" (\"This time Modi government\"). \n \n The video was made to air on Indian TV channels in the US, Buzzfeed quoted Shalabh Kumar, a member of Trump's Indian-American Advisory Committee, as saying. Mr Kumar supports Mr Trump and says he made the video with him to appeal to Hindi speakers. \n \n However, if the reaction of Indians in Delhi is anything to go by, Mr Trump still has some work to do. \n \n As the BBC's Vikas Pandey found out in a quick survey on the streets of the Indian capital, no one was very impressed by the video. \n \n 'India is not just Hindus, Mr Trump' \n \n Image caption Shailesh Yadav believes that Mr Trump will not be a friend of India \n \n Shailesh Yadav said he felt disgusted after watching the video because \"Mr Trump seemed to be addressing only Hindus through the video\". \n \n \"How could he just assume that Hindus means India?

And so he's released a TV ad in which he attempts to speak Hindi (with a New York accent, the Post notes), swapping his name into a slogan used by Indian PM Narendra Modi during his own 2014 campaign. The 30-second ad kicks off with a Diwali greeting, followed by an abruptly edited score and clips from a Trump speech he gave to Indian-Americans in New Jersey on Oct. 15. In that speech, he promises the US will be a \"true friend\" to the \"Indian and Hindu community\" and help it defeat \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" \"We love the Hindus! We love India!\" he proclaims. Then, his new catchphrase as he speaks directly to viewers: \"Ab ki baar, Trump sarkaar\" (\"this time, a Trump government\"). As for reaction from Delhi residents, the BBC found that Trump \"still has some work to do\" in wooing Indians. One commenter on the street said he was \"disgusted\" by Trump's appeal to only the Hindu community when \"Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians also live in this country\" and noted he hoped \"Americans will be smart enough to not vote this guy into power.\" A female respondent said, \"He is not a friend of India,\" adding his speech seems \"rehearsed\" and that he appears to be a \"man of contradictions.\" \"He first berates immigrants and then tries to woo Indian-Americans,\" she said.

This means they have both male and female sexual organs and can use them both at the same time. \n \n Bernard Picton, curator of marine invertebrates at the National Museums Northern Ireland, explained: \"The genital apparatus is on the right hand side of the body. So two nudibranchs come together and one faces one way and one faces the other way, with the right hand side of their bodies touching. \n \n \"The penis from one fits into the female opening of the other one, and the penis from that one fits into the female opening of the first one, if you see what I mean. \n \n \"They are both donating sperm to the other one.\" \n \n But the finding that one species has added another layer of complexity to copulation surprised the sea slug expert. \n \n \"I haven't seen anything like this before,\" he said. \n \n Sexual healing \n \n Image caption The Japanese team of scientists observed the animals as they mated \n \n The Japanese team observed sea slugs that they had collected from shallow coral reefs around Japan. They saw the animals mate 31 times. \n \n The act took between a few seconds and a few minutes, after which the creatures would push away and shed their penises, leaving them on the floor of the tank. \n \n However, the researchers were surprised to discover that just 24-hours later, the sea slugs had regenerated their male organs and were able to mate again. \n \n Closer examination of the animals' anatomy revealed that the sea slugs had a large part of their penis coiled up in a spiral inside their bodies, which they would then use to replenish their missing part. \n \n The scientists also noted that the penis was equipped with spines. \n \n At most, the animals were able to copulate three times in succession, with each bout separated by about 24 hours. \n \n It was not clear once the internal penis was used up after these attempts whether the animal's sex life - at least the male part of it - was effectively over or - after a few weeks or months - the organ could regrow. \n \n No great loss \n \n Sea slugs are not the only animals who abandon their penis. \n \n They do have very very complicated biology Bernard Picton, National Museums Northern Ireland \n \n Orb weaving spiders are known to lose their male organs after sex, as does a sea creature called the periwinkle and land slugs belonging to the genus Ariolimax. \n \n However the researchers believe that Chromodoris reticulata is the first creature known that can re-grow its appendage - and its disposable penis gives it a sexual advantage. \n \n The Japanese team says that in the first act of copulation the penis may be used to remove any sperm left by any competitors that its partner has mated with. \n \n With the first penis and the rival sperm then abandoned, the second penis can be used to inject the sea slug with another dose of its own sperm, ensuring that their genes are the ones that are passed on. \n \n Mr Picton said: \"They do have very, very complicated biology - and a lot have awfully complicated things in terms of reproduction.\" ||||| Sea animal has grow-again penis \n \n PARIS \u2014 Scientists reported Wednesday on the bizarre sex life of a sea slug that discards its penis after copulation. Then grows a new one. \n \n \"No other animal is known to repeatedly copulate using such 'disposable penes',\" Japanese biologists wrote in the Royal Society journal Biology Letters, describing the behaviour as \"extremely peculiar\". \n \n Dubbed Chromodoris reticulata in Latin, the red-and-white slug -- technically a shell-less mollusc -- inhabits warms waters in Southeast Asia. \n \n The critter needs 24 hours between couplings to unroll an internally coiled and compressed juvenile penis to replace the used, external bit, the scientists found. \n \n It can repeat this feat at least three times. \n \n The human thumb-sized slug is an hermaphrodite, meaning it has both male and female sexual organs. \n \n The animals perform dual sexual roles during copulation. They give sperm to a mating partner while simultaneously receiving sperm, which they store for later insemination. \n \n The team observed copulation between sea slugs that they had captured during scuba dives and held in a tank. \n \n After each coupling, which lasted between dozens of seconds and a few minutes, every slug discarded its penis -- a thread-like organ that it projects from its side into a partner's vagina. \n \n The team also examined the microscopic structure and function of the male organs -- observing an internal spiral structure they believe grows into a replacement penis. \n \n \"We propose that the tissue at the spiral part of the penis is compressed and undifferentiated, gradually differentiating into the 'next penis',\" the team wrote. \n \n \"It may need approximately a day for the spiral structure to be ready for copulation.\" \n \n In another revelation about the sea slug's sex life, the scientists found its penis was covered with spines -- and suggested these may be used to remove the sperm of previous partners being held in store by their mate. \n \n The spines are backward-pointing, making it difficult to withdraw the penis after copulation. This may explain the organ's disposable nature. \n \n \"Chromodoris reticulata may compensate for the short-term cost of decreased reproductive opportunities caused by the loss of a penis with the reproductive advantage gained by sperm displacement,\" wrote the study authors. \n \n Various animals are known to discard parts of their body, such as the gecko which sheds its tail. \n \n Few, though, are willing to part with their penis, the team noted with clinical understatement. \n \n Copyright \u00a9 2013 AFP.

A team of Japanese researchers discovered the surprising behavior in the species, which lives in the Pacific Ocean, the BBC reports. Chromodoris reticulata is the first creature known to have what they're calling a \"disposable penis.\" Other creatures discard their sex organ post-copulation, but they don't re-grow it. The researchers called the slug's behavior \"extremely peculiar.\" A large part of the slug's penis is actually an internal one that's coiled inside its body; this is what regenerates the detached portion after sex. The studied slugs were seen to mate three times in a row, 24 hours apart each time; it's not clear if the penis could regenerate once again, perhaps months later. The evolutionary purpose? Scientists aren't quite sure, but they say the purpose of the first sex act may be to remove any sperm left by a previous partner. The disposable penis is far from the slugs' only sexual quirk: The penises are equipped with spines that could help with the removal of prior sperm, AFP reports. The creatures are also \"simultaneous hermaphrodites,\" which means they have male and female sexual organs that can be used simultaneously.",

And it would expand time credits that reward good behavior and create new ones for participating in job-training and other programs that allow offenders to reduce their time behind bars. \n \n The legislation would also improve conditions for incarcerated women, prohibiting the shackling of female inmates while pregnant, and would require the Bureau of Prisons to locate prisoners in facilities close to their homes, if possible. \n \n The Fraternal Order of Police, the country\u2019s largest police organization, said last Friday that it would support the bill, and the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association appeared to have dropped some previous objections after exceptions were made to block certain fentanyl offenders from eligibility for \u201cgood-time credits\u201d included in the prison overhaul portion of the bill. \n \n But powerful pockets of opposition remain among some law enforcement officials and conservative lawmakers \u2014 like Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas \u2014 who argue that sentencing changes like those proposed pose a risk to public safety. However, they lost a powerful ally within the administration when Mr. Trump fired his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, last week. Mr. Sessions\u2019s temporary replacement, Matthew G. Whitaker, has signaled that he is more open to the changes. \n \n Mr. Trump himself is leery of appearing weak on crime, and he has been susceptible to arguments from opponents of a sentencing overhaul that endorsing one could arm his critics. Still, Mr. Kushner has pressed the issue for months, and some of the president\u2019s advisers say they think the effort could help improve his anemic standing with African-American voters, even if only marginally. \n \n In his remarks on Wednesday, Mr. Trump tried to address both points, saying that the legislation would be tougher on hardened criminals. But in a reference to the tough-on-crime policies embraced by President Bill Clinton, Mr. Trump also said that the legislation would begin to roll back portions of the \u201cClinton crime bill\u201d that had a \u201cvery disproportionate and very unfair\u201d effect on black Americans. ||||| Donald Trump boosted hopes of federal criminal justice reform on Wednesday by announcing his support for the First Step Act, which seems increasingly likely to get a floor vote in the Senate before the end of the year. \n \n California rethinks life sentences for thousands of non-violent third-strike offenders Read more \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re all better off when former inmates can re-enter society as law-abiding, productive citizens,\u201d Trump said at the White House. \u201cAmericans from across the political spectrum can unite around prison reform legislation that will reduce crime while giving our fellow citizens a chance at redemption.\u201d \n \n The act would expand rehabilitative opportunities for people in prison; ban some of the most startling correctional practices, such as the shackling of pregnant women; and reduce mandatory minimum sentences for a number of drug-related crimes. \n \n Sign up for the new US morning briefing \n \n The rare bipartisan effort was bolstered by a letter to senators from public figures including Van Jones, Mark Cuban, Patricia Arquette, Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West. A copy obtained by the Guardian called on Congress to \u201crecognize the humanity\u201d of inmates and declared that \u201c186,000 people in federal prison and their family members\u201d were counting on elected representatives to act. \n \n \u201cThe time is now,\u201d the letter said. \n \n The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, must now decide whether to bring the bill up for a vote. He has promised to do so if 60 votes for it can be expected \u2013 the amount needed to clear a filibuster. He also said, however, that he will have to see how the legislation \u201cstacks up\u201d with other priorities in the limited time before recess. \n \n As with previous iterations of the bill \u2013 which has been in the works since 2015 \u2013 negotiations have concerned two components: prison reform and sentencing reform. \n \n Prison reform, which focuses on improving conditions in federal prisons and programs to facilitate re-entry into society, enjoys broad bipartisan support. Sentencing reform, which would remove some harsh sentencing minimums imposed in the 1990s, is favored by Democrats but has fractured Republicans. \n \n First Step passed the House in May with only prison reform included, earning support from virtually all Republicans and more than two-thirds of Democrats. Generally speaking, those Democrats who held out did so on the principle that criminal justice reform legislation must include sentencing reform. \n \n A number of prominent senators, including the Republican judiciary committee chairman, Chuck Grassley, and progressive Democrats, blasted the bill for not including sentencing reform. But the bill had its all-important supporter: Trump. Early in his administration, Trump tasked his top aide and son-in-law Jared Kushner with orchestrating the administration\u2019s work on the issue. At a bipartisan forum on criminal justice reform at the White House, the president promised he would sign the First Step Act. \n \n In the six months after the passage of the House bill, Senate lawmakers led by Grassley set about drafting their own version that could include sentencing reform without alienating Trump or Republican supporters. \n \n That effort appears to have been successful. Late last week the bill earned the support of the national Fraternal Order of Police, which may have helped convince otherwise wavering Republicans. \n \n \u201cWe could not have gotten here without the support and feedback of law enforcement,\u201d Trump said on Wednesday. \n \n While conservatives have largely joined progressives in seeking criminal justice reform \u2013 it is now a significant plank in the platform promoted by mega-donors Charles and David Koch \u2013 many on the right nonetheless remained fearful of being seen as anti-law enforcement. \n \n Jessica Jackson-Sloan, national director for reform advocacy group Cut50, said the process of earning diverse endorsements was delicate and involved substantial concessions on all sides. \n \n \u201cThey say bipartisanship is dead and they say working with unlikely allies is dead,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I think this bill really shows that when you roll up your sleeves, you negotiate, and you both compromise, this is what can happen.\u201d \n \n The conservative case for criminal justice reform Read more \n \n The proposed sentencing reform would get rid of so-called \u201cthree strikes\u201d mandatory life sentences for defendants facing a third drug conviction, except for those with a prior \u201cserious violent felony\u201d, and eliminate \u201cstacking\u201d regulations that make it illegal to posses a firearm while committing a crime, even if the firearm is not used. It would also effectively reduce a slew of federal mandatory minimum sentences by allowing judges to circumvent them for non-violent offenders when they see fit. \n \n The bill would also retroactively extend the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, a move that could affect thousands of drug offenders serving disproportionately long sentences for crack cocaine versus the powder variant. \n \n Some advocates say the prison reform could release 4,000 people currently serving long sentences, give elderly and terminally ill inmates a path home and invest tens of millions in re-entry programming. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on a rewrite of criminal justice sentencing laws (all times local): \n \n 4:45 p.m. \n \n President Donald Trump says he's \"thrilled\" to support a bipartisan bill to reform federal sentencing guidelines. \n \n The legislation is the first major rewrite of the nation's criminal justice sentencing laws in a generation.

    "document": "Read next: The Apple TV review. \n \n Starting today, millions of people in the US can buy HBO without cable. HBO Now has officially launched across Apple TV and iOS. Subscriptions can be purchased directly through iTunes \u2014 your first month is free \u2014 and the HBO Now iPhone app hints that Cablevision will begin selling the service very soon. So now that it's here, what's HBO's standalone service like to use? Well, it's very familiar. It's HBO Go sans cable. In other words, it's exactly what we were anticipating, and that's fine. \n \n Setting up an account \n \n We had some trouble registering for the service in the immediate moments after it went live this morning. Things seem to be settling now, but some users are still experiencing problems. As you go through the set-up process, you'll agree to a bunch of fine print most people will probably ignore. But there's some interesting stuff in there. For one, HBO is reserving the right to change the amount of simultaneous streams that customers can watch whenever it chooses and without warning. \n \n HBO may change the maximum number of simultaneous streams and/or registered devices that you may use at any time. \n \n HBO reserves the right to shut down password sharing \n \n Should login sharing become a real problem that eats into HBO Now's success, the company has given itself full allowance to get much stricter about where and when you can watch. But don't be alarmed just yet. Knowing that this is a service for cord cutters, HBO is at least partially open to the idea of users sharing HBO Now between family members. Another section of the user agreement mentions that you can add \"authorized users\" who can use the service under your own account. HBO warns that this should only be used for people living in the same household, but will that be something it somehow tries to enforce? There's no telling right now. \n \n It's just what you'd expect (for now) \n \n Once you successfully register, you'll find that the HBO Now app on Apple TV is largely identical to HBO Go. And there's no reason it shouldn't be; HBO has made clear from the start that Now would offer its full vault of original shows and catalog movies. You're not losing anything here compared to cable customers, nor should you expect to get anything extra. At least, not yet. Fast Company's interview with CEO Richard Plepler hints that HBO Now may eventually offer programming that won't appear on the main, linear network. Those possibilities are exciting, but they're not here at launch. \n \n Aside from the home screen, HBO Now's main navigation bar is divided into six sections: Watchlist, Series, Movies, More, Search, and Settings. Aside from \"More,\" which is where you'll find HBO sports and comedy specials, they're all pretty self explanatory. From anywhere in the app, you can add shows and movies to your Watchlist. Series is where you'll find HBO's long history of acclaimed original shows like The Sopranos or current hits like Game of Thrones. As for movies, HBO has a pretty extensive collection of on-demand films, and helpfully gives you the precise date when each one will be leaving the service. \n \n As usual with Apple TV apps, navigating around is dead simple. It's incredibly user friendly and obvious; select any show or movie and you can start playing it instantly, watch a brief preview, add it to your watch list, or hit \"more\" for cast and crew information. So the Apple TV channel is functional, but also a bit bland and inelegant. Especially in the movies section, expect to find yourself scrolling through large grids of icons, which has become another hallmark of the Apple TV experience. None of that's a huge annoyance on iPhone or iPad, where things are laid out better and browsing content is faster and more efficient since you're swiping through everything. \n \n The Apple TV experience is a bit boring, but it works just fine \n \n If HBO Go is any indication, the company will have more freedom to experiment with menus and user interface whenever Now inevitably reaches other living room boxes and game consoles. (See: HBO Go on PlayStation 4.) Still, it's perfectly usable on Apple TV, and you're here for the content more so than the app itself. Playback seems to work just fine. Streams start up promptly and display in HD without any noticeable buffering or freezing issues, so MLB Advanced Media seems to be doing a decent job handling the backend of HBO's standalone service. So far, anyway. We'll see how things hold up Sunday night when the internet is in full Game of Thrones mode. Reliability may go out the window. \n \n If you're in Apple's ecosystem, it's a no brainer \n \n Signing up for the free month's trial of HBO Now is something of a no brainer. This is something people have spent years waiting for, and it won't take long to decide whether HBO's content library is worth your $14.99 each month. And even then, remember that there's no commitment involved, so you can theoretically come and go whenever your favorite HBO shows are in-season. Obviously the company would prefer you stick with it, but there's nothing that says you have to. \n \n At launch, HBO Now on Apple TV is just what we expected it to be. It's HBO Go without the costly cable package. If you don't have any Apple devices around, jumping in right now might not make the most sense. Cord cutting Android users will need to keep borrowing someone else's HBO Go login for now. In the months ahead, HBO Now should develop into a richer experience and one available on many more devices. But for right now, all you need is the internet \u2014 and Apple. Thankfully, an Apple TV will only cost you 69 bucks. ||||| HBO Now, the new standalone version of HBO that doesn\u2019t require a cable subscription, is finally here. The app launches exclusively on Apple devices\u2014iPhones, iPads, and the Apple TV to be specific\u2014so if you have one of those then legal, non-moocher, cable-free HBO is just a few taps away. \n \n Unlike just stealing HBO credentials from your parents or partner, HBO Now costs $15 a month, but also helps you foster the delusion that you are truly a Good Person who pays for content, and not at all a thief. And if you sign up this month, you\u2019ll get a free 30-day trial. Just enough time to see the beginning but not the end of this season\u2019s Game of Thrones. \n \n Advertisement \n \n For now, the HBO app is exclusive to iOS but there are some ways around it. Once you download the HBO Now app on your iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV and sign up, you can also watch on any computer at HBONow.com. And if you don\u2019t have an iOS device but you do have Cablevision\u2019s Optimum Online, you can buy it through that and then just watch on the website. \n \n Obviously the app will be coming to other places eventually (one can only assume Android, Xbox, and nearly every set-top box, much like HBO Go), but for now it\u2019s iOS, Cablevision or nothing. But even with those artificial and temporary constraints, the days of HBO without the cable are finally here. \n \n ||||| Time Warner Inc.\u2019s Home Box Office unit said Tuesday that its stand-alone streaming service HBO Now is available to users of Apple Inc. products and customers of Cablevision Systems Corp.\u2019s Optimum Online. \n \n About 2,000 titles are available through the service for $14.99 a month. The company is offering a 30-day free trial to customers who sign up in April. The launch comes in time for the premiere of the fifth season of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d on Sunday. \n \n ...",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's another win for cord-cutters, but in this case they'll still need some ties to Apple or Cablevision. Customers of either company now have access to HBO Now, a stand-alone streaming service that offers HBO content for $15 a month, reports the Wall Street Journal. Those who sign up in April can try it out for free the first month. (Everyone's pointing out that HBO made the service available ahead of Sunday's premiere of the new Game of Thrones season.) Apple customers can get HBO Now though an app on the iPhone, iPad, or iPod, or via Apple TV. Subscribers to Cablevision's Optimum Online also can get it via an app. Some quick reaction: \"It's HBO Go without the costly cable package,\" writes Chris Welch at the Verge. \"If you don't have any Apple devices around, jumping in right now might not make the most sense.

I'm here to say I'm on the side of the murdered.\" \n \n The group gathered Saturday in Manhattan's Greenwich Village neighborhood at Washington Square Park before marching about 2 miles along Sixth Avenue. The protesters walked past lines of police officers who had cordoned off a lane of traffic for them. As they moved, those with megaphones shouted stories of the slain as others waved signs with photos of the dead, mostly young black men, and the dates and places of their deaths. \n \n The event was the last of three demonstrations the group RiseUpOctober organized in New York this week. Speakers at the protest said they want to bring justice for people killed by police. \n \n Temako Williams walked arm in arm with academic and activist Cornel West, one of the organizers. Her son, La-Reko Williams, was killed by police in 2011 in Charlotte, North Carolina. A federal jury ruled that a Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer, who did not face criminal charges, had used excessive force, and it awarded her $500,000. \n \n But, she said, the money is no substitute for justice. \n \n \"It wasn't worth the price of my son's life,\" she said. \"It's a wound that won't heal.\" \n \n While police were present all along the protest route, the day was peaceful. No arrests were reported. \n \n The protest came at a time of heightened awareness nationwide of the oft-contentious relationship between police officers and the people they serve. New York's mayor and police commissioner have said they're serious about enacting smart reforms to build trust between police and communities. \n \n But the protest also was days after a New York police officer, Randolph Holder, was shot to death while chasing a bicycle thief. A suspect has been charged with murder and robbery in the case. \n \n The Rev. Al Sharpton dedicated his weekly radio broadcast and rally at his National Action Network headquarters to Holder. Sharpton and others went to the Brooklyn neighborhood where Holder served to lay a wreath and pray for him and his family. \n \n Activist Carl Dix, who helped found RiseUpOctober with West, said that while he sympathized with Holder's family the officer's death did not affect the need to hold Saturday's rally as scheduled. \n \n \"That's not what this is about,\" Dix said. \"This is about all the people who are murdered by the police.\" ||||| The city\u2019s police union is calling for a boycott of Quentin Tarantino films after the \u201cPulp Fiction\u2019\u2019 director took part in an anti-cop rally less than a week after an officer was killed on the job. \n \n \u201cWhen I see murders, I do not stand by . . .

The indictment accuses Hastert of agreeing to pay $3.5 million to a longtime acquaintance to cover up wrongdoing in his past, then lying to the FBI when asked about the suspicious cash withdrawals from several banks. \n \n \"The Wheaton College statement on the Hastert indictment has been updated to indicate that the name of the J. Dennis Hastert Center for Economics, Government, and Public Policy at Wheaton College has been re-designated as the Wheaton College Center for Economics, Government, and Public Policy,\" according to the college's statement Sunday. \n \n The Tribune reported Friday that federal law enforcement officials said Hastert was paying an individual from his past to conceal sexual misconduct. The misconduct dates to Hastert's time as a high school wrestling coach and teacher in Yorkville, one official told the Tribune. \n \n Hastert attended Wheaton College as an undergraduate student and graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1964. \n \n He remained an active alumnus over the years, and more than seven years ago, the college named the Hastert Center after him. \n \n According to its website, the center promotes ideas such as free enterprise, limited government and individual responsibility through classroom teaching, research and public discussion. \n \n The Wheaton College Archives & Special Collections includes a collection of Hastert's papers, according to the college. What might become of the collection could not immediately be addressed Sunday, a college spokeswoman wrote in an email.

But soon thereafter, he withdrew the proposal at the request of Hastert, whom the feds accused this week of lying to FBI agents and trying to hide financial transactions intended to keep prior misconduct secret. \n \n \u201cAbout a month ago, the speaker contacted this office and asked that the whole [statue] idea be deferred,\u201d Madigan spokesman Steve Brown told ABC News. \u201cSo, we honored that request.\u201d \n \n Brown said Hastert cited \u201cthe state\u2019s fiscal condition\u201d in making the case that the project not move forward. \u201cHe thought the state\u2019s fiscal condition made it a not wise use of state funds,\u201d he said. \n \n Though Madigan\u2019s office did not question Hastert\u2019s reasoning, Brown said they had no concerns about the financial viability of the statue project. \u201cWe thought it was appropriate,\u201d Brown said of the $500,000that would have gone to the statue\u2019s construction. \n \n Madigan served alongside Hastert in the Illinois legislature in 1980s.

Yet bank officials soon discovered that other Bloomberg reporters were using the approach on other stories unrelated to the trading loss. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n When Goldman raised the issue with Bloomberg last month, the media company dispatched senior sales executives to Goldman\u2019s Lower Manhattan headquarters, according to people briefed on the matter. The Bloomberg officials assured top bank executives, including Gary D. Cohn, the firm\u2019s president and chief operating officer, that the problem would be resolved. \u201cWe brought this matter to the attention of the news organization, and senior management at the company assured us that they were taking immediate measures to address the problem,\u201d a bank spokesman said. \n \n Matt Winkler, editor in chief of Bloomberg News, also contacted Goldman to apologize for the incident. In a meeting on Friday, he reminded reporters of the company\u2019s policy about terminal use and the employee confidentiality agreement. \n \n Jonathan Corpina, a managing partner at Meridian Equity Partners, said the incident was a reminder that nothing \u2014 not even the seemingly secure Bloomberg terminal \u2014 was private. \u201cIt concerns people that what they are doing is being watched and monitored by people who shouldn\u2019t be watching and monitoring it,\u201d Mr. Corpina said. \n \n Mr. Bloomberg founded Bloomberg L.P. in 1982 as a financial information company. The company had revenue of $7.9 billion in 2012 and its high speed, data-splicing terminals occupy a prominent spot on traders\u2019 desks. Even though Bloomberg News has gained prominence, counting the weekly magazine Businessweek among its assets, about 85 percent of the company\u2019s revenue comes from its terminals. That business provides for generous employee perks, and cushions Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s $27 billion fortune. \n \n In the early 1990s, when Bloomberg L.P. had just started to build its news division, reporters were encouraged to leverage the terminals as a way to get a leg up on the competition, said several former employees who would discuss practices only anonymously. Reporters often went on sales calls to talk to banks and hedge funds about the news division to help the company sell terminals. The practice became much less pervasive as Bloomberg became an established news outlet, although many Bloomberg veterans still consider the news division solely a means to sell more terminals. \n \n Thomson Reuters, which sells a desktop financial data product that competes with Bloomberg and, like Bloomberg, employs thousands of news journalists, promptly seized on its rival\u2019s headache. \u201cThomson Reuters Financial and Risk business and Reuters division operate completely independently with reporters having no access to nonpublic data on its customers, especially any data relating to its customers use of its products or services,\u201d said Yvonne Diaz, a Thomson Reuters spokeswoman. ||||| The information appeared to concern general functions used by the officials and the frequency with which those functions \u2014 such as looking at a bond, equity markets or news \u2014 were accessed. The source said all Bloomberg journalists who knew of this capability of the terminal would have had access to the usage information of the officials. However, CNBC has no information that the data were either used by the employees for journalism or shared inappropriately. \n \n (Read More: Privacy Breach on Bloomberg Terminals ) \n \n In response to queries that Bloomberg journalists had access to officials data usage, a Bloomberg spokesman said, \"What you are reporting is untrue\" but declined to respond when asked what specifically was inaccurate. He also would not say whether the company had investigated journalists' access to this information. \n \n CNBC is a competitor of Bloomberg in reporting and distributing business news on the web and on television. \n \n The issue of Bloomberg journalists' access to individual data from the terminals was revealed in recent days when a reporter called a Goldman Sachs Group employee inquiring about a partner's employment status and noting the partner had not logged on to the terminal lately. \n \n The incident prompted a complaint from Goldman and led Bloomberg to terminate the ability of reporters to monitor subscribers. \n \n (Read More: Wall Street: How Much Does Bloomberg Know?) \n \n In a statement on its website, Bloomberg said, \"Having recognized this mistake, we took immediate action. Last month we changed our policy so that all reporters only have access to the same customer-relationship data available to our clients.\" \n \n The former Bloomberg employee who worked in the editorial section recalled calling up the information on Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner \"just for fun\" and displaying the information to new recruits \"to show how powerful\" the Bloomberg terminals were. \n \n The former employee said he recalled seeing the functions used by the Fed Chairman and Treasury Secretary and the number of times those functions had been used. The person did not recall which specific functions he saw, but said it would have been at a broad level. For example, he said it would likely have been information that the official accessed a page such as global equity indexes, though not which markets specifically. He said it also could have included information that the user looked up bond spreads, but the information would not have shown what specific bonds were searched by the user. \n \n (Read More: Technologies That Could Change the World) \n \n Still, with thousands of functions, the information could apparently get quite specific. And knowing how often a user looked up individual information and how often the user was logged in could provide valuable information. \n \n A JPMorgan Chase source told CNBC that, \"Multiple Bloomberg reporters very openly were using terminal login data to determine when traders were suspended and/or let go \u2014 during the London Whale situation, as well as during other rounds of layoffs.\" \n \n A Quartz story (www.qz.com) said Bloomberg employees had accessed a transcript of a call of former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan to the company's help desk. The story said the information was not used in any editorial pieces written by journalists. \n \n",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Bloomberg LP operates both a multi-platform media organization, Bloomberg News, and a computer system, Bloomberg Terminal, that bankers and traders use to monitor market data. The problem: Bloomberg News reporters can see how and when any customer has been using a terminal, and now it turns out they have been using that access to snoop on Wall Street and break news, the New York Times reports. And it may have gone even further than just traders: a former Bloomberg staffer now says he also accessed the terminals of Ben Bernanke and Timothy Geithner, according to CNBC. The issue was first discovered when a Bloomberg reporter asked Goldman Sachs if a partner had recently left the firm because he hadn't recently logged into his terminal, the New York Post revealed. JPMorgan claims Bloomberg may have used data from terminals to break the \"London Whale\" scandal, the Post reports. The Times says \"several hundred\" reporters have used the technique, gaining access to 315,000 subscribers worldwide. Bloomberg has called the news-gathering process \"a mistake,\" and has cut off its journalists' access, reports the AP. But the damage may already be done: the terminal is Bloomberg's primary money-maker, with firms paying around $20,000 a year to use it, and Wall Street is not happy.",

Then they would use a program called \"UUID\" to get details on users' activities, including when they last logged on and how often they used certain functions, reports the New York Times.

Will Microsoft, Pfizer or GlaxoSmithKline, for example, now also choose to cut their funding to this organisation? \n \n You also have to wonder if any of the scheduled conference speakers are now having doubts about whether they want to be associated with Heartland.

    "document": "Feds may set Gulf oil slick ablaze \n \n A satellite shot, taken Monday, of the oil slick off the coast of Louisiana. \n \n \n \n \n \n NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- Coast Guard officials are considering setting the Gulf of Mexico oil slick on fire as it moved Tuesday to within 20 miles of sensitive ecological areas in the Mississippi River Delta. \n \n Officials say it could become one of worst spills in U.S. history. \n \n Oil is still leaking at a rate of about 42,000 gallons a day from the well, located some 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana beneath a drill rig that exploded and sank last week. Eleven workers are still missing following the incident, and are presumed dead. \n \n BP, the well's owner, is racing to shut off the well using eight remote controlled submarines, but has had no luck as of yet. \n \n \"If we don't secure the well, this could be one of the most serious oil spills in U.S. history,\" Coast Guard Rear Admiral Mary Landry, head of a joint response task force, said at a press conference Tuesday afternoon. \n \n Twenty miles is the closest the slick has come to land so far. \n \n Officials said oil slicks are sometimes set on fire, especially when they are near sensitive marsh areas where heavy equipment used to clean the oil may cause more harm than good. \n \n If the slick is set on fire, it would be a controlled burn using fire-proof booms, and only done during the day, said Landry. It could begin as early as Wednesday. \n \n The spill, measured from end to end, stretched as wide as 42 miles by 80 miles, although oil isn't necessarily covering that entire area. \n \n Most of the slick is a thin sheen on the water's surface, ranging in thickness from a couple of molecules to the equivalent of a layer of paint. About 3% of it is a heavy, pudding-like crude oil. \n \n At its current flow rate would take over 260 days to rival the Exxon Valdez disaster, which discharged some 11 million gallons into Alaska's Price William Sound. Still, even if it never compares to the Exxon Valdes spill's size, if it makes landfall it'll have serious ecological repercussions. \n \n The Coast Guard, BP, and the rig's owner Transocean (RIG), have deployed nearly 50 vessels to help contain and clean the slick. \n \n Marine life has been spotted in the area. Over the weekend a plane from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service sighted five small whales nearby. Crews working to contain the spill were alerted to their presence. \n \n Efforts are also underway near the shoreline to deal with the spill should it reach land, including positioning boom material around sensitive ecological areas. \n \n Five staging areas have been set up on land, stretching from Venice, La. to Pensacola, Fla. \n \n Landry said it appears the slick should remain at sea for at least the next three days, although weather reports for the latter part of that period suggest the wind could shift and blow the slick toward land. \n \n The oil, if it stays at sea, will eventually evaporate, breakdown and sink, or get cleaned up. \n \n But analysts have said the spill could have political fallout, especially if it reaches shore. \n \n Several lawmakers and interest groups have led a charge over the last several years to open up more parts of the U.S. coast for oil drilling, efforts that are generally supported by the public. \n \n That support could erode if crude oil starts washing up on the Louisiana or Mississippi coasts. \n \n The well is expected to continue leaking until it is sealed. The leak appears to be coming from a pipe that ran from the well head to the drilling rig, which is now laying upside down in 5,000 feet of water not far from the well head. \n \n It has not been decided if the rig will be salvaged or remain where it is, a Transocean official said Monday. \n \n To seal the leak, three approaches are being tried. \n \n BP is now using a set of remote controlled submarines in an attempt to activate the well's \"blow out preventer\" -- a steel device the size of a small house that sits atop the well and is intended to choke off the flow of oil in the event of a disaster. \n \n It's not clear why that device didn't not originally act to cap the well, or if it will be of any use going forward. \n \n BP (BP) is also bringing in another drilling rig which could seal the well, but that effort will take months, according to a BP spokesman. \n \n In the meantime, the company is also trying a novel approach to capture the oil -- using a dome right above the well head. The dome resembles an inverted funnel, with a pipe leading up to ships waiting at the surface to capture the oil. That tactic has never been tried in water this deep. \n \n A BP spokesman said the dome should be ready in two to four weeks. \n \n The blast last week, which is still under investigation, resulted in 11 workers going missing. The search for them was suspended last Friday. \n \n 115 other people made it off the rig after it exploded, most of them safely. One person remains in the hospital. ||||| With a vast oil slick now within only 20 miles of the ecologically fragile Louisiana coastline, Coast Guard officials said they were considering a \u201ccontrolled burn\u201d of the petroleum on the surface of the Gulf of Mexico. \n \n Rear Adm. Mary E. Landry, the federal on-scene coordinator for the spill, said such a burn might be conducted as soon as Wednesday. \n \n A joint government and industry task force has been unable to stop crude oil from streaming out of a broken pipe attached to a well 5,000 feet below sea level. The leaks were found Saturday, days after an oil rig to which the pipe was attached exploded and sank in the gulf about 50 miles southeast of Venice, La. An estimated 42,000 gallons a day are now spilling into the Gulf of Mexico. \n \n Officials said Tuesday that wind projections indicated that the oil would not reach land in the next three days, and it was unclear exactly where along the Gulf Coast it might arrive first. \n \n \u201cIf some of the weather conditions continue, the Delta area is at risk,\u201d said Charlie Henry, scientific support coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \n \n Admiral Landry said a final decision had not been made yet about whether to burn the oil. \n \n \u201cWe fully understand there are benefits and trade-offs,\u201d she said. \n \n But she also noted that with the spill moving toward land the impact on the shoreline had to be considered. That part of Louisiana contains some 40 percent of the lower 48 states\u2019 wetlands and is spawning grounds for countless fish and birds. \n \n Controlled burns have been done and tested before, Admiral Landry said, and had been shown to be \u201ceffective in burning 50 to 95 percent of oil collected in a fire boom.\u201d The downside, she said, was a \u201cblack plume\u201d of smoke that would put soot and other particulates into the air. \n \n The consideration of burning was raised as the spill seemed to enter a direr phase. Short-term fixes have been unsuccessful, and political reaction has intensified. \n \n On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said they were expanding the government\u2019s investigation of the explosion that caused the oil rig disaster. The inquiry will have subpoena power and will look into possible criminal or civil violations by the operators of the drilling rig, Transocean, a Swiss company, and related companies. \n \n Administration officials also met Tuesday with top executives of BP, which was leasing the rig and is required by law to pay for the cleanup. Last fall, as the federal government was weighing tougher safety and environmental rules for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, BP objected, saying its voluntary programs were successful. \n \n BP engineers have not been able to activate a device known as a blowout preventer, a valve at the wellhead that was supposed to stop oil flow in an emergency and is the only short-term solution for capping the well. \n \n Doug Suttles, the chief operating officer for exploration and production at BP, defended the company\u2019s efforts, and said the cleanup was costing $6 million a day. He said engineers had not given up on engaging the valve and were exploring other possible fixes. \n \n Mr. Suttles said that a plan to use a type of tent or dome to collect the oil was progressing and was two to four weeks from being operational. On Tuesday, the company received permits to drill a relief well, which would be started half a mile from the current well site. Crews plan to drill toward the current well and then inject it with heavy fluids and concrete to seal it. That solution is experimental at this depth, however, and is months away. \n \n Coast Guard officials said they were not expecting landfall for the spill in the next three days. But Doug Helton, the incident operations coordinator for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s emergency response division, said winds would change Wednesday and start pushing the spill north and west toward the Mississippi Delta. \u201cIt is going to land eventually,\u201d Mr. Helton said. \n \n The prospect alarmed fisherman and ecologists along the Louisiana coast. Gov. Bobby Jindal requested that the Coast Guard set up protective booms around several wildlife refuges in the Delta. \n \n Those delicate coastal rookeries and estuaries factor into the consideration for the surface burn. Such a burn would most likely ease the impact on wildlife. \n \n The oceanic agency issued a guide to the burn that advised as follows: \n \n \u201cBased on our limited experience, birds and mammals are more capable of handling the risk of a local fire and temporary smoke plume than of handling the risk posed by a spreading oil slick. Birds flying in the plume can become disoriented, and could suffer toxic effects. This risk, however, is minimal when compared to oil coating and ingestion.\u201d \n \n Admiral Landry said that a burn would take place offshore where no one on land could see it. \n \n A burn does not get rid of the oil entirely. It leaves waxy residue that can either be skimmed from the surface or sink to the bottom of the ocean. \n \n John M. Broder contributed reporting from Washington.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The Coast Guard is considering setting the gigantic oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico ablaze as it approaches land. A controlled burn to burn off the oil could happen as soon as today if winds keep pushing the Rhode Island-sized slick toward ecologically sensitive areas of the Mississippi Delta, CNN reports. \"We fully understand that there are benefits and trade-offs\" in torching the slick, the admiral co-ordinating federal operations told the New York Times.

Check out the first installment below, and visit MUNCHIES tomorrow for part two! \n \n MUNCHIES: It\u2019s been ten years since you worked in the White House, but you\u2019ve kept very busy since. What do you miss about working there, and what are you glad to be done with? \n \n Walter Scheib: When you work at the White House, you\u2019re working at what we used to call \u201cWhite House flex time,\u201d which means you get to choose any 85 hours you want to work each week, and the rest of your free time is yours. [laughs] I don\u2019t miss that component, but what I do miss is being in the White House. I miss getting to service the First Family in that way and to the country, you get that honor and that privilege of getting to know the President and his family\u2014 not as the cartoon characters you see on the nightly news, but as the nuanced and very real and interesting people. Secondly, the camaraderie of the team\u2014of all 90 employees in the residence\u2014really are a distinct and unique group of individuals, not only in their particular expertise and the talents that they have, but more importantly, their understanding of the heart of service of working for this family. You basically become anonymous\u2014you check your ego and your politics at the door and you\u2019re only there to give the First Family an island of sanity in a very crazy world. It takes a unique temperament to be able to do that for an extended period of time. \n \n Do you miss it, or are you relieved that your life is less stressful now? \n \n Well, last year I did 85 events and was on the road for 300 days a year, as there is a tremendous interest in hearing humorous and humanizing stories about the two First Families. It really is a word-of-mouth business; the more you do, the more you do. I thought that after a year or two the novelty would wear off, but it\u2019s been proven that each year it actually gets more busy than the previous. Of course, with Secretary/Senator Mrs. Clinton running for president and being, at the very least, a favored candidate to be in the big race, that of course will increase interest that much more. \n \n It\u2019s known that she\u2019s a huge fan of yours, and personally chose you for the role of chef while she was the First Lady. Do you think you could be called back into service if she succeeds? \n \n Well, I mean, of course if the President asks you to be of service to the country, you\u2019d be hard-pressed to say no. If she wants me, she knows my phone number and I\u2019ll be of service. I don\u2019t care if it was a Republican or Democrat, if I knew them or didn\u2019t know them\u2014if the President asked me to serve, I would do it. \n \n There are no tasters. The idea of a taster is a very Medieval one. If you wanted to poison someone these days, it could take up to a couple of weeks to even have an effect. \n \n It would probably be a lot different now since Bill is basically a vegan. \n \n Well, that\u2019s the urban myth. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s true. If you\u2019re trying to keep a fairly austere regimen\u2014and veganism is that in my estimate\u2014it\u2019s very difficult to do. I think you have to present that you\u2019re doing it full-time and taking it seriously so that you don\u2019t get presented with things by chefs that you would be tempted by. I know a number of chefs that have served the former President over the years. While he trends towards veganism and vegetarianism, it isn\u2019t totally exclusive. We\u2019ll just put it that way. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Photo courtesy of Walter Scheib \n \n What was it like the first day you started as a chef at the White House? \n \n My first day was so strange. The day of 9/11 was curious, the day that the administration changed over was strange too\u2014so there have been some days that I never imagined in my wildest dreams would play out\u2014but going to my first day at work and passing by 3,000 people that had lined up to walk around and check out the residence, getting my first phone call from the President or First Lady calling me by my first name, recognizing the fact that while it\u2019s just a bowl of oatmeal or a sandwich, it\u2019s going to the single most important person or another member of the family in the world \u2026 \n \n It really is a daunting proposition, knowing that there can be no mistakes. There can be no dilemmas where the President gets sick, you have to be very careful of things. Then, of course there\u2019s the honor of course of being like, who am I serving every day? And then learning the history of the house so that you can be an ambassador to the White House and to the First Family when visitors come. \n \n What was the screening and security process like, working in the White House every day? \n \n The clearance that you have when you\u2019re working in the White House is called Top Secret Presidential Proximity. \u201cTop secret\u201d is\u2014well, everyone knows what that is\u2014but the \u201cpresidential proximity\u201d part means that you can be in close physical contact with the President and the First Family with no Secret Service around you. Obviously, this is one of the most security-cleared posts you can get. In terms of the few of us that are in the kitchen who have that clearance, if you think about it, we\u2019re not just around outside and next to the President; we\u2019re physically inside of him. You really couldn\u2019t get any more close to that. In a way, you may be one of the singularly most trusted people in the whole country. \n \n That reminds me of a story that was circulating recently, that Obama got flak for allegedly turning down some food at an event because he didn\u2019t have his taster with him. \n \n Well, that\u2019s another urban myth. There are no tasters. The idea of a taster is a very Medieval one. If you wanted to poison someone these days, it could take up to a couple of weeks to even have an effect. Stuff takes on a life of its own, and for the most part, the White House doesn\u2019t follow up on it or deny it. They just let it fly. There are a number of people around the President who are aware of what\u2019s going on and who are aware of the protocols of what he eats and what he doesn\u2019t eat, but there would be no one who would say don\u2019t eat this or don\u2019t eat that. There are security protocols in place to protect him, but the idea of someone tasting all of his food before he tastes it is absurd. I am honestly very apolitical, but if you look at the outlets that were spreading that story it\u2019s fairly obvious why it was being spread. \n \n I think Mrs. Clinton had about 50 or 60 different hot sauces that she liked to use, and Mrs. Bush just had one that she liked, but she would use it on just about everything. \n \n One of your legacies is that you\u2019re said to have really distilled and advanced the concept of American cuisine while you were in the White House. What do you think are its fundamental, signature characteristics? \n \n Food is a representative of the culture of the country it\u2019s in and the people who are eating it. American food is a very clear representative\u2014by far\u2014of the most diverse and far-flung country that there is. I would characterize American food by three things: First, at its core, it\u2019s not about complicated or difficult technique, but about great, delicious, big, and full flavors. Secondly, there are regional influences. This idea of big flavors really circulated in the mid-70s and suddenly you saw all of these regional cuisines popping up, whether it was Alice Waters out in California, or Mark Miller down in the Southwest, or Tom Douglas up in the Northwest. And the third play is the ethnic one. \n \n You don\u2019t sound old enough to have been dining out in the 70s or early 80s [Ed. note: I\u2019m not], but in those days, you\u2019d say \u201cWe\u2019re going out for Chinese,\u201d which was some sort of amorphous Eastern type of food, or \u201cWe\u2019re going for French,\u201d which was some sort of cream-sauced, overly done, tuxedo-clad cuisine, or \u201cWe\u2019re going for Italian\u201d which was some sort of pasta with red sauce, or pizza. And that was about it. These days, you can walk down the street of any medium-sized city and see ten or 12 different Asian cuisines represented, half a dozen Italian styles, another ten or 12 European styles, South American cuisine, you name it. In America, there\u2019s no orthodoxy. You can cook whatever or however you want, and if the food is good, people will find you and they\u2019ll eat it. \n \n Bush and Clinton were both known to love rich, Southwestern types of foods. How would you compare their diets to one another? \n \n Food at the White House didn\u2019t delineate along party lines, but it delineated very closely along gender lines. Both of the First Ladies had very eclectic palates, always wanting to try new and different things all the time. Mrs. Clinton, like Michelle Obama, was very interested in the nutritional components of food and a healthy lifestyle. It\u2019s not well-known, but Mrs. Bush was adamant that as often as possible we would use organic food at the White House table. She was in Austin, apparently, when the concept of Whole Foods was coming up and really bought into the idea of organics. And they both liked spicy food. I think Mrs. Clinton had about 50 or 60 different hot sauces that she bought and liked to use, and Mrs. Bush just had one that she liked, but she would use it on just about everything, so the effect was the same. Cooking for the Presidents, I think they would have been just as happy if we had opened a barbecue pit or a burger joint in the basement. You can see that President Obama continues this trend. While his wife is a representative for responsible dining and regional food, every time you see the President he\u2019s eating a triple cheeseburger with a side of fries wherever he is that particular. It seems Presidents are still eating their stereotypical guy food, while First Ladies are laboring to try to get people to dine responsibly. \n \n But both presidents that I worked for like Southwestern\u2014one\u2019s from Texas, one\u2019s from Arkansas. But the real dichotomy you\u2019re talking about is barbecue. If I had to pick a national dish, people always say it\u2019s apple pie or hot dogs\u2014it\u2019s not. It\u2019s barbecue! Barbecue is in every region in the country and there are many different takes on it. And when you\u2019ve get a Texan and an Arkansan, the Texan will tell you that barbecue was beef brisket dry-rubbed and hot-cooked over a fire, and then sliced with a sauce on the side. But an Arkansan will tell you that it\u2019s a slow-cooked, wet-cooked, pulled and sauced pork. Both of them will tell you very distinctly that the other one isn\u2019t really barbecue. \n \n Did you feel like there was a difference in the foods that Presidents ate during the more difficult times: the wars and tragedies and scandals? \n \n Whether it was scandals, horrible occurrences, wars, or things not going as planned, clearly you see them in very pressured moments, both good times and bad times. Part of being the White House chef is being aware of what mood the house is in and what\u2019s appropriate for the time\u2014what kind of food should you be serving? I noticed right after 9/11\u2014when I was looking back through all of my recipes for my book\u2014that without any prompting, all of the food changed from being very eclectic and very forward-thinking, to going back into very safe food. Your mother\u2019s table, if you will. I think the country was very confused about what was going on and everyone wanted to grab onto an anchor, and in this case, that was food. I\u2019m doing research for a book I\u2019m working on right now, but I think that maybe this slow food, locavore movement going on right now can really find its genesis back in the weeks and months post-9/11, as people were shying away from this very flamboyant cuisine and wanting something more soul-satisfying. \n \n Click here to read Confessions of a White House Chef, Part Two. ||||| Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Body of former White House chef found in New Mexico 0:22 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n Search teams in New Mexico recovered the body late Sunday of a missing former White House chef who was last seen setting off for a solo hike in the mountains near Taos last weekend, New Mexico State Police said. \n \n Walter Scheib, 61, went hiking in the area on June 13 and never returned home.

Scheib went for a solo hike in the mountains last weekend and never returned, sparking a huge search effort involving aircraft, dogs, and National Guard teams, NBC News reports. Police say rescue teams are still gathering information on his death. Scheib, author of White House Chef: Eleven Years, Two Presidents, One Kitchen, was hired by Hillary Clinton in 1994 to give daily meals and state dinners a distinctive American twist, and was asked to resign in 2005, during the George W.

His girlfriend reported him missing the next day. Taos police found his vehicle Tuesday parked at a canyon trailhead. Scheib, who has two sons, served as the executive chef in the executive mansion for 11 years. He was hired in 1994 by former first lady Hillary Clinton to infuse a distinctly modern American flair into 1600 Penn. In 2005, after more than a decade and two administrations, Scheib was asked to resign. According to the book The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House, Scheib taught a teenage Chelsea Clinton to cook. After leaving the White House, Scheib started his own private chef business and co-authored a book, White House Chef: Eleven Years, Two Presidents, One Kitchen. \"The search has been a little slow-going because of the terrain, but it is ongoing,\" said New Mexico state police spokeswoman Sgt.

    "document": "(CNN) -- Two-time Oscar winner Tom Hanks played a role in the surprise ending of a domestic assault case in Los Angeles, according to defense attorney Andrew Flier. \n \n Hanks had been serving as a juror in the trial since it started last week. Flier's client was facing up to a year in jail and the attorney was prepared to offer closing arguments in the case on Wednesday. \n \n Instead, as proceedings wrapped Tuesday, the prosecuting attorney revealed that another lawyer in the Los Angeles City Attorney's Office had interacted with Hanks outside the courtroom, thanking him for his service. \n \n As a result, Flier asked the court for a mistrial, citing prosecutorial misconduct. In a hearing on Wednesday morning, lawyers on both sides of the case convened and settled on a reduced charge for the defendant: disturbing the peace and a $150 fine. \n \n City Attorney's Office spokesperson Frank Mateljan confirmed the interaction with Hanks, saying, \"The city attorney has been appraised of the situation and will be reviewing it.\" \n \n CNN reached out to representatives for Hanks for comment, but has not heard back. \n \n The alleged victim's reaction to the resolution was unavailable. Prosecutors do not identify those who makes claims of domestic violence, and the parties involved have made no public statement, Mateljan said. \n \n Flier said he was initially concerned that having a Hollywood star on the jury would unfairly influence the case's outcome. \n \n \"I think because of his celebrity status and because of his personality, I think (the jury) would have followed him.\" \n \n But after interviewing Hanks in jury selection, Flier decided he was a good fit for the final slot on the jury. \n \n \"He never looked or made any statements like he wanted to get off jury duty. So based on everything, he seemed like a very fair juror,\" Flier said. \n \n Hanks' appearance didn't only affect proceedings inside the courtroom. Flier said the star also drew quite a crowd of photographers and fans outside the courthouse afterward. \n \n \"Everyone was taking photographs. He was smiling. He welcomed anybody,\" Flier said. \n \n If the case hadn't ended in a plea, Flier said he doesn't know how Hanks would have voted. \n \n \"He looked at me like he always had, smiled and said, 'I was going to vote the way of justice.'

    "document": "The news for CNN has been bad for a long time, but it got especially bad in the second quarter of this year. Ratings for the network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s prime-time shows plunged by 40 percent from a year ago, and the network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance was its worst ever for a second quarter. \n \n CNN ties this to bad news \u00e2\u20ac\u201d or no news really \u00e2\u20ac\u201d because a year ago several breaking events during the quarter enhanced the network\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ratings, while this year the three-month period was relatively quiet. \n \n And all three cable news networks experienced declines in the second quarter among the viewers who matter to news advertisers, those from the ages of 25 to 54.\u00c2 MSNBC was down by 18 percent and Fox News down by 14 percent, while CNN\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s decline was more than double those figures. \n \n After its worst-ever May, and now a worst-ever quarter, the litany of \u201cworst evers\u201d is growing at CNN, which has yet to find an answer to what to do when news is light. The network still steers clear of the opinion-oriented programs that bring regular streams of viewers to hosts like Bill O\u00e2\u20ac\u2122Reilly and Sean Hannity on Fox and Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. \n \n Another worst ever for CNN was the rating from the Piers Morgan show at 9 p.m, which was down 32 percent from a year ago, to just 137,000 viewers in the 25-54 group. CNN has never before had a 9 p.m. show do that badly for a quarter. \n \n The figures for those 25-54 year-old viewers went like this: \n \n For its Monday through Friday prime time, CNN averaged 142,000 viewers, down from 236,000 a year ago. MSNBC averaged 227,000, down from 278,000 in 2011. Fox News, while posting its worst quarter in that ad-preferred group since the second quarter of 2008, still led easily with 438,000, down from 508,000 a year ago. \n \n In terms of total viewers, the Fox advantage, as always, was much greater. It averaged 2.14 million viewers, about flat with last year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 2.15 million. MSNBC averaged 817,000, down 12 percent from 926,000 in 2011. Again CNN had by far the biggest decline, with just 470,000 total viewers, only a little better than half of what MSNBC scored, and only about a fifth as much as the Fox News number. The CNN number was down 35 percent, from 727,000 viewers for the same quarter a year ago. \n \n CNN is highlighting some increases so far in June, with Anderson Cooper\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s show up 5 percent and Mr. Morgan\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s show up 9 percent. \n \n CNN reacted to the ratings news with an official e-mail comment from the network: \u00e2\u20ac\u015bAs a news organization our ratings reflect the news environment much more so than the other networks. That said, we always want higher ratings but not at the expense of nonpartisan, quality journalism.\u00e2\u20ac\u0165 ||||| In April, as Republicans were throwing their weight behind Mitt Romney and the lengthy, combative presidential primary process was drawing to a close, CNN\u2019s senior vice president and Washington bureau chief Sam Feist presented his staff with a \u201cCNN Half-time Election Report.\u201d \n \n The four-minute video, shown at the quarterly staff meeting, was a highlight reel of CNN debates, primary night coverage, and interviews interspersed with laudatory reviews. CNN, the video reminded its staff, had hosted more debates than any other network and landed some of the most significant interviews in the election cycle. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n \u201cAnd It\u2019s Only Halftime\u2026\u201d the video concluded. \n \n In fact, the scoreboard, according to many inside and outside the network, doesn\u2019t look nearly as good as the video suggests. \n \n CNN, the founder of the cable news genre, is now registering its lowest ratings since the first Gulf War. In the second quarter of 2012, the network attracted fewer viewers than at any time in the past 21 years, it was reported Tuesday. An average of 446,000 people now watch CNN\u2019s primetime programming while a mere 319,000 watch its daytime programming \u2014 declines from 2011 that are at least twice as severe as those suffered at Fox News and MSNBC. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Contempt battle explodes on CNN) \n \n Primetime programming is described by media insiders and academics as lackluster and stale. Several staffers at the network complain of low morale and an absence of editorial leadership. Earlier this month \u2014 in a further sign that all is not well \u2014 the network announced that it intended to cancel poorly rated politics show \u201cJohn King USA.\u201d \n \n One former executive said CNN faces an \u201cidentity crisis.\u201d \n \n While CNN struggles to make 24-hour news compelling, its competitors at Fox News and MSNBC have redefined the industry. They eschewed traditional, straight-forward newsgathering in favor of partisan, personality driven analysis \u2014 a model that is increasingly successful in an era of hyperpartisan politics, but one that CNN has resisted even as its ratings continue their slow and steady decline. \n \n There is now, according to industry experts, a very real possibility that without a coherent strategy, the only nonpartisan network left on cable could become largely irrelevant to the national conversation. \n \n \u201cNews has become much more personality driven and much more opinionated since CNN launched 32 years ago, and CNN has had difficulty moving in that direction,\u201d Brad Adgate, senior vice president of research at Horizon Media, told POLITICO. \u201cThey move in fits and starts, and they don\u2019t do a very good job of it.\u201d ||||| Coming off its least-watched month in primetime in 20 years in May, CNN has taken another big ratings blow: The cable news network has registered to its lowest-rated quarter in primetime since 1991. For this year\u2019s second quarter, CNN hit a low among total viewers and the key adults 25-54 demographic, with all primetime programs posting steep declines. The network averaged 446,000 total viewers and 129,000 in the 25-54 demo in primetime. Compared to last year\u2019s second quarter, that\u2019s down 35% and 41%, respectively. Rival Fox New Channel, meanwhile, with 1.79 million primetime total viewers on average, was down 1% from its 2011 second-quarter numbers. FNC lost 14% in the 25-54, bringing in 355,000 viewers. MSNBC was down 13% in total primetime viewers, with 689,000 on average, and down 17% in the 25-54 with 217,000. The quarter ran March 26-June 22. \n \n Individually, CNN shows hemorrhaged viewers heavily compared with last year.

The network had its lowest-rated quarter in 21 years (since 1991) in primetime, and in 11 years (since 2001) in Total Day. \n \n The ratings for Q2 2012: \n \n Primetime (Mon-Sun): 446,000 Total Viewers / 129,000 A25-54 \n \n 446,000 Total Viewers / 129,000 A25-54 Total Day (Mon-Sun): 319,000 Total Viewers / 95,000 A25-54 \n \n In Total Day, the network is down -35% in Total Viewers and -45% in the A25-54 demo. In primetime, CNN is down -35% in Total Viewers and -41% in the demographic. It is worth noting that Q2 2011 had several notable news events that boosted cable news ratings, including the death of Osama Bin Laden and the Royal Wedding. \n \n \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d is down -33% in Total Viewers and -45% in the demo since last year, when John King was the 7pmET anchor. \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u2033 at 8pmET is down -19% in Total Viewers and -23% in the demo compared to last year, when \u201cIn the Arena with Eliot Spitzer\u201d aired in the timeslot. \u201cPiers Morgan Tonight\u201d is down -29% and -33%, respectively. \n \n There is some good news for CNN in the form of monthly ratings. Compared to May 2012, which marked a 20-year ratings low for the network, CNN has grown +8% in Total Day and +6% in M-F primetime in June. Individual primetime programs have grown among younger viewers: Burnett\u2019s program is up +24%, while Cooper\u2019s is up +5% and Morgan is up +9% for the month.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 CNN's glory days are unquestionably behind it. Want proof? Q2 of 2012 clocked in as its lowest-rated quarter in 21 years. In fairness, Deadline notes that all three cable news networks reported a dip, but when you stack up the numbers, things looks pretty gloomy for the network: It averaged 446,000 total primetime viewers to Fox News' 1.79 million; even MSNBC eked out 689,000. Not even the dashing Anderson Cooper could save the day\u2014his show reeled in 19% fewer viewers. On the heels of the dour numbers, the media weighs in: TVNewser tempers CNN's 35% drop in primetime viewers year over year, pointing out that Q2 of 2011 was a biggie: Osama bin Laden was killed and Kate and Wills tied the knot. (By comparison, Fox News was down 1%; MSNBC, 13%.) And a big part of the network's problem, posits the New York Times, is its avoidance of hyperpartisan analysis, which helps fill in the gaps when there's just not much going on. It \"has yet to find an answer to what to do when news is light,\" writes Bill Carter. Politico goes behind the scenes, talking to staffers and former execs who report that morale is low and cite a lack of editorial leadership. \"It\u2019s frustrating to hear our leadership talk about the exemplary journalism we do, then turn on the TV during the day and see CNN doing another story about 'birthers' or 'tips for dining out alone,'\" said one staffer, complaining about the lack of strategy. But one senior VP tells Politico that isn't so, saying its \"clear\" editorial direction rests upon \"worldwide newsgathering and reporting a broad range of stories without picking sides.\" Still, Dylan Byers writes that \"Cooper, once known for intrepid reports from disaster zones, now makes his most notable contributions to the following day\u2019s news with a humor segment called 'The RidicuList.'\"",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 CNN's prime-time viewership has sunk to its lowest level since the first Gulf War, according to new ratings. The network's average of 446,000 viewers in the second quarter is down 35% from a year ago, and it was CNN's worst performance ever for a second quarter, the New York Times reports. MSNBC and Fox News were down by 18% and 14%, respectively, while CNN's decline was more than twice that of the other two networks. CNN's prime-time programming still shies away from opinion-oriented programs, and Piers Morgan's show at 9pm was the network's worst ever, with 137,000 viewers in the 25- to 54-year-old demographic. \"After its worst-ever May, and now a worst-ever quarter, the litany of 'worst evers' is growing at CNN, which has yet to find an answer to what to do when news is light,\" writes the Times' Brian Stelter. \"The network still steers clear of the opinion-oriented programs that bring regular streams of viewers to hosts like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity on Fox and Rachel Maddow on MSNBC,\" he writes. \"There is now, according to industry experts, a very real possibility that without a coherent strategy, the only nonpartisan network left on cable could become largely irrelevant.\"",

    "document": "Andy Roddick has announced he will retire from the sport of tennis after the US Open. The announcement comes on Roddick's 30th birthday. The tournament's official Twitter account tweeted: \n \n The Daily Mail had the following from Roddick, who stated he had a pretty good idea earlier this summer following his last loss at Wimbledon: \n \n I've always, whatever my faults have been, I felt like I've never done anything halfway. It's probably the first time in my career that I can sit here and say I'm not sure that I can put everything into it physically and emotionally. I don't know that I want to disrespect the game by coasting home. I had plans to play a smaller schedule next year. But the more I thought about it, I think you've either got to be all in or not. \n \n Roddick, who cruised to a straight-sets victory over Rhyne Williams in the first round on Tuesday, faces Australia's Bernard Tomic next. \n \n Roddick has a career 610-212 record, including 32 singles titles, and career prize money of more than $20 million. He won the 2003 US Open, beating Juan Carlos Ferrero in the finals. No North American male tennis player has yet to win a Grand Slam singles title since. ||||| NEW YORK \u2013 Andy Roddick played on his own terms. \n \n No surprise, then, that the USA's best player for the last decade will leave the sport on those same conditions \u2014 though the announcement Thursday at the U.S. Open caught many off guard. \n \n \"I'll make this short and sweet,\" Roddick told a packed room of reporters on his 30th birthday. \"I've decided that this is going to be my last tournament.\" \n \n \"I just feel like it's time,\" said Roddick, the last American man to win a major at the 2003 U.S. Open. \"I don't know that I'm healthy enough or committed enough to go another year.\" \n \n Don't write his farewell just yet. \n \n The No. 20 seed faces 19-year-old Bernard Tomic of Australia in a second-round match on Arthur Ashe Stadium on Friday night. It should be a rocking house. \n \n \"I wanted an opportunity to say goodbye,\" Roddick said of his decision to reveal his intentions mid-tournament. \"I hope I'm sticking around.\" \n \n Roddick showed his usual poking, joking and sharply reflective sides. \n \n \"If I do run into some emotions tomorrow or in four days, I don't want people to think I'm a little unstable,\" he quipped. \"Or more unstable.\" \n \n He recounted his first visit to the U.S Open as a kid with his parents on his 8th birthday and sneaking into the players' lounge. He talked about the ups and downs in Flushing Meadows and his satisfaction that he had left it all out on court during his career. \n \n But plagued by injuries, he said he didn't feel like he could compete at the top level anymore. That, for him, was retirement. \n \n \"Probably the first time in my career that I can sit here and say I'm not sure that I can put everything into it physically and emotionally,\" he said. \"I don't know that I want to disrespect the game by coasting home.\" \n \n There were signs the former No. 1 was mulling his future. \n \n At Wimbledon after a third-round loss to David Ferrer, he uncharacteristically waved to the crowd and blew a kiss. \n \n He refused to say if it was a gesture of finality, but on Thursday he admitted: \"Walking off at Wimbledon, I felt like I knew,\" he said. \n \n The feeling returned after his first-round win against American qualifier Rhyne Williams Tuesday. \n \n \"It's something he's thought about a lot over the last six months,\" said his coach since December 2008, Larry Stefanki. \"When he walked on the court his mind was wandering, and he knew.\" \n \n Roddick had battled injuries the last two years and the constant physical breakdowns wore him down, Stefanki added. \n \n Stefanki, who has coached a number of No. 1s, said Roddick's best qualities were his competitiveness, determination and work ethic. \n \n \"He was very coachable, more so away from the court,\" Stefanki said. \n \n Roddick won the U.S. Open juniors in 2000 and soon the brash-talking, big hitting Nebraska native was rising the ranks and showing off a quick-step firepower on serve few had encountered before. \n \n He smoothly accepted the celebrated baton from American greats Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras, who played in the 2002 U.S. Open final won by Sampras. \n \n A year later Roddick beat Juan Carlos Ferrero of Spain in the U.S. Open final and finished the year atop the rankings. \n \n Sampras waited a year and retired after that match, while Agassi played on until 2006. But it was clear by mid-decade it was Roddick's show \u2014 and he put on a good one. \n \n He battled the likes of Marat Safin, Lleyton Hewitt, Rafael Nadal and mostly Roger Federer, his longtime nemesis. Federer beat him in the 2006 U.S. Open final and three more times at Wimbledon (2004-05, '09), the last a 16-14 fifth-set defeat. \n \n The loss was devastating, but public appreciation for the no-nonsense, hardworking Roddick reached a new high. \n \n \"At the end of the day, I know that people view it as a career \u2026 of some hard knocks,\" he said. \"But I got to play. I got to play in a crowd, play in Wimbledon finals, be the guy on a Davis Cup team for a while. Those are opportunities not a lot of people get. As much as I was disappointed and frustrated at times, I'm not sure that I ever felt sorry for myself or begrudged anybody any of their success.\" \n \n Roddick said he was proud he kept his nose to the grindstone while others faded in and out, and squeezed as much out of his talent as possible. \n \n \"In my mind he's a Wimbledon champion,\" said Roger Federer, who defeated Roddick in three Wimbledon finals, after his 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 victory against Bjorn Phau. \n \n Along the way, he mentored up-and-coming players such as Sam Querrey and Ryan Harrison, kept the press busy with his witty retorts and willingly served as the face of American tennis. \n \n \"Not only was he a great team player, he was a leader,\" former U.S. Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe said on ESPN2. \n \n \"We're losing the best champion we've had in America the last 10-15 years,\" said James Blake Thursday after beating Marcel Granollers 6-1, 6-4, 6-2. \n \n Roddick had an edge. He got ticked off, he lost it at times, he didn't always treat umpires with respect. But he was always honest. \n \n Detractors will point to the obvious \u2014 Roddick will likely finish up his career with one Grand Slam title. \n \n But the body of work is hall-of-fame worthy: four other major finals, the year-end No. 1 ranking (2003), a Davis Cup championship (2007), nine consecutive years in the top 10 (2001-2009) and 12 years running with at least one ATP Tour title. \n \n \"He's had an incredible career,\" said 20-year-old Harrison. \"He's been a huge influence on my career, been a great friend, an incredible mentor. He's going to do great things even when he's done with tennis.\" \n \n Roddick said he would be plenty busy with his philanthropic foundation, which is building a youth tennis center in Austin; his part-time radio work; and family life with his wife, actress and model Brooklyn Decker. \n \n Roddick said his rackets weren't likely to collect dust. \n \n \"I don't think I'm one of the guys who won't pick up a racket for three years,\" he said. \"I still love the innocent parts of the game. I love hitting tennis balls. I love seeing the young guys do well.\" \n \n New York will have one more chance to see him do well, too. \n \n \"It's the most electric atmosphere in our sport,\" he said of night matches on Ashe stadium. \n \n Fasten up for some voltage.",

Like the previous plans, the new one sought to undermine the Affordable Care Act, this time by delaying enforcement of the \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d a cornerstone of the law that requires all Americans to obtain health insurance. \n \n The new measure also sought to strip lawmakers and their aides of long-standing government health benefits. \n \n The Democratic-led Senate quickly rejected that plan on a party-line vote. Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) urged House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) to abandon the assault on the health-care law and pass a simple bill to keep the government open. Otherwise, Reid warned, \u201cthe responsibility for this Republican government shutdown will rest squarely on his shoulders.\u201d \n \n Boehner refused to yield. He instead won approval, in a 1 a.m. largely party-line roll call, requesting a special House-Senate committee to meet in the coming days to resolve differences between the two parties, leaving in limbo the fate of millions of federal workers and the services they provide. \n \n Shortly before midnight, the White House budget office issued a memo instructing agencies to \u201cexecute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations.\u201d \n \n The impasse means 800,000 federal workers will be furloughed Tuesday. National parks, monuments and museums, as well as most federal offices, will close. Tens of thousands of air-traffic controllers, prison guards and Border Patrol agents will be required to serve, but their pay may be delayed. And many congressional hearings \u2014 including one scheduled for Tuesday on last month\u2019s Washington Navy Yard shootings \u2014 will be postponed. \n \n In a last-minute ray of hope for active-duty troops, Congress on Monday approved and sent to the White House an agreement to keep issuing military paychecks. But Obama warned that the broader economy, which is finally starting to recover from the shocks of the past six years, would take a substantial hit if congressional gridlock shutters \u201cAmerica\u2019s largest employer.\u201d \n \n \u201cKeeping the people\u2019s government open is not a concession to me. Keeping vital services running and hundreds of thousands of Americans on the job is not something you \u2018give\u2019 to the other side. It\u2019s our basic responsibility,\u201d Obama said in a statement Monday evening at the White House. \n \n Privately, senior Republicans predicted that the closure would last at least a week. A fraction of today\u2019s House Republicans were on Capitol Hill in 1995 and 1996 when a Republican-led Congress last shut down the government in a dispute over the budget with a Democratic president. Younger lawmakers don\u2019t remember the pain the shutdown caused constituents, senior Republicans said. And many of them now question the conventional wisdom that the closures weakened the GOP presidential candidate in 1996 and nearly cost the party control of the House. \n \n Democrats predicted that if the shutdown stretches into the weekend, the government-funding dispute could be rolled into an even more serious battle over the $16.7 trillion federal debt limit. The Treasury Department will begin running short of cash to pay the nation\u2019s bills as soon as Oct. 17 unless Congress approves additional borrowing authority. With so little time remaining to avoid what would be the nation\u2019s first default, Democratic aides predicted that negotiations to reopen the government may be merged into the debt-limit talks. \n \n On Monday evening, Obama telephoned Boehner to urge him to reconsider his stance on the health-care law. In a call that lasted nearly 10 minutes, according to Boehner\u2019s office, the president reiterated his insistence that there would be no negotiations over the debt limit, and that Congress must pay the bills it has incurred. \n \n Boehner responded by mocking Obama in a speech on the House floor. \n \n \u201c \u2018I\u2019m not going to negotiate,\u2019 \u201d he said, quoting Obama. \u201cI would say to the president: This is not about me. It\u2019s not about Republicans here in Congress. It\u2019s about fairness.\u201d \n \n The speech drew applause for the embattled speaker, who argued passionately that Republicans were merely seeking \u201cfairness\u201d for working people. Obama has delayed a mandate for employers to insure workers and delayed other requirements for big unions, Boehner said. \u201cYet they stick our constituents with a bill they don\u2019t like and a bill they can\u2019t afford,\u201d he said. \n \n Despite the show of unity, Republicans on both sides of the Capitol remain deeply divided about the attack on the health-care law. In the House, a group of more moderate Republicans was seething about the decision to bow to the forces that oppose the Affordable Care Act, led by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) and his allies on the right, including such outside groups as Heritage Action for America. \n \n On Monday, some publicly urged Boehner to drop the issue and seek the help of House Democrats to pass the simple government-funding bill that the Senate approved last week. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t want to shut down the government,\u201d said Rep. Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), who is trying to become her state\u2019s first GOP senator since the 1950s, adding that she was inclined to support a \u201cclean\u201d funding bill. \n \n Frustrations also were simmering among Senate Republicans, who complained that House leaders were pressing the attack in direct opposition to public opinion. Polls show that voters overwhelmingly disapprove of using the threat of a shutdown to defund the health-care law and that blame for a shutdown will fall squarely on Republicans. \n \n \u201cBy wanting to repeal Obamacare using this method, it defies what the popular will is,\u201d said Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, who campaigned last year on behalf of his party\u2019s national ticket. \n \n \u201cI campaigned in 2012 all over this country for months: \u2018Repeal and replace Obamacare.\u2019 That was not the mandate of the voters,\u201d McCain said. \u201cIf they wanted to repeal Obamacare, the 2012 election would have been probably significantly different.\u201d \n \n Adding to the tension Monday was Boehner\u2019s decision to add the provision that would strip lawmakers, congressional staff members and White House aides of the employer subsidies for health insurance they have received for many years. \n \n Now that lawmakers and their aides must join the new health-insurance exchanges, some conservative groups have criticized the subsidies, worth about $5,000 a year for individual coverage and $10,000 for families, as a \u201cspecial exemption\u201d from the new law. By including the provision, House leaders hoped to attract conservative support and put pressure on Senate Democrats, who faced the choice of shutting down the government to protect their own perks. \n \n \u201cOn what flooding peninsula can you stand when it\u2019s a question of delaying the individual mandate, ending member subsidies and funding the government?\u201d said Rep. Peter Roskam (R-Ill.). If Reid kills it, \u201cthe senators he\u2019s going to protect become the subject of incredible scrutiny.\u201d \n \n Even some Republicans were uneasy about the prospect of dealing their aides \u2014 and some of their colleagues \u2014 the equivalent of a big pay cut. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) called it an \u201coutrage,\u201d adding that Boehner had worked directly with Reid and the Obama administration to make sure the subsidies would stay in place when congressional employees join the exchanges next year. \n \n Boehner and his team presented the proposal to rank-and-file Republicans in a closed-door meeting Monday. For more than an hour and a half, lawmakers argued about the plan. They emerged with an unusual number of public dissenters, including Rep. Peter T. King (N.Y.), one of a dozen Republicans who ultimately voted against the proposal. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t want to be the facilitator of a disastrous process and plan,\u201d he said. \n \n Still, most Republicans endorsed the deal, even if somewhat reluctantly. \u201cI think this is a principled call by leadership and it has the support of the con\u00adference,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), one of Boehner\u2019s closest friends. \n \n Democrats, meanwhile, were united against any attempt by Republicans to extract concessions now, especially with the larger fight over the debt limit swiftly approaching. \n \n \u201cThe bottom line is very simple,\u201d said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). \u201cYou negotiate on this, they will up the ante for the debt limit.\u201d \n \n Ed O\u2019Keefe, Rosalind S. Helderman, Jackie Kucinich and Jeff Simon contributed to this report. ||||| NASA \n \n Tomorrow, October 1, is our nation's space agency's 55th birthday. To celebrate, NASA employees can, well, do whatever they want, just as long as they don't do their jobs. \n \n NASA, as President Obama put it in his afternoon remarks, will \"shut down almost entirely\" if a faction of congressional Republicans succeeds in preventing a clean continuing resolution to keep the government open from coming to the House floor for a vote. \n \n According to The Washington Post, just 549 of NASA's 18,250 employees will be expected to work if the government shuts down. The remainder -- 17,701 people -- will be furloughed.* \n \n A memo from Elizabeth Robinson, NASA's CFO, outlines which operations will continue: \n \n There are two major operations or classes of operations that would require ongoing support in accordance with the definitions of excepted activities identified above. First NASA currently is operating the ISS with a crew of 6 astronauts/cosmonauts, which has been in continuous operation since 1998. To protect the life of the crew as well as the assets themselves, we would continue to support planned operations of the ISS during any funding hiatus. Moreover, NASA will be closely monitoring the impact of an extended shutdown to determine if crew transportation or cargo resupply services are required to mitigate imminent threats to life and property on the ISS or other areas. Second, if a satellite mission is in the operations phase, we will maintain operations that are essential to ensure the safety of that satellite and the data received from it. However if a satellite mission has not yet been launched, work will generally cease on that project. \n \n To those 549 people, the 549 people who must keep our satellites up and running and keep our astronauts safe from harm, we salute you. Good luck in your lonely offices. \n \n *Correction: An earlier version of this article quoted from an International Business Times report which said the Curiosity would be put in a sleep mode during the shutdown. The IBT has since corrected its original story: ||||| But 57 minutes later, and with almost no debate, the Senate killed the House health care provisions and sent the stopgap spending bill right back, free of policy prescriptions. Earlier in the day, the Senate had taken less than 25 minutes to convene and dispose of a weekend budget proposal by the House Republicans. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019ve lost their minds,\u201d Mr. Reid said, before disposing of the House bill. \u201cThey keep trying to do the same thing over and over again.\u201d \n \n The federal government was then left essentially to run out of money at midnight, the end of the fiscal year, although the president signed a measure late Monday that would allow members of the military to continue to be paid. \n \n \u201cYou don\u2019t get to extract a ransom for doing your job,\u201d Mr. Obama said in the White House briefing room as the clock ticked to midnight. \n \n Photo \n \n Mr. Obama called House Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, but they spoke for less than 10 minutes, without any sign of progress. \n \n \u201cI talked to the president tonight,\u201d the speaker said on the House floor. He summed up Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks as: \u201cI\u2019m not going to negotiate. I\u2019m not going to negotiate.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The House\u2019s most ardent conservatives were resigned to seeing through their war on the health care law to its inevitable conclusion, a shutdown that could test voters\u2019 patience with Republican brinkmanship. \n \n Cracks in the party were opening into fissures of frustration. \n \n \u201cYou have this group that keeps saying somehow if you\u2019re not with them, you\u2019re for Obamacare,\u201d said Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California. \u201cIf you\u2019re not with exactly their plan, exactly what they want to do, then you\u2019re somehow for Obamacare, and it\u2019s just getting a little old.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s moronic to shut down the government over this,\u201d he continued. \n \n It was far from certain that Republicans could remain unified on their insistence on health care concessions if a shutdown lasted for some time. Asked whether Republicans could hold together through the end of the week, Representative Phil Gingrey of Georgia, one of the more conservative members, answered: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d \n \n Photo \n \n Earlier Monday, the Senate voted 54 to 46 along party lines to kill the previous House plan immediately after ending a weekend break. Senators then sent the House a bill to finance the government through Nov. 15 without policy prescriptions. \n \n But House leaders would have none of it, again demanding a significant hit to the health law as a price for keeping the government open. \n \n Mr. Reid laid into Mr. Boehner and put the blame for a shutdown solely on his shoulders. \u201cOur negotiation is over with,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cYou know with a bully you cannot let them slap you around, because they slap you around today, they slap you five or six times tomorrow,\u201d Mr. Reid, a former boxer, continued. \u201cWe are not going to be bullied.\u201d \n \n In addition to criticizing Mr. Boehner, Mr. Reid excoriated what he called the \u201cbanana Republican mind-set\u201d of the House. He called on the speaker to put the Senate bill up for a vote, which would almost certainly pass in the House because of overwhelming Democratic support and backing from moderate Republicans. \n \n Photo \n \n In one of their final moves, House Republicans attached language to a government funding bill that would delay the mandate that individuals obtain health insurance and would force members of Congress, their staffs and White House staff members to buy their health insurance on the new exchanges without any government subsidies. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Conservative activists have portrayed the language as ensuring that Congress and the White House would be held to the same strictures that apply to ordinary Americans under the health care law. In fact, the language would put poorly paid junior staff members at a disadvantage. \n \n Most people buying coverage on the exchanges will receive subsidies through generous tax credits. Most Americans will still get their insurance from their employers, who will continue to receive a tax deduction for the cost of that care. Under the House language, lawmakers and their staffs, executive branch political appointees, the White House staff, and the president and vice president would have to pay the entire cost of health insurance out of pocket. \n \n Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York, said junior staff members were \u201cbeing used as a sacrifice\u201d for a political gambit, driven by Republican hard-liners in the Senate like Ted Cruz of Texas, that will go nowhere. \n \n \u201cThey locked themselves into this situation, the dead end that Ted Cruz created,\u201d Mr. King said. \n \n The budget confrontation \u2014 which threatened to close federal offices and facilities, idling thousands of workers around the country \u2014 stemmed from an unusual push by Republicans to undo a law that has been on the books for three years, through a presidential election, and that the Supreme Court largely upheld in 2012. A major part of the law is set to take effect Tuesday: the opening of insurance exchanges, where people without insurance will be able to obtain coverage. \n \n Republicans argue that the administration has itself delayed elements of the law. They say it should be postponed for at least a year. \n \n Democrats say Republicans are being driven by the most extreme elements of their party to use the federal budget to extract concessions on health care that they could not win through the traditional legislative process. \u201cThe scary thing about the period we\u2019re in right now is there is no clear end,\u201d said Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland. ||||| A list of key questions and answers from Washington Post coverage of the likely effects on federal government employees. Live updates: The shutdown showdown \n \n When will I know if I'll be furloughed due to the shutdown? \n \n Federal workers will get an e-mail or phone call from their supervisors by Monday telling them to report for work or remain at home. \n \n Those who would not be working would get a few hours Tuesday morning to come into the office to secure their files, send e-mails and put things in order before signing off. It would be illegal for them to conduct any work until they were called back to their jobs. \n \n - Read more from Lisa Rein \n \n Who is \"exempt\" and who's not? \n \n That's up to individual agencies. A recent OMB memo told them to review plans they made in 2011. The federal government is required by law to maintain functions that: \n \n - provide for the national security, including the conduct of foreign relations; \n \n - provide for benefit payments and the performance of contract obligations under no-year or multi-year contracts; and \n \n - protect life and property. \n \n - Read more from Eric Yoder \n \n Who decides? \n \n Federal managers must review which of their employees would be excepted or exempted and required to come to work, and which would be non-excepted or non-exempted and sent home during a shutdown. \n \n - Read more from Lisa Rein and Eric Yoder \n \n How many workers will be affected? \n \n A government shutdown this week would jeopardize the paychecks of more than 800,000 federal workers who could be told to stay home. The federal government has more than 2 million employees. Those workers who remain on the job as well as active military would be entitled to their salaries, but might not be paid on time. \n \n - Read more from Lisa Rein \n \n Will I be paid? \n \n A recent Office of Management and Budget memo says much the same: \"Without further specific direction or enactment by Congress, all excepted employees are entitled to receive payment for obligations incurred by their agencies for their performance of excepted work during the period of the appropriations lapse,\" the memo says. \"After appropriations are enacted, payroll centers will pay all excepted employees for time worked.\" \n \n The OMB memo did not directly address pay for \"non-exempt\" employees. The OPM guidance says that \"Congress will determine whether furloughed employees receive pay for the furlough period.\" \n \n - Read more from Eric Yoder \n \n If I am paid, will my paycheck be on time? \n \n Gregory Junemann, president of the International Federation of Professional & Technical Engineers, said the administration officials indicated that employees who are required to work would be paid \"eventually.\" \n \n \"They can't guarantee [the workers] will be paid on time,\" Junemann said. \"They are pretty comfortable with the statement that everybody who works will be paid eventually.\" Those furloughed might be paid, but Republicans could move to block that. \n \n - Read more from Joe Davidson \n \n If I'm furloughed, why can't I take annual leave or other paid time off instead? \n \n Because that would create a debt obligation to the government not payable under the Antideficiency Act if no appropriation has been made. This includes a requirement to cancel any paid leave that already had been scheduled. \n \n - Read more from Eric Yoder \n \n The OPM publication states that employees cannot substitute paid leave for furlough time and that even previously scheduled paid time off must be canceled \"because the requirement to furlough supersedes leave and other paid time off rights.\" \n \n - Read more from Eric Yoder \n \n How would a new plan offered by House Republicans affect me? \n \n The new plan, like those Republicans have pushed before, would increase employee contributions to their retirement benefits. \n \n The plan now under discussion apparently is like a bill that Republicans used their House majority to approve in December. Had it passed the Senate, the measure would have required federal workers to pay an additional 5 percent of salary over five years toward their retirement contributions, saving the government about $80 billion. \n \n - Read more from Joe Davidson \n \n How is this possible shutdown different from previous ones? \n \n Compared with the shutdowns of the 1990s, many more federal workers are in danger of being furloughed this year, because Congress has not passed a single funding bill. In the past, Congress had passed appropriations bills that funded various large agencies, including the Defense Department, meaning they could continue to operate even if other parts of the government could not. \n \n - Read more from Lisa Rein \n \n What if I'm a government contractor? \n \n Contractors said they assumed they would get little notice about whether their employees would go to work or not. And then, they would have to decide -- on a contract by contract basis -- what to do with those workers. \n \n - Read more from Marjorie Censer \n \n Will I be reimbursed for time missed? \n \n In past shutdowns, federal employees have been reimbursed for time missed, said Alan Chvotkin, counsel at the Professional Services Council, an industry group. But contractors have not fared as well. \n \n \"Contractors have never been reimbursed,\" Chvotkin said. A shutdown has been \"just lost revenue, lost salary to those affected.\" \n \n - Read more from Marjorie Censer \n \n While there is no law requiring that nonessential employees be compensated if they are ordered off the job, Congress has in the past voted to reimburse their losses once shutdowns ended. \n \n But this go-round could be different. The bitterly divided Congress includes many lawmakers who are unsympathetic to the plight of federal workers and could be loath to help them recoup their money. \n \n - Read more from Lisa Rein \n \n Will overseas military operations be affected? \n \n Defense Department spokesman George Little said overseas operations, including those in Afghanistan, would not be directly affected. \n \n - Read more from Lisa Rein \n \n What's the status of employee benefits? \n \n Coverage under the federal employee health insurance program will continue, with the employees' share accumulating until they return to paid status. Coverage under the life insurance program also continues, without cost to the employee. For the long-term care and vision/dental insurance programs, enrollees must continue to pay the premiums; those paying through payroll deduction will be billed directly if the unpaid period lasts a number of weeks. \n \n - Read more from Eric Yoder \n \n What if I'm deemed \"essential,\" but get sick? \n \n You might want to take steps to assure they are feeling well in addition to feeling good, because if you become too sick to work during a shutdown they would face the same uncertainty over their pay for the time off work as those who are furloughed. \n \n ... \n \n For example, the Navy has issued new guidance to its civilian employees warning that \"Excepted employees who are not able to work due to sick leave, jury duty, etc., must be placed in a furlough status (i.e., non-duty, non-pay) until they are able to return to duty.\" \n \n - Read more from Eric Yoder \n \n If I'm a retired federal worker, will I still get my check? \n \n For millions of federal retirees who may be concerned about their annuity checks, which arrive on the first day of each month, the Office of Personnel Management said they would be paid on Oct. 1 as normal. \n \n - Read more from Lisa Rein \n \n Federal retirement payments, like payments such as Social Security benefits, fall under the \"mandatory\" budget category not funded through annual appropriations and thus not affected by these kinds of funding deadlocks. According to the OPM document, federal retirees \"will still receive their scheduled annuity payments on the first business day of the month.\" \n \n - Read more from Eric Yoder \n \n What about other services to retirees, such as issues with missed payments or questions? \n \n OPM's Retirement Services office employees are excluded from the shutdown because that office gets its operating money from the federal retirement trust fund. The Retirement Information Office at 1-888-767-6738 is open. \n \n - Read more from Eric Yoder \n \n How does a shutdown end? \n \n It's up to Congress and the White House.

And if the spending standoff lasts into late October, veterans\u2019 benefit payments would trickle to a stop. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Shutdown news roundup VandeHei: It's going to get worse \n \n Unlike this year\u2019s across-the-board spending cuts that rarely lived up to the hype, Americans will notice soon enough that their government services have been disrupted \u2014 if not canceled. So, Monday will have been the day to get a last look at the National Zoo\u2019s panda cam. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a different kettle of fish when you say people aren\u2019t going to show up at all,\u201d said a former Clinton administration official central to planning for the last government shutdown in 1995 and 1996. \n \n (POLITICO's full government shutdown coverage) \n \n Appearing in the White House briefing room Monday just hours before the deadline, President Barack Obama assured Americans that air traffic controllers and federal prison guards would remain on the job. They will also still get their Social Security checks and Medicare help. But it won\u2019t be pretty either, he warned, especially for the federal workers who will be sent home without pay until there\u2019s an agreement on Capitol Hill. \n \n \u201cA shutdown will have a very real economic impact on real people right away,\u201d Obama said. \n \n So how exactly does the U.S. government close its doors? \n \n The official word won\u2019t come from the CNN countdown clock. It came via a guidance memo from White House Office of Management and Budget Director Sylvia Mathews Burwell \u2014 shortly before midnight Monday \u2014 instructing department heads to begin implementing their specific shutdown contingency plans. \n \n (WATCH: Shutdown: Democrats vs. Republicans) \n \n All federal employees should still show up for work Tuesday, where their managers will distribute the official notices on who is and isn\u2019t essential to daily operations. That\u2019s a tricky enough question \u2014 one loaded with both legal ramifications and a good bit of psychological baggage \u2014 but essentially boils down to the Cabinet secretaries and a skeleton operations crew who have jobs that involve protection of public safety or government property: think military troops, meat inspectors and border patrol. \n \n The furloughed workers will have until about lunchtime Tuesday to wrap up any last-minute business at their desks: securing files, cancelling meetings, conferences and trips, setting up their \u2018out-of-office\u2019 email replies and updating voice mail recordings to say they won\u2019t be back on the job until there\u2019s a budget agreement. \n \n Federal employees are also being told to track news sites for updates on when they can come back to work. And as for any other questions about the strict rules surrounding furloughs? Those can be answered by a handy Office of Personnel Management guidance document that describes frequently asked questions like prohibitions on voluntary government work and moonlighting. \n \n (WATCH: Boehner 'confident' House will pass CR) \n \n Some of the largest furloughs will hit the Pentagon and 400,000 of its civilian workers. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel fretted Monday about how these workers have been among those hit hard by sequestration \u2014 with a summer full of unpaid furlough days. Still, he said decisions to send them home without pay \u201care dictated solely by the law\u201d for protecting people and property. \n \n \u201cThe furloughs are in no way a reflection of the importance of your work, the hard effort you put forth every day, or your dedicated service to our department and our nation,\u201d Hagel said in a memo to Defense Department employees while traveling in South Korea. \n \n As for the uniformed troops, they too must report to work, though they\u2019ll have the benefit of receiving their pay thanks to a rare legislative agreement between the House and Senate. \n \n (PHOTOS: 17 times the government has shut down) \n \n The news isn\u2019t so good for veterans. Benefit checks from the Department of Veterans Affairs, including disability claim checks and pension payments, are expected to last only two or three weeks beyond the start of the shutdown. Assistance for veteran-run businesses also will cease, while rehabilitation and education counseling are likely to be limited. \n \n Some programs and government offices will remain open during the shutdown because they rely on mandatory spending or funding streams outside the annual congressional appropriations process. That\u2019s why it\u2019s full steam ahead for the Obamacare insurance exchanges \u2014 which coincidentally go live Tuesday \u2014 that are central to the Capitol Hill budget impasse. \n \n It\u2019s also why the U.S. Postal Service and Amtrak will continue operating, along with the Federal Highway Administration, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and some parts of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \u2014 all of which get funding from the federal fuel tax. \n \n Many others aren\u2019t so lucky. ||||| From New York's Liberty Island to Alaska's Denali National Park, the U.S. government closed its doors as a bitter budget fight idled hundreds of thousands of federal workers and halted all but the most critical government services for the first time in nearly two decades. \n \n National Park Service guide Terry Papavasilis talks with visitors about the Liberty Bell at Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia, Monday, Sept. 30, 2013 as the government teeters on the... (Associated Press) \n \n With hours to go until a possible government shutdown, visitors tour the Rotunda of the. Capitol in Washington, Monday, Sept. 30, 2013. Capitol officials said today that if a shutdown goes into effect,... (Associated Press) \n \n A midnight deadline to avert a shutdown passed amid Congressional bickering over whether to scale back President Barack Obama's health care reform law, casting in doubt Americans' ability to get government services ranging from federally-backed home loans to supplemental food assistance for children and pregnant women. \n \n For many employees of the federal government, the shutdown that began Tuesday meant no more paychecks as they were forced onto unpaid furloughs. For those still working, it meant delays in getting paid. \n \n Park Ranger and father-to-be Darquez Smith said he already lives paycheck-to-paycheck while putting himself through college. \n \n \"I've got a lot on my plate right now _ tuition, my daughter, bills,\" said Smith, 23, a ranger at Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park in Ohio. \"I'm just confused and waiting just like everyone else.\" \n \n The impact of the shutdown was mixed _ immediate and far-reaching for some, annoying but minimal for others. \n \n In Colorado, where flooding killed eight people earlier this month, emergency funds to help rebuild homes and businesses continued to flow _ but federal worker furloughs were expected to slow it down. \n \n National Guard soldiers rebuilding washed-out roads would apparently be paid on time _ along with the rest of the country's active-duty military personnel _ under a bill passed hours before the shutdown. Existing Social Security and Medicare benefits, veterans' services and mail delivery were also unaffected. \n \n Other agencies were harder hit _ nearly 3,000 Federal Aviation Administration safety inspectors were furloughed along with most of the National Transportation Safety Board's employees, including accident investigators who respond to air crashes, train collisions, pipeline explosions and other accidents. \n \n Almost all of NASA shut down, except for Mission Control in Houston, and national parks closed along with the Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo in Washington. Even the zoo's popular panda cam went dark, shut off for the first time since a cub was born there Aug. 23. \n \n As the shutdown loomed Monday, visitors to popular parks made their frustration with elected officials clear. \n \n \"There is no good thing going to come out of it,\" said Chris Fahl, a tourist from Roanoke, Indiana, visiting the Abraham Lincoln Birthplace National Historic Park in Hodgenville, Kentucky. \"Taxpayers are just going to be more overburdened.\" \n \n Emily Enfinger, visiting the Statue of Liberty, said politicians need to find a way to work together. \n \n \"They should be willing to compromise, both sides, and it discourages me that they don't seem to be able to do that,\" she said. \"They're not doing their job as far as I'm concerned.\" \n \n The shutdown was strangely captivating to Marlena Knight, an Australian visiting Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia. She was confounded that the impasse focused on the nation's health care system _ an indispensable service in her home country. \n \n \"We can't imagine not having a national health system,\" she said. \"I just can't believe that this country can shut down over something like a national health system. Totally bizarre, as an Australian, but fascinating.\" \n \n It turns out an institution as massive as the federal government takes some time to grind to a total halt: Many federal workers were being permitted to come in Tuesday to change voicemail messages or fill out time cards. But after that, they were under strict orders to do no work, even check their emails. \n \n With no telling how long the budget standoff will last, even programs not immediately affected could run out of cash. \n \n Barbara Haxton, executive director of the Ohio Head Start Association, said its preschool learning programs would be in jeopardy if a shutdown lasted more than two weeks. March's automatic budget cuts meant nearly 3,000 children lost access to services and there could be dire consequences if the budget standoff drags on. \n \n \"It's not as though this is a throwaway service. These are the poorest of the poor children,\" Haxton said. \"And our Congressman still gets his paycheck. His pay doesn't stop and his health insurance doesn't stop.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press reporters Kathy Matheson in Philadelphia, Joan Lowy in Washington, D.C., Dylan Lovan in Louisville, Kentucky., Terence Chea in San Francisco and Amanda Lee Myers in Cincinnati contributed to this report.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The House and Senate's failure to reach a deal to resolve the budget brouhaha has left the US without a functioning federal government for the first time in 17 years\u2014and the two sides seem so averse to compromise that it's anyone's guess when the shutdown will end. Federal agencies have been ordered to \"execute plans for an orderly shutdown,\" meaning around 800,000 federal workers will be furloughed immediately and another million or so, including Border Patrol agents and air traffic controllers, will be asked to work without pay, the New York Times reports. In the past, federal workers\u2014though not contractors\u2014have been reimbursed for time missed, but it's unclear whether Congress will approve a similar measure this time around, the Washington Post finds in its guide to the shutdown's impact on federal workers. Politico explains the process for furloughing workers: Federal employees do have to go to work today; once there, they'll be handed an official notice outlining who is essential. Those who aren't will have until mid-day to wrap things up and set up those out-of-office auto-replies. Social Security and Medicare benefits, veterans' services, and the US Postal Service will not be affected, but national parks, monuments, and other government offices are closed, and transportation safety inspectors nationwide have been furloughed, the AP finds. The Post reports that all but 549 of NASA's 18,250 employees will be furloughed ... in a slightly cruel twist, on the agency's 55th birthday. Last-minute legislation ensures that members of the military will keep receiving their paychecks. Members of Congress will also keep getting paid, but their employees will have to either work without pay or be furloughed, the Federal Times reports. Mother Jones looks at some of the more quirky casualties: the National Zoo's Panda-cam, winery permits, National Park Service golf courses, Bureau of Land Management's wild horse and burro adoption programs, and 45 fountains. John Boehner has called for a special House-Senate committee to resolve the two parties' differences, but some senior Republicans believe the shutdown could last at least a week, the Washington Post reports. Democrats, meanwhile, believe that the funding battle could overlap with debt-limit talks that need to be resolved before October 17.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The US government shut down at the stroke of midnight after Congress failed to pass a bill to fund it. The Washington Post reports that 800,000 federal workers will be furloughed, national parks will close, and most federal offices will be closed. Some will be paid during the shutdown, but others\u2014like prison guards, air traffic controllers, and Border Patrol agents\u2014may not be paid at all. Here's what agencies have said about their contingency plans: The White House budget office issued a memo telling agencies to \"execute plans for an orderly shutdown due to the absence of appropriations.\" National parks will close, and most federal offices will be closed. National monuments and museums will close, and many congressional hearings\u2014including one on last month's Navy Yard shootings\u2014will be postponed. Tens of thousands of air-traffic controllers, prison guards, and Border Patrol agents will be required to serve, but their pay may be delayed. And many congressional hearings\u2014including one scheduled for today on last month's Washington Navy Yard shootings\u2014will be postponed. John Boehner's latest proposal to fund the government for weeks, which would delay ObamaCare's individual mandate, failed in the Senate on a party-line vote. \"The responsibility for this Republican government shutdown will rest squarely on his shoulders,\" said Harry Reid.",

Among public research universities, the University of Virginia had the highest graduation rate in 2008 at 93 percent, followed by the College of William and Mary and the University of California-Berkeley. \n \n The Chronicle also found that 33 percent of universities showed a lower graduation rate in 2008 than in 2002. Some institutions suggest that the decrease in graduation rates may be a reflection of students taking longer than six years to earn a degree. \n \n Below, check out the twelve universities with the highest graduation rates in 2008, and see the Chronicle for a complete list. \n \n What do you think of these findings?

Share your thoughts in the comments section. \n \n *Some institutions included in the study, such as Golden Gate University and Alliant International University, enrolled few students -- 50 or less -- who were classified as full-time by government criteria and thus eligible for inclusion in the federal survey of graduation rates from 2002 to 2008.

Because rates can spike up or down in a particular year, we also show a separate comparison that tends to reduce the effect of those outliers on differences in colleges' rates over time.

In some cases, those students may represent a small minority of all students enrolled at the institution. A college's graduation rates can rise or fall significantly over time because of small year-to-year variations in the number of such students who enroll and complete degrees. \n \n About These Data \n \n The Chronicle analyzed changes in graduation rates reported by more than 1,000, four-year public and private nonprofit colleges and universities. We examined only institutions classified as research, master's, or Baccalaureate Colleges\u2014Arts & Sciences by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching in 2005. \n \n These rates, which colleges report annually to the U.S. Education Department, are calculated as the percentage of all first-time, full-time students entering in the fall seeking bachelor's degrees who completed bachelor's degrees within six years. At some institutions, this definition excludes a significant number of students, for example, those enrolled part time. \n \n The column labels showing a single year -- 2002 through 2008 -- refer to the final year of six-year periods. The six-year period ending in 2008 was the most recent for which comprehensive data were available from the Education Department when The Chronicle published these tables. The six-year period ending in 2002 was the first for which all colleges participating in federal-aid programs were required to report the data to the Education Department. Figures are rounded. \n \n In these tables, we compare rates for the six years ending in 2008 against rates from five years earlier, in 2003. \n \n A college's graduation rate sometimes spikes up or down in a particular year. To account for such fluctuations, The Chronicle also averaged the graduation rates for 2002 and 2003 and compared those sums with the averages of the 2007 and 2008 rates. That approach yielded results similar to those shown when only 2003 and 2008 were compared. \n \n Colleges typically describe their graduation rates using a similar but slightly different set of data, which includes students who completed any degree program, such as associate degrees. The Education Department recommends examining only students seeking bachelor's degrees when comparing four-year institutions because it facilitates consistent comparisons and because producing bachelor's recipients is a core mission of those institutions. \n \n The Chronicle's analysis recognizes that a college's graduation rate may rise if its admissions become more selective. Greater selectivity typically brings more academically prepared students, who in turn are more likely to complete degrees within six years. Conversely, graduation rates can slip when institutions become less selective. We labeled institutions that became more or less selective during the period covered by these graduation rates. The source was Barron's Profile of American Colleges, which assigns colleges among seven tiers of selectivity. We recorded whether a college changed tiers from 1996-7 to 2001-2. \n \n Other changes in student demographics could also have increased how each institution's rate changed over time, and this analysis did not further account for those effects.",

    "document": "In Henan Province, in central China, millions of people have been tuning in every week to watch an extraordinary talk show called Interviews Before Execution, in which a reporter interviews murderers condemned to death. The show ran for just over five years, until it was taken off air on Friday. \n \n Every Monday morning, reporter Ding Yu and her team scoured court reports to find cases to cover on their programme. They had to move quickly, as prisoners in China can be executed seven days after they are sentenced. \n \n To Western eyes the show's format may seem exploitative, but Ding disagrees. \n \n \"Some viewers may consider it cruel to ask a criminal to do an interview when they are about to be executed. \n \n \"On the contrary, they want to be heard,\" she says. \n \n \"Some criminals I interviewed told me: 'I'm really very glad. I said so many things in my heart to you at this time. In prison, there was never a person I was willing to talk to about past events.'\" \n \n I witness the transition from life to death Ding Yu \n \n Interviews Before Execution was first broadcast on 18 November 2006 on Henan Legal Channel, one of 3,000 state-owned TV stations in China. Ding interviewed a prisoner every week until the programme was taken off air. \n \n The move follows a handful of reports about the show in foreign media, which were triggered by a documentary to be screened on the BBC tonight and on PBS International in the near future. \n \n The aim of Interviews Before Execution, the programme-makers say, was to find cases that would serve as a warning to others. The slogan at the top of every programme called for human nature to awaken and \"perceive the value of life\". \n \n In China, 55 crimes carry the death penalty, from murder, treason and armed rebellion to bribery and smuggling. Thirteen other crimes, including VAT fraud, smuggling relics and credit fraud, were only recently removed from the list of capital offences. \n \n Interviews Before Execution, however, focused exclusively on cases of violent murder. \n \n Bullet or injection There are thought to be more executions than in any other country, although the exact number is a state secret \n \n There is no presumption of innocence in Chinese law and confessions are sometimes taken before the suspect has had access to a lawyer \n \n Convicted prisoners are killed by a single shot to the back of the head or by lethal injection inside a mobile execution truck \n \n It never interviewed political prisoners or cases where the crime was in question, and the team received the Henan high court's consent in every case. \n \n \"Without their consent, our programme would end immediately,\" Ding told the BBC documentary team. \n \n Broadcast every Saturday night, the programme was frequently rated one of Henan's top 10 shows, with nearly 40 million viewers out of the 100 million who live in the province. \n \n It made Ding Yu a star, known to many as \"Beauty with the Beasts\". \n \n If people failed to heed the warnings the programme offered, she says, then it was right that they should face the consequences. \n \n \"I feel sorry and regretful for them. But I don't sympathise with them, for they should pay a heavy price for their wrongdoing. They deserve it.\" \n \n Many of the cases featured in the programme were motivated by money and one case in particular stands out for Ding. \n \n The perpetrators were boyfriend and girlfriend - young, educated college graduates. \n \n Image caption Bao Ronting was the first openly gay man Ding Yu ever met \n \n The couple planned to rob her grandparents but it went wrong and the young man, 27-year-old Zhang Peng, ended up killing them both. \n \n \"They are so young. They never had the chance to see this world, or to enjoy life, a career, work, and the love of family. \n \n \"They've made the wrong choice, and the price is their lives,\" Ding says. \n \n But after more than 200 interviews, little surprises her. \n \n \"I've interviewed criminals even younger than that young student, some just 18 years old. That is the minimum age you can be sentenced to death.\" \n \n Homosexuality is still a huge taboo in China, and when in 2008 the show covered the case of Bao Ronting, a gay man who murdered his mother, ratings soared. \n \n It was the first time Ding had ever met an openly gay man. \n \n \"I had never come close to a gay man, so I really couldn't accept some of his practices, words and deeds. \n \n \"Though he was a man, he asked me in a very feminine tone, 'Do you feel awkward speaking to me?' Actually I felt very awkward,\" she recalls. \n \n Find out more Interviews Before Execution is part of the latest This World series, broadcast on Monday 12 March at 23:20 GMT on BBC Two. \n \n Watch againon iPlayer (UK only) using the link. \n \n She and her team made a further three episodes on the case of Bao Ronting and followed him until the day he was executed in November 2008. \n \n During one of these meetings, Bao asked Ding: \"Will I go to heaven?\" \n \n Remembering these words, she reflects: \"I witness the transition from life to death.\" \n \n Bao Ronting was paraded in an open top truck on the way to his execution with a placard around his neck, detailing his crime. The practice is illegal in modern China - but the law is not always observed. \n \n Judge Lui Wenling, who worked closely with the programme-makers, says things are changing in the Chinese legal system. \n \n \"The present criminal policies in China are 'To kill less and cautiously' and 'Combining lenience and strictness'. \n \n \"It means, 'If the case is fit for lenient treatment, give it lenience,' and, 'If the case should be strictly treated, give it a strict punishment,'\" he says. \n \n Ding recently covered the case of Wu Yanyan, a young mother who murdered her husband after allegedly suffering years of abuse. \n \n Since the death sentence for criminals is itself a violent act, then we should abolish it Judge Pan \n \n She was initially sentenced to death for the murder. But since 2007, every execution verdict in China has to be approved by the Supreme Court, and in this case it took the view that the abuse provided mitigating circumstances. \n \n The higher court kept returning the case to the local court until the death sentence was suspended. \n \n Ding visited the prison with Wu Yanyan's daughter for an emotional reunion. If the young mother continues to behave well in prison, after two years she could ultimately be released - a small sign of changing attitudes in China. \n \n Some senior figures in the justice system foresee more far-reaching reforms in the future, including Judge Pan, another judge who has worked closely with the programme. \n \n \"A life could end in the twinkling of an eye after a trial. I'd say this is also very cruel,\" she says. \n \n \"It's also a means of getting rid of evil deeds through an evil deed. \n \n \"Should we abolish the death penalty? Since the death sentence for criminals is itself a violent act, then we should abolish it. However, I don't think our country is ready yet. \n \n \"But in the future, it would be good to abolish it.\" ||||| ABC \n \n The 40-million fans who have been faithfully tuning into China's death row reality show, \"Interviews Before Execution\" may have watched the last episode without knowing it. \n \n Legal TV Channel, the station in central China's Henan province that produced and broadcast the show for the last five years, confirmed to ABC News it has been abruptly canceled due to \"internal problems\" and will not be seen again. \n \n A spokesman at the station said that a new program on legal affairs will be broadcast in its place but could provide no further details. Requests for an interview with the host of \"Interviews Before Execution\" Ding Yu, were denied. \n \n The cancellation comes at the end of a week in which the show made international headlines for the first time. \n \n Both the BBC and PBS International own the rights to a documentary film, \"Dead Men Talking,\" produced by a film company in China which goes behind the scenes for an up close look at how the show is made. \n \n BBC2 has plans to air the show next week. \n \n Articles in the Daily Mail, New York Times, ABC News and numerous other outlets described the show as a one of a kind reality series on a dark topic: death row inmates just before they die. \n \n The host, journalist Ding Yu, interviewed more than 200 Chinese men and women, sometimes just hours before they were put to death. The majority of convictions were for murder under often gruesome circumstances. \n \n In clips found online (many of which were taken down this week) Ding interviews a child-killer and a man who stabbed his ex-wife in front of her parents. Another killed a mother and child with an ax. \n \n At times she promises to convey final messages to family members. At other times she is harsh, telling one subject that he deserves to die. \n \n According to the Daily Mail, the show was approved by the government as a deterrent to would-be criminals. \n \n Convicts were chosen by a judiciary committee for Ding for being \"suitable subjects to educate the public.\" \n \n Ding herself is a subject in the documentary and for the first time she speaks about the toll her work takes on her and describes the haunting images she lives with as a result of spending so much time with the men and women she interviews. \n \n The show was not broadcast nationwide. \n \n Few people know of it outside of Henan province in central China. \n \n In China, 55 crimes are punishable by death. \n \n China is the only country that does not release the number of people executed each year, despite international calls to do so by groups such as Amnesty International. \n \n It is estimated that about a thousand people are put to death each year. That number cannot be confirmed but puts China well ahead of any other country by far. \n \n Fan Bing contributed to this report.",

    "document": "Credit: NASA \n \n SYDNEY: Water originating from solar winds has been found in the Moon\u2019s soil, U.S. researchers have announced. \n \n Water on the Moon is not a new discovery \u2013 there are known sources in craters at the polar regions \u2013 but this finding has revealed a new source: the solar winds. \n \n In a report published in Nature Geoscience, researchers claimed that hydrogen ejected from the Sun\u2019s atmosphere is carried in solar winds and implanted in the lunar soil, where it reacts with oxygen already present on the Moon\u2019s surface. \n \n Colonising the Moon \n \n The finding could be a useful resource for future human settlement on the Moon, according to Yang Liu from the University of Tennessee, lead author of the paper. \n \n \u201cNow we have ready sources of water that can not only be consumed by plants and humans, but also electrolysed into its constituent elements \u2013 hydrogen and oxygen \u2013 to make rocket fuel,\u201d she said. \n \n However, geochemist Ross Taylor from the Australian Academy of Science, who was not involved in the research, said harvesting water from lunar soil would be complicated and using it for human settlement probably unrealistic. \n \n \u201cI think it\u2019s a pretty long shot, extracting the water might be as much trouble as it\u2019s worth,\u201d he said. \n \n Water origin unknown until now \n \n With no atmosphere to protect it, the lunar surface is buffeted by solar winds and comet collisions, which create a soil of crushed materials called the \u2018regolith\u2019. \n \n Researchers analysed a collection of cemented regolith grains \u2013 a glass-like material \u2013 to find reacting hydrogen and oxygen molecules which they attributed to solar winds. \n \n Three independent studies observed water on the surface of the Moon in 2009, but the origin was unknown until now, said Liu. \n \n \u201cWe did have the understanding that the Moon is a very dry place, what this work has done is look at a new source of lunar water,\u201d added planetary scientist Michele Bannister from Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, who was not involved in the study. \n \n \u201cThe researchers have proved you can generate water on the surface of the Moon purely from the impact of the wind of the Sun,\u201d she said. \n \n Beyond the snow line \n \n Initially, it was believed all water in the inner Solar System was delivered via icy bodies such as micrometeorites or comets that came from further out in space \u2013 beyond the \u2018snow line\u2019 where it is cold enough for water to condense. \n \n Having established another source of water that originates at the centre of the Solar System, the report said it \u201creshapes this perspective\u201d. \n \n It is also not known what percentage of the lunar soil contains water, and Bannister said a bigger sample is needed. \n \n \u201cWhat they\u2019re working with is a tiny fraction of lunar soil brought back by the Apollo missions, so it\u2019s very hard to generalise from a couple of grains of sand \u2013 or glass, which is essentially what they have,\u201d she said. \n \n Water in the Universe \n \n Liu said a source of water in the solar winds \u201cemphasises the possibility of finding water on the surface of other similar airless bodies\u201d. \n \n \u201cIt extends our concept of the presence of water in the inner Solar System,\u201d she said. \n \n Although the study has introduced a new source of water relevant to the wider universe, Taylor explained it is really just chemistry. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting scientific finding and it takes a lot of modern technology and instrumentation to reach that, but it doesn\u2019t alter the overall picture,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cThe reason everyone\u2019s interested in water is partly because water has a sort of \u2018sacred cow\u2019 status. It\u2019s essential to life as we know it and this gives it importance, but it\u2019s just another chemical compound.\u201d ||||| SPACE.com reader George Garcia sent in his photo of the September 2012 harvest moon taken on Sept. 29, 2012, in Montebello, CA. \n \n Glass beads within moon rocks suggest that water seen on the lunar surface originates from the solar wind, researchers say. \n \n These findings suggest that other airless bodies in the solar system may also possess water on their surfaces, investigators added. \n \n Arguments raged for years as to whether the moon harbored frozen water or not. Recent findings confirmed that water does wet the moon, although its surface remains drier than any desert on Earth. \n \n \"With the cost of $25,000 for taking one pint of water to the moon, it is essential that we develop processes of producing water from the materials on the moon,\" said the study's lead author, Yang Liu, at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. \"This is paramount to human settlement of the moon in the near future.\" [Gallery: Our Changing Moon] \n \n \"This water would be of most value as rocket fuel \u2014 liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen,\" Liu added. \"Until the recent discovery of water in and on the moon, this was going to be a very energy-intensive endeavor to separate these elements from the lunar rocks and soil. Now we have ready sources of water that can be consumed by plants and humans, but also broken up into its constituent elements \u2014 oxygen and hydrogen. Thus, we could use the moon as a jump-board for missions to Mars and beyond.\" \n \n It remained uncertain where all of this water might come from, although some apparently came from ice-rich comets. To find out more, scientists analyzed lunar surface dust, or regolith, that astronauts on the Apollo missions brought from the moon. \n \n \"Most samples actually come from an Apollo 11 soil collected by Neil Armstrong,\" Liu told SPACE.com. \n \n Lunar regolith is created by meteoroids and charged particles constantly bombarding lunar rock. The researchers focused on grains of glass in the samples that were created in the heat of countless micrometeoroid impacts on the moon. They reasoned this glass might have captured any water in the regolith before it cooled and solidified. \n \n The investigators found that a large percentage of this glass contained traces of wetness \u2014 between 200 and 300 parts per million of water and the molecule hydroxyl, which is much like water, save that each of its molecules possesses just one hydrogen atom, not two. \n \n To figure out where this water and hydroxyl originated from, the scientists looked at their hydrogen components. Hydrogen atoms come in a variety of isotopes, each with a different number of neutrons in their nuclei \u2014 regular hydrogen has no neutrons, while the isotope known as deuterium has one in each atomic nucleus. \n \n The sun is naturally low in deuterium because its nuclear activity rapidly consumes the isotope. All other objects in the solar system possess relatively high levels of it, remnants of deuterium that existed in the nebula of gas and dust that gave birth to the solar system. \n \n The researchers found that the water and hydroxyl seen in the lunar glass were both low in deuterium. This suggests their hydrogen came from the sun, probably blasted onto the moon via winds of charged particles from the sun, which continuously streams from the sun at a rate of 2.2 billion pounds (1 billion kilograms) per second. The moon, lacking a significant atmosphere or magnetic field, slowly captures all the particles striking it. The hydrogen particles then bonded with oxygen bound in rocks on the lunar surface. \n \n \"The origin of surface water on the moon was unclear,\" Liu said. \"We provide robust evidence for a solar wind origin. This finding emphasizes the potential in finding such water on the surface of other similar airless bodies, such as Eros, Deimos, Vesta.\" \n \n The scientists detailed their findings online Sunday (Oct. 14) in the journal Nature Geoscience. \n \n Follow SPACE.com on Twitter @Spacedotcom.

That's the conclusion of a new study, after studying soil samples brought back from the original Apollo 11 mission, Cosmos reports. While studies dating back to 2008 have pointed to the existence of water on the moon, until now no one was sure where it came from. Now, University of Tennessee researchers believe that solar winds carry hydrogen ejected from the sun's atmosphere to the moon.

    "document": "Editor's Note: On Friday, Feb. 6. 2015, ISIS said the hostage was killed by a Jordanian airstrike. \n \n With ISIS\u2019s brutal murder of Peter Kassig, a 26-year-old American aid worker who dedicated his life to the plight of Syrian refugees, the militant group has one more U.S. citizen remaining in its clutches, according to current and former U.S. officials, as well as individuals involved in efforts to free the Americans. \n \n The hostage is the only American woman held by the militant group. She is the same age as Kassig, and, like him, was kidnapped while trying to help people whose lives have been upended by the long Syrian civil war. She was particularly moved to help children who have been orphaned and separated from their families. The woman was taken in August 2013, along with a group of other aid workers who have reportedly been released. \n \n U.S. officials and the woman\u2019s family have requested that her name not be made public, fearing that further attention will put her in greater jeopardy. No news organization has published her name. But the general circumstances of her capture and captivity have been known and widely reported for more than a year now. \n \n ISIS\u2019s intentions for its remaining American prisoner are unclear. But current and former U.S. officials told The Daily Beast that it was notable she doesn\u2019t appear at the end of a video, released Sunday, that shows the aftermath of Kassig\u2019s beheading. That breaks with ISIS\u2019s pattern of showing the next hostage it intends to kill. \n \n ISIS has killed Muslim women, as well as children. But it has never murdered a female Western hostage on camera. Doing so would mark a radical departure even for a group that has relied on bloody propaganda to lure foreign fighters to its ranks. \n \n A former U.S. counterterrorism official said that before ISIS decides what to do with its remaining American hostage, it will consider carefully the public reaction it could spark. \u201cBefore they\u2019re doing anything, they want to have a really good feel for how it will play,\u201d the former official said. \n \n ISIS has reportedly demanded more than $6 million for the remaining American hostage\u2019s freedom, a figure in keeping with the impossibly high ransoms it has placed on other U.S. citizens it has held. The Obama administration has a firm policy of not paying ransom for hostages and has even advised the families of Americans held in Syria that they could be criminally prosecuted if they paid for their loved ones\u2019 releases. (ISIS has freed European citizens, however, from countries where ransoms aren\u2019t illegal.) \n \n The fact that ISIS requests any ransom for its American prisoners and makes it too high for most people to pay indicates that the group isn\u2019t really serious about freeing the Americans, according to current and former U.S. officials and hostage-negotiation experts. Instead, the hostages are being used as props in ISIS\u2019s global propaganda campaign, which is largely aimed at recruiting new followers. Viewed through that lens, ISIS\u2019s American and British captives (the U.K. likewise has an official ban on ransoms) have been more useful to the group for its videos than in raising money, even though ransoms are an important source of ISIS\u2019s income. \n \n The latest ISIS video, showing Kassig\u2019s death, had been expected ever since he was first shown on camera in early October, in another beheading video, and identified as the militant group\u2019s next victim. But this new film differs in key respects from its predecessors, and it may offer new insights into ISIS\u2019s propaganda strategy\u2014and its weaknesses. \n \n The latest video is uncharacteristically long, clocking in at more than 16 minutes, as opposed to the earlier two- to three-minute films showing hostages being murdered. The new video is filled with breathless celebration of the rise of the so-called Islamic State and an exhortation to its followers to join in armed struggle against the \u201ccrusader\u201d forces of the United States and the United Kingdom. Indeed, it seems rather desperate in its chest-thumping. It\u2019s also remarkably more brutal\u2014though not to American hostages. A parade of knife-wielding ISIS fighters behead 18 captives, described as Syrian military officers and pilots, in a ghoulish display filled with slow-motion effects and ominous music. It\u2019s by far the most grisly depiction of beheadings ever shown by ISIS. \n \n Kassig is shown only near the end of the video, already beheaded. Unlike other hostages who have read (presumably coerced) statements denouncing the U.S.-led airstrikes, Kassig is never shown speaking. His killer alludes to the fact that he had \u201clittle to say\u201d and that other American captives killed before him had already spoken out against the Obama administration. Several current and former U.S. officials speculated that Kassig, who converted to Islam while in captivity and adopted the name Abdul Rahman, might have defied his captors by refusing to read their script or even have insisted on reciting passages from the Quran. \u201cI suspect that Pete knew this was coming and that he refused to talk,\u201d said one individual who has been involved with efforts to free American hostages. \n \n Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

The Kassigs, of Indiana, had given television interviews about their son, made YouTube videos pleading with ISIS for his release, and held prayer vigils with members of the American Muslim community. At every turn, they described their son as a faithful follower who had dedicated his life to easing the suffering of innocents. \n \n In a statement Sunday, Kassig\u2019s parents said their son was \u201cfed by a strong desire to use his life to save the lives of others\u201d and that he \u201cwas drawn to the camps that are filled with displaced families and to understaffed hospitals inside Syria. We know he found his home amongst the Syrian people, and he hurt when they were hurting.\u201d \n \n President Obama, also in a statement, called Kassig by his chosen Muslim name and contrasted his charity and self-sacrifice with the \u201cdarkness\u201d of ISIS. Secretary of State John Kerry called Kassig \u201ca young American who personified the values of altruism and compassion which are the very essence of his adopted religion of Islam.\u201d \n \n ISIS\u2019s long-winded video recites chapter and verse the historic roots of the group, from its early days in Iraq fighting U.S. forces in 2004, and seeks to position the rise of ISIS as an inevitable development in a grand battle against the \u201ccrusaders.\u201d The video also argues that ISIS is collecting followers across the Middle East, even as far east as China. \n \n ISIS has a reason to buck up its forces and make itself seem invincible: U.S. airstrikes against the group are starting to yield some results. On Saturday, Iraqi ground forces, supported by American aircraft, took back an important oil refinery in Baiji, about 130 miles north of Baghdad, that ISIS had seized. (Illicit oil revenue has been a major source of the group\u2019s funding.) And the U.S. has been closing in on ISIS\u2019s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, though efforts to kill him and his followers have been frustrated by ISIS\u2019s use of encryption to shield its communications from American surveillance efforts. \n \n Still, the video is a reminder of how feckless U.S. efforts to free American hostages have become. Insiders have said the process has been marred by bureaucratic turf wars and a refusal by the United States to negotiate with ISIS, which has freed European hostages in exchange for ransom. \n \n The State Department and the White House have been opposed to paying ransoms, but the FBI and the Justice Department have taken a more nuanced position, according to people involved in the efforts. In particular, the FBI told the parents of James Foley, the first American whom ISIS killed on camera, that they could \u201cwalk us right up to that point\u201d of paying a ransom but not be directly involved in exchanging funds, Diane Foley, James\u2019s mother, told The Daily Beast last month. \n \n The FBI has facilitated the payment of a ransom for American hostages before, most notably in 2002, for the release of two Christian missionaries, Martin and Gracia Burnham, who were held by an al Qaeda affiliate in the Philippines. A former U.S. official said the FBI took steps to obscure its role and that the terrorists never knew the U.S. government was involved in the ransom effort. \n \n More recently, a ransom allegedly was paid to free American journalist Peter Theo Curtis in August from al-Nusra Front, al Qaeda\u2019s branch in Syria, according to two sources with direct knowledge of Curtis\u2019s case. Suspicion has focused on the government of Qatar, which has strong ties to Nusra, as the source of the money. \n \n A spokesperson for the State Department has denied that the United States paid a ransom, and administration officials told the Qataris they shouldn\u2019t pay one, either. FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said that the bureau fully complies with U.S. policy as it relates to ransom payments. According to individuals familiar with the matter, Nusra may have hoped that by negotiating for Curtis\u2019s release, it would demonstrate to the United States that it wasn\u2019t as extreme as ISIS and could engage in a reasonable dialogue. \n \n Those hopes might be dashed, however, by U.S. airstrikes in Syria, which have hit Nusra positions, provoking the group\u2019s wrath. Prior to the bombing campaign, which began in September, U.S. intelligence officials warned not to hit the Nusra group, which occasionally has fought alongside U.S.-backed rebels in Syria. Now Nusra is forging an alliance with ISIS, an outcome that had once been considered unthinkable because of a deep schism between ISIS and al Qaeda over the future of the Islamist movement. \n \n How that might effect the Westerners still held in Syria is unknown. The-26 year-old aid worker being held by ISIS isn\u2019t the only one. Freelance journalist Austin Tice was abducted in Syria more than two years ago. The Obama administration has claimed that Tice was held by the Syrian government. But this claim has never been verified and who holds him now is unclear. ||||| BEIRUT (AP) \u2014 The Islamic State group has beheaded Peter Kassig, releasing a video Sunday showing a masked militant standing over the severed head of a man it said was the former U.S. Army Ranger-turned-aid worker, who was seized while delivering relief supplies in Syria last year. \n \n This still image taken from an undated video published on the Internet by the Islamic State group militants and made available, Sunday, Nov. 16, 2014, purports to show extremists marching Syrian soldiers...

A new graphic video purportedly produced by Islamic... (Associated Press) \n \n President Barack Obama confirmed Kassig's slaying after a U.S. review of the video, which also showed the mass beheadings of a dozen Syrian soldiers. \n \n The 26-year-old Kassig, who founded an aid group to help Syrians caught in their country's brutal civil war, \"was taken from us in an act of pure evil by a terrorist group that the world rightly associates with inhumanity,\" Obama said in a statement. \n \n He denounced the extremist group, which he said \"revels in the slaughter of innocents, including Muslims, and is bent only on sowing death and destruction.\" \n \n The slain hostage's parents, Ed and Paula Kassig, said they were \"heartbroken\" by their son's killing, but \"incredibly proud\" of his humanitarian work. \n \n Kassig \"lost his life as a result of his love for the Syrian people and his desire to ease their suffering,\" the parents said in a statement from Indianapolis, where a vigil was held Sunday for the slain American. His parents attended the vigil. \n \n With Kassig's death, the Islamic State group has killed five Westerners it was holding. American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were beheaded, as were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning. \n \n Unlike previous videos of slain Western hostages, the footage released Sunday did not show the decapitation of Kassig or the moments leading up to his death. \n \n \"This is Peter Edward Kassig, a U.S. citizen ... who fought against the Muslims in Iraq,\" said the black-clad militant, who spoke with a British accent that was distorted in the video, apparently to disguise his identity. Previous videos featured a militant with a British accent that the FBI says it has identified, though it hasn't named him publicly. \n \n The footage released Sunday identifies the militants' location as Dabiq, a town in northern Syria that the Islamic State group uses as the title of its English-language propaganda magazine and where they believe an apocalyptic battle between Muslims and their enemies will occur. \n \n The high-definition video also showed the beheadings of about a dozen men identified as Syrian military officers and pilots, all dressed in blue jumpsuits. The black-clad militant warns that U.S. soldiers will meet a similar fate. \n \n \"We say to you, Obama: You claim to have withdrawn from Iraq four years ago,\" the militant said. \"Here you are: You have not withdrawn. Rather, you hid some of your forces behind your proxies.\" A U.S.-led coalition is targeting the Islamic State group in airstrikes, supporting Western-backed Syrian rebels, Kurdish fighters and the Iraqi military. \n \n Kassig, who served in the U.S. Army's 75th Ranger Regiment, a special operations unit, deployed to Iraq in 2007. After being medically discharged, he returned to the Middle East in 2012 and formed a relief group, Special Emergency Response and Assistance, to aid Syrian refugees. \n \n A certified EMT, Kassig had delivered food and medical supplies and provided trauma care to wounded Syrians before being captured in eastern Syria on Oct. 1, 2013. Friends say he converted to Islam in captivity and took the first name Abdul-Rahman. \n \n In a statement issued as he flew back to Washington from the Asia-Pacific region, Obama said Kassig \"was a humanitarian who worked to save the lives of Syrians injured and dispossessed\" by war. The president offered prayers and condolences to Kassig's family. \n \n \"We cannot begin to imagine their anguish at this painful time,\" he said. \n \n Burhan Agha, a Syrian who worked with Kassig in Lebanon, wept when recounting his friend's humanitarian work. \n \n \"If I could apologize to each American, one by one, I would, because Peter died in Syria, while he was helping the Syrian people,\" Agha told The Associated Press by telephone from Switzerland, where he is seeking asylum. \"Those who killed him claimed to have done it in the name of Islam. I am a Muslim and am from Syria. ... (His killers) are not Muslims.\" \n \n British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was \"horrified by the cold-blooded murder,\" saying that the Islamic State group had \"again shown their depravity.\" \n \n In previous videos showing the beheadings of the two American journalists and two British aid workers, the hostages were shown kneeling in orange jumpsuits as they were forced to make speeches before their killer lifted a knife to their throats. \n \n The latest video did not show Kassig being beheaded. And unlike previous videos, it did not show other Western captives or directly threaten to behead anyone else. It also had lingering close-ups on some militants' exposed faces, a few of whom appeared to be foreigners. \n \n The video appeared on websites used in the past by the Islamic State group, which now controls a third of Syria and Iraq. \n \n The terror group still holds other captives, including British photojournalist John Cantlie, who has appeared in several videos delivering statements for the IS, likely under duress, and a 26-year-old American woman captured last year in Syria while working for aid groups. U.S. officials have asked that the woman not be identified out of fears for her safety. \n \n The video appeared to be part of continuous efforts to strike at the U.S., which is leading an aerial campaign against the group that began in August in Iraq and spread to Syria the following month. \n \n The video came two days after a recording by the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, was uploaded to the Internet. The militant leader warned that the U.S.-led coalition's campaign had failed and it would eventually have to send ground troops into battle. \n \n The group has declared a self-styled Islamic caliphate in areas under its control, which it governs according to its violent interpretation of Shariah law, including massacring rebellious tribes and selling women and children of religious minorities into slavery. \n \n The group's militants have also beheaded and shot dead hundreds of captives, mostly Syrian and Iraqi soldiers, during its sweep across the two countries, and has celebrated its mass killings in extremely graphic videos. \n \n The Islamic State group has its roots in al-Qaida's Iraqi affiliate but was expelled from the global terror network over its brutal tactics and refusal to obey orders to confine its activities to Iraq. It became even more extreme amid the bloody civil war in neighboring Syria and grew strong enough to launch a lightning offensive across Iraq. \n \n Syria's war began as an uprising against President Bashar Assad. Activists say that conflict has killed more than 200,000 people. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Julie Pace in Brisbane, Australia, David Aguilar in Detroit, Jon Gambrell in Cairo, Vivian Salama in Baghdad and Josh Lederman aboard Air Force One contributed to this report. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"The 26-year-old American was captured last year\" \n \n A video posted online claims to show that Islamic State militants have killed the captured US aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig. \n \n The video shows a masked man standing over a severed head which he says is that of Mr Kassig. \n \n The US says it is working to determine the authenticity of the video, which also shows a mass beheading of 18 Syrian troops. \n \n Mr Kassig, also known as Peter, was captured last year. \n \n His family, who live in the US state of Indiana, said they were awaiting confirmation of the reports about their \"treasured son\". \n \n \"We prefer our son is written about and remembered for his important work and the love he shared with friends and family, not in the manner the hostage takers would use to manipulate Americans and further their cause,\" the family said in a statement. \n \n Analysis: Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner: \"This is an act of desperation\" \n \n This is perhaps the most elaborate and graphic of all the murder videos posted online by IS. Much of it is taken up with a recent history lesson on Iraq and Syria as seen through the eyes of the jihadists. But the latter part shows the beheading of 18 Syrian prisoners in revolting, lingering detail. \n \n Unlike earlier videos, this one revels in gore. Amongst the boiler-suited captives murdered in cold blood is a man IS says is the former US soldier Peter Kassig, who converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul-Rahman. \n \n Neither his conversion, nor the fact that he was helping refugees when he was captured a year ago, appear to have saved him. \n \n Mr Kassig's murder is a sign of frustration that IS militants are unable to hit back at the coalition air strikes that have driven them off key sites like the Mosul and Haditha dams, and prevented them from seizing the town of Kobane. \n \n An idealist 'simply trying to help people' \n \n Abdul-Rahman Kassig in his own words \n \n Unlike similar videos released in the past, the latest shows the faces of many of the jihadis. It also at one point gives a specific location - near Dabiq in Aleppo province, with an identifiable village in the background. \n \n The latest video did not show the person identified as Mr Kassig being beheaded. Also unlike previous videos, it did not show other Western captives or directly threaten to behead anyone else. \n \n The US National Security Council said it was investigating the video, and would be \"appalled by the brutal murder\" if it was confirmed. \n \n IS has previously murdered four Western hostages - British men Alan Henning and David Haines, and US journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. \n \n Those killings were carried out by a man believed to be British. That man bears a resemblance to one of the masked militants pictured in the video purporting to show Mr Kassig. \n \n Image copyright EPA Image caption Parents Ed and Paula Kassig have said they are awaiting confirmation of the reports \n \n British Prime Minister David Cameron said he was \"horrified by the cold-blooded murder\" and that Islamic State had \"again shown their depravity\". \n \n Emotional letter \n \n Image copyright Handout Image caption A photograph of Abdul-Rahman with his father, Ed, fishing on the Ohio River in Indiana in 2011 \n \n Mr Kassig's parents last month released extracts of a letter written by their son, in which he said the \"stress and fear\" of captivity were \"incredible\". \n \n \"They tell us you have abandoned us and/or don't care but of course we know you are doing everything you can and more. \n \n \"Don't worry Dad, if I do go down, I won't go thinking anything but what I know to be true. That you and mom love me more than the moon and the stars.\" \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Former hostage Nicholas Henin spoke to the BBC about Mr Kassig in October \n \n Mr Kassig was a former US Army Ranger who served in Iraq. \n \n He later trained as an emergency medical technician and founded the Special Emergency Response and Assistance (Sera) organisation, helping to supply camps on both sides of the Syrian border. \n \n He was undertaking a project for Sera when he was captured in October 2013 while travelling to eastern Syria. \n \n The exiled leader of Syria's opposition National Coalition, Hadi al-Bahra, said in a statement Mr Kassig would be remembered as a hero. \n \n \"Kassig paid the ultimate sacrifice trying to relieve the suffering of his fellow human beings far away from home. The thugs of Isis will pay the price for their evil crimes,\" he said.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 ISIS has beheaded another hostage, but while the outcome is grimly familiar, analysts say the video revealing the death of Peter Kassig has differences that hint at serious problems for the militant group. Unlike four earlier videos showing the execution of Western hostages, the quality is poor, Kassig is not seen reading a statement, and no other hostage is displayed. Instead, only the American's severed head is shown. Analysts suspect that the threat of airstrikes stopped the militants from being able to film outside for long. \"The likeliest possibility is that something went wrong when they were beheading him,\" an expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies tells the New York Times. Another possibility, he says, is that Kassig resisted and the \"media-savvy\" militants were unable to get the video they wanted. Other analysts speculate that the hostage\u2014who converted to Islam while in captivity\u2014may have chosen to recite quotes from the Koran instead of his captors' script. More: Kassig, a former US Army Ranger, founded an organization to aid refugees from the Syrian civil war. His parents say they are heartbroken by the killing but incredibly proud of his work, the AP reports. He \"lost his life as a result of his love for the Syrian people and his desire to ease their suffering,\" his parents, who live in Indianapolis, said in a statement. The latest ISIS video, which also shows the execution of 18 Syrian captives in \"revolting, lingering detail,\" is also different because it shows the faces of many militants and gives a specific location in Syria, notes BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner. He calls Kassig's execution an \"act of desperation\" carried out by the group because it is unable to fight back against coalition airstrikes. With Kassig dead, ISIS' only remaining American hostage is a 26-year-old woman, security officials tell the Daily Beast. Like Kassig, she was kidnapped while carrying out aid work. Her name has not been made public and officials say it is significant that she doesn't appear in the group's latest video\u2014and while it's not clear what the militants have planned for her, even ISIS is likely to carefully consider the public reaction to killing a female Western captive on camera.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 With the beheading of Peter Kassig, ISIS now has one more American hostage in its clutches, reports the Daily Beast, citing current and former US officials. She is the same age as Kassig and, like him, was kidnapped while trying to help people whose lives have been upended by the Syrian civil war. The woman was taken in August 2013, along with a group of other aid workers who have reportedly been released. US officials and the woman's family have requested that her name not be made public, fearing that further attention will put her in greater jeopardy. No news organization has published her name. But the general circumstances of her capture and captivity have been known and widely reported for more than a year now. ISIS's intentions for her remaining American hostage are unclear. But current and former US officials tell the Daily Beast that it was notable she doesn't appear at the end of a video, released yesterday, that shows the aftermath of Kassig's beheading. That breaks with ISIS' pattern of showing the next hostage it intends to kill. ISIS has killed Muslim women, as well as children. But it has never murdered a female Western hostage on camera. Doing so would mark a radical departure even for a group that has relied on bloody propaganda to lure foreign fighters to its ranks. The new video is filled with breathless celebration of the rise of the so-called Islamic State and an exhortation to its followers to join in armed struggle against the \"crusader\" forces of the United States and the UK. It's \"by far the most important thing to the United States,\" says a former State Department official.",

    "document": "SOCHI, RUSSIA -- Three points from Portugal and Spain's remarkable 3-3 draw at Fisht Stadium in which Cristiano Ronaldo scored a sublime hat-trick. \n \n 1. Ronaldo's three goals earn Portugal a point \n \n For a guy whose deeds are so often defined by numbers, whether it's the fact that he has more goals than games for Real Madrid or the fact that nobody has more Ballon d'Or awards stashed away in his trophy cabinet, there was one that seemed out of sync before this World Cup began: three, as in the number of goals that Cristiano Ronaldo had scored in the World Cup to date. \n \n Yet he remedied that perceived dearth against Spain Friday, nabbing a hat-trick in a 3-3 draw to open their World Cup campaign. The first was a penalty he won himself, his nifty stopover prompting Nacho to dangle a leg over which Ronaldo gleefully fell. The second was a gift from David De Gea, who pushed his edge-of-the-box snap shot over the goal line, though again, there's something to be said for Ronaldo's alertness on the break that he was there to capitalize on Goncalo Guedes' layoff following Pepe's defensive clearance. The third was a magisterial free kick that disappeared into the top corner, leaving De Gea flat-footed. \n \n Ronaldo joins Miroslav Klose, Uwe Seeler and Pele as the only players who have scored in four World Cups. He also becomes the oldest player to score a hat-trick in World Cup history, at 33 years and 131 days. And he equals the legendary Ferenc Puskas, the most prolific European-born international goalscorer in history and the second most-prolific overall. (Iran's Ali Daei, at 109, may not be entirely out of his reach either.) \n \n He has broad shoulders, this one, which is a good thing, as a nation is riding on his back. \n \n Cristiano Ronaldo has a whole host of records for Real Madrid and Portugal. ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images) \n \n 2. Diego Costa's heroics stand out for Spain \n \n He has, at times, looked like a foreign object in a Spain shirt. Even as Julen Lopetegui's side romped through qualification to the World Cup, Diego Costa managed just nine appearances, lasting 90 minutes on just three occasions. But against Portugal he showed just how much value there is in him being so different. \n \n The first goal was vintage Costa: the angry forearm clear-out on Pepe, the deceptively quick legs to send Jose Fonte the wrong way, the threaded smash between two opponents. The second carried his hallmark too, as he used his physicality and hunger to get to the ball first and nudge it past Rui Patricio. The rest was selflessness, sacrifice and running battles with Pepe and Fonte, but always on the right side of VAR. \n \n Just what Spain needed. \n \n 3. A fair result for both teams \n \n The table shows Iran leading the group following their late 1-0 win against Morocco. But beyond the drama of a see-saw game -- one of the best group openers we've seen in a long time -- and the fact that they are two points off the top, there are positive takeaways for both teams. \n \n Spain ultimately controlled much of the game and can chalk up two of the goals conceded to uncharacteristic individual errors. There's some tweaking to be done but the post-Lopetegui meltdown simply didn't materialize. \n \n As for Portugal, it was always going to be a dog-fight of a group. But a point against Spain is a massive boost ahead of their next game, coming against a Morocco side already with their backs to the wall. ||||| Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup 2018: Portugal 3-3 Spain - watch all six goals in under a minute \n \n \"The night was about Cristiano. He is relentless in his pursuit of greatness. What he is doing on the world stage is ridiculous.\" \n \n Match of the Day pundit Rio Ferdinand said he \"couldn't breathe\" as former Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo scored a hat-trick, including an 88th-minute equaliser, as Portugal drew 3-3 with Spain in a classic World Cup encounter. \n \n Ronaldo, as he so often does, had the last word in a match full of drama, as Spain came within minutes of securing a happy ending to a turbulent week in which they sacked their manager a day before the start of the tournament. \n \n So just how good was this Ronaldo display? Well, his was the star turn in a match that is sure to be remembered for years to come. \n \n \"I'm going to get a flight back tomorrow because I won't see a better game,\" joked former England winger Chris Waddle. \n \n What did Ronaldo do? \n \n It took just over three minutes for Portugal's captain to make his mark on the game in Sochi, drawing Nacho into a foul in the area and converting the penalty with trademark cool. \n \n Diego Costa equalised brilliantly but Ronaldo struck a second time, David de Gea's uncharacteristic fumble into the net a gift to the Real Madrid man. \n \n Costa scored again to make it 2-2 before Nacho made amends with a sublime strike to put Spain 3-2 up. \n \n But then came that free-kick... \n \n A one-in-45 shot \n \n Media playback is not supported on this device Ronaldo scores 'sensational' free-kick to complete hat-trick \n \n Standing over the ball as De Gea set his wall and with just two minutes remaining, there was no doubt it would be Ronaldo who would take the set piece. And yet history suggested a team-mate - any team-mate - might have been better placed.. \n \n This, remarkably, was Ronaldo's first goal from a direct free-kick in 45 attempts at major championships. \n \n \"One or two will ask why I said at half-time Ronaldo needs to work on free-kicks. Well it's because it took him 45 attempts, but he did it,\" said former England captain Alan Shearer. \n \n \"It's a brilliant free-kick and it is technically so difficult to do,\" added former England midfielder Danny Murphy. \"He went over and around the wall and it had all sorts of bend and dip on it.\" \n \n Speaking on Russia Today, Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho offered a reminder that Ronaldo's free-kick record has worsened since his days at Old Trafford and early years at Real, but added that \"this one was the critical one\". \n \n \"There are players for some matches, there are players for every match and there are players for special matches. The players for special matches are the ones,\" the Portuguese added. \n \n Over to you, Lionel... \n \n Media playback is not supported on this device World Cup Catch-Up: Ronaldo the showman lights up biggest stage \n \n Lionel Messi is another of those ones. Ronaldo's pursuit of greatness has been inextricably linked with that of the Argentina forward, who starts his campaign against Iceland on Saturday. \n \n \"A little sub-plot to it is now the pressure is mounted on Messi's shoulders after watching Cristiano here,\" said Ferdinand. \n \n \"He'll deliver,\" came the reply from Cesc Fabregas on Match of the Day. Fabregas, of course, played with Messi at Barcelona between 2011 and 2014. \n \n Former Scotland winger Pat Nevin said Ronaldo would have \"hated\" the discussions before the tournament about whether this will be Messi's World Cup. \n \n \"Cristiano has raised the bar so Iceland could be in trouble,\" he added. \n \n Level with Puskas - greatness in numbers \n \n This was Ronaldo's 51st hat-trick for club and country, a \"personal best\" according to the man himself. \n \n It comprised his 82nd, 83rd and 84th international goals, putting him joint-second on the all-time list alongside Hungary legend Ferenc Puskas, now trailing only Iran's Ali Daei on 109. \n \n Will he surpass that mark? Or is it a case of when? \n \n Ronaldo also became the first man in history to score in eight consecutive major tournaments with his early penalty against Spain. Where will that streak end? \n \n \"Cristiano is the best in the world and I hope in Qatar once again he is going to score in a World Cup,\" said Portugal coach Fernando Santos, feeling his side's 33-year-old talisman can extend his international career until 2022. \n \n Despite the brilliance of his performance, Ronaldo was quick to try to make his team the focus at the full-time whistle. \n \n \"The most important thing is to highlight what the team has done,\" said Ronaldo. \"The game was about to end and we managed to equalise so we are happy. \n \n \"We are not the favourites so we will try to do our best. The team is doing very well and we are going to do well for sure.\" \n \n Portugal's next Group B game is against Morocco on Wednesday at 13:00 BST, while Spain face Iran at 19:00, no doubt happy to see the back of Ronaldo, for now at least. \n \n \"When you are playing a player like Ronaldo these things can happen,\" said Spain coach Fernando Hierro. \n \n \"It is extremely fortunate for whichever team has him, but I certainly would not change him for any of the players in my squad.\" \n \n Where does it rank? \n \n Ronaldo's hat-trick is likely to become one of the most memorable World Cup moments and this match one of the best in the competition's history. \n \n \"It was one of the best World Cup games I've seen - especially in a group stage. It augurs well for the rest of the World Cup,\" said Match of the Day presenter Gary Lineker. \n \n But where does Ronaldo's performance rank? Here are some of the best individual displays in World Cup history... \n \n Oleg Salenko - Russia 6-1 Cameroon (USA 1994) - Salenko remains the first and only player to score five goals in a single World Cup game. It was enough for him to earn a share of the Golden Boot, even though Russia went out in the first round. \n \n Media playback is not supported on this device Archive: Salenko bags five \n \n Sandor Kocsis - Hungary 8-3 West Germany (Switzerland 1954) - Kocsis followed a hat-trick against South Korea with four in Hungary's group-stage demolition of West Germany. The great Hungarian side seemed destined to be world champions, only to be stunned by the Germans in the final. \n \n Zinedine Zidane - France 3-0 Brazil (France 1998) - Zidane bossed the 1998 final, taking France to the world title on home soil. He scored twice and dismantled defending champions Brazil. \n \n Eusebio - Portugal 5-3 North Korea (England 1966) - North Korea were heading for perhaps the biggest shock of all time when they led Portugal 3-0. Enter Eusebio, who scored four unanswered goals, including two from the spot. \n \n Sir Geoff Hurst - England 4-2 West Germany (England 1966) - To this day still the only hat-trick in a World Cup final, one that carried England to the greatest day in their footballing history and earned Hurst a knighthood. \n \n Media playback is not supported on this device 50 Great World Cup moments: England win the World Cup - 1966 \n \n 'With the God Ronaldo, miracles are possible' - how Portuguese and Spanish media reacted \n \n A young Portugal fan with a poster of his hero \n \n Correio da Manha (Portugal): \"It is not enough to call him king. This Ronaldo of Russia reaches the dimension of God. A giant among small creatures fearful of their gifts, powers and moods. This game with Spain puts Ronaldo on the highest altar of this global religion. Ronaldo achieved immortality.\" \n \n Diario de Noticias (Portugal): Like Eusebio against North Korea in 1966, Pele against France in 1958 or Maradona against England in 1986, CR7's display against Spain in the 2018 World Cup will be for eternity.\" \n \n Publico (Spain): \"Spain has talent but does not have the best in the world. Without a doubt, Spain is a better team than the Portuguese team collectively and individually. But there is no Cristiano Ronaldo. And that made all the difference in this match.\" \n \n El Mundo (Spain): \"Spain survives Cristiano Ronaldo. When there is a huge player in front, the draw is not a bad solution.\" ||||| On Friday morning, meanwhile, only a few hours before the game, it emerged in Spanish news media reports that Ronaldo himself had agreed to pay the Spanish authorities $21.8 million in unpaid taxes. He has also been given a two-year suspended jail sentence, the papers said. It would be hard to believe that these developments did not faze him as the game approached. \n \n Still, it was Ronaldo who gave Portugal the lead, winning and converting a penalty after just four minutes of play. And it was Ronaldo who restored the lead, his shot squirming under David De Gea, the Spanish goalkeeper, as the first half drew to a close. And it was Ronaldo who, with just a few minutes remaining in the second half, lined up a free kick a little outside the Spanish penalty area with Portugal now trailing, 3-2. \n \n He had taken 44 free kicks in previous World Cups. He had scored on none of them. Still, you know what they say: the 45th time\u2019s a charm. \n \n It is true that Ronaldo, at 33, is not the player he was. He is still perfectly sculpted, of course, a Men\u2019s Health magazine cover made flesh, but the electric pace has fizzled a little; he does not cover quite as much ground (only one player, the Portuguese defender Jos\u00e9 Fonte, ran less than Ronaldo in a first half in which one of them scored twice). \n \n But it is equally true to say that Ronaldo, even in his twilight, shines brighter than almost any player with whom he comes into contact. He has not so much faded as a player as evolved into something different. It is misleading to suggest that he has transformed into a striker, a penalty- area predator, because he is not really restricted by such mortal concepts as geography. \n \n Instead, he has attained a level of such devastating efficiency that he now does not really require something so mundane as the ball. He does not need to be involved. He looks, often, like he is doing nothing, or something quite close to it \u2014 as if he is a mere passenger. It is an illusion. He is always in the cockpit. \n \n Isco, his Real Madrid teammate, was the dominant player on the field here, the one who was most involved, who prompted and probed and prodded, and he was wearing a Spain jersey. Ronaldo has moved beyond needing to dictate games. He concerns himself only with defining them. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n His free kick, needless to say, curled artfully, effortlessly, past De Gea and into the corner of Spain\u2019s goal, as Ronaldo \u2014 despite all historical evidence to the contrary \u2014 must have known it would. \n \n Portugal, which is now best thought of as a nation established in 1128 so that it might one day produce Cristiano Ronaldo, would have its draw. More important, the 2018 World Cup had its spark. The afterglow of a game like this can last for a couple of weeks, at least; on this stage, it can resonate around the world. \n \n Spain would have been forgiven for feeling like a victim. It had been the better team in this game, had more of the ball, created more opportunities, played the slicker, smoother soccer. \n \n It had looked every inch a contender for a World Cup title and nothing like a side still reeling from Lopetegui\u2019s departure, shaken to its core by a dispute between its players and their ultimate bosses at the country\u2019s federation, having to adjust to life under a new coach who, until now, had only managed one second-division team. \n \n That Spain\u2019s players did not let all this deter them on Friday only served to emphasize the scale of Ronaldo\u2019s performance and the overall quality of the match. \n \n And when the final whistle blew, the stadium stood: not just the clusters of Portuguese fans, not just the neutrals and the Russians, but the Spanish fans, too, in those blood-red jerseys. They applauded their own team, of course; there was enough encouragement there to see the bigger picture, to believe that the tumult of the last few days may not be fatal to their hopes. \n \n But when Spain\u2019s players had left the field, and Portugal\u2019s stood in the center circle, the Spanish fans remained standing, and they kept clapping, as every single Portuguese player sought out Ronaldo, to clasp his hand, to ruffle his hair, as though just to touch him was to brush against something holy. \n \n They do not mind that he attracts \u2014 demands, really \u2014 all of the attention. They do not mind being in the supporting cast, just as those Spanish fans did not mind providing the audience for the three acts of his one-man show. Sometimes, it is a pleasure simply to be there; sometimes, it is a pleasure just to sit back and watch. And at the end, sometimes there is nothing to do but applaud. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u25a0 Here\u2019s how it happened: \n \n Full Time: Spain 3, Ronaldo 3 \n \n Ronaldo has produced one of the most remarkable individual performances you could possibly hope to see, and illuminated what will take some beating as the best game of the tournament. Portugal hasn\u2019t been discussed much as a contender for the World Cup, despite being European champion. This may have been an oversight. \n \n 90 + 2\u2019: Portugal Almost Pulls Away \n \n Quaresa almost wins it! He walks the ball through the Spanish defense, into the penalty area, around two defenders. But the third arrives in the nick of time to smother his shot. What a winner that might have been. I think we all \u2014 players, coaches, fans, viewers \u2014 need a whistle, a beer and a shower at this point. \n \n 88\u2019: GOAL! Ronaldo Equalizes \n \n Oh woooooowwwwwwww! Ronaldo completes his hat trick with a stunning free kick, curled around the wall\u2019s right edge. De Gea never had a chance. It\u2019s 3-3. Message from the office in New York: \u201cCan they just keep playing, please?\u201d \n \n 86\u2019: Sloppy Spain \n \n Now it\u2019s Spain that gives away a silly free kick, as Piqu\u00e9, who had Ronaldo corralled with his back to goal, shoves him down. \n \n 84\u2019: A Clasico Moment \n \n A little Barcelona-Real Madrid spice as Ronaldo throws the ball to Jordi Alba, who was coming to take it for a throw-in. You can take the boys out of the Clasico, but you can\u2019t take the Clasico out of the boys. \n \n 82\u2019: Just When You Think Spain Is Sitting Back ... \n \n Isco adds some rare excitement at the other end, squeezing off a low shot that Rui Patricio handles with ease. \n \n 79\u2019: Danger in the Area \n \n A long, bounding ball from Portugal\u2019s end results in a collision of Ronaldo, De Gea and Piqu\u00e9, who appears to take the brunt of a collision with a goalkeeper and a bronze statue in full sprint. The ball, most important if you\u2019re Spanish, winds up cleared in the interaction, and a handball by Quaresma trying to collect it allows everyone to exhale. \n \n That ball seemed to catch everyone but Ronaldo by surprise, and he nearly made Spain pay for their momentary confusion. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n 76\u2019: Spain Puts on the Clamps \n \n It\u2019s easy to get lulled into this thriller, but Spain has quietly settled into two banks of four defensively. For a team that knows how to pick a lock on offense, they also know how to clamp down when it counts. \n \n 70\u2019: Portugal Makes Changes \n \n Joao Mario and Ricardo Quaresma come on for Portugal, now seeking fresh legs and, most important, a goal with 20 minutes left. Spain brings on Bayern Munich\u2019s Thiago Alc\u00e1ntara for Iniesta \u2014 young legs for aging ones. \n \n 64\u2019: Spain-Portugal Delivers \n \n This would have been a super World Cup final: tense, dramatic, goal-filled. A terrific game. Though, to be fair, awarding the trophy tonight before 24 teams kicked a ball might cause problems at the next FIFA Congress. \n \n Photo \n \n 58\u2019 GOAL! Nacho Gives Spain the Lead \n \n Nacho steps into a failed clearance, puts his laces into the ball and pings both posts with a shot through traffic. A rocket and, for the moment, a potential winner. \n \n 55\u2019: GOAL! Diego Costa Makes Portugal Pay \n \n And that\u2019s what happens when you give away free kicks easily. GOAL! Free kick is rolled into play, lofted to Busquets at the right post, and he nods it into the path of Costa. He\u2019s got two now, just like Ronaldo, and we\u2019ve got a game again. Spain: 2, Portugal: 2, All of us: happy. \n \n Rory Smith: Diego Costa has been Spain\u2019s great conundrum in the last few years: he offers a threat the rest of the team simply doesn\u2019t possess, but he\u2019s always struggled to be himself in a context that is so alien, and a style so unfamiliar. If Fernando Hierro has solved that in two days, maybe he should have got the Real Madrid job. \n \n 53\u2019: Spain\u2019s Strategy ... \n \n Spain\u2019s back to playing keepaway. Their possession can lull defenses to sleep and they know it. Enough of it, and an opponent without focus can be coaxed into bad positions, bad decisions, bad fouls out of frustration. That was one right there, and now, just like that, Spain has a dangerous free kick from 30 yards. \n \n 46\u2019: More Entertainment on the Way? \n \n The teams are back and here we go. Let\u2019s hope the second half is even half as good as that first 45 was. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Was just wondering how many goals Ronaldo would have by now if he\u2019d been fined, say, $50 million this morning by the Spanish tax man. \n \n Photo \n \n Halftime: Two Ronaldo Goals Give Portugal the Lead \n \n Cristiano Ronaldo scores early \u2014 a fourth-minute penalty \u2014 and late \u2014 on a 44th-minute blunder by Spain\u2019s goalkeeper \u2014 and Portugal leads the Iberian Derby in Sochi, 2-1 at the break. Spain was solid except for the two times it wasn\u2019t, and Ronaldo \u2014 an assassin of a forward who seems to get better with age \u2014 was there each time to pounce. \n \n 44\u2019: GOAL! Ronaldo Does it Again \n \n A howler from De Gea and Portugal leads 2-1. Ronaldo gets the ball near the top of the area, and wangles a hard low shot at De Gea. Eminently savable, he instead lets it skip off him and in. That\u2019s a terrible mistake from an outstanding goalkeeper, and it\u2019s cost his team badly here in the closing second of the half. \n \n Rory Smith: This will be no solace for David De Gea \u2014 who really does not make mistakes like that \u2014 but this is the game the World Cup needed. Spain has been breathtaking at times, but there\u2019s a resilience to Portugal, a nous, that makes them a threat. And they have this guy upfront: tall, tan, who looks to have quite the career ahead of him. \n \n 42\u2019: Pepe\u2019s Not Really Sorry \n \n One of the eternal truths of world soccer is that when Pepe fouls a guy from behind and then helps him up and says \u201csorry,\u201d he\u2019s probably not. The same truism applies to Sergio Ramos and probably a dozen other players you can think of off the top of your head. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But he\u2019s got the angle fractionally wrong, and while Rui Patricio dives to make it look good in the photos, the ball was always going wide. \n \n The contrast in attacking styles tonight is remarkable: Spain attacks like a molasses spill \u2014 slowly and steadily creeping forward, ever forward, inch by inch \u2014 applying more and more pressure, hoping something finally cracks, and they\u2019re in. Portugal, on the other hand, waits and waits and then breaks out like a stolen Ferrari on the counterattack. \n \n Photo \n \n 30\u2019: VAR Does its Job \n \n They finally show the replay of the Spanish shot off the bar, and it wasn\u2019t close to crossing the line when it came down. Goal line technology, introduced at the World Cup in 2014, does its job. I\u2019ve never seen it fall to be honest. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Fernando Hierro, by the way, is prowling the Spain coaching box in shirt sleeves like he wants to check in to the game. Gesturing, clapping, stalking. \n \n 29\u2019: Silva Hits the Wall \n \n Silva stands over the free kick with Koke as the referee sets the wall. Silva right, Koke left. But the shot finds the wall like a magnet. \n \n 26\u2019: Spain Almost Scores Again \n \n Was that in?? We\u2019ll review. A Spanish shot rockets off the crossbar and down off the line \u2014 Georff Hurst-style \u2014 but a second look says no, it didn\u2019t go in. And again play moves on. \n \n 24\u2019: GOAL! Diego Costa Levels for Spain \n \n Diego Costa gets behind the defense and dances around two defenders until he can get a look at the goal. Spotting it, he buries a shot past Rui Patricio. \n \n Rory Smith: Spain\u2019s reputation for delicacy is well-earned, but occasionally a little bit of brute force is required: Diego Costa bulldozes (just about fairly) through Pepe, twists and turns until he sees a glimmer of goal, and then arrows a shot past Rui Patricio. This is better than Iran against Morocco. \n \n 21\u2019: Spain Threatens, but Misses \n \n We\u2019re spending a bit more time in Portugal\u2019s end here as Spain probes the Portuguese defense at its leisure. Now Iniesta spots a crease and dashes into on the left. He takes the ball to the end line and cuts it back for Silva, but his shot goes wide. \n \n 17\u2019: Free Kick for Ronaldo \n \n Sergio Busquets loses a ball on the left side and, compounding his mistake, picks up a yellow. Ronaldo stands over the free kick. \n \n Ronaldo slams it into the wall, half of Portugal\u2019s team calls for a handball, but the referee, Italy\u2019s Gianluca Rocchi, isn\u2019t having it. He points the other way, and Spain is playing keepaway again. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n 16\u2019: Spain Tries to Find Comfort Zone \n \n A little more possession for Spain here, which is their comfort zone. Quick one touch stuff: here you have it, oh no you take it back, no you, really, no you, OK, I\u2019ll look over here, oh never mind here\u2019s the ball back. But it might settle them a bit. \n \n 14\u2019: Ronaldo in Charge \n \n The crowd roars audibly literally every time Ronaldo touches the ball. He\u2019s the star here, a spotlight that as we all know he doesn\u2019t like. (I\u2019m totally kidding; he looooooooves it.) \n \n 11\u2019: Clock Games \n \n Ruo Patricio almost seems like he\u2019s time-wasting after collecting a deep ball, picking it up, dropping it, picking it up again. Which would be the funniest thing ever considering it\u2019s THE ELEVENTH MINUTE. \n \n Spain is wearing white today, btw, and Portugal is in Spain\u2019s traditional red shirts. It\u2019s a little disconcerting. \n \n 10\u2019: Spain Tries to Recover \n \n The ball falls to David Silva after a hopeful cross into the penalty area, and he slashes at it with his right foot and skies it over the bar. \n \n The look on his face after that miss surely matches all of Spain\u2019s, a nation trying to figure out how such a hopeful summer could go so wrong so far. \n \n 3\u2019: Goal! Ronaldo Makes Spain Pay \n \n Well, we said there would be drama, and that\u2019s it from the start. A foul, a whistle and a penalty for Ronaldo! He converts, and just like that Spain\u2019s World Cup somehow manages to get even worse. \n \n Photo \n \n Rory Smith: Four minutes in, Portugal leads, through what looked, at first glance, like something of a soft penalty. Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s dancing feet enticed Nacho \u2014 his Real Madrid teammate \u2014 into what was definitely a foolish tackle; the forward threw himself to the floor after what was probably fairly minimal contact, and then dusted himself down to convert the spot-kick. His celebration \u2014 stroking his chin \u2014 may have been a G.O.A.T. reference. More on that as we get it. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The First Heavyweight Match of the World Cup \n \n There\u2019s a buoyant atmosphere in Sochi ahead of the first really heavyweight meeting of the 2018 World Cup \u2014 an Iberian derby between Spain and Portugal. It\u2019s been easy to miss the European fans in Russia so far \u2014 the Latin American contingents are more numerous and, if we\u2019re honest, louder \u2014 but there are plenty from both countries in the baking heat of Sochi, on the lip of the Black Sea. The stadium is pretty much full, too, which is kind of a relief, after both of today\u2019s other games were pockmarked by empty seats. \u2014 Rory Smith \n \n Spain\u2019s New Coach Deals With Drama \n \n Spain\u2019s new coach, Fernando Hierro, has stepped into a bit of a mess before this game, but he told reporters this week that Spain had no time to dwell on it. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve come to fight for the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a great opportunity and that should be the focus.\u201d \n \n Hierro understands the stage; he made four World Cup teams and played in three for Spain. He said this week that he took over the team in its time of crisis out of a sense of duty. \u201cWhen the president told me the possibility, I had three choices: to say no, another was to go and the third was to stay, to take a step forward for the Spanish federation and for Spanish soccer,\u201d he said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t say no because I would not forgive myself.\u201d \n \n Spain vs. Portugal Starting Lineups \n \n The lineups are out in Sochi, and both include household names: \n \n For Spain: De Gea; Nacho, Piqu\u00e9, Ramos, Alba; Busquets, Koke, Iniesta; Isco, Silva; Diego Costa. \n \n One player who may have been lost in all the drama is Spain goalkeeper David De Gea. He\u2019s among the best in the world at his position, and he just signed a new five-year deal to stay at Manchester United. So that should clear his head just in time to face Ronaldo. \n \n For Portugal: Patricio, Soares, Fonte, Pepe, Guerreiro, B Silva, Carvalho, Moutinho, Fernandes, Guedes, Ronaldo \n \n They\u2019ll have a lot to live up to: the day\u2019s first two games both ended with dramatic late winners. The soccer, however, should be a bit smoother from these two. For the sake of everyone, let\u2019s hope it\u2019s Ronaldo and Iniesta and David Silva and Bernardo Silva we\u2019re talking about later, and not something Pepe or Sergio Ramos has done. ||||| Published on Jun 15, 2018 \n \n The FIFA World Cup\u2122 Goal of the Day, sponsored by Powerade. \n \n \n \n SUBSCRIBE to get the latest FOX Soccer content: http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXSOCCER \n \n \n \n \u25baTop 100 World Cup Moments: https://foxs.pt/Top100WorldCupMoments \n \n \u25ba2018 FIFA World Cup\u2122 - Everything You Need to Know: \n \n https://foxs.pt/2018FIFAWorldCup101 \n \n \u25baChampions League Highlights 2017-18: http://foxs.pt/FOXSOCCERChampionsLeague \n \n \u25baBundesliga Highlights & Features 2017-18: http://foxs.pt/FOXSOCCERBundesliga \n \n \n \n About FOX Soccer: \n \n With exclusive highlights, original programming, and behind the scenes footage, FOX Soccer\u2019s YouTube channel provides the sports content that fans are hungry for.

He scored three times, including one with about 2 minutes left in regulation, to lift Portugal into a 3-3 tie with Spain in their World Cup opener. The feat makes him, at age 33 years and 131 days, the oldest player to notch a World Cup hat trick, notes ESPN. He's also only the fourth player ever to score in four World Cups. Ronaldo's first two goals weren't perhaps of the write-home-about-it variety, including one that went in with help from Spain's goalie, but the third one was incredible, per the BBC. It came on a free kick, and you can watch it here. The New York Times' headline on all this refers to a \"draw for the ages, starring a player for all time.\"",

He is relentless in his pursuit of greatness. What he is doing on the world stage is ridiculous.\" Bleacher Report's take on Ronaldo's performance: \"The first was a penalty he won himself, his nifty prompting Nacho to dangle a leg over which Ronaldo gleefully fell. The second was a gift from David De Gea, who pushed his edge-of-the-box snap shot over the goal line, though again, there's something to be said for Ronaldo's alertness on the break that he was there to capitalize on Goncalo Guedes' layoff following Pepe's defensive clearance. The third was a magisterial free kick that disappeared into the top corner, leaving De Gea flat-footed.\"",

The source said that the main consideration was the site\u2019s employees \u2013 that BuzzFeed could not countenance \u201chaving employees make ads, or working at the company and having our site promoting things, that limit our freedom and make it harder for them to live their lives.\u201d \n \n Asked if the site would rule out any Trump advertising, the source said the specifics would matter: \u201cIn general, we have taken the position that we won\u2019t take ads for his presidential campaign.\u201d \n \n In an email to staff on Monday, BuzzFeed founder and CEO Jonah Peretti explained that in April, the RNC and BuzzFeed signed an agreement to \"spend a significant amount on political advertisements slated to run during the Fall election cycle.\" But since Trump became the nominee his campaign has proven themselves to be \"directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States,\" because of proposed bans on Muslim immigration and comments about descendants of immigrants, among other policies. \n \n \"We don't need to and do not expect to agree with the positions or values of all our advertisers.

Reporters at the site told POLITICO that the decision likely won't change their relationships with the campaign, which they described as already strained. \n \n It's also far from the first time the site has taken a position on a topic. In early 2012, BuzzFeed blacked out parts of their site in solidarity with the protest against the Stop Online Piracy Act. Following the Supreme Court ruling in 2015 which legalized same sex marriage, the site changed its logo to the rainbow flag colors, which are a symbol of the gay pride movement. Smith said at the time: \"We firmly believe that for a number of issues, including civil rights, women\u2019s rights, anti-racism, and LGBT equality, there are not two sides.\" \n \n Other websites have taken stands against Trump as well. The Huffington Post adds a note to each of its politics articles about the Republican nominee, calling him \"serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther.\" \n \n A spokesperson for The Huffington Post told POLITICO \"We've made our stance on Trump clear from the very beginning and will not be running any Trump for President ads,\" when asked if the site would follow Buzzfeed's decision. \n \n A spokesperson for BuzzFeed declined to comment on the size of the ad buy or on any further details about the ad buy. \n \n We've reached out to the Trump campaign further comment, and will update here accordingly. \n \n Read the full memo below: \n \n \"Hello BuzzFeeders, \n \n I wanted to share with you a business decision we have made regarding the Trump for President campaign and why we made it. \n \n In April, the Republican National Committee signed an agreement with BuzzFeed to spend a significant amount on political advertisements slated to run during the Fall election cycle. As you know, we accept advertisements from both republican and democratic candidates and we were pleased to accept this advertising order from the RNC. \n \n Since signing this advertising deal, Donald Trump, as you know, has become the presumptive nominee of his party. The tone and substance of his campaign are unique in the history of modern US politics. Trump advocates banning Muslims from traveling to the United States, he's threatened to limit the free press, and made offensive statements toward women, immigrants, descendants of immigrants, and foreign nationals. \n \n Earlier today Buzzfeed informed the RNC that we would not accept Trump for President ads and that we would be terminating our agreement with them.

As more and more people come forward with allegations against powerful people and some of those powerful people lose their jobs, some have called the moment in history a tipping point ; others have called it a reckoning . And while many are being taken to task for their alleged misconduct and there is potential for a cultural shift in the way we view sexual harassment and assault, this isn't the first time women have publicly spoken out against alleged harassers. In 1991, law professor Anita Hill sat before the Senate Judiciary Committee, led by Senator Joe Biden , and detailed the alleged harassment she experienced from her boss, Clarence Thomas, who was just about to be confirmed as a Supreme Court Justice. Throughout Hill's testimony, she weathered attacks on her character and her trustworthiness from those on the Senate panel, and many have blamed Biden for allowing those attacks and failing to do more. Nearly three decades after her testimony, and after Thomas was seated on the court, Biden wants Anita Hill to know that he's sorry. \n \n In an interview with Teen Vogue 's editor in chief, Elaine Welteroth, Biden said there are a few things he would do differently if he could go back and redo those Anita Hill hearings. \n \n \"I believed Anita Hill. I voted against Clarence Thomas. And I insisted the next election \u2014 I campaigned for two women Senators on the condition that if they won they would come on the Judiciary Committee, so there would never be again all men making a judgment on this,\" Biden said. \"And my one regret is that I wasn\u2019t able to tone down the attacks on her by some of my Republican friends. I mean, they really went after her. As much as I tried to intervene, I did not have the power to gavel them out of order. I tried to be like a judge and only allow a question that would be relevant to ask.\" \n \n But ultimately, Biden said he wasn't able to do enough. \n \n \"I wasn\u2019t able to convince three women we\u2019d subpoenaed to cooperate with testimony. At the last minute, they changed their mind and said they wouldn\u2019t do it. I had them sign an affidavit saying, \u2018I want you to come, and you\u2019re saying, \u201cNo, I will not come.\u201c\u2018 In retrospect, some, including Anita, think I should have subpoenaed them no matter what,\" he said. \"The reason I didn\u2019t: I was worried they would come and not corroborate what she said and make \u2014 I mean, Clarence Thomas won by only two votes. And we still thought we had a chance at beating him.\" \n \n \"I wish I had been able to do more for Anita Hill,\" he said. \"I owe her an apology.\" \n \n Many, including Hill, have criticized Biden for allowing some of the remarks those on the Committee made, including insinuations that Thomas allegedly talking about women's breast sizes was \"not too bad,\" according to The Washington Post. Some even said Biden's tone with Hill bordered on disbelief of her accusations. According to Politico , the hearing was \"seen as Biden's subjecting an African-American woman to public humiliation and abuse.\" In fact, Biden has offered public apologies to Hill before , but she has said it wasn't enough. \n \n \"I still don\u2019t think it takes ownership of his role in what happened,\" Hill said in a recent interview with The Washington Post . \"And he also doesn\u2019t understand that it wasn\u2019t just that I felt it was not fair. It was that women were looking to the Senate Judiciary Committee and his leadership to really open the way to have these kinds of hearings. They should have been using best practices to show leadership on this issue on behalf of women\u2019s equality. And they did just the opposite.\" \n \n \"You cannot just bring people forward into a process where you know they\u2019re not going to be treated fairly,\" she continued. \"That\u2019s not being heard.\" \n \n In the Post interview, Hill said truly being heard is what women are grappling with today during the #MeToo movement. Biden told Teen Vogue something similar. \n \n \"We\u2019re now at a point here where we have a chance to change the culture,\" he said. Biden was clear that harassment is a part of our culture, deeply ingrained and even normalized to a point where we sometimes don't even notice it. Through his work on college campuses and involving men in the effort to prevent sexual violence through his It's on Us campaign, Biden said he hopes he's able to make some headway toward the sea change that's clearly coming. \n \n \"I\u2019ve gotten asked by press a lot of the last 23 years, how will I know when I\u2019ve succeeded. We will have succeeded when not a single woman who is abused ever, ever, ever asks herself, What did I do?\" he said. \"We\u2019ve got to change it.

Francis also believes some of the statements that allegedly constitute defamation were made in a court proceeding where Francis was seeking a restraining order against Wynn and were therefore privileged. ||||| A Los Angeles jury on Monday awarded casino mogul Steve Wynn $20 million, after it found that he had been defamed by \"Girls Gone Wild\" creator Joe Francis. \n \n Wynn had sued Francis over the latter's claims that Wynn had threatened to have him killed and buried in the desert. Testifying last week, Wynn called the accusation a \"terrible lie\" that could potentially hurt his reputation and that of his eponymous company. \n \n \"He's unrepentant, vicious, out-of-control,\" Wynn said of Francis. \n \n But since Wynn filed suit in 2010, Francis has maintained that the threat was real. He said music mogul Quincy Jones, his neighbor and a longtime friend of Wynn's, told him that Wynn wanted Francis dead in an email. \n \n In court, Jones said that Wynn never threatened to kill Francis, and that Jones had never told Francis that Wynn had. \n \n Francis' team has never produced the email; Wynn said that's because it doesn't exist. \n \n The Wynn-Francis feud stretches over a number of years and multiple lawsuits. Francis attorney David Houston has suggested that their fraught history is what riled Wynn enough to threaten Francis. \n \n Francis made the death-threat accusations while warring with Wynn over a roughly $2-million gambling debt Francis had racked up. Francis and Wynn also battled in court over Francis' accusations that he was plied with prostitutes and drugs during his betting spree. (A Nevada judge sided with Wynn in a lawsuit over those claims.) \n \n In questioning Wynn, Houston tried to prove that the mogul, considered a sort of elder statesman in the gaming industry, was capable of spouting off threats. Houston played part of an interview from the 1980s in which Wynn told TV reporter Meredith Vieira that he'd choke her if she didn't include certain information in her report. \n \n \"I think you heard her laugh,\" Wynn said. \n \n \"Or gasp,\" Houston replied. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Glendale bear still in a cage; move to Colorado on hold \n \n Amanda Bynes charged in two alleged hit-and-run incidents \n \n Marines accused of assaulting man outside gay bar in Long Beach \n \n \u2014 Harriet Ryan and Ashley Powers \n \n Photo: Joe Francis, left, and Steve Wynn.

    "document": "Colbert joke prompts thousands of FCC complaints from all political stripes \n \n Disgruntled viewers of Stephen Colbert\u2019s late-night show on CBS complained to the FCC that a sexually explicit joke about President Donald Trump and his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin is \u201cbeneath the dignity of American broadcasting,\u201d and urged the agency to sanction the network. \n \n A sample of the more than 5,700 complaints that flooded the agency since Colbert\u2019s joke on the May 1 episode of \u201cThe Late Show\u201d included concerns about indecency, hate speech and homophobia from across the political spectrum. Colbert used a crude term to refer to a metaphorical sexual relationship between the U.S. and Russian presidents in a monologue on Trump\u2019s first 100 days in office. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n The FCC, in response to a POLITICO Freedom of Information Act request, released samples of the complaints, with the names of the people who submitted them redacted but their geographic locations intact. The agency provided the first 100 complaints received between May 2 and May 17. \n \n Parents complained about answering questions from their kids, while one viewer thanked God \u201cmy children, elderly parents, and other loved ones did not see the dispicable (sic) display of vitriol that spewed from his hateful mouth!\u201d \n \n Some viewers argued that Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama wouldn\u2019t be the butt of a similar joke, and complained that Trump was unfairly targeted by the media. \n \n \u201cI know all you Commie shills hate this president but it is your job to keep these Leftists from dragging this nation further into the gutter,\u201d one complaint from St. Petersburg, Fla. said. \n \n Several raised qualms about what they viewed as the homophobic nature of the joke: \u201cBy using accusations of being gay as an insult, it implied that there is something wrong with being gay,\u201d an Urbana, Ill. viewer wrote. \n \n \u201cThere is nothing wrong with two men who love each other,\u201d one complaint, from a trans man who identifies as homosexual, said. \u201cI don't like Trump but I also don't like anti-homosexual comments being aired for millions of people to see. I have to say, shame on you for allowing this.\u201d \n \n \u201cI really thought we left this kind of bigotry in the wastebin of history,\u201d a New York City viewer said. \u201cInstead I have to endure it during dinner with me and my husband's son.\u201d \n \n Many of the complaints called for fines against Colbert and CBS, but lawyers familiar with the FCC\u2019s indecency and obscenity rules say that\u2019s not going to happen. \n \n FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has said the agency is reviewing the complaints. Such a review is standard protocol for the FCC, and doesn\u2019t imply the complaints have merit. Pai declined to give an update on the review when asked Thursday at a press conference following a commission meeting. \n \n The number of complaints about Colbert's joke is dwarfed by the more than half a million the agency received over Janet Jackson's \"wardrobe malfunction\" during the halftime show of the 2004 Super Bowl on CBS. \n \n Morning Media Your guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

The FCC would have to prove the joke was obscene, and as broadcast attorney David Oxenford wrote in a blog post on the subject, \u201cfor a program to be obscene, it needs to be really bad.\u201d \n \n \u201cA television program like that in question here is never going to be found obscene \u2014 the words describing the specific sexual act itself was bleeped out of the broadcast, the description was not designed to appeal to prurient interests (sexual interests \u2014 it was not delivered in such an explicit way as to appeal solely to sexual interest), and it did have social significance \u2014 it was delivered in a politically motivated statement,\u201d Oxenford wrote. \u201cUnder these circumstances, the extremely rigorous obscenity test simply would not be met.\u201d \n \n Schwartzman was even more blunt, \u201cThere is zero chance the FCC would even dream of bringing a obscenity case against this. ...

Some experts say it needs to keep up the tough talk, even if it understands that its efforts at the Security Council may not do much to limit the North\u2019s capabilities.

Security Council held an emergency meeting at which its members, including China, \"strongly condemned\" the test and vowed to start work on appropriate measures in response, the president of the council said. \n \n North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, the third of his line to rule the country, has presided over two long-range rocket launches and a nuclear test during his first year in power, pursuing policies that have propelled his impoverished and malnourished country closer to becoming a nuclear weapons power. \n \n North Korea said the test had \"greater explosive force\" than those it conducted in 2006 and 2009. Its KCNA news agency said it had used a \"miniaturized\" and lighter nuclear device, indicating it had again used plutonium, which is suitable for use as a missile warhead. \n \n China, which has shown signs of increasing exasperation with the recent bellicose tone of its reclusive neighbor, summoned the North Korean ambassador in Beijing and protested sternly, the Foreign Ministry said. \n \n Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said China was \"strongly dissatisfied and resolutely opposed\" to the test and urged North Korea to \"stop any rhetoric or acts that could worsen situations and return to the right course of dialogue and consultation as soon as possible\". \n \n Analysts said the test was a major embarrassment to China, which is a permanent member of the Security Council and North Korea's sole major economic and diplomatic ally. \n \n Obama called the test a \"highly provocative act\" that hurt regional stability. \n \n \"The danger posed by North Korea's threatening activities warrants further swift and credible action by the international community. The United States will also continue to take steps necessary to defend ourselves and our allies,\" Obama said. \n \n U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said Washington and its allies intended to \"augment the sanctions regime\" already in place due to Pyongyang's previous atomic tests. North Korea is already one of the most heavily sanctioned states in the world and has few external economic links that can be targeted. \n \n Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the test was a \"grave threat\" that could not be tolerated. \n \n Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov urged North Korea to abandon its nuclear arms program and return to talks. NATO condemned the test as an \"irresponsible act.\" \n \n South Korea, still technically at war with North Korea after a 1950-53 civil war ended in a mere truce, also denounced the test. Obama spoke to South Korean President Lee Myung-bak on Tuesday and told him the United States \"remains steadfast in its defense commitments\" to Korea, the White House said. \n \n MAXIMUM RESTRAINT \n \n North Korea's Foreign Ministry said the test was \"only the first response we took with maximum restraint\". \n \n \"If the United States continues to come out with hostility and complicates the situation, we will be forced to take stronger, second and third responses in consecutive steps,\" it said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. \n \n North Korea - which gave the U.S. State Department advance warning of the test - often threatens the United States and its \"puppet\", South Korea, with destruction in colorful terms. \n \n North Korea told the U.N. disarmament forum in Geneva that it would never bow to resolutions on its nuclear program and that prospects were \"gloomy\" for the denuclearization of the divided Korean peninsula because of a \"hostile\" U.S. policy. \n \n Suzanne DiMaggio, an analyst at the Asia Society in New York, said North Korea had embarrassed China with the test. \"China's inability to dissuade North Korea from carrying through with this third nuclear test reveals Beijing's limited influence over Pyongyang's actions in unusually stark terms,\" she said. \n \n Mark Fitzpatrick of the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank, said: \"The test is hugely insulting to China, which now can be expected to follow through with threats to impose sanctions.\" \n \n The magnitude of the explosion was roughly twice that of the 2009 test, according to the Vienna-based Comprehensive Nuclear-Test Ban Treaty Organization. The U.S. Geological Survey said that a seismic event measuring 5.1 magnitude had occurred. \n \n U.S. intelligence agencies were analyzing the event and found that North Korea probably conducted an underground nuclear explosion with a yield of \"approximately several kilotons\", the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said. \n \n Nuclear experts have described Pyongyang's previous two tests as puny by international standards. The yield of the 2006 test has been estimated at less than 1 kiloton (1,000 tons of TNT equivalent) and the second at some 2-7 kilotons, compared with 20 kilotons for a Nagasaki-type bomb. \n \n Initial indications are that the test involved the latest version of a plutonium-based prototype weapon, according to one current and one former U.S. national security official. Both previous tests involved plutonium. If it turns out the test was of a new uranium-based weapon, it would show that North Korea has made more progress on uranium enrichment than previously thought. \n \n The United States uses WC-135 Constant Phoenix \"sniffer\" aircraft to collect samples to identify nuclear explosions. These would need to be deployed quickly to detect whether highly enriched uranium rather than plutonium was used because uranium decays to undetectable levels within a matter of days. Plutonium takes much longer to decay. \n \n North Korea trumpeted news of the test on its state television channel to patriotic music against a backdrop of its national flag. \n \n \"It was confirmed that the nuclear test that was carried out at a high level in a safe and perfect manner using a miniaturized and lighter nuclear device with greater explosive force than previously did not pose any negative impact on the surrounding ecological environment,\" KCNA said. \n \n North Korea linked the test to its technical prowess in launching a long-range rocket in December, a move that triggered the U.N. sanctions, backed by China, that Pyongyang said prompted it to take Tuesday's action. \n \n The North's ultimate aim, Washington believes, is to design an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead that could hit the United States. North Korea says the program is aimed at putting satellites in space. \n \n Despite its three nuclear tests and long-range rocket tests, North Korea is not believed to be close to manufacturing a nuclear missile capable of hitting the United States. \n \n It used plutonium in previous nuclear tests and before Tuesday there had been speculation that it would use highly enriched uranium so as to conserve its plutonium stocks, as testing eats into its limited supply of materials to construct a nuclear bomb. \n \n \"VICIOUS CYCLE\" \n \n When Kim Jong-un, who is 30, took power after his father's death in December 2011, there were hopes that he would bring reforms and end Kim Jong-il's \"military first\" policies. \n \n Instead, North Korea, whose economy is smaller than it was 20 years ago and where a third of children are believed to be malnourished, appears to be trapped in a cycle of sanctions followed by further provocations. \n \n \"The more North Korea shoots missiles, launches satellites or conducts nuclear tests, the more the U.N. Security Council will impose new and more severe sanctions,\" said Shen Dingli, a professor at Shanghai's Fudan University. \"It is an endless, vicious cycle.\" \n \n Options for the international community appear to be in short supply. Diplomats at the United Nations said negotiations on new sanctions could take weeks since China is likely to resist tough new measures for fear they could lead to further retaliation by the North Korean leadership. \n \n Beijing has also been concerned that tougher sanctions could further weaken North Korea's economy and prompt a flood of refugees into China. \n \n Tuesday's action appeared to have been timed for the run-up to February 16 anniversary celebrations of Kim Jong-il's birthday, as well as to achieve maximum international attention. \n \n Significantly, the test comes at a time of political transition in China, Japan and South Korea, and as Obama begins his second term. The U.S. president will likely have to tweak his State of the Union address due to be given on Tuesday. \n \n Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is bedding down a new government and South Korea's new president, Park Geun-hye, is preparing to take office on February 25. \n \n China too is in the midst of a once-in-a-decade leadership transition to Xi Jinping, who takes office in March. Both Abe and Xi are staunch nationalists. \n \n The longer-term game plan from Pyongyang may be to restart international talks aimed at winning food and financial aid. China urged it to return to the stalled \"six-party\" talks on its nuclear program, hosted by China and including the two Koreas, the United States, Japan and Russia. \n \n Its puny economy and small diplomatic reach mean that North Korea struggles to win attention on the global stage - other than through nuclear tests and attacks on South Korea, the last of which was made in 2010. \n \n \"Now the next step for North Korea will be to offer talks... - any form to start up discussion again to bring things to their advantage,\" predicted Jeung Young-tae, senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul. \n \n (Additional reporting by Jack Kim, Christine Kim and Jumin Park in SEOUL; Linda Sieg in TOKYO; Louis Charbonneau and Michelle Nichols at the UNITED NATIONS; Fredrik Dahl in VIENNA; Michael Martina and Chen Aizhu in BEIJING; Mette Fraende in COPENHAGEN; Adrian Croft, Charlie Dunmore and Justyna Pawlak in BRUSSELS; Mark Hosenball, Paul Eckert, Roberta Rampton, Tabassum Zakaria and Jeff Mason in WASHINGTON; Editing by Nick Macfie, Claudia Parsons and David Brunnstrom) ||||| The statement from the Foreign Ministry reflects Beijing's growing frustration with its communist neighbor's provocative behavior, as well as its reluctance to impose more severe measures that could destabilize the North's hardline regime. \n \n \"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea, heedless of widespread international opposition, has again carried out a nuclear test, to which the Chinese government expresses its firm opposition,\" the statement said, referring to North Korea by its official name. \n \n The statement said China maintained its resolute stance of advocating a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula, opposition to nuclear proliferation, and support for the maintenance of stability on the peninsula. It called on North Korea to abide by its denuclearization pledge, and not to \"take additional actions that could cause the situation to further deteriorate.\" \n \n The statement did not point to any specific actions Beijing would take in response to the nuclear test, the North's third.

    "document": "BEIJING (AP) \u2014 China's currency fell further Wednesday following a surprise change in its exchange rate mechanism that rattled global markets and threatens to fan trade tensions with the United States and Europe. \n \n In this Tuesday, Aug. 11, 2015 photo, a bank clerk counts Chinese currency notes at a bank outlet in Huaibei in central China's Anhui province. China\u2019s surprise move on Tuesday to devalue its currency... (Associated Press) \n \n In this Tuesday, Aug. 11, 2015 photo, a bank clerk counts Chinese currency notes as her colleague attends a customer at a bank outlet in Huaibei in central China's Anhui province. China\u2019s surprise move... (Associated Press) \n \n The central bank said the yuan's 1.9 percent devaluation Tuesday against the U.S. dollar, which was its biggest one-day fall in a decade, was due to changes aimed at making the tightly controlled currency more market-oriented. That raised the prospect of still more declines, which would help struggling Chinese exporters at the expense of foreign competitors and might shore up flagging economic growth. \n \n On Wednesday, the yuan dropped another 1.6 percent. In theory, it could drop 2 percent every day given it can trade 2 percent around a rate that is set based on the previous day's closing value. \n \n Until now, China has set the yuan's value each day based on a basket of currencies that is believed to be dominated by the U.S. dollar. That meant the yuan rose as the dollar jumped over the past year, hurting its exporters and raising the threat of politically dangerous job losses. Exports in July plummeted by an unexpectedly steep 8.3 percent from a year earlier. \n \n The People's Bank of China promised Tuesday to keep the exchange rate \"basically stable,\" but Wednesday's decline prompted suggestions the yuan is likely to fall further. \n \n The yuan is likely to see \"continued strong influence\" from the central bank, with Tuesday's change \"probably marking the start of an engineered depreciation,\" said Mizuho Bank in a report. \n \n Many economists cautioned against seeing Beijing's move mainly as an effort to benefit its exporters. They note that China's currency, left to market forces alone, would have declined in value in recent months. \n \n The depreciation \"will not change the gloomy picture of global demand,\" said Vincent Chan of Credit Suisse in a report. \"The 2 percent devaluation cannot provide any meaningful help, but it caught the market by surprise.\" \n \n U.S. stocks tumbled Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 212 points. \n \n China becomes the third major trader to take actions that lower the value of its currency. Initiatives by Japan and the European Union over the past two years depressed the yen and euro by a wider margin than this week's decline in the yuan. \n \n The yuan, also known as the renminbi, is allowed to fluctuate in a band 2 percent above or below a rate set by the People's Bank of China based on its currency basket. \n \n The bank said that starting Tuesday, the daily target will be based on the yuan's closing the previous day and information from traders about supply and demand for the currency. \n \n The change presented a dilemma for China's trading partners, who have called repeatedly for Beijing to let market forces set its exchange rate but don't want to see the yuan weaken. \n \n It sparked complaints in Washington, where members of Congress have long complained Beijing manipulates its currency to gain a trade advantage. \n \n \"For years, China has rigged the rules and played games with its currency,\" said U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer. \"Rather than changing their ways, the Chinese government seems to be doubling down.\" \n \n The U.S. Treasury Department's response was more measured. \n \n \"China has indicated that the changes announced today are another step in its move to a more market-determined exchange rate,\" a department statement said. \n \n The International Monetary Fund said the change \"appears a welcome step\" to give market forces a bigger role. \n \n \"The exact impact will depend on how the new mechanism is implemented in practice,\" said an IMF statement. \"We believe that China can, and should, aim to achieve an effectively floating exchange rate system within two to three years.\" \n \n The IMF said the latest change would have no effect on the decision about whether to add the yuan to the dollar, the euro, the yen and the British pound in the basket of currencies used to set the value of the Fund's in-house currency, called Special Drawing Rights. The IMF staff recommended last week that China wait until at least October 2016 to join. The Fund's board is due to consider that recommendation in October. \n \n China's economic growth has slowed to an annual rate of just 7 percent, which is healthy for most countries but far below the previous decade's double-digit pace. \n \n The Federal Reserve is expected to boost the short-term interest rate it controls later this year. A rate hike would likely raise the value of the dollar, which has already jumped about 14 percent in value in the past 12 months against a basket of foreign currencies. \n \n The rising dollar has hurt U.S. exporters by making their goods costlier abroad, and China's devaluation could further complicate the Fed's decision on when to raise rates. By making Chinese goods comparatively cheaper in the United States, a weaker yuan would push already-low U.S. inflation even lower. \n \n The Fed wants to be \"reasonably confident\" that inflation is returning to its 2 percent target before raising rates. Inflation has risen just 1.3 percent in the past 12 months. \n \n Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, suggested the dollar's rise poses a concern for some Fed officials, known as doves, who have been reluctant to raise rates. Should the U.S. economy stumble in the coming weeks, \"dollar strength would only further embolden the doves at the next meeting\" in September, Feroli said. \n \n Still, Feroli said, \"we think this a minor stumbling block for a September\" rate increase. \n \n USB economist Tao Wang said Beijing would likely move cautiously, but investor expectations of further weakening \"could quickly become entrenched\" and cause the yuan to \"depreciate quite quickly and significantly.\" \n \n She said that would represent a \"sea change in China's exchange rate policy\" but would help to support flagging economic growth. \n \n ___ \n \n Rugaber contributed from Washington. AP Economics Writer Paul Wiseman in Washington and AP Writer Teresa Cerojano in Manila contributed to this report. ||||| SHANGHAI China's currency fell to a four-year low on Wednesday, slumping for a second day, after a central bank devaluation on Tuesday, and government sources believe the yuan may be allowed to slide even further to help the country's exporters. \n \n The yuan traded in China hit a low of 6.4510 per U.S. dollar, its lowest since August 2011, and the currency fared worse in international trade, touching 6.59 to the dollar. \n \n The currency has lost 3.5 percent against the U.S. dollar in China in the last two days, and around 4.8 percent in global markets after the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank, changed the way it calculates the reference rate around which the yuan is allowed to trade in a two percentage point band. \n \n The PBOC said it would now calculate the daily yuan fix, by taking more notice of market forces, including the closing price in the previous day's trading session. \n \n The devaluation sparked fears of a global \"currency war\" and accusations that Beijing was unfairly supporting its exporters, but the central bank on Wednesday sought to reassure financial markets that it was not embarking on a steady depreciation. \n \n \"Looking at the international and domestic economic situation, currently there is no basis for a sustained depreciation trend for the yuan,\" the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said. \n \n After the yuan slid further in early in Wednesday trade currency dealers said Chinese state-owned banks were seen selling dollars on behalf of the PBOC to restrain the yuan's fall, and the spot market rate recovered late in the day to close 6.3870, a rate which will influence Thursday's setting. \n \n \"Apparently, the central bank does not want the yuan to run out of control,\" said a trader at a European bank in Shanghai. \n \n However, sources involved in the Chinese policy-making process said powerful voices within government were pushing for the yuan to go still lower, suggesting pressure for an overall devaluation of almost 10 percent. \n \n Tuesday's yuan devaluation followed a run of poor economic data and resulted in the biggest one-day fall since 1994, raising market suspicions that China was embarking on a longer-term depreciation of its exchange rate that would make Chinese exports cheaper. \n \n Data on Chinese factory activity growth and retail sales on Wednesday underlined sluggish growth in the world's second-largest economy, while fiscal expenditures jumped 24.1 percent in July, reflecting Beijing's efforts to stimulate economic activity. \n \n China's Ministry of Commerce acknowledged on Wednesday that the depreciation would have a stimulative effect on exports, as some Chinese steel producers have already cut export prices in response to the lower yuan. \n \n Economic growth in China has slowed markedly this year and will hit a 25-year low even if it meets its official 7.0 percent target. Some economists believe China's economy is already growing only half as fast as official data shows, or even less. \n \n Analysts at BMI Finance Ltd in Hong Kong downgraded their year-end forecasts for the currency to 6.83, down 10 percent from pre-devaluation levels. \n \n The currency's slide puts other Asian economies at a disadvantage also and resulted in Indonesia's rupiah and Malaysia's ringgit hitting 17-year lows on Wednesday. The Australian and New Zealand dollars also fell to six-year lows. \n \n Indonesia's central bank pinned the rupiah's fall directly on the yuan devaluation and said it would step into the foreign exchange and bond markets to curb volatility. \n \n STOCKS FALL AGAIN AFTER YUAN SLIDE \n \n Stocks on major world markets fell again on Wednesday in the wake of the yuan devaluation as exporters to China feared a loss of competitiveness. \n \n An MSCI index of stocks on major world markets lost about 0.5 percent. Companies with notable exposure to China, including German automaker BMW and U.S. luxury goods maker Coach, lost 3.7 percent and 4.4 percent respectively. \n \n Investors sought safety in top-rated government bonds, driving yields on German two-year bonds to a record low and pushing U.S. Treasury yields down, with some analysts saying a long-awaited Federal Reserve interest rate rise may now be delayed. \n \n Trading in money markets showed investors are reducing expectations for a Fed interest rate increase in September due to concerns about global disinflation pressures resulting from China's moves. \n \n \"Volatility is picking up and it\u2019s causing turmoil, it\u2019s pushing bond yields lower and it\u2019s casting more doubt on the Fed,\" said Axel Merk, president and chief investment officer of Palo Alto, California-based Merk Investments. \n \n PLAYING TO THE IMF? \n \n The International Monetary Fund said China's move to make the yuan more responsive to market forces appeared to be a welcome step and that Beijing should aim for an effectively floating exchange rate within two to three years. \n \n Beijing has been lobbying the IMF to include the yuan in its basket of reserve currencies known as Special Drawing Rights, which it uses to lend to sovereign borrowers, which would enable more international use of the yuan. \n \n \"Greater exchange rate flexibility is important for China as it strives to give market forces a decisive role in the economy and is rapidly integrating into global financial markets,\" an IMF spokesperson said. \n \n William Dudley, head of the New York Federal Reserve, also said an adjustment to the yuan was probably appropriate if the Chinese economy was weaker than the authorities had expected. \n \n On a trade-weighted basis, China's yuan has been rising in recent years in part because of its peg to the U.S. dollar. The yuan has gained more than 14 percent over the last year when factoring in inflation, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements, making its exports less competitive. \n \n However, the devaluation was decried by U.S. lawmakers from both parties on Tuesday as a grab for an unfair export advantage and could set the stage for testy talks when Chinese President Xi Jinping visits Washington D.C. next month, given acrimony over issues ranging from cybersecurity to Beijing's territorial ambitions in the South China Sea. \n \n (This story has been refiled to correct paragraph one spelling of devaluation) \n \n (Additional reporting by Samuel Shen in SHANGHAI and Jason Subler in BEIJING; Writing by Will Waterman, Nigel Stephenson and David Gaffen; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Clive McKeef) ||||| Stocks, currencies and commodities fall sharply across region as investors fear a stalling China economy and possible currency war despite Beijing\u2019s assurances \n \n China stunned the world\u2019s financial markets on Wednesday by devaluing its currency for a second consecutive day, triggering fears its economy is in worse shape than investors believed. \n \n The move sent fresh shockwaves through global markets, pushing shares sharply lower and sending commodity prices further into reverse as traders feared the move could also ignite a currency war that would destabilise the world economy. \n \n There were widespread losses on stock exchanges in Asia, and in Europe markets suffered falls of about 1%, with the FTSE 100 in London tumbling almost 2% at one stage before settling at 6571, down 1.4%. \n \n The Chinese authorities have acted after a string of poor economic figures showed that previous efforts to boost exports and growth against the headwind of an overvalued currency had failed. \n \n A drop of 6.6% in car sales in July followed data at the weekend showing an 8% fall in exports and slowing business investment growth in the same month. A survey tracking China\u2019s factory output for July also missed expectations, coming in at 6% year-on-year growth instead of the 6.6% expected. \n \n One financial analyst said the devaluation, which pushed the yuan to a four-year low, heralded a tidal wave of cheap goods from Asia as other south east Asian countries followed suit. \n \n Albert Edwards, analyst at Societe Generale, said the yuan had become overvalued against the dollar in recent years and was unsustainably high relative to other major currencies. \n \n The Chinese currency hit a four-year low on Wednesday after the People\u2019s Bank of China set the yuan\u2019s daily midpoint even weaker than in Tuesday\u2019s devaluation. \n \n \n \n Market slide as China moves to weaken yuan again - live Read more \n \n Unlike the pound and other major currencies, the yuan\u2019s value is determined each day by the People\u2019s Bank based on movements the previous day. As part of the devaluation, the authorities said they would widen the criteria to include more market information, allowing the currency to rise or fall more rapidly than before. \n \n The central bank sought to reassure financial markets that it was not embarking on a steady depreciation. \n \n \u201cLooking at the international and domestic economic situation, currently there is no basis for a sustained depreciation trend for the yuan,\u201d it said. \n \n A spokesman said the downward movement of the currency was a result of a project to liberalise its management and not a deliberate attempt to drive down its value. \n \n But with the bank having said on Tuesday that that day\u2019s action was a \u201cone-off depreciation\u201d, the rapid two-day drop in the value of the currency of about 4% dealt a blow to investors. They fear a prolonged currency war that could damage world trade should the US and Japan retaliate and drive down the value of the dollar and yen. \n \n \n \n Oil prices remained below $50 a barrel, down from more than $110 a barrel last summer when the slowdown in China first became apparent. The prices of key industrial and construction metals \u2013 nickel, copper and aluminium \u2013 hit six-year lows. \n \n \n \n Rajeev De Mello, head of Asian fixed income at Schroders in Singapore, said: \u201cWhile it is too early to say whether this is the beginning of a sustained devaluation of the yuan, other central banks may be forced to follow suit and that may trigger a fresh round of currency weakening around the emerging world.\u201d \n \n Chinese yuan: everything depends on what happens next Read more \n \n The two devaluations come after a run of poor economic data and have raised suspicions that China is embarking on a longer-term slide in the exchange rate. \n \n A cheaper yuan will help Chinese exports by making them less expensive on overseas markets. \n \n The first move on Tuesday was the biggest one-day fall in the yuan since a massive devaluation in 1994. On Wednesday the yuan fell to 6.43 against the dollar, its weakest point since August 2011. The currency fared worse in offshore trade, touching 6.57. \n \n Why has China devalued its currency now and what impact will it have?

This would mark a major step in the international use of the Chinese currency. \n \n \u201cGreater exchange rate flexibility is important for China as it strives to give market forces a decisive role in the economy and is rapidly integrating into global financial markets,\u201d an IMF spokesperson said. ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n HONG KONG \u2014 As President Xi Jinping of China prepares for a state visit to Washington next month to smooth over troubled relations, his government has just turned the spotlight back on a recurring issue: the value of his country\u2019s currency. \n \n The currency, the renminbi, is part of the fabric of the global economy, providing a way for China to further its diplomatic and investment goals. The renminbi is also an important tool for the leadership\u2019s domestic agenda, namely supporting its economy. \n \n China now faces the difficult dilemma of trying to balance its needs at home and abroad. \n \n When China abruptly devalued its currency nearly 2 percent on Tuesday morning, authorities said market forces would play a bigger role in determining the value of the renminbi. After the renminbi fell further during trading on Tuesday, the central bank set the currency another 1.6 percent lower on Wednesday morning. \n \n The United States and others have long called for Beijing to let the currency move more freely, rather than keeping it under such tight control. China\u2019s restrictions on the renminbi have also been a concern of the International Monetary Fund, which is weighing whether to include the renminbi in an elite group of world currencies along with the dollar, the euro and the yen. \n \n But China has another, seemingly contradictory, motive. In devaluing its currency, China is giving priority to its domestic needs. As China\u2019s economy slows, a weaker currency will help buoy the country\u2019s exporters and create jobs at home. \n \n Surging blue-collar wages in China coupled with recent declines in the currencies of rival exporters like South Korea and Taiwan have made it harder for Chinese companies to compete in labor-intensive industries like garment manufacturing and shoe production. Chinese exports fell 8 percent last month compared with a year ago. \n \n \u201cWhen the renminbi was appreciating, our customers, who are mainly from North America and Europe, had complained about our prices being too high,\u201d said Anna Cho, sales manager of the Shanghai Kaiyuan Pump Industrial Company, a maker of water and sewage pumps. \u201cThey will be happy about this new development,\u201d she said, referring to the currency devaluation. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The coming months will provide a test of whether the leadership is focused more on reforms or on the nation\u2019s economy. While Beijing wants a weak currency, it does not want it to go too low. \n \n On Tuesday, traders bet heavily that the renminbi would continue to fall. If Beijing follows through on its pledge to let the market play a much bigger role, more declines will follow. \n \n \u201cIf they really do it, it may be going down and down and down,\u201d said Diana Choyleva, the chief economist at Lombard Street Research, a consulting firm in London. \n \n Devaluing the renminbi weeks before President Xi\u2019s visit to the United States also poses clear political challenges at a time when China is trying to smooth over trans-Pacific disputes. \n \n In recent weeks, China announced a halt to its controversial construction of artificial islands in the South China Sea. It has also had an uncommonly muted response to American accusations of digital espionage. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The devaluation risks inflaming a seemingly dormant political issue in the United States: whether China manipulates its currency to gain a trade advantage. Critics in Congress have long argued that the renminbi is undervalued and that this dynamic has prompted many companies to move production to China. \n \n \u201cFor years, China has rigged the rules and played games with its currency, leaving American workers out to dry. Rather than changing their ways, the Chinese government seems to be doubling down,\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. \n \n Under President George W. Bush and now under President Obama, the Treasury has been cautious about publicly criticizing China on currency policy. Treasury officials have not wanted to incite Chinese defiance, and they have tended to respect China\u2019s contention that its trade surpluses, though huge, have shrunk as a percentage of its growing economy. \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cWe will continue to monitor how these changes are implemented and continue to press China on the pace of its reforms, including additional measures to transition to a market-oriented exchange rate and its stated desire to move towards an economy that is more dependent on domestic demand, which is in China and America\u2019s best interests,\u201d a Treasury representative said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cAny reversal in reforms would be a troubling development.\u201d \n \n China\u2019s action could also factor into the Federal Reserve\u2019s thinking. \n \n The Fed\u2019s leaders have been talking for months about raising interest rates as a way to curb the considerable monetary stimulus they have delivered to the strengthening American economy. But a weakened renminbi \u2014 and the possibility that other countries may follow suit \u2014 could mean further weakening of American exports and slower economic growth. \n \n \u201cIt could lower the odds of a Fed rate hike in the near term,\u201d said Thomas Lam, the chief economist for industrialized economies at RHB Securities Singapore, a unit of a Malaysian financial conglomerate, the RHB Group. \n \n The currency situation puts China in a tricky position. \n \n China has the means to stop any unwanted drop in currency. The country has $3.5 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, which it can use to buy back renminbi globally and push up the value. \n \n But the devaluation also comes at a time when China is pushing for broader acceptance of the renminbi, and the exercise of tight currency controls undermines that effort. \n \n The International Monetary Fund contended for years that the renminbi was undervalued, but it dropped that assertion in May. Still, the I.M.F. in a staff report last week suggested that China would need more time to finish preparations for including the renminbi as a global reserve currency. \n \n The I.M.F., in particular, wants to see more evidence that the renminbi is being used outside China, notably for central bank reserves or bonds. The appetite among overseas central banks and bond investors for renminbi-denominated assets has gradually increased. \n \n But part of the demand has been a speculative bet that the renminbi will continue to rise against the dollar. Even small, occasional hints in the last 18 months that the renminbi might weaken have tended to erode such players\u2019 enthusiasm. So Tuesday\u2019s devaluation could damage China\u2019s bid to bolster international use of its currency. \n \n The I.M.F. on Tuesday said that China\u2019s new plan for determining the value of the renminbi \u201cappears a welcome step as it should allow market forces to have a greater role.\u201d But \u201cthe exact impact will depend on how the new mechanism is implemented in practice.\u201d \n \n Senator Schumer warned that the devaluation might lower the chances that the renminbi will be recognized by the I.M.F. as a leading currency, as part of the fund\u2019s so-called special drawing rights. \n \n \u201cUnless and until China stops artificially devaluing their currency,\u201d he said, \u201cthe renminbi should be barred from consideration as a global reserve currency by the I.M.F.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 In a move that some analysts fear could be the start of a \"global currency war,\" China's yuan dropped again today, dragging other Asian currencies down with it. Today's drop against the dollar was the second biggest since 1994, exceeded only by yesterday's, and the rapid fall has led some to believe that the country is trying to boost exports and create jobs at the expense of rivals like South Korea, Reuters notes. It's not clear how long the drop will continue: China has described the devaluation as a \"one-off,\" and the New York Times notes that with $3.5 trillion in foreign currency reserves, China certainly has the ability to prevent any unwanted falls in the yuan. A change in the tightly controlled exchange-rate mechanism means the yuan could continue to drop 2% a day, the AP reports. The IMF has welcomed the move as a way to give market forces more control of a currency that China wants to play a bigger role globally, but US lawmakers are skeptical. \"For years, China has rigged the rules and played games with its currency,\" says Sen.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 China's currency fell further today following a surprise change in its exchange rate mechanism that rattled global markets and threatens to fan trade tensions with the United States and Europe. On Wednesday, the yuan dropped another1.6%. In theory, it could drop 2% every day given it can trade 2% around a rate that is set based on the previous day's closing value, reports the AP. Until now, China has set the yuan's value each day based on a basket of currencies that is believed to be dominated by the US dollar. That meant the yuan rose as the dollar jumped over the past year, hurting its exporters and raising the threat of politically dangerous job losses. Exports in July plummeted by an unexpectedly steep 8.3% from a year earlier. The People's Bank of China promised Tuesday to keep the exchange rate \"basically stable,\" but today's decline prompted suggestions the yuan is likely to fall further. The yuan is likely to see \"continued strong influence\" from the central bank, with Tuesday's change \"probably marking the start of an engineered depreciation,\" said Mizuho Bank in a report. Many economists cautioned against seeing Beijing's move mainly as an effort to benefit its exporters. The depreciation \"will not change the gloomy picture of global demand,\" said Vincent Chan of Credit Suisse in a report. \"The 2% devaluation cannot provide any meaningful help, but it caught the market by surprise.\" China becomes the third major trader to take actions that lower the value of its currency.",

    "document": "WASHINGTON \u2013- In an interview with The Huffington Post, Sen. Rand Paul stoutly defended an aide who, as a radio shock jock in South Carolina, praised John Wilkes Booth, heaped scorn on Abraham Lincoln and wore a ski mask emblazoned with the stars and bars of the Confederate Battle Flag. \n \n Paul (R-Ky.) stressed that he opposed such views, many of which have been recanted by the Senate aide, Jack Hunter, who co-wrote Paul's first book in 2010 and who is now his social media adviser in Washington. \n \n \u201cI'm not a fan of secession,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think the things he said about John Wilkes Booth are absolutely stupid. I think Lincoln was one of our greatest presidents. Do I think Lincoln was wrong is taking away the freedom of the press and the right of habeas corpus? Yeah. \n \n \u201cThere were great people who were for emancipation. Lincoln came to his greatness. One Republican congressman described it as \u2018on borrowed plumage.\u2019 I love the description, because there were some great fighters [for emancipation] and Lincoln had to be pushed. But I'm not an enemy of Lincoln, like some who think he was an awful person.\u201d \n \n Paul said that Hunter had never acted in a discriminatory way, and that his earlier work in South Carolina was a form of youthful political showmanship. \n \n \u201cPeople are calling him a white supremacist,\u201d Paul told me in his Senate office. \u201cIf I thought he was a white supremacist, he would be fired immediately. If I thought he would treat anybody on the color of their skin different than others, I\u2019d fire him immediately. \n \n \u201cAll I can say is, we have a zero tolerance policy for anybody who displays discriminatory behavior or belief in discriminating against people based on the color of their skin, their religion, their sexual orientation, anything like that,\u201d Paul told me. \u201cWe won't tolerate any of that, and I've seen no evidence of that. \n \n \u201cAre we at a point where nobody can have had a youth or said anything untoward?\u201d the senator asked rhetorically. \n \n Hunter is 39 years old. He was a well-known figure in South Carolina for years before he caught Paul\u2019s eye with some well-circulated YouTube videos. \n \n Say this about Paul: He doesn\u2019t run from a fight, especially if it means defying a Washington Beltway consensus. \n \n The 50-year-old freshman senator, a tea party libertarian hungering to climb his way through the GOP to the White House, wins passionate fans for questioning the rise of the Security State at home and the drone wars abroad. \n \n But he wins equally passionate critics for some of his statements on race and civil rights, which foes see as a throwback to the days when resistance to federal power was tantamount to defending the Old South. \n \n The consistent thread is his irritation at other people -\u2013 especially those in the federal government or media \u2013- telling him what he should do, say or think. \n \n And he is not about to distance himself from a writer who long called himself the \u201cSouthern Avenger.\u201d \n \n Paul insisted that he had only known \u201cvaguely\u201d about Hunter\u2019s work. But even if he had known all of the details, Paul said, he would not have shied away from hiring Hunter because he is a talented conservative writer. \n \n \u201cLet me put it this way,\u201d Paul said. \u201dI\u2019m aware of some of your columns, but not all of them. And some of them I find very unfair, calling me a conspiracy nut, things like that. But I chose to talk to you today. So that means we have a relationship now. But it doesn't mean that I agree with all of your past writings. \n \n \u201cIt's the same way any time you meet somebody who's got a large body of work,\u201d Paul continued. \"So if I hired you to work in my campaign, there would be some things I agreed with, and some things I disagreed with. \n \n \u201cI think it's hard. The thing is, I grapple with this. What am I supposed to do? I'm going to have a lot of people working for me. They've all got writings and opinions.\" \n \n Hunter, he said, \"is incredibly talented.\" \n \n Behind the flashy and provocative rhetoric, Paul said, Hunter often made thought-provoking arguments. \u201cLook and listen to the actual words and not to the headlines, people,\u201d Paul told me. \n \n What about the ski mask? I asked. \n \n \u201cIt was a shock radio job. He was doing wet T-shirt contests. But can a guy not have a youth and stuff? People try to say I smoked pot one time, and I wasn't fit for office.\u201d \n \n Paul clearly thinks that he is. \n \n And, by the way, he told me, he was headed to Nevada this weekend -- Nevada being a key early-nominating state in what would be a 2016 GOP nominating race. \n \n Before he gets there, Paul will have to deal with myriad nettlesome issues that come from his family\u2019s political roots in the libertarian, states\u2019 rights and nativist soil deep in some reaches of American politics. \n \n A major theme of Paul\u2019s short career has been the tension between the grassroots tea party enthusiasm and libertarian online donors he inherits from his father -\u2013 perennial presidential candidate and former Texas Rep. Ron Paul -\u2013 and Rand\u2019s own strategic plan to be seen as a mainstream-able GOP figure. \n \n The two imperatives seemed to have collided in the person of Jack Hunter this week, and Paul stood by his friend. He could hardly do otherwise. Hunter is too close to him, for one, to be easily jettisoned. But more important for Paul, firing him would have been allowing other people to tell him what to do. ||||| The man who for years called himself the \u201cSouthern Avenger\u201d says he now seeks to avenge his own honor. \n \n Jack Hunter, the aide to Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul who has been under fire for comments critical of Abraham Lincoln and sympathetic to the Confederacy, has left the senator\u2019s office to resume his career as a political pundit. \n \n Hunter told The Daily Caller News Foundation that he wanted to avoid being a distraction for Paul and to clear his own name, which he argues is now unfairly associated with racism. \n \n A senior Paul aide confirmed Hunter\u2019s departure. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve long been a conservative, and years ago, a much more politically incorrect (and campy) one,\u201d Hunter said in an email. \u201cBut there\u2019s a significant difference between being politically incorrect and racist. I\u2019ve also become far more libertarian over the years, a philosophy that encourages a more tolerant worldview, through the lens of which I now look back on some of my older comments with embarrassment.\u201d \n \n Hunter, who has contributed opinion pieces to The Daily Caller, is a personal friend of the author. \n \n The Washington Free Beacon originally reported that Hunter toasted the birthday of Lincoln assassin John Wilkes Booth, lamented the United States\u2019 shrinking white majority and compared honoring the Founding Fathers while admiring Lincoln to \u201cpraising Jesus and worshiping Satan simultaneously.\u201d \n \n The story set off a firestorm of controversy across the political spectrum. Hunter was most recently criticized by his former editor at the Charleston City Paper for asking him to remove posts and for being the \u201cmost common kind of racist, the one that doesn\u2019t realize that he is one.\u201d \n \n Chris Haire, the Charleston alt-weekly\u2019s managing editor, also described Newt Gingrich, Rush Limbaugh, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Pat Buchanan as racists. Asked why he published Hunter \u2014 a paid columnist \u2014 if he believed him to be a racist, Haire tweeted in response, \u201cTo reveal the mindset of the SCGOP and the Neoconfederate fringe.\u201d \n \n Paul described Hunter\u2019s comments as \u201cabsolutely stupid\u201d but defended his \u201cincredibly talented\u201d social media director in an interview with The Huffington Post. \n \n \u201cPeople are calling him a white supremacist,\u201d Paul said. \u201cIf I thought he was a white supremacist, he would be fired immediately.\u201d \n \n Others have defended Hunter as well, saying that while he may have been attracted to peculiarly Southern forms of conservatism and occasionally naive about racial issues, he is not the figure some critics have portrayed. \n \n \u201cIn all my dealings with Jack Hunter, I have found him to be most impressive, most professional and a committed conservative,\u201d South Carolina Republican Rep. Mark Sanford told TheDCNF. \u201cI think a lot of this has less to do with Jack Hunter than Rand Paul and 2016.\u201d \n \n \n \n Former Charleston City Paper music editor Ballard Lesemann knew Hunter back when he was still wearing a pro-wrestling-style mask emblazoned with the Confederate flag. He told TheDCNF that Hunter was already assuming a less kitschy and provocative persona back then. \n \n \u201cBy the time Jack started working with local AM news/talk station 1250 WTMA, he\u2019d already ditched the mask and the schtick side of the Southern Avenger character, and he began to develop a more serious, thoughtful, in-depth approach and delivery,\u201d Lesemann said. \n \n While the two of them \u201cbonded more over conversations about Iron Maiden, Rush, and the Who than about political candidates and partisan politics,\u201d Lesemann was familiar with Hunter\u2019s political work. \n \n \u201cAs a left-leaning independent who voted for Ralph Nader in 2000, 2004 and 2008, you can imagine how my own political views could clash with those of Jack Hunter\u2019s,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in all of our conversations, interviews, and late-night tavern chats, we never fought or argued.\u201d \n \n Marcus Amaker edited Hunter\u2019s entertainment writings for the Charleston Post and Courier. He described Hunter as \u201ca good guy\u201d and \u201cprofessional freelancer.\u201d \n \n \u201cI never had any issues with Jack,\u201d Amaker told TheDCNF. \u201cHonestly, I haven\u2019t paid much attention to the controversy. Anything that seeks to divide people isn\u2019t on my radar and doesn\u2019t get my energy.\u201d \n \n Prior to working for Rand Paul, Hunter was the official campaign blogger for Ron Paul during the 2012 GOP primaries. In that capacity, he frequently worked to marginalize extremists within the movement, ridiculing conspiracy theorists and defending the idea of working within the mainstream Republican Party. \n \n Now the controversy over Hunter\u2019s past writings and radio broadcasts is widely seen as a drag on libertarian-leaning Republicans\u2019 mainstream political ambitions and a reminder of the elder Paul\u2019s newsletters. \n \n While the former Texas congressman denied writing or even reading the racist content in the newsletters that appeared under his name, questions persisted about their authorship. \n \n Hunter isn\u2019t denying writing the columns in question, but he does say the coverage doesn\u2019t represent the full body of his writing. \n \n \u201cThe stories made me angry, as well as many who\u2019ve followed my work, because the cherry-picked distortions weren\u2019t even remotely the real me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was enraging to watch neoconservatives, liberals and even some actual racists speculate about what I believe, based on what they were eager to portray me as believing. Not surprisingly, their speculations almost always suited their own political purposes.\u201d \n \n \u201cStill, the moment I became a distraction for Sen. Paul, I knew it was time to leave. My purpose has always been to help, not hinder,\u201d Hunter added. Now as he once ditched the mask, he will also discard the Southern Avenger name. \n \n \u201cI also wanted the ability to defend myself in my own voice, not as a member of anyone\u2019s staff or even as the \u2018Southern Avenger\u2019 character, which has now been so mischaracterized that I will permanently retire that moniker,\u201d Hunter said. \n \n In addition to any fallout for Rand Paul\u2019s political future, the controversy raises philosophical questions for conservatives and libertarians. \n \n \u201cNothing in American history has done more harm to the limited government cause than the association of state sovereignty arguments with defenses of slavery,\u201d wrote Philip Klein in the Washington Examiner. \u201cConfederates who employed limited government arguments to argue for preserving a brutal and inhumane practice shouldn\u2019t be deemed friends of limited government.\u201d \n \n Hunter maintains he is now freer to join these debates. \n \n \u201cI look forward to returning to just being a pundit and fighting these battles on my own,\u201d he said. \u201cThe neoconservatives, who first ran and promoted this story, would much rather argue about the Civil War than the Iraq War.\u201d \n \n \u201cFrom their standpoint, and given current trends within the Republican Party,\u201d Hunter concluded, \u201cI can\u2019t say I blame them.\u201d \n \n Follow Jim on Twitter \n \n Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

James Antle III at the Daily Caller. \"I've long been a conservative, and years ago, a much more politically incorrect (and campy) one,\" Hunter said. \"But there's a significant difference between being politically incorrect and racist.\" He intends to return to punditry. Paul had previously stuck by Hunter. \"I think the things he said about John Wilkes Booth are absolutely stupid,\" he told the Huffington Post two weeks ago. But \"if I thought he was a white supremacist, he would be fired immediately.\" Instead it seems he's been fired slowly. Paul today said he and Hunter had come to a \"mutual decision\" that he should leave. \"I think everybody occasionally has people that work for them who sometimes have a background that damages what you\u2019re trying to do,\" Paul explained, according to CN|2.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Rand Paul tells the Huffington Post that he's \"not a fan of secession\" and that \"the things he said about John Wilkes Booth are absolutely stupid. I think Lincoln was one of our greatest presidents. Do I think Lincoln was wrong is taking away the freedom of the press and the right of habeas corpus? Yeah. There were great people who were for emancipation. Lincoln came to his greatness. One Republican congressman described it as 'on borrowed plumage.' I love the description, because there were some great fighters [for emancipation] and Lincoln had to be pushed. But I'm not an enemy of Lincoln, like some who think he was an awful person.\" Paul says he's aware of some of Jack Hunter's past writings, but \"it doesn't mean that I agree with all of your past writings. It's the same way any time you meet somebody who's got a large body of work. So if I hired you to work in my campaign, there would be some things I agreed with, and some things I disagreed with. I think it's hard. The thing is, I grapple with this. What am I supposed to do? I'm going to have a lot of people working for me. They've all got writings and opinions.\"",

    "document": "Courtesy of Paramount Pictures. \n \n Well, they\u2019ve finally arrived. After months and months of speculation, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced its Academy Award nominations this morning, honoring the supposedly best of 2014 in film. And in large part, they did do just that. The marvelous Boyhood got lots of recognition, for its writing, acting, and directing. Laura Dern, beloved by an obsessive subset of the nation, got a nomination\u2014for Wild, but frankly it doesn\u2019t matter what it was for, it\u2019s good news no matter what. Other thoughtful performances, like Edward Norton in Birdman and Mark Ruffalo in Foxcatcher, were also nominated. So there\u2019s much to be happy about. And yet, don\u2019t the nominations this year feel so wrong? \n \n Let\u2019s start with the silly stuff. After she snagged Golden Globe and SAG nominations, we in the Oscar-predicting business thought that Jennifer Aniston was for sure going to get nominated for Cake. Not because it was such a groundbreaking performance, but because it seemed like one of the big narratives of the year, a much-maligned-and-gossiped-about comedy star getting the big, unexpected dramatic accolade. But, it didn\u2019t happen. And, really, I have only myself to blame for being shocked. The overhype and subsequent anticlimax of Aniston\u2019s truncated Oscar season was all the doing of people like me. Because the actress who \u201cstole\u201d Aniston\u2019s spot, Marion Cotillard, won some big critics prizes for her performance in Two Days, One Night (and in The Immigrant, which this nomination seems to also essentially be recognizing). So there was no reason to count her out of the Oscars. But, Aniston was the much more exciting story, and so we, I, ran with it. And that was silly of us. Apologies for that. \n \n On the more egregious end of things, that the superb Swedish film Force Majeure was not nominated for best foreign language feature is a modest outrage, displaying the sort of frustrating shortsightedness that the Academy is unfortunately rather famous for. Force Majeure is a difficult film, and hard to classify, not neatly comedy or drama or satire or tragedy or anything else. Yes, I suppose you could say the same for Birdman, which did very well this morning, but that movie has a certain palatable polish to it that Force Majeure, with all its angular foreignness, does not. And so it got ignored. One of the absolute best movies of the year! Completely snubbed. That\u2019s annoying. \n \n But not nearly as annoying, if annoying is even the right word, as what happened with two other big films this morning. First, Selma was nominated for only two awards, for best original song and best picture. That best-picture nod is very good news, of course. But that the movie\u2019s wonderful acting, directing, writing, editing, and cinematography were shut out is a real oversight, sad in the story it tells and troubling in how grimly predictable it was. Maybe the issue really was, as some are saying, Paramount botching the movie\u2019s awards campaign, failing to get screeners out in time. But there\u2019s a strong whiff of something else amiss here, when a movie so beloved by audiences and critics, that has so many strong points that could be singled out for awards recognition, goes largely unrecognized. Especially in a year when other, far less acute or thoughtful biopics about white people fared so much better. \n \n Selma\u2019s short-shrifting is particularly galling when you consider that American Sniper got more nominations, two of them in \u201cmajor\u201d categories (best actor and editing). Clint Eastwood\u2019s messily reverent biopic of Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle does exactly the opposite of what Selma does, occluding important sociopolitical truths behind a veil of macho patriotism. It\u2019s not exactly a surprise that older Academy members are enamored of its aggressive jingoism. But when that fusty predilection makes collateral damage of a movie like Selma\u2014such a searching, galvanizing, genuinely enriching film, perfectly tuned for such troubled political and social times\u2014the crusty old Academy begins to look, as it does from time to time, like a deeply flawed voting body. \n \n Gallery: The 2015 Acting Oscar Nominees ||||| No black woman has ever been nominated for a Best Director Oscar. That won't be changing this year. \n \n Despite its hype, previous awards nominations and breathless reviews, Selma director Ava DuVernay was not nominated for a Best Director Oscar in 2015. Who was? Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu (Birdman), Richard Linklater (Boyhood), Bennett Miller (Foxcatcher), Wes Anderson (The Grand Budapest Hotel) and Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game). In other words, guys getting nominated for movies about white guys. \n \n For those left scratching their heads, here are some further things to ponder. David Oyelowo, who earned rave reviews for his portrayal of Martin Luther King, Jr. in Selma was not nominated for a Best Actor Oscar. He was beat out by Steve Carell, Bradley Cooper (who wasn't even nominated for Golden Globe), Benedict Cumberbatch, Michael Keaton and Eddie Redmayne. Five white men. \n \n See also: 7 black female directors earning incredible Hollywood reviews \n \n Though Selma was nominated for Best Picture, an inevitability thanks to the category allowing five to 10 nominations, it wasn't nominated for best screenplay. The lack of nominations doesn't bode well for a Best Picture win \u2014 the only film in history to take home the top prize without a director or acting nomination was the 1932 film Grand Hotel. \n \n Though Selma could possibly make history in that respect, it's doubtful. The Academy already missed its chance once. \n \n The surprising dearth of nominations for minorities \u2014 this will be the whitest group since 1998 \u2014 comes after a banner year in 2014 for black actors and directors. The Steve McQueen-directed 12 Years a Slave took home three awards, for Best Supporting Actress (Lupita Nyong'o), Best Adapted Screenplay (John Ridley) and Best Picture. Furthermore, lead actor Chiwetel Ejiofor was at least nominated for Best Actor. \n \n Lupita Nyong'o holding her Oscar at the 2014 Academy Awards. Image: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP/Associated Press \n \n Historically, black directors don't fare well at the Oscars. Only three black men have ever been nominated in the best director category: John Singleton for Boyz n the Hood (1991), Lee Daniels for Precious (2009) and Steve McQueen for 12 Years a Slave just last year. None of them won. No black person has ever won a Best Director Oscar. \n \n This year marks the Academy's 87th award show. Is it really believable that in 87 shows, not one black person has been deserving of a Best Director win? Of course not. \n \n To be fair, it's not as though black people were able to direct award-worthy films back in 1929, when the first Academy Awards took place. What with all the rampant racism in the country at the time, it wasn't easy for black people to break into Hollywood. However, that's inexcusable in today's film landscape. There's a wealth of award-worthy black directors whose work is deserving of recognition. \n \n Nominating DuVernay could have been an incredible, two-fold win on its own. Though she should not be nominated just for the sake of it, it's fair to say DuVernay has earned her place. She directed one of the most talked-about films of the year and has been nominated at every turn \u2014 except where it counts. She would have also only been the fifth woman in history to grab a Best Director nom (only one has won \u2014 Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 for Hurt Locker). \n \n Last year, 43.1 million people watched the Oscars. What will all those people see this year? An awards ceremony that shunned one of its brightest new stars. \n \n Ava DuVernay at the 2015 Golden Globes, where she was nominated for Best Director. Image: ordan Strauss/Invision/AP/Associated Press \n \n This year's nominations send a brutal message: Academy voters do not appear to care about diversity. This year's nominations refuse to highlight actors and directors who deliver excellent work in an industry that repeatedly shuts them out. Voting members of the Academy are 93% white, and 76% male, according to the Los Angeles Times. \n \n What's worse is this comes at a time when Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the Academy's president (who is a black woman) has been openly pushing for more diversity. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re in the second decade of the 21st century, and it\u2019s a whole new environment for entertainment,\u201d Boone Isaacs told Variety. \u201cI think part of this is a recognition that there are different voices that need to be heard \u2014 and that there are audiences for these different voices. We at the Academy want to be a place where these voices can be recognized.\u201d \n \n Despite Boone Isaacs' best efforts, those voices aren't going to be recognized this year. And that's a damn shame. ||||| The Oscar nominations were announced this morning. There will be plenty of analysis regarding good surprises and bad surprises, and I may dip my toes in later today. But the most egregious omission is the sadly not-entirely-surprising absence of Selma\u2019s Ava DuVernay from the five contenders nominated for Best Director. This is not a place to complain about the five nominees who did make the cut, although anyone who knows me well enough knows which one or ones I could have swapped in and out. To the extent that one can be \u201cangry\u201d about a certain filmmaker not being nominated for a major award that honors the best in filmmaking, I am angry. I am angry because she deserved a nomination. I am angry because if the legacy of DuVernay\u2019s Selma becomes shaped by its Oscar-season controversy, I fear that it will affect the artistic opportunities afforded to its African-American female director in a manner different than if Selma would have come under fire under the directorial lens of a white male filmmaker. \n \n Ms. DuVernay directed one of the very best films of the year and has been lauded and celebrated accordingly for the last two months and yet she was shoved aside for at least a few contenders who were nowhere near as celebrated. There is a real chance that this terrific and towering achievement that highlights the profoundly heroic and blood-stained work of those who worked with and for Martin Luther King Jr. in the civil rights movement will be forever defined by the notion that it wasn't nice enough to a powerful white guy in a supporting role. Kathryn Bigelow\u2019s Zero Dark Thirty allowed itself to be defined by those sniping from the sidelines (including many outside the filmmaking and critical community) that the film somehow endorsed and glamorized torture because it didn't have characters monologue at length about the immorality and impracticality of torture. Despite the film\u2019s rave reviews and rock-solid box office ($132 million on a $40m budget), the narrative around Bigelow\u2019s masterpiece, for which she too was denied a Best Director nomination, has become \u201cthat torture movie.\u201d Zero Dark Thirty, an overwhelming indictment of our entire post-9/11 mindset wrapped up in the story of one of the War on Terror\u2019s alleged successes, was tainted along with its female filmmaker, who currently has no projects on tap. \n \n Selma is not the first \u201cbased on a true story\u201d picture that has come under fire for historical inaccuracies. But it is the rare black-centric historical drama told explicitly from the point of view of its black protagonists. So it is both ironic and infuriating that it has now been defamed because of the (I would argue false) notion that it isn't nice enough to a really powerful white guy who plays a key supporting role. More importantly, it is a rare big movie, even if it was merely a $20 million independently financed production, which comes from the lens of a female African-American filmmaker. We are just now getting to a point where Warner Bros./ Time Warner Inc. felt properly pressured (or logically inclined) to hire a female director to direct a Wonder Woman movie. We are just at the point where we have male black filmmakers like Lee Daniels and Steve McQueen crafting very important movies about black characters and/or black-centric historical events. We've even got Tim Story crafting franchises for Kevin Hart and Ice Cube. It\u2019s a very tiny piece of progress, but it is thus-far male-centric in nature. \n \n I have no idea what offers (if any) have been afforded to Ms. DuVernay in the aftermath of Selma\u2019s initial rave reviews and Oscar-happy media tour. But she is, to put it bluntly, by virtue of her race and her gender, at a greater disadvantage in terms of what opportunities are afforded to her in a still explicitly white/male-centric Hollywood. Mortem Tydlum will face no penalty for the borderline libelous (but unquestionably entertaining and engaging) The Imitation Game when it comes time for him to pick his next project. Clint Eastwood may have sanded off the rough edges off of American Sniper\u2019s protagonist, but he will still get to do what he wants to do next time out. Bennett Miller will face no qualms getting a directing job despite the various \"we're pretending our protagonists are secretly gay for drama\" fabrications in Sony's Foxcatcher. James Marsh will face no career hurdles on account of the not-100% accurate The Theory of Everything. And they arguably shouldn't face any real penalties, since historical movies are at best an approximation of history, a kind of \"Elseworlds\" variation on known events. The films will earn their critical plaudits, make their money, and win their awards, but the respective directors have already won. \n \n WATCH: Common Talks About Working On 'Selma' \n \n But Ms. DuVernay used Paramount's ( Viacom Inc.) Selma as both a personal artistic statement and a calling card of sorts in terms of what she can do behind a camera in an industry that is mostly filled with white male directors. White male filmmakers have the luxury of being mediocre, and would-be Oscar bait films about interesting white males have the luxury of shrugging off the failures accrued during Oscar season and coasting merely on the perception of prestige whether the films are worthy or not. Damien Chazelle and Dan Gilroy will get huge career boosts merely because Whiplash and Nightcrawler were two of the best movies of the year, and Oscar validation would merely have been a cherry on top. Ms. DuVernay, more than her peers, arguably needed that Oscar validation as a bargaining chip. \n \n That Ms. DuVernay didn't get a Best Director Oscar nomination doesn't make Selma any less of a great film. But that she was not among the final five announced this morning points to the notion that the smear campaign worked as intended. It\u2019s a sad reflection of a year when a number of good, great, and lousy fictionalized true-life biopics about allegedly great or somewhat interesting white men are well-represented while one of the very best-reviewed movies of the year went with hardly a single relevant nomination, aside from getting into the expanded Best Picture field, arguably on account of controversy over its accuracy. Considering the obstacles that Ms. DuVernay faces in terms of just steady employment by virtue of her gender and skin color, the risk of Selma being defined not by its once-unquestionable quality as a motion picture but rather by the context of its back-and-forth bantering over its alleged historical embellishments is more than just trivial. \n \n I\u2019m angry because one of the best films of the year has been libeled and that said libel apparently worked. I hope I\u2019m wrong about both Selma\u2019s cinematic legacy and about DuVernay\u2019s career prospects. Maybe she will get a call from Marvel tomorrow to helm a Phase Three picture as Luke Y. Thompson brilliantly advocated on Monday. Maybe she will quickly make a deal to do whatever it is she wants to do with little fuss and little melodrama merely based on the obvious filmmaking talent than Selma displays. But her omission from the five Best Director candidates this year makes that possibility that much less likely in a way that it wouldn\u2019t have for a Selma directed by (for example) Paul Greengrass. Greengrass, who originally intended to direct Memphis based on an earlier portion of King's life, would have emerged unscathed. I can only hope Ava DuVernay does. And that\u2019s why it matters. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m angry. \n \n Also on Forbes:",

Regional Office for Central Africa, told the Security Council on Monday that an African-led military campaign and defections by rebels have weakened the L.R.A.

    "document": "By Timothy Large LONDON, Oct 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Some 30 million people are enslaved worldwide, trafficked into brothels, forced into manual labour, victims of debt bondage or even born into servitude, a global index on modern slavery showed on Thursday. Almost half are in India, where slavery ranges from bonded labour in quarries and kilns to commercial sex exploitation, although the scourge exists in all 162 countries surveyed by Walk Free, an Australian-based rights group. Its estimate of 29.8 million slaves worldwide is higher than other attempts to quantify modern slavery. The International Labour Organisation estimates that almost 21 million people are victims of forced labour. \"Today some people are still being born into hereditary slavery, a staggering but harsh reality, particularly in parts of West Africa and South Asia,\" the report said. \"Other victims are captured or kidnapped before being sold or kept for exploitation, whether through 'marriage', unpaid labour on fishing boats, or as domestic workers. Others are tricked and lured into situations they cannot escape, with false promises of a good job or an education.\" The Global Slavery Index 2013 defines slavery as the possession or control of people to deny freedom and exploit them for profit or sex, usually through violence, coercion or deception. The definition includes indentured servitude, forced marriage and the abduction of children to serve in wars. According to the index, 10 countries alone account for three quarters of the world's slaves. After India, China has the most with 2.9 million, followed by Pakistan (2.1 million), Nigeria (701,000), Ethiopia (651,000), Russia (516,000), Thailand (473,000), Democratic Republic of Congo (462,000), Myanmar (384,000) and Bangladesh (343,000). The index also ranks nations by prevalence of slavery per head of population. By this measure, Mauritania is worst, with almost 4 percent of its 3.8 million people enslaved. Estimates by other organisations put the level at up to 20 percent. Chattel slavery is common in Mauritania, meaning that slave status is passed down through generations. \"Owners\" buy, sell, rent out or give away their slaves as gifts. After Mauritania, slavery is most prevalent by population in Haiti, where a system of child labour known as \"restavek\" encourages poor families to send their children to wealthier acquaintances, where many end up exploited and abused. Pakistan, India, Nepal, Moldova, Benin, Ivory Coast, Gambia and Gabon have the next highest prevalence rates. At the other end of the scale, Iceland has the lowest estimated prevalence with fewer than 100 slaves. Next best are Ireland, Britain, New Zealand, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Luxembourg, Finland and Denmark, although researchers said slave numbers in such wealthy countries were higher than previously thought. \"They've been allocating resources against this crime according to the tiny handful of cases that they've been aware of,\" said Kevin Bales, lead researcher and a professor at the Wilberforce Institute for the Study of Slavery and Emancipation at Hull University. \"Our estimates are telling them that the numbers of people in slavery - whether it's in Great Britain or Finland or wherever - in these richer countries actually tends to be about six to 10 times higher than they think it is.\" Walk Free CEO Nick Grono said the annual index would serve as an important baseline for governments and activists in the anti-slavery fight. \"This kind of data hasn't been out there before,\" he said. \"It's a multi-year effort, and next year we'll have a much better picture of where slavery is and what changes there are. If you can't measure it, you can't devise policy to address it.\" Countries with highest absolute numbers of slaves Country Estimated slaves India 13.9 million China 2.9 million Pakistan 2.1 million Nigeria 701,000 Ethiopia 651,000 Russia 516,000 Thailand 473,000 D.R.

Bruno Vincent/Getty \n \n Slavery remains a serious global problem, with 29.6 million people in various states of forced servitude, including sexual exploitation, debt bondage and forced marriage, according to a new report. \n \n Mauritania and Haiti have the highest proportions of slaves, while India, Pakistan and China have some of the highest absolute numbers, the Walk Free Foundation said in its first Global Slavery Index report, published Wednesday. The forms of bondage violate international decrees, including the 1926 Slavery Convention, an international treaty, and the UN Trafficking Protocol. \n \n Native-born slaves are often found in poorer countries, while exploited workers from poorer parts of the world regularly end up in rich countries where they are often trafficked. In India, some native-born slaves never leave their own villages, Walk Free found. \n \n \"Today some people are still being born into hereditary slavery, a staggering but harsh reality, particularly in parts of West Africa and South Asia,\" the report states. \n \n \"Other victims are captured or kidnapped before being sold or kept for exploitation, whether through 'marriage,' unpaid labor on fishing boats, or as domestic workers,\" the report continues. \"Others are tricked and lured into situations they cannot escape, with false promises of a good job or an education.\" \n \n The 10 countries with the highest number of enslaved or exploited workers, according to Walk Free, are: India, China, Pakistan, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Russian Federation, Thailand, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Myanmar and Bangladesh. \n \n But Mauritania, with about 150,000 slaves, retains the highest proportion of enslaved people in the world, with aspects of \"chattel slavery\" that harken back to the American experience of the institution, where human beings are considered \"full property of their masters who exercise total ownership over them and their descendants.\" \n \n Many slaves in the West African nation were born into classes that have toiled as slaves for generations.",

With part of this cloud having reached us Sunday morning, aurora watchers are anticipating a great show on Sunday night! \n \n This story has been updated. \n \n \n \n The Sun has continued its quiet progress towards solar minimum - the point in its 11 year cycle where it exhibits the lowest levels of sunspot activity - but on the way there, it can still produce a few surprises. \n \n On Thursday night (early Friday morning, UTC), the larger of two sunspots currently visible on the Earthward side of the Sun blasted out a bright M2-class solar flare. \n \n \n \n Three views of sunspot AR2665, from around 5:00 UTC Friday, July 14, 2017, during the peak of the solar flare.

Credit: NASA/SDO/Scott Sutherland \n \n At the same time as the solar flare was blasting out X-rays, which caused a minor radio blackout over parts of Asia, it also released a massive cloud of solar particles - what's known as a coronal mass ejection. \n \n This coronal mass ejection is mostly aimed ahead of Earth's orbital path, and thus the vast majority of it will miss us. As the cloud expands out into space, however, one end of it is projected to sweep past Earth. \n \n \n \n \n \n Even as this swath of solar particles washes past us, much of it will simply be diverted around the planet, due to the protective effects of Earth's magnetic field. A significant portion of them, though, will become snagged within the field lines, and then funneled down into the upper atmosphere near the planet's poles, to produce bright auroras. \n \n RELATED: What is Light Pollution and how does it affect Canadians? \n \n Currently, NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center is reporting that the Earth-directed portion of the coronal mass ejection arrived earlier than expected. By their observations, we were already seeing G2 (moderate) geomagnetic storm levels as of mid-morning Sunday, and these are expected to persist throughout the afternoon. \n \n \n \n This evening, storm levels are predicted to diminish slightly - to G1 (minor) geomagnetic storm levels - and then jump back up to G2 storm strength between 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. EDT. Afterwards, activity is expected to ramp down to sub-storm levels by Monday morning. \n \n Based on all of this activity, auroras are expected to stretch down over most of Canada and the northern United States tonight, and likely visible as far south as between the Kp=5 (green) and Kp=7 (yellow) lines on the map below. \n \n There is also a chance, during all of this G2 geomagnetic storm activity, that levels could briefly jump as high as G3 (strong), which would push visibility down over the Kp=7 line. \n \n \n \n Remember that it takes reasonably clear and dark skies to see the auroras, far from the light pollution cast by urban environments. Auroras are also notorious for being random and flighty. Sometimes they can appear faint, only to be seen with long-exposure photography, while other times they can be bright and vibrant to the naked eye, and they can appear and disappear quite suddenly. \n \n \n \n If you plan on getting out to watch, choose your location carefully and be safe. In most regions of the country, simply getting outside of your local community is typically good enough. For those living in southwestern Ontario and the GTA, areas north of Stratford, Guelph and Orangeville tend to be good for viewing, as are those areas to the east of Lake Simcoe and north of Peterborough (the shores of Georgian Bay usually provide excellent viewing!). \n \n \n \n Provincial parks are an excellent resource for skywatching, even if you have to stick to the parking lot at night. \n \n As always with these events, give your eyes some time to adjust to the dark - 30-40 minutes typically - or you will likely miss out on it. Avoid all bright sources of light - streetlights, car headlights, cellphone screens & camera flashes, etc - during that time, then look up and to the north to potentially see the auroras. \n \n \n \n Sources: NOAA | spaceweather.com | teaser image courtesy Team Tanner \n \n \n \n Watch Below: Theresa and Darlene Tanner relate their experiences with the Northern Lights and how they take such amazing photographs \n \n \n \n \n \n",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Look up into the skies Sunday night and you might just get to see the aurora borealis, otherwise known as the Northern Lights. Scientists at the NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center say that aurora lights, which are usually only seen in the extreme north and south of the globe, should be visible over much of Canada and the northern United States late Sunday and early Monday, USA Today reports. That includes northern New York state, much of New England, Illinois, Wisconsin, and the Dakotas. The Weather Network, which has a map showing viewing areas, reports that the event was caused by a solar flare that exploded on the sun Thursday night. That flare released a cloud of solar particles, a process known as a coronal mass ejection. When those particles reach the Earth's atmosphere, they interact with atmospheric gases, creating the famed colors of the aurora. At the same time the flare was releasing that cloud of particles, it also emitted X-rays that caused a small radio blackout in Asia. At about 10am Eastern Standard Time Sunday, the National Weather Service announced on Twitter that \"Geomagnetic storm conditions\" had begun. According to its latest forecast, the best viewing will come between sunset and 2am, \"clouds permitting.\"",

The aurora forms when particles flowing from the sun get caught up in the Earth's magnetic field. The particles interact with molecules of atmospheric gases to cause the famed glowing red and green colors of the aurora. The lights are visible in both the far northern and southern parts of the world. The southern lights are known as aurora australis. NOAA has issued a geomagnetic storm watch for the event and expects a \"moderate\" storm, a 2 out of 5 on its severity scale. Sunday night, the aurora borealis should be visible almost as far south as the yellow line on this map.",

    "document": "Brian Williams becomes the next reporter to almost, but not quite, hold Rick Perry to account for the execution of Cameron Todd Willingham. During the GOP debate Wednesday night, Williams asked without naming Willingham, or going at Perry armed with the science that undermined the prosecution's case. (A pity: this came on the heels of the moderators trying to get Perry in a spat with Jon Huntsman about who was \"anti-science.\") \n \n Williams simply asked in general if Perry had ever struggled with the idea that someone who was killed via capital punishment was innocent. The weak sauce allowed Perry to wriggle off the hook: \"No, sir. I've never struggled with that at all. The state of Texas has a very thoughtful, a very clear process in place of which -- when someone commits the most heinous of crimes against our citizens, they get a fair hearing, they go through an appellate process, they go up to the Supreme Court of the United States, if that's required. \n \n \"But in the state of Texas, if you come into our state and you kill one of our children, you kill a police officer, you're involved with another crime and you kill one of our citizens, you will face the ultimate justice in the state of Texas, and that is, you will be executed.\" \n \n After 18 years of incarceration and countless protestations of innocence, Anthony Graves finally got a nod of approval from the one person who mattered Wednesday and at last returned home -- free from charges that he participated in the butchery of a family in Somerville he did not know and free of the possibility that he would have to answer for them with his life. The district attorney for Washington and Burleson counties, Bill Parham, gave Graves his release. The prosecutor filed a motion to dismiss charges that had sent Graves to Texas' death row for most of his adult life. Graves returned to his mother's home in Brenham no longer the \"cold-blooded killer,\" so characterized by the prosecutor who first tried him, but as another exonerated inmate who even in the joy of redemption will face the daunting prospect of reassembling the pieces of a shattered life. \"He's an innocent man,\" Parham said, noting that his office investigated the case for five months. \"There is nothing that connects Anthony Graves to this crime. I did what I did because that's the right thing to do.\" \n \n It's worth worrying about! \n \n Williams plodded ahead with a sentimental follow-up, asking Perry to react to the fact that members of the audience applauded when hearing Perry has executed 234 individuals. Perry replied, \"I think Americans understand justice. I think Americans are clearly, in the vast majority of -- of cases, supportive of capital punishment. When you have committed heinous crimes against our citizens -- and it's a state-by-state issue, but in the state of Texas, our citizens have made that decision, and they made it clear, and they don't want you to commit those crimes against our citizens. And if you do, you will face the ultimate justice. \n \n But what if scientists say you sent a man to his death for having committed no crime at all?

Flames spread along the walls, bursting through doorways, blistering paint and tiles and furniture. Smoke pressed against the ceiling, then banked downward, seeping into each room and through crevices in the windows, staining the morning sky. \n \n Buffie Barbee, who was eleven years old and lived two houses down, was playing in her back yard when she smelled the smoke. She ran inside and told her mother, Diane, and they hurried up the street; that\u2019s when they saw the smoldering house and Cameron Todd Willingham standing on the front porch, wearing only a pair of jeans, his chest blackened with soot, his hair and eyelids singed. He was screaming, \u201cMy babies are burning up!\u201d His children\u2014Karmon and Kameron, who were one-year-old twin girls, and two-year-old Amber\u2014were trapped inside. \n \n Willingham told the Barbees to call the Fire Department, and while Diane raced down the street to get help he found a stick and broke the children\u2019s bedroom window. Fire lashed through the hole. He broke another window; flames burst through it, too, and he retreated into the yard, kneeling in front of the house. A neighbor later told police that Willingham intermittently cried, \u201cMy babies!\u201d then fell silent, as if he had \u201cblocked the fire out of his mind.\u201d \n \n Diane Barbee, returning to the scene, could feel intense heat radiating off the house. Moments later, the five windows of the children\u2019s room exploded and flames \u201cblew out,\u201d as Barbee put it. Within minutes, the first firemen had arrived, and Willingham approached them, shouting that his children were in their bedroom, where the flames were thickest. A fireman sent word over his radio for rescue teams to \u201cstep on it.\u201d \n \n More men showed up, uncoiling hoses and aiming water at the blaze. One fireman, who had an air tank strapped to his back and a mask covering his face, slipped through a window but was hit by water from a hose and had to retreat. He then charged through the front door, into a swirl of smoke and fire. Heading down the main corridor, he reached the kitchen, where he saw a refrigerator blocking the back door. \n \n Todd Willingham, looking on, appeared to grow more hysterical, and a police chaplain named George Monaghan led him to the back of a fire truck and tried to calm him down. Willingham explained that his wife, Stacy, had gone out earlier that morning, and that he had been jolted from sleep by Amber screaming, \u201cDaddy! Daddy!\u201d \n \n \u201cMy little girl was trying to wake me up and tell me about the fire,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI couldn\u2019t get my babies out.\u201d \n \n While he was talking, a fireman emerged from the house, cradling Amber. As she was given C.P.R., Willingham, who was twenty-three years old and powerfully built, ran to see her, then suddenly headed toward the babies\u2019 room. Monaghan and another man restrained him. \u201cWe had to wrestle with him and then handcuff him, for his and our protection,\u201d Monaghan later told police. \u201cI received a black eye.\u201d One of the first firemen at the scene told investigators that, at an earlier point, he had also held Willingham back. \u201cBased on what I saw on how the fire was burning, it would have been crazy for anyone to try and go into the house,\u201d he said. \n \n Willingham was taken to a hospital, where he was told that Amber\u2014who had actually been found in the master bedroom\u2014had died of smoke inhalation. Kameron and Karmon had been lying on the floor of the children\u2019s bedroom, their bodies severely burned. According to the medical examiner, they, too, died from smoke inhalation. \n \n News of the tragedy, which took place on December 23, 1991, spread through Corsicana. A small city fifty-five miles northeast of Waco, it had once been the center of Texas\u2019s first oil boom, but many of the wells had since dried up, and more than a quarter of the city\u2019s twenty thousand inhabitants had fallen into poverty. Several stores along the main street were shuttered, giving the place the feel of an abandoned outpost. \n \n Willingham and his wife, who was twenty-two years old, had virtually no money. Stacy worked in her brother\u2019s bar, called Some Other Place, and Willingham, an unemployed auto mechanic, had been caring for the kids. The community took up a collection to help the Willinghams pay for funeral arrangements. \n \n Fire investigators, meanwhile, tried to determine the cause of the blaze. (Willingham gave authorities permission to search the house: \u201cI know we might not ever know all the answers, but I\u2019d just like to know why my babies were taken from me.\u201d) Douglas Fogg, who was then the assistant fire chief in Corsicana, conducted the initial inspection. He was tall, with a crew cut, and his voice was raspy from years of inhaling smoke from fires and cigarettes. He had grown up in Corsicana and, after graduating from high school, in 1963, he had joined the Navy, serving as a medic in Vietnam, where he was wounded on four occasions. He was awarded a Purple Heart each time. After he returned from Vietnam, he became a firefighter, and by the time of the Willingham blaze he had been battling fire\u2014or what he calls \u201cthe beast\u201d\u2014for more than twenty years, and had become a certified arson investigator. \u201cYou learn that fire talks to you,\u201d he told me. \n \n He was soon joined on the case by one of the state\u2019s leading arson sleuths, a deputy fire marshal named Manuel Vasquez, who has since died. Short, with a paunch, Vasquez had investigated more than twelve hundred fires. Arson investigators have always been considered a special breed of detective. In the 1991 movie \u201cBackdraft,\u201d a heroic arson investigator says of fire, \u201cIt breathes, it eats, and it hates. The only way to beat it is to think like it. To know that this flame will spread this way across the door and up across the ceiling.\u201d Vasquez, who had previously worked in Army intelligence, had several maxims of his own. One was \u201cFire does not destroy evidence\u2014it creates it.\u201d Another was \u201cThe fire tells the story. I am just the interpreter.\u201d He cultivated a Sherlock Holmes-like aura of invincibility. Once, he was asked under oath whether he had ever been mistaken in a case. \u201cIf I have, sir, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he responded. \u201cIt\u2019s never been pointed out.\u201d",

The Brad Pitt/Jennifer Aniston bash-fest plot thickens. The latest piece of succulent gossip to drip from the ripe, fruit-bearing tree? It's two-fold, actually. One part says that Jennifer Aniston's team \"went ballistic\" when they got wind of Pitt's asinine comments; the other part says that Pitt's asinine comments actually came from a place of jealousy. As in Brad, although blissfully in love with Angelina Jolie, is actually jealous that Jennifer's so in love. \n \n Hmm ... did Jennifer's team actually go ballistic? And are they the savviest people in the whole wide world, spinning the jealousy angle? Or is it true, Brad really is jealous? \n \n Of course, no one will ever know for sure, as, well, everything in Hollywood needs to be taken with a heaping spoonful of salt, but it does make for an interesting discussion. Shall we? \n \n First, let's start with the deets. Apparently after the rude comments Pitt made to Parade magazine -- and Team Aniston's going ballistic -- they reached out to Brad's camp and \"read him the riot act.\" Then, a short while later, Brad gave his jank explanation, saying that what he said was taken out of context, Jennifer's a wonderful woman, blah blah blah yawn lies. Now here comes the interesting part. That same source who leaked this information to the press is saying that the real reason for Pitt's comments is because he's jealous of Justin Theroux. Hmph. \n \n Here's what I believe. Well, a little of all of it, actually. I don't doubt for a second that Jen's team went bonkers after getting wind of the news -- and that's natural; their job is to protect her. I also believe that they \"read him the riot act,\" which, in turn, made him apologize, which, in turn, makes him an even bigger jerk since everything he said after the fact was disingenuous poppycock. I also kind of believe that he is, in fact, a little bit jealous that Jen's really happy with Justin. That's natural, too. They were married, after all, and human beings will be human beings. Where this whole \"jealousy\" thing is coming from, though? Eh, not really going to chalk that one up as a fact. In other words, I certainly don't think Brad ever overtly expressed anything like that. I think it's just something Jennifer Aniston's \"people\" are saying to make him look bad. \n \n And it's kind of genius. 'Cause it's totally working. \n \n What do you believe? \n \n Image via chris_natt/Flickr ||||| Cover Story: Jen Aniston's Team \"Went Ballistic\" After Brad Pitt Insult \n \n Brad Pitt made a big-time boo-boo. \n \n He's garnering Oscar buzz for his role in Moneyball, but Angelina Jolie's man sparked a public relations catastrophe last week -- all for a Parade interview in which he casually slammed his five-year marriage to Jennifer Aniston, which ended in 2005. \n \n PHOTOS: Brad and Jen, the way they were \n \n (In the interview released Sept. 15, Pitt, 47, sniffed that he \"wasn't living an interesting life\" before Jolie, and that he was \"trying to pretend my marriage was something that it wasn't.\") \n \n And, yes, his 42-year-old ex-wife got wind of the catty comment. \"She was annoyed,\" a pal close to the Horrible Bosses actress tells the new Us Weekly, out now. \"She thought it was rude and inappropriate.\" \n \n Team Aniston -- her agent and publicists -- \"went ballistic,\" a Pitt insider reveals, and angrily reached out to Pitt's camp. \n \n PHOTOS: When exes attack \n \n \"They got his team involved and Brad was read the riot act -- the only way you can read the riot act to Brad Pitt,\" the source says. \n \n Within 24 hours, Pitt had surprisingly released a statement lamenting that his words were misinterpreted, and that his former love \"is an incredibly giving, loving and hilarious woman.\" \n \n PHOTOS: Justin Theroux, Angelina Jolie -- separated at birth? \n \n Still, the Pitt source says, \"no one believes his words were taken out of context -- he said what he said.

Under pressure from government, banks are already saying they will devote the smallest percentage of annual revenues in years to their employees. But the raw numbers will still be big enough to provoke public anger, while also prompting internal dissent from traders and bankers who will see a larger share of their bonuses deferred. \u2026 Indeed, a political response by Washington to the U.K. government\u2019s supertax on bonuses looms. The pay plans Wall Street will soon unveil are unlikely to dissuade the Obama administration from its own effort to curb compensation. \u2026 People close to Morgan Stanley said it would unveil its lowest compensation ratio in at least three years.\u201d \n \n \n \n BANKERS ARE NOT HAPPY; FACE \u201cLIQUIDITY ISSUE\u201d: WSJ\u2019s Susanne Craig, David Enrich and Robin Sidel on pg. 1: \u201c[Bankers are] complaining too much of the payout is coming in stock instead of cash. Banks and securities firms have told workers their bonuses will contain a bigger percentage of stock to demonstrate that Wall Street is sensitive to public anger over the big paychecks. \u2026 Some employees say the shift could leave them short of cash, since stock comes with restrictions on how quickly it can be sold. And since many people plan their household budgets around bonus expectations, they may need the cash to cover mortgages, school tuition and other expenses. \"I don't think it's just whining,\" said one person at a Wall Street firm. \"There are legitimate liquidity issues that people have.\" \n \n \n \n FROM SUNDAY NYT FRONT ON BONUSES by Louise Story and Eric \u201cPittsburgh Flash\u201d Dash: \u201cSome bankers worry that the United States, like Britain, might create an extra tax on bank bonuses, and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, Democrat of Ohio, is proposing legislation to do so. \u2026 Goldman Sachs is expected to pay its employees an average of about $595,000 apiece for 2009, one of the most profitable years in its 141-year history. Workers in the investment bank of JPMorgan Chase stand to collect about $463,000 on average. \u2026 At Citigroup \u2026 some managers were disappointed in recent weeks by the preliminary estimates of their bonus pools. \u2026 Citigroup\u2019s overall 2009 bonus pool is expected to be about $5.3 billion, about the same as it was for 2008, although the bank has far fewer employees.\u201d GOLDMAN MAY REQUIRE MORE FROM EXECS, reports NYT\u2019s Louise Story on today\u2019s B1: \u201cGoldman Sachs is considering expanding a program that would require executives and top managers to give a certain percentage of their earnings to charity. The move would be the latest in a series of initiatives by Goldman to soften criticism over the size of its bonuses, which are expected to be among the largest on Wall Street, bringing average pay to about $595,000 for each employee \u2014 with far higher amounts for top performers. \u2026 While the details of the latest charity initiative are still under discussion, the firm\u2019s executives have been looking at expanding their current charitable requirements for months and trying to understand whether such gestures would damp public anger over pay.\u201d \n \n \n \n FEDS WIELD MORE POWER OVER BANK HIRES, report FT\u2019s Brooke Masters and Francesco Guerrara: \u201cU.S. banking supervisors are taking a much more active hand in shaping banks\u2019 top personnel decisions, as regulators seek to prevent a recurrence of management failures that helped precipitate the financial crisis. \u2026 [S]upervisors at the [Fed and FDIC] are asking more questions about potential appointees than they did two years ago. \u2026 Federal involvement is strongest at the very largest banks that were among the last to repay billions of dollars in government loans, such as Citigroup and Bank of America. \n \n \n \n FRANK RICH PREVIEWS THE CRISIS PANEL, in Sunday\u2019s NYT: \u201cPhil Angelides, the former California treasurer who is the inquiry\u2019s chairman, told me in interviews late last year that he has been busy deploying a tough investigative staff and will not allow the proceedings to devolve into a typical blue-ribbon Beltway exercise in toothless bloviation. \u2026He understands that if he fails to make news or to tell the story in a way that is comprehensible and compelling enough to arouse Americans to demand action, Wall Street and Washington will both keep moving on, unchallenged and unchastened.\u201d MORE DUMPING ON BERNANKE\u2019S ATLANTA SPEECH: American Prospect\u2019s Robert Kuttner: \u201cBernanke's high-profile speech to the American Economic Association in Atlanta, January 3, was his latest effort to redeem himself. But it provides ample evidence for why the Senate should deny him a second term. \u2026 It was easy money combined with the complete abdication of the Federal Reserve's role as a regulator that allowed Wall Street to go nuts, creating a financial house of cards. \u2026 Bernanke's speech passed up the opportunity to confess any error or personal learning curve.\u201d EARNINGS WILL BE BETTER, BUT IT\u2019S ALL RELATIVE, WSJ\u2019s Paul Glader: \u201cWhile fourth-quarter earnings doubtless will be far above what they were a year earlier, that largely reflects the deep hole companies were in at the end of 2008, as well as heavy cost-cutting since. Indeed, one picture likely to emerge in the next few weeks is that companies remain too cautious and sales too weak to spur much new business investment or hiring. \u2026 Reports from producers of commodities like oil, lumber and metals also will give a read on underlying demand. Alcoa Inc. will post results after the market closes on Monday, and analysts believe it will show a return to profit.\u201d \n \n \n \n HOW GOOD WILL THEY BE? Bloomberg BusinessWeek\u2019s David Bogoslaw: \u201cThe weekly outlook published by Thomson Reuters on Jan. 8 estimated a 184% increase in profits for the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The highest year-over-year growth rates are expected in financials (up to $2.4 billion, from -$81 billion a year ago), materials (up 163% to $3.0 billion) and consumer discretionary (up 114% to $15.5 billion), while the lowest anticipated growth is in energy (down 24% to $18.5 billion) and industrials (down 13% to $154.8 billion). MORE TRANSACTION/BONUS TAX TALK, from NYPOST\u2019s Josh Kosman and Mark DeCambre: \u201cAccording to two people familiar with the matter, the White House has circulated a draft budget, and in it is a line under the revenue category that reads, \u2018Wall Street and taxes.\u2019 The vague reference to Wall Street offers no details about what kind of tax or an amount the administration hopes to collect, according to two sources, one a high-ranking executive at a bulge-bracket firm and the other a person close to the Treasury Department \u2026 [O]ne source said Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is disinclined to impose that kind of tax because it could be disruptive to the markets. \u2018Treasury would never agree to a transaction tax,\u2019 this person said. \n \n \n \n What is more likely on the table, the sources said, is a tax on bonuses, though such a move could be disruptive to New York.\u201d \n \n \n \n A UNIT GROWS AT CITI, WITH GOV'T.

The Treasury gave the bank a second big helping of $20 billion just six weeks after an initial $25 billion infusion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, partly in recognition of GTS's importance to the financial system, according to government and company officials.\u201d \n \n \n \n IS CHINA THE NEXT REAL ESTATE BUBBLE? WaPo\u2019s Steve Mufson in Beijing on pg. A1: \u201cWith property prices soaring in key cities, many investors and bankers worry that China has the next great real estate bubble waiting to be popped. ... On Sunday, the nation's cabinet, citing \u2018excessively rising house prices\u2019 in some cities, said it will monitor capital flows to \u2018stop overseas speculative funds from jeopardizing China's property market.\u2019 \u2026 For investors, many of the usual bubble warning signs are flashing. Fueled by low interest rates, prices in Shanghai and Beijing doubled in less than four years, then doubled again. Most Chinese home buyers expect that today's high prices will climb even higher tomorrow, so they are stretching to pay prices at the edge of their means or beyond.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ||||| Associated Press \n \n WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is aiming to hit banks with a fee to recoup losses associated with the government's bailout of financial firms and the auto industry, administration officials say. \n \n The White House hopes the fee will soothe the public's anger at financial firms. Most big banks that received public funds have repaid the government, but the industry is seen by many as having survived thanks to taxpayer support, and is now enjoying a profit rebound as the economy struggles. This month, many large banks will resume paying big bonuses to employees. \n \n New Fees Could Take a Swipe at Bank Profits 1:45 The Obama administration is likely to slap banks with a fee designed to recoup losses associated with TARP, in a move that could help lower the deficit and reduce risk-taking by big banks. WSJ's Deborah Solomon reports. \n \n PM Report: Bonus Backlash 8:58 WSJ's Jerry Seib joins The News Hub to preview his piece looking at whether populist outrage at Washington could be turned toward Wall Street instead. Plus, Simon Cowell says he's leaving \"American Idol\" and former slugger Mark McGwire admits he used steroids when he broke baseball's home run record in 1998. \n \n Much remains uncertain about how such a fee would work. The administration is wrestling with who should pay, when it should be implemented and what would happen if banks pay more than the government-bailout program ultimately loses. Auto makers aren't currently targets of the fee idea. \n \n Even though the proposal is still under discussion, it is expected to be included in the White House's budget, due next month, if only conceptually. It's expected to cost large banks billions of dollars and could also affect bank customers if firms pass along the cost. \n \n One option under consideration involves placing a fee on a bank's liabilities, a number that theoretically represents the amount of risk a bank takes on, according to officials familiar with the matter. That approach would also have the effect of tamping down banks' risky behavior, another administration goal. Another option would be to target bank profits, these people said. \n \n It's unclear precisely who would be subject to the fee. A person familiar with the matter said it's unlikely for now to target auto companies or American International Group Inc., all of which are still struggling. Homeowners who benefited from government-funded housing help also wouldn't pay the fee. \n \n A person familiar with the matter said it would make little sense to impose a fee on auto makers or AIG right now: The government owns such a large chunk of them, it would essentially result in the government paying itself. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Getty Images Barney Frank, House Financial Services Committee Chairman, favors levy to recoup TARP costs. \n \n Some within the administration believe targeting banks is justified because they benefited the most from the overall financial rescue and should bear the brunt of helping the government recoup the cost. \n \n The proposal comes as the White House and many banks are locked in a feud about whether financial companies are doing enough to revitalize the economy. \n \n The fee would likely be designed to avoid hitting certain segments of the financial industry, such as community banks, many of which are still struggling. The administration is trying to structure the fee so that it can't be passed along to bank customers already struggling in the weak economy, but officials concede that's hard to do. In other areas, such as overdraft fees and credit cards, banks already are passing costs of new legislation on to their customers. \n \n \"In our industry, costs are typically passed along to institutions and individual investors, so the burden will likely fall on them,\" said Timothy Ryan, president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Major banks declined to comment. \n \n The administration has been talking for months about recouping government funds likely lost through the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, as it is required to do under the legislation that created the program. The Treasury Department estimates losses from the program at $120 billion, though administration officials believe the ultimate cost will be much lower. \n \n The fee, which would require congressional approval, could hit big banks that have already repaid their TARP funds with interest. The money would be used to compensate for losses in other areas, such as loans to Detroit's auto makers and funds used to prop up the housing sector and giant insurer AIG. \n \n Bankers view the proposal as the latest assault on an industry still recovering from the financial meltdown. Although revenue at some big banks has returned to pre-crisis levels, the industry more broadly remains troubled, with many more banks expected to fail. \n \n \"To impose yet another burden on the industry would obviously decrease their ability to lend,\" said Edward Yingling, president of the American Bankers Association, a trade group. Bankers say they've already contributed through sums they paid to escape TARP and fees levied by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to build up its deposit-insurance fund. \n \n House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank (D., Mass.) said legislation that created TARP mandated that the government recoup its costs by 2013. Since the program is winding down faster than expected, a levy now would be appropriate. \n \n \"Given the mood of the country,\" he said, \"it is essential that we do it. That was part of the deal.\" He declined to get into specifics about such a levy. \n \n He said it would be unfair to make banks subsidize money given to auto companies, which could eventually account for the lion's share of lost bailout funds. It would be \"premature\" to force repayment from General Motors Co. and Chrysler LLC, he said, but some repayment mechanism for the auto companies should be considered. \n \n White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Monday declined to say whether the budget will include a new fee on banks. He did say President Barack Obama wants to make sure taxpayers are repaid for the financial-sector bailout. \n \n \u2014Jonathan Weisman and Henry J.

Palmer, in Zimbabwe in 2015 set off an international outcry and drew new scrutiny to the practice of paying to kill big game. Two years later, the lion\u2019s son Xanda was killed in a trophy hunt near the same park. \n \n Since then, photographs of hunters posing triumphantly with the bodies of animals such as giraffes and a family of baboons have stirred global condemnation. In the latter case, the Idaho fish and game commissioner seen grinning with an array of carcasses from an African hunting trip resigned. \n \n While many defenders of hunting see it as an honorable, skilled and bonding experience, others denounce it as unnecessary waste in the modern age and detrimental to the environment and to the animals who roam in the wild. But the issue is more complex than a clash of cultures. \n \n Some countries like Zimbabwe encourage big-game hunting as a source of income, and others allow the activity to keep down herd populations through managed hunting trips and as a way to pay for the upkeep of game reserves. ||||| An American media personality and avid hunter caused an uproar after killing wild goats in Scotland and posing with their carcasses. \n \n Larysa Switlyk, who hosts the online hunting show \"Larysa Unleashed,\" received a barrage of tweets after she shared a number of photos from a recent hunting trip in Islay, Scotland. One photo shows Switlyk holding up the head of a wild goat she shot. \"We hunted hard for a big one for 2 days and finally got on this group. Made a perfect 200 yard shot,\" she wrote. A second photo showed one of her hunting partners with another dead wild goat. \n \n Several Twitter users said the photos Switlyk shared were \"disgraceful\" and \"sickening.\" Some Twitter users tagged Scottish legislators, receiving responses from the first minister and secretary for environment. \n \n \u201cA unique hunt?\u201d \n \n Disgraceful.

    "document": "Andrew Gillum addresses his supporters after winning the Democrat primary for governor on Tuesday, Aug. 28, 2018, in Tallahassee, Fla. (AP Photo/Steve Cannon) (Associated Press) \n \n Andrew Gillum addresses his supporters after winning the Democrat primary for governor on Tuesday, Aug. 28, 2018, in Tallahassee, Fla. (AP Photo/Steve Cannon) (Associated Press) \n \n TALLAHASSEE, Florida (AP) \u2014 A liberal Florida Democrat pulled off an upset victory while President Donald Trump's favored candidate cruised to an easy win Tuesday, setting up a fierce showdown for the governor's mansion in the nation's largest political battleground. \n \n Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, an unabashed progressive, won the Democratic primary, moving him a step away from becoming the state's first black governor. He'll face off against Trump-backed Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis. \n \n DeSantis gave Trump credit for his victory, saying that with one supportive tweet, the president \"kind of put me on the map.\" Gillum is his party's third black gubernatorial nominee this year, along with Stacey Abrams in Georgia and Ben Jealous in Maryland. \n \n The results immediately transformed the Florida race into one of the most closely watched gubernatorial campaigns in the country. Gillum's primary victory could help Democrats boost enthusiasm among minorities who often don't vote in large numbers in years when a presidential candidate isn't on the ballot. Meanwhile, DeSantis will test Trump's grip on a crucial state he won in 2016 and wants to keep in his column in 2020. \n \n DeSantis was one of several Republicans running in contests Tuesday in Florida and Arizona \u2014 another closely watched political battleground \u2014 who hoped that cozying up to the president would be rewarded by voters. Trump has thrust himself into the forefront of the midterm campaign in hopes of motivating his supporters and offsetting Democratic enthusiasm. \n \n In Arizona, primary contests were shadowed by the death of Sen. John McCain. Though McCain was a towering figure who was elected to the Senate by Arizonans six times, the three Republican candidates running to replace his retiring seat-mate, Sen. Jeff Flake \u2014 including establishment favorite Rep. Martha McSally \u2014 aligned themselves more with the president than the longtime senator. \n \n Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey planned to name a replacement to fill McCain's seat after his funeral. \n \n Polls closed in Arizona at the end of a day that began with delayed openings at dozens of polling locations in the state's largest county. Leaders in Maricopa County rejected calls to try to keep polls open later, saying it may confuse voters and delay returns. No problems were reported elsewhere in the state. \n \n Elsewhere Tuesday, GOP voters in reliably Republican Oklahoma backed mortgage company owner Kevin Stitt in a runoff for the gubernatorial nomination. Stitt won in part by criticizing his opponent as insufficiently supportive of Trump. \n \n Trump surprised Florida Republicans late last year with his endorsement of DeSantis, and frequently tweeted about the lawmaker, one of his staunchest supporters in Washington. His backing helped push DeSantis past Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, who has held elected office in Florida since 1996, quickly built up establishment support and raised millions of dollars. \n \n Gillum came from behind in a crowded and diverse Democratic field. Former Rep. Gwen Graham, whose father, Bob Graham, served as governor, had hoped to position herself to become the state's first female governor. \n \n Gillum, a favorite of progressives, spent the least of the five major Democratic candidates and had the smallest television presence. He often said he was the only candidate in the race who wasn't a millionaire or billionaire, and won the endorsement of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \n \n At a victory party in Tallahassee, Gillum thanked supporters who \"took hold of our vision and our mission and our plan for a state that makes room for all of us, not just the well-heeled and the well-connected, but all of us.\" \n \n The winner of the Florida governor's race will give his or her party an advantage in a key political battleground heading into the 2020 presidential campaign. \n \n Florida Gov. Rick Scott is vacating the governor's mansion to run for Senate. He easily won his primary, setting up a showdown with Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson that is expected to be one of the nation's most competitive races. \n \n Democrats also eyed pickup opportunities in Florida as they try to flip control of the U.S. House. One of their best chances is in South Florida, where Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen is retiring in a district that should favor Democrats. \n \n Donna Shalala, who served as President Bill Clinton's Health and Human Services secretary, claimed the Democratic nomination in Ros-Lehtinen's district. \n \n The contests in both Florida and Arizona were being closely watched for signs of how the political battlegrounds might tilt in the 2020 presidential election. \n \n McCain's death has highlighted anew the shift in the Republican Party since he captured the GOP nomination for president in 2008. With his consistently conservative voting record, Arizonans elected McCain to the Senate six times, including in 2016. But his more moderate stance on immigration and his deciding vote last year against Trump's efforts to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law turned off many GOP voters. \n \n A CNN survey in June found that 67 percent of Democrats had a favorable opinion of McCain, while just 33 percent of Republicans did. \n \n Among those on the Arizona ballot was former state Sen. Kelli Ward, who tried unsuccessfully to unseat McCain in 2016. When McCain's family said last week that he was discontinuing medical treatment, Ward speculated in a later-deleted Facebook post that the announcement was intended to hurt her campaign for Flake's seat. \n \n Ward apologized Monday, saying she was bemoaning media coverage rather than the family's announcement. \n \n \"I do understand how many could have misconstrued my comments as insensitive, and for this I apologize,\" Ward said. \n \n Also running for the Senate nomination was former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, the controversial immigration hardliner. Trump spared Arpaio a possible jail sentence last year by pardoning his federal conviction stemming from immigration patrols. \n \n McSally, a fighter pilot turned congresswoman in the McCain mold, was hoping Ward and Arpaio split Arizona's anti-establishment vote. \n \n The winner of the GOP primary is likely to face Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who had only token primary opposition. Sinema announced that she was pausing her campaign Wednesday and Thursday, when McCain's body will lie in Arizona's Capitol. \n \n Sinema's and McSally's Senate runs also have created House openings in Arizona, a fast-growing and increasingly diverse state where Democrats are eager to gain a foothold. McSally's district in particular is expected to be one of the most competitive House races in November's general election. \n \n ___ \n \n Pace reported from Washington.

Learn more ||||| Andrew Gillum has become the first African-American nominee for Florida governor, pulling off an upset win over favorite Gwen Graham and two big-spending businessmen in a crowded Democratic primary field. \n \n The Tallahassee mayor will face Jacksonville congressman Ron DeSantis, who easily defeated state agriculture commissioner Adam Putnam thanks to the backing of President Donald Trump. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring this thing home,\u201d Gillum told his election night gathering in Tallahassee. \u201cAs the mayor of Florida\u2019s capital city, I humbly accept the Democratic nomination.\u201d \n \n Gillum never led in any public polling, but was showing signs of gaining momentum in the final weeks. He benefited from being chosen by the progressive wing of the party\u2019s most generous benefactors \u2015 including billionaires Tom Steyer and George Soros \u2015 as well as from a barrage of negative ads against Graham by billionaire Jeff Greene. \n \n Greene wound up finishing fourth in the five-way pack, but he spent $10 million on ads attacking Graham \u2015 more than she spent on television on her own behalf. Liberal outside groups, meanwhile, coalesced around Gillum and served as his turnout operation, particularly in urban areas with large concentrations of younger and minority voters. \n \n Gillum, 39, had difficulty raising money for his campaign after the revelation that the FBI was investigating Tallahassee city government. He says he heard he is not a target of the probe, but one of his closest friends and a former political ally has been the subject of federal subpoenas examining a restaurant he developed in part using city money. \n \n Gillum wound up raising the least money of the five candidates \u2015 $8.4 million between his campaign and a political committee under his control. In contrast, Greene raised $43 million, $40 million from himself. And Miami Beach Mayor Phil Levine, who started airing TV ads 10 months ago and led the race for several months, raised a total of $41 million, of which $29.5 million was his own cash. \n \n But throughout the race, Gillum\u2019s embrace of progressive ideals such as Medicare for all and his engaging public speaking style made him a favorite of the party\u2019s most liberal activists. In the final weeks, he was endorsed by Vermont senator and 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who campaigned with Gillum in the closing days of the race. \n \n Gillum cut his teeth on political activism as a student government leader at Florida A&M University just a few blocks from Florida\u2019s Capitol, where he led protests against Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s plan to revamp the state\u2019s affirmative action programs. He went to work for People for the American Way before running for a seat on the Tallahassee City Commission in 2003. He became the city\u2019s mayor in 2014. \n \n Christopher Aluka Berry/Reuters Andrew Gillum addresses the audience at the Netroots Nation annual conference for political progressives in Atlanta on Aug. 10, 2017. \n \n The Florida gubernatorial race will now become a referendum on Trump\u2019s presidency, with Gillum painting DeSantis as a Trump clone and DeSantis hoping to bring out as many Trump voters as he can in November. \n \n Trump has spent winter weekends and holidays at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach for years and considers himself a part-time resident of the state. It is unclear how frequently, if at all, he will campaign for DeSantis in the two months leading up to the Nov. 6 general election. Whether Republicans retain control of Congress could determine the survival of the Trump presidency, and his political advisers may choose to focus his time on House and Senate seats. \n \n Trump campaigned with DeSantis only once during the primary, at a rally in Tampa in July, and sent out a handful of supportive statements on Twitter, including the message \u201cVOTE FOR RON\u201d in all capitals late Monday. But in a GOP primary electorate bearing little resemblance to the one that supported former Gov. Jeb Bush and former U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, Trump\u2019s seal of approval allowed DeSantis to overcome enormous disadvantages in cash and traditional support. \n \n The state Republican establishment was solidly behind Putnam even before he announced his candidacy. From a cattle ranching and citrus family in the heart of the state, Putnam had been grooming himself for this run from the time he graduated college. He won a state legislative seat at age 22, then moved to Congress four years later, returning to Florida in 2010 to run for state agriculture commissioner. \n \n He served two terms, coinciding with Rick Scott\u2019s years as governor, and had appeared the heir apparent to the job as Scott leaves because of term limits. \n \n DeSantis, in contrast, entered politics just six years ago, when he ran for Congress from the wealthy suburbs of Jacksonville, his hometown, after serving as a Navy prosecutor. His deployment to Iraq during President George W. Bush\u2019s \u201ctroop surge\u201d there was a highlight of his biography on the campaign trail. Despite the populist, pro-Trump rhetoric he has delivered for years from the Fox TV studio near the U.S. Capitol, DeSantis graduated from Yale and received a law degree from Harvard. \n \n Carlos Barria/Reuters President Donald Trump talks with Ron DeSantis during a Make America Great Again Rally at the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa, Florida, on July 31, 2018. \n \n And while Putnam also praised Trump repeatedly on the campaign trail, his standing with Trump likely was irreparably damaged in October 2016 after the release of the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape that featured Trump bragging that his celebrity enabled him to grab women by the genitals. Putnam criticized Trump for the remarks, while DeSantis did not. \n \n DeSantis leaned on Trump\u2019s approval heavily, mentioning it often in stump speeches and in TV ads. He even produced an ad using his young children as props, dressing up his infant in a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d onesie. \n \n Yet while DeSantis\u2019 love for and from Trump clearly helped him against Putnam in the Republican primary, it may wind up hurting him in the November election against Gillum. Trump is not popular with many independents and even some moderate Republicans. Democrat Margaret Good defeated the son of sitting Republican congressman Vern Buchanan in a special election for a state House seat in Sarasota earlier this year, even though the district leans solidly Republican. \n \n Florida Democrats have not won a governor\u2019s race since 1994, when Lawton Chiles won a second term by defeating Republican Jeb Bush. The party has come within a single percentage point in both 2010 and 2014, losing both times to Scott. ||||| President Trump\u2019s favored candidate, GOP Rep. Ron DeSantis, defeated state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam in Florida\u2019s Republican gubernatorial primary on Tuesday after riding the wave of the president's enthusiastic endorsement to victory. \n \n Meanwhile, the Bernie Sanders-backed Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum pulled off a major upset in defeating a half a dozen rivals, including former Rep. Gwen Graham, in the Democratic primary. \n \n DeSantis and Gillum will face each other in November's general election. If he triumphs, Gillum would be the state's first black governor. \n \n During a celebration event in Orlando, DeSantis thanked the president for \"viewing me as somebody who could be a great leader for Florida.\" \n \n \"Our victory is a good victory, anyways,\" DeSantis said, complimenting Putnam on a hard-fought race. \"But man, to beat someone of his caliber is a big, big deal.\" \n \n The president repeatedly had implored voters to support DeSantis over Putnam. Trump offered his congratulations on Twitter. \n \n \"Such a fantastic win for Ron DeSantis and the people of the Great State of Florida,\" Trump tweeted. \"Ron will be a fantastic Governor. On to November!\" \n \n Appearing on the \"Ingraham Angle\" later, DeSantis downplayed the notion that his win was due to the president's backing, and touted his record on combatting environmental problems, illegal immigration, and education reform. \n \n \"We've been talking about these key issues time and time again and we're going to continue to do that and spread the message far and wide,\" he said. \n \n Gillum, Tallahassee\u2019s progressive mayor backed by the Democratic-socialist Sanders, shocked observers with his win, as Graham, the daughter of former Florida Governor and Sen. Bob Graham, led in pre-election polls. \n \n \"I'm truly honored to represent people across the state as the Democratic nominee -- and I promise to stand up for everyday Floridians and the issues that matter most,\" Gillum tweeted after his win. \n \n Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic socialist star running for New York's 14th district, praised Gillum for staking out liberal positions by supporting Medicare for all, legalizing marijuana and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). \n \n \u201cThe progressive movement is transforming the country - and he proved that again tonight,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. \n \n In the state's closely-watched Senate contest, Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott on Tuesday easily won the GOP nomination. He faced a challenge from perennial candidate Roque De La Fuente. \n \n \"Congratulations to Governor Rick Scott of Florida on his conclusive Republican Primary Win,\" Trump, who encouraged Scott to run, tweeted. \"He will be a great Senator!\" \n \n Scott, who is term-limited as governor, is set to face incumbent Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in what surely will be one of the most closely watched Senate races in November. Nelson ran unopposed in the Democratic primary. \n \n But much of the attention in the run-up to Tuesday's vote had been on the contentious Republican gubernatorial primary between DeSantis and Putnam. \n \n During a Fox News-sponsored debate in June, DeSantis played up Trump\u2019s backing of his campaign, expressing doubt that Putnam adequately supported Trump. \u201cI am proud to have the endorsement of President Trump in this race,\u201d DeSantis said. \n \n DeSantis, 39, is an Iraq War veteran and decorated military lawyer who has served in the U.S. House since 2013. He is a graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School. \n \n Putnam, 44, also played up his support for Trump, but emphasized, \u201cI am focused on Florida.\u201d \n \n As for the Senate race, Republicans are hoping Scott could flip the seat in a battle with Nelson, one of the Democratic Party\u2019s most vulnerable incumbents. \n \n Trump narrowly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in Florida in the 2016 presidential race by less than 2 percentage points. \n \n It was a good night for incumbents in House races in Florida, as Republican Carlos Curbelo and Democrat Stephanie Murphy were among those who beat back primary challengers. \n \n National Democrats have eyed Curbelo's 26th congressional district as a potential pickup target, in large part because it voted heavily for Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. But with almost all precincts reporting, approximately 2,500 more people had turned out to vote in the GOP primary than in the Democratic primary. \n \n Curbelo garnered 84 percent of the vote against primary opponent Souraya Faas, who described Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad as \"heroes\" and claimed chemical attacks in Syria's civil war were \"staged.\" \n \n In November, Curbelo will face Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, a former associate dean at the Florida International University Medical School and Democratic candidate for state Senate. \n \n Murphy, who unseated GOP incumbent John Mica in 2016, easily defeated a primary challenge in the 7th District from Chardo Richardson, who was backed by Ocasio-Cortez. She will face Florida state Rep. Mike Miller in November's general election. \n \n Fox News\u2019 Samuel Chamberlain, Kaitlyn Schallhorn, Mike Arroyo and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "document": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Kinshasa, pictured in 1955, was at the centre of the pandemic, scientists say \n \n The origin of the Aids pandemic has been traced to the 1920s in the city of Kinshasa, in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, scientists say. \n \n An international team of scientists say a \"perfect storm\" of population growth, sex and railways allowed HIV to spread. \n \n A feat of viral archaeology was used to find the pandemic's origin, the team report in the journal Science. \n \n They used archived samples of HIV's genetic code to trace its source, with evidence pointing to 1920s Kinshasa. \n \n Their report says a roaring sex trade, rapid population growth and unsterilised needles used in health clinics probably spread the virus. \n \n Meanwhile Belgium-backed railways had one million people flowing through the city each year, taking the virus to neighbouring regions. \n \n Experts said it was a fascinating insight into the start of the pandemic. \n \n HIV came to global attention in the 1980s and has infected nearly 75 million people. \n \n It has a much longer history in Africa, but where the pandemic started has remained the source of considerable debate. \n \n Family affair \n \n A team at the University of Oxford and the University of Leuven, in Belgium, tried to reconstruct HIV's \"family tree\" and find out where its oldest ancestors came from. \n \n The research group analysed mutations in HIV's genetic code. \n \n \"You can see the footprints of history in today's genomes, it has left a record, a mutation mark in the HIV genome that can't be eradicated,\" Prof Oliver Pybus from the University of Oxford told the BBC. \n \n By reading those mutational marks, the research team rebuilt the family tree and traced its roots. \n \n Image copyright SPL \n \n HIV is a mutated version of a chimpanzee virus, known as simian immunodeficiency virus, which probably made the species-jump through contact with infected blood while handling bush meat. \n \n The virus made the jump on multiple occasions. One event led to HIV-1 subgroup O which affects tens of thousands in Cameroon. \n \n Yet only one cross-species jump, HIV-1 subgroup M, went on to infect millions of people across every country in the world. \n \n The answer to why this happened lies in the era of black and white film and the tail-end of the European empires. \n \n In the 1920s, Kinshasa (called Leopoldville until 1966) was part of the Belgian Congo. \n \n Prof Oliver Pybus said: \"It was a very large and very rapidly growing area and colonial medical records show there was a high incidence of various sexually transmitted diseases.\" \n \n Sex and railways \n \n Large numbers of male labourers were drawn to the city, distorting the gender balance until men outnumbered women two to one, eventually leading to a roaring sex trade. \n \n Prof Pybus added: \"There are two aspects of infrastructure that could have helped. \n \n \"Public health campaigns to treat people for various infectious diseases with injections seem a plausible route [for spreading the virus]. \n \n \"The second really interesting aspect is the transport networks that enabled people to move round a huge country.\" \n \n Around one million people were using Kinshasa's railways by the end of the 1940s. \n \n The virus spread, with neighbouring Brazzaville and the mining province, Katanga, rapidly hit. \n \n Those \"perfect storm\" conditions lasted just a few decades in Kinshasa, but by the time they ended the virus was already starting to spread around the world. \n \n Image copyright SPL Image caption The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attacks the immune system \n \n Prof Jonathan Ball, from the University of Nottingham, told the BBC: \"It's a fascinating insight into the early phases of the HIV-1 pandemic. \n \n \"It's the usual suspects that are most likely to have helped the virus get a foothold in humans - travel, population increases and human practices such as unsafe healthcare interventions and prostitution. \n \n \"Perhaps the most contentious suggestion is that the spread of the M-group viruses had more to do with the conditions being right than it had to do with these viruses being better adapted for transmission and growth in humans. I'm sure this suggestion will prompt interesting and lively debate within the field.\" \n \n Dr Andrew Freedman, a reader in infectious diseases at Cardiff University, said: \"It does seem an interesting study demonstrating very elegantly how HIV spread in the Congo region long before the Aids epidemic was recognised in the early 80s. \n \n \"It was already known that HIV in humans arose by cross species transmission from chimpanzees in that region of Africa, but this study maps in great detail the spread of the virus from Kinshasa, it was fascinating to read.\" ||||| A new, sophisticated analysis of hundreds of genetic sequences of HIV from different time points and locations adds fascinating insights to the origin of the AIDS epidemic. The study, which appears in this issue of Science (see p. 56), confirms earlier analyses that an HIV-infected person came to what today is Kinshasa around 1920, but it then shows for the first time how the virus went from there to two cities in the southeastern portion of the country, likely aided by the extensive rail system that then existed. The researchers also note that 13 documented cases exist of different simian viruses jumping from chimpanzees, gorillas, and monkeys into humans, but only one\u2014known has HIV-1 group M\u2014sparked a global epidemic. They show that group M and another strain, group O, expanded at the same rate until about 1960, but then group M nearly tripled its rate of spread. Possible reasons include public health campaigns that had contaminated needles and an increase in the number of clients of sex workers. ||||| LONDON Bustling transport networks, migrant labor and changes to the sex trade in early 20th-century Congo created a \"perfect storm\" that gave rise to an HIV pandemic that has now infected 75 million people worldwide, researchers said on Thursday. \n \n In an analysis of the genetic history of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, the scientists said the global pandemic almost certainly began its global spread in the 1920s in Kinshasa in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). \n \n Here, a confluence of factors including urban growth, extensive railway links during Belgian colonial rule and changes in sexual behavior combined to see HIV emerge in Congo's capital and spread across the globe. \n \n Oliver Pybus, a professor at Oxford University's zoology department who co-led the research, said that until now most studies have taken a piecemeal approach to HIV's genetic history and looked only at certain HIV genomes in particular locations. \n \n \"For the first time, we have analyzed all the available evidence using the latest phylogeographic techniques, which enable us to statistically estimate where a virus comes from,\" he said. \"This means we can say with a high degree of certainty where and when the HIV pandemic originated.\" \n \n United Nations AIDS agency (UNAIDS) data show that more than 35 million people worldwide are currently infected with HIV, and some 1.5 million people died of AIDS-related illness in 2013. \n \n Since the HIV/AIDS pandemic began, it has killed up to 40 million people worldwide. \n \n The disease is spread in blood, semen and breast milk. No cure exists, but AIDS can be kept at bay for many years in people with HIV who take cocktails of antiretroviral drugs. \n \n Various strains of HIV are known to have been transmitted from primates and apes to humans at least 13 times in history, but only one of those transmissions - of a strain known as HIV-1 Group M - led to the current human pandemic. \n \n Pybus said the key questions centered on how this happened. \n \n \"Why did most of (the HIV strains) die out, and why did some of them -- like HIV-2 -- go on to generate local epidemics in Africa, and why did only one go to become a global pandemic?\" he said in a telephone interview. \n \n \"To answer that, we needed to try to reconstruct the spread through space and time of the global pandemic strain.\" \n \n Pybus and an international team of researchers analyzed HIV-1 group M sequences from a major HIV sequence database and then combining these analyses with spatial and epidemiological data. Their study will be published in the journal \"Science\" on Thursday. \n \n Philippe Lemey, a professor at Belgium's University of Leuven who worked on the study, explained that genetic analysis had helped establish the time and place of the pandemic's origins. The team then compared that with historical data \"and it became evident that the early spread of HIV-1 from Kinshasa to other population centers followed predictable patterns.\" \n \n A key factor, the analysis suggests, was the DRC's transport networks, particularly its railways, which made Kinshasa one of the best-connected of all central African cities. \n \n \"Data from colonial archives tells us that by the end of 1940s over one million people were traveling through Kinshasa on the railways each year,\" said Nuno Faria of Oxford University, who also worked on the team. \n \n He said the genetic data showed that HIV rapidly spread across the DRC -- a country the size of Western Europe -- traveling with people along railways and waterways to reach Mbuji-Mayi and Lubumbashi in the extreme south and Kisangani in the far north between the end of the 1930s and early 1950s. \n \n The team's findings also suggest that along with transport, social changes such as the changing behavior of sex workers and public health initiatives against other diseases that led to the unsafe use of needles may have contributed to turning HIV into a full-blown epidemic. \n \n \"We think it is likely that the social changes around the independence in 1960 saw the virus break out from small groups of infected people to infect the wider population and eventually the world,\" said Faria. \n \n (Reporting by Kate Kelland) ||||| A \u201cperfect storm\u201d of urban change that began in 1920s Kinshasa led to the catastrophic spread of HIV across Africa and into the wider world, according to scientists who used genetic sequencing and historical records to trace the origins of the pandemic. \n \n Though the virus probably crossed from chimpanzees to humans in southern Cameroon years earlier, HIV remained a regional infection until it entered the capital of what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \n \n From the 1920s until 1960, the pandemic HIV strain \u2013 there were others that fizzled out \u2013 spread from Kinshasa, crossed borders to other nations, and ultimately landed on distant continents. It has infected nearly 75 million people worldwide to date. \n \n When the virus arrived, Kinshasa was bustling. It was the largest and fastest growing city in the region with transport links reaching up and down the country. The busy Congo river curved north and east to Kisangani more than 600 miles away. The railway carried scores of workers southeast to Katanga, a mining province reliant on immigrant labour, and on to Lubumbashi more than 900 miles away. \n \n Records show that by the 1940s, more than a million people a year passed through Kinshasa on the railways alone. By 1960, the rate of new pandemic HIV infections outpaced the growth of the regional population, according to research published in Science. \n \n While boats and trains spread the virus far, other factors played their part. Records suggest Kinshasa had a relatively high proportion of men and a consequent demand for sex workers. Some doctors may have unwittingly spread the virus further, through unsterilised jabs at sexual health clinics. \n \n An international team of scientists led by the universities of Oxford in Britain and Leuven in Belgium reconstructed the history of the HIV pandemic using historical records and DNA samples of the virus dating back to the late 1950s. The DNA allowed them to draw up a family tree of the virus that traced its ancestry through time and space. Using statistical models they could push farther back than the 1950s and locate the origin of the pandemic in 1920s Kinshasa. \n \n People with HIV in central Africa at the time did not have specific symptoms that would have been written down in their medical records. The virus causes the immune system to collapse, leaving people open to all manner of infections. \u201cFor an epidemic like HIV where we\u2019re trying to track back to before it was even discovered, genetics is the only source of information we have,\u201d said Oliver Pybus, an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University and senior author on the study. \n \n The genetic data suggests that pandemic HIV spread rapidly through the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a country the size of western Europe. From the late 1930s to the early 1950s, the virus spread by rail and river to Mbuji-Mayi and Lubumbashi in the south and Kisangani in the north. There the virus took hold and formed secondary reservoirs from where it spread to countries in southern and eastern Africa. \n \n At first, HIV was an infection confined to specific groups of people. But the virus seemed to break out into the general population and spread around the world after what was then known as the Republic of the Congo achieved independence in 1960. \n \n \u201cParts of the story can only be suggestive. Without a time machine it\u2019s very difficult to prove causality. But we can be fairly sure we have the time and place where this happened,\u201d Pybus said. \u201cIt seems a combination of factors in Kinshasa in the early 20th century created a perfect storm for the emergence of HIV, leading to a generalised epidemic with unstoppable momentum that unrolled across sub-Saharan Africa.\u201d \n \n Different strains of HIV have almost certainly jumped from apes to humans \u2013 through hunting or handling bushmeat \u2013 scores of times throughout history. Only a dozen or so incidents have left their traces in the DNA of HIV strains around today. Some outbreaks infected hundreds of thousands of people in Africa but went no further. Only one, known as HIV-1 group M, went pandemic. \n \n \u201cWe all want to know how this happened, how we got here,\u201d said Pybus. \u201cWe wanted to answer the question: why did this one turn into a pandemic?\u201d",

    "document": "A wild turkey is released from a plane flying over Crooked Creek during the 72nd annual Turkey Trot in Yellville, Arkansas, Oct. 14, 2017. An investigation by the FAA into the event released their report in November 2017 saying they found no violations. \n \n Domestic turkeys can't fly \u2014 but that hasn't stopped people in a small town in Arkansas from dropping the birds from small planes at an annual festival event that has drawn opposition from animal-rights activists. \n \n While turkeys can't flap their wings and soar as many other birds can, they can slow their falls somewhat, Michael Habib, a professor of anatomy at the University of Southern California, told Live Science. \"A lot of flightless birds have wings that can produce lift; it's just not enough to fly,\" said Habib, who studies the evolution of flight in birds. \n \n The festival is the annual Turkey Trot in Yellville. For the past 50 years during the festival, a local pilot has flown a plane and dropped domestic turkeys from a height of about 500 feet (150 meters) over local fields, according to the Huffington Post. [10 Weird Facts About Turkeys] \n \n The problem for the domestic turkeys is that, while they can slow a fall, they can't do it forever \u2014 it depends on how long they can keep flapping their wings. Habib noted that turkeys are very powerful for short periods, just like human sprinters. However, they can't keep up that activity for long. So, during the first part of the descent at least, the turkeys likely flap their wings wildly, and they \"fly\" similarly to their wild cousins. \n \n According to the \"Ask the Van\" site at the University of Illinois physics department, when birds fly, their wings push air down and generate thrust, pushing the bird up. And as the wings come up, they bend and push less air because they aren't spread out anymore. That's what allows the average flying bird to keep itself up and, just as importantly, generate some forward motion. The forward motion creates lift, because as air flows over the bird, the layer of air above it is less dense than that below, and the bird rides on the more-dense layer. This is also why some bird species can soar, like eagles and vultures. Given enough forward thrust, a bird can glide and \"coast\" along, because the shape of the wing creates an airflow that is less dense on top of it, just like an airplane's wing. The birds that do this really well like albatrosses have long wingspans and small bodies. \n \n But domestic turkeys are so heavy relative to their wing area that they can't really do either powered flight or gliding well, Habib said. The combined upward thrust and lift simply isn't enough to overcome the bird's weight. [Amazing Physics: How 245 People Jumped Off a Bridge at Once \u2014 and Survived] \n \n This is why, as reported by Arkansas Online, out of a dozen turkeys dropped at the 2016 event, two died on impact. The turkeys can't really glide well, given their shape and weight, Habib said. Even though turkey wings can create a little bit of lift, they don't have the optimal shape to do so, and their bodies are too heavy for it to work, according to Habib. \n \n Other birds have even less ability to slow falls in this way. \"Ostriches wouldn't have any more success than you or I would,\" he said. That's because their wings are simply too small relative to their body size to generate any significant lift at all, he said. \n \n Domestic turkeys can't fly, but wild turkeys can, Habib said. Like other birds in their order, called Galliformes, wild turkeys just can't fly for long \u2014 just long enough to get up into a tree or out of danger. \n \n Some young birds in this order \u2014 which includes chickens, geese and peacocks \u2014 sometimes use their wings to help them climb up trees or inclines. When they need to get down, they use their wings to break their fall. This happens a lot with a bird called the chukar, which is native to Eurasia. The altitude they can reach \u2014 limited by trees and small cliffs \u2014 is nowhere near the altitude the turkeys are dropped from at the Turkey Trot. \n \n This flight ability (or inability) can be seen in the \"color\" of the birds' meat. Habib noted that the metabolism of the muscles in their legs and wings are one of the reasons the meat is light or dark. Dark meat \u2014 in the legs, for example \u2014 has muscle that contains myoglobin, an oxygen-carrying molecule that allows them to work efficiently for longer periods. When it cooks, it becomes darker. \n \n White meat is \"fast-twitch\" muscle that doesn't use as much oxygen because it isn't designed to work for long, but it's powerful. The breast (which powers the wings) is fast-twitch muscle, and it's why the breast meat is lighter in color. Myoglobin is why long-distance flyers, like ducks, have dark meat in the breast that looks more like steak. That powerful, fast-twitch muscle explains why a relatively heavy bird \u2014 the wild turkey \u2014 can fly but tires quickly, Habib said. \n \n Flightlessness can be bred in birds; that's what happened with domestic turkeys and chickens. But it can also appear in birds that live without any pressure from predators because there's no reason to have escapist skills. The kakapo (in the parrot family) and the dodo, which was related to pigeons, became flightless in that way. Habib noted that, in both cases, there were few ground-level predators on these animals' island habitats. Kakapos are native to New Zealand and were driven to near extinction when humans introduced rats and cats to the area. Dodos, which lived on Mauritius, are thought to have been killed by humans for food, but they also became victims of the rats that humans introduced. The last dodos died in the 17th century. \n \n But regardless of turkeys' abilities, it's not good for them to be dropped. \"It's really unethical,\" Habib said. \n \n Originally published on Live Science. ||||| Heavy-metal rocker and animal-welfare activist Tommy Lee has called for an end to the chuckwagon races in Calgary, Alberta, and the running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain. \n \n This story is only available from the Arkansas Online archives.

Some of the turkeys are dropped from a plane, while others were tossed from the top of the Marion County Courthouse. \n \n John, Ringo, George and Paul were rescued by Farm Sanctuary and brought to the group\u2019s shelter in upstate New York. George and Paul are still recovering from their injuries. \n \n Poster said she had never heard of the turkey drop. \u201cIt\u2019s a crazy world,\u201d she said, as John and Ringo got acclimated to their new home at Poster\u2019s Southport farm. \u201cI\u2019ve always had turkeys. I love them.\u201d \n \n There are about 100 animals at the 17-acre farm, Poster said, if you count the chickens. There are 30 rabbits, goats, pigs, Clydesdale horses, a cow, some roosters and a peacock. And now, two turkeys. \n \n The two were delivered by Susie Coston, from Farm Sanctuary. She said PETA had a group of activists on the ground during the turkey drop and were able to convince the people who captured them to turn them over. \n \n \u201cThey look very happy,\u201d Coston said. \u201cThese two weren\u2019t as badly injured.\u201d \n \n Ringo, she said, was a Black Special, while John appeared to be a Narragansett, both of which are heritage breeds, and not wild turkeys. Heritage breeds, she said, are slower to grow, and don\u2019t get as big as the industrial broad-breasted turkeys most are familiar with. \n \n Poster said turkeys live about five or six years, usually getting too big for their legs. \n \n This is not the first time Poster has offered shelter to rescued turkeys. In 2010, she welcomed Mordecai and Fiona, two Bourbon reds, who came from an organic farm. The Farm Sanctuary each year runs an Adopt a Turkey program, and its Turkey Express brings the rescued birds to their new homes. Poster has been adopting rescued turkeys since 1996. \n \n While wild turkeys can fly, it is usually just from tree to tree. Domesticated turkeys can only fly short distances. \n \n The turkey drop is held the same weekend as the Yellville Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Turkey Trot, a festival to highlight the state\u2019s spot as one of the country\u2019s top turkey-producing states. Activities include a road race, music, dancing and a pageant. According to an Associated Press story, the chamber stopped the turkey drop in 1989, but the tradition was continued by local pilots. Dropping the turkeys from a plane is apparently not in violation of FAA rules, so long as they don\u2019t cause damage to people or property. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Photo: Wallace Kirkland/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images Image 1 of / 8 Caption Close Image 1 of 8 | 1953 Yellville, Arkansas Turkey Trot Turkey toss starts as first bird is tossed from low flying plane in Yellville, Arkansas in 1952.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 No matter how busy the holiday travel season, you're pretty much guaranteed to have a smoother flight than the unfortunate turkeys involved in Arkansas' Turkey Trot. The annual October festival in Yellville sees turkeys hurled from buildings and a plane flying 500 feet above the ground. Disturbed? You're not alone. Tommy Lee is among those to bash the \"sick\" tradition, reports Arkansas Online. Live Science explains the uproar: Domestic turkeys are bred for flightlessness, their bodies too heavy for their wings to get them off the ground. While their wings can slow a descent, there's no guarantee domestic turkeys will survive falls from great heights. The same is true of wild turkeys, which can only fly short distances. Indeed, two turkeys dropped from a plane last year died on impact. At least four turkeys dropped this year were found injured and bleeding, though they've since found refuge at a New York shelter, where they were named John, Ringo, George, and Paul, per the Fairfield Citizen. The town of Yellville technically stopped throwing turkeys in 1989\u2014continuing the Turkey Trot festival started in 1946 with a dance, race, and parade\u2014but local pilots continue to throw turkeys, per the Citizen and Baxter Bulletin. Despite animal activists' appeals, the FAA says it doesn't have the authority to intervene. \"FAA regulations do not specifically prohibit dropping live animals from aircraft, possibly because the authors of the regulation never anticipated that an explicit prohibition would be necessary,\" a rep tells the Huffington Post, adding, \"This does not mean we endorse the practice.\"",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Every year for the past 50 years, a local pilot has flown a plane over Yellville, Ark., and dropped turkeys from it as part of the annual Turkey Trot festival. But while turkeys can slow a fall by flapping their wings, they can't do it forever, Michael Habib, a professor of anatomy at the University of Southern California, tells Live Science. That's because, like other birds, they can't fly long enough to keep up that lift. \"A lot of flightless birds have wings that can produce lift; it's just not enough to fly,\" Habib says. Domestic turkeys are so heavy relative to their wings area that they can't do either powered flight or gliding well, he adds. That's why two of the dozen turkeys dropped at last year's festival died on impact. Habib says the metabolism of the muscles in the legs and wings is one of the reasons the meat is light or dark. White meat is \"fast-twitch\" muscle that doesn't use as much oxygen because it isn't designed to work for long, but it's powerful. The breast (which powers the wings) is fast-twitch muscle, and it's why the breast meat is lighter in color. Other birds have even less ability to slow falls in this way.",

    "document": "It\u2019s difficult for many of us to imagine a world without the benefits of technology. As mobile providers revolutionize our daily lives with each new gadget and companies tout the simplicity of e-commerce and social networking, it\u2019s all too easy to forget that this technology is simply not accessible for millions of Americans, especially seniors. \n \n The transformative power of technology is real, but so is the digital divide. \n \n Across the country, more than 25 percent of Americans lack Internet access, and seniors are especially likely to be without technology. More than 50 percent of Americans over age 65 lack Internet access, while nearly half of them do not even own a computer. \n \n Seniors make up the lion\u2019s share of the more than 30 million households \u2014 a quarter of our population \u2014 that are being left behind while the rest of America goes online. While great strides are being made to deliver technology to more Americans, we are not there yet. \n \n Yet despite this deep digital divide, government agencies are increasingly choosing to eliminate traditional access to paper-based services and information \u2014 leaving millions of Americans, especially seniors, behind. \n \n Federal agencies, from the Treasury to the Social Security Administration, are now forcing Americans \u2014 even those who lack Internet and even computer access \u2014 to go online to interact with their government. And many of these decisions to go paperless primarily affect seniors, who are nearly twice as likely to be without Internet access. \n \n The Treasury, for example, ambitiously set a March 2013 deadline to completely phase out paper federal benefits checks. For two years leading up to the deadline, the agency demanded that Social Security beneficiaries either switch to direct deposit or opt into electronic debit cards, which carry steep fees. The March deadline came and went, however, with 5 million beneficiaries \u2014 mostly elderly Americans \u2014 refusing to give up paper checks. \n \n Many of these seniors and other federal beneficiaries are uncomfortable with electronic debit cards or the direct-deposit process, or simply do not have a bank account. Others have concerns about privacy and growing cybersecurity threats. They are not ready or equipped for digital banking or online interaction, and our government should not force them. \n \n Benefits checks aren\u2019t the only paper-based services being eradicated. The Social Security Administration has also eliminated the mailing of annual earnings statements, which offered all workers ages 25-60 a chance to double-check the government\u2019s math and plan for retirement. Now these statements are only accessible online, meaning that low-income earners who most need these earnings statements are unlikely to ever get a copy. \n \n The Treasury also phased out paper savings bonds, turning an important American tradition into just another click of the mouse. The move also makes it difficult for seniors, who were once the primary buyers of savings bonds, to purchase them. \n \n Although the government\u2019s rush to go paperless clearly penalizes seniors and other Americans without access to technology, the general public also disagrees with these actions. \n \n According to a new national poll by the advocacy group Consumers for Paper Options, 73 percent of American adults believe it is wrong to expect Americans to interact with government agencies online. \n \n Additionally, 85 percent said federal decisions to restrict paper-based services should be overseen by Congress. Right now, these decisions are made behind closed doors \u2014 often without congressional oversight or public comment. \n \n These survey respondents \u2014 all of whom have Internet access \u2014 also recognized the negative consequences for seniors and others caught in the digital divide. Nearly 90 percent of respondents said the government\u2019s shift to paperless services disadvantages elderly, disabled, low-income and poorly educated Americans. \n \n The government\u2019s rush to go paperless is disenfranchising millions of seniors and other vulnerable Americans and making the digital divide even deeper. \n \n The push to make these changes while millions of seniors remain uncomfortable with technology \u2014 and even more cannot even access it \u2014 should stop. Government agencies shouldn\u2019t be rushing to make these changes, and Congress should have proper oversight of such significant shifts in policy that negatively affect our seniors and all Americans. \n \n We call on our fellow members of Congress to help us ensure that federal agencies embrace the benefits of a digital world without discriminating against Americans who lack access to technology or the skills to use them. \n \n Our job is to serve the American people. That means maintaining and protecting access for all. \n \n Rep. Sean P. Duffy is a Republican from Wisconsin; Rep. Michael H. Michaud is a Democrat from Maine. ||||| Language tucked into last month\u2019s budget deal requires the government to plan for resuming paper delivery of annual Social Security earnings statements to some of the nation\u2019s 150 million future retirees. (Matt Rourke/AP) \n \n As the Obama administration pushes to do more business over the Internet, finally seeking to close the technology gap with the private sector, the digital makeover is running into a dogged opponent called Consumers for Paper Options. \n \n The group is working the halls of Congress in closed-door meetings, underwriting research favorable to its position and mounting a news media campaign in an effort to preserve Washington as the capital of paper \u2014 and slow the move away from printed checks, forms and other paper communication. \n \n The lobbying group has had some recent victories, including language tucked into last month\u2019s budget deal that requires the government to plan for resuming paper delivery of annual Social Security earnings statements to some of the nation\u2019s 150 million future retirees. And it\u2019s been claiming these wins in the name of the elderly and low-income Americans the Internet has left behind. \n \n Except Consumers for Paper Options is a creation of the paper industry. \n \n The group \u2014 which bills itself as \u201ca coalition of individuals and organizations advocating for access to paper-based services and information\u201d \u2014 was set up by the Envelope Manufacturers Association (EMA), officials from both organizations said. It receives financial backing from the paper industry\u2019s largest trade group, several of North America\u2019s biggest paper manufacturers and EMA, according to documents and interviews with company and trade association officials. The EMA and other paper companies are also pushing for Congress to pass legislation to help stabilize the Postal Service. \n \n Consumers for Paper Options is led by a veteran advocate for the industry\u2019s interests on Capitol Hill. His previous posts include head of federal government relations for International Paper, the largest pulp and paper company in the world, and treasurer of its PAC. \n \n \u201cThe glitzy new thing is to be pro-technology,\u201d said John Runyan, Consumers for Paper Options\u2019 executive director. \u201cBut a lot of government agencies are saying, \ufffd?We\u2019re going electronic and the heck with it.\u2019 \u201d \n \n With federal budgets under fire in Congress, the government\u2019s move to the Internet has gained pace. An electronic payment, for instance, costs the government only 9 cents to process, compared with $1.25 for a paper check, the Treasury Department says. \n \n At Treasury, which last year suspended most paper mailings for all but the very aged and those with \u201cmental impairments,\u201d officials estimate the shift will save $1 billion over 10 years. The move by the Social Security Administration in 2011 to stop mailing paper earnings statements to 150 million Americans is saving $72 million a year. \n \n For the paper industry, the stakes are high. The digital age has ravaged sales of envelopes, office paper, catalogues and pulp products, with industry analysts saying that demand for paper products dropped 5 percent on average in each of the past five years. Mills have closed, and thousands of employees have been laid off. \n \n So Consumers for Paper Options and industry officials have raised the banner of the digital divide, warning that putting government services online is creating hurdles for many Americans. \n \n Runyan said his group is not against technology but rather is for choice: \u201cIf there are Americans who can\u2019t use an iPhone to navigate the Internet, there ought to be an option for them.\u201d \n \n When asked whether Consumers for Paper Options represents consumers or the industry, Runyan said the point is that a quarter of Americans do not have Internet access. He added that its efforts have won support from ordinary Americans. \n \n Maynard Benjamin, president of the EMA, said the \u201cconsumers\u201d in the group\u2019s name are \u201ceverybody\u2019s mother and father and sister who care about the way government policy develops.\u201d \n \n While some traditional consumer groups have also asked the government to make accommodations for the elderly and others who do not use the Internet, it is Runyan\u2019s organization that has been most active on the issue. \n \n The group\u2019s lobbyists have been meeting with members of Congress and their staffs, concentrating in particular on those from paper-producing states and districts with large elderly populations. Runyan and Benjamin said the goal is to \u201ceducate\u201d lawmakers about what advocates describe as the government\u2019s willy-nilly rush to digitize without proper oversight. \n \n Runyan met with Rep. Susan A. Davis (D-Calif.) and pressed her to get language put into the budget bill requiring the Social Security Administration to develop a plan to restore the mailing of paper earnings statements, said Runyan and the lawmaker\u2019s staff. \n \n Late last year, Consumers for Paper Options scored another victory when Rep. Michael H. Michaud (D-Maine), working with the American Forest and Paper Association, used his influence to have language removed from a pharmaceutical bill that would have ended the practice of printing prescription information and inserting it into drug packages, instead requiring that it be posted online. The Food and Drug Administration has been pressing for the change, which the agency says would save money and ensure the information is up to date. \n \n But Michaud warned that the change would put consumers at risk. \n \n His argument about the dangers of the \u201crush to go paperless\u201d was highlighted in a December op-ed article in Roll Call signed by Michaud and Rep. Sean P. Duffy (R-Wis.), which said the shift was \u201cdisenfranchising millions of seniors and other vulnerable Americans and making the digital divide even deeper.\u201d Consumers for Paper Options helped craft the piece and got it placed in Roll Call, according to officials familiar with the article. \n \n The group has conducted several studies of consumer preferences, Runyan said, including a poll last year that reportedly found that 73 percent of American adults do not think they should be required to interact with the government online. Those research findings have been repeatedly cited in newspapers and trade publications across the country and attributed to Consumers for Paper Options. In very few instances did they disclose that the group was set up by the paper industry. \n \n Consumers for Paper Options started in 2010 as the Senate was debating the Dodd-Frank Act, which created new regulations for the financial industry. A little-noticed proposal would have required banks and credit-card companies to put all statements online. That provision was never enacted. \n \n But the Obama administration had other plans to reduce paper services. The government, for instance, was looking to make use of direct deposit or prepaid debit cards for monthly checks for veterans, federal retirees, disabled Americans and 66 million retirees on Social Security. IRS tax forms and other government \u201cpaperwork\u201d were also going online. \n \n The paper industry was growing alarmed. Consumers for Paper Options stepped up its fundraising and outreach in Washington, arguing, for instance, that using debit cards would saddle the poor with high fees and that electronic tax refunds and checks would lead to stolen identities. \n \n \u201cI wish we had launched this effort 10 years ago,\u201d said Thomas Howard, vice president of government relations for Domtar, one of North America\u2019s largest paper manufacturers and a financial backer of Consumers for Paper Options. \u201cBut we\u2019re on top of things now. Government agencies are in effect slamming citizens by determining how they will receive vital information.\u201d \n \n In the past year alone, 22 of the largest federal agencies have reduced their spending on paper by about 7 percent, to $64 million a year, according to data from the General Services Administration. With the trend likely to continue, Duffy and Michaud have introduced a resolution calling for government action to ensure that people be provided with \u201cpaper-based information\u201d along with electronic. The measure is awaiting a hearing. \n \n While government purchases of paper are a small share of overall demand, Runyan said that restoring the use of paper in federal transactions could set a precedent for the private sector, where the economic threat of financial firms and retailers going all-digital is far greater. \n \n He says his group has enlisted many partners in the fight, including Consumer Action and the Gray Panthers, an advocacy group that focuses in part on issues affecting senior citizens. The organizations are not official members but like-minded groups in an \u201cadvocacy effort that\u2019s trying to leverage resources. . . . We\u2019re not just advocating on behalf of the industry,\u201d Runyan said. \n \n Officials from several traditional consumer groups said they had held discussions with Consumers for Paper Options about their shared concerns and ways that it could help them, for instance by conducting research. \n \n Sally Greenberg, executive director of the National Consumers League, said she\u2019s a \u201cbig believer in getting a piece of paper sent to you at least once a year\u201d and isn\u2019t opposed to teaming up with others on the same side of the issue. But along with other advocates who held discussions with Consumers for Paper Options, she still wasn\u2019t sure whom that group represents. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s behind them,\u201d she said. \n \n Alice Crites contributed to this report.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 In 2011, the Social Security Administration put the kibosh on mailing paper statements to 150 million future retirees, at an annual cost savings of $72 million. But last month's budget contained language that forces the government to plan for restarting these paper mailings. Ridiculous? Not according to a group called Consumers for Paper Options, which lobbied for that change and has since 2010 been \"advocating for access to paper-based services and information,\" as the group puts it. But though the group says it's a \"coalition of individuals and organizations,\" it's actually a product of the paper industry, the Washington Post reports: It was established by the Envelope Manufacturers Association and gets funding from the top paper-industry trade group. The Treasury expects to save $1 billion over a decade following its 2013 move to largely paperless communications, noting that processing a paper check costs $1.25, which is $1.16 cents more than the cost of an electronic payment. (It hasn't stopped paper mailings to the elderly and people with \"mental impairments,\" the Post notes.) But \"if there are Americans who can't use an iPhone to navigate the Internet, there ought to be an option for them,\" says a rep for Consumers for Paper Options, noting that a quarter of the US lacks Internet access. He also cites a study that says 73% of adults don't believe they should have to deal with the government online. That study was run by the group. A recent op-ed in Roll Call signed by a pair of congressmen also pushed for paper; it turns out Consumers for Paper Options was involved in that piece, too. Who are the \"consumers\"? \"Everybody\u2019s mother and father and sister who care about the way government policy develops,\" says an industry leader.",

During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy.\" \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n The announcement comes after the New York Post reported on Sunday night about Weiner's latest sexually explicit messages with another woman. Weiner, who has been married to Abedin since July 2010, resigned from Congress in 2011 after mistakenly tweeting an explicit image of himself intended as a direct message. \n \n Abedin, who was embarrassed by Weiner's decision to permit filmmakers to document his failed 2013 failed New York City mayoral run, was hoping to end the marriage outside the glare of the mid-campaign cameras. But the new images \u2014 especially the image of Weiner in underwear on a bed next to their young son \u2014 were simply too much to bear, said one Abedin friend. \n \n A person close to Abedin said the couple has been \"estranged\" for about a year and \"essentially\" separated \u2014 although they still share both their Manhattan apartment and parenting duties. Over the past few months, people close to the couple have painted a portrait of a marriage on the verge of collapse, and reporters covering the campaign have noticed in recent weeks that Abedin has often appeared in public without her wedding or engagement rings. \n \n They have, however, made high-profile public appearances together during that time. In May, for instance, the couple attended the celebrity-studded Met Ball and posed for society column photographers together. And in a glossy profile in Vogue magazine earlier this month, Abedin credited her husband\u2019s willingness to function as a \u201cfull-time dad\u201d as part of the support system that allowed her to take on such a demanding role in the campaign. \n \n Abedin, according to two people in her orbit, didn't know the Post story was in the works before heading to the Hamptons for her annual working vacation with the Clintons \u2014 who have been ferociously fundraising \u2014 and Clinton intimates like Cheryl Mills, along with Abedin's own family, including her sister Heba and her son Jordan. Weiner was not invited, they told POLITICO. \n \n \"She wasn't fleeing the media,\" said a person close to the longtime Clinton body woman \u2014 whom the Democratic nominee has likened to a second daughter. \"But it worked out for the best, being surrounded by her family and her friends ... It's a difficult day but she'll get through it.\" \n \n Several other Abedin friends and colleagues expressed similar sentiments: While they were concerned for her well-being over the next few days and weeks, they are happy that Weiner was being given his walking papers. \"Anything that ensures he's no longer around is good news,\" said one fellow Clinton staffer. \n \n And Clinton allies immediately rallied around Abedin. \u201cHuma is like family, not just to Hillary Clinton, but to the \u2026 whole campaign\u201d Jennifer Granholm, vice chair of Clinton\u2019s transition committee said on MSNBC. \u201cShe is like the glue. And I'm sure that the whole campaign is hoping that people respect her privacy and grieve with her over what is happening.\u201d \n \n But some allies are privately expressing concern that Abedin\u2019s high public profile \u2014 she is a near-constant presence by Clinton\u2019s side and has become a celebrity in her own right, with fans even stopping her for selfies \u2014 could enable her personal story to overshadow Clinton\u2019s message in the final 70 days of the campaign. \n \n \u201cIt would be helpful for her to take a step back from the campaign for a while,\u201d said one Clinton ally close to the campaign, \u201cor at least get off the campaign trail and work in Brooklyn. But I doubt that is going to happen.\u201d \n \n Another Clinton ally expressed concern that Abedin would remain a target \u2014 of the media and of Donald Trump \u2014 if she remained in the spotlight. \n \n But campaign aides said there was no indication that Abedin\u2019s personal life will affect her professional role as a key player in Clinton\u2019s traveling inner circle. \u201cThe sentiment has been one thing and one thing only: We only want to do what is in the best interest of Huma,\u201d said a Clinton aide. \n \n In conversations Sunday evening and Monday morning, among a brain trust of about seven staffers and confidantes in Clinton\u2019s inner circle, the idea of Abedin taking a step back for the critical final months of the campaign was never broached, the aide said. \u201cWe are entirely focused on the fact that Huma needs to do what she needs to do, and we\u2019re going to help her.\u201d \n \n Clinton herself, longtime associates said, is likely to return the support and loyalty of one of her longest-serving aides. \u201cShe\u2019s going to want to be supportive of her, and tell her, \u2018whatever you want to do,\u2019\u201d said one Clinton confidante. And Abedin is known among her colleagues as someone who feels most comfortable, and derives most of her power, when in close proximity to the candidate. \n \n But over the past year, she has already been slowly backing off of some of the more quotidian campaign travel days in an effort to shed her \u201cbody woman\u201d persona. She did travel with Clinton for her latest fundraising swing through California, for instance, but served more as a sort of campaign ambassador to celebrities and big donors. And on regular campaign days, she has been working from the office more often than the road. \n \n Abedin, who has fended off Republican attacks for years, has come under renewed scrutiny for her role in handling requests from Bill Clinton aide Doug Band, who peppered the secretary of state\u2019s office with requests for meetings with Clinton Foundation donors, according to recently released emails. The Clinton campaign has dismissed as \u201ccherry-picking\u201d an Associated Press investigation finding that the Democratic nominee met with dozens of foundation donors as secretary. \n \n The future seems uncertain for Weiner, whose Twitter account had vanished Monday morning after the Post's report. And in another sign of the expanding fallout, New York Daily News opinion editor Josh Greenman confirmed to POLITICO that the newspaper will no longer run his column, which it has published since 2014. The local station NY1, where Weiner was a regular paid talking head, also placed him on \"indefinite leave,\" CNN reported. \n \n The former congressman has resurfaced repeatedly in 2016, in part due to the documentary that he said Abedin never consented to doing (a spokeswoman for the filmmaker told The New York Times that everyone had consented to appearing in the film), and in no small measure thanks to Trump, who has also made repeated digs at Clinton for her association with Weiner as Abedin's husband. \n \n On Monday, Trump praised Abedin for \"making a very wise decision,\" though he took a shot at her boss for good measure. \n \n \"I know Anthony Weiner well, and she will be far better off without him,\" the Republican nominee said in a statement. \"I only worry for the country in that Hillary Clinton was careless and negligent in allowing Weiner to have such close proximity to highly classified information. Who knows what he learned and who he told? It's just another example of Hillary Clinton's bad judgment. It is possible that our country and its security have been greatly compromised by this.\" \n \n Trump was more colorful during an interview Monday on KIRO Radio 97.3 FM\u2019s \u201cThe Dori Monson Show.\u201d \n \n \u201cHere\u2019s a guy that what he\u2019s done over the internet is disgusting, and he\u2019s a pervert and just a very sick guy,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a sick puppy, and so, you know, it just happened and it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s actually sad in many ways,\u201d adding that Weiner\u2019s behavior was \u201chard to comprehend.\u201d \n \n Speaking to the Times' Mark Leibovich in an interview published earlier this month, Weiner dodged a pointed question about whether he was still doing the same things that had previously caused trouble to him and those around him. Instead, Weiner used the query as an opportunity to score political points against Trump. \n \n \"I\u2019m not going to go down the path of talking about any of that. But I will say this: There\u2019s no doubt that the Trump phenomenon has led a lot of people to say to me, 'Boy, compared to inviting the Russians to come hack someone\u2019s email, your thing seems almost quaint,'\" Weiner said, referring to Trump's self-described \"sarcastic\" request for the Russians to leak the contents of Clinton's deleted emails. \n \n Trump has shared his thoughts about the disgraced congressman on multiple occasions through his various sexting controversies and failed mayoral comeback bid. \n \n \"Wife Huma wants @RepWeiner to 'pull a @billclinton by giving a tell-all interview.' Unlike Clinton, Anthony is a sick puppy,\" Trump tweeted on July 16, 2012, after writing, \"he's a sexual pervert & they can never be healed. Huma should drop him before it happens again.\" \n \n Asked by a Twitter user in July 2013 what advice he would give Abedin, Trump responded, \"Take off!\" \n \n \"Huma should dump the sicko Weiner. He is a calamity that is bringing her down with him,\" Trump wrote on Sept. 23, 2013. \n \n Months after launching his presidential campaign, Trump suggested that Weiner was a security risk. \n \n \"It came out that Huma Abedin knows all about Hillary\u2019s private illegal emails,\" Trump tweeted on Aug. 31, 2015. \"Huma\u2019s PR husband, Anthony Weiner, will tell the world.\" \n \n Granholm on Monday called Trump's warnings about potentially compromised national secrets \"ridiculous.\" \n \n \"I think that Donald Trump and everyone else should respect the privacy of Huma Abedin who is, as you know, an utterly graceful, wonderful human being who's going through a terrible situation,\" the former Michigan governor said on MSNBC. \"So I say let us respect their privacy, and it's nonsense about classified information.\" \n \n Nolan McCaskill contributed to this report. ||||| By Monday morning, when the Post cover showing Mr. Weiner and his son, Jordan, hit newsstands, Mr. Weiner had left the Hamptons for New York City aware that Ms. Abedin planned to announce their separation, said two people close to the couple who discussed private conversations on the condition of anonymity. \n \n \u201cAfter long and painful consideration and work on my marriage, I have made the decision to separate from my husband,\u201d Ms. Abedin said in a statement. \u201cAnthony and I remain devoted to doing what is best for our son, who is the light of our life. During this difficult time, I ask for respect for our privacy.\u201d \n \n In the latest issue of Vogue, Ms. Abedin portrayed Mr. Weiner as a devoted father and their marriage as a true partnership. \u201cMany working moms feel this way \u2014 there is a lot of guilt,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could do it if I didn\u2019t have the full support system I have, if Anthony wasn\u2019t willing to be, essentially, a full-time dad.\u201d \n \n But the two people close to the couple said Ms. Abedin and Mr. Weiner had been growing apart for some time, with Ms. Abedin often on the campaign trail with Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Weiner at home with Jordan. They said the Post article had not caused a sudden and unexpected rupture to a happy marriage, but rather was the final catalyst for Ms. Abedin to move for a separation. \n \n Campaign officials had braced for new revelations about Mr. Weiner after The Post reported this month that a Republican had baited Mr. Weiner into a flirtatious online chat. Asked by The New York Times this month whether he was still engaging in the behavior that had foiled his political career, Mr. Weiner said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to go down the path of talking about any of that.\u201d \n \n Mrs. Clinton had hoped to ride out the final week of August with limited distractions as she seeks to maintain her solid lead in national polls. On Monday, she attended three fund-raisers in the Hamptons, without Ms. Abedin, and spoke briefly on a conference call with policy experts and medical providers to unveil her proposals on mental health. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make clear mental health is not a personal failing,\u201d Mrs. Clinton said. \n \n Aides said that Ms. Abedin\u2019s marriage was a private matter and that her decision to announce the separation meant the frenetic news cycle would soon move on.",

    "document": "Published on Nov 25, 2008 \n \n Paul Dawson \n \n Food Scientist, Clemson University \n \n \n \n The five-second-rule is a popular belief that if you drop food on the floor and pick it up within five seconds, it won't be too germ laden to eat. It's not true and we've proven it, it's well, bologna. My name is Paul Dawson. I'm a food scientist at the food science and human nutrition department at Clemson University. \n \n \n \n My students and I have researched the five-second-rule and published the results in the Journal of Applied Microbiology. We did this as a creative inquiry project to learn how research is done. That is, research begins with a simple idea or a question, experiment is then set up to test this idea or question, data is collected, and finally a conclusion is drawn based on what the data showed us about that original question. In the case of the five-second-rule we found that bacteria was transferred from tabletops and floors to the food within five seconds, that is the five second rule is not an accurate guide when it comes to eating food that has fallen on the floor. \n \n \n \n My students have done other creative inquiry projects. Weve researched what happens when someone double-dips. You have probably seen it happen; someone dips a chip, takes a bite, and then dips a chip again. We have also researched what happens when someone drinks milk out of the carton. \n \n \n \n Both projects showed that these activities are bad ideas when it comes to healthy eating and food safety. The experiments are not silly but are not only designed to teach students about food science, which is food safety, tasteness and freshness, but also about how research is done and how it affects our daily lives, even if it's about dropping food on the floor. Most of all Clemson's creative inquiry program is about looking deeper in the world around us, learning how to question the facts and assumptions, whether it be in the arts or the sciences. ||||| The controversial \u201cfive-second rule\u201d \u2014 the one that lets us eat dropped food if it\u2019s quickly scooped off the floor \u2014 is a bunch of boloney, according to Clemson University food scientist Paul Dawson, who stirred up the long-debated issue in this month\u2019s National Geographic. \n \n Though previous research has shown we may have up to a minute to rescue certain types of spilled food before it becomes contaminated, Dawson and his students made a strong case for the \u201czero-second rule.\u201d They found that salmonella and other bacteria can live up to four weeks on dry surfaces and be immediately transferred to food. \n \n (Chicago Tribune illustration by Michael Miner) \n \n The zero-tolerance standard, however, conflicts with the findings of two Connecticut College student researchers who sprinkled apple slices and Skittles candies in the college dining hall and snack bar for five, 10, 30 and 60-second intervals. The apple slices picked up bacteria after one minute; nearly five minutes elapsed before the Skittles attracted any. \n \n Then there were the University of Maine undergraduates who concluded that using the five-second-rule could reduce food waste and possibly improve children\u2019s immune systems. \n \n Still, most researchers agree that the critical thing is not time, but location. It\u2019s OK to brush off the bagel that fell from the stroller onto the sidewalk and give it to your screaming child, for example, because the pavement is cleaner than the kitchen floor in terms of the types of germs that cause illnesses, said Dr. Harley Rotbart, a professor of microbiology and pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. \n \n \u201cThe kitchen floor, however, is probably a zero-second zone because the bacteria from uncooked meat and chicken juices are more hazardous than the \u2018soil\u2019 bacteria outside,\u201d said Rotbart. The bathroom floor is another zero-second zone because \u201cit\u2019s a great potential source of bacteria and shorter-lived viruses that can cause gastrointestinal illness if ingested,\u201d said Rotbart, the author of \u201cGerm Proof Your Kids.\u201d \n \n Ultimately, however, most people assess their risk according to how badly they want what has slipped through their fingers and whether anyone else is looking. Women are more likely to eat food that has been on the floor than men, while cookies and candy are much more likely to be picked up and eaten than cauliflower or broccoli, research shows. \n \n Unfortunately, despite the distress it causes, there\u2019s just no rescuing ice cream. \n \n Related content: \n \n The five-second rule is alive and well at Illinois same-day surgery centers, according to Associated Press Medical Writer Carla K. Johnson. \"Medical staff were observed picking up items that had fallen to the floor and behaving as if they weren't contaminated by germs, according to state inspection reports.\" Here's the full story, \"Illinois clinics cited over infection control.\" ||||| Though conventional wisdom says you have three to five seconds before a dropped substance becomes infested with germs, two Connecticut College student researchers have found that we actually have 30 seconds to pick up moist foods and more than a minute to pick up dry foods before they're contaminated with bacteria. \n \n Apparently we have more time than we thought when it comes to retrieving and eating food that has been dropped on the floor, a favorite topic among Julie's Health Club readers. \n \n The students set out to challenge previous research on the topic by Jillian Clarke of Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences, who tested the theory several years ago for a college internship by dropping food items directly onto e-coli contaminated tiles. \n \n \"That's not representative of what really happens,\" said Connecticut College's Molly Goettsche, a cell and molecular biology major. \n \n Trying to simulate everyday life, Goettsche and Nicole Moin dropped apple slices and Skittles candies in the Connecticut College dining hall and snack bar for five, 10, 30 and 60-second intervals. They also tested them after allowing five minutes to elapse and then searched for any rogue bacteria. \n \n The researchers found no bacteria were present on the foods that had remained on the floor for 5, 10 or 30 seconds. The apple slices did pick up bacteria after one minute, however and the Skittles showed a bacterial presence after remaining on the floor for 5 minutes.",

The Jewish Chronicle reports that some of Himmler's diaries were discovered in the 1950s, and hundreds of letters surfaced in Tel Aviv more recently; these \"service diaries\" were reportedly taken by the Red Army, archived in Podolsk near Moscow, and forgotten. Germany's Bild newspaper on Tuesday began serializing the diaries, and the Times of London has details. Himmler began many days with a lengthy massage in an effort to assuage chronic stomach cramps. Hours of meetings would follow (one entry shows 19 policy meetings in a four-hour span); meetings occurred with 1,600 people over the course of the diaries. The Times reports plenty of innocuous moments: looking at the stars and planned phone calls with his daughter Gudrun, identified as \"Puppi.\" But interspersed are execution orders, the purchase of guard dogs for Auschwitz, and movements that sound innocuous but were anything but.

    "document": "We begin with the three words everyone writing about the election must say: Nobody knows anything. Everyone\u2019s guessing. I spent Sunday morning in Washington with journalists and political hands, one of whom said she feels it\u2019s Obama, the rest of whom said they don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s Romney. I think he\u2019s stealing in \u201clike a thief with good tools,\u201d in Walker Percy\u2019s old words. While everyone is looking at the polls and the storm, Romney\u2019s slipping into the presidency. He\u2019s quietly rising, and he\u2019s been rising for a while. \n \n Obama and the storm, it was like a wave that lifted him and then moved on, leaving him where he\u2019d been. Parts of Jersey and New York are a cold Katrina. The exact dimensions of the disaster will become clearer when the election is over. One word: infrastructure. Officials knew the storm was coming and everyone knew it would be bad, but the people of the tristate area were not aware, until now, just how vulnerable to deep damage their physical system was. The people in charge of that system are the politicians. Mayor Bloomberg wanted to have the Marathon, to show New York\u2019s spirit. In Staten Island last week they were bitterly calling it \u201cthe race through the ruins.\u201d There is a disconnect. \n \n But to the election. Who knows what to make of the weighting of the polls and the assumptions as to who will vote? Who knows the depth and breadth of each party\u2019s turnout efforts? Among the wisest words spoken this cycle were by John Dickerson of CBS News and Slate, who said, in a conversation the night before the last presidential debate, that he thought maybe the American people were quietly cooking something up, something we don\u2019t know about. \n \n I think they are and I think it\u2019s this: a Romney win. \n \n Romney\u2019s crowds are building\u201428,000 in Morrisville, Pa., last night; 30,000 in West Chester, Ohio, Friday It isn\u2019t only a triumph of advance planning: People came, they got through security and waited for hours in the cold. His rallies look like rallies now, not enactments. In some new way he\u2019s caught his stride. He looks happy and grateful. His closing speech has been positive, future-looking, sweetly patriotic. His closing ads are sharp\u2014the one about what\u2019s going on at the rallies is moving. \n \n All the vibrations are right. A person who is helping him who is not a longtime Romneyite told me, yesterday: \u201cI joined because I was anti Obama\u2014I\u2019m a patriot, I\u2019ll join up But now I am pro-Romney.\u201d Why? \u201cI\u2019ve spent time with him and I care about him and admire him. He\u2019s a genuinely good man.\u201d Looking at the crowds on TV, hearing them chant \u201cThree more days\u201d and \u201cTwo more days\u201d\u2014it feels like a lot of Republicans have gone from anti-Obama to pro-Romney. \n \n Something old is roaring back. One of the Romney campaign\u2019s surrogates, who appeared at a rally with him the other night, spoke of the intensity and joy of the crowd \u201cI worked the rope line, people wouldn\u2019t let go of my hand.\u201d It startled him. A former political figure who\u2019s been in Ohio told me this morning something is moving with evangelicals, other church-going Protestants and religious Catholics. He said what\u2019s happening with them is quiet, unreported and spreading: They really want Romney now, they\u2019ll go out and vote, the election has taken on a new importance to them. \n \n There is no denying the Republicans have the passion now, the enthusiasm. The Democrats do not. Independents are breaking for Romney. And there\u2019s the thing about the yard signs. In Florida a few weeks ago I saw Romney signs, not Obama ones. From Ohio I hear the same. From tony Northwest Washington, D.C., I hear the same. \n \n Is it possible this whole thing is playing out before our eyes and we\u2019re not really noticing because we\u2019re too busy looking at data on paper instead of what\u2019s in front of us?

A few weeks ago I saw the president and the governor at the Al Smith dinner, and both were beautiful specimens in their white ties and tails, and both worked the dais.

He was distracted, and his smiles seemed forced. He looked like a man who\u2019d just seen some bad internal polling. Romney? Expansive, hilarious, self-spoofing, with a few jokes of finely calibrated meanness that were just perfect for the crowd. He looked like a president.

    "document": "\"Live, from New York, it's Dennis Rodman.\" \n \n Saturday Night Live doesn't often do that well with sports heroes in the hosting gig, so why not a cameo from the antithesis of sports heroes? \n \n During a sort of rambling, pieced together sketch mocking Kim Jong-un (played in the sketch by Bobby Moynihan), former NBA star and current best friend of the North Korean dictator, Dennis Rodman, came to... well, we're not really sure what he came to do. See below. \n \n I'm not really sure what the point of Rodman's appearance is. Is he satirizing his recent standing as a buddy of North Korea's Supreme Leader, pointing out that he's paid to hang out with a dictator? What's the joke here? I wonder if he's in on the joke or not, to be honest. Anyway, he gets a reaction from the crowd and gets to deliver the \"Live, from New York, it's Saturday night!\" line. A very baffling appearance, to say the least. \n \n \n \n \n \n SNL continued on a sports theme a little bit later, with host Melissa McCarthy taking on a more violent version of Rutgers coach Mike Rice. This, however, will be the one that everyone is talking about tomorrow morning, I reckon. ||||| She sang, she danced, she fell, she picked up a punch bowl and drank from it. Melissa McCarthy pulled off stellar physical comedy in hosting \"Saturday Night Live\" a second time. \n \n The \"Mike & Molly\" star is a natural for \"SNL\" because she loves performing. She goes all out to get laughs, not worrying about political correctness. She stoops to conquer, if that's what it takes, and viewers appreciate the no-holds-barred approach. \n \n She had a string of funny sketches that any \"SNL\" host would envy. In a nod to the Rutgers scandal, she was a bullying basketball coach who threw a toaster at a player. She was a fair contestant who promoted her honey-baked ham by dancing with men dressed as pigs. \n \n She was a shameless loan applicant who wanted money to eat pizza. She was a socially inept date who drank from a punch bowl. She spoofed Vanna White by playing a daft letter-turner on a game show. \n \n McCarthy was a bad singer who had the take-anyone judges on \"The Voice\" fighting over her, and \"SNL\" took some well-aimed jabs at the fellow NBC show. \n \n Even the bits without McCarthy seemed better than usual. \"SNL\" opened with a topical sketch ridiculing North Korean leader Jim Jong-Un (Bobby Moynihan), who talked about his sexual prowess. \"Weekend Update\" loaded up on guests: Bar Mitzvah Boy (Melissa Bayer), Charles Barkley (Kenan Thompson) and Drunk Uncle (Moynihan again). Drunk Uncle had help from \"Game of Thrones\" star Peter Dinklage. \n \n But it was McCarthy's show. She fell in her monologue, by design, because of bad shoes. But she soared once again as host because her brand of physical comedy never goes out of style. ||||| All of the elements for a truly terrific \"SNL\" were there -- great host, spirited audience, refreshed cast -- but it wasn't a terrific \"SNL.\" It was a good show, fueled mostly by the physical efforts of host Melissa McCarthy, but, overall, the material wasn't there. The thing about McCarthy is that not everything has to involve her falling down or saying weird things -- she can play subversive, too (as we saw at times during the \"Outside the Lines\" sketch). \n \n The first time McCarthy hosted, it was the \"McCarthy and Wiig\" show, playing off the success of \"Bridesmaids.\" Thankfully (for the sake of being too obvious), there was no cameo from Kristen Wiig, which left McCarthy open to do different types of sketches. It's just a shame that, for the most part, the writers didn't take full advantage of that. Here is your SNL Scorecard: \n \n Sketch of the Night \n \n \"Outside the Lines\" (Melissa McCarthy, Bill Hader, Tim Robinson, Bobby Moynihan, Jay Pharoah, Cecily Strong) Mike Rice, until recently, was the head coach for Rutger's men's basketball team. He lost that job after a video surfaced of Rice abusing players physically and verbally. It's a quite disturbing video, and \"SNL\" was wise to directly lampoon Rice, but instead, put McCarthy in a character who is \"worse\" than Rice: Not only did Shelia Kelly throw basketballs at players, as Rice was wont to due, Shelia Kelly will throw toasters and drive over players with a golf cart. This was by far the best use of McCarthy during the show. \n \n Score: 8.5 \n \n The Good \n \n \"Bathroom Businessman\" (Kenan Thompson, Nasim Pedrad) Admittedly, I was initially rolling my eyes during \"Bathroom Businessman,\" thinking, Oh, wonderful, here's a lazy commercial parody for a computer in a bathroom stall that ends with a poop joke. Lovely. Then, the rug was pulled out from underneath the segment, transforming the entire message into a plea to stop working on your electronic equipment from the bathroom because it's disgusting. \"Brought to you by Decency.\" \n \n Score: 7.8 \n \n \"Weekend Update\" (Seth Meyers, Vanessa Bayer, Keenan Thompson, Bobby Moynihan, Peter Dinklage) It's always nice seeing Peter Dinklage pop up somewhere, but that was a waste of a Peter Dinklage appearance. Put it this way: If someone had told me that Dinklage was going to be on the show last night, \"appearing for the last two minutes of Drunk Uncle\" would have been low on my wish list for him. Alas. Regardless: Hey, Peter Dinklage! \n \n Seth Meyers seemed refreshed and extremely sharp (perhaps rumors of getting your own late night talk show will do such things). I may be in the minority, but I love Vanessa Bayer's Jacob -- yes, she somehow does look like a 13-year-old boy. And Kenan Thompson's Charles Barkley was, like always, OK. \n \n Score: 7.0 \n \n \"Ham Bake-off\" (Melisa McCarthy, Jason Sudeikis, Kenan Thompson, Cecily Strong, Nasim Pedrad, Taran Killam, Bobby Moynihan) The best part about McCarthy's \"Ham Bakeoff\" dance routine was that the word \"ham\" being relentlessly repeated over and over during the performance. In the end, this was certainly fine, but not quite as special as it seemed like it was going to be on first viewing -- meaning that McCarthy really sells this one. \n \n (Not online due to song rights issues.) \n \n Score: 7.0 \n \n \"Melissa McCarthy Monologue\" (Melissa McCarthy, Taran Killam) It's hard to do something \"different\" during the monologue. Melissa McCarthy struggling to get down the stairs in her new high heels, coupled with her purposely lame jokes, was certainly different. \n \n Score: 6.8 \n \n \"Pizza Business\" (Melissa McCarthy, Jason Sudeikis) This one grew on me. To be fair, it aired right after \"Million Dollar Wheel\" and I was still annoyed -- but, by the end of the sketch, I'd invest in a leftover pizza eater myself. Also of note, if this is Jason Sudeikis' last season, I will miss him playing the \"normal\" character. Somehow he still makes it funny. \n \n Score: 6.5 \n \n \"Art of the Encounter\" (Cecily Strong, Kate McKinnon, Melissa McCarthy, Taran Killam, Bobby Moynihan, Tim Robinson) Well, this was certainly weird -- and certainly fit the bill for a \"10 to 1\" sketch. I think that my favorite part was that it was set in the 1990s, even though there really was no reason for it to be set in the 1990s. And I do like it when Cecily Strong plays \"weird,\" something she's been doing more of lately, instead of just relying on \"funny accents.\" \n \n Score: 6.0 \n \n The Bad \n \n \"The Voice\" (Taran Killam, Melissa McCarthy, Bill Hader, Jason Sudeikis, Jay Pharoah, Kate McKinnon, Kenan Thompson) I feel \"SNL\" has really wanted to do a sketch based on \"The Voice\" -- other than that quick hit they did during Adam Levine's monologue -- for some time. (It's been killed at dress rehearsal in the past.) Of course, it appears that they didn't really know quite what to do in that sketch. Regardless, Bill Hader's Levine is fantastic -- not fantastic enough to carry an entire sketch, but it's fantastic. \n \n Score: 4.5 \n \n \"Cold Open: C-Span North Korea\" (Bobby Moynihan, Dennis Rodman) OK, enough is enough with this sketch. Who is it that just loves this sketch so much that it just keeps on opening \"SNL\" and killing all momentum right off the bat? Seriously? Oh, what a change up, instead of Fred Armisen speaking gibberish underneath a translator, this time it's Bobby Moynihan Kim Jong Un. I'm sure these will continue because someone obviously loves them, but they have more than run their course. And, no, in 2013 a Dennis Rodman cameo isn't edgy or the least bit interesting. \n \n Score: 2.5 \n \n The Ugly \n \n \"Million Dollar Wheel\" (Melissa McCarthy, Bill Hader, Nasim Pedrad, Fred Armisen, Tim Robinson) And, in direct comparison with \"Outside the Lines,\" this was the worst use of McCarthy during the show. I kept waiting and waiting for the punchline. But, no, McCarthy's character really was just dumb and didn't know where the \"D's\" were. \n \n Score: 2.0 \n \n Average Score for this Show: 5.86 \n \n Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment.

    "document": "Sure, he looks good. But how about his sperm? \n \n That might not be such a ridiculous-sounding question, now that a new study has identified a link between men's facial attractiveness and the quality of their semen--with handsome, masculine-looking guys having slightly lower-quality semen than other men. \n \n \"To [the] best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the phenomenon,\" study co-author Dr. Jukka Kekalainen, adjunct lecturer in the Centre for Evolutionary Biology at the University of Australia in Crawley, told The Huffington Post in an email. \n \n The researchers have no ready explanation for their finding, although previous research has shown that high testosterone levels can harm sperm production, the New York Daily News reported. And the finding seems to be at odds with the so-called phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis, which holds that females prefer handsome males because their offspring may enjoy hereditary benefits, such as better health and higher intelligence. \n \n For the new study, which was published in the September 2014 issue of the Journal of Evolutionary Biology, a team of researchers from Spain, Australia, and Colombia performed semen analyses on 50 Caucasian students recruited from the University of Valencia. Next, photos of the men's faces were shown to heterosexual men and women in their twenties, including Caucasians and blacks. \n \n The women evaluators were asked to rate the men as if they were looking for a long-term mate. The men evaluators were asked to rate the men as they thought women would rate them. \n \n The researchers also performed an \"anthropometric analysis\" of the facial characteristics of all 50 men, measuring the size of their eyes, the width of their cheekbones and nostrils, and other markers that previous research identified as masculine features. And finally the researchers compared the men's facial features with the motility (movement), morphology (structure), and concentration of the men's sperm cells. \n \n In addition to looking for the link between masculine-looking faces and sperm quality, the researchers wanted to know if men's sperm quality was related to their handsomeness. \n \n \"And we found that in fact it is,\" Kekalainen said in the email. \n \n But does that mean women eager to find a mate capable of fathering children should be wary of handsome men? Maybe not--at least not until more research corroborates the finding. As Kekalainen said in the email, \"we would need more studies to demonstrate the causation and mechanism behind this finding...before giving any mating tips to the females.\" \n \n ||||| Tall, dark, and handsome is the popular description used to describe the perfect man for most women. From the brooding and sultry looks of Hollywood favorites, like George Clooney and David Beckham, women swoon over these men because of their celebrated physical attractiveness. However, science suggests setting your sights on much shorter, dark and handsome men, like Tom Cruise, because they make better life partners. According to a recent study (not peer reviewed), short men have a higher income and are more likely to stay monogamous, making better boyfriends and husbands, and standing head and shoulders above their much taller peers. \n \n Short men have been stigmatized in society because of their stature. The cultural vision of taller men as being physically dominant and potential protectors has been embedded into the psyche of many women, creating a \u201cprejudice\u201d against shorter men. It\u2019s unclear whether women prefer this because of society\u2019s pressure for women to be slim or because of an evolutionary perspective. Dr. David Frederick, an assistant professor of Psychology at Chapman University, examines how social remission processes and our evolved psychology interact to influence our close relationships and our views of what is attractive. He has hypothesized women may prefer a taller partner because it can make them feel smaller, or women have developed a preference for taller men because of the advantages height can provide them in male-on-male competitions, The Huffington Post reported. \n \n To examine the effects of male height on various relationship outcomes in longer-term relationships, researchers Dalton Conley, a sociologist at New York University, and Abigail Weitzman, a Ph.D. candidate, collected data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics \u2014 a University of Michigan project that\u2019s been collecting demographic data on 5,000 families for almost 50 years. This data was used to look at how a man\u2019s height impacts different areas of his relationship after the initial dating period. Conley and Weitzman looked at two sets of data, from 1986 and 2009, and identified 3,033 heterosexual couples. The male sample size was restricted between the ages of 23 and 45, and consisted of men who were cohabitating with a woman. \n \n The male participants ranged in height from 4-foot-6 to 7-feet. In relation to their partners, their height ranged 9 inches shorter to 2 feet taller. The researchers categorized these men into three groups: \u201cShort\u201d men were defined as 5-foot-6 or less in 1986, 5-foot-7 or below in 2009; \u201ctall\u201d men were at least 6-foot-1 in 1986 and 6-foot-2 in 2009. \n \n The findings revealed short men were less likely to get divorced, more likely to share housework, and be the breadwinners at home. These men were somewhat less likely to get married, with an 18 percent marriage rate lower than men of average height, at every age before 45. Weitzman believes this is because short men may have a harder time getting married, since they\u2019re viewed as less masculine by society. However, when they do find a partner, the divorce rates are 32 percent lower for short men compared to the rates for tall and average men. \n \n In regard to housework, shorter men perform eight hours and 28 minutes per week of housework \u2014 this comprises about 28 percent of the total \u2014 compared to seven hours and 38 minutes for average men and seven hours and 30 minutes for tall men, New Republic reported. Weitzman believes tall men may be \u201caware of the status that is conferred by their tallness,\u201d which may make them prone to do less work at home. While these men fare better with housework, but they also tend to have higher household incomes than their partners. The researchers estimated 79 percent of short men make more money than their significant others, compared to 70 percent of average men, and 71 percent of tall men. This finding conflicts with previous research that has found taller men earn more money. \n \n Throughout the study, the researchers noticed a consistent pattern with short men and their partners: They were more likely to partner with women who are older, less educated, and younger. Twenty-one percent of these men were with women who had not completed high school, compared to 16 percent of average men, and just 12 percent of tall men. Also, when it comes to age, it is not just a number for them. In the entire sample size, only nine percent of men partnered with a woman who was more than three years older. Age is an area where the short men can exude their masculinity by partnering with a younger woman. \n \n This study coincides with another recent study published in the Journal of Family Issues, which found women err on the side of caution when it comes to height and online dating. About 50 percent of women restricted their online dating searches to men who were taller than them. This finding was also consistent when the same team of researchers took a survey of college students and found about 30 percent of women would feel \u201cawkward\u201d or \u201cweird\u201d dating a shorter guy. \n \n Perhaps it\u2019s time to put an end to these men getting the shorter end of the stick. After all, your Mr. Right could be shorter than you. \n \n Sources: Conley D, Weitzman A.

Journal of Family Issues. 2014. ||||| Guys with classically masculine facial features, such as square jawlines and pronounced cheekbones, may produce sperm of a lower quality than men who don\u2019t share the same features, a new study finds. \n \n The findings rely on an oft-studied phenomenon in the animal kingdom known as the phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis. It states the greater presence of male sexual ornaments signals a stronger vitality for reproduction. These ornaments are typically anatomical in nature, such as the set of feathers on one species of bird or the song of another. \n \n But in humans the hypothesis hasn\u2019t gotten much attention. So researchers recruited a group of 62 college students, from both Colombia and Spain, to rate the physical attractiveness of select pictures of men who had donated their sperm earlier in the experiment. Researchers censored all but the subjects\u2019 faces, including hairstyle, to minimize external influences. \n \n ketrin1407, CC BY 2.0 \n \n They compared levels of attractiveness, masculinity, and sperm health to determine which features, if any, correlated with one another. The results were decidedly lukewarm. While they did find a significant negative relationship between masculine features and sperm motility, the significance vanished when the team controled for outright unhealthy sperm. It was the outliers, in other words, that were doing the heavy lifting. \n \n So, the hypothesis didn\u2019t seem to ring as true as they might have expected. But they did find a relationship between how males perceived males versus how females perceived males. The subjects most likely to rate the faces as attractive were other men, and particularly among the Spanish students. \n \n \u201cThis suggests that male facial cues may provide culture- and sex-independent information about male fertility,\u201d they wrote. However, it also indicates humans may be poor judges of attractiveness when it comes to people who are culturally near to them. And males, on average, are worse judges than females. \n \n What does the study say about the phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis as it relates to humans? Unfortunately, not much. A large camp of evolutionary biology likes to believe the animalistic traits we possessed as ancient hominids have changed to accommodate modern-day mating rituals. All women want tall, protective men in good social standing, they are apt to say. Beneath our material, hi-tech infatuations are primal desires that prove even if we\u2019re a population of smart animals, we\u2019re still animals. \n \n Science is increasingly finding these theories don\u2019t hold much water. Tall men, with their far-reaching gaze, may have the advantage over short men when it comes to scanning the plains for enemies, or dinner, but if a woman\u2019s goal is to keep a tidy house and send her kids to college, short men \u2014 the biological underdogs \u2014 tend to prevail. \n \n Prior research has upheld the link between elevated testosterone levels and poor sperm. In their study, masculine men were thought to have low sperm counts in part because they don\u2019t need as much, being the sexual dynamos they are. However, since the researchers were also measuring attractiveness, it\u2019s worth mentioning the attractive men (who weren\u2019t necessarily masculine) had better sperm. Chalk this one up to round jaws and low cheekbones. \n \n Source: Soler C, Kek\u00e4l\u00e4inen J, N\u00fa\u00f1ez M, et al.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Macho guys may attract more women, but the quality of their sperm might not be of he-man standards, a new study suggests. Oddly, the sperm of good-looking guys\u2014but not necessarily macho ones with square jaws and distinct cheekbones\u2014is just fine, reports Medical Daily. The link was found when researchers analyzed the semen of 62 Caucasian men, then compared its motility and structure to facial measurements of masculine traits and ratings of their attractiveness, the Huffington Post explains. Scientists theorize that the macho man trades virility for a gravely voice and ripped arms, and high testosterone hinders sperm production. Meanwhile, the study casts doubt on the belief the \"phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis\" (read: fancy feathers and pretty songs attract more ladies) applies to humans. A study that claimed short guys are preferred by women over tall ones, long believed to have the evolutionary upper hand, has also poked holes in that theory. But don't revamp your mating habits just yet, girls\u2014researchers say their findings need further study. (Short guys are also less likely to divorce you.)",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Short, dark, and handsome men may not be what women are looking for in a mate, according to a new study in the Journal of Evolutionary Biology. Researchers from Spain, Australia, and Colombia studied semen samples from heterosexual men and women in their 20s, showing them photos of handsome, masculine-looking men and asking them to rate the men as if they were looking for a long-term partner. They also analyzed the men's facial characteristics, measuring the width of their eyes, the width of their nostrils, and other markers identified by previous research, the Huffington Post reports. They found a link between the quality of the men's semen and their facial attractiveness. \"To [the] best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the phenomenon,\" study co-author Dr. Jukka Kekalainen says in an email. The researchers have no ready explanation for their finding, although previous research has shown that high testosterone levels can harm sperm production. And the finding seems to be at odds with the so-called phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis, which holds that females prefer handsome males because their offspring may enjoy hereditary benefits, such as better health and higher intelligence. For the new study, which was published in the September 2014 issue of the Journal of Evolutionary Biology, a team of researchers from Spain, Australia, and Colombia performed semen analyses on 50 Caucasian students recruited from the University of Valencia. Next, photos of the men's faces were shown to heterosexual men and women in their twenties, including Caucasians and blacks. The women evaluators were asked to rate the men as if they were looking for a long-term mate, the New York Daily News reports.

Democratic leaders, he ranted over the weekend on WKPQ, in Hornell, N.Y., \"are going to ram this down the throats of the American people, and anyone who stands in the way of doing that is going to be smeared and they're going to be kicked out of Congress.\" \n \n Twice on the show, he urged listeners to \"call Fox News\" to get him booked on the conservative news network.

Actionable stuff? Anything specific? -- Massa came up empty. \"I don't know how to be specific,\" he said. \n \n In the show's waning minutes, Beck surrendered. \"America, I've got to shoot straight with you,\" he said, looking into the camera. \"I think I've wasted your time.

Many clinics at Walgreens and CVS pharmacies have been flooded with patients with flu-like symptoms. \n \n Waddie Grant started suffering flu-like symptoms Tuesday morning. First, he tried to get in to see his doctor, but couldn\u2019t get in right away, so he decided to go to a Walgreens Take Care Clinic in the Loop. \n \n \u201cI started feeling this little lump in my throat, and then some kind of a slight temperature,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get sick.\u201d \n \n Walgreens pharmacy manager Nancy Salman said, \u201cThe Take Care Clinic has been extremely busy. It\u2019s been inundated with appointments, and walk-ins. They\u2019ve seen anywhere from 20 to 25 patients a day.\u201d \n \n The flu season in Chicago started much earlier than normal and is expected to be one of the worst in several years, medical experts have said. \n \n Illinois Public Health Director Dr. LaMar Hasbrouck told WBBM Newsradio that last year at this time, there had only been two people with flu-like symptoms admitted to the intensive care units of hospitals in Illinois, with no deaths. \n \n So far this season, he says, 147 people have been admitted to hospital intensive care units due to the flu, and six of those people have died. \n \n Patients in need of critical care\u2013such as those suffering from a stroke\u2013would still be admitted to hospitals on bypass, Arnold told the Sun-Times. \n \n The flu is hitting earlier and harder this year not only in Chicago but across the country, WBBM Newsradio\u2019s Lisa Fielding reports. \n \n \u201cWe aren\u2019t seeing very sick people. We\u2019re just seeing more sick people,\u201d said Mary Alice Lavin, Director of infection, prevention and control with Rush University Medical Center. \n \n Lavin says even though they encourage the flu vaccine, it doesn\u2019t always guarantee immunity. \n \n \u201cThe viruses that were included in the vaccine this year are the ones that are circulating this year but studies have shown that the vaccine is only effective in 60 percent of people.\u201d \n \n play pause Will Vaccine Work? \n \n WBBM Newsradio's Lisa Fielding \n \n \n \n \n \n Lavin says those who\u2019ve gotten the vaccine don\u2019t get as sick as those who haven\u2019t. \n \n The flu shot also takes about two weeks to be effective. Rush has seen 203 cases of the flu since Nov. 5, much higher than years past. Flu season usually lasts through March. \n \n Dr. Julie Morita of the Chicago Department of Public Health says city residents can call 311 to find out where to get a free flu shot. \n \n Doctors also advise patients who have had the flu for two days to avoid coming to the emergency room. Instead, stay home and treat yourself with plenty of fluids, rest and proper hygiene. Flu medications are only effective if taken during the initial stages of symptoms. \n \n Dr. David Zich, internal medicine and emergency medicine physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, says that if you get flu symptoms, you\u2019re still considered contagious until 24 hours after your fever is gone. \n \n At Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn, Dr. Brian Sayger, vice-chairman of Emergency Medicine, suggests that, if you start coming down with flu-like symptoms such as a high fever, achy body, chills and shakes, within 48 hours, you should ask your doctor to prescribe an antiviral flu drug like Tamiflu. \n \n Antivirals, he says, tend to work best at reducing the severity of symptoms\u2013not ending the flu\u2013if taken in that two-day window. ||||| The flu is racing across nearly 30 U.S. states and it's leaving a deadly trail \n \n Melissa Roberts, left, administers a flu vaccine to Kelly Ternes at the Okaloosa County Health Department in Fort Walton Beach, Fla., Dec. 20, 2012. (Photo: Nick Tomecek, AP) Story Highlights Eighteen children have died, over 2,200 people hospitalized so far \n \n Flu is widespread throughout the U.S. \n \n Nearly 30 states have flulike activity \n \n Chances are that you or someone you know has been chained to the bed recently with fever, fatigue, sore throat and muscle aches. \n \n That's because the current flu season is turning out to be a bad one, affecting more people than usual, starting earlier and covering a broader geographical area. Government health experts say 18 children, under age 18, have died because of the seasonal flu and 2,257 people had been hospitalized with flu symptoms through the end of 2012. \n \n \"The sense that everybody has is that there's been an extremely rapid increase in influenza,\" says Trish Perl,co-leader of a flu study encompassing about 100 clinics in several cities. She is also an epidemiologist for the Johns Hopkins Health System in Baltimore. \"It has been relatively widespread across the United States.\" \n \n The public should be concerned, says Gregory Poland, professor of medicine and infectious disease at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. \n \n \"A decade ago, when we had widespread circulation (of the seasonal flu), we had 70,000 deaths in the U.S.,\" says Poland, who directs Mayo's Vaccine Research Group. \n \n \"We have this cultural thing in the U.S. about, 'Oh, it's just the flu.' I was telling a group yesterday, imagine in October I said, 'We expect a virus to be circulating in the U.S. and it will kill 30- or 40,000 Americans.' Can you imagine the panic that would ensue?\" \n \n For the fourth week in a row, the proportion of people seeing health care providers for flulike illness is above the national baseline, and jumped from 2.8% to 5.6% in that time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Last season's proportion peaked at 2.2%, the CDC reports. \n \n Twenty-nine states plus New York City are now reporting high flulike activity, up from 16 states the week before, the CDC says. Forty-one states reported in the last week of December that flulike activity was widespread geographically, with that number up from 31 states the week before, according to the CDC. \n \n During the last week of 2012, 7% of all deaths reported in 122 U.S. cities were due to pneumonia and the flu, according to the CDC. That figure is just below the epidemic threshold of 7.1% for the last week of the year. \n \n The medical industry is concerned because this is the earliest flu season the U.S. has seen in the past 10 to 12 years, says Michael Jhung, an epidemiologist and influenza expert at the CDC. \n \n Flu season usually peaks in January and February, according to the Flu.gov website maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services. \n \n The predominant type of flu that is circulating is H3N2 Influenza A virus, which is making up 76% of the viruses reported, according to the CDC. \n \n The outbreak has strongly affected the East and the South and is spreading westward, Poland says. \n \n Perl reports from her studies that initially health professionals were seeing a lot of Influenza B, but now they are seeing mostly A as well as other respiratory illnesses, including respiratory syncytial virus or RSV. \n \n H3N2 flu seasons tend to be more severe, Poland of the Mayo Clinic says. \n \n On the ground, the outbreak has sent more people to doctors and hospitals with flu symptoms. \n \n For instance, in Minnesota, 600 people were hospitalized because of the flu and four people died, Poland says. Among those who died was an otherwise healthy 17-year-old boy who was visiting the Twin Cities area from Texas, according to Poland. \n \n The professor said he's hearing similar stories from colleagues around the country of people who are generally healthy being hit hard. \n \n In Indiana, seven deaths have been associated with influenza, two in people younger than 18. \n \n \"It's not too late to get vaccinated, and the CDC encourages everyone who hasn't been to do so soon,\" Jhung says. \n \n Enough vaccine has been produced and distributed so that everyone who wants a shot should be able to get one. He urges, though, that if people run into delays because of a run on vaccine, not to be discouraged. \n \n \"People \u2026 may have to go to more than one pharmacy,\" Jhung says. \n \n Perl says the outbreak also is a good opportunity for the public to remember that hand-washing and use of sanitizing gels can reduce infection rates by 30%. \n \n \"It's an opportunity for us to reinforce those basic things your mom always told you,\" she says. \n \n While health experts advise people to get the flu vaccine and use hand sanitizer, some research shows children who attend daycare or tend to be exposed to more allergens may build up stronger defenses.

Visitors must also be 19-years-old or older. \n \n The medical centers are also requesting visitors with flu-like symptoms, or have been diagnosed the flu within the past seven days, to refrain from visiting patients. All visitors are also asked to wash their hands before and after visiting a patient, or use alcohol-based hand sanitizer to help control the spread of the flu. \n \n The temporary visitation guidelines come as the Centers for Disease Control announced this season\u2019s flu is both more potent than in previous years, and spreading quicker than average. \n \n So far, the CDC says at least 41 states have reported cases of the seasonal flu. \n \n For more information about the seasonal flu and visitation guidelines, visit the Lake County General Health District website by clicking here. \n \n The website for the Centers for Disease Control can be found here. ||||| HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. - We're still weeks away from the historical peak of the flu season, but now it appears the nation may be behind the curve as the flu is already spreading like wildfire. \n \n Here in Florida, the panhandle, central Florida and southern Florida are seeing the biggest jump in cases. \n \n The issue concerning many is the fact that some got a flu shot, but still have contracted the virus. \n \n Breaking down the numbers, the Centers For Disease Control has tracked at least 2,257 hospitalizations and 18 deaths nationwide among just children this flu season. \n \n The days of people 65 and over and young kids being the ones who were the most at risk and were strongly encouraged to get a vaccine are now over. \n \n The CDC is recommending that everyone get vaccinated this year and no, its not too late! \n \n Getting vaccinated each year provides the best protection against influenza throughout the flu season. \n \n The train being seen a lot this year is that of H3N2. \n \n The good news is, this year's vaccine was made from an H3N2 flu like virus, with each vaccine containing three different viruses, giving the vaccinated individual even more protection. \n \n But its not full proof if you come in contact with another strain. \n \n It's getting so bad that some cities, like Cleveland and Boston, are reporting that hospitals are restricting visitors for fear of contamination. \n \n \"We are evaluating whether we are going to need to take other special measures such as screening visitors to the institution, screening employees as measure to try and control, or better understand the volume of influenza in the hospital,\" says Dr. Kenneth E. Sands of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. \n \n So does it mean that this year's vaccine isn't working because the outbreak is the worst the nation has seen in years? \n \n \"No, it doesn't mean that at all,\" says Dr. Robert Glatter of Lenox Hill Hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side. \"Generally, in proportion to the population, a number of people will still contract the flu virus even though they've been vaccinated.\" \n \n Doctors say the vaccine is still your best defense though. While you may still contract the virus, it may not be as severe. Physicians also point out that the vaccine takes about two weeks to take full effect in the body. The CDC is suggesting those who have severe flu symptoms or are at risk of serious flu-related symptoms to also think about taking an anti-viral medication. \n \n In addition to the vaccine, be sure to do all the things right to keep yourself clean. \n \n Washing your hands constantly, keeping your hands away from your face, taking a shower immediately when you get home, and remembering that you could still infect someone with the flu seven days after your symptoms are gone, so be sure to STAY HOME if you think you may have it. \n \n To pinpoint the flu impact in your specific area, visit http://www.doh.state.fl.us/Disease_ctrl/immune/flu/index.html and to find a place you can get your flu shot visit http://www.hillscountyhealth.org/",

    "document": "KABUL (Reuters) - Twelve people were killed on Friday in the bloodiest day yet in protests that have raged across Afghanistan over the desecration of copies of the Muslim holy book at a NATO military base with riot police and soldiers on high alert braced for more violence. \n \n The burning of the Korans at the Bagram compound earlier this week has deepened public mistrust of NATO forces struggling to stabilize Afghanistan before foreign combat troops withdraw in 2014. \n \n Hundreds of Afghans marched toward the palace of Afghan President Hamid Karzai in Kabul, while on the other side of the capital protesters hoisted the white flag of the Taliban. \n \n Chanting \"Death to America!\" and \"Long live Islam!,\" protesters also threw rocks at police in Kabul, while Afghan army helicopters circled above. \n \n Friday is a holy day and the official weekly holiday in Afghanistan and mosques in the capital drew large crowds, with police in pick-up trucks posted on nearby streets. \n \n Armed protesters took refuge in shops in the eastern part of the city, where they killed one demonstrator, said police at the scene. In another Kabul rally, police said they were unsure who fired the shots that killed a second protester. \n \n Seven more protesters were killed in the western province of Herat, two more in eastern Khost province and one in the relatively peaceful northern Baghlan province, health and local officials said. In Herat, around 500 men charged at the U.S. consulate. \n \n U.S. President Barack Obama had sent a letter to Karzai apologizing for the unintentional burning of the Korans at NATO's main Bagram air base, north of Kabul, after Afghan laborers found charred copies while collecting rubbish. \n \n Muslims consider the Koran to be the literal word of God and treat each copy with deep reverence. Desecration is considered one of the worst forms of blasphemy. \n \n Afghanistan wants NATO to put those responsible on public trial. \n \n In neighboring U.S. ally Pakistan, about 400 members of a hardline Islamist group staged protests. \"If you burn the Koran, we will burn you,\" they shouted. \n \n To Afghanistan's west, Iranian cleric Ahmad Khatami said the U.S. had purposely burned the Korans. \"These apologies are fake. The world should know that America is against Islam,\" he said in a speech broadcast live on state radio. \n \n \"It (the Koran burning) was not a mistake. It was an intentional move, done on purpose.\" \n \n Most Westerners have been confined to their heavily fortified compounds, including at the sprawling U.S. embassy complex and other diplomatic missions, as protests that have killed a total of 23 people, including two U.S. soldiers, rolled into their fourth day. The embassy, in a message on the microblogging site Twitter, urged U.S. citizens to \"please be safe out there\" and expanded movement restrictions to relatively peaceful northern provinces, where large demonstrations also occurred Thursday, including the attempted storming of a Norwegian military base. \n \n The Taliban urged Afghan security forces Thursday to \"turn their guns on the foreign infidel invaders\" and repeatedly urged Afghans to kill, beat and capture NATO soldiers. \n \n Germany, which has the third-largest foreign presence in the NATO-led war, pulled out several weeks early of a small base in the northern Takhar province Friday over security concerns, a defense ministry spokesman said. \n \n (Additional reporting by Amira Mitri in TEHRAN, Imtiaz Shah in KARACHI, Sabine Siebold in BERLIN, Writing by Amie Ferris-Rotman; Editing by Michael Georgy and Ed Lane) ||||| It was unclear on Friday night whether, after four days of protests, the violence that has rolled through the country was finally spent, or if the Koran burning had uncorked an inexhaustible well of fury over the continuing presence of Western troops after 10 years of war. In some measure, the angry demonstrations were to be expected in a religious country fed up with foreigners, but the tension this week seems more pervasive and irresolvable than in the past. \n \n \u201cThe violence is almost within the normal realm of things that you would see after this kind of incident,\u201d said Martine Van Bijlert, a co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, a policy and research institute in Kabul. \u201cThe big question is, how long does it go on?

Protesters there were armed and some appeared to be agents provocateurs, government officials said. \n \n \u201cPeople were on their way home after the prayer when a number of opposition and agitator people, misusing the pure emotions of the people, urged them to go toward the United States Consulate in the city,\u201d said Mohyaddin Noori, the spokesman for Herat\u2019s provincial governor. \u201cOn the way to the consulate, some of these riotous people who were armed opened fire and were throwing rocks.\u201d \n \n One of the vehicles hit by gunfire was a police truck full of ammunition, which exploded, sending bullets in all directions and wounding 65 people, he said. \n \n Several Heratis suggested that Iranian agents were at work behind the scenes. Some noted that Radio Mashad, an Iranian station, had urged action against Western interests in Afghanistan, taking advantage of a moment when people\u2019s emotions were running high, said Mohammed Rafiq Shaheer, a professor of political science at Herat University. He noted that protesters appeared to have been directed to march towards the American Consulate by mullahs in several areas of the city. \n \n He said that he blamed Pakistani and Iranian intelligence. Both agencies, he said, \u201chave invested a lot in this country and they have people loyal to them, and this is a perfect time for the intelligence apparatus of the neighboring countries to ignite people\u2019s fiery emotions which would lead them to violence.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Two protesters died in Khost Province, near the Pakistan border, and one in Baghlan Province. \n \n In Kabul, despite larger numbers of protesters on the streets, only a handful were injured. \n \n Interior Minister Bismullah Khan adopted a nuanced strategy that encouraged the protesters to express themselves peacefully, but also put in place a phalanx of police units to keep the most menacing from making their way to the center of the city. \n \n Photo \n \n Riot police officers backed up by heavily armed special units in some 40 police trucks faced down an estimated 4,000 men wielding rocks and sticks after Friday Prayer. At one point as the two groups neared each other, protesters threw rocks and shouted, but the police did not fire and eventually moved the protesters back. \n \n A few of the protesters were waving the Taliban\u2019s white flag, some wore head wrappings bearing the jihad slogan \u201cI sacrifice myself,\u201d and protesters throughout the city shouted \u201cDeath to America.\u201d \n \n The police also broke up another crowd of about 1,000 in central Kabul, first by driving trucks into the crowd to disperse it and then by chasing the protesters on foot and hitting them with rubber batons. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Early reports said that the books had inflammatory messages written in them from detained Taliban suspects. Most of the Korans that were rescued from the flames are still at Bagram Air Base in a locked container. They are viewed as evidence, a NATO spokesman said. A few of the Korans were taken out of the base by Afghan employees. \n \n The absence of lethal violence in Kabul belies a deep frustration that appeared in interviews with police officers and protesters alike, a sense that justice has not yet been done and a suspicion that the United States, while apologizing, will not hold anyone to account. \n \n \u201cJust by saying \u2018I am sorry,\u2019 nothing can be solved,\u201d said Wali Mohammed, one of the protesters. \u201cWe want an open trial for those infidels who have burned our Holy Koran.\u201d \n \n Mohammed Anwar, an off-duty police officer, had joined the protesters on Friday and seemed barely able to contain his fury. \u201cI will take revenge from the infidels for what they did to our Holy Koran, and I will kill them whenever I get the chance,\u201d he said as he walked with crowd of protesters wielding rocks and sticks. \u201cI don\u2019t care about the job I have.\u201d ||||| Germany says it has withdrawn troops from an outpost in northern Afghanistan amid protests over the burning of Qurans at a U.S. base. \n \n Defense Ministry spokesman Stefan Paris said the German military, which handed over security responsibility for the Taloqan area to Afghan authorities on Feb. 15, had originally planned to shut down its base there altogether in late March. \n \n But, he said Friday, the regional commander decided in view of demonstrations in Taloqan and elsewhere in the north _ which led to injuries but no deaths _ that the 50 remaining German soldiers should pull back to a larger base in Kunduz immediately. \n \n Paris says the soldiers already have made the roughly 43-mile (70-kilometer) transfer to Kunduz and have taken most material from the Taloqan outpost with them. \n \n Germany has nearly 4,800 troops in northern Afghanistan.",

Mr. Eastwood is a musician, and he plays with the story\u2019s competing moods and rhythms with suppleness, setting one scene to the steady beat of everyday life, only to amp another until it races like a thudding heart. The accident, which remains unnervingly in the register of the real, is a master class in direction, as the reassuring engine hum gives way to a spooky near-silence that\u2019s soon punctured by gasps, cries and terrifying shouts: \u201cBrace, brace! Heads down, stay down!\u201d \n \n \u201cSully\u201d is a portrait of a hero \u2014 Mr. Sullenberger\u2019s decision to land the plane on the Hudson helped save 155 lives, his own included \u2014 but one who, after the accident, is troubled both by what might have been (death, destruction) and by an unassuming man\u2019s discomfort with the spotlight. Sully isn\u2019t cut along the cynically frayed lines of assorted current screen heroes, with their nihilism lite and butchery, nor does he fit the existential mode, the man in revolt, like Jason Bourne. Sully is hewed from more classical stuff; he\u2019s the hero whose dignity, as Lionel Trilling wrote, \u201cis wholly manifest in word and deed, in physique and comportment.\u201d Yet Sully is also very much alone, separated by ability and character, as well as by all the directorial choices that isolate him. \n \n Heroism has long been one of Mr. Eastwood\u2019s themes as an actor and a director, though his portraits tend to be complicated by an annihilating violence often unthinkable in the classical Hollywood days. Draped in black, as if swathed in mourning crepe, some of his most memorable later movies explore the tragic consequences of violence, which runs through communities and individuals alike. They\u2019re profoundly, sometimes uncomfortably, American testaments. By contrast, there\u2019s no tragedy in \u201cSully,\u201d just sighs of relief, probing questions and an outwardly uncomplicated hero whose extraordinariness is so deeply imbued that it is finally the most ordinary thing about him. You might think that Mr. Eastwood had mellowed, but the very singularity of this movie\u2019s hero suggests otherwise. ||||| \n \n Tom Hanks stars as hero pilot Chelsey \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger in \u201cSully,\u201d a film directed by Clint Eastwood. (Keith Bernstein/Warner Bros. Pictures) \n \n After a summer of bombast and belly-flops, the fall movie season gets off to a refreshingly sure-footed start with \u201cSully,\u201d a four-square, upstanding, rock-solid example of filmmaking at its most direct and honestly affecting. \n \n Tom Hanks plays Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger, the US Airways pilot who landed a plane bound from LaGuardia airport to Charlotte on the Hudson River in 2009, after his craft was struck by a flock of Canada geese. But this is no simplistic tale of heroism and crack timing \u2014 although they\u2019re in there. Instead \u201cSully,\u201d which Clint Eastwood directed from a script by Todd Komarnicki, introduces viewers to a man wracked by second thoughts and nightmare visions of what could have happened had he made the wrong decision. What\u2019s more, he\u2019s not the only one with doubts: The film\u2019s framing device is an investigation held by the National Transportation Safety Board, whose extensive simulations and computer algorithms suggested that Sullenberger probably had the engine power and time to make a safe landing back at LaGuardia, or in New Jersey. \n \n For audiences whose image of Sullenberger is the paragon of modesty and skill, aw-shucks-ing it through interviews with Katie Couric and David Letterman, this part of his story will come as a revelation, and an infuriating one at that: It seems impossible that anyone could second-guess a pilot whose 40-year career was so exemplary that he was known in the field as a safety expert. This alternative glimpse, as well as Eastwood\u2019s graceful staging of Sully\u2019s darkest what-if fantasies, as well as the landing itself, makes \u201cSully\u201d thoroughly engrossing and exciting to watch, even though viewers know the outcome. \n \n \n \n Sullenberger flies with first officer Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart), left. (Warner Bros. Pictures) \n \n Sporting a head of cropped white hair and a modest mustache, his face a sallow mask of discomfort with sudden fame and attention, Hanks is the perfect actor to play Sullenberger, whose reserve and low-key assuredness may remind the audience of the title character the actor played a few years ago in \u201cCaptain Phillips.\u201d There are laughs to be had in \u201cSully,\u201d especially in the banter between Sullenberger and first officer Jeff Skiles, played with bristling, barely contained energy by Aaron Eckhart. But there\u2019s nothing gratuitously ingratiating in a movie that instead goes to great pains to adopt the terse, economical work ethic of its protagonist. (Sully joins Sam Shepard\u2019s Chuck Yeager and Ed Harris\u2019s John Glenn in the pantheon of cinematic air heroes: taciturn, inherently trustworthy men of action, not showboating.) \n \n Beautifully filmed in and around a wintry Manhattan, and featuring spectacular sequences re-creating that iconic landing and rescue on Jan. 15, \u201cSully\u201d is also suffused with a particularly mournful sense of poignancy; the sight of a plane coming so perilously close to the buildings along the Upper West Side can\u2019t help but conjure the city\u2019s most grievous day eight years earlier, an observation made late in the film by one of Sully\u2019s colleagues. (New York deserves a happy ending, he tells him, especially one involving planes.) \n \n It\u2019s fitting that \u201cSully\u201d is arriving in theaters on the 15th anniversary of Sept. 11, 2001, a date that hovers around the proceedings like a tender, ghostly presence. Eastwood and his team not only pay fitting homage to Sullenberger, but to the squads of first responders who did their jobs so heroically on both days. \u201cSully\u201d is a classy, enormously satisfying ode to simple competence. To paraphrase the title character, it\u2019s just a movie doing its job. And amen to that. ||||| \u2018Sully\u2019: Brace for emotional impact of Tom Hanks\u2019 cockpit triumph \n \n It remains one of the indelible images of the 21st century. \n \n On a frigid January morning in 2009, dozens of passengers found themselves perched on the wings of US Airways Flight 1549 \u2014 in the Hudson River. \n \n Well. ON the Hudson River. \n \n Just a few minutes after takeoff, the plane was struck by a flock of Canadian geese, rendering both engines powerless and necessitating a return to LaGuardia Airport \u2014 but when it was determined there wasn\u2019t enough time to reach LaGuardia or any other nearby runway, the plane made an emergency crash landing on the water, and miraculously, all 155 passengers and crew survived. \n \n At the helm of Flight 1549 was one Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger, who within 24 hours became one of the most famous American pilots this side of Charles Lindbergh. \n \n It seems almost a foregone conclusion Clint Eastwood would direct and Tom Hanks would star in the movie version of the story. (Can you think of a better starting battery? I can\u2019t.) \n \n As accomplished as they are, it would be an understatement to say Eastwood and Hanks meet expectations. This isn\u2019t just a solid piece of work; it\u2019s resonant. \n \n The 86-year-old Eastwood gives us an electrifying thriller, a wonderful in-depth character study and a fascinating airline safety procedural, while Hanks delivers another in a long line of memorable, nomination-worthy performances. \n \n (Sidebar: How is it Tom Hanks hasn\u2019t been nominated for an Oscar since 2001 with \u201cCastaway\u201d? Could it be the Academy has fallen into a pattern of taking his comfortable, outwardly effortless genius for granted?) \n \n \u201cSully\u201d begins with the immediate aftermath of the water landing, with Hanks\u2019 Sully and his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart in one of his most measured and authentic performances), seemingly barely dried off being soaked in the icy waters of the Hudson when they have to face down a skeptical group of inquisitors from the National Transportation Safety Board, including Mike O\u2019Malley as Charles Porter and Anna Gunn from \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d as Dr. Elizabeth Davis. \n \n From the get-go, it\u2019s clear some on the panel believe Sully might have panicked and actually had enough engine power and enough altitude and time to get back to an airport. They ask Sully questions about how much sleep he had before the flight, when he had his last drink \u2014 and if he was experiencing any problems at home. \n \n They\u2019re looking for chinks in the armor of a man who was already being hailed as a hero in the media and who seemed a bit uncomfortable under the lights, but didn\u2019t say no to David Letterman or Katie Couric or plenty of other interview opportunities. \n \n Eastwood directs with his usual economical style. (Even his longest-running films rarely seem to waste our time with overlong scenes of exposition, or unnecessary supporting characters.) We learn a little about Sully\u2019s love of piloting and his resourcefulness in times of crisis via a couple of flashback scenes, and we\u2019re introduced to a handful of flight attendants and rather thinly sketched passengers, including two adult sons and their beloved old pops, a young woman with a baby and a grown woman and her elderly mother. \n \n Mostly, though, \u201cSully\u201d is about Sully. Hanks is so good he could play this character in a one-man show with nothing but a chair and a telephone onstage and it would be riveting. \n \n On the surface, Sully is a calm, cool, no-nonsense, self-effacing veteran of some 42 years as a pilot. But in the aftermath of the landing, he has visions of the plane smashing into Manhattan buildings, he has dreams of news reporters questioning his judgment, and he confesses his doubts and fears in intimate telephone conversations with his wife Lorraine (Laura Linney, who spends nearly every second of her screen time on the phone with Sully). \n \n Eventually, at just the right time, \u201cSully\u201d takes us through those harrowing, incredible 208 seconds when Flight 1549 is struck by those birds, and the engines burst into flames before dying out, and Sully and Skiles react in the cockpit, and the flight attendants repeatedly command, \u201cHeads down, stay down, heads down, stay down!\u201d and a commercial aircraft rapidly sinks in the skies above New York City (of all places) and eventually splashes down on the Hudson. \n \n The editing and the special effects and the performances are so pitch-perfect, this is as close as you\u2019d ever want to come to being on that flight on that January day. \n \n \u201cSully\u201d is an absolute triumph. \n \n \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 \n \n Warner Bros. Pictures presents a film directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Todd Komarnicki, based on the book \u201cHighest Duty\u201d by Chesley \u201cSully\u201d Sullenberger. Running time: 95 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for some peril and brief strong language). Opens Friday at local theaters.",

In particular, he offers \"a master class in direction\" during the accident scene, while Hanks makes a perfect Sully. Stephen Whitty at NJ.com says the accident scene is \"the best part of the film,\" but he's not so enthralled with the rest of it.

Flashbacks to Sully's youth \"add nothing but time,\" while the National Transportation Board Safety Board investigation delivers no drama or suspense, he adds. Ann Hornaday doesn't agree.

The Palm Beach County Sheriff\u2019s... (Associated Press) \n \n Tiger Woods was arrested early Monday on a DUI charge in Jupiter, Florida, and spent nearly four hours in a county jail before he was released. \n \n Woods, the 14-time major champion who ranks second with his 79 career victories on the PGA Tour, has not played for four months. He is out for the rest of the season while he recovers from his fourth back surgery. \n \n Woods was arrested on suspicion of DUI about 3 a.m. Monday in a suburban area and taken to the Palm Beach County jail, Jupiter Police spokeswoman Kristin Rightler said. He was arrested on Military Trail, south of Indian Creek Parkway. \n \n Jail records show that 41-year-old golf great was booked into Palm Beach County jail at 7:18 a.m. and released on his own recognizance at 10:50 a.m. The jail released a booking photo of Woods in a white T-shirt. \n \n Rightler said she did not have additional details about the circumstances leading to Woods' arrest, nor did she have any information about whether the arrest involved drugs or alcohol. She said an arrest report may be available Tuesday. \n \n His agent at Excel Sports, Mark Steinberg, did not immediately respond to a voicemail from The Associated Press. PGA Tour spokesman Ty Votaw said the tour would have no comment. \n \n Woods has not been seen at a golf tournament since he opened with a 77 at the Omega Dubai Desert Classic, withdrawing the next day because of back spasms. He was in Los Angeles for the Genesis Open, run by his Tiger Woods Foundation, but did not come to the course because of his back. \n \n He was at the Masters, but only to attend the dinner for past champions. \n \n Woods, who had been No. 1 longer than any other golfer, has not been a factor since his last victory in August 2013 as he battled through back surgeries from a week before the 2014 Masters until his most recent operation to fuse disks in his lower back a month ago. \n \n In an update Friday on his website, Woods said the fusion surgery provided instant relief and he hasn't \"felt this good in years.\" \n \n It was the first time Woods has run into trouble off the golf course since he plowed his SUV into a tree and a fire hydrant outside his Windermere, Florida, home in the early morning after Thanksgiving in 2009, which led to revelations that he had multiple extramarital affairs. \n \n A police report then showed that a Florida trooper who suspected Woods was driving under the influence sought a subpoena for the golfer's blood test results from the hospital, but prosecutors rejected the petition for insufficient information. \n \n A witness, who wasn't identified in the report, told the trooper he had been drinking alcohol earlier. The same witness also said Woods had been prescribed two drugs, the sleep aid Ambien and the painkiller Vicodin. The report did not say who the witness was but added it was the same person who pulled Woods from the vehicle after the accident. Woods' wife has told police that she used a golf club to smash the back windows of the Cadillac Escalade to help her husband out. \n \n He eventually was cited for careless driving and fined $164. \n \n Woods and wife Elin Nordegren divorced in 2010.

The battle occurred less than three months after bin Laden had escaped at Tora Bora, and American commanders still hoped to capture or kill senior Qaeda leaders. \n \n Chief Slabinski\u2019s plan was to land by helicopter near the base of the 10,000-foot mountain around midnight and climb up stealthily, but a series of delays involving aircraft left no time to do that before dawn. Under pressure from superiors, he said, he reluctantly flew to the peak at about 3 a.m. \n \n Unbeknown to the SEALs, Qaeda forces were already there, and they hit the helicopter with heavy fire. One of Chief Slabinski\u2019s men, Petty Officer First Class Neil C. Roberts, fell out about 10 feet above the ground, and the pilot could not retrieve him before the stricken aircraft crash-landed a few miles away. \n \n Shortly before 5 a.m., the five remaining SEALs and Sergeant Chapman returned to the top \u2014 later called \u201cRoberts Ridge\u201d \u2014 on another helicopter to try to rescue Petty Officer Roberts. They did not know that enemy fighters had already killed and tried to decapitate him. \n \n The Americans were again met by a withering barrage. Rushing through thigh-deep snow, Sergeant Chapman charged ahead of Chief Slabinski, and they killed two fighters in a bunker \u2014 a hole dug in the ground under a tree \u2014 before the airman was wounded. \n \n Photo \n \n Under fire, the SEALs retreated about 15 minutes later. Chief Slabinski\u2019s plan, he said, was to take cover and let a circling Air Force gunship hammer the Qaeda fighters before trying again to seize the peak and recover Sergeant Chapman\u2019s body. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n But grenades and mortar fire drove the SEALs farther down the mountain, making it impossible to return. Three Army Rangers, an Army helicopter crewman and another Air Force commando were killed later that morning after arriving as reinforcements. \n \n Almost as soon as the guns fell silent, the accusations started to fly. Some Ranger, Army Special Operations aviation and Air Force special tactics personnel blamed the SEALs for their losses. \n \n Soon after, the military opened an investigation to determine what had gone wrong. The chief investigator, Lt. Col. Andrew Milani of the Army, wrote later that an Air Force gunship had failed to detect the militants on the mountaintop and that the SEALs had \u201cviolated a basic tenet of reconnaissance\u201d by landing directly on their observation post instead of hiking up to it. \n \n Colonel Milani also looked into footage captured by a Predator drone about 50 minutes after the SEALs had left the mountaintop. The grainy images showed someone in the bunker defending himself against two attackers and killing one with a rifle shot, prompting the question: Who was that? \n \n Colonel Milani\u2019s investigation remains classified, but an unclassified paper that he wrote in 2003 offered two possible explanations: The Qaeda fighters had become confused and were firing at one another, or Sergeant Chapman, still alive, had resumed fighting. The colonel did not reach a conclusion, based on the evidence he had. But the suggestion that members of one of the military\u2019s most elite Special Operations units might have, even unintentionally, left someone from another service to fight and die alone added to the tensions. \n \n Sergeant Chapman, a father of two daughters, in 2003 was posthumously awarded an Air Force Cross, a recognition of valor second only to the Medal of Honor, for his initial charge atop the mountain. The citation noted that Chief Slabinski, who received a Navy Cross for his actions in the firefight, had credited the airman \u201cunequivocally with saving the lives of the entire rescue team.\u201d \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

A former high school diving and soccer star from Windsor Locks, Conn., he transferred into the elite ranks of the Air Force Special Operations Command as a combat controller, a job that involved calling in airstrikes and handling radio communications for SEAL Team 6 and other secretive units. \n \n By the time he had joined Chief Slabinski\u2019s team in October 2001, he had spent more than a decade in Special Operations and, at 36, was expressing doubts about his ability to keep up, Chief Slabinski said. The chief told him that he had nothing to worry about. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n New View of a Battle \n \n Photo \n \n Sergeant Chapman was considered for the Medal of Honor when the secretary of the Air Force, Deborah Lee James, directed the service\u2019s Special Operations Command to review the seven Air Force Crosses awarded since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks for possible upgrades. She recently recommended the award to the defense secretary, whose approval is required before it goes to the White House. \n \n Pentagon policy forbids military officials to talk about potential Medals of Honor, but several officials, speaking only on the condition of anonymity, said that even the sergeant\u2019s initial bravery had stood out. \n \n Chief Slabinski said he wondered whether the Air Force was motivated as much by hopes of receiving its first Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War as by a desire to fully understand what transpired on the mountain. (Since the Sept. 11 attacks, 12 Army soldiers, three Marines and three SEALs have received the medal for gallantry in Iraq or Afghanistan.) \n \n A briefing prepared by Air Force special operations officials dismisses as \u201cnot viable\u201d Colonel Milani\u2019s suggestion that the gunfight caught on video by the C.I.A. Predator might have involved militants fighting one another, according to people who have received it. That the airman was alive and fighting \u201cis fully supported by the evidence,\u201d the briefing slides state. \n \n The use of the imagery-enhancement technology to scrutinize the Predator video was central to the findings, particularly when combined with footage, from an AC-130 gunship, that had not been available to Colonel Milani. As the drone circled more than 6,500 feet above the peak, trees and other objects impeded its view, and it had trouble staying locked on to the men in the fight. \n \n The imagery technology, still being refined in an Air Force lab, enabled the service to assign each person in the blurry videos a \u201cpixel signature\u201d based on his size, his clothing and the weapons he carried, people who have been briefed said. By identifying Sergeant Chapman shortly after he stepped out of the helicopter with the SEALs, the briefing slides say, its imagery analysts could follow him around the mountaintop, picking him up even when trees or other obstacles partly obscured him. \n \n Outside experts familiar with the technology said having video footage from the gunship as well as from the Predator drone would have provided the analysts with more tracking angles and clarity. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s two different eyes, and they could fuse that together,\u201d said David J. Kriegman, a computer science professor at the University of California, San Diego, who has done research in this area. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Based on the analysis, the Air Force believes that Sergeant Chapman was unconscious when Chief Slabinski thought he was dead. The sergeant regained consciousness and began engaging enemy fighters in three directions, the slides suggest. \n \n Photo \n \n The analysis suggests that Sergeant Chapman crawled into the bunker within 13 minutes of the SEALs\u2019 departure, or at about 5:25 a.m. Then, at 6:00, shortly after a rocket-propelled grenade was fired at the bunker, he fatally shot a fighter rushing toward him, according to the briefing. \n \n A few minutes later, another militant crawled to the bunker\u2019s edge, where, at 6:11, the airman killed him in hand-to-hand combat. \n \n As a Chinook helicopter carrying Ranger reinforcements approached, the Air Force contends, the sergeant rose up in the bunker for a better angle to provide covering fire. He faced machine-gun fire as he tried to relieve the pressure on the Rangers, whose helicopter was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade. \n \n It was only then, with rescue tantalizingly close, that two machine-gun bullets struck the right side of his chest, killing him almost instantly. The Air Force says his death was not captured on video. \n \n Presented with the Air Force analysis, Colonel Milani submitted an addendum to his paper. \u201cWith some of the original uncertainty removed, I can state that the probability now lies more in favor of Chapman surviving the original assault,\u201d he wrote. \n \n The Air Force\u2019s case includes a new analysis of Sergeant Chapman\u2019s autopsy that found that bruising on his forehead could have happened only if he had been alive, making the hypothesis that he had been briefly knocked out more plausible. \n \n His body, which was recovered later that day, had nine bullet wounds, five below his waist and four above. The sequence of the injuries is not known. But the two fatal rounds entered at what would have been an impossible angle had he been killed where the SEALs said he had fallen, according to people familiar with the Air Force briefing. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Lingering Questions \n \n A team led by the Air Force\u2019s 24th Special Operations Wing commander, Col. Matthew Davidson, briefed Chief Slabinski on the findings late last year. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything new,\u201d the chief said. \u201cIt was just presented differently.\u201d \n \n Photo \n \n Colonel Davidson said the Air Force could see Sergeant Chapman \u201cmoving in and around the bunker\u201d where he and Chief Slabinski had killed the two enemy fighters, the chief said. \n \n But because the bunker was under a tree that largely obscured it, this was not clear to Chief Slabinski watching the video. \n \n \u201cYou\u2019ve got these little flashes,\u201d he said. \u201cHere\u2019s a sliver of the pixel here, and then it kind of goes away, and there\u2019s another sliver of it, and here\u2019s some muzzle flash stuff.\u201d \n \n Chief Slabinski said Sergeant Chapman\u2019s assault rifle had been equipped with a suppressor to mask its muzzle flash, but the video showed the man in the bunker firing a weapon with an unsuppressed muzzle flash. \n \n The chief also questioned why the man shooting in the video appeared to fire on full automatic, rather than with the single aimed shots that the sergeant would have been trained to use. \n \n At times, Chief Slabinski said, he feels as if he had never left Takur Ghar. He still has \u201cvisions\u201d in which he sees fighters on the mountain moving in slow motion, and hears the sound of grenades and gunfire. He has trouble sleeping, and says he has received a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress after a dozen years of war. \n \n What stays with him the most is that morning he led his team into battle to try to save one man, only to be told later that he had left another fighting for his life. \n \n \u201cIs it within John\u2019s character to go on and do this? Without a question,\u201d the chief said. \u201cIf John did this stuff, I want him to get recognized.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 An incredible tale of bravery may have surfaced thanks to new \"pixel signature\" technology applied to 14-year-old videos\u2014but it's a complicated revelation. The New York Times reports those videos, shot by overheard aircraft on March 4, 2002, may show Air Force Technical Sergeant John Chapman fighting al-Qaeda militants and killing two while alone on a mountaintop in Afghanistan. What's so shocking about the footage is not just the bravery. It's that Chapman was supposed to be dead. He was originally there with members of SEAL Team 6, providing support as their radioman. In the midst of a fierce and disastrous operation, Senior Chief Petty Officer Britt Slabinski determined the men needed to get off the mountain. Slabinski couldn't verify the wounded Chapman was dead, but he was nearly certain. So a \"dead\" Chapman was left behind. The Air Force now suspects Chapman was alive for roughly another hour and tried to provide cover for a helicopter carrying Army Ranger reinforcements (three Rangers were among seven Americans to die that day; some say blame rests at the SEALs' feet). The conclusion comes thanks to technology that assigns those on the ground a pixel signature that can be tracked even when ground cover blocks a man from view. The Air Force secretary wants Chapman given the Medal of Honor; SEAL Team 6 has no issue with that, but hasn't taken a stance on whether Chapman was alive. Slabinski is outwardly skeptical, and suggests the Air Force would welcome a Medal of Honor, which it hasn't seen one of its own get since Vietnam. But a fresh look at Chapman's autopsy may provide further proof he was alive. Read the full story at the Times.",

    "document": "SEOUL Aides to the leaders of North and South Korea held talks at the Panmunjom truce village straddling their border on Saturday and into the early hours of Sunday, raising hopes for an end to a standoff that put the rivals on the brink of armed conflict. \n \n The meeting at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) village, known for its sky-blue huts and grim-faced soldiers, began soon after the deadline for North Korea's previously set ultimatum demanding that the South halt its loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts along the border or face military action. \n \n That deadline passed without any reported incidents. \n \n The envoys held discussions on how to resolve recent tensions and improve ties, the South Korean presidential office said in a brief statement. The talks which began late on Saturday broke before dawn on Sunday and the envoys will resume discussions later in the day, it said. \n \n An exchange of artillery fire on Thursday prompted calls for calm from the United Nations, the United States and the North's lone major ally, China. South Korea's military remained on high alert despite the announced talks, a defense official said. \n \n South Korean President Park Geun-hye's national security adviser and her unification minister met with Hwang Pyong So, the top military aide to the North's leader Kim Jong Un, and Kim Yang Gon, a veteran official in inter-Korean affairs. \n \n \"The South and the North agreed to hold contact related to the ongoing situation in South-North relations,\" Kim Kyou-hyun, the presidential Blue House's deputy national security adviser, said earlier in a televised briefing. \n \n Pyongyang made an initial proposal on Friday for a meeting, and Seoul made a revised proposal on Saturday seeking Hwang's attendance, Kim said. \n \n The North's KCNA news agency also announced the meeting, referring to the South as the Republic of Korea, a rare formal recognition of its rival state, in sharp contrast to the bellicose rhetoric in recent days. \n \n \"They need to come up with some sort of an agreement where both sides have saved face. That would be the trick,\" said James Kim, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. \n \n \"North Korea will probably demand that the broadcasts be cut, and they may even come to an impasse on that issue.\" \n \n BRINK OF WAR? \n \n North Korea, technically still at war with the South after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, declared a \"quasi-state of war\" in front-line areas and on Thursday set the deadline for Seoul to halt its broadcasts. \n \n South Korea began blasting anti-North propaganda, news reports and even entertainment over the DMZ on Aug. 10, days after landmine explosions in the DMZ wounded two South Korean soldiers. Pyongyang denies it planted the mines. \n \n Seoul said it would continue the broadcasts unless the North accepted responsibility for the blasts. \n \n \"The situation on the Korean peninsula is now inching close to the brink of a war due to the reckless provocations made by the south Korean military war hawks,\" the North's KCNA news agency said earlier. \n \n South Korean Vice Defense Minister Baek Seung-joo said on Friday Seoul expected North Korea to fire at some of the 11 sites where it has set up loudspeakers. \n \n The United States, which has 28,500 soldiers based in South Korea, said on Friday it had resumed its annual joint military exercises there after a temporary halt to coordinate with Seoul over the shelling from North Korea. \n \n The drills, code-named Ulchi Freedom Guardian, began on Monday and run until next Friday. North Korea regularly condemns the maneuvers as a preparation for war. \n \n Four South Korean and four U.S. fighter jets flew in a joint sortie over the South on Saturday, a South Korean official said, as thousands of South Korean villagers living near the border were evacuated into shelters. \n \n FAMILIAR FACES \n \n Pyongyang's two negotiators had made an unexpected visit to the South last October to attend the closing ceremony of the Asian Games, where they met Kim Kwan-jin, Park's national security adviser, who led the South's delegation on Saturday. \n \n North and South Korea have often exchanged threats over the years, and dozens of soldiers have been killed in clashes, yet the two sides have always pulled back from a return to all-out war. Analysts had expected the current crisis eventually to wind down. \n \n \"The fact that these powerful officials who represent South and North Korea's leaders are meeting means this is a great time to turn the crisis into opportunity,\" Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. \"It is a breakthrough.\" \n \n North-South ties have been virtually frozen since the 2010 sinking of a South Korean warship. Pyongyang denies any involvement. \n \n North Korea resumed its own broadcasts on Monday. On Thursday, it launched four shells into South Korea. The South fired 29 artillery rounds back. Neither side reported casualties or damage. \n \n North Korea has been hit with UN and U.S. sanctions because of nuclear and missile tests, moves that Pyongyang sees as an attack on its sovereign right to defend itself. \n \n (Additional reporting by James Pearson and Jack Kim in Seoul and David Brunnstrom in Washington; Writing by Tony Munroe; Editing by Nick Macfie and Robin Pomeroy) ||||| North Korea seems to be stepping up preparations for a military provocation even as ongoing high-level talks seek to avert the worst. \n \n More than 50 North Korean submarines have apparently been sent out on mystery missions, and artillery strength and warfare-readiness along the frontline have been raised to the max, a military source said Sunday. \n \n That suggests the North has embraced a two-prong strategy tempering its traditional brinkmanship with diplomacy. \n \n \"The current sortie rate of North Korean submarines is as high as 10 times the rate in ordinary times,\" a military official said. \"Scores of subs that have left their bases on the eastern and western coasts are off our radar, which is an unprecedentedly serious situation.\"",

It adds that although North Korean submarines\u2014described by the National Post as\" largely outdated and technically obsolescent versions produced in the 1960s for the Soviet Union\"\u2014make a lot of noise (meaning they should be easy to find), there are so many missing it would be hard to keep track of them all. Also worrisome, per the military official: North Korea has apparently doubled its number of artillery troops along the DMZ since Friday, per Chosun Ilbo. \"They seem ready to shoot,\" the official says.

    "document": "What would Donald Trump do to fix the Middle East? Listening to his prescriptions, it\u2019s not an easy question to answer. \n \n Trump sought to clarify his worldview with a prepared speech in Youngstown, Ohio, on Monday after a week of battles over his claim that President Obama \u201cfounded ISIS\u201d and was the \u201cMVP\u201d of the Islamist terror group. \n \n But setting aside the debate over that rhetoric, which he did not repeat in his speech, the national security framework he described was so contradictory and filled with so many obvious falsehoods that it\u2019s virtually impossible to tell what he would do as president. \n \n Trump\u2019s \u201cObama founded ISIS\u201d catchphrase is inflammatory, but it\u2019s not a literal argument (even though Trump initially insisted it was). Instead he's used the term to stitch together a patchwork of more mainstream criticisms that blame Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former President George W. Bush for creating the current Middle East crisis. \u201cOur current strategy of nation building and regime change is a proven, absolute failure,\u201d Trump said on Monday. \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Trump Proposes 'Extreme Vetting' Screening Process 1:59 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n Under Trump\u2019s telling, Bush committed the initial sin by destabilizing the Middle East with his 2003 invasion of Iraq. This is a version of events more common on the left, but one that exists on the right as well. \n \n Obama then made things worse with a \"reckless\" withdrawal of troops that created a \"vacuum\" for groups like ISIS to assert control. This is a frequent complaint from more neoconservative Republicans. \n \n In addition, Trump said, Clinton exacerbated the problem by supporting airstrikes against Libyan dictator Muammar Gadhafi's \"stable\" regime, which provided Islamic radicals another weak state to serve as a base. He also argued Clinton and Obama should have supported Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak, rather than encouraged him to step down in the face of street protests. These too are relatively ordinary criticisms. \n \n But these arguments, while unremarkable enough on their own, say nothing about Trump's instincts or how he would govern. \n \n That\u2019s because Trump previously supported every single foreign policy decision he now decries. \n \n Despite claiming daily that he opposed the Iraq War from the start, Trump endorsed deposing Saddam Hussein in a 2002 interview and there\u2019s no record of him opposing the war until after it had began. As for exiting the Iraq War, he said repeatedly in 2007 and 2008 that America should withdraw immediately and later recommended the same course for Afghanistan. \n \n Turning to Libya, Trump recorded a video in 2011 demanding the Obama administration remove Gadhafi from power on humanitarian grounds. He went on to lie about his support for the Libya intervention in a Republican debate only to admit to it when confronted with footage of his old statements in a CBS interview. Finally, Trump called Mubarak\u2019s departure \u201ca good thing\u201d at the time before turning against the idea years later. \n \n The result is that the only thing we know about Trump is that he\u2019s good at criticizing decisions by other presidents in hindsight. Unfortunately, this is not a very useful skill for the person tasked with making the decisions in the first place. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s best when he\u2019s making forceful retrospective critiques,\u201d Colin Dueck, a professor at George Mason University who\u2019s researched the history of Republican foreign policy, said when asked to describe Trump\u2019s worldview. \u201cBut when you ask him what specifically are you proposing going forward, he doesn\u2019t have a coherent proposal.\u201d \n \n As Colin Powell famously cautioned George W. Bush ahead of the Iraq War, \u201cyou break it, you own it.\u201d The consequences of military action \u2014 or inaction, in some of these cases \u2014 are irreversible. \n \n A 'Blathering Jumble of Nonsense' \n \n Trump\u2019s chameleon-like prescription for Middle East is not consistent with any one school of thought \u2013 or with itself. Sometimes he resembles a non-interventionist in the vein of Ron Paul, like when he decried nation building and regime change in his speech on Monday. At other times, he sounds like Genghis Khan, like when he demanded in the very same speech that American troops conquer oil fields in Iraq by force and claim the profits for America. He previously suggested in 2011 that the US claim Libya's oil as well. \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Donald Trump: 'We Should Have Kept The Oil' 1:18 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n \u201cIn the old days when we won a war, to the victor go the spoils,\u201d Trump said on Monday, describing a doctrine that runs directly counter to the international regime America led the world in establishing and currently enforces. \n \n The result of this confusing mix is that Trump has alienated Republican national security minds across a range of policy schools. \n \n John Noonan, who advised Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign on national security, said Obama\u2019s \u201cpremature withdrawal from Iraq\" was an avoidable mistake that contributed to the rise of ISIS and that Trump was accurate to point it out. But that doesn\u2019t mean Noonan is on board with the GOP nominee \u2014 far from it. \n \n \u201cThe rest of his foreign policy is an absolutely blathering jumble of nonsense,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience sign my name to it.\" \n \n In March, Noonan signed onto a letter with dozens of Republican foreign policy hands disavowing Trump in part because his policies are \u201cwildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle.\" \n \n Daniel Larison, a writer at the American Conservative, has spent years criticizing the Republican Party\u2019s foreign policy for leaning too hard on military operations to advance American interests. But despite Trump\u2019s stated opposition to \u201cnation building\u201d and toppling dictators by force, Larison opposes the nominee as well. \n \n \u201cTrump has relatively few antiwar conservative friends because he is not really reliably antiwar in any meaningful sense,\u201d Larison said. \u201cHe favors a much larger military budget, he usually has no strong objections to foreign wars when they begin, and he has little or no interest in diplomatic engagement that might avert conflict.\u201d \n \n Trump\u2019s views on intervention weren\u2019t the only place where things ran off the rails. Adopting a standard GOP talking point, he decried Obama for a mythic \u201capology tour\u201d on Monday and chided him for not championing feminism and gay rights abroad. \n \n But this is at odds with his stated views as well, which have long been characterized by a deep contempt for any notion of human rights that might impede raw material gains. In addition to celebrating torture and regaling audiences with apocryphal tales of Americans committing war crimes, Trump has regularly argued America\u2019s own leaders should refrain from criticizing dictatorial regimes because America lacks the moral authority to do so. \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Trump: 'I Think We Can Find Common Ground With Russia' 0:59 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n \u201cWhen the world looks at how bad the United States is, and then we go and talk about civil liberties, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re a very good messenger,\u201d Trump said last month when asked about concerns over a crackdown on opposition by Turkish leader Reccep Erdogan. \n \n Pressed on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe last year over his praise for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin despite allegations he\u2019s murdered journalists and rivals, Trump responded: \u201cI think our country does plenty of killing also.\u201d \n \n In 2013, Trump also lavished praise on Putin in multiple interviews for writing an op-ed that criticized the very concept of American exceptionalism. \n \n \u201cYou use a term like \u2018American exceptionalism,\u2019 and frankly, the way our country is being treated right now by Russia and Syria and lots of other places and with all the mistakes we've made over the years, like Iraq and so many others, it's sort of a hard term to use,\u201d Trump said on Fox News, adding that Putin was \u201cextremely diplomatic\u201d for pointing this out. \n \n 'America First' a Departure From GOP Philosophy \n \n Outside of the Middle East, Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy views are at least somewhat more consistent. He\u2019s long described international relations as a zero-sum gain between strong winners and weak losers in ways that apply to both national security and trade. Trump has consistently called for new tariffs to protect workers from foreign competition and he\u2019s cast a skeptical eye towards alliances like NATO, which he\u2019s threatened to abandon in recent months if member states don\u2019t pay enough for protection. \n \n Dueck compared Trump\u2019s perspective to the original \u201cAmerica First\u201d movement, which resisted foreign entanglements and sought American neutrality in World War II. \n \n \u201cTrump\u2019s actually been saying for decades that he thinks U.S. alliances are more of a burden than an asset, he\u2019s been saying for decades he against free trade deals like NAFTA,\u201d Dueck said. \u201cHe\u2019s very volatile and contradictory day to day but he has been actually saying this for years.\u201d \n \n All of this would be a major break from the last seven-plus decades of Republican and Democratic presidents. But at least American voters could fairly say they were warned if he implemented this approach. No one, probably not even Trump himself, knows how what he\u2019d do about the Middle East. \n \n Editor\u2019s Note: This story has been updated to reflect that Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that the U.S. claim Libya\u2019s oil fields was made in 2011, not during his speech Monday as first reported. ||||| Donald Trump\u2019s speech on Monday about the war on \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d was indifferently delivered and in many ways familiar. But there were some new elements \u2014 including an alarming suggestion that the Cold War offers a useful lesson in how to combat Islamic State. \n \n Again Trump said that he had opposed the war in Iraq; again he attacked President Obama for opening the way for (if not \u201cfounding\u201d) Islamic State by precipitously withdrawing U.S. forces from that country; again he disdained \u201cnation-building and regime change\u201d; and again he disparaged Hillary Clinton\u2019s work as the country\u2019s chief diplomat, this time adding the grace note that she lacked the \u201cmental and physical stamina\u201d necessary to deal with Islamic State. \n \n Trump also promised to \u201ctemporarily suspend immigration from some of the most dangerous and volatile regions of the world that have a history of exporting terrorism\u201d \u2014 the latest variation on his notorious proposal last year for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d There are too many immigrants coming in from the Middle East to perform adequate screening, he argued. But even if that\u2019s true, many of the terrorist attacks he cited in Europe and the United States were conducted by people who wouldn\u2019t have been subject to such scrutiny because they held European or American passports. \n \n Requiring assent to a checklist of values would punish thoughts rather than deeds and might encourage newcomers to dissemble about their beliefs. \n \n Trump said he would call for an international conference on halting the spread of radical Islam and described an alliance comprising NATO (which he claimed had decided to focus on terrorism at his suggestion), Israel, Egypt, Jordan and Russia. Never mind that something similar already exists under the imprimatur of the United Nations Security Council, although Russia seems more interested in propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad than in defeating Islamic State. \n \n More interesting \u2014 and alarming \u2014 was Trump\u2019s description of how he would combat \u201cradical Islamic extremism\u201d at home. Essentially, he would seek to promote liberal values, such as autonomy for women and tolerance for gays and lesbians, by adopting the conservative tactics of the 1950s. \n \n \u201cIn the Cold War, we had an ideological screening test,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe time is overdue to develop a new screening test for the threats we face today.\u201d Instead of excluding immigrants with communist views, he suggested, a Trump administration would bar immigrants \u201cwho have hostile attitudes toward our country or its principles \u2014 or who believe that Sharia law should supplant American law.\u201d (How he would test for such attitudes \u2014 and why those who harbored them wouldn\u2019t conceal them \u2014 went unexplained.) \n \n And where the House Un-American Activities Committee delved into the alleged disloyalty of Americans during the Cold War, Trump would establish a Commission on Radical Islam that would \u201cexpose the networks in our society that support radicalization.\u201d Trump said that \u201creformist voices in the Muslim community\u201d would be invited to take part \u2014 an invitation unlikely to be accepted. \n \n The goal of these initiatives, Trump suggested, would be to promote assimilation of Muslims and spare the United States the sort of alienation that has produced violence in Europe. What he apparently doesn\u2019t recognize is that Muslims are far better assimilated in America than they are in the European countries that have been victimized by Islamist terrorists. \n \n Obviously Americans aren\u2019t immune to the siren call of Islamist extremism; witness the attacks in Boston, San Bernardino and Orlando, all of which Trump mentioned. Screening of potential immigrants and asylum-seekers for possible connections to terrorism is a matter of common sense as well as national security. \n \n But ideological litmus tests for immigrants and a national commission to study \u201cradical Islam\u201d could be catastrophically counterproductive. Requiring assent to a checklist of values would punish thoughts rather than deeds and might encourage newcomers to dissemble about their beliefs. A commission designed to expose radicals could bring back the days of blacklists and guilt by association. These are frightening ideas. It\u2019s no surprise that they have been proposed by Donald Trump. \n \n Follow the Opinion section on Twitter @latimesopinion and Facebook ||||| People familiar with the immigration system say that many of Donald Trump's ideas will be nearly impossible to implement. | AP Photo Why Trump's immigration ideas won't work The Republican nominee's proposals appear nearly impossible to implement \u2014 and critics say they could actually fuel the terrorist threat. \n \n Donald Trump on Monday laid out some big plans to change the U.S. immigration system, calling for the suspension of immigration from regions that have \"a history of exporting terrorism\" and the roll-out of an ideological test to weed out foreigners who may support \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" \n \n The problem, people familiar with the immigration system say, is that many of Trump's ideas will be nearly impossible to implement. And some may wind up actually increasing the terrorist threat. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n The Republican presidential nominee unveiled the proposals during a speech in Ohio on national security. \"We should only admit into this country those who share our values and respect our people. I call it extreme vetting,\" the real estate mogul said, ad-libbing the \"extreme vetting\" line. \"Those who do not believe in our Constitution, or who support bigotry and hatred, will not be admitted for immigration into the country.\" \n \n Critics argue that Trump's plans are just a way to bar Muslims from the U.S., an idea he suggested months ago but which even some Republicans called an \"un-American\" religious test. (Trump also wants a ban on Syrian refugees.) Regardless of his true intentions, the basics that Trump proposed Monday left observers struggling to envision how they could ever become a reality. \n \n For instance, some asked, what does Trump mean by \"terrorism\" and \"regions\" with \"a history of exporting terrorism?\" Who counts as an immigrant \u2014 people who want to move to the U.S. permanently or the many millions who come as tourists, often without a visa? What counts as \"bigotry and hatred?\" And how will the ideological test be administered? \n \n Trump's proposals now are \"no more specific than saying you\u2019re going to screen out Muslims \u2014 it\u2019s less specific than that. In a way he\u2019s made his proposal less narrow and even vaguer than it was before,\" said David Bier, an immigration analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. \"Vague proposals rarely get implemented in any sort of specific, targeted way.\" \n \n Trump's team has promised more details in the coming weeks. As they figure them out, they'll face some tough realities. \n \n For one thing, there are few regions in the world not affected at some point by some form of terrorism. In Europe alone, Spain has suffered from attacks by Basque separatists the U.S. labels as terrorists, while Northern Ireland is still troubled by offshoots of the Irish Republican Army. Even if Trump were to focus purely on Islamist-inspired terror, that would still presumably include much of Europe, including France and Britain, most of whose citizens currently enjoy visa-free tourist travel to America. \n \n \"Are we calling for restrictions on visas to countries that have some of the best criminal justice and international policing programs?\" asked Greg Chen, a top official with the American Immigration Lawyers Association, in reference to Western European states. \n \n Then there's the Middle East, which is deeply scarred by terrorism but includes countries such as Jordan, Egypt and Israel, whose governments are important partners in the fight against Islamist extremists. Trump actually singled out those three countries in his speech, calling them friends \"who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished.\" But those countries \u2014 not to mention others \u2014 may resent seeing their citizens barred by the U.S. That could affect their cooperation on fighting extremists just as the U.S. is making headway in the fight against the Islamic State terrorist group in Syria and Iraq. \n \n \"Freedom of travel, whether regulated by visa or not, to the United States is a critical element of our relationship with these countries. It\u2019s a matter of dignity,\" said Jeremy Shapiro, director of research at the European Council on Foreign Relations. \n \n Trump also kept using the word \"region,\" but the U.S. immigration and visa policies are largely built around country-to-country relationships, and some countries don't clearly fall into one region or another: Turkey, for example, is a country that straddles Europe and the Middle East. \n \n U.S. immigration policy is incredibly complex and it is often affected by political decisions that seem questionable. For instance, earlier this year, the Obama administration imposed special visa restrictions on foreigners who have traveled in recent years to Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. But the administration chose not to include on that list Saudi Arabia or Pakistan, two countries notorious for producing terrorists, because the governments in Riyadh and Islamabad are, technically, allies in the fight against extremism. \n \n The U.S. government has very broad authority when it comes to deciding which foreigners it allows on its soil, and it does occasionally bar people, such as foreign government officials believed to be human rights violators. Historically, the U.S. also has barred people based on their beliefs, including in communism, a Cold War approach Trump alluded to in his speech. Legislative changes have made such ideological bans less likely today, but the rules are not black and white. Some experts assert that even if a Trump administration were to try to bar people based on their religion it may not technically be unconstitutional, even if it would seem to violate the spirit of the First Amendment. \n \n Constitutionality aside, the ideological test proposed by Trump poses challenges on a sheer logistical level, and could cost huge amounts of money to implement. Would the test come in the form of a questionnaire? Interviews with consular officers? The deployment of people to scour immigration applicants' social media accounts? \n \n And what counts as an un-American value? \n \n In his speech, Trump castigated radical Islamists for their hatred of gays, but would he argue that evangelical Christians from South Korea who also denounce homosexuality should be barred from visiting the United States? \n \n \"Immigration to the United States would grind to a near halt if millions of people are subject to background checks based on subjective criteria,\" said Cornell University law professor Stephen Yale-Loehr, who added: \"This proposal would also cost billions of dollars to implement. Business people and visitors could not be able to plan quick trips to the United States because they would not know how long an ideological background check would take.\" \n \n Trump on Monday also slammed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton for saying in the past that she wanted to see more Syrian refugees be allowed in the United States, warning that terrorists and criminals are hiding among the refugees (though Clinton has said refugees must be carefully vetted). But refugee advocates warn that Trump's comments only worsen America's reputation in the Middle East, spurring more young people to turn to Islamist extremism. \n \n Hina Shamsi, director of the National Security Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, said that, despite the change in language, Trump's overall goal appears to still be keeping out Muslims. She believes that would be unconstitutional. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how these proposals do not pose significant legal, policy and practical hurdles, and rightly so,\u201d she said. ||||| A HEAVILY trailed speech by Donald Trump on counter-terrorism, delivered in Ohio on August 15th, included little that made sense as a plan for keeping America safe, but offered some fresh insights into the self-obsessed, fact-scorning temperament of the businessman who wants to hold the world\u2019s most powerful job. \n \n As his poll numbers slide and the murmuring from his allies grows in volume, Mr Trump increasingly sounds like someone with a political version of Tourette\u2019s Syndrome. Much of the speech could have been given by any of the 16 Republicans that the businessman defeated for the party\u2019s presidential nomination, amounting to a committee-drafted recital of conventional conservative talking points. A subdued Mr Trump, reading from a teleprompter, dutifully accused Barack Obama of staging a blame-America \u201cglobal apology tour\u201d after taking office in 2009, and\u2014together with his first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton\u2014of destabilising the world by coddling tryants and snubbing allies, while refusing to take seriously the threat from Islamic terrorism. \n \n But every now and then Mr Trump sensed an opportunity to boast about how prescient he had been in his assessment of foreign affairs, even as a private businessman with no seat in the councils of state, and began shouting about some of his favourite ideas, and how clever they were. Rather often this required brutalising the historical record. In his Ohio speech Mr Trump claimed, falsely, to have opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq from the very start, then called Mr Obama \u201cincompetent\u201d for withdrawing troops too fast from Iraq. He scolded the \u201cObama-Clinton group\u201d for toppling the Qaddafi regime in Libya (though he actually praised that overthrow at the time). Mr Trump simultaneously grumbled that the Obama administration had both betrayed Reaganite ideas about freedom, and naively thought that democracy could ever be brought to such countries as Iraq. \n \n The foreign policy speech had been billed as a chance for Mr Trump to show that he has sober, workable ideas for fighting the Islamic State (IS) terror network. The property developer ploughed through some proposals that ranged from policies already in place, such as drone strikes on terrorist leaders, to ideas that seemed to bore him as he read them out, such as a presidential commission on radical Islam, including moderate Muslims, which would craft new protocols on tackling extremism for use by local police departments. Bowing to off-stage pressure from Republican bigwigs, he backed away from his earlier, unconstitutional talk of banning Muslims from entry to America. Instead, he offered a plan for what he called \u201cextreme, extreme vetting\u201d of immigrants, reviving ideological screening tests last seen during the Cold War, under which consular officials and immigration officers would somehow identify those with \u201chostile attitudes\u201d towards America and its values; anyone who believes that Sharia law should \u201csupplant American law\u201d; or any arrivals who do not \u201cbelieve in the constitution or who support bigotry and hatred\u201d; and ensure that visas only go to those \u201cwho we expect to flourish in our country.\u201d To that end, once elected president he would ask the State Department and Department of Homeland Security to draw up a list of regions where \u201cadequate screening\u201d is not possible, and he would suspend immigration from dangerous regions with a \u201chistory of exporting terrorism.\u201d \n \n He sounded much more excited when his text gave him the chance to engage in personal abuse, accusing Mrs Clinton of wanting to be \u201cAmerica\u2019s Angela Merkel\u201d, claiming that the German chancellor has allowed \u201cmassive immigration\u201d bringing \u201ccatastrophe\u201d to her country. Mr Trump sounded even happier when peddling conspiracy theories, as when he flatly declared that Mrs Clinton \u201clacks the mental and physical stamina\u201d to take on IS \u201cand every other challenge we face.\u201d He sounded happiest of all when he congratulated himself for his idea that America should have seized Iraqi oilfields (while shunning all other forms of nation-building in Iraq), leaving behind American troops to guard this war booty. \u201cI said: \u2018keep the oil, keep the oil, keep the oil, don\u2019t let somebody else get it\u2019,\u201d Mr Trump said, adding: \u201cIn the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils.\u201d \n \n The audience in Ohio liked some bits of Mr Trump\u2019s speech, as when he promised to dismantle terror networks in America \u201cviciously if necessary\u201d. His supporters were quiet through one of the few passages that amounted to a foreign-policy strategy that Mr Trump could realistically deliver as president, possibly because it was a fresh statement of his desire to forge closer links with the authoritarian government of Russia led by President Vladimir Putin, and \u201cfind common ground\u201d in the fight against IS and in Syria policy. \n \n A short while before Mr Trump\u2019s speech, Hillary Clinton, campaigning in the scrappy, blue-collar city of Scranton, Pennsylvania, preemptively mocked her rival for taking so long to reveal his counter-terror plans, saying that his secret is that \u201che has no plan\u201d. Mrs Clinton was joined in Scranton by the vice-president, Joe Biden, who condemned Mr Trump\u2019s praise for authoritarian leaders, saying that the businessman \u201cwould have loved Stalin\u201d, and joked that Mrs Clinton had forgotten more than Mr Trump and his entire foreign policy staff ever knew about geopolitics. \n \n Real Cold War veterans may be forgiven for finding the 2016 election a little odd. The party of Eisenhower and Reagan has nominated a man who calls looting of foreign assets the highest priority for America in war, and who sucks up to Russia. The Democrats are running on their candidate\u2019s national-security credentials. Meanwhile Mr Trump\u2014judged simply as a man standing on a stage\u2014sounds angrier and unhappier every day. This election is not about to grow more inspiring. ||||| WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump says that as president he would end \"our current strategy of nation-building and regime change\" because they don't work. His dislike for nation-building is shared by many, including none other than the target of his criticism, President Barack Obama. \n \n In fact it was Obama's predecessor, Republican George W. Bush, who committed the U.S. to large-scale nation-building projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama discarded that strategy while trying to keep enough U.S. influence there to prevent those two countries from crumbling. Obama's approach may not have worked, but it's not Bush-like \"nation-building.\" \n \n And while the Republican presidential nominee argued against nation-building in a foreign policy speech Monday, he advocated for something even more grandiose: seizing Iraq's oil wealth in the aftermath of the U.S. invasion in 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein. \n \n \"I have long said that we should have kept the oil in Iraq,\" he said in Youngstown, Ohio. \"I said, 'Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Keep the oil. Don't let somebody else get it.'\" It would have required U.S. troops to protect the oil, he said, but the benefit would have been clear today. \n \n \"If we had controlled the oil like I said we should, we could have prevented the rise of ISIS in Iraq, both by cutting off a major source of funding and through the presence of U.S. forces necessary to safeguard the oil and vital infrastructure products necessary for us to have the oil.\" \n \n Rather than nation-building, this would have been nation-grabbing, making Iraq a de-facto American colony. \n \n In the final months of his administration, Bush negotiated an agreement with the Iraqi government that called for all U.S. troops to leave the country by December 2011. Obama stuck to that schedule, believing that the Iraqis needed to stand on their own while the U.S. turned its attention to other pressing needs at home and abroad, what he called \"nation building at home.\" Obama, supported by his first secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, saw Bush's nation-building effort as a proven failure. \n \n Iraqi politics, however, never overcame sectarian divisions, undermining the Iraqi army and leaving an easy target for IS. \n \n Trump is right that the Islamic State capitalized on the political and security vacuum in Iraq in 2014, but it's not clear that a long-term U.S. military occupation to hold and exploit Iraqi's oil resources would have led to a more stable outcome. \n \n Trump says he would have used money from the sale of Iraqi oil to pay for the care of wounded soldiers and the families of those Americans killed in the war. \n \n \"This proposal by its very nature would have left soldiers in place of our assets,\" he said. \"We would have had soldiers there guarding this valuable supply of oil. In the old days, when we won a war, to the victor belonged the spoils.\" \n \n After major military victories, the 240-year-old United States has tended to pour money and aid back into countries it has fought to help re-establish governments and services. It was, in fact, a kind of nation-building approach. The U.S. still has troops in Germany and Japan, with the permission of those nations, but it never confiscated their natural resources. \n \n In his speech, Trump said that as president he would discard \"nation-building.\" In its place would be what he called a new approach, which he described simply as halting the spread of \"radical Islam.\" He said that if elected he would convene an international conference on the topic and work closely with Israel, Jordan, Egypt, Russia, the NATO alliance and \"all others who recognize this ideology of death that must be extinguished.\" \n \n Trump also called Monday for \"extreme\" ideological vetting of immigrants seeking admission to the United States, vowing to significantly overhaul the country's screening process and block those who sympathize with extremist groups or don't embrace American values. \n \n \"Those who do not believe in our Constitution, or who support bigotry and hatred, will not be admitted for immigration into our country,\" Trump said. \"Only those who we expect to flourish in our country \u2014 and to embrace a tolerant American society \u2014 should be issued visas.\" \n \n Trump's proposals were the latest version of a policy that began with his unprecedented call to temporarily bar foreign Muslims from entering the country \u2014 a religious test that was criticized across party lines as un-American. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Lolita C. Baldor contributed to this report.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Donald Trump delivered what one analyst calls a \"surprisingly serious\" speech on foreign policy and counterterrorism Monday\u2014but serious may not equal coherent. Many analysts were taken aback by the mix of proposals in the speech, which included policies favored by the Obama and George W. Bush administrations, along with ideas dating back to the Cold War and some touches that were pure Trump. A roundup of reactions: Some elements of Trump's speech on the war on \"radical Islamic terrorism\" were familiar, but what was new was \"alarming,\" according to the Los Angeles Times editorial board. His calls for a Cold War-style \"ideological screening test\" and a Commission on Radical Islam could be \"catastrophically counterproductive,\" they write\u2014and \"would punish thoughts rather than deeds,\" as well as encourage newcomers to the US to conceal their beliefs. Former Bush administration official Peter Feaver tells the New York Times that he gives Trump credit for the \"surprisingly serious\" speech, but a striking amount of it \"depends on counterterrorism ideas developed by the Bush administration.\" The \"good parts are not new,\" and \"the new parts are not good,\" he says. Robert Burns at the AP believes there was a lot more Obama than Bush in Trump's disdain for nation-building. Obama ditched Bush's large-scale projects in Iraq and Afghanistan while \"trying to keep enough US influence there to prevent those two countries from crumbling,\" he writes, noting that Trump's argument that the US should have seized Iraq's oil isn't nation-building, it's \"nation-grabbing.\" John Noonan, Jeb Bush's former national security adviser, tells NBC News that Trump is completely correct about Obama's contribution to the rise of ISIS, and not much else. \"The rest of his foreign policy is an absolutely blathering jumble of nonsense,\" he says. \"I can't in good conscience sign my name to it.\" At Politico, Nahal Toosi looks at the \"extreme vetting\" proposal that has replaced Trump's ban on Muslim immigration and finds numerous problems. She notes that focusing on regions with a \"history of exporting terrorism\" would include much of Europe, even if only Islamist-inspired terrorism is included. Trump seemed bored by much of his own speech and only seemed excited when congratulating himself on his prescience or accusing Hillary Clinton of \"wanting to be 'America's Angela Merkel,'\" per the Lexington column at the Economist. The article notes that real Cold War veterans will find this election very strange. \"The party of Eisenhower and Reagan has nominated a man who calls looting of foreign assets the highest priority for America in war, and who sucks up to Russia,\" it says. Glenn Kessler at the Washington Post is equally scathing in his fact-checking of the speech. Kessler debunks claims, including the notion of an Obama \"apology tour\" in 2009, and notes that Trump was not an outspoken opponent of the Iraq War until well after it began\u2014and that he has apparently forgotten that he \"was a fervent advocate of intervening in Libya.\"",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Donald Trump's foreign policy speech Monday was billed as an attempt to clarify what he would do as president. Here's what the pundits are saying: \"Trump sought to clarify his worldview with a prepared speech in Youngstown, Ohio, on Monday after a week of battles over his claim that President Obama 'founded ISIS' and was the 'MVP' of the Islamist terror group,\" writes Chris Cillizza at the Washington Post. \"But setting aside the debate over that rhetoric, which he did not repeat in his speech, the national security framework he described was so contradictory and filled with so many obvious falsehoods that it's virtually impossible to tell what he would do as president.\" \"Trump's 'Obama founded ISIS' catchphrase is inflammatory, but it's not a literal argument (even though Trump initially insisted it was). Instead he's used the term to stitch together a patchwork of more mainstream criticisms that blame Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former President George W. Bush for creating the current Middle East crisis,\" writes Cillizza. \"Our current strategy of nation building and regime change is a proven, absolute failure.\" \"He's best when he's making forceful retrospective critiques,\" a professor at George Mason University tells NBC News. \"But when you ask him what specifically are you proposing going forward, he doesn't have a coherent proposal.\" \"Trump has alienated Republican national security minds across a range of policy schools,\" writes Matthew Yglesias at Vox. \"Sometimes he resembles a non-interventionist in the vein of Ron Paul.\" \"He sounds like a non-interventionist,\" writes Yglesias. \"Trump's a mix of Republican foreign policy, which he's Youngstown.",

    "document": "It reads like a bad spy thriller. Between November 2016 and October 2017, a strange illness afflicted 24 diplomatic staff members working at the U.S. embassy in Havana, Cuba. Employees reported symptoms such as headaches, confusion, hearing loss. They talked about hearing strange sounds, triggering speculation the Cubans were employing a new acoustic weapon to harass embassy employees. Other scientists dismissed the idea of a sonic weapon as impractical. \n \n On September 1 science reporter William Broad jumped into this morass with a long article in The New York Times. His theory: the Cubans were employing a microwave weapon against U.S. embassy employees, causing sonic delusions and \u201cvery real brain damage\u201d. He based his theory on the microwave auditory effect, in which pulses of microwave energy of the sort emitted by radar elicits auditory sensations in exposed individuals. \n \n As the scientist who first proposed the now-accepted explanation of the effect in my 1974 Science article, I find the theory wildly implausible. To elicit auditory sensations, individuals must be exposed to intense but brief (microsecond) pulses of microwave energy. The pulses are sufficient to heat brain tissue by a few microdegrees in a few microseconds, and the resulting thermal expansion launches an acoustic wave in the brain that the subject perceives as sound. The acoustic pressures are many orders of magnitude too weak to cause tissue damage. They elicit audible sensations only because of the exquisite sensitivity of the human auditory system, and represent a near-threshold hearing phenomenon. To actually damage the brain, the microwaves would have to be so intense they would actually burn the subject, which has never happened in any of these incidents. \n \n To induce such an effect, one could cobble together a device from a military radar set or a commercial microwave generator, such as the one I used in my original experiments, and then direct a beam at a distant target. But the difficulty of aiming the beam at a person\u2019s head some distance away would be daunting. You would have to know exactly where the victim\u2019s head is located. You could use a much higher power radar such as that used for airport traffic control and spray the beam over a wide area, but the equipment then would be very large and cumbersome. Microwave antennas could also be embedded within the embassy walls, along with some kind of aiming device, but they would be easy to detect. \n \n But why bother with a device that produces near-threshold hearing sensations? There are simpler ways to harass people if that is the goal. Even now, a year after the incidents were reported, the facts of the matter remain unclear. A follow-up medical examination of 21 of the affected individuals by a neuroscience group led by Doug Smith at the University of Pennsylvania (my colleagues, in fact) found equivocal evidence the individuals had sustained \u201cinjury to widespread brain networks\u201d. Neuroskeptic, a neuroscientist who blogs anonymously in Discover magazine, brutally reviewed the Penn study. The blogger and other critical scientists suggested the findings were statistical artifacts due to the many tests the Penn group employed on the subjects. Other scientists have argued psychological factors were involved instead. Taken together, the results seem too scattered to allow firm conclusions to be drawn. \n \n In October 2017 Josh Lederman and Michael Weissenstein from the Associated Press made recordings available of the sounds that the employees reported hearing. If those indeed were the sounds, that would rule out the microwave auditory effect where the microwave-induced vibrations exist only within the head. Chen Yan, Kevin Fu and Wenyuan Xu (of Zhejiang University and the University of Michigan) showed the sounds in the AP recordings are characteristic of those produced by the interaction of two inaudible ultrasound beams via an effect known as intermodulation distortion. Ultrasound is widely used in burglar detectors, room occupancy sensors and other increasingly common appliances, and some individuals report unpleasant audible sensations from such devices. Intermodulation distortion is increasingly being employed to jam microphones used to record concert music illegally or for eavesdropping. Yan and colleagues report ultrasound can be used for eavesdropping purposes as well, by picking up vibrations in objects produced by human speech. \n \n In short, it is reasonable to guess the sounds were inadvertently produced by ultrasound devices, possibly even spy tech, but without malicious intent against the embassy personnel. The incidents occurred about the time of the 2016 U.S. election, and the Cubans undoubtedly were desperate for intelligence about U.S. intentions. \n \n There is even a historical parallel to the recent incidents: In 1972 it became publicly known the Soviets had been irradiating the U.S. embassy in Moscow with low-level microwave energy from the 1950s through the 1970s. Neither side disclosed the reason for this. (A reasonable guess is the Russians were trying to disrupt U.S. listening equipment or to collect data from their own bugs in the building.) The media published hyperbolic stories about supposed attempts to harm the embassy staff, fueling a generation of speculation about microwave \u201cneurowarfare.\u201d \n \n We don\u2019t know all the facts about the earlier incidents or the current ones, and no government is likely to provide them. Much of the information available is distinctly anecdotal. The Times story is not \u201cfake news\u201d but the real facts of the matter may be quite different from those presented by its distinguished journalist. ||||| Havana (CNN) A Cuban government investigator looking into reports of mysterious acoustic attacks on US and Canadian diplomats on the communist-run island on Monday dismissed a US government theory that microwave weapons emitting concentrated beams of radiation may have been used in the incidents. \n \n \"If you look at the alleged events, there have been reports that there are several people in a room with thick walls and thick windows and only one person was targeted. This is a kind of weapon that doesn't exist,\" said Dr. Mitchell Valdes-Sosa, a well-known neurologist who is part of the Cuban special task force investigating the alleged attacks. \"It's science fiction, not science,\" he said. \n \n \"First, it was sonic weapons, now microwave. What's next, kryptonite?\" the investigator said in an interview with CNN at his research center in Havana, referring to an earlier theory that sonic weapons emitting high-powered ultrasound waves could have caused the injuries. \n \n Valdes-Sosa said researchers and investigators are working on a paper to rebut the microwave weapons theory. \n \n Previously, the government not only denied involvement in the attacks but cast doubt on whether they actually occurred. In June, Cuba's Foreign Ministry said \"political motivations\" drove the United States to withdraw its embassy personnel. \n \n Though a March report based on the examinations of 21 diplomats who served in Cuba didn't link the attacks to microwaves, the study's lead author, Douglas Smith, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Brain Injury and Repair, told The New York Times that US diplomats in Cuba and China likely suffered brain injuries and that microwaves are considered the culprit. \n \n Valdes-Sosa said for a microwave weapon to work it would have to been used at a close distance, and none of the diplomats reported seeing the alleged perpetrators. He said that Cuban authorities had investigated the report that one diplomat who suffered an apparent attack had seen a van speed off and that the vehicle belonged to a church. \n \n While the US has not directly blamed the Cuban government for carrying out the attacks, US officials said Cuba is responsible for safeguarding the diplomats well-being and that Cuban officials would likely know if a third government were responsible. \n \n But Valdes-Sosa said after more than a year of US, Canadian and Cuban investigations there was still no hard proof that any attacks actually took place. \n \n \"For an attack to have occurred you have to have a real victim. First the thing we are not sure is if all these people evacuated from Cuba are really ill or have suffered do something that happened to them,\" Valdes-Sosa said. \"Second, you have to have a perpetrator. Who would be interested? You have to have the opportunity.\" \n \n In a Sunday interview with CNN, Smith said microwaves are \"a main suspect\" in causing the diplomats' injuries, but ultrasound and infrasound were being studied as potential causes as well. \n \n JUST WATCHED State Department pulls employees out of Cuba Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH State Department pulls employees out of Cuba 02:34 \n \n \"It's almost like a concussion, but without a concussion -- meaning that they look like individuals who have persistent concussion symptoms but have no history of head impact,\" Smith said, describing the injuries and explaining that learning the cause is vital to determining the best means of preventing it. \n \n \"Just like we have ways to prevent people from having a concussion, you could think of maybe protecting your brain from these energy sources,\" he said. \n \n Most of the attacks came in 2016 and 2017, though there have been a handful of reported incidents this year as well. \n \n A senior administration official told CNN that investigators have torn apart buildings where diplomatic employees encountered the sounds but found no acoustic devices, leading law enforcement to believe that the injuries were the result of microwaves beamed from a nearby location and that the \"sounds\" were merely a means of masking the microwave attacks. \n \n This is only a theory, the official said, and there is no concrete evidence to back it. However, brain scans on the injured personnel showed changes that indicate damage, the official said. \n \n JUST WATCHED Trump: Cuba 'responsible' for diplomat attacks Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump: Cuba 'responsible' for diplomat attacks 00:18 \n \n In a statement, the US State Department on Sunday neither confirmed nor denied the possibility that microwaves were behind the diplomatic injuries. \n \n \"The health and well-being of our personnel remains our top priority,\" the statement said. \"The investigation into the origin of these symptoms continues. The inter-agency community is working diligently to determine the cause of the symptoms, as well as to develop mitigation strategies.\" \n \n Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier this year he was establishing a Health Incidents Response Task Force , led by Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan and including representatives from the departments of Justice as well as Health and Human Services. \n \n The task force will serve as the \"coordinating body for department and interagency activities, including identification and treatment of affected personnel and family members, investigation and risk mitigation, messaging, and diplomatic outreach,\" Pompeo said in a statement. \n \n The sophistication of the attack has led US officials to suspect a third country is involved, perhaps as retribution against the United States or Canada -- whose diplomats have also been targeted -- or to drive a wedge between those countries and Cuba. \n \n In August 2017, officials included Russia among a list of countries that have an adversarial relationship with the United States and that American investigators suspected might be involved. ||||| Thank you for your interest in spreading the word about Science. \n \n NOTE: We only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.

But now a pioneering scientist in that field thinks the idea\u2014based on a principle called the microwave auditory effect\u2014is bogus. Kenneth Foster is a professor of bioengineering at Penn who explained the auditory effect in a 1974 study. At Scientific American, he assesses what's known about the Cuban ailments and lays out why it's \"wildly implausible\" that microwaves are to blame. For one thing, any such weapon powerful enough to cause brain damage would almost certainly burn the victims, too, and that didn't happen. Instead, Foster suggests that a much simpler explanation is likely. \"It is reasonable to guess the sounds were inadvertently produced by ultrasound devices, possibly even spytech, but without malicious intent against the embassy personnel,\" he writes. Foster cites this earlier investigation from the AP revealing the sounds that the victims are believed to have heard, and he says the sounds are consistent with ultrasound devices interacting with each other. It makes sense to him that the Cubans might have been trying to listen in on Americans with these relatively common gizmos. \"The incidents occurred about the time of the 2016 US election, and the Cubans undoubtedly were desperate for intelligence about US intentions.\" A Cuban scientist, meanwhile, agrees that the microwave theory is far-fetched. \"First, it was sonic weapons, now microwave,\" he told CNN. \"What's next, kryptonite?\"",

The theory was based on the microwave auditory effect, a phenomenon in which pulses of microwave energy are able to cause auditory sensations in exposed individuals. In a blog post, the scientist who first proposed the theory in 1974 calls it \"wildly implausible\" and says it would be impossible to produce such an effect using a military radar set or commercial microwave generator. \"To induce such an effect, one could cobble together a device from a military radar set or a commercial microwave generator, such as the one I used in my original experiments, and then direct a beam at a distant target,\" writes Chen Yan. \"But the difficulty of aiming the beam at a person's head some distance away would be daunting.

    "document": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Both sides in the gay marriage debate agree on one thing: It's time for the Supreme Court to settle the matter. \n \n FILE- In this June 26, 2013 file photo, gay rights advocate Vin Testa waves a rainbow flag in front of the Supreme Court in Washington. Both sides in the gay marriage debate agree on one thing: It\u2019s time... (Associated Press) \n \n Even a justice recently said she thinks so, too. \n \n The emerging consensus makes it likely that the justices soon will agree to take up the question of whether the Constitution forbids states from defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman. A final ruling isn't likely before June 2015, but a decision to get involved could come as soon as the end of this month. \n \n \"I don't see a lot of reasons for them to wait,\" says Dale Carpenter, a gay rights expert at the University of Minnesota law school. \"You have almost no one at this point opposed to certiorari,\" the legal term for high court review. \n \n Officials in five states in which marriage bans were struck down by federal courts have rushed their appeals to the Supreme Court, in time for consideration by the justices when they meet in private on Sept. 29. Moving at breakneck speed, at least for the legal system, Indiana and Wisconsin filed appeals on Tuesday, just five days after the federal appeals court in Chicago struck down their state bans. The Chicago decision itself came just nine days after judges heard arguments, extremely fast for a process that usually is measured in months. Officials in Oklahoma, Utah and Virginia also have appealed to the Supreme Court. \n \n Adding to the momentum, the winners in all those cases \u2014 who typically want to preserve their lower court victories and would normally oppose Supreme Court review \u2014 want the justices to weigh in. As expected, so do the losers. \n \n In all, 36 states, encompassing both those that allow same-sex marriage and those that don't, want the justices to join the fray. Thirty businesses, including Alcoa, Amazon, eBay, General Electric, Intel, NIKE, Pfizer and Target, say the Supreme Court should extend same-sex marriage nationwide because the \"current patchwork of state laws causes employees justifiable uncertainty about how their employers and governments will treat their familial relationships.\" \n \n The range of cases seems to meet the standard set by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg when she predicted in an interview with The Associated Press in July that the court would not look for ways to avoid ruling on same-sex marriage, as it did for many years on interracial marriage bans. \n \n \"I think the court will not do what they did in the old days when they continually ducked the issue of miscegenation,\" Ginsburg said. \"If a case is properly before the court, they will take it.\" \n \n The speed at which gay marriage has moved through the courts stems from the Supreme Court's decision less than 15 months ago in U.S. v. Windsor to strike down a provision of the federal Defense of Marriage Act that denied a range of tax, health and veterans benefits to legally married gay couples. \n \n Since that decision, nearly two dozen judges have relied on Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion for the court to extend the Windsor decision to strike down state same-sex marriage bans in every region of the country. Only one federal trial judge, Martin Feldman in Louisiana, has upheld a state anti-gay marriage law. Elsewhere, two appellate judges have dissented from rulings in favor of same-sex marriage. \n \n \"We all know this is going to be decided one step up,\" attorney Monte Stewart said Monday in his court presentation in support of gay marriage bans in Idaho and Nevada. \n \n \"And we all know by whom,\" said appellate Judge Stephen Reinhardt. \n \n Reinhardt was referring to Kennedy, the deciding vote in the Windsor case and the author of all three major gay rights decisions at the Supreme Court stretching back to 1996. \n \n \"Justice Kennedy has built himself quite a legacy on gay rights issues,\" said the University of Minnesota's Carpenter, doubting that Kennedy would repudiate that legacy by casting a likely decisive vote against the right to marry. \n \n The Windsor decision expressly left open the question of whether states could limit marriage to a man and a woman, yet \"courts are all looking to the Supreme Court's Windsor precedent as the rule of decision for challenges to state marriage laws,\" Colorado and 16 other states that do not allow same-sex marriage told the court in support of the state appeals. \n \n Gay and lesbian couples can now get married in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Judges in an additional 14 states have struck down prohibitions but put the rulings on hold pending appeals. The federal appeals court in Cincinnati could issue a decision at any time affecting Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and Tennessee. Appellate judges in San Francisco heard arguments Monday over bans in Idaho and Nevada. \n \n The situation is strikingly different from the last time a state's same-sex marriage ban came to the Supreme Court \u2014 and that was only two years ago. Same-sex marriage then was legal in just six states. \n \n \"Talk about a journey. It's a movement that took a long time to get going, but it has really snowballed in the last two years,\" said James Esseks of the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents gay couples seeking to marry in Indiana, Virginia and Wisconsin. \n \n Then, supporters and opponents of gay marriage squared off over whether the justices should even hear the case. Opponents urged Supreme Court review, while supporters pleaded with the justices to stay out of it. After all, they had won what they wanted in the lower courts, the invalidation of California's Proposition 8. \n \n The court eventually agreed to hear the California case as well as the federal Defense of Marriage Act case. The justices issued a technical ruling in the California case that eliminated Prop 8 but left for another day whether same-sex couples elsewhere have a constitutional right to marry. \n \n The prevailing view is that day will soon arrive. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Mark Sherman on Twitter at: http://www.twitter.com/shermancourt ||||| Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images \n \n On Monday morning, the Supreme Court declined to review seven gay marriage decisions out of five different states. In each case, an appeals court had ruled that state-level gay marriage bans are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court's refusal to hear every case means that gay marriages can begin immediately in Indiana, Oklahoma, Utah, Virginia, and Wisconsin. \n \n The move is unexpected and somewhat bizarre. Most court-watchers, including me, assumed the justices would wait to make a move on gay marriage until a circuit court ruled that state-level marriage bans were constitutional, swimming against the tide. At that point, the Supreme Court would be presented with a circuit split, essentially forcing it to wade in. And since the 6th Circuit seems poised to rule in favor of anti-gay-marriage laws, the justices probably would not have had to wait long. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n It appears, however, that the justices were not eager to keep gay couples in legal limbo while they awaited the 6th Circuit\u2019s ruling. Instead, their move on Monday allows thousands of gay couples in five different states to wed legally. Should the 6th Circuit still rule against gay marriage, of course, the Supreme Court could take the case then. For now, however, the justices have rid themselves of the issue. ||||| That doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that the court refused to hear those cases altogether. It simply means that the justices haven\u2019t decided which, if any, of the cases they\u2019d like to review. Conventional wisdom suggests that the court is waiting for a circuit court to rule against gay marriage before revisiting the topic; at that point, the circuits would be split on the issue, and the court would be more or less forced to intervene. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg recently suggested as much, noting that, until a circuit court found gay marriage bans to be constitutional, there would be \u201cno need for us to rush.\u201d ||||| Justice The Supreme Court Just Quietly Made Marriage Equality The Law Of The Land In Many States CREDIT: AP Photo/Richard Vogel \n \n In a surprising anti-climax to one of the most important legal battles of the last several decades, the Supreme Court announced today that it would not hear several cases where federal appeals courts held that the Constitution guarantees same-sex couples the same marriage rights as straight couples. The announcement listed these marriage equality cases as part of a lengthy order listing the cases where the Court had denied review. The justices offered no explanation for their decision. \n \n As a practical matter, however, this decision not to hear these cases is an earthquake for gay rights. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which covers Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, refused to issue a stay halting its order favoring marriage equality. Although the Supreme Court later stepped in with its own stay order, that order provides that the Supreme Court\u2019s stay will \u201cterminate automatically\u201d if the Supreme Court denies review of the case. Now that the justices have done so, there should be no further legal barriers preventing marriages from beginning in those five states \u2014 although it is possible that there may be some delay before marriages may begin due to procedural steps that need to be taken by the judiciary. \n \n The Court also denied review in cases arising out of the Seventh Circuit, which covers Illinois, Indiana and Wisconsin, and in the Tenth Circuit, which covers Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah and Wyoming. It is likely that marriages will be able to begin quickly in those states as well \u2014 although it may be necessary for plaintiffs in some of those states to seek an order from a federal court requiring states that oppose marriage equality to comply with their obligations under the Constitution. \n \n One thing that should be noted is that there are still marriage equality cases pending before conservative circuits that could rule against equality. Nevertheless, the fact that marriages are likely to begin very shortly in the states currently subject to court orders will make it very difficult for the Supreme Court to reverse course \u2014 and retroactively invalidate those marriages \u2014 in a subsequent opinion. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

On Monday morning, SCOTUSBlog reported, the Supreme Court denied all seven petitions. \n \n Most commentators have assumed the Supreme Court would take one or more of these cases and (perhaps) conclusively determine whether the federal Constitution bars states from refusing to recognize same-sex marriages under state law. Yet all seven cases below had come out the same way. In all seven, lower courts struck down the challenged state laws, so there was no circuit split. \n \n Given the lack of a split, I do not think it is at all surprising that the court denied these petitions. (Indeed, coincidentally, I was planning on writing a post raising doubts about when and whether the court would take on a same-sex marriage case.) There are several more cases pending in lower courts, including some in which there are reasons to suspect the states will prevail. If so, the court will have a split to resolve, making a grant a sure thing. If not, and same-sex marriage advocates run the table, the court can avoid resolving the issue. \n \n Of course, on this issue, the real question is what Justice Anthony Kennedy thinks. Is he ready and willing to hold that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex marriage? Or is he still conflicted given his federalist sympathies? This may ultimately determine when or whether the court takes a case challenging a state prohibition on same-sex marriage and how such a case is resolved. \n \n UPDATE: Roberts Barnes reports for the Post here. How Appealing rounds up more news coverage. \n \n SECOND UPDATE: It\u2019s worth remembering that Justice Ginsburg remarked last month that there was \u201cno urgency\u201d to taking a same-sex marriage case. At the time she noted that some circuits, such as the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, had yet to rule. As Dale Carpenter reported here, there is some reason to think the Sixth Circuit might well uphold the challenged state laws barring recognition of same-sex marriages, even if on particularly narrow grounds. That case was argued in August, and an opinion is likely in the next several weeks. \n \n STILL MORE: Lyle Denniston explains here why most observers expected the Court to grant at least one of the petitions.",

Jarvis and Gray assured their support team on Saturday that they would continue their expedition when conditions improved, ultimately completing their epic journey during a small break in the adverse weather conditions on Monday morning. \n \n Upon arrival at former whaling station Stromness, Jarvis said: \u201cThese early explorers were iron men in wooden boats and while modern man mostly travel around in iron vessels, I hope we\u2019ve been able to emulate some of what they achieved. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that everyone has a Shackleton double in them and I hope we\u2019ve inspired a few people to find theirs.\u201d \n \n Jarvis\u2019s team had been attempting to replicate the famous expedition of British adventurer Ernest Shackleton, who was shipwrecked while attempting to cross Antarctica from coast-to-coast in the 1910s. After his ship sunk after being frozen in an ice floe, Shackleton and a small crew were forced to navigate dangerous waters and trek 51 kilometres over mountainous terrain to reach a whaling station and seek help. \n \n Shackleton was ultimately able to arrange the rescue of his crew members after they had endured almost five months of isolation in the harsh Antarctic terrain. Despite their struggle to survive, Shackleton\u2019s team did not incur any casualties and the explorer\u2019s intense mission to find help became a staple part of Antarctic folklore. \n \n Jarvis\u2019s expedition had already completed the dangerous crossing of the Southern Ocean before being stranded by the adverse weather. After resuming their voyage they faced a two-day climb through the mountainous region of South Georgia before completing their expedition. \n \n The expedition had endeavoured to recreate Shackleton\u2019s experience as authentically as possible, only using mountain-climbing gear and navigation equipment that the original team would have utilised in the early 1900s. Jarvis and Gray were resupplied at their position in Shackleton\u2019s Gap over the weekend by members of their crew, who were forced to use modern equipment in order to safely access their colleagues. \n \n Jarvis and Gray were the only remaining members of the original six-person team that set out on the journey. Several of their teammates were forced to withdraw from the expedition after contracting trench foot \u2013 a debilitating rotting of the feet \u2013 while on the 19-day sea voyage to South Georgia Island from the site of Shackleton\u2019s shipwreck. \n \n Jarvis, inducted as a Member of the Order of Australia in 2010, is a prominent environmental scientist that advises agencies such as the World Bank and AusAID on issues of sustainability and conservation. He recently completed another re-enactment of a historical Antarctic expedition, tracing the path of Australian explorer Sir Douglas Mawson\u2019s ill-fated 1912 voyage across the continent.",

Using only period gear and food, Tim Jarvis and Barry Gray had already completed a 12-day, 800-mile sea voyage in a wooden lifeboat from the site of Shackleton's original shipwreck on Elephant Island to South Georgia Island, but tough conditions forced four members of their crew to drop out. The journey then required a 32-mile trek across the island, over mountains up to 2,950-feet high, to reach on old whaling station, which is when rain, snow, and 45-knot winds forced the men to take shelter for 12 hours in a tent\u2014a modern tent with modern sleeping bags, notes Global Post, along with some extra food supplied by their modern support team. But today, Jarvis and Gray completed the arduous journey. \"There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that everyone has a Shackleton double in them and I hope we\u2019ve inspired a few people to find theirs,\" says Jarvis.

    "document": "It\u2019s been 31 years since May 31, 1986 \u2014 the last World Cup that didn\u2019t feature the United States. That\u2019s 11,456 days of progress for a sport that\u2019s come so far in a country that still hasn\u2019t fully embraced it. \n \n All of that gone. \n \n With U.S. soccer\u2019s dreadful 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago on the final day of CONCACAF\u2019s qualifying hexagonal for the 2018 World Cup, next summer\u2019s tournament will not feature the USMNT. No Christian Pulisic. No Tim Howard. No Michael Bradley. With that loss, the USMNT gave a nation the lowest point in its sporting history, and it\u2019s not really close. \n \n CONCACAF is a grind, but compared to the other qualifying regions, the 3.5 World Cup spots out of six teams mean that the United States should be a lock to qualify. When it beat Panama, 4-0, on Friday, the U.S. put itself in position to escape a lackluster qualifying round with a spot in the tournament. All it really needed to do was take care of business at lowly Trinidad and Tobago. \n \n They couldn\u2019t even do that. With no sense of urgency, USMNT players and coaches had to watch as their CONCACAF counterparts did them no favors. Four years after the USMNT saved Mexico\u2019s World Cup dreams, El Tri instead blew a lead to Honduras and helped seal the USMNT\u2019s fate. Costa Rica also blew a lead to Panama on a goal that shouldn\u2019t have counted and gave up a late winner as the U.S. decided to score-watch rather than take matters into its own hands. A mostly empty stadium in Couva, Trinidad and Tobago, felt even emptier on this night. \n \n It\u2019s really difficult to quantify how bad this loss was for U.S. Soccer. Sunil Gulati and Bruce Arena should both be gone. Tim Howard, whose last World Cup appearance was a legendary performance, will likely leave U.S. Soccer with the lasting image of his worst performance with the national team. As bad as things got for the USMNT, the possibility of missing the World Cup didn\u2019t actually seem real. It\u2019s that arrogance that likely brought the team to where it is right now \u2014 out of the World Cup. When U.S. soccer legend Alexi Lalas called out the USMNT, its biggest star, Pulisic, laughed off the attempted gut-check rant. \n \n But when it comes down to it, though, the sport of soccer in the U.S. is going to feel the lasting effects the most. Every World Cup is an opportunity to grow the sport on the biggest stage. \n \n Even the growth from 2010, to 2014, to now has been tremendous. A nation went crazy when Landon Donovan sent the USMNT into the Round of 16 with his late winner in 2010 (a loss would have meant an early trip home). A nation went crazy when John Brooks put the U.S. ahead against Ghana in 2014, as he ran around not fully processing what he had done. \n \n Those moments forge memories and make lifelong fans of the sport. It creates momentum that makes it possible for an MLS team to draw 71,000 fans for a regular season match. Those moments inspire a young fan to kick around a soccer ball rather than throw a football. Those moments make it possible for a 19-year-old wonderkid to break through into the next level of international stardom. \n \n That\u2019s not happening anymore. It\u2019s five years \u2014 at best \u2014 of the USMNT out of the forefront of American sports. All because U.S. soccer let 95 minutes of arrogance erase 31 years of progress. \n \n And that is truly a shame. ||||| Ashley Allen/Getty Images \n \n The United States Men's National Team lost to Trinidad & Tobago, 2-1, on Tuesday night and were eliminated from the 2018 World Cup as a result. \n \n There is plenty of blame to go around, including to a phantom goal that helped Panama jump the Americans in the standings, but the brunt of it should and will be placed on the players and coaches who underperformed for the better part of a year of CONCACAF qualifying play. \n \n The loss is devastating to the US men's soccer program, which had not missed a World Cup since 1986. But some executives at Fox Sports are surely just as upset with the result as coach Bruce Arena and his players. \n \n To win a bidding war with ESPN, Fox agreed to pay $400 million for the English-broadcast rights to the World Cup in 2018 and 2022. With the Americans eliminated from 2018 contention, those broadcasts are most likely significantly less valuable than previously imagined. \n \n If the US had made next year's finals, Fox would've gotten the chance to broadcast three group-stage games for the US side, with the possibility of more if the Americans were able to make a run into the knockout round. Instead, Fox will have to dig a bit deeper to find compelling storylines for American fans in the biggest tournament in the world. \n \n While there will still be plenty of interest in Russia 2018, it's no doubt disappointing to both American soccer fans and Fox that the US will not be a part of the competition. USMNT supporters had hoped that this World Cup would be a swan song for some of the stars who had brought so them much joy, including Michael Bradley, Clint Dempsey, and Tim Howard. It was also supposed to serve as a coming-out party and passing of the torch for the American wunderkind Christian Pulisic, the 19-year-old who scored the Americans' lone goal Tuesday night and who is clearly the future of the team's success if it's to have any. \n \n But rather than a final goodbye to beloved superstars and a grand welcome to the future of the sport, the American men's soccer machine will have to collect itself, lick its wounds, and figure out a way to recover. \n \n And for Fox's initial investment to be worth anywhere near what it had anticipated, the USMNT must find a way to figure itself out ahead of 2022. ||||| On the final day of World Cup qualification Tuesday, Argentina needed a win in Quito, the capital city of Ecuador, to advance to Russia. With everything to lose and a soccer mad country on pins and needles, the legendary Lionel Messi recorded a hat trick and Argentina was safe. \n \n It\u2019s crazy to compare Argentina to the United States because one country has the history and youth system to remain an international force. And we certainly don\u2019t have and perhaps never will have a player on the level of Messi. \n \n But the mission and the pressure were the same. And all Bruce Arena\u2019s team had to do was earn a tie against tiny Trinidad and Tobago to keep the USA\u2019s World Cup dream alive. \n \n And we failed. \n \n Spectacularly. \n \n A shocking 2-1 defeat to Trinidad and Tobago, the worst team in the final round of CONCACAF regional qualifying and already eliminated, means no 2018 World Cup for the Red, White and Blue next summer. No trip to Russia. No grand stage for Christian Pulisic. And no luck for Fox Sports, which paid a fortune for the television rights. \n \n It took 90-plus minutes for United States soccer to regress 30 years. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a blemish for us,\u201d U.S. coach Bruce Arena said. \u201cWe should not be staying home for the World Cup.\u201d \n \n The U.S. finished fifth in the group. CONCACAF sends three teams automatically to the World Cup: Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama. The fourth, Honduras, heads to a playoff against an Asian confederation team, Australia. \n \n It took 90-plus minutes for United States soccer to regress 30 years. (Ashley Allen/Getty Images) \n \n The political backdrop was impossible to ignore. Mexico gave up an 88th minute goal and lost, 3-2, to Honduras. A Mexico draw would have moved the U.S. into fourth place and a playoff with Australia. The United States needed help from Mexico. Imagine that. We didn\u2019t get it. \n \n But really, the United States has only itself to blame. A tie would have secured third place and spot in Russia. It wasn\u2019t asking much. \n \n \u201cWe had everything there for us today,\u201d Arena said. \u201cNo excuses for us not getting a second goal and at least a point.\u201d \n \n The U.S. was poor throughout qualifying. Jurgen Klinsmann was fired as coach 11 months ago after losing at home to Mexico and getting embarrassed, 4-0, in a loss at Costa Rica over a four-day stretch. Arena, who led the U.S. to the quarterfinals of the 2002 World Cup, was installed as head coach. But a home loss to Costa Rica, followed by a draw against Honduras, put the team in the danger zone. \n \n The U.S. last missed the World Cup in 1986. It clinched a berth in 1990 by winning at Trinidad and Tobago on the last day of qualification. That watershed victory sparked a growth for soccer in this country. Youth participation exploded, Major League Soccer started in 1996 and the popularity of the sport grew. \n \n Even our player development improved. The best example is Pulisic, the 19-year-old budding star who scored the lone goal after the U.S. had fallen behind, 2-0, in the first half. \n \n But we didn\u2019t have enough players to replace some of our aging stars. Tim Howard, a world class goalie five years ago, simply doesn\u2019t have it anymore. Clint Dempsey is no longer capable of playing 90 minutes. Michael Bradley has lost a step. \n \n And our center back play was abysmal. Poor Omar Gonzalez, burned last month for Honduras\u2019 goal, had his attempted clearance sail over Howard and into the net for an own goal. \n \n The U.S. last missed the World Cup in 1986. (Ashley Allen/Getty Images) \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s one that will haunt me forever,\u201d Gonzalez said. \n \n The fallout from this will be epic. Heads will roll. Arena is done. Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation, could be in trouble. \n \n Maybe the United States needed a major setback to move forward. Good teams, even great teams, have missed the World Cup. England and France didn\u2019t qualify in 1994. The Netherlands is out of the 2018 World Cup. Italy has to win a playoff to get in. \n \n But it\u2019s also much tougher to qualify in Europe. Same with South America. The United States has a geographic advantage, especially with the financial resources and population. \n \n The players are here. We just haven\u2019t discovered enough of them. And we haven\u2019t developed enough of them. \n \n It\u2019s time for a reboot. \n \n And now we have until 2022 to get it right. ||||| COUVA, Trinidad and Tobago \u2014 On the most surreal and embarrassing night in U.S. soccer history, the U.S. men\u2019s national team lost 2-1 to Trinidad and Tobago (the worst team in the CONCACAF Hexagonal) and was eliminated from contention for World Cup 2018. \n \n The doomsday scenario happened. \n \n All the U.S. needed to do to qualify for the World Cup was to win or tie. And they lost, a deserving defeat that ended a miserable qualifying campaign\u2014three wins in 10 Hexagonal games\u2014and will raise enormous questions about the overall direction of the U.S. Soccer Federation, the players and coach Bruce Arena. The U.S. loss opened the door to Panama and Honduras, which both needed to win to ensure the U.S. elimination, which was exactly what happened. Honduras rallied from two deficits to beat Mexico in San Pedro Sula, while Panama rode a controversial Blas Perez opener and a Roman Torres late winner to beat Costa Rica in Panama City. \n \n Here are three thoughts on the USA's ouster: \n \n The U.S. should be utterly embarrassed \n \n On a night when Arena\u2019s team had control of its own destiny, the Americans had one of the most infamous belly-flops in U.S. soccer history, losing to the already-eliminated Trinis with everything on the line for the United States. \n \n In a pitiful first-half performance, the U.S. lacked urgency and went through the motions while the hosts looked like the ones who had a chance to qualify for the World Cup. Trinidad and Tobago took a 2-0 halftime lead on an own-goal by Omar Gonzalez and a golazo from distance by Alvin Jones, and the U.S. response was tepid at best. This was a team with players acting like they thought they had already qualified for the World Cup, and it showed. \n \n Only one U.S. player had a decent game \n \n Christian Pulisic pulled one back for the Americans early in the second half with a laser from outside the box. Pulisic was largely bottled up otherwise, but at least he had one dazzling moment. His teammates could hardly say the same. Forwards Jozy Altidore and Bobby Wood were nonexistent. Wings Darlington Nagbe and Paul Arriola were invisible. Goalkeeper Tim Howard could have been in better position on both goals. And Gonzalez showed with his own-goal and what should have been called a penalty soon thereafter that he was a poor choice by Arena to be on the field, especially with Premier League starter Geoff Cameron on the bench. \n \n Tear it all down \n \n The far-reaching impacts of this colossal failure will be felt for a long time, not just by the figures on the field on Tuesday but also by the millions and millions of dollars lost by any number of stakeholders in the sport in the United States. The men\u2019s World Cup only comes around once every four years, and the missed opportunity to create millions of new soccer fans in the U.S. is a crushing blow. Missing the World Cup won\u2019t cripple the sport in the U.S., but it will be a huge step back for a sport that had been on the rise for a long time. ||||| So the U.S. men's national team failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup on Tuesday, but there is reason to believe they shouldn't have been eliminated. Panama beat Costa Rica 2-1 to clinch the final spot and send the U.S. crashing out, but the Panamanian's first goal didn't even go in. As to whether it can be appealed remained to be seen. \n \n CBS Sports reached out to U.S. Soccer about whether an appeal could be filed. Press Officer Michael Kammarman said in an email, \"As far as I know there is no recourse. Decisions of the referee are final.\" \n \n It all comes from Gabriel Torres's phantom goal that made it 1-1. You'll see here, the ball never crossed the line: \n \n Estados Unidos se queda fuera del Mundial por un gol de Panam\u00e1 que ni entr\u00f3 pic.twitter.com/k2JojPf7bq \u2014 Joaqu\u00edn L\u00f3pez-D\u00f3riga (@lopezdoriga) October 11, 2017 \n \n Shocking. No goal-line technology, and this is what happens. An unbelievable scene, and certainly unfair. Yes, there's the human error part in any officiated match, but what recourse does the U.S. have? Rules from CONCACAF say an appeal can be filed for \"parties directly affected by a decision\" and that there are 21 days to file it -- whether this would fall under that remains to be seen: \n \n Article 54. Jurisdiction of CAS (Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland) as an appeals arbitration body \n \n 1. As an appeals arbitration body, CAS shall be entitled to hear appeals against final decisions passed by CONCACAF. \n \n 2. Only parties directly affected by a decision may appeal to CAS. However, where doping-related decisions are concerned, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) may appeal to CAS. \n \n 3. The time limit for appeal to CAS shall be twenty-one (21) days from the receipt of the \n \n decision in question. \n \n 4. An appeal before CAS may only be brought after CONCACAF's or FIFA's internal \n \n procedures and remedies have been exhausted. \n \n 5. An appeal shall not have any suspensory effect as a stay of execution of a disciplinary \n \n sanction, subject to the power of CAS to order that any disciplinary sanction be stayed \n \n pending the arbitration. \n \n 6. CAS shall not take into account facts or evidence which the appellant could have \n \n submitted to an internal CONCACAF body by acting \n \n Now, it's certainly a long shot for anything like this to be overturned. CAS usually sees more cases about doping and was involved in CONMEBOL qualifying. The goal will almost certainly stand, but the U.S. would be wise to do whatever it takes to have its voice heard after this decision. It's the difference between the U.S. going still having a chance to go to the World Cup or sitting at home and watching it. ||||| The biggest failure in American soccer history is as complex as it is damaging. There is no one source, no single target for blame. The list of culprits exceeds five, 10, 20 and even 100. The building blocks of a national soccer team are nearly infinite. \n \n Every single one of those building blocks will be smashed to bits by criticism following Team USA\u2019s 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago, a defeat that eliminated it from World Cup contention. And rightly so. Much of the criticism is long overdue. \n \n Scroll to continue with content Ad \n \n But some of the blocks that will crumble are bigger than others. Some are massive. Here are the five most blameworthy culprits of a failure that touched every level of the sport in the United States, in descending order, beginning with the least culpable of the five. \n \n 5. Jurgen Klinsmann \n \n The former national team boss is far from the biggest culprit. But he\u2019s not exempt here. He dug the U.S. a qualifying hole with losses to Mexico and Costa Rica 11 months ago. \n \n But Klinsmann\u2019s faults were spread out over much more than 180 minutes last November. He ran the program into the ground with aimless tactics, a stale vision and constant ill-preparedness. He stunted players\u2019 development by playing them out of position, and generally didn\u2019t fulfill the promises he made when he took over as manager in 2011. \n \n Despite all that, though, his team cruised through qualification last time around, and outperformed expectations at the World Cup. His successor couldn\u2019t even get there \u2026 \n \n 4. Bruce Arena \n \n Arena, previously in charge of the national team from 1998 to 2006, was brought in to dig the U.S. out of Klinsmann\u2019s hole. And the odd thing is that, well, he did. He got eight points from his first four qualifiers, and had the U.S. in position to qualify with ease. \n \n Story continues \n \n Then it all went wrong. Horribly, painfully, catastrophically wrong. \n \n Not all of the wrongdoing was Arena\u2019s. In fact, not much of it was even when the U.S. picked up just one point from two September games against Costa Rica and Honduras. Those were primarily on the players. Perhaps all of this is primarily on the players. But more on them later. \n \n Arena cleaned up some of Klinsmann\u2019s mess. But he created messes of his own, and those messes caught fire in Trinidad. His close-mindedness when it came to squad selection \u2013 his outright refusal to even care about replenishing an aging squad \u2013 came back to haunt him. \n \n His lineup philosophies were also two-faced. He seemingly believed in rotation and freshness over consistency, which worked in Mexico City in June, and barely did again in Honduras in September. But then he stuck with an unchanged starting 11 Tuesday in Trinidad, presumably thinking he had found a winning formula. He hadn\u2019t. Instead, he found a tactically naive method to engineer the U.S.\u2019 failure. \n \n Tuesday\u2019s task was fundamentally different from Friday\u2019s in every possible way. On Friday, Arena went all-out attack at home with the U.S. needing a win against Panama. Understandable. On Tuesday, with the U.S. needing only a point in substandard conditions away from home, he inexplicably chose attack again over solidity and control. He effectively played three strikers and two wingers, leaving the U.S. disjointed as a unit. \n \n He also benched his best center back \u2013 a center back who played 90 minutes the previous weekend for Stoke City in the English Premier League, and who has been doing just that, and doing it well, consistently for a while now. With that center back, Geoff Cameron, sitting on the bench, the mistake-prone Omar Gonzalez made a horrendous error that ultimately cost the U.S. a spot at the World Cup. But he never should have been in that position in the first place. \n \n Arena had one job. He didn\u2019t do it. And he\u2019s now coached his last game with the national team. \n \n U.S. Soccer Sunil Gulati has his first contested election coming up in February \u2013 if he decides to run. (Getty) \n \n 3. Sunil Gulati \n \n It is impossible to shy away from criticism of the man who hired No. 4 and No. 5 on this list as well. The head honcho. United States Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati. \n \n His hires aren\u2019t the only issue. But they\u2019re the most easily identifiable. He had courted Klinsmann basically ever since the former German World Cup-winning striker managed his native land to third at the 2006 tournament on home soil. Gulati finally got him in 2011. It was an ambitious choice. A pricey one too. But it was probably always misguided. \n \n Nonetheless, Klinsmann performed somewhat admirably, at least initially. The issue was that the allure of his stature in world soccer was too much for Gulati to assess his performances accurately. The president, for some reason, rewarded his manager with a long-term contract extension before the 2014 World Cup, then clung to the coattails of a regime going backward for too long thereafter. When he did pull the trigger and axe Klinsmann 11 months ago, Arena was the right choice. The wrong choice was letting Klinsmann survive as long as he did. \n \n The wrong choices were also many other things. Gulati\u2019s presence in powerful positions has probably been a net positive for soccer in America. But, among other failures, one of them the mishandling of Klinsmann, he has not adequately invested in youth development. In the building blocks that allow a national team to sustain consistent success. He and the federation have invested in them, but haven\u2019t devoted enough attention to actually solving real problems. They are sitting on millions of dollars that could be used to address the problems. Those dollars haven\u2019t been used for that purpose. \n \n And Gulati himself could pay. A U.S. Soccer presidential election looms in four months. Gulati, for the first time, has challengers. There will be louder calls for change than ever before. \n \n 2. The players \n \n Gulati, though, didn\u2019t make defensive errors. Arena didn\u2019t misplace passes in midfield. Klinsmann didn\u2019t waste chances in front of goal. \n \n The players, in the end, are to blame for what just transpired. They were deserving of praise on several specific occasions. On the whole, they, as a collective, were sub-par. And then on Tuesday, they were worse than that. Far worse. \n \n Not all of them were at fault. Christian Pulisic is and was special. Michael Bradley carried a massive burden and handled it fairly well. But the rest \u2026 most of them were mediocre at best. Jozy Altidore was too inconsistent. The back four were disorganized and generally underwhelming, whoever the four were. Darlington Nagbe didn\u2019t live up to his creative billing. Tim Howard made several mistakes throughout the Hex, and in his prime might have kept out both of Tuesday\u2019s goals. \n \n The players did not perform up to the standard expected of them. At times, circumstances could be used as legitimate excuses. But none of them excuse 12 points from 10 games against mostly inferior opposition. \n \n The natural follow-up question, then, is this: Did the players underperform? Or are they simply not good enough? \n \n 1. A broken system \n \n The answer is both. The second item on this list speaks to the underperformance. The first, this one, speaks to the inadequacy. \n \n The U.S. player pool is strong. Stronger than it was two decades ago. But the obvious point is the broad one: That player pool is nowhere near what a nation of 325 million should be able to produce. The reasons for this are deep-seated and poisonous. \n \n The main one is the youth soccer model that was established in the U.S. decades ago. Whereas talented young players in many other countries are given scholarships to soccer academies, the vast majority of children in the U.S. \u201cpay to play.\u201d This slashes the size of the player pool into a fraction of what it could be, because kids from low-income families can\u2019t afford the hefty registration fees and travel-related costs. Elite coaching eludes them. The issue is far too complex for this forum, but it\u2019s a major hindrance. \n \n Talent identification and youth coaching have also been severely lacking. Scouting efforts ignore many under-served communities. Potential pros slip through the cracks at young ages. In many cases, kids aren\u2019t educated properly, because they\u2019re taught by teammates\u2019 dads who don\u2019t know the game. The kids, therefore, don\u2019t develop the most relevant and applicable skills. Again, the root causes are impossible to explain in two paragraphs. But they\u2019ve plagued the U.S. for years. \n \n The symptoms of the problems are easier to explain. As American Soccer Now\u2019s Brian Sciaretta explored just last week, there is a glaring gap in the age profile of the current U.S. squad. There are talented youngsters and accomplished veterans. But the 23-27 age range \u2013 made up of players born in the years 1990-1994, players who came through the system before youth development reform truly took effect \u2013 is alarmingly bereft. A generation of players that should be spearheading the national team is absent. \n \n The \u201cMissing Years,\u201d as Sciaretta called them, more than anything else, explain why the U.S. shockingly couldn\u2019t beat Trinidad and Tobago, a nation 1/230 its size. With MLS academies growing, other revamped youth systems producing and problems gradually \u2013 very gradually; too gradually \u2013 being addressed, this won\u2019t happen again. Or at least it shouldn\u2019t. \n \n But the failures in scouting and coaching have left a massive hole in the men\u2019s national team. A hole that not even Klinsmann could dig. And one that the U.S. finally tripped into Tuesday in Trinidad. \n \n \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \n \n Henry Bushnell covers soccer \u2013 the U.S. national teams, the Premier League, and much, much more \u2013 for FC Yahoo and Yahoo Sports.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The short version is easy enough: Trinidad and Tobago upset the US Mens National Team in soccer Tuesday night, and the 2-1 loss means that the Americans won't qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986. But just how bad a loss is this? The defeat is \"the most surreal and embarrassing night in US soccer history,\" writes Grant Wahl for Sports Illustrated. \"Unthinkable,\" declares the New York Times. \"With that loss, the USMNT gave a nation the lowest point in its sporting history, and it\u2019s not really close,\" writes Andrew Joseph for USA Today. \"It took 90-plus minutes for United States soccer to regress 30 years,\" writes Frank Isola at the Daily News. The kicker is that two other games fell the wrong way in unexpected fashion, one on a \"phantom goal,\" sealing the US fate. Honduras rallied from two goals down to beat Mexico, and Panama rallied from one goal back to beat Costa Rica. Had either of those games gone the other way, or had the US even tied Trinidad and Tobago (which had previously been eliminated from qualifying), the Americans would have secured a spot in Russia for the 2018 competition. Of note: Phantom goal: The winning goal scored by Panama against Costa Rica didn't cross the goal line, per CBS Sports, which has video here. The story raises the faint hope that the US could appeal the goal ruling, but it seems unlikely. \"As far as I know, there is no recourse,\" says a US soccer official. Pity Fox Sports: The network paid $200 million, outbidding ESPN, for the rights to televise the 2018 World Cup and showcase teen phenom Christian Pulisic, notes Business Insider. It's now going to be tough for that investment to pay off. Five culprits: Yahoo Sports looks at what went wrong in the US game, and why Bruce Arena has almost certainly coached his last game for the team.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The US men's national soccer team is out of the World Cup for the first time in a quarter-century after a 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago on Tuesday night. The loss means the US won't be in Russia next year for the first time since 1986. Here's what people are saying: \"It's really difficult to quantify how bad this loss was for US Soccer,\" writes Chris Jones at Bleacher Report. \"It's 11,456 days of progress for a sport that's come so far in a country that still hasn't fully embraced it. All of that gone.\" The US needed to beat Trinidad and Tobago and have Costa Rica tie with Panama to advance. Instead, it blew a lead and gave up a late goal. \"It's that arrogance that likely brought the team to where it is right now\u2014out of the World Cup,\" writes Jones. \"Every World Cup is an opportunity to grow the sport on the biggest stage. Even the growth from 2010, to 2014, to now has been tremendous. A nation went crazy when Landon Donovan sent the USMNT into the Round of 16 with his late winner in 2010 (a loss would have meant an early trip home). A nation went crazy when John Brooks put the US ahead against Ghana in 2014, as he ran around not fully processing what he had done. Those moments inspire a young fan to kick around a soccer ball rather than throw a football. Those moments make it possible for a 19-year-old wonderkid to break through into the next level of international stardom. That's not happening anymore. Fox, which had the rights to broadcast three group-stage games, is likely to lose its broadcasting the US's chance to broadcast a compelling storylines to find compelling storylines.",

    "document": "Two police reports written the night that George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin said that Zimmerman had a bloody face and nose, according to police reports made public today. \n \n The reports also note that two witness accounts appear to back up Zimmerman's version of what happened when they describe a man on his back with another person wearing a hoodie straddling him and throwing punches. \n \n It has been such a contentious case that even the evidence is being disputed. \n \n The police report states that Trayvon Martin's father told an investigator after listening to 911 tapes that captured a man's voice frantically callling for help that it was not his son calling for help. \n \n But Tracy Martin, Trayvon's father, claims that is not true. The Martin family lawyer Ben Crump told ABC News that Tracy Martin initially listened to a distorted version of the 911 calls and said he could not identify the voice. But when he listened to a second tape that had been \"cleaned,\" \"He immediately broke down in tears because he knew it was his son calling for help,\" Crump said. \n \n The new information is part of a trove of documents released by the Florida State Attorney today in the case against Zimmerman, who is charged with second degree murder for the Feb. 26 killing of Martin, an unarmed 17-year-old African American male. \n \n Surveillance video of Martin in a store purchasing skittles right before the fatal incident was also released today. \n \n Zimmerman, 28, is a multi-racial Hispanic man who volunteered for the neighborhood watch committee who claimed that he shot Martin in self-defense after the 6-foot tall, 160 pound teenager knocked him to the ground, banged his head against the ground and went for Zimmerman's gun. \n \n The documents start with a criticism of Zimmerman's decision to follow the teenager, who Zimmerman said was looking suspicious. \n \n \"The encounter between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin was ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman, if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement,\" an investigating officer wrote. \n \n Zimmerman claims he got out of his vehicle to find a house number to let police know where he saw the allegedly suspicious person, and while returning to his car was knocked down by a punch in the nose and attacked by Martin. \n \n Two police officers reported that when they arrived at the scene of the shooting, Zimmerman seemed to have a battered nose and bloodied face. One wrote that his \"facial area was bloodied,\" and the back of his clothing was soiled with wet grass. \n \n \"Zimmerman was also bleeding from the nose and the back of his head,\" Officer Ricardo Ayala wrote. \n \n Another officer wrote, \"I saw that Zimmerman's face was bloodied and it appeared to me that his nose was broken.\" \n \n Witnesses, whose names were redacted from the report, also lent support to Zimmerman's version of what happened. \n \n \"He witnesses a black male, wearing a dark colored 'hoodie' on top of a white or Hispanic male and throwing punches 'MMA (mixed martial arts) style,'\" the police report of the witness said. \"He then heard a pop. He stated that after hearing the pop, he observed the person he had previously observed on top of the other person (the male wearing the hoodie) laid out on the grass.\" \n \n A second witness described a person on the ground with another straddling him and throwing punches. The man on the bottom was yelling for help, the witness told police. \n \n The documents state that Zimmerman can be heard yelling for help 14 times on a 911 call recorded during the fight. \n \n Yet another witness described the confrontation in emotional terms. \n \n The witness heard \"someone yelling, almost crying. Then I heard a gunshot.\" The witness wrote that he or she \"saw a man on top of a guy laying on the ground. He was putting his hands on his neck or chest.\" \n \n The man asked the witness to call 911. \n \n \"He stood up and took a couple steps away and put his hands on his head and then walked back over to the guy on the ground. He looked at him for a minute, then started to walk away toward the road. That is when the police walked up,\" the witness wrote. \n \n The lead investigator on the case, Officer Christopher Serino, wrote that Zimmerman could be heard \"yelling for help as he was being battered by Trayvon Martin.\" \n \n Martin's death sparked public outrage after police released Zimmerman without any criminal charges for the killing. Zimmerman was later charged with second-degree murder, and the killing provoked widespread debate about racial profiling. \n \n The autopsy also shows that Zimmerman shot Martin from a distance of between 1 inch and 18 inches away, bolstering Zimmerman's claim that he shot Martin during a close struggle. \n \n Martin's autopsy report also revealed that there was a quarter-inch by half-inch abrasion on the left fourth finger of Martin, another indication of a possible struggle. \n \n The teen, who lived in Miami, was in Sanford while serving a suspension for an empty marijuana bag discovered in his possession. Martin had THC, the drug found in marijuana, in his blood on the night of his death, according to the autopsy. His family told ABC News that it was \"trace amounts\" of THC. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Story highlights Martin would be alive if Zimmerman stayed in his vehicle, police said \n \n Trayvon Martin was pronounced dead 3 minutes after firefighters and EMS arrived \n \n Evidence of THC, an ingredient in marijuana, was found in Martin's blood, tests show \n \n Firefighters find forehead \"abrasions\" and \"bleeding\" from Zimmerman's nose \n \n Just over two weeks after the fatal shooting, and less than a month before an arrest was made, police in Sanford, Florida, urged prosecutors to take George Zimmerman into custody after arguing his killing of Trayvon Martin was \"ultimately avoidable.\" \n \n This disclosure came out Thursday, part of a wealth of information released that is related to the case, including the medical's examiner's finding that the 17-year-old Martin had traces of drugs in his system in an autopsy conducted hours after his death. \n \n Overall, the newly released material paints the most complete picture yet of how investigators built the case, as well as its complexity. The police perspective was most succinctly stated in a March 13 \"capias request\" -- a request that someone be taken into custody -- sent to the state's attorney. It speaks to the fact that Zimmerman ignored a police dispatcher's advice not to chase Martin, as well as his communications with Martin prior to the shooting. \n \n \"The encounter between George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin was ultimately avoidable by Zimmerman, if Zimmerman had remained in his vehicle and awaited the arrival of law enforcement, or conversely if he had identified himself to Martin as a concerned citizen and initiated dialog (sic) in an effort to dispel each party's concern\" the request said. \"There is no indication that Trayvon Martin was involved in any criminal activity.\" \n \n In his 911 call just before the shooting, Zimmerman had speculated that the teen looked like he was \"up to no good or he's on drugs or something.\" \n \n But Martin's defenders have portrayed Zimmerman as the aggressor, accusing him of profiling the African-American teen. Plus, one expert notes the traces of the marijuana-related substance found in the teen's system, as measured hours after his death, don't necessarily speak to any level of intoxication, while another adds that marijuana use typically doesn't make people prone to aggression. \n \n JUST WATCHED Does new evidence change Trayvon case?

The autopsy was conducted February 27, the day after the teenager was shot dead. \n \n Toxicology tests found elements of the drug in the teenager's chest blood -- 1.5 nanograms per milliliter of one type (THC), as well as 7.3 nanograms of another type (THC-COOH) -- according to the medical examiner's report. There also was a presumed positive test of cannabinoids in Martin's urine, according to the medical examiner's report. It was not immediately clear how significant these amounts were. \n \n No precise levels on the urine were released. \n \n Dr. Michael Policastro, a toxicologist, cautioned against reading too much into the blood THC levels, adding that one cannot make a direct correlation between those findings and a level of intoxication. \n \n He also noted levels of THC, which can linger in a person's system for days, can spike after death in certain areas of the body because of redistribution. \n \n And Dr. Drew Pinsky, an addiction specialist who hosts a show on CNN's sister network HLN, added that marijuana typically does not make users more aggressive. \n \n Concentrations of THC routinely rise to 100 to 200 ng/ml after marijuana use, though it typically falls to below 5 ng/ml within three hours of it being smoked, according to information on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website. \n \n While some states have zero-tolerance policies for any drug traces for driving while impaired, others set certain benchmarks, the website of California's Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs notes. In Nevada, that equates to 2 ng/ml for THC and 5 ng/ml for THC-COOH, also known as marijuana metabolite. The cutoff level in Ohio is 2 ng/ml for THC and 50 ng/ml for THC-COOH. \n \n According to the medical examiner's report, which was one of several documents on the case released Thursday by the office of special prosecutor Angela Corey, Martin died from a gunshot wound to chest fired from \"intermediate range,\" within 36 inches. \n \n The autopsy report lists the manner of death as a homicide. \n \n JUST WATCHED Medical report lists Zimmerman injuries Replay More Videos ...

Krop High School in Miami. \n \n According to records obtained by the Miami Herald, Martin had been suspended from school three times: once for writing graffiti on a door, another time for school truancy and the last time due to drug residue being found in his backpack. \n \n Speaking of her son's suspension to CNN's Anderson Cooper, Sybrina Fulton said, \"Whatever he had dealings with the school, it was not criminal, it was not violent, he's never been arrested.\" \n \n Just before the shooting, Zimmerman called 911 to complain about a suspicious person in his neighborhood. \n \n In the call Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, said he was following Martin after the teen started to run, prompting the dispatcher to tell him, \"We don't need you to do that.\" \n \n Zimmerman apparently disregarded that advice. \n \n Much has been made about whether Zimmerman during that call used a racial epithet in referring to Martin. But an FBI analysis, released Thursday, determined that the word could not be definitively identified \"due to weak signal level and poor recording quality.\" \n \n A screaming voice could be heard on other 911 calls placed by neighbors, with some speculating those screams came from Martin and others that they belonged to Zimmerman. The FBI did not make a final determination either way, citing several reasons including the fact they came during \"an extreme emotional state,\" there weren't enough words to make a good comparison and the sound quality was low and distant. \n \n Zimmerman claimed, according a police report released earlier, that he'd been \"assaulted (by Martin) and his head was struck on the pavement.\" \n \n According a report from the Sanford Fire Department , released Thursday, Zimmerman had \"abrasions to his forehead,\" \"bleeding/tenderness to his nose,\" and a \"small laceration to the back of his head\" when emergency personnel arrived at the scene at 7:27 p.m., six minutes after they were first called. \n \n By that time, Martin had no apparent pulse, according to the fire and EMS report. Emergency personnel attempted mouth-to-mask resuscitation and chest compressions, to no avail. He was pronounced dead at 7:30 p.m. \n \n Prosecutors have said Zimmerman, who is a white Hispanic, killed the unarmed teenager unjustly after profiling him. Zimmerman, who has pleaded not guilty, has said that he shot Martin in self-defense. \n \n The start of the trial hasn't been set. \n \n The case put a spotlight on race relations, spurring protests nationwide and drawing prominent civil rights leaders to central Florida denouncing the actions of Sanford police and calling for Zimmerman's arrest. Special prosecutor Angela Corey announced he'd been charged on April 11, weeks after Sanford police initially declined to do so. \n \n It also raised questions about gun laws, as well as the merits of the \"Stand Your Ground\" law in Florida, and similar laws in other states that allow people to use deadly force anywhere they feel a reasonable threat of serious injury or death.",

    "document": "The most isolated tribe in the world? \n \n In the days after the cataclysmic tsunami of 2004, as the full scale of the destruction and horror wreaked upon the islands of the Indian Ocean became apparent, the fate of the tribal peoples of the Andaman Islands remained a mystery. \n \n It seemed inconceivable, above all, that the Sentinelese islanders could have survived, living as they did on a remote island directly in the tsunami\u2019s path. \n \n Yet when a helicopter flew low over the island, a Sentinelese man rushed out on to the beach, aiming his arrow at the pilot in a gesture that clearly said, \u2018We don\u2019t want you here\u2019. Alone of the tens of millions of people affected by the disaster, the Sentinelese needed no help from anyone. \n \n Perhaps no people on Earth remain more genuinely isolated than the Sentinelese. They are thought to be directly descended from the first human populations to emerge from Africa, and have probably lived in the Andaman Islands for up to 60,000 years. The fact that their language is so different even from other Andaman islanders suggests that they have had little contact with other people for thousands of years. \n \n This does not mean, however, that they live just as they did 60,000 years ago. Commonly described, for instance, as belonging to the \u2018Stone Age\u2019, they do in fact make tools and weapons from metal, which they recover from ships wrecked on the island\u2019s reefs. \n \n Like so many isolated tribal people with a fearsome reputation, the Sentinelese are often inaccurately described as \u2018savage\u2019 or \u2018backward\u2019. Their hostility to outsiders, though, is easily understandable, for the outside world has brought them little but violence and contempt. \n \n In 1879, for example, an elderly couple and some children were taken by force and brought to the islands\u2019 main town, Port Blair. The colonial officer in charge of the kidnapping wrote that the entire group, \u2018sickened rapidly, and the old man and his wife died, so the four children were sent back to their home with quantities of presents.\u2019 Despite being responsible for the deaths of at least two people, and quite possibly starting an epidemic amongst the islanders, the same officer expressed no remorse, but merely remarked on the Sentinelese\u2019s \u2018peculiarly idiotic expression of countenance, and manner of behaving.\u2019 \n \n How far this is from the truth can be easily judged from a video of the Sentinelese on the island\u2019s beach taken during an Indian government \u2018contact\u2019 expedition in the 1990s. \n \n The islanders are clearly extremely healthy, alert and thriving, in marked contrast to the two Andaman tribes who have \u2018benefited\u2019 from Western civilization, the Onge and the Great Andamanese, whose numbers have crashed and who are now largely dependent on state handouts just to survive. \n \n Pressure from Survival and other organisations has led the Indian government to alter its policy towards the Sentinelese, from attempting to make contact, to recognising that similar policies have proved disastrous for other Andaman tribes, and accepting that they have the right to decide for themselves how they wish to live. Underpinning this shift is the simple acknowledgment that the people themselves are best placed to decide what is in their own interests. ||||| The Sentinelese, thought to number between 50 and 200, have rebuffed all contact with the modern world, firing a shower of arrows at anyone who comes within range. \n \n They are believed to be the last pre-Neolithic tribe in the world to remain isolated and appear to have survived the 2004 Asian tsunami. \n \n The two men killed, Sunder Raj, 48, and Pandit Tiwari, 52, were fishing illegally for mud crabs off North Sentinel Island, a speck of land in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands archipelago. \n \n Fellow fishermen said they dropped anchor for the night on Jan 25 but fell into a deep sleep, probably helped by large amounts of alcohol. \n \n During the night their anchor, a rock tied to a rope, failed to hold their open-topped boat against the currents and they drifted towards the island. \n \n \"As day broke, fellow fishermen say they tried to shout at the men and warn them they were in danger,\" said Samir Acharya, the head of the Society for Andaman and Nicobar Ecology, an environmental organisation. \n \n \"However they did not respond - they were probably drunk - and the boat drifted into the shallows where they were attacked and killed.\" \n \n After the fishermen's families raised the alarm, the Indian coastguard tried to recover the bodies using a helicopter but was met by the customary hail of arrows. \n \n Photographs shot from the helicopter show the near-naked tribesmen rushing to fire. But the downdraught from its rotors exposed the two fisherman buried in shallow graves and not roasted and eaten, as local rumour suggested. \n \n Mr Acharya said the erroneous belief in the tribe's cannibalism grew from the practice of another tribe, the Onge, who would cut up and burn their dead to avoid them returning as evil spirits. \n \n \"People saw the flesh cooking on the fire and thought they must be cannibals but this incident clearly contradicts that belief,\" he said. \n \n Attempts to recover the bodies of the two men have been suspended, although the Andaman Islands police chief, Dharmendra Kumar, said an operation might be mounted later. \n \n \"Right now, there will be casualties on both sides,\" he said from Port Blair. \"The tribesmen are out in large numbers. We shall let things cool down and once these tribals move to the island's other end we will sneak in and bring back the bodies.\" \n \n Environmental groups urged the authorities to leave the bodies and respect the three-mile exclusion zone thrown around the island. \n \n In the 1980s and early 1990s many Sentinelese were killed in skirmishes with armed salvage operators who visited the island after a shipwreck. Since then the tribesmen have remained virtually undisturbed. \n \n DNA analysis of another tribe, the Jarawa, whose members made first contact with the outside world in 1997, suggest that the tribesmen migrated from Africa around 60,000 years ago. \n \n However, the experience of the Jarawa since their emergence - sexual exploitation, alcoholism and a measles epidemic - has encouraged efforts to protect the Sentinelese from a similar fate. ||||| 'I'm privileged to have this contact with the tribesmen,' said Mr Pandit, a director of the Anthropological Survey of India. 'Before, it was worse. They shot arrows when we tried to land.' \n \n The Sentinelese, as the islanders are known, live on North Sentinel, one of a chain of islands in the Bay of Bengal. Their skin is ash-black and their faces moon- shaped with negroid features. \n \n They can husk coconuts with their teeth, and use fire, which they hide and guard jealously because they do not know how to make it. With long bows and arrows tipped with iron salvaged from shipwrecks, they are superb marksmen. Farming is unknown to them. They survive on fish and turtles, and hunt wild pig and the huge monitor lizards that abound on their island, an area of a mere 30 square miles. \n \n Sentinelese songs contain just two notes, and they can only count up to two, above which they call everything else many. Their only form of art is body painting, which consists of wavy smears of white or ochre. \n \n More than 100 of the Sentinelese live in palm-built lean-tos around the island, yet they have no community structure, no chiefs and no witchdoctors. Their way of life is comparable to that of humans 15,000 years ago; it is possible that they have not evolved any further because they simply have not been required to do so. \n \n It took Indian anthropologists 24 years to befriend the islanders with gifts of coconut and iron chunks. But now that they have succeeded, Mr Pandit and his team are hesitant about how - or whether - these tribesmen should be 'civilised'. \n \n 'Permanent isolation isn't practical,' he said. 'They're surrounded by 200,000 people living in these islands. But the government has to make sure they're not harmed, and that they don't die from imported diseases.' \n \n The Sentinelese are not the only aboriginals left in Andaman, a chain of 361 islands stretching between India and Burma. Other aboriginals are hidden in the jungles, such as the Andamanese, the Onge and the Jarawa. But the Sentinelese have resisted contact the longest. \n \n When the British set up penal colonies in the Andaman Islands in the 1850s, the tribal population was estimated at about 5,000. The aboriginals resented the foreign intruders and fought back with their puny weapons. The British responded by slaughtering many of them, and today, fewer than 400 aboriginals are left. \n \n For many centuries, sailors viewed the Andaman Islands with dread: tales drifted back of shipwrecked survivors being eaten by cannibals. Mr Pandit claims, however, that the Andaman islanders never dined on their victims. They do, however, like to hang the jawbone of a favourite relative around their necks. \n \n Despite the many arrows shot at him, Mr Pandit insists the reputation of the Sentinelese for hostility is unfair. 'They're cautious, that's all. They want to defend themselves against outsiders.' \n \n The islanders cannot be oblivious to the forms of civilisation that surround them; freighters pass by on the horizon and planes across their skies. They make occasional forays in dugout canoes to hunt turtles or fish, but they don't seem to sail far out of sight of North Sentinel. \n \n Their aggressive isolation seems self-imposed. 'I'd give my right arm to know what they're thinking,' said Mr Pandit, 'but we just haven't learned enough about them yet.' \n \n When the first anthropological expedition reached the island in 1967, the Sentinelese hid in the jungle. When teams returned in 1970 and again in 1973, the scientists were greeted with a hail of arrows. Then in 1974, the anthropologists tried a different tack: they brought gifts of coconuts, pots and pans, and a live pig, and left them on the beach. \n \n But the Sentinelese were not so easily bought. Warriors with bows, arrows and spears lined the shore, posturing in defiance, and Mr Pandit recounted in a report: 'Sometimes they would turn their backs to us and sit on their haunches as if to defecate. This was meant to insult us and to say we were not welcome.' \n \n Unruffled, the anthropologists kept dropping gifts on the island, and the Sentinelese progressively grew less hostile and more playful. They love coconuts, which do not grow on North Sentinel. \n \n Finally, on 4 January 1991, Mr Pandit and his colleagues were met on the beach by a party of 28 men, women and children, for once unarmed. 'They may not have chiefs, but a decision had obviously been taken by the Sentinelese to be friendly towards us,' Mr Pandit said. 'We still don't know how or why.' \n \n Now, the anthropologists have learned to remove most of their clothes, watches and spectacles before visiting the Sentinelese and the Jarawa, another isolated tribe. 'I've lost half a dozen pairs of glasses,' lamented Mr Pandit, who has been stripped naked by the islanders on several occasions. 'Clothing doesn't make much sense to them,' he said. 'They're curious about what we're trying to hide underneath.' \n \n The anthropologists now practise the traditional Sentinelese greeting, which is to sit in a friend's lap and slap your right buttock vigorously. \n \n A debate is raging among scientists and Indian officials about how the Sentinelese should be treated. Some want them drawn into civilisation as rapidly as possible. But other Andaman tribes have been cruelly exploited: their women have been inveigled into brothels as exotica, the men coaxed away by opium and alcohol to trade in the edible birds' nests that the Chinese consider to be a delicacy. \n \n So far, the Indian government has banned all visitors to the island and forest areas where the aboriginals live. 'We can't leave them forever,' said Mr Pandit. \n \n 'But the government must ensure that, when they do come into contact with the outside world, the Sentinelese won't be uprooted or hurt. The question is: how?' \n \n (Photograph omitted)",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Sometimes paradise is better off lost: Off the coast of India in the Bay of Bengal, a Manhattan-size island called North Sentinel Island boasts a deep green canopy of trees, stretches of sandy beaches, coral reef barriers\u2014and a population that's decidedly hostile to outsiders, who aren't likely to live long. As Wackulus explains, the isolated indigenous tribe, one of the last of its kind on Earth, almost always attacks visitors. A little digging uncovered this story: After a night of drinking in 2006, two fishermen drifted too close to the island and were killed by the Sentinelese, who've lived there for 60,000 years. A helicopter sent to recover their bodies was halted by tribesmen's arrows, the Telegraph reported at the time; the air generated by the copter's rotors revealed their bodies in shallow graves. One of the earliest known encounters a century earlier ended when a convict who'd escaped from the neighboring Andaman Islands ended up on the island with his throat slit, the New York Times reported in 2012. In 1967, the Sentinelese\u2014a Stone Age people but for the metal-tipped arrows carved from wrecked ships\u2014hid from an Indian government expedition, during which a marker was placed on the island, declaring it part of India. Indian anthropologist TN Pandit's visits in the late 1980s and early 1990s proved more exciting. He left gifts of coconuts, knives, cloth, mirrors, and once a live pig. The native hunter-gatherers\u2014believed to number between 50 and 400\u2014killed the pig and buried it in the sand, but only insulted Pandit's group. \"They would turn their backs to us and sit on their haunches as if to defecate,\" he told the Independent. India has since established a 3-mile exclusion zone around the island to protect both outsiders and the natives from disease. Survival International argues it's all for the best as the natives are \"extremely healthy, alert, and thriving.\" They have fire and are believed to dine on fish, fruits, tubers, wild pigs, lizards, and honey. (This video reportedly shows the first contact with an isolated tribe.)",

    "document": "Some of the reports describe Pakistani intelligence working alongside Al Qaeda to plan attacks. Experts cautioned that although Pakistan\u2019s militant groups and Al Qaeda work together, directly linking the Pakistani spy agency, the Directorate for Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, with Al Qaeda is difficult. \n \n The records also contain firsthand accounts of American anger at Pakistan\u2019s unwillingness to confront insurgents who launched attacks near Pakistani border posts, moved openly by the truckload across the frontier, and retreated to Pakistani territory for safety. \n \n The behind-the-scenes frustrations of soldiers on the ground and glimpses of what appear to be Pakistani skullduggery contrast sharply with the frequently rosy public pronouncements of Pakistan as an ally by American officials, looking to sustain a drone campaign over parts of Pakistani territory to strike at Qaeda havens. Administration officials also want to keep nuclear-armed Pakistan on their side to safeguard NATO supplies flowing on routes that cross Pakistan to Afghanistan. \n \n This month, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in one of the frequent visits by American officials to Islamabad, announced $500 million in assistance and called the United States and Pakistan \u201cpartners joined in common cause.\u201d \n \n The reports suggest, however, that the Pakistani military has acted as both ally and enemy, as its spy agency runs what American officials have long suspected is a double game \u2014 appeasing certain American demands for cooperation while angling to exert influence in Afghanistan through many of the same insurgent networks that the Americans are fighting to eliminate. \n \n Behind the scenes, both Bush and Obama administration officials as well as top American commanders have confronted top Pakistani military officers with accusations of ISI complicity in attacks in Afghanistan, and even presented top Pakistani officials with lists of ISI and military operatives believed to be working with militants. \n \n Benjamin Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, said that Pakistan had been an important ally in the battle against militant groups, and that Pakistani soldiers and intelligence officials had worked alongside the United States to capture or kill Qaeda and Taliban leaders. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Still, he said that the \u201cstatus quo is not acceptable,\u201d and that the havens for militants in Pakistan \u201cpose an intolerable threat\u201d that Pakistan must do more to address. \n \n \u201cThe Pakistani government \u2014 and Pakistan\u2019s military and intelligence services \u2014 must continue their strategic shift against violent extremist groups within their borders,\u201d he said. American military support to Pakistan would continue, he said. \n \n Several Congressional officials said that despite repeated requests over the years for information about Pakistani support for militant groups, they usually receive vague and inconclusive briefings from the Pentagon and C.I.A. \n \n Nonetheless, senior lawmakers say they have no doubt that Pakistan is aiding insurgent groups. \u201cThe burden of proof is on the government of Pakistan and the ISI to show they don\u2019t have ongoing contacts,\u201d said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat on the Armed Services Committee who visited Pakistan this month and said he and Senator Carl Levin of Michigan, the committee chairman, confronted Pakistan\u2019s prime minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, yet again over the allegations. \n \n Such accusations are usually met with angry denials, particularly by the Pakistani military, which insists that the ISI severed its remaining ties to the groups years ago. An ISI spokesman in Islamabad said Sunday that the agency would have no comment until it saw the documents. Pakistan\u2019s ambassador to the United States, Husain Haqqani, said, \u201cThe documents circulated by WikiLeaks do not reflect the current on-ground realities.\u201d \n \n The man the United States has depended on for cooperation in fighting the militants and who holds most power in Pakistan, the head of the army, Gen. Parvez Ashfaq Kayani, ran the ISI from 2004 to 2007, a period from which many of the reports are drawn. American officials have frequently praised General Kayani for what they say are his efforts to purge the military of officers with ties to militants. \n \n American officials have described Pakistan\u2019s spy service as a rigidly hierarchical organization that has little tolerance for \u201crogue\u201d activity. But Pakistani military officials give the spy service\u2019s \u201cS Wing\u201d \u2014 which runs external operations against the Afghan government and India \u2014 broad autonomy, a buffer that allows top military officials deniability. \n \n American officials have rarely uncovered definitive evidence of direct ISI involvement in a major attack. But in July 2008, the C.I.A.\u2019s deputy director, Stephen R. Kappes, confronted Pakistani officials with evidence that the ISI helped plan the deadly suicide bombing of India\u2019s Embassy in Kabul. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n From the current trove, one report shows that Polish intelligence warned of a complex attack against the Indian Embassy a week before that bombing, though the attackers and their methods differed. The ISI was not named in the report warning of the attack. \n \n Another, dated August 2008, identifies a colonel in the ISI plotting with a Taliban official to assassinate President Hamid Karzai. The report says there was no information about how or when this would be carried out. The account could not be verified. \n \n General Linked to Militants \n \n Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul ran the ISI from 1987 to 1989, a time when Pakistani spies and the C.I.A. joined forces to run guns and money to Afghan militias who were battling Soviet troops in Afghanistan. After the fighting stopped, he maintained his contacts with the former mujahedeen, who would eventually transform themselves into the Taliban. \n \n And more than two decades later, it appears that General Gul is still at work. The documents indicate that he has worked tirelessly to reactivate his old networks, employing familiar allies like Jaluluddin Haqqani and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, whose networks of thousands of fighters are responsible for waves of violence in Afghanistan. \n \n General Gul is mentioned so many times in the reports, if they are to be believed, that it seems unlikely that Pakistan\u2019s current military and intelligence officials could not know of at least some of his wide-ranging activities. \n \n For example, one intelligence report describes him meeting with a group of militants in Wana, the capital of South Waziristan, in January 2009. There, he met with three senior Afghan insurgent commanders and three \u201colder\u201d Arab men, presumably representatives of Al Qaeda, who the report suggests were important \u201cbecause they had a large security contingent with them.\u201d \n \n The gathering was designed to hatch a plan to avenge the death of \u201cZamarai,\u201d the nom de guerre of Osama al-Kini, who had been killed days earlier by a C.I.A. drone attack. Mr. Kini had directed Qaeda operations in Pakistan and had spearheaded some of the group\u2019s most devastating attacks. \n \n The plot hatched in Wana that day, according to the report, involved driving a dark blue Mazda truck rigged with explosives from South Waziristan to Afghanistan\u2019s Paktika Province, a route well known to be used by the insurgents to move weapons, suicide bombers and fighters from Pakistan. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In a show of strength, the Taliban leaders approved a plan to send 50 Arab and 50 Waziri fighters to Ghazni Province in Afghanistan, the report said. \n \n General Gul urged the Taliban commanders to focus their operations inside Afghanistan in exchange for Pakistan turning \u201ca blind eye\u201d to their presence in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas. It was unclear whether the attack was ever executed. \n \n Photo \n \n The United States has pushed the United Nations to put General Gul on a list of international terrorists, and top American officials said they believed he was an important link between active-duty Pakistani officers and militant groups. \n \n General Gul, who says he is retired and lives on his pension, dismissed the allegations as \u201cabsolute nonsense,\u201d speaking by telephone from his home in Rawalpindi, where the Pakistani Army keeps its headquarters. \u201cI have had no hand in it.\u201d He added, \u201cAmerican intelligence is pulling cotton wool over your eyes.\u201d \n \n Senior Pakistani officials consistently deny that General Gul still works at the ISI\u2019s behest, though several years ago, after mounting American complaints, Pakistan\u2019s president at the time, Pervez Musharraf, was forced publicly to acknowledge the possibility that former ISI officials were assisting the Afghan insurgency. Despite his denials, General Gul keeps close ties to his former employers. When a reporter visited General Gul this spring for an interview at his home, the former spy master canceled the appointment. According to his son, he had to attend meetings at army headquarters. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It is impossible to know why the attacks never came off \u2014 either they were thwarted, the attackers shifted targets, or the reports were deliberately planted as Taliban disinformation. \n \n One report, from Dec. 18, 2006, describes a cyclical process to develop the suicide bombers. First, the suicide attacker is recruited and trained in Pakistan. Then, reconnaissance and operational planning gets under way, including scouting to find a place for \u201chosting\u201d the suicide bomber near the target before carrying out the attack. The network, it says, receives help from the Afghan police and the Ministry of Interior. \n \n In many cases, the reports are complete with names and ages of bombers, as well as license plate numbers, but the Americans gathering the intelligence struggle to accurately portray many other details, introducing sometimes comical renderings of places and Taliban commanders. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In one case, a report rated by the American military as credible states that a gray Toyota Corolla had been loaded with explosives between the Afghan border and Landik Hotel, in Pakistan, apparently a mangled reference to Landi Kotal, in Pakistan\u2019s tribal areas. The target of the plot, however, is a real hotel in downtown Kabul, the Ariana. \n \n \u201cIt is likely that ISI may be involved as supporter of this attack,\u201d reads a comment in the report. \n \n Several of the reports describe current and former ISI operatives, including General Gul, visiting madrasas near the city of Peshawar, a gateway to the tribal areas, to recruit new fodder for suicide bombings. \n \n One report, labeled a \u201creal threat warning\u201d because of its detail and the reliability of its source, described how commanders of Mr. Hekmatyar\u2019s insurgent group, Hezb-i-Islami, ordered the delivery of a suicide bomber from the Hashimiye madrasa, run by Afghans. \n \n The boy was to be used in an attack on American or NATO vehicles in Kabul during the Muslim Festival of Sacrifices that opened Dec. 31, 2006. According to the report, the boy was taken to the Afghan city of Jalalabad to buy a car for the bombing, and was later brought to Kabul. It was unclear whether the attack took place. \n \n The documents indicate that these types of activities continued throughout last year. From July to October 2009, nine threat reports detailed movements by suicide bombers from Pakistan into populated areas of Afghanistan, including Kandahar, Kunduz and Kabul. \n \n Some of the bombers were sent to disrupt Afghanistan\u2019s presidential elections, held last August. In other instances, American intelligence learned that the Haqqani network sent bombers at the ISI\u2019s behest to strike Indian officials, development workers and engineers in Afghanistan. Other plots were aimed at the Afghan government. \n \n Sometimes the intelligence documents twin seemingly credible detail with plots that seem fantastical or utterly implausible assertions. For instance, one report describes an ISI plan to use a remote-controlled bomb disguised as a golden Koran to assassinate Afghan government officials. Another report documents an alleged plot by the ISI and Taliban to ship poisoned alcoholic beverages to Afghanistan to kill American troops. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n But the reports also charge that the ISI directly helped organize Taliban offensives at key junctures of the war. On June 19, 2006, ISI operatives allegedly met with the Taliban leaders in Quetta, the city in southern Pakistan where American and other Western officials have long believed top Taliban leaders have been given refuge by the Pakistani authorities. At the meeting, according to the report, they pressed the Taliban to mount attacks on Maruf, a district of Kandahar that lies along the Pakistani border. \n \n The planned offensive would be carried out primarily by Arabs and Pakistanis, the report said, and a Taliban commander, \u201cAkhtar Mansoor,\u201d warned that the men should be prepared for heavy losses. \u201cThe foreigners agreed to this operation and have assembled 20 4x4 trucks to carry the fighters into areas in question,\u201d it said. \n \n While the specifics about the foreign fighters and the ISI are difficult to verify, the Taliban did indeed mount an offensive to seize control in Maruf in 2006. \n \n Afghan government officials and Taliban fighters have widely acknowledged that the offensive was led by the Taliban commander Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour, who was then the Taliban shadow governor of Kandahar. \n \n Mullah Mansour tried to claw out a base for himself inside Afghanistan, but just as the report quotes him predicting, the Taliban suffered heavy losses and eventually pulled back. \n \n Another report goes on to describe detailed plans for a large-scale assault, timed for September 2007, aimed at the American forward operating base in Managi, in Kunar Province. \n \n \u201cIt will be a five-pronged attack consisting of 83-millimeter artillery, rockets, foot soldiers, and multiple suicide bombers,\u201d it says. \n \n It is not clear that the attack ever came off, but its planning foreshadowed another, seminal attack that came months later, in July 2008. At that time, about 200 Taliban insurgents nearly overran an American base in Wanat, in Nuristan, killing nine American soldiers. For the Americans, it was one of the highest single-day tolls of the war. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Tensions With Pakistan \n \n The flood of reports of Pakistani complicity in the insurgency has at times led to barely disguised tensions between American and Pakistani officers on the ground. \n \n Meetings at border outposts set up to develop common strategies to seal the frontier and disrupt Taliban movements reveal deep distrust among the Americans of their Pakistani counterparts. \n \n On Feb. 7, 2007, American officers met with Pakistani troops on a dry riverbed to discuss the borderlands surrounding Afghanistan\u2019s Khost Province. \n \n According to notes from the meeting, the Pakistanis portrayed their soldiers as conducting around-the-clock patrols. Asked if he expected a violent spring, a man identified in the report as Lt. Col. Bilal, the Pakistani officer in charge, said no. His troops were in firm control. \n \n The Americans were incredulous. Their record noted that there had been a 300 percent increase in militant activity in Khost before the meeting. \n \n \u201cThis comment alone shows how disconnected this particular group of leadership is from what is going on in reality,\u201d the notes said. \n \n The Pakistanis told the Americans to contact them if they spotted insurgent activity along the border. \u201cI doubt this would do any good,\u201d the American author of the report wrote, \u201cbecause PAKMIL/ISI is likely involved with the border crossings.\u201d \u201cPAKMIL\u201d refers to the Pakistani military. \n \n A year earlier, the Americans became so frustrated at the increase in roadside bombs in Afghanistan that they hand-delivered folders with names, locations, aerial photographs and map coordinates to help the Pakistani military hunt down the militants the Americans believed were responsible. \n \n Nothing happened, wrote Col. Barry Shapiro, an American military liaison officer with experience in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, after an Oct. 13, 2006, meeting. \u201cDespite the number of reports and information detailing the concerns,\u201d Colonel Shapiro wrote, \u201cwe continue to see no change in the cross-border activity and continue to see little to no initiative along the PAK border\u201d by Pakistan troops. The Pakistani Army \u201cwill only react when asked to do so by U.S. forces,\u201d he concluded. ||||| A huge cache of secret US military files today provides a devastating portrait of the failing war in Afghanistan, revealing how coalition forces have killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents, Taliban attacks have soared and Nato commanders fear neighbouring Pakistan and Iran are fuelling the insurgency. \n \n The disclosures come from more than 90,000 records of incidents and intelligence reports about the conflict obtained by the whistleblowers' website WikiLeaks in one of the biggest leaks in US military history. The files, which were made available to the Guardian, the New York Times and the German weekly Der Spiegel, give a blow-by-blow account of the fighting over the last six years, which has so far cost the lives of more than 320 British and more than 1,000 US troops. \n \n Their publication comes amid mounting concern that Barack Obama's \"surge\" strategy is failing and as coalition troops hunt for two US naval personnel captured by the Taliban south of Kabul on Friday. \n \n The war logs also detail: \n \n \u2022 How a secret \"black\" unit of special forces hunts down Taliban leaders for \"kill or capture\" without trial. \n \n \u2022 How the US covered up evidence that the Taliban have acquired deadly surface-to-air missiles. \n \n \u2022 How the coalition is increasingly using deadly Reaper drones to hunt and kill Taliban targets by remote control from a base in Nevada. \n \n \u2022 How the Taliban have caused growing carnage with a massive escalation of their roadside bombing campaign, which has killed more than 2,000 civilians to date. \n \n In a statement, the White House said the chaotic picture painted by the logs was the result of \"under-resourcing\" under Obama's predecessor, saying: \"It is important to note that the time period reflected in the documents is January 2004 to December 2009.\" \n \n The White House also criticised the publication of the files by WikiLeaks: \"We strongly condemn the disclosure of classified information by individuals and organisations, which puts the lives of the US and partner service members at risk and threatens our national security. WikiLeaks made no effort to contact the US government about these documents, which may contain information that endanger the lives of Americans, our partners, and local populations who co-operate with us.\" \n \n The logs detail, in sometimes harrowing vignettes, the toll on civilians exacted by coalition forces: events termed \"blue on white\" in military jargon. The logs reveal 144 such incidents. \n \n Some of these casualties come from the controversial air strikes that have led to Afghan government protests, but a large number of previously unknown incidents also appear to be the result of troops shooting unarmed drivers or motorcyclists out of a determination to protect themselves from suicide bombers. \n \n At least 195 civilians are admitted to have been killed and 174 wounded in total, but this is likely to be an underestimate as many disputed incidents are omitted from the daily snapshots reported by troops on the ground and then collated, sometimes erratically, by military intelligence analysts. \n \n Bloody errors at civilians' expense, as recorded in the logs, include the day French troops strafed a bus full of children in 2008, wounding eight. A US patrol similarly machine-gunned a bus, wounding or killing 15 of its passengers, and in 2007 Polish troops mortared a village, killing a wedding party including a pregnant woman, in an apparent revenge attack. \n \n Questionable shootings of civilians by UK troops also figure. The US compilers detail an unusual cluster of four British shootings in Kabul in the space of barely a month, in October/November 2007, culminating in the death of the son of an Afghan general. Of one shooting, they wrote: \"Investigation controlled by the British. We are not able to get [sic] complete story.\" \n \n A second cluster of similar shootings, all involving Royal Marine commandos in Helmand province, took place in a six-month period at the end of 2008, according to the log entries. Asked by the Guardian about these allegations, the Ministry of Defence said: \"We have been unable to corroborate these claims in the short time available and it would be inappropriate to speculate on specific cases without further verification of the alleged actions.\" \n \n Rachel Reid, who investigates civilian casualty incidents in Afghanistan for Human Rights Watch, said: \"These files bring to light what's been a consistent trend by US and Nato forces: the concealment of civilian casualties. Despite numerous tactical directives ordering transparent investigations when civilians are killed, there have been incidents I've investigated in recent months where this is still not happening. \n \n Accountability is not just something you do when you are caught. It should be part of the way the US and Nato do business in Afghanistan every time they kill or harm civilians.\" The reports, many of which the Guardian is publishing in full online, present an unvarnished and often compelling account of the reality of modern war. \n \n Most of the material, though classified \"secret\" at the time, is no longer militarily sensitive. A small amount of information has been withheld from publication because it might endanger local informants or give away genuine military secrets. WikiLeaks, whose founder, Julian Assange, obtained the material in circumstances he will not discuss, said it would redact harmful material before posting the bulk of the data on its \"uncensorable\" servers. \n \n WikiLeaks published in April this year a previously suppressed classified video of US Apache helicopters killing two Reuters cameramen on the streets of Baghdad, which gained international attention. A 22-year-old intelligence analyst, Bradley Manning, was arrested in Iraq and charged with leaking the video, but not with leaking the latest material. The Pentagon's criminal investigations department continues to try to trace the leaks and recently unsuccessfully asked Assange, he says, to meet them outside the US to help them. Assange allowed the Guardian to examine the logs at our request. No fee was involved and WikiLeaks was not involved in the preparation of the Guardian's articles.",

    "document": "RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, one of the kingdom\u2019s top international businessmen, was released from detention on Saturday, more than two months after he was taken into custody in a sweeping crackdown on corruption. \n \n His release came hours after he told Reuters in an interview at Riyadh\u2019s opulent Ritz-Carlton hotel that he expected to be cleared of any wrongdoing and be freed within days. \n \n A senior Saudi official said Prince Alwaleed was freed after he reached a financial settlement with the attorney general. \n \n \u201cThe attorney general has approved this morning the settlement that was reached with Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, and the prince returned home at 1100 a.m. (0800 GMT),\u201d the official told Reuters, without giving details of the terms. \n \n The decision to free him, and the release of several other well-known tycoons on Friday, suggested the main part of the corruption probe was winding down after it sent shockwaves through Saudi Arabia\u2019s business and political establishment. \n \n In his first interview since being detained, conducted hours before his release, Prince Alwaleed told Reuters he maintained his innocence of any corruption in talks with the authorities. \n \n He said he expected to keep full control of his global investment firm Kingdom Holding Co 4280.SE without being required to hand assets to the state. He said he had been able to communicate with executives at his business while detained. \n \n Prince Alwaleed, who is in his early 60s, described his confinement as a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d and said he supported reform efforts by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. \n \n \u201cThere are no charges. There are just some discussions between me and the government,\u201d he said. \n \n Prince Alwaleed had been confined at the Ritz-Carlton since early November, along with dozens of other senior officials and businessmen, part of the crown prince\u2019s plan to reform oil superpower Saudi Arabia and consolidate his position. \n \n FOREIGN INVESTOR CONCERNS \n \n When asked if the attorney general was convinced of Prince Alwaleed\u2019s innocence, the senior Saudi official said: \n \n \u201cI will not negate or confirm what he says. Generally this falls back to those who concluded the settlement, and for sure there is no settlement unless there are violations, and they are not concluded without the accused admitting it in writing and promising not to repeat it.\u201d \n \n The source declined to give further details, but confirmed that Prince Alwaleed would remain head of Kingdom Holding. \n \n A Gulf banker who deals with Saudi Arabia said the authorities appeared keen to conclude the probe partly because foreign investors were concerned their assets or local business partners could be targeted in the wide-ranging crackdown. \n \n Prince Alwaleed\u2019s detention was particularly worrying for foreigners because of his international prominence as an investor in top Western companies such as Twitter (TWTR.N) and Citigroup (C.N), and in top hotels including the George V in Paris and the Plaza in New York, the banker said. \n \n \u201cThe government is signaling that it wants to move to a new phase now, away from the crackdown and into other economic reforms,\u201d the banker said. \n \n Outside Prince Alwaleed\u2019s Riyadh palace, dozens of cars lined the entrances as a huge Saudi flag flapped above. Guards cracked jokes and drank coffee. His office said the prince was out visiting family, but declined to give any details. \n \n Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal sits for an interview with Reuters in the office of the suite where he has been detained at the Ritz-Carlton in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia January 27, 2018, REUTERS/Katie Paul \n \n The attorney general said earlier this week that 90 detainees had been released after their were charges dropped, while others traded cash, real estate and other assets for their freedom. The authorities were still holding 95 people, he said. Some are expected to be put on trial. \n \n \u201cNOTHING TO HIDE\u201d \n \n An official Saudi source said on Friday that several prominent businessmen had reached financial settlements with the authorities, including Waleed al-Ibrahim, owner of regional television network MBC, who was released. Terms of his settlement were not revealed. \n \n Saudi authorities have said they expect to raise some $100 billion for the government through such settlements - a huge windfall for the state, which has seen its finances squeezed by low oil prices. Some private analysts think that target will be hard to hit, given how many suspects have seen charges dropped. \n \n Allegations against Prince Alwaleed included money laundering, bribery and extorting officials, a Saudi official told Reuters in November. The prince\u2019s net worth has been estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion. \n \n While declaring his innocence in the Reuters interview, the prince appeared greyer and thinner than in his last public appearance, a television interview in October, and had grown a beard while in detention. \n \n \u201cI have nothing to hide at all. I\u2019m so comfortable, I\u2019m so relaxed. I shave here, like at home. My barber comes here. I\u2019m like at home, frankly speaking,\u201d he said, adding he had been able to communicate with family members while in detention. \n \n He granted the 30-minute interview to Reuters, including a tour of his suite, partly to disprove rumors about mistreatment and that he had been moved from the hotel to a prison. \n \n Prince Alwaleed showed off the comforts of his gold-accented private office, dining room and kitchen, which was fully stocked with his preferred vegetarian meals. \n \n In the corner of his office sat tennis shoes, which he said he used regularly for exercise. A television played business news programs, and a mug with an image of his own face on it was perched on the desk. \n \n Slideshow (5 Images) \n \n After being released, Prince Alwaleed said, he would stay in Saudi Arabia and would return to the challenge of juggling his global business interests. \n \n \u201cI will not leave Saudi Arabia, for sure. This is my country.\u201d ||||| DUBAI\u2014Saudi authorities on Saturday released billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, more than two months after he was detained in a widespread purge of the kingdom\u2019s elite. \n \n Saudi officials said Saturday that Prince al-Waleed came to an undisclosed settlement with the government that allows him to remain chairman of his company, Kingdom Holding Co., one of the country\u2019s biggest conglomerates.

They were waiting on paperwork for Candelo so they could move back to the US, along with her two young daughters, when they were detained in an anti-gang raid in June 2016 and hit with weapons charges. Now, prisoners are rioting in the Helicoide, and Holt, 26, is using social media to plea for help. \"The prison where I am at has fallen the guards are here and people are trying to break in my room and kill me. WHAT DO WE DO?\" he posted on Facebook Wednesday. Holt's trial on the weapons charges was set to start Tuesday, but he and his wife were never brought to the courthouse, per the AP. \"They want to kill me and paint the walls with my blood,\" he added in another post, begging the US to help him and noting Venezuela's intelligence agency said it won't let him go \"as long as my government continues attacking this government.\" He also uploaded two short video clips making similar pleas, saying, \"I've been begging my government for two years. They say they're doing things but I'm still here.\" On Thursday, the US Embassy in Venezuela tweeted that it's concerned about the situation at the Helicoide and that Holt and other Americans there are in peril. \"The Venezuelan government is directly responsible for its security and we will hold it responsible if something happens to them,\" the embassy added.

He was 47 years old. \n \n Mr. Goldberg\u2019s brother posted the news on Facebook Saturday morning and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, a friend of the family, shared the post shortly after. \n \n The... ||||| David Goldberg, SurveyMonkey CEO and husband of Sheryl Sandberg \n \n The two met in 1996 when they both were working in Los Angeles, said Goldberg, who recently sat down with The Times before he spoke to an audience at \"Start-ups: Uncensored\" seminar at the Shutters on the Beach hotel in Santa Monica. \n \n He also happens to be married to Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook\u2019s chief operating officer, whom Forbes declared to be one of the most powerful women in the world. \n \n At 26 he sold his first start-up, Launch Media, for $12 million to Yahoo. Goldberg then served as general manager of Yahoo Music, and later left to work at Benchmark Capital as entrepreneur in residence. In 1999 he acquired a fledgling online survey company called SurveyMonkey and grew it into a billion-dollar business. \n \n \"We went out to dinner and a movie and hit it off. She fell asleep on my shoulder, which I thought was great,\" Goldberg said. \"Turns out, I learned much later, she sleeps through every movie, on any shoulder that is available, but it worked on me at that moment of time.\" \n \n Although Sandberg was dating someone else at the time and later moved to Washington, D.C., they remained good friends and started dating six years later. \n \n \u201cOn the day\u2013to-day stuff we both ask each other for advice. But it is great having one of the smartest people in business as your partner. I don\u2019t have to make an appointment to ask what you think about this or whatever, it\u2019s good with my team. I always say, 'Well Sheryl said.' \" \n \n In a competitive work environment in which many judge work ethic by the number of hours spent in the office, Goldberg encourages a work-life balance. He says he tries to remain rooted to his family and strives to lead by example. Despite the demands of their jobs, both Goldberg and Sandberg leave work at 5:30 p.m. \n \n \"We made the decision on this particular thing, that we are going to be home with our kids. I am at home with my kids from 6 to 8. If I have a work dinner, I\u2019ll schedule to have dinner after 8. But we\u2019re working at night. You\u2019ll get plenty of emails from me post-8 p.m. when my kids go to bed.\" \n \n While most CEOs stress success, Goldberg said he is big on failure. \n \n \"You want to hire great people and give them the opportunity to fail. You need to let them figure things out as they go along,\" he said. \"If they fail repeatedly, then you probably have to find a different person, but if you don\u2019t let people have that opportunity to fail, they don\u2019t get to learn and grow and try things.\" \n \n Although meetings are necessary and an important way to communicate and share information, Goldberg keeps them to a maximum of three regularly scheduled meetings a week. \n \n \"I just find that people can waste a lot of time in meetings, so I try to restrict meetings to the minimum that they need to be,\" he said. \"But I have lots of time in my day where I am available to have informal conversations, where I grab someone to talk, and people can just walk up to my desk and talk to me.\" \n \n He added: \"We have a lot to do. But it is not whether or not we get it done tomorrow or the next day that is going to matter. So we get it done over a long period of time. For me going home at 5:30 is as much about my own choices, but also giving my team those choices too.\"",

In his own life, he made sure he could be at home with the kids while his wife, whom he had encouraged to fight for a high salary, was traveling. Both often left work at 5:30 to have dinner with their two kids, the Los Angeles Times reported in 2013\u2014though he noted that doesn't mean they don't work after dinner. Goldberg was \"the first major chief executive in memory to spur his wife to become as successful in business as he was,\" adds the New York Times, and was a central figure in Sandberg's bestseller, Lean In. \"The most important career choice you\u2019ll make is who you marry.

    "document": "By JPOST.COM STAFF, REUTERS \n \n Photo: REUTERS/Darren Whiteside \n \n Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said on Friday he would demand full membership of the United Nations when he goes to the UN General Assembly next week, setting up a diplomatic clash with Israel and the United States. \n \n \n \n \"We are going to the United Nations to request our legitimate right, obtaining full membership for Palestine in this organization,\" Abbas said in a televised speech, indicating he would seek a vote on the issue in the UN Security Council. \n \n RELATED: \n \n \"We are going to the Security Council,\" he added, to rapturous applause from his audience of Palestinian leaders. \"As for other options, we have not yet taken a decision on them,\" he said.Abbas said that nobody should have any illusions that he will come back from New York with independence.\"If we succeed, and this is what we are working towards, then we must know that the day following the recognition of the state, the occupation will not end,\" Abbas said.\"But we will have obtained the world's recognition that our state is occupied and that our land is occupied and not disputed territory, as the Israeli government claims,\" he said.He added that the move is not intended to isolate Israel or delegitimize its legal status. \"Israel is there, no one can isolate or take away its legal status, but we need to isolate the policies of Israel. We need to put an end to the occupation and take away the legal status of the occupation.\"The PA president said that recognition of statehood with pre-1967 borders is necessary for renewed negotiations with Israel. \"We need to have full [UN] membership within [pre-1967] borders in order to go to negotiations on a basis adopted by the world so that we may discuss the permanent issues of Jerusalem, borders, refugees - and our prisoners in Israeli prisons.\"\"We're not going there to bring independence, we will come back to negotiate the issues, but god willing, we need full membership in the UN.\"He stressed that any popular protests in support of his initiative should be peaceful. Jerusalem fears that the UN showdown could spark violence across the West Bank and is putting IDF forces on high alert in the area.Abbas is due to address the UN General Assembly on Sept. 23, when he said he would present Palestine's membership bid. ||||| \u201cWe need to have full membership at the U.N.,\u201d Mr. Abbas said in the speech from his office in the West Bank city of Ramallah, which was broadcast live on Al Jazeera and other outlets. \u201cWe need a state, a seat at the United Nations.\u201d \n \n He added, \u201cWe are going to the Security Council,\u201d as Palestinian dignitaries gave him rousing applause and a standing ovation. Mr. Abbas called it \u201cour decision, which we have conveyed to everyone.\u201d \n \n The borders Mr. Abbas seeks are those of 1967, meaning East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza would be included. More than 500,000 Israelis have settled beyond those lines. \n \n Israel, while officially accepting the idea of a Palestinian state, wants to leave nearly all of the settlers where they are and keep control of Jerusalem. It also fears militant groups and missiles would penetrate such a state unless Israel controls its borders, an approach rejected by the Palestinians. \n \n Photo \n \n One goal of the move is to gain admission to a range of international legal and diplomatic forums where complaints against Israeli occupation and settlement could be pursued. Mr. Abbas said he was not seeking to delegitimize Israel, only to advance negotiations between two equals. \n \n For the Obama administration, the move poses an acute dilemma. It has vowed to use its veto because it argues that the only viable way toward Palestinian statehood is through direct talks with Israel. But for the past eight months, Arab countries have risen in revolt against dictators and the Palestinian question has totemic significance for the entire region. \n \n The United States has struggled to place itself on the side of those seeking justice and freedom in the current revolts. But the Obama administration has supported uprisings in Libya and, less strongly, in Syria , while looking the other way during a crackdown by an ally, Bahrain . A veto of Palestinian membership would intensify Arab perceptions of American double standards. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Moreover, Republican lawmakers have vowed to end American aid to the Palestinian Authority if it seeks United Nations membership, something the administration opposes. That could create further chaos on the ground. \n \n The White House sent two senior diplomats, Dennis B. Ross and David M. Hale, on repeated trips to Jerusalem and Ramallah in recent weeks to try to work out an alternative to a United Nations campaign. \n \n In recent days, senior administration officials said, the United States was trying to get agreement on a statement, backed by the international community, affirming President Obama \u2019s proposal last May to negotiate the creation of a Palestinian state. That plan would use as a baseline the pre-1967 boundaries of Israel, with land swaps. But Palestinian officials said it was too little too late. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

There is no reason whatsoever for the United States not to support us on this step.\u201d \n \n The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel issued a curt statement, saying, \u201cPeace will not be achieved by a unilateral approach to the United Nations.\u201d \n \n Mr. Netanyahu says that the Palestinians must not be rewarded for avoiding direct talks and tough sacrifices. Some of his ministers have called for a range of punitive responses, including annexing portions of the West Bank or removing travel privileges from Palestinian officials. He has not expressed himself publicly on those suggestions. \n \n Video \n \n At the Arab League , which had strongly urged the Palestinians to take the less confrontational path of seeking limited statehood recognition via the General Assembly, an official said the group would now nonetheless stand firmly behind Mr. Abbas. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity in order not to upstage leaders of the league, who were traveling to New York for the United Nations annual meetings. \n \n Officials of Hamas , the militant Palestinian faction that controls Gaza, said Mr. Abbas\u2019s declaration was a useless stunt aimed at continuing what it called fruitless negotiations with Israel, which Hamas does not recognize as a legitimate state. \n \n \u201cThe speech is an attempt to justify the negotiations,\u201d said Mahmoud Zahar, a Hamas leader, reached by telephone. He argued that turning to the United Nations would get Mr. Abbas nothing. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Hamas has banned public demonstrations in Gaza to support Mr. Abbas\u2019s move. Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman, told reporters that Mr. Abbas had approached the United Nations unilaterally, without winning support from the group, despite what Mr. Barhoum called the Palestinian president\u2019s rhetoric about reconciliation. \n \n Mr. Abbas\u2019s speech was played live on the official channel Palestine TV with the \u201cUN 194\u201d logo of the statehood recognition bid in the bottom left-hand corner of the screen. Some Palestinians listened; others said it mattered little because the United States would veto it. \n \n Admission to the United Nations as a full member state requires a recommendation from the 15-member Security Council, with a majority of nine votes, and no veto from the five permanent members, which include the United States. Then the submission goes to the General Assembly, which must pass it by a two-thirds vote among the 193 members. \n \n The American vow to veto has already made it clear that the membership application will not make it out of the Council. But as in other matters involving the United Nations bureaucracy, procedural and legal tools can delay the application for weeks or months along the way. And the Palestinians could still subsequently seek less formal recognition of statehood through the General Assembly. \n \n Mr. Abbas is aware of the obstacles ahead, some diplomats said, and may not object to the uncertainty. He ended his speech, saying, \u201cAs for other options, we have not yet taken a decision on them.\u201d \n \n The theory is that by going to the Council, Mr. Abbas makes his strongest political and symbolic act. And for Mr. Abbas, a man who is 76 and speaks frequently about retiring, that may be part of the point. In addition, the procedural delays at the Council could provide the time for an alternative negotiation framework to mature. \n \n But that is a distinctly minority view of how events are likely to proceed. Most analysts and officials fear the combination of Israeli and Palestinian intransigence, along with a roiling region, will create the conditions for confrontation rather than negotiation.",

But a cheerful outlook on life may be good for your heart. So concludes new research on the impact of happiness and optimism on cardiovascular health. \n \n Scientists have known about the reverse relationship between psychological health and heart health for some time; studies show that depression and anxiety can worsen outcomes for heart patients. But the findings on happiness and its medical impact over the years have not been as consistent. \n \n Really? Anahad O\u2019Connor tackles health myths. \n \n In a new analysis, researchers at Harvard sought a more definitive conclusion by reviewing the results of more than 200 studies looking at cardiovascular risks and emotional state, making this the largest report on the subject to date. Over all, the researchers found that traits like optimism and hope, and higher levels of happiness and satisfaction with one\u2019s life, were linked with reductions in the risk of heart disease and stroke. \n \n Such associations can be hard to untangle. Does being optimistic directly protect health, or is it the reverse \u2014 that people who watch their weight, exercise often and are generally in good health simply have more reason to be happy and optimistic? While researchers cannot say for sure, some studies have found a protective effect for optimism even after controlling for things like socioeconomic status, body weight and smoking. \n \n One study last year, for example, looked at 8,000 people and found a lower risk of heart disease among those who reported more happiness or satisfaction in areas like career, sex life and family, but not in areas like romance and standard of living. The relationship remained after accounting for the subjects\u2019 demographic data as well as their health behaviors. \n \n THE BOTTOM LINE \n \n Optimism and happiness are associated with lower cardiovascular risk, but whether a positive outlook directly protects health is still under investigation. \n \n ANAHAD O\u2019CONNOR \n \n scitimes@nytimes.com ||||| Optimists are twice as likely to be in ideal cardiovascular health \n \n CHAMPAIGN, Ill. -- People who have upbeat outlooks on life have significantly better cardiovascular health, suggests a new study that examined associations between optimism and heart health in more than 5,100 adults. \n \n \"Individuals with the highest levels of optimism have twice the odds of being in ideal cardiovascular health compared to their more pessimistic counterparts,\" said lead author Rosalba Hernandez, a professor of social work at the University of Illinois. \"This association remains significant, even after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and poor mental health.\" \n \n Participants' cardiovascular health was assessed using seven metrics: blood pressure, body mass index, fasting plasma glucose and serum cholesterol levels, dietary intake, physical activity and tobacco use - the same metrics used by the American Heart Association to define heart health and being targeted by the AHA in its Life's Simple 7 public awareness campaign. \n \n In accordance with AHA's heart-health criteria, the researchers allocated 0, 1 or 2 points - representing poor, intermediate and ideal scores, respectively - to participants on each of the seven health metrics, which were then summed to arrive at a total cardiovascular health score. Participants' total health scores ranged from 0 to 14, with a higher total score indicative of better health. \n \n The participants, who ranged in age from 45-84, also completed surveys that assessed their mental health, levels of optimism, and physical health, based upon self-reported extant medical diagnoses of arthritis, liver and kidney disease. \n \n Individuals' total health scores increased in tandem with their levels of optimism. People who were the most optimistic were 50 and 76 percent more likely to have total health scores in the intermediate or ideal ranges, respectively. \n \n The association between optimism and cardiovascular health was even stronger when socio-demographic characteristics such as age, race and ethnicity, income and education status were factored in. People who were the most optimistic were twice as likely to have ideal cardiovascular health, and 55 percent more likely to have a total health score in the intermediate range, the researchers found. \n \n Optimists had significantly better blood sugar and total cholesterol levels than their counterparts. They also were more physically active, had healthier body mass indexes and were less likely to smoke, according to a paper on the research that appears in the January/February 2015 issue of Health Behavior and Policy Review. \n \n The findings may be of clinical significance, given that a 2013 study indicated that a one-point increase in an individual's total-health score on the LS7 was associated with an 8 percent reduction in their risk of stroke, Hernandez said. \n \n \"At the population level, even this moderate difference in cardiovascular health translates into a significant reduction in death rates,\" Hernandez said. \"This evidence, which is hypothesized to occur through a biobehavioral mechanism, suggests that prevention strategies that target modification of psychological well-being - e.g., optimism - may be a potential avenue for AHA to reach its goal of improving Americans' cardiovascular health by 20 percent before 2020.\" \n \n Believed to be the first study to examine the association of optimism and cardiovascular health in a large, ethnically and racially diverse population, the sample for the current study was 38 percent white, 28 percent African-American, 22 percent Hispanic/Latino and 12 percent Chinese. \n \n Data for the study were derived from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, an ongoing examination of subclinical cardiovascular disease that includes 6,000 people from six U.S. regions, including Baltimore, Chicago, Forsyth County in North Carolina, and Los Angeles County. \n \n Begun in July 2000, MESA followed participants for 11 years, collecting data every 18 months to two years. Hernandez, who is an affiliated investigator on MESA, is leading a team in conducting prospective analyses on the associations found between optimism and heart health. \n \n \"We now have available data to examine optimism at baseline and cardiovascular health a decade later,\" said Hernandez, who expects to have an abstract completed in 2015. \n \n ### \n \n Co-authors of the current study were Kiarri N. Kershaw of Northwestern University; Juned Siddique, Honghan Ning and Donald M. Lloyd-Jones, all of Northwestern University; Julia K. Boehm of Chapman University; Laura D. Kubzansky of Harvard University; and Ana Diez-Roux of Drexel University. \n \n The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the National Center for Research Resources funded the research.",

    "document": "Occupy Wall Street showdown looms between protesters and NYPD cops over cleaning of Zuccotti Park \n \n Timothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty A member of the NYPD looks over demonstrators with 'Occupy Wall Street' protest at Zuccotti Park before they start cleaning up their belongings Thursday. \n \n A showdown loomed Friday morning between Occupy Wall Street and the NYPD after protesters vowed to defy orders to leave Zuccotti Park so it can be cleaned. \n \n The city said protesters could return to the park after the cleanup - but without the sleeping bags, tents and tarps that have made their 28-day sit-in possible. \n \n \"We see this as a pretext to shut the occupation down,\" protester Amin Husain said. \n \n Occupy Wall Street said it would resist any attempt by the city or the owners of the park to shift protesters from the public plaza where they have camped since Sept. 17. \n \n \"They will not foreclose our home!\" Husain shouted. \"This is an occupation, not a permitted picnic. We won't allow them to come in.\" \n \n They geared up for a confrontation, calling on supporters to mobilize at 6 a.m. \"to defend the occupation from eviction.\" \n \n They planned to link arms and fortify the park perimeter with a human chain, forcing mass arrests if the cleanup goes forward. \n \n Brookfield Properties, which owns the park but must legally allow 24-hour public access, said conditions \"have deteriorated to unsanitary and unsafe levels\" and said it must power wash the plaza today. \n \n The NYPD said if Brookfield complains that people are interfering with the company's efforts to clean the park, cops will start making arrests. \n \n City Hall assured the protesters they could return to the park after the cleanup and stay as long as they liked - as long as they didn't break the law. \n \n But Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said the NYPD would start enforcing Brookfield's rules against camping gear. \n \n \"The equipment, sleeping bags - that sort of thing will not be able to be brought back into the park,\" Kelly said. \n \n A group of city pols rallied last night, calling on Mayor Bloomberg to reconsider what they called his \"eviction notice\" and warning him that the world was watching Zuccotti Park. \n \n \"This is how revolutions start,\" said Brooklyn Councilman Charles Barron. \"Mr. Mayor? You want to clean up something? Clean up these crooks on Wall Street!\" \n \n On Twitter, hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons offered to \"pay for the cleanup of Zuccotti Park to avoid confrontation.\" \n \n Mass arrests are liable to simply fuel Occupy Wall Street: the rag-tag movement's biggest boosts in the past month have come from the sympathy and publicity generated by what protesters described as heavy-handed police tactics. \n \n To counter claims that the park is unsanitary, Occupy Wall Street used brooms and bleach to clean it up themselves beginning yesterday. \n \n The crowd voted to spend $3,000 from their $150,000 donation fund on power washers, gardening supplies and professional sanitation workers. \n \n The rented power washers proved to be no use since the park has no water supply. \n \n With Rocco Parascandola, John Doyle and Erin Einhorn \n \n hkennedy@nydailynews.com ||||| On Thursday evening, a couple dozen Occupy Wall Street protesters in Zuccotti Park grabbed brooms and buckets and set about sweeping up the site. For the last two days, they had begun to work harder than usual to keep the park clean and attractive, putting their brooms to work, filling up buckets of water at nearby restaurants and even, according to one protester, planting flowers. \n \n Protesters say they are cleaning the park so that the city doesn't have to do so. On Wednesday, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that Zuccotti Park would be closed temporarily at the end of the week so that sanitation workers could clean it, which they had not done since the protests began. Many of the protesters said they saw this as a ploy to get them out of the park permanently, and their suspicions were further intensified when Ray Kelly, the commissioner of the NYPD, said Thursday that they would not be able to bring back their sleeping bags and other items after leaving. The city's clean-up is scheduled for 7:00 a.m. Friday, and many of the protesters have vowed to resist any attempt at evacuation. \n \n In a letter sent to Kelly on Tuesday, Richard B. Clark, the chief executive of Brookfield Properties, the company that owns the park, wrote, \"After weeks of occupation, conditions at the park have deteriorated to unsanitary and unsafe levels.\" \n \n On behalf of the protestors, a group of New York civil liberties lawyers issued a letter to Clark today in which they wrote that a sanitation group at the site has been addressing the concerns raised in Clark's letter \"all along\" and has \"committed itself to carrying out a thorough and complete cleaning\" as an extra measure. \n \n \"Trash has consistently been bagged and hauled to established collection points and recycling rules have been strictly adhered to,\" they wrote, adding that the sanitation group \"typically has had between one and fifteen people sweeping the Park with brooms at any time.\" \n \n The lawyers concluded their letter with an offer to meet to resolve the controversy. \n \n Brendan Burke, a protester who lives in Brooklyn, said that he runs \"patrols\" several times each day, pressing people to keep their spaces clean. Not everyone complies, he said, but overall, the group has been more orderly and respectful than not. Because this is New York, he found it fitting to add that he had yet to see a rat. \n \n At 6:00 p.m. Thursday, while protesters began the cleaning effort, a group of about 20 New York council members and state senators expressed their support of the protesters at a press conference in the plaza across the street from the park. They included Margaret Chin, the city council member whose district includes Wall Street. \"I call on the mayor to do everything you can to make sure the peaceful demonstrations continue,\" she said. \n \n Jumaane Williams, a council member from Brooklyn, addressed the mayor directly. \"Hopefully you'll be remembered for something other than dismantling democracy in this city.\" He finished his speech with a flourish, leading the crowd in a chorus of a chant that has reverberated through the area for weeks: \"All day, all week, Occupy Wall Street.\" \n \n About an hour after the press conference ended, there was a tense stand-off between police and protesters on Wall Street outside of the restaurant Cipriani. A scrum of protesters had marched down to the restaurant because they'd heard that the mayor would be making an appearance at a gala there. They gathered across the street from the restaurant, shouting slogans, while a line of police stood in front of them, blocking the restaurant's entrance. They left after the police threatened to arrest them. \n \n Angela Doyle, the executive vice president of 1199SEIU, a local health care workers' union, said that she had been inside the restaurant when the mayor presented an award. When the room rose to give him a standing ovation, she said, two tables of union representatives \"sat on their hands.\" \n \n When she heard that there were protesters outside, she said, she decided to come take a look. The union's goals are \"completely congruous\" with those of the protesters, she said. \n \n Standing outside the restaurant, smoking a cigarette, she said she was thinking about reaching out to her friends in the sanitation union to see if she could interest any of them in volunteering to help the protesters with the clean-up. Like the protesters, she was suspicious of the mayor's intentions. \"If sanitation is his concern, \" she said, \"I could show him some neighborhoods in the Bronx.\"",

    "document": "MADRID (AP) \u2014 A body found on a rural property in northwest Spain is most likely that of an American woman who went missing while walking along a pilgrimage route, officials said Saturday. \n \n Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said evidence pointed to the remains being those of Denise Thiem and there were \"well-founded suspicions\" that the 39-year-old prime suspect arrested over her disappearance was responsible for her death. \n \n A ministry spokesman had earlier said Miguel Angel Munoz had led investigators to his small farm near the Camino de Santiago, also called the St. James Way, after being arrested Friday in Asturias, 200 kilometers (124 miles) to the north. \n \n The remains found at the property \"effectively appear to those of Denise,\" Fernandez Diaz told reporters. \n \n The minister said Munoz had been arrested when a police operation found him in the town of Grandas de Salime in the province of Asturias where he had fled. \n \n Thiem, 41, of Arizona, was last seen April 5 walking along the route at the town of Astorga, 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of Santa Catalina de Somoza, which is also on the St. James Way and is the town closest to Munoz's farm, the ministry said. \n \n The suspect was described by the ministry as a man who \"was little-known in his own neighborhood and did not relate much to society.\" \n \n Fernandez Diaz said the FBI had cooperated in the search, which at one point involved 300 police and military personnel as well as helicopters. \n \n The Camino de Santiago has for centuries led pilgrims and tourists to the city of Santiago de Compostela at Spain's northwestern tip, where the cathedral is believed to house the bones of St. James, one of the 12 apostles of Jesus. ||||| A suspect in the disappearance of an American woman missing since April from a famed Christian pilgrimage route in northern Spain was arrested Friday and led authorities to the body of a woman, a Spanish security official said. \n \n The arrest, and the discovery of the body, came after about 300 Spanish officers searched the area where Denise Thiem, 41, of Arizona was last seen April 5 in the town of Astorga. \n \n Authorities were trying to determine whether the body was that of Thiem, said the security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of rules preventing the official from being named. \n \n The official provided no details about the suspect or where the body was found. \n \n Astorga is on the El Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route, also called the St James Way, which ends at the Roman Catholic cathedral in the city of Santiago de Compostela. \n \n Spanish TV showed footage Friday of officers at a small apartment building taking away the suspect, a bearded man who appeared to be in his 30s. He was not identified. \n \n The U.S. Embassy in Madrid declined comment about the arrest of the suspect, citing privacy laws that prevent the disclosure of information about the case. \n \n Thiem's disappearance prompted safety concerns about the 470-mile (760-kilometer) series of pilgrimage routes, which tens of thousands of people walk annually.
