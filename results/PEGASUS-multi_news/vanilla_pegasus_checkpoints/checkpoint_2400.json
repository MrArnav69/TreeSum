    "document": "As we reported earlier, LulzSec says that it has bowed out of the limelight for good after fifty days of headline-grabbing hacking of corporate and governmental targets. Along with its final statement, it released a data dump including a wide range of information. We\u2019ve downloaded it, so what\u2019s inside? \n \n We\u2019re not going into details here, simply providing an overview of what LulzSec has released. \n \n AOL: While you may have been secretly hoping for some juicy memos akin to The AOL Way, what we actually have is a text file that begins: \u201cThe purpose of this document is to provide the AOL Network Engineering Staff, Management and any other pertinent persons a detailed review, analysis and recommended \u2018best practices\u2019 document for the implementation of layer 4 through 7 switching configurations.\u201d \u2013 it\u2019s an incredibly technical document. \n \n AT&T: A large .rar archive includes a huge number of internal documents related to AT&T\u2019s LTE rollout. It includes meeting memos, emails, media reports, PDFs, Powerpoint presentations and more. \n \n Battlefield Heroes: This text file appears to be a list of account details for over 550,000 users of social game Battlefield Heroes. \n \n FBI Being Silly: This text file includes the output of a URL on the FBI website. We\u2019ll admit to not knowing the technical significance of why this is \u2018silly\u2019 as yet. \n \n Hackforums.net: This appears to be 200,000 user details for Hackforums.net in a .csv file. \n \n Nato-bookshop.org: Similarly, this appears to be 220,000 user logins for a NATO online bookshop (the URL currently redirects to the main NATO site). \n \n Evidence that LulzSec hacked the US Navy website: An image is included showing the phrase \u201cPablo Escobar AntiSec\u201d inserted multiple times on a list of Navy salary grades. \n \n Office networks of corporations: A text file seemingly listing IP numbers of internal Corporate networks, including Disney, EMI and Universal. \n \n Email login details supposedly for a number of private investigators: Self-explanatory. \n \n User login details for \u201cRandom gaming forums\u201d: It\u2019s unclear which forums. \n \n \u201cSilly routers\u201d: A list of IP numbers for routers with passwords set to either \u2018root\u2019 or \u2018admin\u2019. \n \n So there we go \u2013 that\u2019s our first parse through. No doubt any significant information within the dump will be explored in more depth as it is uncovered. ||||| Or stated differently: Have the ill-winds of fate caught the Lulz Boat's sails? \n \n Today, quite unexpectedly, LulzSec Security announced its retirement. \"This is our final release, as today marks something meaningful to us. For the past 50 days we've been disrupting and exposing corporations, governments, often the general population itself, and quite possibly everything in between, just because we could\", according to a statement from the hacker group. \"Our planned 50 day cruise has expired, and we must now sail into the distance, leaving behind -- we hope -- inspiration, fear, denial, happiness, approval, disapproval, mockery, embarrassment, thoughtfulness, jealousy, hate, even love\". \n \n My question: \"Planned?\" Based on other LulzSec communication, the group sounded like it was in this snatch-and-post thing for the long haul -- the Lulz Boat was on a long voyage of piracy and firing its canons at many targets to come. For example, on June 23, with release of documents taken from Arizona Dept. of Public Safety servers, LulzSec writes: \"Every week we plan on releasing more classified documents and embarrassing personal details of military and law enforcement in an effort not just to reveal their racist and corrupt nature but to purposefully sabotage their efforts to terrorize communities\". \n \n From that statement, I expected an ongoing release of information. Less than a week ago, LulzSec teamed up with hacker group Anonymous for mission AntiSec (Anti-Security), which seeks to expose any government-classified information that can be stolen. From LulzSec's Twitter feed: \"Our next step is to categorize and format leaked items we acquire and release them in #AntiSec 'payloads' on our website and The Pirate Bay\". \n \n LulzSec called on other hackers to join the cause, later bragging about its allies: \"The Lulz Boat is sailing alongside allied ships, gathering and sorting booty for the masses. How are the winds for everyone?\" By all appearances, LulzSec had embarked on a long campaign of looting servers and posting the booty. \n \n So was 50 days really the plan all along or have the winds changed? The hacker group surely has made enemies, after hacking the FBI, CIA and US Senate and, more recently, Arizona public safety. The latter data dump revealed names, addresses, cell phone numbers and other personal information of cops. If law enforcement wasn't mobilized before, surely it is now. Ill winds would bring brigadiers on pursuing warships. Has perhaps the Lulz Boat's captain peered through his telescope and spied enemies on the horizon and chosen to take safe harbor? \n \n Maybe I missed some earlier LulzSec communication about a grand 50-day plan. Please correct me if I did. Perhaps today's announcement is just a big gag -- the Lulz Boat sending a decoy to sea, while it sails for new booty and the enemy fleet moves in the wrong direction. \n \n If it's over then today's data dump is the last, unexpectedly, since LulzSec had promised many more, and I can't help wonder if the pirates aren't on the run. LulzSec's full statement: \n \n Friends around the globe, We are Lulz Security, and this is our final release, as today marks something meaningful to us. 50 days ago, we set sail with our humble ship on an uneasy and brutal ocean: the Internet. The hate machine, the love machine, the machine powered by many machines. We are all part of it, helping it grow, and helping it grow on us. For the past 50 days we've been disrupting and exposing corporations, governments, often the general population itself, and quite possibly everything in between, just because we could. All to selflessly entertain others - vanity, fame, recognition, all of these things are shadowed by our desire for that which we all love. The raw, uninterrupted, chaotic thrill of entertainment and anarchy. It's what we all crave, even the seemingly lifeless politicians and emotionless, middle-aged self-titled failures. You are not failures. You have not blown away. You can get what you want and you are worth having it, believe in yourself. While we are responsible for everything that The Lulz Boat is, we are not tied to this identity permanently. Behind this jolly visage of rainbows and top hats, we are people. People with a preference for music, a preference for food; we have varying taste in clothes and television, we are just like you. Even Hitler and Osama Bin Laden had these unique variations and style, and isn't that interesting to know? The mediocre painter turned supervillain liked cats more than we did. Again, behind the mask, behind the insanity and mayhem, we truly believe in the AntiSec movement. We believe in it so strongly that we brought it back, much to the dismay of those looking for more anarchic lulz. We hope, wish, even beg, that the movement manifests itself into a revolution that can continue on without us. The support we've gathered for it in such a short space of time is truly overwhelming, and not to mention humbling. Please don't stop. Together, united, we can stomp down our common oppressors and imbue ourselves with the power and freedom we deserve. So with those last thoughts, it's time to say bon voyage. Our planned 50 day cruise has expired, and we must now sail into the distance, leaving behind - we hope - inspiration, fear, denial, happiness, approval, disapproval, mockery, embarrassment, thoughtfulness, jealousy, hate, even love. If anything, we hope we had a microscopic impact on someone, somewhere. Anywhere. Thank you for sailing with us. The breeze is fresh and the sun is setting, so now we head for the horizon. Let it flow... Lulz Security - our crew of six wishes you a happy 2011, and a shout-out to all of our battlefleet members and supporters across the globe ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Our mayhem: http://lulzsecurity.com/releases/ Our chaos: http://thepiratebay.org/user/LulzSec/ Our final release: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/6495523/50_Days_of_Lulz Please make mirrors of material on the website, because we're not renewing the hosting.

It's a broad indictment of campus culture, but contains neither profanity nor calls for direct action. \n \n \"Welcome to Lebanon High School, where smiles are fake and suicide prevention is something to laugh at,\" she said in the video, criticizing her peers' reaction to the Stop It app the Wilson County school had put out in response to the death. \n \n Her ire was not restricted to students, however.

Gipson disputed that, saying she had two coaches' permission. \n \n Walters also said the video hurt his feelings, and those of teachers, too. \n \n He said he's received feedback from parents and students who didn't agree with the video, including a gift from a student who told him he was doing a good job.

I think she's done a great job in bringing to light a very sensitive and needed subject.\" \n \n Gipson said her punishment is worth the good she feels the video has produced. \n \n Then she posted another spoken-word poem on Youtube, titled \"Have I Made a Difference Yet?\" urging teenagers like her to speak up. \n \n \"I never knew that it would get this big, and through it getting this big I've learned a lesson: This is not my school, this is everyone's school, this is a national problem,\" she said. ||||| (CNN) A high school student who posted an anti-bullying video attacking her school's administration was given a two-day suspension, but the school is saying it had nothing to do with her video's message. \n \n Emily Gipson is a student at Lebanon High School in Lebanon, Tennessee.

    "document": "Jake Bouvy (l.) and Kelsey Halverson squared off to win a summer job in Emmis Digital's \"Intern Games.\" In the end, both were declared victors. View Full Caption DNAinfo/ Mark Konkol \n \n RIVER NORTH \u2014 Getting a job after college once entailed padding your resume, writing a witty-yet-professional cover letter and nailing the job interview. \n \n My pal M.L. Elrick once tried to win over a Newsday editor by offering a \"free set of steak knives\" \u2014 a catchy line from a popular infomercial back in the day \u2014 in exchange for a job interview.* \n \n These days, however, young adults vying for a shrinking number of white-collar jobs can't rely on a good resume, the power of a well-crafted letter and a charismatic personality alone. \n \n In this age of digital commerce, young folks preparing to enter the workforce must display ninja-type skills in producing viral videos, attracting social media scrums and communicating to customers, clients and anyone who will listen on Instagram, among other things. \n \n There's probably no better example of this than Emmis Digital's recent search for interns that pitted applicants against each other in a \"Hunger Games\"-themed social media contest for the honor of working for no pay. \n \n More than 25 college kids applied for the one internship available at the River North office. The top 10 candidates were invited in for interviews, and the field was whittled down to three finalists. \n \n Emmis Digital's Rory Foster and Katlyn Hayes created a contest, the \"Intern Games,\" to determine the finest free summer laborer in the land. \n \n \"At a digital company, innovation is key. We're looking for candidates with a wide variety of skills, and we wound up with three really qualified people on paper,\" Foster said. \"We thought that it would be fun to pit them against each other, test their mettle and see who was the hungriest.\" \n \n Plus, Foster said, the contest turned an otherwise boring intern selection process into an event with potential to at least incrementally increase the social media reach of the company's collection of websites. \n \n Each of the three \"tributes\" \u2014 potential interns, that is \u2014 was assigned to drive social media by pushing their friends, family and fans to follow Emmis Digital pages and create a video explaining why they've proved themselves worthy. \n \n Every day for two weeks they battled for social media supremacy under the hashtag banners \u2014 #TeamJake, #TeamKelsey and #TeamKatie. \n \n Jake Bouvy, a marketing major at Indiana University, was ready to rumble. \n \n \"Once I knew it was a competition I knew I had to give everything,\" he said. \"I'm a competitive guy. I don't like to lose.\" \n \n At first, Kelsey Halverson, a journalism major at Iowa State, wasn't really sure what to make of the Intern Games. \n \n \"I hadn't competed in anything since sports in high school, so it was unexpected,\" Halverson said. \"I've never had to do anything like this before.\" \n \n Emmis Digital's \"Intern Games\" master Katlyn Hayes (r.) declared Kelsey Halverson and Jake Bouvy winners of the social media contest to earn a summer job. View Full Caption DNAinfo/ Mark Konkol \n \n For two weeks, the three finalists battled by constantly pestering everyone in their social media networks \u2014 and sending out quirky posts, photos and short videos aimed at driving traffic to Emmis websites \u2014 in hopes of avoiding elimination. \n \n After a week, #TeamKatie had been felled. \n \n In the end, Halverson and Bouvy went head to head. \n \n Bouvy appeared to gain an edge with a slick video to a hip-hop beat that showed off his technical skill and social media success promoting indie music videos online. \n \n But Halverson's #TeamKelsey still had the edge in driving traffic and attracting Facebook \"likes\" for Emmis. \n \n \"When I saw that she was beating me, and I had been on Twitter and Facebook begging my friends and family to please like this page, I started to think I was doing too much work to end up losing,\" Bouvy said. \n \n All the while, Hayes was back at the office keeping tabs on the successes and setbacks of their potential intern tributes in preparation for a final decision. \n \n \"I think it was definitely more fun for me than it was for them,\" she said. \"I got to watch them battle it out every day.\" \n \n When time ran out on the Intern Games, #TeamKelsey was the clear winner. \n \n \"Kelsey was the true winner. She had the higher impact on social media,\" Foster said. \"But in the end we decided, much like the 'Hunger Games,' to keep both finalists.\" \n \n Hayes said the decision was easy \u2014 and not because having two unpaid interns instead of one cost exactly the same. (The interns receive college credit for their summer labor.) \n \n \"I loved how creative Jake was, and loved how professional Kelsey was,\" she said. \"I knew a mix of them would make a super intern, so I wanted both of them to be here.\" \n \n On a recent workday, Bouvy reflected on how fortunate he was to be spared elimination and what he learned during the Intern Games. \n \n \"I was worried, but it all worked out. But it speaks to the state of the job market. You have to stand out in the pack,\" he said. \"It's a message to kids coming out of college that you can't just send out a resume, and hope for the best like your parents did.\" \n \n * Elrick didn't get that interview at Newsday, but went on to a stellar investigative reporting career that resulted in a Pulitzer Prize, getting Detroit's corrupt former mayor thrown in jail, among other things. \n \n For more neighborhood news, listen to DNAinfo Radio here: ||||| Katlyn Hayes held no fewer than six internships at various agencies during her college career. Today, the ad ops specialist at Emmis Digital explains her thinking succinctly: \u201cCompetition breeds excellence.\u201d Like a growing number of companies these days \u2014 especially in the digital space \u2014 Emmis recently hired a few new interns using some unorthodox social media-heavy methods. \n \n The potential interns at Emmis had to compete in a \u201cHunger Games\u201d social media style competition. In the end, a field of 25 was pared down to 10, then to three. Every day for two weeks, the candidates liberally deployed the hashtags #TeamJake, #TeamKelsey, and #TeamKatie in tweets, videos and Facebook posts in order to impress the folks at Emmis. \n \n The two finalists, Kelsey Halverson and Jake Bouvy, were eventually both offered unpaid internships due to their creative skills in different areas, combining to create what Hayes called \u201ca super intern.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n It was a bit surprising to hear about unpaid, often cutthroat, internships in an exciting and positive light, especially in light of the fact that Cond\u00e9 Nast recently settled a lawsuit brought by underpaid interns and ditched their unpaid internship program. \n \n \u201cExperience is so important in today\u2019s world. Resumes won\u2019t even get glanced at if students don\u2019t leave school with decent real-world experience,\u201d Hayes lamented. \u201cYou learn in a very different way than you would in a classroom. Therefore, unpaid internships are, in fact, very important. Everyone has to start somewhere.\u201d \n \n Employers are even looking beyond the internship when it comes to filling jobs through social media channels. Increasingly, they will engage with potential employees on various online platforms before they even ask them to fill out an application. The days of filling out a piece of paper while you sweat under your tie are disappearing. \n \n National Public Radio, for example, has created hiring managers out of all their employees, giving prospective hires a better idea of what they are going into. For instance, having employees use a hashtag to talk openly about their jobs. \n \n \u201cI came up with the idea of #NPRlife at NPR as a simple hashtag employees could use when tweeting, Instragramming, etc. about work-related things that fans or prospects might be interested,\u201d says Lars Schmidt, the Founder of Amplify Talent. \u201cThe intent was to create a platform where employees could share their experience, helping prospects get a sense of the culture and people they\u2019d work with if they joined NPR.\u201d \n \n What this interaction led to was over 2,500 Instagrams and 10,000 tweets from the current NPR staff, a $100,000 a year savings in job board postings and the Twitter handle @NPRjobs becoming one of their top sources of hiring. Not to mention a dedicated Twitter chat (#NPRTwitterChat) that evolved to assist job seekers with their use of social media. \n \n Schmidt has recently taken this to SpaceX, a current client. \n \n \u201cI wanted to find a way to capture the excitement of a rocket launch,\u201d Schmidt tells me. \u201cSo we decided to record audio of the launch countdown and employee reaction and load it to SoundCloud. We\u2019ll be embedding this in some of our recruiting materials to help prospects get a sense of the excitement surrounding a launch, and they\u2019ll be a part of that cheer.\u201d \n \n In the social media age of recruiting, all senses are engaged. The choice between using blue or black ink on an application has been replaced by the picking either six- or 15-second video platforms. Employers, especially in the digital space, know that the best talent isn\u2019t just words on a piece of paper. The best talent is 140 characters or less. ||||| Internships have always been competitive, but at one company, they've gotten downright cutthroat. \n \n Media company Emmis Digital's Chicago branch decided to do something a little different with its intern recruitment process this year, according to DNAinfo. It received over 25 applications from college students for its one unpaid internship spot. The 10 best applicants were interviewed, and then the final three entered the \"Intern Games,\" a contest to land the internship that would earn them some college credit. \n \n \"We thought that it would be fun to pit them against each other, test their mettle, and see who was the hungriest,\" Emmis Digital's Rory Foster told DNAinfo. \n \n Every day for two weeks in late April and early May, #TeamJake, #TeamKelsey, and #TeamKatie took to social media with tweets, videos, and Facebook posts to get the most attention for themselves and Emmis. \n \n In the end, the Emmis team decided to call it a draw between two of the potential interns and recruited both Jake Bouvy and Kelsey Halverson. \n \n Internships for college students and recent college graduates have been under more scrutiny in the past couple years, after several interns sued their former employers for back pay. Unpaid internships by law are required to provide education and experience that benefits the interns. (The Emmis interns do receive college credit.) \n \n The research firm Intern Bridge told the Boston Globe that surveys show about a 20% decrease in the number of unpaid internships across the country since the U.S. Department of Labor defined what constituted an unpaid internship in 2010. \n \n Unpaid internships may be scarcer in 2014, but if Emmis is any indicator, the market is still tough enough that college students are willing to intensely compete for them.",

The media company narrowed down its pool of applicants to three college students, then made them compete in a Hunger Games-inspired \"Intern Games.\" OK, they weren't trying to kill each other, but the \"tributes\" faced off against one another to see who could bring the most traffic to the company's social media. They also had to make videos to prove they deserved the unpaid job. \"We thought that it would be fun to pit them against each other, test their mettle, and see who was the hungriest,\" says one of the employees who came up with the idea. In the process, he notes, Emmis stood to boost its social media following; would-be interns were told to badger their friends, family, and followers to follow the company. Two of the three finalists were ultimately given internships. One of the creators of the Intern Games herself had at least six internships during college, Digiday reports.

Jake Bouvy and Kelsey Halverson went head-to-head, and Halverson ultimately won. \"When I saw that she was beating me, and I had been on Twitter and Facebook begging my friends and family to please like this page, I started to think I was doing too much work to end up losing,\" Bouvy says. \"I got to watch them battle it out every day.\"",

Less than two hours later, they were back _ in different clothes _ for the Christmas service. \n \n The Queen arrived first _ dressed in a lavender-colored coat and hat _ in a royal limousine, leading the way into the church. Her oldest son, Prince Charles, and his wife, Camilla, trailed behind. \n \n Prince Harry walked in with his brother William and new sister-in-law Kate_ now known as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. Kate, whose style is closely watched around the world and who sends any dress she wears flying off the shelves in Britain, wore an eggplant-colored coat and matching hat. \n \n Among the other royals present was the queen's granddaughter, Zara Philips, who was joined by her new husband Mike Tindall, an English rugby player. \n \n After the service, children lined up to give bouquets of flowers to the queen. Thanking each well-wisher, the queen then handed the bouquets to her granddaughters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. \n \n Well-wisher Camilla Fitt, 71, said Charles told her that his father, Philip, was \"very determined\" to get well. \n \n \"Charles said he is coming on,\" said Fitt. \n \n The royal family then traveled back to the house for lunch, an integral part of their celebration. \n \n Another key part of their Christmas festivities is the queen's annual message to the nation, which this year will focus on family and community. \n \n The 85-year-old queen has made a prerecorded Christmas broadcast on radio since 1952 and on television since 1957.

The twins were previously known as Alison and Ann Dadow. \n \n Kindlon described the crash as an accident. Duval \"left Hawaii to come back to grieve, not to escape from justice,\" he said. The sisters were originally from the Utica area, according to the Star Advertiser of Honolulu. \n \n Duval was taken into custody by Maui police after being discharged from the hospital days after the accident. A judge later ordered her release after determining there was no probable cause for a murder charge, the AP reported.

If we said we're going to have a prize for exceptional leadership, we have to stick to that. We are not going to compromise.\" \n \n \"We are not just in the business of positive messages - we would lose our credibility,\" the AFP news agency quotes him as saying. \n \n \"The prize committee reviewed a number of candidates but none met all of the criteria needed to win the prize,\" said committee member Salim Ahmed Salim. \n \n The two other winners in the six years since the prize was launched were Botswana's President Festus Mogae and Mozambique's Joaquim Chissano. \n \n Earlier this month, Mr Ibrahim's foundation announced a special $1m award to Archbishop Desmond Tutu for \"speaking truth to power\". \n \n The London-based body called the cleric \"one of Africa's great voices for justice, freedom, democracy and responsible, responsive government\". \n \n Sudan-born telecoms entrepreneur Mr Ibrahim says the good governance prize is needed because many leaders of sub-Saharan African countries come from poor backgrounds and are tempted to hang on to power for fear that poverty awaits them when they leave office. ||||| The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited the two economists for \"the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design.\" \n \n The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences was the last of the 2012 Nobel awards to be announced. \n \n It's not technically a Nobel Prize, because unlike the five other awards it wasn't established in the will of Alfred Nobel, a Swedish industrialist also known for inventing dynamite. \n \n The economics prize was created by the Swedish central bank in Nobel's memory in 1968, and has been handed out with the other prizes ever since. Each award is worth 8 million Swedish kronor, or about $1.2 million. ||||| Two American economists won the Nobel Prize in economics Monday for their research into how to match different actors in given markets, such as job seekers with employers and patients with donated kidneys. David Wessel has details on Lunch Break. Photo: AP. \n \n Two Americans won the Nobel Prize in economics Monday for research that has improved the way people are matched with limited resources, such as patients with donated organs or students with their preferred high schools. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Reuters Lloyd Shapley, above, and Alvin Roth won the prize in economics for separate bodies of work that have helped kidney patients and high-school applicants. \n \n Alvin Roth, a Harvard University professor who is moving to Stanford University, and Lloyd Shapley of the University of California Los Angeles were honored \"for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design,\" the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said. \n \n Their research focuses on how to fairly and efficiently match people with things\u2014be they employers, schools or donated kidneys\u2014when pricing isn't involved. Their work led to systems used by school districts in New York City, Boston and other cities to place students in high schools; by hospitals to match donated kidneys with patients; and by a program that assigns recent medical-school graduates to hospitals for residency programs. \n \n Messrs. Shapley and Roth worked independently, rather than together. \n \n The academy pointed to Mr. Shapley's research, starting in the 1950s, that was highly theoretical\u2014he initially examined how spouses select one other\u2014and later was used by Mr. Roth to address real-life situations. \n \n Real Time Economics Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley were lauded for their research on how to match different agents in markets, such as job seekers with employers.

Mr. Sonmez, who also has done research on matching kidney donors and patients, said the systems developed by Messrs. Shapley and Roth have made it easier for families to find others for kidney exchanges. \"We can use some of these insights to optimally organize these exchanges so that we can save as many lives as possible,\" he said. \n \n Two American economists have won the Nobel Prize in economics for their work in researching market design and putting practical applications in use. Harvard's Alvin Roth and Lloyd Shapley of UCLA were honored. Video: Associated Press. \n \n The academy said the pair's combined work \"has generated a flourishing field of research and improved the performance of many markets.\" The award, officially called the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, carries a $1.2 million prize. \n \n Mr. Shapley, 89 years old and a professor emeritus at UCLA, was honored for 1960s-era research, conducted with the late David Gale, that theorized how men and women could be matched for marriage. A \"stable\" match occurred when each side's preferences were met. The academy said Mr. Shapley's algorithm ensured \"stable matching\" and served to \"limit agents' motives for manipulating the matching process.\" \n \n Winners & Their Work Read more about the 2012 laureates.

View Graphics \n \n Mr. Roth, 60, later used that theoretical research to address real-world problems. Starting in the 1980s, he first examined the residency system used to assign medical-school graduates to hospitals and determined that the system led to \"stable matches.\" But not for all. The system couldn't accommodate doctor couples who wanted to be placed in the same region. Mr. Roth redesigned the system to take into account such requests when placing residents. \n \n Mr. Roth helped redesign New York City's process for assigning students to high schools in 2004. Under the old system, students would list their top five preferred schools. Schools, in turn, were more likely to admit students who ranked them as their first choice. After three rounds of selections, remaining students were assigned through an administrative process, the Academy said. Some 30,000 students a year were assigned to schools for which they had expressed no preference, the academy said in a description of Mr. Roth's work. Mr. Roth designed a new system, based on Mr. Shapley's and Mr. Gale's initial algorithm, that addressed those issues. In the first year, the number of students assigned to schools they hadn't requested dropped by 90%. \n \n Getty Images Alvin Roth \n \n In a phone interview broadcast during a news conference in Sweden, Mr. Roth joked, \"When I go to class this morning, my students will pay more attention.\" \n \n He said in a separate interview that one outcome of his research is that schools are responsive to families' preferences. \"School places are scarce resources. What's a good place for one child may differ from child to child,\" Mr. Roth said. The algorithms developed by Mr. Roth and his colleagues let schools use the information provided by parents on which schools would best suit their children. \"It would be a shame not to use that information well,\" he said. \n \n In a statement released by UCLA, Mr. Shapley's sons, Peter and Christopher Shapley, said, \"We know he is tremendously thankful that his life's work is being recognized with such a prestigious award and grateful for the many congratulations expressed by colleagues and friends.\" \n \n Write to Josh Mitchell at joshua.mitchell@dowjones.com",

    "document": "Acknowledging that survivors of sexual violence often behave differently than victims of other crimes, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin released an expansive report Monday that the UT System will use to train hundreds of officers who handle campus sexual assaults. \n \n The Blueprint for Campus Police, drafted by UT Austin\u2019s Institute on Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault, will be incorporated into training for almost 600 officers across all eight of the system\u2019s academic institutions. \n \n \u201cPolice in America, historically, have responded to the investigation of crimes in kind of a generalized fashion, regardless of whether it\u2019s a homicide, robbery, theft,\u201d or assault, according to Mike Heidingsfield, the UT System director of police. Because assault victims have experienced trauma, their cases often call for a more specialized officer response he said. \n \n The training is especially necessary because of the prevalence of sexual assault, according to No\u00ebl Busch-Armendariz, the report\u2019s principal investigator. One study, released in September, found that more than 18 percent of female undergraduates at UT Austin had been sexually assaulted since arriving on campus. \n \n The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. \n \n The report offers specific guidelines for officers from the moment they first interact with victims. \u201cLet the victim know that they are safe,\u201d the report reads. \u201cLet the victim know they will not be judged,\u201d and \u201cunderstand that a victim\u2019s alcohol or drug use is an issue of increased \u2018vulnerability rather than culpability.\u2019\u201d \n \n The specificity of the report allows officers to approach abstract concepts, like empathy, in immediate, real-world ways, according to Busch-Armendariz. \u201cWe wanted to make the blueprint a product that was meaningful and useful,\u201d she said. \n \n Some signs that might indicate an individual is lying about being the victim of a crime \u2014 if their story changes between retellings, or if they can\u2019t remember key details, for example \u2014 must be reinterpreted in the context of assault, she added. \n \n \u201cTrauma victims often omit, exaggerate, or make up information when trying to make sense of what happened to them or to fill gaps in memory,\u201d the report reads. \u201cThis does not mean the sexual assault did not occur.\u201d \n \n The eight academic institutions in the UT System have unique cultures \u2014 and unique prevailing beliefs about assault \u2014 but some misunderstandings about rape are widespread nationally, Heidingsfield said. Two years ago, the U.S. Department of Education launched a federal investigation into UT Pan American (which has since been merged into UT Rio Grande Valley) and 54 other colleges over their handling of sexual abuse complaints. \n \n The report acts as sort of a primer about the reality and impact of sexual assault, addressing a number of \u201ccommon rape myths\u201d as well as concepts such as victim blaming. \n \n The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one. \n \n \u201cIf a girl is raped while drunk, she is at least somewhat responsible for letting things get out of control,\u201d reads the first entry on the myth list. Other items include \u201cif a guy is drunk, he might rape someone unintentionally\u201d and \u201ca lot of times, girls who say they were raped agreed to have sex and then regret it.\u201d \n \n After adapting their perceptions based on the reality of assault, police officers are encouraged to adopt policies that are \u201cvictim-centered, science-based, and trauma-informed,\u201d Heidingsfield said. \n \n Another dominant theme of the report is victim behavior after an incident of assault. Although officers might expect survivors to be hysterical or crying, they are often \u201cin shock and passive, quiet, and unemotional,\u201d the report reads. \n \n \u201cThe crown jewel to this research effort for us is that we now have the science to understand neurobiology, and victimology, to apply that to how victims present themselves to police officers,\u201d Heidingsfield said. This \u201callows us to push tradition to the side and now understand why victims say what they do.\u201d \n \n Although the report outlines best practices for dealing with survivors of sexual assault, researchers did not actually interview survivors in the process of conducting their study. Instead, they relied on 27 interviews with campus presidents and police officers, among others. \n \n The report\u2019s authors did employ previously collected data from survivors in other institute studies, Busch-Armendariz said. \n \n \u201cThe retelling of incidents wasn\u2019t really necessary for the data they\u2019re collecting, and they had the information they needed,\u201d said Jenny LaCoste-Caputo, a UT System spokeswoman. The researchers did not want to \u201creopen real emotional wounds,\u201d she added. \n \n Disclosure: The University of Texas at Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.

The alleged victim herself never filed an official complaint with campus or city police officers, according to the lawsuit. \n \n But the University of Texas at Austin has recommended that the 21-year-old male student, who is one semester away from earning a degree in physics, be expelled for violating the institutional rules of the college, the suit states. \n \n The attorney for the male student has asked a judge to stop UT-Austin from holding a planned disciplinary hearing at which Title IX investigators for the school have recommended his expulsion. \n \n Court documents state the male student has not been afforded his Constitutional due process rights and that the allegations in question do not constitute sexual assault, among other protestations lodged by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. \n \n Drunken sex? \n \n On the night of the alleged assault on March 6, 2015, the plaintiff, John Doe, met two girls, Jennifer Smith and non UT-Austin student Jane Roe (names changed to protect privacy) at a house party near campus. \n \n After several hours of excessive drinking and flirting, the plaintiff went to Roe\u2019s apartment along with Smith. Roe was drunk and largely incoherent, and Smith allegedly told Doe at that point that if he had sex with Roe it would be rape, court documents state, adding Doe asked to crash on the couch and Smith and Roe went to sleep in the bedroom. \n \n However, not long after, Smith came out from the bedroom and asked Doe to have sex with her, a version of events both agree upon, court documents state. They had sex on the bed as Roe was asleep next to them. \n \n The following morning was just as eventful. \n \n According to the lawsuit, \u201cMs. Roe, who had fallen to the floor during the night, woke up and got back into bed\u201d \u2013 the bed where Smith and Doe were asleep. Roe and Doe then began to touch each other in suggestive manners. Smith left the bed during the foreplay to give the two privacy, the lawsuit states. \n \n \u201cWhile collecting her things, Ms. Smith heard Ms. Roe talking, saw her responding to the plaintiff\u2019s touching, and believed that Ms. Roe intended to have consensual sex with the plaintiff as she was about to leave,\u201d the suit states. \n \n \u201cAt no time during sex was Ms. Roe unconscious,\u201d it added. \u201cShe was an active sexual participant at all times during the intercourse that took place that morning.\u201d \n \n Later that day, however, Roe texted Smith that she was unconscious during the sex and was upset her friend had left her alone in her apartment with Doe: \u201cI don\u2019t remember throwing up, or coming home, or having this random fucking guy in my bed. \u2026 I didn\u2019t want this guy. At all. This guy wanted me and got me when I wasn\u2019t conscious.\u201d \n \n In reply to Roe\u2019s text, Smith said: \u201cDude I didn\u2019t realize you were unconscious, you were talking to me\u2026\u201d \n \n In the weeks after the incident, Doe and Roe texted each other. At first, Roe indicated she was upset with Doe and said she thought the sex was nonconsensual because she was unconscious. However, through chatting on Facebook and texting, Roe became satisfied \u201cthat both the plaintiff and Ms. Smith believed Ms. Roe was awake and sober during the sex that took place, despite her own lack of memory,\u201d the suit states. \n \n \u201cMs. Roe would acknowledge that she believed the sex between her and the plaintiff \u2018sounded passionate\u2019 and she was surprised that she had confided in him that she had appeared in pornographic films,\u201d the suit states. \n \n In texts, Doe and Roe talked about meeting up, but never did meet face to face again. \n \n RELATED: Students taught determining factor between sex and sexual assault is consent \n \n Investigation launched \n \n About a month later, on April 8, 2015, Roe\u2019s father called the University of Texas Police Department claiming his daughter had been sexually violated by the plaintiff. However, the department contains no record of Roe reporting any assault and no charges were pursued against the plaintiff, the suit states. \n \n But the father\u2019s call to police was referred to UT Austin\u2019s Dean of Students office, which commenced a Title IX investigation into the events, despite Roe not being an actual student at the University of Texas. \n \n On May 18, 2015, during the campus investigation, Doe told campus Title IX officials he believed he had consent from Roe because \u201cshe was talking dirty, she was enjoying it,\u201d court documents state. \n \n \u201cWe had sex and then she fell asleep and then woke up and had sex again,\u201d Doe had added. \u201cThat\u2019s when she told me she had a girlfriend and that she had done a porn movie a few months prior. I feel like as evidence she is telling me all this personal stuff about her, it\u2019s not just me raping this drunk girl.\u201d \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t remember her puking at all,\u201d Doe also told investigators of Roe. \u201cThere was a time when she passed out and I had written her off then. After she passed out, (Ms. Smith) let me chill on the couch so I didn\u2019t have to walk home. Nothing after that would have happened if (Ms. Smith) hadn\u2019t invited me back into the bedroom.\u201d \n \n But the campus Title IX investigators, also named as defendants in the suit, found that the plaintiff \u201chad sexually assaulted another student \u2026\u201d court documents state. \n \n RELATED: Student expelled for \u2018gray rape\u2019 accusation settles lawsuit against university \n \n Due process in question \n \n In November 2015, Doe received word that his expulsion had been recommended for violating the institutional rules of the college, but that he would be granted a hearing to contest the recommendation. \n \n The lawsuit argues that there was gender bias by investigators against the plaintiff in violation of Title IX, and that the hearing Doe has been afforded has such strict rules on presenting evidence that it hampers his due process rights under state law. For example, he cannot cross examine Roe. He cannot subpoena witnesses. \n \n \u201cStudents have a protected liberty interest in public higher education, and therefore cannot be deprived of that protected liberty interest without due course [due process] of law,\u201d it adds. \n \n Due course of law in the state is provided by the Texas Constitution. It directly states: \u201cNo citizen of this State shall be deprived of life, liberty, property, privileges or immunities, or in any manner disfranchised, except by the due course of law of the land.\u201d \n \n What\u2019s more, according to the lawsuit, the university\u2019s \u201cdefinition and application of the term \u2018consent\u2019 in the context of sexual assault disciplinary actions is so broad that the University may expel a student without proving that there were any objective indicators of non-consent from the alleged victim.\u201d \n \n The plaintiff\u2019s attorney is Brian Roark, an Austin-based lawyer known for successfully defending former Texas Longhorn football player Kendall Sanders, who was found not guilty of sexual assault last October. Sanders had been kicked off the team after his arrest in July 2014 and faced two to 20 years in prison if convicted. \n \n Roark did not respond to a request for comment from The College Fix on when the judge is expected to rule on the request to halt the expulsion proceedings against Doe. \n \n RELATED: Rape accusers sue University of Tennessee for giving accused students due process \n \n Like The College Fix on Facebook / Follow us on Twitter \n \n IMAGE: Shutterstock ||||| A physics major one semester away from graduation is suing to stop University of Texas-Austin from expelling him based on the unproven accusation he sexually assaulted a woman in a drunken, off-campus encounter. \n \n In one of the latest cases of male college students turning to the courts after being punished by public universities for being accused of sexual assaults, the 21-year-old man identified as John Doe in legal papers claims the school is violating his Constitutional right to due process. His alleged victim, who did not attend the school, never filed a police report, according to his lawyer, yet the school took action based on her father\u2019s complaint. \n \n \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing here is a nationwide movement that has gone too far in what the system sees as victims of campus assaults,\u201d said Brian Roark. \"Give us a fair hearing, and we'll deal with the consequences.\" \n \n \u201cMy law office gets phone calls every day from students who want to defend their right to due process.\u201d - Andrew Miltenberg \n \n Doe, who claims the sex was consensual, is facing a disciplinary hearing that could result in his expulsion, The College Fix reported. He filed the suit about two months ago with the goal of clearing his name. \n \n The alleged incident occurred on March 6, 2015, after a night of heavy drinking at a house party where Doe met two unnamed women, according to the lawsuit. The three spent the night at an off-campus apartment belonging to one of the women, where Doe had sex with one woman that night and the other the next morning, according to the lawsuit. \n \n The father of the woman who had sex with Doe the next morning told campus police of the encounter a month later, prompting a school investigation. Doe told investigators that the woman was enthusiastic about the encounter and talked about being in a pornographic movie. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not just me raping this drunk girl,\u201d Doe told investigators, according to the lawsuit. \n \n But the alleged victim later told her friend, who had had sex with Doe hours earlier, that she was still intoxicated from the previous night and was in fact unconscious during sex. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t remember throwing up, or coming home, or having this random \u2026 guy in my bed,\u201d the alleged victim texted her friend, according to the lawsuit. \u201cI didn\u2019t want this guy.

In that letter, the federal government threatened to withhold funding under the gender equity law known as Title IX if schools did not demonstrate they were taking serious action to halt the epidemic of sexual assaults on campus. \n \n While proponents say the federal efforts have protected women on campus, critics say it sparked a rush to judgment against young men who can have their lives ruined by unproven accusations. \n \n \"The university has been placed under enormous political pressure to appear tough on those accused of sexual assault and as a result have adopted a practice of expelling males from the university without regard to the rights of the accused student of the evidence,\u201d the lawsuit states. \n \n Roark said UT-Austin's policy barred Doe from having legal representation, cross-examining the accuser or even calling on testimony from corroborating witnesses, including the other woman. He scoffed at the \u201c27-year-old education grads\u201d he said typically staff the school-run probes. \n \n UT-Austin declined to comment, citing a policy of not discussing ongoing litigation or student discipline. \n \n Dozens of young men are going to court to seek relief from punishment and reputational damage meted out by schools for alleged sexual assaults, according to Inside Higher Ed. As of November, there are more than 50 pending lawsuits filed by men who claim they were unfairly expelled from college after being accused of sexual assault. \n \n \u201cI think you can have a system that encourages victims to come forward while protecting the rights of the accused,\u201d Andrew Miltenberg, a lawyer who specializes in campus assault due process, told FoxNews.com. \u201cBut are we there yet? No.\u201d \n \n Miltenberg gained national attention when he represented a Columbia University student accused of raping a fellow student who went on to conduct a campaign against the man by carrying a mattress around campus and making a video re-enactment of her alleged rape. \n \n Paul Nungesser was cleared of rape charges, but is now suing the school in federal court for failing to stop Emma Sulkowicz from harassing him. Sulkowicz, with the help of three friends, carried the mattress when she received her diploma during graduation to the cheers of fellow students. \n \n Nungesser\u2019s mother, who was at the graduation ceremony, told Newsweek, \u201cI would have liked to go to every single parent in that audience and say, \u2018I am the mother of Paul, and I am very proud of my son, and I hope you discuss with your sons and daughters what they did to him.\u201d \n \n In one of the first of its kind, the U.S. District Court in Rhode Island on Monday ruled to allow a former student\u2019s lawsuit to proceed against Brown University, alleging that the school violated his due process and discriminated against him based on gender during a wrongful sexual misconduct investigation. \n \n \u201cMy law office gets phone calls every day from students who want to defend their right to due process,\u201d Miltenberg said. \u201cThe courts are going to have to see enough of these that there is a sense across the country that, Wait, this is coming up too much, there really must be something wrong.\u201d \n \n Edmund DeMarche is a news editor for FoxNews.com.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A 21-year-old University of Texas-Austin student is suing the school to keep from being expelled one semester before graduating after being accused of raping a woman, Fox News reports. His lawsuit claims a disciplinary hearing scheduled to decide his fate violates \"his Constitutional right to due process.\" The College Fix explains the unnamed student won't be able to call witnesses or cross-examine the alleged victim during the hearing. The school has already recommended he be expelled. The alleged sexual assault took place last March after the student met two women at a house party and went home with them. He had sex with one of the women that night before having sex with the alleged victim in the morning. The lawsuit states the student believed the alleged victim was consenting to sex, in part, because she \"talked about being in a pornographic movie.\" But she later texted her friend that she was still unconscious from heavy drinking the night before and didn't remember having sex with the student. The lawsuit points out the alleged victim never filed a police report (she did talk to campus police, and her father later complained to the school) and claims she later told her friend the sex must have been consensual because it sounded \"passionate\" even though she didn't remember it. The University of Texas-Austin released a report Monday detailing how its officers deal with sexual-assault allegations, according to the Texas Tribune. \u201cTrauma victims often omit, exaggerate, or make up information when trying to make sense of what happened to them or to fill gaps in memory,\u201d the report states. \u201cThis does not mean the sexual assault did not occur.\u201d",

Moreover, the NFL has downplayed and misrepresented the issues and misled players concerning the risks associated with concussions.\" \n \n Regarding these claims, the NFL has repeatedly stated that player safety is a priority.

According to the lawsuit, 12 cases of CTE have been detected in deceased NFL players. \n \n Former Green Bay Packer Dorsey Levens, who McGlamry also represents, says that when he played in the mid-1990s, he had no idea of the consequences the game could have. He filed suit in December 2011. \n \n At the time of the filing, Levens told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, \"I wasn't worried at all, you know, because that's the way you play the game of football.

Now the Center wants to examine the brain of Junior Seau. \n \n Peter King reports that the researchers in Boston are attempting to obtain Seau\u2019s brain. \n \n The death of Seau, who killed himself with a gunshot to the chest, has reminded many of the death of former NFL player Dave Duerson, who also killed himself with a gunshot to the chest and who left a note asking for his brain to be examined to see whether the depression that plagued him late in life could be linked to brain damage he suffered on the football field. The Boston researchers determined that Duerson did, in fact, show signs of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, a progressive degenerative disease of the brain found in people with a history of repetitive brain trauma. \n \n One of the rather shocking developments in football over the last couple years has been the way the words \u201cchronic traumatic encephalopathy\u201d have seeped into the lexicon. It\u2019s long been accepted that if you follow football you know that ACL stands for anterior cruciate ligament and MCL stands for medial collateral ligament. Knowing that CTE stands for chronic traumatic encephalopathy feels different, feels like something we can\u2019t just accept as part of the cost of doing business in the NFL. \n \n If the Boston researchers find that Seau suffered from CTE, and if they believe that CTE precipitated Seau\u2019s suicide, that could be a watershed moment in the way we view the sport, and its effect on those who play it. This is research that should be done, even if it reveals information that makes all of us very uncomfortable about the game we love.",

She was initially arrested May 1, 2015 and has remained free on bond since then. \n \n Laird on March 29, 2015 gave birth to a baby girl at UAB Medical West, court records show. Routine newborn testing performed on the day the baby was born turned up positive for opiates and amphetamines, both controlled substances. The baby on April 6, 2015 was transferred to Princeton Baptist Medical Center where she received treatment for the withdrawals. \n \n Pleasant Grove police Lt. Danny Reid said Laird later admitted to detectives that she used heroin one to two times a week for at least five months of her pregnancy. Because of the severity of the baby's illness, Reid sought, and received, an enhanced charge of chemical endangerment of a child against Laird, which is a Class B felony. \n \n Laird does not have custody of her daughter. \"You won't know you've truly victimized this child until much later in life when she has trouble in school, trouble functioning,'' Reid said. \n \n She also faces an unrelated drug possession charge after she was arrested again less than two months after her daughter's birth. In that case, she and a man were pulled over during a traffic stop in Tarrant, records show. The man she was with was arrested on an outstanding warrant. A search of the vehicle turned up 38 hydrocodone pills. Neither Laird nor the man claimed ownership of those pills. \n \n In an affidavit claiming hardship to qualify for a court-appointed attorney, Laird said cleans houses for a living and is self-employed. In those records, she listed her monthly living expenses at $450 and her monthly disposable income at $50. Her only possessions of value, she wrote, is a television and bed valued at a combined $200. \n \n Laird is set to be in court on the child endangerment charge in July. ||||| WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Friday signed into law a measure that pledges greater efforts to protect drug-dependent newborns and assist their parents. \n \n A sign marks the entrance to the Neonatal Therapeutic Unit at Cabell Huntington Hospital, where staff members have acted to treat an alarming number of drug-dependent newborns, in Huntington, West Virginia, October 19, 2015. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst \n \n The Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act also stresses drug treatment and overdose prevention to help stanch the nation\u2019s heroin and opioid drug epidemic. \n \n Obama said in a statement that 78 Americans die from opioid overdose every day, and noted that the legislation included only modest steps to address the epidemic. \n \n \u201cI am deeply disappointed that Republicans failed to provide any real resources for those seeking addiction treatment to get the care that they need,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIn fact, they blocked efforts by Democrats to include $920 million in treatment funding.\u201d \n \n The bill was passed nearly unanimously by both the House of Representatives and the Senate. \n \n Efforts to enforce provisions to protect newborns and help their parents come in response to a Reuters investigation last year titled \u201cHelpless & Hooked.\u201d \n \n The new law requires that the federal government and every state follow a 2003 law that was routinely ignored. That law called on states to require hospitals and social services to report, track and assist drug-dependent newborns and their families. \n \n Reuters found that no more than nine states were following that requirement. Most children born to addicted mothers, including many mothers who were taking prescribed methadone, were not being reported by hospitals as required by law. Often, that was because medical workers feared involving child protective services, as the existing law requires. When cases were reported to social services, Reuters found, efforts to protect the child and help the parents often were limited. \n \n The failures came at a cost. Reuters found more than 110 babies since 2010 died under preventable circumstances after being sent home to families ill-equipped to care for them. Experts said far more children have likely died but gone uncounted. \n \n The new law promises a non-punitive approach that includes \u201csafe care plans\u201d aimed at keeping newborns at home with their parents, who will receive additional help. \n \n \u201cThis is a step forward for vulnerable babies who, due to an opioid dependency, will begin their lives facing enormous challenges,\u201d said Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, the ranking Democrat on the Senate subcommittee on children and families. \u201cReuters\u2019 initial reporting shined a light on a darkness that had enveloped far too many lives. There is much more work to do but this is a genuine step forward.\u201d \n \n Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican who chairs the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, which initiated the measure, said it will track state actions. \n \n \u201cThese reforms are an important part of our broader efforts to combat the nation\u2019s opioid epidemic and provide these vulnerable families a better chance at a brighter future,\u201d Kline said in a statement. \n \n In 2013, the latest year with nationwide hospital reporting, 27,315 babies were diagnosed with newborn drug withdrawal syndrome, a five-fold increase from a decade earlier. \n \n Reuters found that one drug-dependent baby was born on average every 19 minutes in the United States. Some suffer shaking, crying and feeding problems as they battle withdrawal. \n \n Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the broader addiction law was \u201cno more than a half measure\u201d without more funding. Wyden has co-sponsored a measure setting aside money for substance abuse treatment for parents in danger of losing their children. It passed the House but stalled in the Senate. \n \n Jim Greenwood, a former Pennsylvania congressman who championed the 2003 law, said the deaths Reuters revealed represent \u201ca national disgrace and glaring failure at the federal, state and local level to implement Plans of Safe Care for infants.\u201d Greenwood, now president of a Washington, D.C.-based biotechnology group, applauded the new measure \u201cto improve the health and safety of these babies and their families.\u201d \n \n Stephen Patrick, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University and leading researcher on the condition, said the new law is \u201cgood news\u201d but added: \u201cWish there was funding that came with it.\u201d ||||| A young Pleasant Grove mother indicted earlier this year after her newborn baby girl was born addicted to heroin is pregnant again and back behind bars on another child endangerment charge. \n \n Police today obtained a formal warrant against Alexandra Nicole Laird, 21, and a Jefferson County judge ordered her jailed without bond until the baby's birth. She is estimated to be between 18 to 20 weeks pregnant. \n \n \"I'm doing my damndest to try to prevent any further damage to this child, since it's obvious the mother doesn't seem to care,'' said Pleasant Grove police Lt.

A condition of her previous child endangerment charge required her to not commit any other crimes while out on bond, which Reid said she did when she failed to show up for a court hearing. She then went before a judge who revoked her bond and administered a court-ordered drug test, which was positive. \n \n She was remanded to jail in the Bessemer Cutoff on Sept. 8. It was then she admitted to using heroin three times a day, Reid said, and admitted to being pregnant which authorities confirmed with a pregnancy test. \n \n Reid went before Jefferson County Circuit Judge David Hobdy today and argued for no bond, claiming that the unborn baby's life is in danger of continued heroin exposure. \n \n \"This is a sad case, no matter how you look at it, as the mother's heroin addiction is more compelling to her than the health and welfare of this unborn child,'' Reid said. \"But make no mistake, sad or not, law enforcement will hold this mother accountable and vigorously defend and protect the well being of the child, who is innocent of all of this and simply struggling for life.\" \n \n Bessemer Cutoff District Attorney Bill Veitch agreed. \"The whole thing is just sad,'' Veitch said. \"Very sad.\"",

    "document": "India\u2019s top court has ruled that adultery is no longer a crime, declaring that the colonial-era law is unconstitutional and discriminatory against women. \n \n A five-judge bench of the supreme court unanimously ruled that the criminal offence of having a sexual relationship with a woman without her husband\u2019s consent was archaic and deprived women of agency. \n \n The case, brought by an Indian businessman living in Italy, sought to have section 497 of the Indian penal code and another similar provision made gender neutral. But the court said the offence, which carried a prison sentence of up to five years, was arbitrary and needed to go. \n \n \u201cIt is time to say husband is not the master,\u201d said the chief justice, Dipak Misra. He quoted John Stuart Mill: \u201cLegal subordination of one sex over another is wrong in itself.\u201d \n \n Indu Malhotra, one of two women among the 25 judges on the court, said: \u201cThe time when wives were invisible to the law, and lived in the shadows of their husbands, has long since gone by.\u201d \n \n There is no official data on how frequently men were prosecuted under the law, but it was often raised in divorce proceedings, lawyers say. \n \n The decision is one of several socially progressive rulings by the court this session. This month the justices ruled to decriminalise homosexuality, and on Friday they will decide on a case about whether women in their menstruating years can be restricted from entering Kerala state\u2019s Sabarimala temple. \n \n Indian court upholds legality of world's largest biometric database Read more \n \n Like the decision to legalise homosexual acts, some advocates against the adultery law characterised Thursday\u2019s decision as an act of decolonising the country\u2019s Raj-era criminal code. \n \n \u201cI welcome this judgment by the supreme court,\u201d said Rekha Sharma, the head of India\u2019s National Commission for Women. \u201cIt was an outdated law, which should have been removed long back. This is a law from British era. Although the British had done away with it long back, we were still stuck with it.\u201d \n \n The court has been more willing to affirm British-era legislation when it comes to restricting speech, in recent years endorsing imperial laws against criminal defamation and creating (but later dropping) a rule that Indians must stand while the national anthem is played in movie theatres. \n \n \u201cI wouldn\u2019t yet call it a progressive era in the court,\u201d said Gautam Bhatia, a Delhi-based lawyer and legal scholar. He said in cases such as the adultery or homosexuality rulings, the court was dispensing with laws that had clearly fallen behind social mores. \u201cThese are the low-hanging fruit,\u201d he said. \n \n Thursday\u2019s decision was decried by some prominent feminists including Swati Maliwal, Delhi\u2019s commissioner for women. She said the adultery law should have become gender neutral because it could be a deterrent against men abandoning their families, in a society where women wield little power, especially in poorer or deeply patriarchal areas of the country. \n \n \u201cThousands of women approach the commission, many from disadvantaged backgrounds, saying their husbands are acting in an adulterous manner and have left them without support to look after the children,\u201d Maliwal said. \u201cAt least with this law a woman can get a sense of justice, and the men have a kind of fear that when they enter a relationship, it has some sanctity that they have to live with. \n \n \u201cIn an ideal society I would totally agree with this judgment, but we are not talking about an ideal society,\u201d she said. \n \n Lawyers for the central government had opposed scrapping the adultery law, arguing that diluting sanctions against infidelity would \u201cresult in laxity of the marital bonds\u201d. The law had survived three previous legal challenges, the most recent in 1988. \n \n The succession of high-profile cases provides a notable send-off for Misra, an at times controversial chief justice who has been the subject of public complaints from his fellow judges over his handling of politically sensitive cases. \n \n The Delhi high court is currently examining another law that makes an exception for sexual assault if the perpetrator and victim are married. The government as well as several men\u2019s rights groups have filed petitions against scrapping the marriage exception. \n \n Karuna Nundy, a supreme court lawyer leading the case to overturn the marital rape law, said Thursday\u2019s judgment bolstered her argument. \u201cBoth laws based on the doctrine of a man owning his wife, the wife being property,\u201d she said. \n \n Nundy said the court had shown in recent judgments that it now believed \u201csexually autonomy is not forfeited at the marital door\u201d. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Under the law the woman could not be punished as an abettor - the man was considered to be a seducer \n \n India's top court has ruled adultery is no longer a crime, striking down a 158-year-old colonial-era law which it said treated women as male property. \n \n Previously any man who had sex with a married woman, without the permission of her husband, had committed a crime. \n \n A petitioner had challenged the law saying it was arbitrary and discriminated against men and women. \n \n It is not clear how many men have been prosecuted under the law - there is no data available. \n \n This is the second colonial-era law struck down by India's Supreme Court this month - it also overturned a 157-year-old law which effectively criminalised gay sex in India. \n \n While reading out the judgement on adultery, Chief Justice Dipak Misra said that while it could be grounds for civil issues like divorce, \"it cannot be a criminal offence\". \n \n Who challenged the law? \n \n Last August, Joseph Shine, a 41-year-old Indian businessman living in Italy, petitioned the Supreme Court to strike down the law. He argued that it discriminated against men by only holding them liable for extra-marital relationships, while treating women like objects. \n \n \"Married women are not a special case for the purpose of prosecution for adultery. They are not in any way situated differently than men,\" his petition said. \n \n The law, Mr Shine said, also \"indirectly discriminates against women by holding an erroneous presumption that women are the property of men\". \n \n In his 45-page petition, Mr Shine liberally quotes from American poet Ralph Waldo Emerson, women rights activist Mary Wollstonecraft and former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan on gender equality and the rights of women. \n \n Image copyright EPA Image caption Previous pleas were dismissed by the court in the interests of \"stability of marriages\" \n \n However, India's ruling BJP government had opposed the petition, insisting that adultery should remain a criminal offence. \n \n \"Diluting adultery laws will impact the sanctity of marriages. Making adultery legal will hurt marriage bonds,\" a government counsel told the court, adding that \"Indian ethos gives paramount importance to the institution and sanctity of marriage\". \n \n What did the adultery law say? \n \n The law dictated that the woman could not be punished as an abettor. Instead, the man was considered to be a seducer. \n \n It also did not allow women to file a complaint against an adulterous husband. \n \n A man accused of adultery could be sent to a prison for a maximum of five years, made to pay a fine, or both. \n \n And although there is no information on actual convictions under the law, Kaleeswaram Raj, a lawyer for the petitioner, said the adultery law was \"often misused\" by husbands during matrimonial disputes such as divorce, or civil cases relating to wives receiving maintenance. \n \n \"Men would often file criminal complaints against suspected or imagined men who they would allege were having affairs with their wives. These charges could never be proved, but ended up smearing the reputations of their estranged or divorced partners,\" he told the BBC. \n \n Interestingly, Indian folklore and epics are full of stories about extra-marital love. Most love poems in Sanskrit, according to scholar J Moussaief Masson, are \"about illicit love\". \n \n But Manusmriti, an ancient Hindu text, says: \"If men persist in seeking intimate contact with other men's wives, the king should brand them with punishments that inspire terror and banish them\". \n \n What did the judges say? \n \n All five Supreme Court judges hearing the case said the law was archaic, arbitrary and unconstitutional. \n \n \"Husband is not the master of wife. Women should be treated with equality along with men,\" Chief Justice Misra said. \n \n Judge Rohinton Nariman said that \"ancient notions of man being perpetrator and woman being victim no longer hold good\". \n \n Justice DY Chandrachud said the law \"perpetuates subordinate status of women, denies dignity, sexual autonomy, is based on gender stereotypes\". \n \n He said the law sought to \"control sexuality of woman (and) hits the autonomy and dignity of woman\". \n \n Critics have called the law \"staggeringly sexist\", \"'crudely anti-woman'\", and \"'violative of the right to equality'\". \n \n \"The legal system should not regulate whom one sleeps with,\" wrote Rashmi Kalia, who teaches law. \n \n The main concern, according to the respected journal Economic and Political Weekly, is \"not whether the expectations of fidelity in a marriage are right or wrong, or whether adultery denotes sexual freedom.\" \n \n \"It is whether the state can and should monitor a relationship between adults that is too complex, sensitive and individual for it to be capable of doing in a just manner,\" the journal wrote in a recent editorial. \n \n Where else is adultery a criminal offence? \n \n Image copyright Mansi Thapliyal Image caption The latest challenge was made in view of the \"changed social conditions\" \n \n Adultery is considered illegal in 21 American states, including New York, although surveys show that while most Americans disapprove of adultery, they don't think of it as a crime. \n \n \"The criminal statutes remain in force for largely symbolic reasons, and there isn't enough enforcement risk for anyone to incur the political costs of repealing them,\" Deborah Rhode, a professor of law at Stanford University and the author of Adultery: Infidelity and the Law told the BBC. \n \n Adultery is prohibited in Sharia or Islamic Law, so it is a criminal offence in Islamic countries such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Somalia. \n \n Taiwan punishes adultery by up to a year in prison and it is also deemed a crime in Indonesia. In fact, Indonesia is drafting laws that prohibit all consensual sex outside the institution of marriage. \n \n In 2015, South Korea's Supreme Court struck down a similar law where a man could be sent to prison for two years or less for adultery. The court said the law violated self-determination and privacy. \n \n More than 60 countries around the world had done away with laws that made adultery a crime, according to Indian lawyer Kaleeswaram Raj. \n \n In the UK, adultery is not a criminal offence and like many other countries, one of the main reasons given for divorce. \n \n Couples cannot use adultery as a ground for divorce if they lived together as a couple for six months after the infidelity was known about. \n \n Have there been previous challenges to the law? \n \n In 1954, the law was first challenged by a petitioner asking why women cannot be punished for the offence, and that such \"exemption was discriminatory\". \n \n Image copyright Mansi Thapliyal Image caption Critics have called the law \"violative of right to equality\" \n \n The Supreme Court rejected the plea. \n \n Since then, the top court has rejected similar pleas, including the constitutional validity of the law, at least twice - 1985 and 1988. \n \n \"The stability of marriage is not an ideal to be scorned,\" a judge said in 1985. \n \n A married woman had approached the court, demanding the right to file a complaint of adultery against her husband's unmarried lover. The court, rather patronisingly, described the plea as a \"crusade by a woman against a woman\". \n \n It said the law was about punishing the \"outsider\" who \"breaks into the matrimonial home\" and \"violates its sanctity\". \n \n Two different panels on law reforms in 1971 and 2003 recommended that women should also be prosecuted for the offence. \n \n \"The society abhors marital infidelity. Therefore there is no good reason for not meting out similar treatment to the wife who has sexual intercourse with a married man,\" the 2003 panel, led by a judge, said. \n \n In 2011, the top court, hearing another plea, said the law was facing criticism for \"showing a strong gender bias, it makes the position of a married woman almost as a property of her husband\". \n \n What has the reaction been to the latest ruling? \n \n Many Indians were not even aware the law existed. However, after Thursday's ruling, people have been largely supportive of the verdict. \n \n Others said the top court should now move to make marital rape a criminal offence: \n \n But a few felt that the law should have been made gender neutral instead of being struck down:",

Long criticized as archaic and sexist, it made it illegal for a man to have sex with a married woman without the permission of her husband. Misra said that while adultery could certainly be an issue in civil cases like divorce, \"it cannot be a criminal offense.\" The law had been challenged three previous times, most recently in 1988. \"I welcome this judgment by the supreme court,\" says Rekha Sharma, the head of India\u2019s National Commission for Women. \"It was an outdated law, which should have been removed long back.\" She notes that the law dated from the British colonial era\u2014but the British got rid of their version of the law many years ago. Government lawyers had urged the court to keep the law, arguing that \"making adultery legal will hurt marriage bonds.\" The Guardian reports that those who brought the case had only sought to make the law gender neutral, but the court decided to simply get rid of it.

    "document": "A policy intended to achieve racial equality at a north Mississippi school has long meant that only white kids can run for some class offices one year, black kids the next. But Brandy Springer, a mother of four mixed race children, was stunned when she moved to the area from Florida and learned her 12-year-old daughter couldn't run for class reporter because she wasn't the right race. \n \n The rules sparked an outcry on blogs and other websites after Springer contacted an advocacy group for mixed-race families. The NAACP called for a Justice Department investigation _ not surprising in a state with a history of racial tension dating to the Jim Crow era. \n \n By Friday afternoon, the Nettleton School District announced on its website that it would no longer use race in school elections. \n \n Superintendent Russell Taylor posted a statement saying the practice had been in place for 30 years, dating back to a time when school districts across Mississippi came under close scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department over desegregation. \n \n \"It is the belief of the current administration that these procedures were implemented to help ensure minority representation and involvement in the student body,\" the statement said. \"It is our hope and desire that these practices and procedures are no longer needed.\" \n \n Springer, who moved to Lee County from Florida in April, said her daughter was told the office of sixth-grade class reporter at Nettleton Middle School was available only to black students this year. \n \n Her anger grew when she saw school election guidelines that allowed only whites to run for class president this year. In alternating years, the positions would be reversed so blacks could run for president and whites could hold other positions, district officials said. \n \n Even if the rule is an attempt to ensure black and white participation, Springer said diversity is no longer a black and white issue, with a growing number of mixed-race children, Hispanics and other ethnicities attending school together. \n \n The school agreed, saying it the statement that it \"acknowledges and embraces the fact that we are growing in ethnic diversity and that the classifications of Caucasian and African-American no longer reflect our entire student body.\" \n \n Springer is white. Her two older children, including the sixth grader, are half Native American. Her two younger children have a black father. \n \n \"How are they supposed to be classified?\" she asked. \n \n \"My main concern is that the object of school is to prepare people for life. An employer could never do this: Advertise a position for a white man only or a black man only,\" she said. \"This is not a lesson we want to teach.\" \n \n The changes in school elections may have come too late for Springer. Springer said she moved to another school district last week and pulled her kids from Nettleton Middle School. \n \n School administrators did not immediately respond to messages seeking further comment left Friday by The Associated Press. \n \n Nettleton is a town of about 2,000 people with a population that is about 66 percent white and 32 percent black. \n \n Springer's plight demonstrates the complexities faced not only by interracial families, but by school officials trying to achieve racial equality in a state known for tensions between blacks and whites. The school district also manipulated prom and homecoming elections so that the outcome is an equal division of blacks and whites. \n \n Springer and others worried that could leave out Hispanics, Asians or any other student from another race or ethnicity, Springer said. \n \n Springer's story spread rapidly on the Internet after she contacted a website for mixed families _ mixedandhappy.com. \n \n Suzy Richardson, the website's founder and the mother of four mixed-race children, said she and her husband have \"raised our children to tell them they are black and white. They're half of me and half of dad.\" \n \n \"It really made me upset (to hear Springer's story). The message that were sending to kids is that they have to choose one side of who they are,\" she said. \"The message that we're sending our children is that we do things based on race.\" \n \n Before the school announced it was changing its practices, Charles Hampton, a vice president of the Mississippi NAACP, said he would ask the U.S. Justice Department to investigate. \n \n \"That's something that shouldn't be happening anywhere in America, but we still have pockets of it happening at certain schools,\" Hampton said. \"The local community needs to get involved and demand they change the policy.\" ||||| If we still have segregated proms in the American South, including in Mississippi, why not segregated middle school elections? Welcome to Nettleton Middle School, where not only are class elections segregated, but the president slots are designated for white students. \n \n But even segregated proms have an apparent black equivalent. In this middle school class officers election, there's no pretense of separate but equal: The highest a black student can aspire to is vice president of just one of the classes. Because it's not like a black person can be president or anything! \n \n Mixed And Happy, an online community for mixed-race families, first got wind of the situation from a parent at the school, who also found out that there are segregated prom and homecoming kings and queens. Among the many things that are wrong with this scenario is the fact that multiracial students, or those who are neither black or white, are erased. As the mother, Brandy, wrote Mixed And Happy, \n \n Advertisement \n \n \"My son and daughter that go to this middle school are Native American and Italian. But, we also have 3- and 6- year olds that are African American and Italian. I would like to know which category they would lump them in. I have always taught my children not to see race. This is so disgusting to me.\" \n \n Brandy's daughter had wanted to be class 'reporter,\" but because her mother is white and her father is black, she wasn't eligible for the black-designated position. When Brandy complained to the School Board, \"They told me that they 'Go by the mother's race b/c with minorities the father isn't generally in the home.' They also told me that 'a city court order is the reason why it is this way.'\" \n \n Late last night, the principal of the school posted a statement on its website: \n \n Sponsored \n \n \"Student elections have not yet been held at Nettleton Middle School for the 2010-2011 school term. The processes and procedures for student elections are under review. We are reviewing the origin of these processes, historical applications, compliance issues, as well as current implications and ramifications. A statement will be released when review of these processes is complete.\" \n \n Apparently it's just come to their attention that they're systematically racist! Thanks, Internet. \n \n Update: More details on the school, including its handbook-mandated homecoming segregation and black principal, as well as further comments from the mother who first complained. \n \n : Second Update: The school has reversed its policy, saying it was a rotation put into place 30 years ago to ensure diversity. \n \n Class President?

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n May 8, 2018, 5:33 PM GMT / Updated May 8, 2018, 8:32 PM GMT By Jonathan Allen, Alex Moe and Frank Thorp V \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he is withdrawing the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, reneging on a landmark pact and raising fears that Tehran might respond by resuming its frozen weapons program. \n \n \"It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of the current agreement,\" Trump said in a nationally televised statement from the White House. \"The United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.\" \n \n Trump further said that he would impose the \"highest level\" of sanctions, which would affect not only Iran but other countries that do business with it. The Treasury Department said a series of primary and secondary sanctions \u2014 those affecting American and foreign partners of Iran \u2014 would go back into effect after wind-down periods specified by law. \n \n In 2015, Iran agreed to halt its pursuit of nuclear weapons \u2014 and to allow for international checks on its facilities \u2014 in exchange for moves by the U.S., several other countries and the United Nations to roll back sanctions that had crippled its economy. The accord was widely seen as the biggest foreign policy accomplishment of President Barack Obama's administration. \n \n But Trump has long been a critic of the agreement \u2014 calling it the \"worst deal ever\" \u2014 maintaining that Obama gave up too much for too little. His decision signals a dramatic reversal of U.S. policy, and his rhetoric was hawkish. \n \n The move also raises two important questions for the Trump administration and the international community: Whether Iran will respond by resuming its quest for nuclear weapons \u2014 and whether reneging on the Iran pact might affect North Korea's willingness to cut a denuclearization deal of its own with the president. \n \n U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was in the air on his way to North Korea during the announcement, Trump said. Critics of Tuesday's move said Trump is giving North Korea little reason to trust him. \n \n \"In a democracy, there will always be changes in policies and priorities from one Administration to the next,\" Obama said in a statement Tuesday calling Trump's actions \"misguided\" and harmful to America's standing in the world. \"But the consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding America's credibility, and puts us at odds with the world's major powers.\" \n \n Meanwhile, French President Emanuel Macron, who spoke with Trump Tuesday morning before the announcement, tweeted his \"regret\" over the president's decision. \"The nuclear non-proliferation regime is at stake,\" he wrote. \n \n The withdrawal of the U.S. leaves a big hole at the negotiating table after Trump had sought over the past six months to force a new deal by threatening to scrap the existing one. \n \n Still, some in the administration and outside it were hopeful that his declaration would create pressure on Iran and America's partners in that deal \u2014 Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China \u2014 to negotiate a new agreement in which Iran abandons its ballistic missile development, funding of terrorist groups, stated quest to destroy Israel and cyber-attacks on the U.S. and its allies. \n \n That group included some American critics of Trump's move, including members of his own party, who expressed hope that the U.S. would be a part of a renegotiated agreement in the coming months. \n \n \"Without proof that Iran is in violation of the agreement, it is a mistake to fully withdraw from this deal,\" said Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee. \"Now, we need to work with our allies to fix this flawed agreement to ensure the world is not facing a nuclear Iran.\u201d \n \n For his part, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Tuesday that his country would remain engaged with the other signatories to the original deal. \n \n \"We've known for months that President Trump wouldn't be committed to this deal,\" he said. \"The Iranian foreign ministry will continue talks with remaining countries in the deal.\" \n \n It is difficult to say exactly how Trump\u2019s maneuver is likely to play out over time. The U.S. sanctions are complex, and only part of the international picture. Moreover, the reactions of each country involved in the original deal are difficult to predict precisely \u2014 including that of Iran itself: Even if Tehran doesn\u2019t kick-start its nuclear weapons program, its leaders could banish inspectors. \n \n In the meantime, foreign countries and companies will be risking their ability to do business in the U.S. if they continue to buy Iranian oil. \n \n Iran initially came to the negotiating table because of the pain caused by economic sanctions imposed by Congress, a series of U.S. presidents, several foreign nations and the United Nations. \n \n Proponents of the deal say that it has worked \u2014 that Iran has kept its promises to halt the nuclear weapons program and to allow international vetting of its energy capabilities. \n \n But Trump campaigned on rewriting the pact, and in a speech to the U.N. last year, called it a major \"embarrassment\" and \"one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.\" \n \n Until Tuesday, though, he had taken a more measured approach to the deal. Last October, in declining to certify that Iran had lived up to its end of the bargain, Trump kicked a decision on whether to re-impose U.S. sanctions to Congress \u2014 which did not act. \n \n Trump pushed the call to Congress, even though he always has had the power to re-impose sanctions through executive action and perhaps because he knew it was unlikely Congress would be capable of agreeing to anything. \n \n Back then, his national security adviser was H.R. McMaster, who was considered a moderate on Iran. Now, though \u2014 with leading Iran critic John Bolton newly installed in McMaster's old role \u2014 Trump has decided to take on Tehran, a decision that has worried America's European allies. \n \n Trump's announcement did draw a positive response from some, including many congressional Republicans and the Saudi government \u2014 whose U.S. ambassador tweeted that it \"fully supports the measures\" \u2014 and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who gave a much-publicized presentation late last month in which he accused Iran of violating the deal because it hadn't shared pre-existing plans for nuclear weapons with the international community. \n \n In his remarks Tuesday, Trump pointed to thousands of documents detailing the program that Israeli intelligence operatives had spirited from Iran. In a televised address following Trump's speech, Netanyahu praised the president for his \"courageous leadership.\" ||||| In this photo released by an official website of the office of the Iranian Presidency, President Hassan Rouhani attends a meeting with officials and industrialists, at a petroleum conference in Tehran,...

Israel has neither confirmed nor denied involvement. It has warned it will not tolerate archenemy Iran establishing itself militarily on its doorstep. \n \n ___ \n \n 1:40 p.m. \n \n Iran's state-run news agency is quoting an anonymous official saying President Hassan Rouhani (hah-SAHN' roh-HAH'-nee) will give a televised address after President Donald Trump announces his intention to pull America out of the Iran nuclear deal. \n \n IRNA filed the report late Tuesday, just ahead of Trump's speech from the White House's Diplomatic Room. \n \n IRNA offered no other immediate details. \n \n __ \n \n 12:55 p.m. \n \n President Donald Trump is following through on his campaign threat and withdrawing the U.S. from the landmark nuclear accord with Iran. \n \n That's according to two people familiar with the decision, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record. They did not have any details on how the withdrawal would unfold. \n \n Trump is expected to make the announcement Tuesday afternoon. \n \n It wasn't immediately clear which sanctions lifted under the deal that Trump plans to immediately re-impose. He has several options. A more limited move could leave Trump more room to potentially stay in the deal if other members agree to toughen it. \n \n The president has long criticized the 2015 agreement, which lifted most U.S. and international sanctions against the country. In return, Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear program making it impossible to produce a bomb, along with rigorous inspections. \n \n The decision deals a profound blow to some of America's closest allies \u2014 including Britain, France and Germany, who joined the U.S. only three years ago to sign the deal.",

The move also raises two important questions for the Trump administration and the international community: Whether Iran will respond by resuming its quest for nuclear weapons\u2014and whether reneging on the Iran pact might affect North Korea's willingness to cut a denuclearization deal of its own with the president.

It\u2019s also not clear the immediate impact the grant freeze would have on programs across the country, since EPA grants are distributed at varying intervals and frequency. \n \n \u201cI will say it\u2019s pretty unusual for us to get these kinds of anonymous contacts from people at the agency, which makes me think it\u2019s unusual,\u201d said the Hill source. \n \n A source who works closely with states and territories on EPA grants said they heard from the agency on Tuesday evening that a review of grants would be done by Friday. \n \n Neither the Trump transition office nor the central press office at the EPA responded to a request for comment Monday. \n \n The Huffington Post received a message that was reportedly sent to staff Monday that seems to cover the current agency guidance on talking to the press in general, not just about the directive on grants. The memo states that the agency is imposing tight controls on external communication, including press releases, blog posts, social media and content on the agency website. \n \n I just returned from a briefing for Communication Directors where the following information was provided. These restrictions are effective immediately and will remain in place until further direction is received from the new Administration\u2019s Beach Team.

Trump appointed Myron Ebell, the director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the libertarian think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute and a fierce EPA critic, to oversee the transition work at the agency. Axios reported Monday that the Trump team plans to cut $815 million from the agency\u2019s budget, for programs like states and tribal assistance grants, climate programs and other \u201cenvironment programs and management.\u201d \n \n Pruitt has a long history of battling the agency over environmental regulations as the attorney general of Oklahoma, describing himself as \u201ca leading advocate against the EPA\u2019s activist agenda.\u201d \n \n In a report later Monday night, ProPublica confirmed the freeze in an interview and reported it also includes EPA contracts. Ebell told ProPublica the freeze is to \u201cmake sure nothing happens they don\u2019t want to have happen.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis may be a little wider than some previous administrations, but it\u2019s very similar to what others have done,\u201d he said. \n \n But a former Obama administration EPA official tells HuffPost that while \u201cit is completely normal for incoming administrations to come in and take stock of what\u2019s happening across an agency,\u201d the Trump administration\u2019s moves so far are \u201cextreme, and very troubling, especially when it comes to both the grant freeze and the public communications.\u201d \n \n \u201cWhen it comes to the grants freeze, this could be especially problematic at the state level. EPA sends a huge amount of its budget to the states, where it is ultimately spent,\u201d said the official. \u201cThat\u2019s where you could ultimately see the most negative impacts, especially at times when states are already suffering budget challenges. Time will tell, but this is not a great start when it comes to supporting states or transparency and a commitment to sharing important information with the public.\u201d \n \n HuffPost also reported Tuesday that staffers at several other federal agencies, including the Department of Agriculture and Health and Human Services, have also been told to shut down external communication for the time being. \n \n Do you work in a federal agency?

(Matt McClain/ The Washington Post) \n \n The Trump administration has instructed officials at the Environmental Protection Agency to freeze its grants and contracts, a move that could affect everything from state-led climate research to localized efforts to improve air and water quality to environmental justice projects aimed at helping poor communities. \n \n An email went out to employees in the agency\u2019s Office of Acquisition Management within hours of President Trump\u2019s swearing-in on Friday. \n \n \u201cNew EPA administration has asked that all contract and grant awards be temporarily suspended, effective immediately,\u201d read the email, which was shared with The Washington Post. \u201cUntil we receive further clarification, which we hope to have soon, please construe this to include task orders and work assignments.\u201d \n \n According to its website, each year the EPA awards more than $4 billion in funding for grants and other assistance agreements. For now, it appears, that funding is on hold, casting a cloud of uncertainty over one of the agency\u2019s core functions, as well as over the scientists, state and local officials, universities and Native American tribes that often benefit from the grants. \n \n President Trump signed an executive order formally withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, an order establishing a federal hiring freeze and a third order reinstating the \"Mexico City policy,\" on Jan. 23 at the White House. (Reuters) \n \n \u201cEPA staff have been reviewing grants and contracts information with the incoming transition team,\u201d an agency spokesperson said in an email Tuesday. \u201cPursuant to that review, the agency is continuing to award the environmental program grants and state revolving loan fund grants to the states and tribes; and we are working to quickly address issues related to other categories of grants.\u201d The agency said the goal is to complete the grants and contracts review by the close of business Friday. \n \n It is unclear whether the move by the incoming administration was related to President Trump\u2019s order Monday that federal agencies halt hiring in all areas on the executive branch except for the military, national security and public safety, which also curbed contracting as a way of compensating for the freeze. \u201cContracting outside the Government to circumvent the intent of this memorandum shall not be permitted,\u201d the memorandum states. \n \n [Trump\u2019s regulatory freeze halts four Obama rules aimed at promoting greater energy efficiency] \n \n Administration officials inserted the language in an apparent attempt to curb the growth in federal contracts that arose during previous freezes imposed under Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. But the total halt in contracts and grants for a single agency appeared to go beyond that specific provision, which applied solely to contracting activities in response to the halt in hiring. \n \n Myron Ebell, who oversaw the EPA transition for the new administration, told ProPublica on Monday that the freezing of grants and contracts was not unprecedented. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re trying to freeze things to make sure nothing happens they don\u2019t want to have happen, so any regulations going forward, contracts, grants, hires, they want to make sure to look at them first,\u201d said Ebell, director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, an industry-backed group that has long sought to slash the authority of the EPA. \n \n \u201cThis may be a little wider than some previous administrations, but it\u2019s very similar to what others have done,\u201d he told the publication. \n \n But not in recent history has such a blanket freeze taken place, and one employee told ProPublica he did not recall anything like it in nearly a decade with the agency. \n \n The move is likely to increase anxieties inside an already tense agency. Ebell and other transition officials have made little secret about their goal of greatly reducing the EPA\u2019s footprint and regulatory reach. Trump has repeatedly criticized the EPA for what he calls a string of onerous, expensive regulations that are hampering businesses. And his nominee to run the agency, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, has repeatedly sued the EPA over the years, challenging its legal authority to regulate everything from mercury pollution to various wetlands and waterways to carbon emissions from power plants. \n \n 1 of 83 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 A look at President Trump\u2019s first 100 days View Photos The beginning of the president\u2019s term has featured controversial executive orders and frequent conflicts with the media.

The new EPA administration has asked that all contract and grant awards be temporarily suspended, effective immediately. Until we receive further clarification, this includes task orders and work assignments.\u201d \n \n Asked about any possible freeze and its implications, EPA officials did not provide an answer. \n \n One EPA employee aware of the freeze said he had never seen anything like it in nearly a decade with the agency. Hiring freezes happened, he said, but freezes on grants and contracts seemed extraordinary. The employee said the freeze appeared to be nationwide, and as of Monday night it was not clear for how long it would be in place. \n \n The substance of the email exchange was confirmed by one senior EPA employee with over 20 years at the agency. An EPA lawyer also said that earlier communications had described such a freeze. \n \n Monday night, Myron Ebell, who ran the EPA transition for the incoming administration, confirmed the basics of the freeze, but said the actions were not unprecedented. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re trying to freeze things to make sure nothing happens they don\u2019t want to have happen, so any regulations going forward, contracts, grants, hires, they want to make sure to look at them first,\u201d said Ebell, who returned over the weekend to his position directing energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a free-market, industry-aligned group that has long fought the EPA\u2019s growth and influence. \n \n \u201cThis may be a little wider than some previous administrations, but it\u2019s very similar to what others have done,\u201d he said. \n \n President Trump has nominated Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt to head the EPA. Pruitt has deep ties to the fossil fuel industry, and formed an alliance between the industry and other attorneys general to fight former President Baracks Obama\u2019s climate proposals. He is seen as a hero among conservatives who believe the EPA oversteps its federal authority. \n \n Pruitt faced tough questioning and even outright skepticism during his initial confirmation hearing last week. The Washington Examiner published a statement Monday by Tom Carper, the Delaware Democrat and ranking member on the Environment and Public Works Committee, saying, \"Following the committee hearing on Scott Pruitt's nomination to head the EPA, serious questions remain about the nominee's record and vision for the agency he seeks to lead.\" \n \n Much about any freeze at the EPA remains unclear, including whether it affects only new grants and contracts, or may also affect the roughly $6.4 billion worth of federal contracts the EPA already has in place. EPA press offices across the country did not immediately respond to calls and emails requesting comment. \n \n The EPA routinely contracts out services ranging from hazardous waste handling to drinking water quality testing. More than 600 active contracts with businesses ranging from small minority-owned consulting companies to institutions as big as Colorado State University can be explored here. \n \n The environmental agency\u2019s grants are used to support private, state and municipal level environmental testing, remediation and innovation projects. Together those programs can total more in spending than an entire year\u2019s budget for the agency. The EPA awarded roughly $1.4 billion worth of contracts and $9.6 billion in grants in 2013, the latest year for which data was available, according to the government spending website InsideGov.com. The agency\u2019s total budget in 2016 was $8.6 billion. \n \n A freeze on payments would appear consistent with other actions taken on Monday, including President Trump signing an executive order instituting a hiring freeze for new federal workers \u2014 a centerpiece of the pledge he made in his \u201cContract with the American Voter\u201d during the presidential campaign. \n \n If anyone has more information on recent events at the EPA, please contact us. \n \n Abrahm Lustgarten contributed reporting to this story.",

He went on to have 11 children. \n \n As a manager, Jackson launched the career of son Michael Jackson -- along with Jackie, Jermaine, Marlon and Tito -- out of Gary, Ind., as the Jackson 5 in the 1960s. The Jackson 5 signed with Berry Gordy's Motown Records, and in 1970, their first four singles (\"I Want You Back,\" \"ABC,\" \"The Love You Save\" and \"I'll Be There\") all went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100. They were the first act to see their first four singles top the Hot 100. \n \n Son Jermaine Jackson tweeted about his father's health on June 21. \"My father's health is not good, but 'dying' is a harsh word chosen by headline writers, not me,\" he wrote at the time. \"For however long he has left, my mother, siblings, and relatives want to be with him, without hindrance.\" \n \n But on June 24, a more ominous update was posted on Joe Jackson's Twitter page: \"I have seen more sunsets than I have left to see. The sun rises when the time comes and whether you like it or not the sun sets when the time comes.\" Shortly after that tweet went out, Paris Jackson -- Michael's daughter -- tweeted, \"this is a beautiful tweet. though it upsets me to see whoever is in charge of this account taking advantage of it. my grandfather did not tweet this. i\u2019m not sure if he\u2019s ever used this account.\" \n \n Daughter Janet Jackson spoke of her father on June 22 in a speech at the Radio Disney Music Awards in Hollywood, where she was honored with the Impact Award, now known as the Janet Jackson Award. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s humbling to be recognized as someone that has had a positive impact, but if I have been fortunate enough to impact others it is only because I, myself, have been greatly impacted by positive people in my life,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mother nourished me with the most extravagant love imaginable. My father, my incredible father, drove me to be the best that I can.\" \n \n Jackson suffered a stroke while visiting Brazil in 2015 and was again hospitalized after a car he was riding in was involved in an accident in Las Vegas in 2017. \n \n Although Jackson was known for his iron-fisted management of his children, in 2002, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame honored him as Best Entertainment Manager of All Time. \n \n \"I'm glad I was tough, because look what I came out with,\" Jackson said in an interview in 2013. \"I came out with some kids that everybody loved all over the world. And they treated everybody right.\" ||||| (CNN) Joseph \"Joe\" Jackson, the patriarch who launched the musical Jackson family dynasty, died Wednesday at a Las Vegas hospital, a source close to the family tells CNN. \n \n He was 89. \n \n Jackson was the father of and at times manager to pop stars Michael and Janet Jackson, along with the sibling singing group, The Jackson 5. \n \n No cause of death has been released, but Jackson had reportedly been in ill health. \n \n \"I have seen more sunsets than I have left to see,\" read a tweet posted Sunday from Jackson's official Twitter account. \"The sun rises when the time comes and whether you like it or not the sun sets when the time comes.\" \n \n I have seen more sunsets than I have left to see.

They moved into into a home on Jackson Street in Gary, Indiana, the following year, where they welcomed their first of 10 children, Maureen \"Rebbie\" Jackson. \n \n Rebbie was followed by Sigmund \"Jackie\" Jackson in 1951, Toriano \"Tito\" Jackson in 1953, Jermaine Jackson in 1954, La Toya Jackson in 1956, Marlon Jackson in 1957, Michael Jackson in 1958, Steven Randall \"Randy\" Jackson in 1961 and Janet Jackson in 1966. \n \n Marlon's twin, Brandon, died soon after birth. \n \n With a large family to support, Joe Jackson surrendered his dreams of becoming a boxer and secured a job as a crane operator for US Steel. \n \n He and his brother Luther formed a band in the mid-1950s called The Falcons, intent on booking gigs for extra money. \n \n The band only lasted a few years, but Jackson had developed an ear for music and believed he had found some talent in his children. He formed The Jackson Brothers in 1963 -- with sons Tito, Jackie and Jermaine -- and began entering them in local talent shows. With the addition of Marlon and Michael, The Jackson 5 was born in 1966. Two years later, they signed with Motown Records. \n \n They went on to become one of the most successful R&B groups in history, with their father initially acting as their manager. \n \n At the height of their stardom, The Jackson 5 sold millions of records and had their own CBS variety show. \n \n \"Joseph's role as manager dwindled however as Motown CEO Berry Gordy began to take more charge on his act, a role that reverted back to Joseph when he began managing the entire family for performances in Las Vegas,\" according to Jackson's official site. \"Joseph also helped his sons seal a deal with CBS after leaving Motown.\" \n \n The success of The Jackson 5 led to Michael Jackson going solo, becoming such a major star that he was later dubbed the King of Pop. Youngest daughter Janet also became a hugely successful recording artist. \n \n The elder Jackson managed daughters Rebbie, La Toya and Janet in the early 1980s until they, like their brothers before, struck out on their own. \n \n Joe Jackson was criticized at times for being a harsh taskmaster. His children told stories about their father being hard on them growing up. \n \n In 2013 interview with CNN, Jackson was asked about Janet's complaint that the children were not allowed to call him \"Dad,\" instead referring to him as \"Joe.\" \n \n \"You had all those kids running hollering around,\" Jackson said. \"They're hollering, 'Dad, Dad, Dad,' you know, and it gets to be -- it sounds kind of funny to me. But I didn't care too much about what they called me, just as long as they (were) able to listen to me and what I had to tell them, you know, in order to make their lives successful. This was the main thing.\" \n \n Jackson admitted that he disciplined his children physically, but said he had no regrets. \n \n \"I'm glad I was tough, because look what I came out with,\" he said. \"I came out with some kids that everybody loved all over the world. And they treated everybody right.\" \n \n Jackson also weathered some controversy after his wife documented his alleged extramarital affairs in her book, \"My Family, The Jacksons.\" \n \n The couple split more than once and lived apart for decades, but they reportedly never divorced. \n \n The couple presented a united front when Michael died in 2009 from an overdose of propofol. \n \n The elder Jackson told CNN his son had tried to reach him before his death, but they didn't connect. \n \n \"He says, 'Call my father.' This was before he passed. 'He would know how to get me out of this,'\" Joe Jackson said. \"But they didn't get in touch with me. They said they couldn't find me, but I was right there.\" \n \n Just this past weekend, Janet Jackson hailed her father during an acceptance speech at a Radio Disney awards ceremony. \n \n \"My mother nourished me with the most extravagant love imaginable,\" she said. \"My father, my incredible father drove me to be the best I can. My siblings set an incredibly high standard, a high bar for artistic excellence.\" ||||| Story highlights Joe Jackson said he was strict because he wanted the best for his family \n \n \"This was Gary, Indiana, and I had to make sure that they didn't get in any type of trouble\" \n \n Jackson tells CNN's Piers Morgan he heard about Michael Jackson's death from a fan \n \n On his son's jailed doctor: \"I blame a lot of people, not just Conrad Murray\" \n \n The stories have been around for decades -- sometimes disquieting ones about the strict upbringing of Joe and Katherine Jackson's nine children in a high-pressure, showbiz family. \n \n Joe Jackson addressed those stories and his family's past in an interview with \"Piers Morgan Tonight\" that aired Wednesday night, saying that yes, he did physically discipline his children. \n \n Why did he do it? \n \n \"I had to be like that way because during those times, it was hard, and you have a lot of gangs there, you know, in the area where we were living,\" Jackson told Piers Morgan. \"This was Gary, Indiana, and I had to make sure that they didn't get in any type of trouble, and things of that sort.\" \n \n Does he have any regrets about his approach to parenting? \n \n Photos: Michael Jackson: King of Pop Photos: Michael Jackson: King of Pop Michael Jackson died of cardiac arrest at age 50 on June 25, 2009, sending shockwaves around the world.

The hospice is connected to a hospital where Joe was admitted. We're told he was moved to the hospice a day and a half ago. \n \n Joe Jackson \ufeff-- the patriarch of the Jackson family -- has died ... TMZ has learned. \n \n Family sources tell TMZ, Joe passed away at 3:30 AM Wednesday. \n \n We broke the story ... Joe was hospitalized in June with terminal cancer. His family had been flocking to his bedside since. His wife, Katherine, had been at his bedside as were some of Joe's children and grandchildren. \n \n Joe had been battling health problems for some time now. He was hospitalized back in 2016 after coming down with a high fever. But, he bounced back not long after and was seen partying in Vegas. His health was also fragile after a stroke and 3 heart attacks back in 2015. Doctors implanted a pacemaker. \n \n Joe may have been the most successful parent managing his children in the history of music. He, with a little help from Diana Ross, engineered the careers of The Jackson 5, and then Michael and Janet Jackson as solo artists. \n \n The elder Jackson took a lot of heat from Michael and his siblings for abusing parenting and management practices, including physical brutality. Joe copped to it but, far from apologizing ... he said his methods made his kids successful and kept them out of jail. \n \n Michael's dad stood by him during his molestation trial. After Michael's death, Joe was criticized for trying to make money off his son's memory. \n \n A rep for Michael's estate tells us, \"We are deeply saddened by Mr. Jackson\u2019s passing and extend our heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Katherine Jackson and the family. Joe was a strong man who acknowledged his own imperfections and heroically delivered his sons and daughters from the steel mills of Gary, Indiana to worldwide pop superstardom.\" \n \n Joe had 10 kids with Katherine, his wife of more than 60 years. The 2 did not live together and had a strained relationship for the last years of his life, but they frequently interacted. \n \n Joe was 89.",

Jackson later guided the careers of Michael and sister Janet Jackson when they embarked on solo careers. Over the years, Jackson had a rocky relationship with his wife, Katherine, with whom he had 10 children, according to CNN. They separated several times but never divorced. Katherine described his alleged extramarital affairs in the book My Family, The Jacksons. Jackson was also roundly criticized by his children and others for allegedly abusive parenting, which included physical punishment. He acknowledged that he was a strict disciplinarian but was unapologetic about his behavior. \"I'm glad I was tough because look what I came out with,\" he told CNN in 2013. \"I came out with some kids that everybody loved all over the world.

    "document": "(CNN) For decades, mystery has swirled around what happened to the founding population of the remote Easter Island, known for its towering stone statues depicting large carved heads. A long-held theory suggests that after the islanders set up camp and carved the giant statues, they destroyed their own society through infighting and a depletion of natural resources. \n \n But a new study suggests a different scenario entirely, and the islanders could have a more complex history than previously believed. \n \n Many aspects of the island, the statues and the Polynesian seafarers who arrived there 900 years ago have been studied over the years. But a study published Monday in the Journal of Pacific Archaeology uses multiple data sets from recent excavations to provide a better understanding of the society that created the statues and how they were carved. \n \n So the researchers used an unlikely method to study the society and discern what might have happened: a chemical analysis of stone tools used on the statues. \n \n What they learned from excavating four of the statues and the volcanic stone basalt tools used to carve them painted a different picture: a sophisticated and collaborative society. \n \n \"The idea of competition and collapse on Easter Island might be overstated,\" said lead study author Dale Simpson Jr., an archaeologist at the University of Queensland, in a statement. \"To me, the stone carving industry is solid evidence that there was cooperation among families and craft groups.\" \n \n Moai are spread across the landscape of Easter Island. \n \n A complex society \n \n Easter Island is 2,300 miles off the coast of Chile. About 900 years ago, the founding population landed on the island, called Rapa Nui in the local language. These Polynesian seafarers came on two canoes and were led by Hotu Matu'a, who would become the island's first chief, according to oral tradition. \n \n The population soared to include thousands of people, and they carved full-body figures, called moai, to represent important Rapa Nui ancestors. There are nearly a thousand statues, many buried up to their heads due to the passage of time. The largest statue is over 70 feet tall. \n \n Their sheer size and number is indicative of a complex, sophisticated society, according to the researchers. \n \n \"Ancient Rapa Nui had chiefs, priests, and guilds of workers who fished, farmed, and made the moai. There was a certain level of sociopolitical organization that was needed to carve almost a thousand statues,\" Simpson said. \n \n During the statue excavations, Jo Anne Van Tilburg, director of the Easter Island Statue Project, and her Rapa Nui excavation team recovered about 1,600 stone tools. They did a close chemical and mass spectrometer analysis of fragments from 17 of the tools, called toki. \n \n \"We wanted to figure out where the raw materials used to manufacture the artifacts came from,\" said Laure Dussubieux, a study co-author and Field Museum scientist, in a statement. \"We wanted to know if people were taking material from close to where they lived.\" \n \n The location is key because there are three sources, or quarries, where the islanders could have gathered material for tools. The basalt quarries cover the size of two football fields. Basalt samples reveal their sources through their chemical elements, which link back to the geology of the site. \n \n \"The majority of the toki came from one quarry complex -- once the people found the quarry they liked, they stayed with it,\" Simpson said. \"For everyone to be using one type of stone, I believe they had to collaborate. That's why they were so successful -- they were working together.\" \n \n Looking ahead \n \n This contrasts with the idea that the residents ran out of resources and fought amongst themselves, the researchers said. But later on, it is believed that the arrival of colonists and the institution of slavery decimated the population. \n \n \"There's so much mystery around Easter Island, because it's so isolated, but on the island, people were, and still are, interacting in huge amounts,\" Simpson said. \"There are thousands of Rapa Nui people alive today -- the society isn't gone.\" \n \n But the researchers also urge caution and believe that this study is just the beginning, laying the groundwork for more research. \n \n \"The near exclusive use of one quarry to produce these seventeen tools supports a view of craft specialization based on information exchange, but we can't know at this stage if the interaction was collaborative,\" Van Tilburg said. \"It may also have been coercive in some way. Human behavior is complex. This study encourages further mapping and stone sourcing, and our excavations continue to shed new light on moai carving.\" ||||| You probably know Easter Island as \"the place with the giant stone heads.\" This remote island 2,300 miles off the coast of Chile has long been seen as mysterious--a place where Polynesian seafarers set up camp, built giant statues, and then destroyed their own society through in-fighting and over-exploitation of natural resources. However, a new article in the Journal of Pacific Archaeology hints at a more complex story--by analyzing the chemical makeup of the tools used to create the big stone sculptures, archaeologists found evidence of a sophisticated society where the people shared information and collaborated. \n \n \"For a long time, people wondered about the culture behind these very important statues,\" says Field Museum scientist Laure Dussubieux, one of the study's authors. \"This study shows how people were interacting, it's helping to revise the theory.\" \n \n \"The idea of competition and collapse on Easter Island might be overstated,\" says lead author Dale Simpson, Jr., an archaeologist from the University of Queensland. \"To me, the stone carving industry is solid evidence that there was cooperation among families and craft groups.\" \n \n The first people arrived on Easter Island (or, in the local language, Rapa Nui) about 900 years ago. \"The founding population, according to oral tradition, was two canoes led by the island's first chief, Hotu Matu?a,\" says Simpson, who is currently on the faculty of the College of DuPage. Over the years, the population rose to the thousands, forming the complex society that carved the statues Easter Island is known for today. These statues, or moai, often referred to as \"Easter Island heads,\" are actually full-body figures that became partially buried over time. The moai, which represent important Rapa Nui ancestors, number nearly a thousand, and the largest one is over seventy feet tall. \n \n According to Simpson, the size and number of the moai hint at a complex society. \"Ancient Rapa Nui had chiefs, priests, and guilds of workers who fished, farmed, and made the moai. There was a certain level of sociopolitical organization that was needed to carve almost a thousand statues,\" says Simpson. \n \n Recent excavations of four statues in the inner region of Rano Raraku, the statue quarry, were conducted by Jo Anne Van Tilburg of Cotsen Institute of Archaeology, UCLA and director of the Easter Island Statue Project, along with her Rapa Nui excavation team. To better understand the society that fabricated two of the statues, Simpson, Dussubieux, and Van Tilburg took a detailed look at twenty one of about 1,600 stone tools made of volcanic stone called basalt that had been recovered in Van Tilburg's excavations. About half of the tools, called toki, recovered were fragments that suggested how they were used. \n \n For Van Tilburg, the goal of the project was to gain a better understanding of how tool makers and statue carvers may have interacted, thus gaining insight into how the statue production industry functioned. \"We wanted to figure out where the raw materials used to manufacture the artifacts came from,\" explained Dussubieux. \"We wanted to know if people were taking material from close to where they lived.\" \n \n There are at least three different sources on Easter Island that the Rapa Nui used for material to make their stone tools. The basalt quarries cover twelve thousand square meters, an area the size of two football fields. And those different quarries, the tools that came from them, and the movement between geological locations and archaeological sites shed light on prehistoric Rapa Nui society. \n \n \"Basalt is a grayish rock that doesn't look like anything special, but when you look at the chemical composition of the basalt samples from different sources, you can see very subtle differences in concentrations of different elements,\" explains Dussubieux. \"Rock from each source is different because of the geology of each site.\" \n \n Dussubieux led the chemical analysis of the stone tools. The archaeologists used a laser to cut off tiny pieces of stone from the toki and then used an instrument called a mass spectrometer to analyze the amounts of different chemical elements present in the samples. The results pointed to a society that Simpson believes involved a fair amount of collaboration. \n \n \"The majority of the toki came from one quarry complex--once the people found the quarry they liked, they stayed with it,\" says Simpson. \"For everyone to be using one type of stone, I believe they had to collaborate. That's why they were so successful--they were working together.\" \n \n To Simpson, this level of large-scale cooperation contradicts the popular narrative that Easter Island's inhabitants ran out of resources and warred themselves into extinction. \"There's so much mystery around Easter Island, because it's so isolated, but on the island, people were, and still are, interacting in huge amounts,\" says Simpson. While the society was later decimated by colonists and slavery, Rapa Nui culture has persisted. \"There are thousands of Rapa Nui people alive today--the society isn't gone,\" Simpson explains. \n \n Van Tilburg urges caution in interpreting the study's results. \"The near exclusive use of one quarry to produce these seventeen tools supports a view of craft specialization based on information exchange, but we can't know at this stage if the interaction was collaborative. It may also have been coercive in some way. Human behavior is complex. This study encourages further mapping and stone sourcing, and our excavations continue to shed new light on moai carving.\" In addition to potentially paving the way for a more nuanced view of the Rapa Nui people, Dussubieux notes that the study is important because of its wider-reaching insights into how societies work. \"What happens in this world is a cycle, what happened in the past will happen again,\" says Dussubieux. \"Most people don't live on a small island, but what we learn about people's interactions in the past is very important for us now because what shapes our world is how we interact.\" \n \n ###",

was always more going on there - a look, an expression, a sentiment - that hint at what is to come... the shadow that he casts in these films is a huge one and the emotion he conveys is immeasurable.\u201d \n \n On numerous occasions, Rickman had to hide his knowledge from journalists asking difficult questions about the Harry Potter story. In an interview with RTE, he hinted at a \u201clittle piece of information, which I always said I would never share with anybody and never have, and never will.\u201d \n \n \"Certainly, I did say I needed to talk to her before I could get a handle on how to play it, and we did have a phone conversation,\" he said. \"She certainly didn't tell me what the end of the story was going to be in any way at all, so I was having to buy the books along with everybody else to find out, 'And now what?' \n \n \"No, she gave me one little piece of information, which I always said I would never share with anybody and never have, and never will. It wasn't a plot point, or crucial in any tangible way, but it was crucial to me as a piece of information that made me travel down that road rather than that one or that one or that one.\u201d \n \n Rickman passed away at the age of 69 after suffering with cancer. ||||| Fans of Harry Potter (i.e. people who breathe) no doubt had a love-hate relationship with Hogwarts' complicated potions master Professor Snape. Alan Rickman's brilliant portrayal in the films brilliantly captured Snape as he is in the books -- the total best and the total worst. \n \n While Snape's backstory in the movies is told in disjointed order in flashbacks and revelations, a YouTube user uploaded this video of all of Snape's most important moments into one heartbreaking 14-minute gut check to your emotions. You have to watch all of it. \n \n All the big moments are in there, from Snape's feelings for Harry's mother Lily, to the moment (do we still have to say spoilers? Well, SPOILERS) he kills Dumbledore. \n \n Severus isn't the only person in Harry Potter who's hard to pin down. Tom Felton, who plays the awful, awful Draco Malfoy is a really nice dude in real life who wouldn't in a million years be sorted into the Slytherin House!",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 When Alan Rickman started playing Professor Severus Snape, the end of the Harry Potter series was not yet written\u2014but JK Rowling already had Snape's story arc figured out, and she hinted to Rickman that (spoiler alert!) there was more to Snape than met the eye so that he'd understand the character's motivation and know how to play him. Rickman had hinted at that fact in interviews, Mashable reports, but he never revealed exactly what Rowling told him\u2014but now Rowling finally has, thanks to a fan on Twitter who asked her, \"Will you tell us the piece of information that you told Alan Rickman about Severus Snape? Or will that forever be a secret?\" As the Independent explains, Rickman once said that Rowling didn't reveal the entire ending of the series to him, but rather gave him \"one little piece of information, which I always said I would never share with anybody and never have, and never will,\" and that helped him \"travel down that road rather than that one or that one or that one.\" Rowling's response to the aforementioned fan explains what that \"one little piece\" was: \"I told Alan what lies behind the word 'always,'\" she wrote. Spoiler alert part 2: She's referring to the fact that, as Snape reveals to Dumbledore toward the end of the series, he's \"always\" loved Harry's mother, and thus felt compelled to protect Harry.

But I looked up and I saw that my dad was closing his eyes, the water was getting in his eyes. And I just thought: He has absolutely no idea where we are going to go.\u201d \n \n For a vast swath of southeast Texas, there may be more trouble in the days ahead. The National Weather Service said the storm was expected to linger for a number of days. It predicted an additional 15 to 25 inches of rainfall along the upper Texas coast and southwest Louisiana through Friday. The service also raised the possibility of 50 inches of total rainfall in some areas, exceeding previous Texas records. \n \n Flooding was reported in numerous communities in the Texas interior between Houston, to the east, and Austin and San Antonio, to the west. On Sunday, a mandatory evacuation order was issued for the city of La Grange, where the National Weather Service projected that the Colorado River would crest at 49.1 feet, according to the city\u2019s website. \n \n As inland communities struggled with the flooding crisis, coastal communities that took the brunt of the hurricane\u2019s pounding remained punch-drunk. ||||| (CNN) Even as darkness fell and the waters kept rising, emergency officials in Houston continued fielding calls overnight from flood-stranded Texans. Thousands have been rescued so far, many are still waiting to picked up. \n \n \"The Coast Guard is continuing to receive upwards of 1,000 calls per hour,\" US Coast Guard Lt. Mike Hart said Monday. \"Today alone, the Coast Guard has rescued over 3,000 people. That includes both air rescues and rescues using boats.\" \n \n Since midnight Sunday, more than 2,300 calls have poured in to the Houston Fire Department, including 400 calls for rescue Monday afternoon, Houston officials said. Four people have died as a result of the catastrophic storm. \n \n Houston police had rescued 1,000 people since Monday morning, bringing the total number rescued to more than 3,000 since the storm flooded the city, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner told reporters Monday night. \n \n Live video from Houston showed rescuers in small boats on one flooded street carrying people to higher ground. \n \n 'They're panicking' \n \n As Harvey dumped rain on East Texas and the waters rose, people started to panic, rushing rescue boats and even shooting at them if they didn't stop, said one volunteer rescuer. \n \n Clyde Cain, of the Cajun Navy, a Louisiana-based rescue force that gained fame during Hurricane Katrina, said in one instance, a boat broke down, and while the crew sought shelter in a delivery truck, people tried to steal the inoperable boat. \n \n \"They're making it difficult for us to rescue them,\" he said. \"You have people rushing the boat. Everyone wants to get in at the same time. They're panicking. Water is rising.\" \n \n Because of the hostile responses, the Cajun Navy has been forced to halt some rescue attempts, Cain said. \n \n \"We have boats being shot at if we're not picking everybody up. We're having to pull out for a minute. We're dropping an airboat right now to go rescue a couple of our boats that broke, and they're kind of under attack,\" he said. \n \n There is no indication the water will stop rising anytime soon. Swollen rivers in east Texas aren't expected to crest until later this week, and federal officials are already predicting the deadly Tropical Storm Harvey will drive 30,000 people into shelters and spur 450,000 victims to seek some sort of disaster assistance. \n \n And yet, forecasters say, more rain is coming. Lots more. \n \n President pledges 'rapid action from Congress' \n \n President Trump said Monday the recovery from Hurricane Harvey will be \"a long and difficult road,\" but predicted the country would emerge \"bigger, better, stronger than ever before.\" Trump is scheduled to visit Texas on Tuesday. \n \n Calling the storm a catastrophe in Southeast Texas, the President said, \"We see neighbor helping neighbor, friend helping friend and stranger helping stranger. We are one American family. We hurt together, we struggle together and believe me, we endure together.\" \n \n The President also said he believes Congress will act fast to provide disaster relief funding to the areas affected by Harvey. \n \n \"You're going to see very rapid action from Congress -- certainly from the President,\" Trump said. \n \n Addressing Texans, he added: \"We're going to get your funding.\" \n \n Latest developments \n \n -- About 8,000 people were estimated to be in Houston shelters Monday night, said Houston's mayor. About 5,000 were expected to be in the Houston Convention Center, he said. \n \n -- The Galveston County Office of Emergency Management on Monday issued a mandatory evacuation order for Dickinson, Texas, according to spokeswoman Brittany Viegas. Dickinson is about 172 miles northeast of coastal Rockport. A dramatic photo circulating on the Internet showed residents of an assisted living facility in Dickinson being rescued on Sunday. \n \n -- There have been four confirmed storm-related deaths, according to officials. Five other Harris County fatalities are suspected of being storm-related, according to Tricia Bentley, spokeswoman for the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences. The manners of death will be confirmed this week, she said. \n \n -- The average annual rainfall in Houston is 50 inches. The city has seen 25 inches of rain in two days. Another 25 could fall by Saturday. \n \n -- Several cities, including Katy, Alvin, Friendswood, League City, Pasadena, Pearland, Seabrook and Webster, have instituted curfews. \n \n -- The Houston Independent School District has canceled school for the week for the district's 215,000 students. \n \n -- Dallas is opening a \"mega-shelter\" at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center, but Mayor Mike Rawlings said, \"We may have thousands upon thousands upon thousands of more individuals that will get bigger than this convention center.\" \n \n -- President Trump approved Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards ' request for an emergency declaration. The governor said in his request that he believes Beauregard, Calcasieu, Cameron, Jefferson Davis and Vermilion parishes will face the brunt of Harvey's winds and rain. The President said he will also visit Louisiana on Saturday. \n \n -- Energy provider CenterPoint says 96% of its Houston customers have power, but more than 104,000 are without electricity as crews experience difficulty reaching affected areas. \n \n -- The NFL said the Houston Texans' preseason game against the Dallas Cowboys, scheduled for Thursday in Houston, has been moved to the Cowboys' home stadium in Arlington, Texas. The MLB's Astros and the University of Houston and University of Texas football teams -- as well as Louisiana State University, which has a game scheduled Saturday in Houston -- all have practices or games this week and were monitoring the storm before deciding if they will play. \n \n After checking the rain gauge, a new daily rainfall record was set at the NWS Office of 16.08\" beating yesterday's record of 14.40\" #houwx \u2014 NWS Houston (@NWSHouston) August 28, 2017 \n \n 'Landmark event' \n \n Several locales have received 2 feet or more of rain, and forecasters say a reprieve won't arrive until week's end at the earliest. By then, rain totals could reach another 2 feet -- with isolated instances of 40 to 50 more inches -- along the upper Texas coast. \n \n \"This is a landmark event for Texas,\" FEMA Administrator Brock Long said. \"Texas has never seen an event like this.\" \n \n Long said earlier that FEMA will likely be in Texas for years, and that Harvey will require one of the largest recovery housing efforts the nation has ever seen. \n \n Harvey will likely surpass 2008's Hurricane Ike and 2001's Tropical Storm Allison, two of the most destructive storms to hit the Gulf Coast in recent memory, he said. Millions of people from Corpus Christi to New Orleans were under flood watches and warnings Monday as Harvey's storm bands repeatedly pummeled the same areas. \n \n #Harvey is expected to retreat back to the Gulf of Mexico before heading back toward #Houston Wednesday. #txwx #TropicalStormHarvey pic.twitter.com/32RoWCover \u2014 CNN Weather Center (@CNNweather) August 27, 2017 \n \n For state and federal officials working to mitigate Harvey's devastation, one of the more frustrating aspects of the storm is uncertainty. \n \n \"The word catastrophic does not appropriately describe what we're facing,\" said US Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas. \"We just don't know when it's going to end.\" \n \n Early Monday, Harvey was barely clinging to tropical storm status, but the danger is far from over. The storm is forecast to head southeast toward the Matagorda Bay and Gulf of Mexico, where it will pick up additional moisture before sliding back over Galveston and Houston, cities it has already hammered. \n \n The slow-moving nature of the storm -- it has traveled about 3 mph, human walking speed, since Friday's landfall -- has fueled the rain and flooding. Houston's William P. Hobby Airport recorded more than a foot of rain Saturday and 11 inches of rain Sunday, the two wettest days recorded since 1930. \n \n Even when the rain is gone, dangers will persist, said National Weather Service Director Louis Uccellini, because \"the flooding will be very slow to recede.\" \n \n Finding a 'new normal' \n \n JUST WATCHED Reporter: We almost left, but heard your voice Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Reporter: We almost left, but heard your voice 05:28 \n \n Citizens with boats assisted authorities in search and rescue efforts on Sunday, and at a Monday news conference, Long encouraged more citizens to come forward, saying the recovery efforts would require community involvement. He said the National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster website would direct folks to religious and nongovernmental agencies through which residents can help victims, who, so far, span 30 to 50 counties. \n \n \"Donate your money. Figure out how you can get involved as we help Texas find a new normal.\" said Long, who was scheduled to arrive Monday in Corpus Christi. \n \n One citizen answering the call is Jim McIngvale, who owns furniture stores in Houston and Richmond. He opened his doors to evacuees on Sunday and provided 600 people a place to sleep. \n \n \"We have tons of mattresses in our warehouse and we can provide them with a blanket,\" he told CNN. \"We have a restaurant inside the stores, and we are and we are feeding them for free.\" \n \n Aaron Mitchell of Aransas Pass, appeared shell-shocked as he recounted riding out the storm in his mobile home, which he said \"felt like 'The Wizard of Oz,' man.\" He had walked 12 miles to find his father in Rockport, to no avail. \n \n Though he has no intention of leaving the place he calls home, he second-guessed his decision not to evacuate, he said. \n \n \"I just lost everything I worked for. Everything,\" he said. \"I don't know. Maybe I should've left.\" \n \n (After his interview, Mitchell reached his father via telephone and, in tears, told him, \"OK, Dad, I'm going to jump on a bus. I'll be there.\") \n \n Houston resident Louise Walker also chose to brave Harvey's wrath, leaving her trapped in a neighbor's apartment. \n \n \"Our bottom level is waist-deep in water,\" she said. \"We have people who are living in these first-floor apartments, like I have. They have been breaking into empty second-level apartments just to have somewhere to go,\" she said. \n \n State, local and military rescue units have plucked thousands of stranded residents from the water and deluged homes. \"None of us (is) going to give up,\" Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said, reassuring residents. \n \n In Harris County, authorities asked stranded people to hang sheets or towels from their residences, so rescuers could spot them more easily. \n \n IMPORTANT: If you are awaiting rescue, hang a towel or sheet prominently so we can find you. Adresses are hard to spot. #harvey #hounews \u2014 HCSOTexas (@HCSOTexas) August 28, 2017 \n \n The Pentagon is also identifying resources, including trucks, aircraft and troops, that can be dispatched for hurricane relief if the request comes, defense officials said, and Gov. Greg Abbott has activated the entire Texas National Guard, roughly 12,000 Guardsmen, he said Monday. \n \n Dam releases \n \n JUST WATCHED Harvey brings 'life-threatening' flooding Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Harvey brings 'life-threatening' flooding 02:22 \n \n The US Army Corps of Engineers began releasing water from the Addicks and Barker dams in west Houston early Monday, said Jeff Linder, Harris County flood control district meteorologist. \n \n \"The rationale is it is better to start with controlled releases using the outlet structures than to allow uncontrolled release to go over the edge of the dam. So we have more capability to control the downstream effects,\" said Edmond Russo with the US Army Corps of Engineers. \n \n In Conroe, an hour's drive north of Houston, record levels of water are also being released from Lake Conroe Dam. The city will be evacuating some neighborhoods as a result. \n \n Residents living along the Brazos River in Fort Bend County were ordered to evacuate after the National Weather Service predicted river levels of 56.1 feet, nearly 2 feet above the record during flooding last year. \n \n Tyler County, north of Beaumont, also issued a mandatory evacuation order for all \"low-lying and flood-prone areas.\" \n \n A mandatory evacuation has been ordered for people in low lying flood prone areas of Tyler County. #TX36 pic.twitter.com/xUTuVjhRX6 \u2014 Brian Babin (@RepBrianBabin) August 28, 2017 \n \n South of Houston, in Brazoria County, officials set up an evacuation route for at-risk residents, ordering them to \"LEAVE NOW!\" Those in need of shelter can take refuge in the Bell County Expo Center in Belton, officials said. \n \n The state of roads -- particularly interstates 10, 45 and 610 in Houston -- left many residents stranded.

White House homeland security adviser Tom Bossert told reporters on Thursday aid funding requests would come in stages as more became known about the impact of the storm. \n \n Texas Governor Greg Abbott has said that his state may need more than $125 billion. \n \n Bossert said the Trump administration wanted Congress to pass the disaster relief measure on its own and not add it to other measures, such as the effort to raise the debt ceiling. \n \n The U.S. government has a statutory limit on how much money it can borrow to cover the budget deficit that results from Washington spending more than it collects in taxes. Only Congress can raise that limit. \n \n Trump plans a second visit to the region on Saturday. \n \n Though the sun was out in Houston on Friday and water levels down in many areas, Mayor Sylvester Turner called for voluntary evacuations on the city\u2019s west side. He said already-flooded neighborhoods there may be in greater danger as the Army Corps of Engineers continues to release water into the adjacent Buffalo Bayou to prevent dam and levee failures. \n \n About 80 miles (130 km) to the east, the Neches River, which flows into Beaumont and nearby Port Arthur, was forecast to crest early on Saturday well above flood levels, the National Weather Service said. \n \n \u201cIt (the Neches River) is about 7 feet (2.1 meters) above the record and it will continue to remain at or be near that high for about the next week. This flooding poses an ongoing threat,\u201d Texas Governor Abbott told reporters. \n \n Rescue officials were still working to determine the scope of flooding, said Rodney Smith, deputy chief of the Cedar Hill, Texas, Fire Department. \n \n The storm\u2019s impact played out in ways large and small, a full week after Hurricane Harvey slammed into the Texas coast Friday night as the strongest hurricane to hit the state in more than 50 years. \n \n At the Hollywood Community Cemetery in Orange, floodwaters had caused three coffins to pop out of concrete vaults. One belonged to Dewey Mosby, who died in 2003 at the age of 82. \n \n \u201cHe won\u2019t stay put,\u201d said Ron Kendall, 63, who helps maintain the cemetery and said he knew Mosby well in life. Kendall had helped direct Mosby\u2019s coffin back to its resting place after the 2008 floods from Hurricane Ike and again during floods in 2016. \n \n \u201cEverybody knows where Mr. Mosby goes now because he always comes up,\u201d Kendall said. \n \n Nancy McBride is carried out of her flooded home by volunteer Cody Collinsworth, after returning home for the first time since Harvey floodwaters arrived in Houston, Texas September 1, 2017. REUTERS/Rick Wilking \n \n BURNING CHEMICALS \n \n At chemical maker Arkema SA, a fire started on Thursday in a truck storing chemicals at a flooded plant east of Houston had burned itself out by Friday. But more blasts were likely in eight other trucks storing the same chemicals.. \n \n Meanwhile a new storm, Irma, had strengthened on Friday into a Category 3 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. It remained hundreds of miles from land but was forecast to possibly hit Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic and Haiti by the middle of next week. \n \n Harvey, which lingered around the Gulf of Mexico Coast for days, dumped unprecedented amounts of rain and left devastation across more than 300 miles (480 km) of the state\u2019s coast. \n \n A list of the dead put out by Harris County painted a grim picture of the storm\u2019s brutality, describing bodies found floating face down in floodwaters, lying in ditches or across fences. Many were unidentified. \n \n The storm shut about a fourth of U.S. refinery capacity, much of which is clustered along the Gulf Coast, and caused gasoline prices to spike to a two-year high ahead of the long Labor Day holiday weekend. \n \n The national average for a gallon of regular gasoline has risen 17 cents since the storm struck, hitting $2.519 as of Friday morning, according to motorists group AAA. \n \n Supply concerns prompted the U.S. Energy Department to authorize the release of up to 4.5 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \n \n Several East Coast refineries have run out of gasoline, raising fears that travelers will face fuel shortages during the three-day holiday. \n \n In Texas cities including Dallas, there were long lines at gas stations. Abbott said the state was taking steps to ensure adequate supplies, adding: \u201cDon\u2019t worry.

Rescuers answered hundreds of calls for help Sunday as floodwaters from the remnants of Hurricane Harvey rose high enough to... (Associated Press) \n \n HOUSTON (AP) \u2014 The Latest on Tropical Storm Harvey (all times local): \n \n 4:25 a.m. \n \n Harvey continues to head back toward the Gulf of Mexico at a slow pace. \n \n The National Hurricane Center says in its 4 a.m. CDT update that the tropical storm which made landfall late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane and has lingered dropping heavy rain in the Houston area still has sustained winds of up to 40 mph (65 kmh) and is centered 20 miles east of Victoria, Texas, about 120 miles (193 km) southwest of Houston. It continues to creep to the southeast at 3 mph (6 kmh). \n \n That means it remains virtually stalled near the coast and continues to drop heavy rain on the Houston and Galveston areas. In the past 48 hours, numerous spots in the region have measured more than 25 inches of rainfall. \n \n The hurricane center says Harvey's center was expected to drift off the middle Texas coast on Monday and meander offshore through Tuesday before beginning \"a slow northeastward motion.\" The center says those in the upper Texas coast and in southwestern Louisiana should continue to monitor Harvey's progress. \n \n ___ \n \n 3:38 a.m. \n \n Houston officials continue to urge people to shelter in place and stay off flooded roadways as Harvey continues to batter the nation's fourth-largest city. \n \n Public Information Officer Keith Smith also says Sunday that rescue efforts continue and now are focused on those who feel trapped inside a home or building. \n \n Smith says the city's 911 emergency response system has been challenged by sharply increased call volumes since the tropical storm made landfall late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane. He says during a typical 24-hour period, the emergency response system receives about 8,000 calls. But during a 17-hour period following Harvey's landfall, more than 56,000 911 calls were received. \n \n ___ \n \n 2:11 a.m. \n \n As the nation's fourth-largest city braced for more rain and rescues, officials started releasing even more water from reservoirs overwhelmed by Harvey even though the move aimed at protecting downtown Houston could make already devastating flooding worse around thousands of homes. \n \n The strategic engineering move began early Monday. Harvey, which made landfall late Friday as a Category 4 hurricane and has lingered dropping heavy rain as a tropical storm, sent devastating floods pouring into Houston Sunday as rising water chased thousands of people to rooftops or higher ground and overwhelmed rescuers who could not keep up with the constant calls for help. \n \n Jeff Lindner, a meteorologist for the Harris County Flood Control District, says residents affected by the release should pack what's needed and leave when the sun comes up. ||||| Massive flooding caused by Tropical Storm Harvey along Texas' refinery-rich coast could have long-standing and far-reaching consequences for the state's oil and gas industry and the larger U.S. economy. The storm's remnants left much of Houston underwater on Sunday, and the National Weather Service says it's not over yet: Some parts of Houston and its suburbs could end up with as much as 50 inches (1.3 meters) of rain. \n \n With the heavy precipitation expected to last for days, it's still unclear how bad the damage will be, but there is already evidence of widespread losses. Key oil and gas facilities along the Texas Gulf Coast have temporarily shut down, and flooding in the Houston and Beaumont areas could seriously pinch gasoline supplies. Companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico have evacuated drilling platforms and rigs, crimping the flow of oil and gas. \n \n Experts believe gasoline prices could increase as much as 25 cents a gallon. \n \n Harvey's toll on air travel in the U.S. is set to extend into Monday, with the tracking service FlightAware.com reporting that more than 1,400 flights already have been canceled. That's in addition to more than 2,000 canceled over the weekend. \n \n Economy watchers were looking to oil futures markets Sunday night and stock trading in the U.S. Monday morning for further indications of fallout. \n \n Here's what was known as of Sunday night: \n \n REFINERIES \n \n Nearly a third of U.S. refining capacity sits in low-lying areas along the coast from Corpus Christi, Texas, to Lake Charles, Louisiana. Beyond the shutdown of refineries at risk of a direct strike from high winds, there's the threat of flooding and potential power outages for gasoline supplies. \n \n Refinery outages continued to spread Sunday, with about 2.2 million barrels per day of refining capacity down or being brought down, according to analysts at S&P Global. \n \n Valero Energy Corp., whose two big Corpus Christi refineries escaped damage, said it was working with federal and Texas agencies and its business partners to determine what infrastructure was needed to resume refinery operations. \n \n Even before Harvey hit, the prospect of supply disruptions sent gasoline futures to $1.74 a gallon, their highest level since April, before they retreated to around $1.67 by Friday afternoon. At the pump, experts see gasoline increasing 10 cents to 25 cents a gallon. \n \n Given the strictures faced by the refineries, \"This is the dominoes starting to fall,\" Patrick DeHaan, senior petroleum analyst for Gas Buddy, said Sunday. \"This is sort of slowly turning out to be the worst-case scenario.\" \n \n ___ \n \n OIL AND GAS \n \n Companies have evacuated workers from oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. The U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said Sunday that workers had been removed from 105 of the 737 manned platforms used to pump oil and gas from beneath the Gulf. \n \n The agency estimated that platforms accounting for about 22 percent of oil production and 26 percent of natural gas output in the Gulf had been shut down. \n \n \"After the storm has passed, facilities will be inspected,\" the agency said in a news release. \"Once all standard checks have been completed, production from undamaged facilities will be brought back on line immediately. Facilities sustaining damage may take longer to bring back on line.\" \n \n ___ \n \n SHIPPING \n \n The shipping industry also is expected to be disrupted by the worst hurricane to hit the Texas coast in more than 50 years. Shipping terminals along the Texas coast shut down as the storm approached. Port operations in Corpus Christi and Galveston closed, and the port of Houston said container terminals and general cargo facilities closed around midday Friday. \n \n Rates increased for carrying freight between the Gulf and the U.S. East Coast. \n \n ___ \n \n TRAVEL \n \n More than 1,400 flight cancellations are reported for Monday, according to FlightAware. \n \n Houston's two airports were closed to all flights except those connected to relief efforts. Houston Bush Intercontinental Airport was not expected to reopen Monday until noon at the earliest. Houston International Airport was scheduled to remain closed until Wednesday morning. \n \n Airlines were offering customers the chance to reschedule trips that would take them to Houston, San Antonio or Austin from Friday through the weekend. \n \n ___ \n \n UTILITIES \n \n Researchers at Texas A&M University estimated that the storm would knock out power for at least 1.25 million people in Texas. They said the hardest-hit areas will include Corpus Christi, which is on the coast, and San Antonio, which is about 140 miles (225 kilometers) inland. \n \n ___ \n \n INSURANCE \n \n A firm that does forecasts for insurance companies expects wind-damage claims in the low billions of dollars, and possibly reaching as high as $6 billion. \n \n Risk Management Solutions Inc. said storm surges and inland flooding could be an even bigger source of losses. If the firm is correct, that would put homeowners and the government-backed National Flood Insurance Program at risk. \n \n The flood program is run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which owes the Treasury about $23 billion in funds borrowed to cover the cost of past disasters, according to a recent report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. \n \n Homeowner policies offered by insurance companies typically don't cover flood damage, yet a relatively small percentage of homeowners have flood insurance through the federal program. \n \n Property data firm CoreLogic estimated that insured losses for home and commercial properties, as of Friday, would be $1 billion to $2 billion from wind and storm- surge damage. ||||| In downtown Houston the Buffalo Bayou resembled a raging river on Thursday night after days of rain from Hurricane Harvey. \n \n HOUSTON - While the water is receding in some parts of Harris County, that's not the case along the Buffalo Bayou. Underneath Interstate 45 in downtown Houston, it resembles a raging river. \n \n The bayou is above it's all-time peak of 61.2 feet and has hit 62.7 feet. \n \n Friday morning, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner issued voluntary evacuation orders for west Houston residents who already have water in their homes. \n \n Harris County Flood Control District says it will be like that for some time as water from the Addicks reservoir flushes into Buffalo Bayou. Officials estimate the situation could remain like this for up to two weeks as they drain Addicks. \n \n The water levels at the Addicks and Barker reservoirs have crested, meaning officials do not expect conditions there to worsen. \n \n The Army Corps of Engineers is still discharging water into the surrounding area, Harris County Flood Control District meteorologist Jeff Lindner said in a press conference on Thursday morning. \n \n RESOURCE: Evacuation list \n \n By Thursday evening, officials said Barker was 80 percent full and Addicks was about 100 percent full. \n \n Since both levels of the reservoir have peaked, Lindner expects no additional structure flooding. He also said conditions along the Buffalo Bayou are not expected to worsen, but they aren't expected to improve. The bayou held steady overnight, Lindner said. \n \n Lindner also addressed rumors regarding the dam at the reservoirs, stressing that there is no damage. He said the dam is operating exactly as designed. \n \n The watershed has accumulated 35 inches of rain since Harvey started. The Addicks reservoir continues to release 7,000 CFS while Barker sits at a rate of 6,300. Those discharge rates are expected to continue for the next few days, mostly affecting the Kingwood area. \n \n Lindner also elaborated on the mandatory evacuation that was established for residents within the Barker community overnight. Many residents were left confused and concerned if their homes would see more flooding. \n \n Officials say the mandatory evacuation was implemented to keep people from returning to their homes. \n \n Both reservoir outlet gates are open and releasing storm water into Buffalo Bayou. House flooding is occurring in adjacent neighborhoods, and roadways that run through the reservoirs are underwater. \n \n Some 3,000 homes near Addicks reservoir and 1,000 homes near Barker are inundated due to water release, Lindner said Wednesday morning. \n \n After an area of the levee eroded on Wednesday morning, officials enforced mandatory evacuations for residents in the Cyprus Creek/Inverness Forest subdivision. Officials said a breach is not likely, but possible. \n \n A portion of the levee eroded after water came over the top of the intake system. Several agencies worked on Wednesday to remedy the situation by bringing sand to the area. \n \n Addicks reservoir rose quicker than forecasted and threatened the storage capacity, Edmond Rosso with Army Corps Engineer explained. Barker's gates, on the other hand, were opened in a slower manner. \n \n While the rain has stopped from Harvey, water levels will continue to rise in neighborhoods near the Addicks and Barker reservoirs as water is released from both, Harris County Flood Control District meteorologist Jeff Lindner told KHOU Tuesday night. \n \n \u201cWe just don\u2019t know exactly how this is going to play out because its never happened before,\" Lindner said. \n \n \"There is a lot of complex hydrology taking place, there\u2019s buildings, there\u2019s neighborhoods, there\u2019s retention basins. Underground, roadways, so we\u2019re just going to have to see how it works. Once it gets down to Rumble Creek, it gets simpler, it goes into the creek, then into the (Buffalo) bayou.\u201d \n \n Early Tuesday morning Addicks flowed over the spillway. Officials had started to release water from both reservoirs early Monday in an effort to prevent uncontrolled releases at the spillways. However, officials warned that there was potential for uncontrolled releases at the Addicks spillway once the pool level reaches 108 feet. That level is 104 feet for Barker. These releases will continue until Sept. 20. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you have this amount of rain in this amount of time,\u201d Lindner said. \n \n Lindner wanted to emphasize that there was not a breach in the dam on the north end of Addicks, as some people believe. \"The integrity of the dams is in fine shape....there is no potential damage to the north end.\" \n \n Officials stated earlier in the week that the following subdivisions would be affected by the north end of Addicks: \n \n Twin lakes \n \n Eldridge Park \n \n Lakes on Eldrige \n \n Independence Farms \n \n Tanner Heights \n \n Heritage Business Park \n \n Neighborhood list at risk of flooding from Addicks and Barker was reviewed and DO NOT have changes.

Thousands of homes could be at risk, he said. \n \n Hours later, weather officials expected Cypress Creek near Interstate 45 to top the levee by Monday morning, impacting nearly 200 homes. \n \n Harris County Flood Control officials issued a voluntary evacuation advisory for residents of the Inverness Forest subdivision for all streets north of Whitestone Lane, including East and West Greenbrook Drive and Kenchester drive. \n \n In Conroe, the San Jacinto Water Authority released record amounts of water from the Lake Conroe Dam, prompting the city of Conroe to call for immediate evacuations from McDade Estates and other neighborhoods affected by the release of the water just before 2 a.m. Monday. \n \n RESERVOIR RELEASE: Addicks and Barker to flow into Buffalo Bayou \n \n Spring Creek, running along north Harris and south Montgomery counties, was in major flood stage Sunday evening and was expected to crest late Monday, putting residents of more than two dozen neighborhoods in The Woodlands and Spring areas on either side of I-45 at risk. \n \n Montgomery County officials asked residents in flood-prone areas near the creek to consider safely evacuating Sunday afternoon. \n \n In Rosenberg, residents of homes on Huntington Road near the Brazos River were ordered to evacuate due to fears that the bridge leading out of the community would fail. \n \n Fort Bend County Judge Robert Hebert issued a mandatory evacuation order for low-lying parts of the county near the Brazos River that were affected by the Memorial Day floods in 2016. The order applies to about 50,000 people. Additional voluntary evacuations in the county for residents who could be stuck in their homes for multiple days could bring the total number of evacuees from Fort Bend to 130,000, or about 20 percent of the county's total population. \n \n To find out if you are in the evacuation zones, look here. \n \n This story is developing.",

Add as an interest to stay up to date on the latest news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \n \n According to tracking and recovery company LoJack and the National Insurance Crime Bureau, an organization supported by insurance companies, the Honda Accord has topped the list of most popular with thieves for the last several years. \n \n LoJack recently released a list of the top 10 most stolen and recovered LoJack-equipped vehicle models in 2013, which was topped by the Honda Accord for the fifth year in a row. \n \n The National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) released a similar report last August analyzing stolen cars, insured or not, in 2012 through the National Crime Information Center, the country's central database for reported crimes. That report also indicated the Honda Accord was the most stolen car for the fifth year in a row. \n \n In NICB's list, the 1996 Accord was the most stolen make and model, with 8,637 thefts. \n \n Frank Scafidi, director of public affairs for the NICB, said the organization's list and that of LoJack were like comparing \"peaches and grapes,\" but he was not surprised at LoJack's stolen car rankings. \n \n Honda Accords \"are very popular cars.

Police say he died of a \"sudden illness,\" but his family say he was beaten to death. The villagers had planned to march through police barricades around the town to local government offices. Local authorities had urged them not to. Amid deadlock, deputy provincial Communist Party secretary Zhu Mingguo agreed to meet local leaders on Wednesday in the town of Lufeng. The BBC reports that a senior provincial official told him and another village representative in a meeting today that four villagers being held by police would be released over the next few days and land from one development project would be returned to the villagers.",

What did they shot flying over Texas? \n \n The images you can see in this post were taken in the afternoon of Mar. 10, 2014. Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett, along with other fellow photographers were at Amarillo International Airport when they saw the contrails of three high flying aircraft. \n \n Even though the aircraft were barely visible at distance, the photographers pointed their lenses at the unidentified planes, and took several shots. \n \n As Douglass recalls in his blog, it was only when they reviewed the images that they noticed that the aircraft were not B-2s as they initially thought: \u201cAt one point the aircraft had banked and the trailing edge was quite clear. It wasn\u2019t straight but had a slight curve, the aircraft was almost boomerang shaped.\u201d \n \n Indeed, an inquiry to Whiteman Air Force Base has ruled out the possibility that a flight of three B-2s was flying over Texas on Mar. 10. \n \n Stealth expert Bill Sweetman and the rest of the AW&ST team have investigated the mystery aircraft sighting, coming to the conclusion that the photos show something real. \n \n \n \n Even if its shape loosely resembles that of an X-47B, the mystery aircraft seems to be larger than Navy\u2019s new killer drone. \n \n Obviously someone will argue that exposing three Black Aircraft in plain daylight is not that smart, especially if you want to keep the project classified. \n \n Unless, you think the moment has arrived to show some potential resurgent enemy (Russia?) that you have an ace in the hole, as done some 30 years earlier with the F-117. \n \n Image credit: Steve Douglass and Dean Muskett \n \n Related articles ||||| It's difficult to determine, but a group of aviation enthusiasts say they caught a glimpse of a mystery aircraft earlier this month flying slowly across the Amarillo, Texas sky. \n \n \"We looked southwest and there they were,\" Steve Douglass, a journalist and member of the group, told FoxNews.com. \"We thought they were B-2s, but when we studied our pictures, we ruled that out.\" \n \n Douglass and his group, armed with cameras and binoculars, met on March 10 at the Rick Husband Amarillo International Airport. The airport is a perfect venue because it offers expansive views of Texas' big sky and a steady stream of military air traffic. On a good day, the group can see various military jets, and even the elusive F-22 Raptor. \n \n It was a clear day, and the group was alerted to three aircraft flying across the southwest skies. Douglass estimated that the planes got within 20 miles of the group and they started taking pictures with their 300mm zoom cameras. They looked at the photos, and saw that one appeared to be a silver-grey B-2 bomber. \n \n The prospects of spotting a B-2 bomber was exciting, and Douglass said he got home to observe his photos when he noticed the aircraft in his picture had a smooth backside. The B-2 bomber has a distinct \"W\"-shaped back. \n \n \"The trailing edge is wrong,\" Douglass shouted, according to his March 28 blog post. \n \n Few items provoke public interest like an unidentified flying object. These stories are often attached to other theories about hidden testing bases or alien life forms. But these images have prompted some interest in the industry. \n \n \"The photos tell us more about what the mysterious stranger isn't than what it is,\" Bill Sweetman writes in Aviation Week, which first reported on the story. The report said that Douglass picked up some apparently related voice signals, which would indicate the aircraft had a pilot. Editors at Aviation Week reportedly say the images appear to be \"something real.\" \n \n \"If I had to guess, I'd say we took a picture of a stealthy transport aircraft,\" Douglass said. \n \n Douglass writes that he reached out to Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, which houses B-2s, to see if it flew any planes over Texas on that day and did not get a response. \n \n Fox News' Edmund DeMarche contributed to this report",

Which leaves what, exactly? \"If I had to guess, I'd say we took a picture of a stealthy transport aircraft,\" said one of the enthusiasts, Steve Douglass. He blogs in greater detail, saying the US military may be trotting out new planes (probably piloted) to make its enemies shiver or go broke trying to replicate them. This last happened when the world took note of the Air Force's F-117, and \"the Soviet Union went bankrupt\" seeking \"ways to counter stealth,\" writes Douglass. \"Ask yourself an important question\u2014what's going on in the world right now?\" he asks. \"Who (has of late) has decided to roll back the clock to the good old days of the Cold War and MAD?\" Another analyst looks at \"gaps in the USAF's line-up\" for answers, noting that the Air Force has sought a \"penetrating, stand-in electronic attack\" for its strike systems; see that analysis at Aviation Week.",

(Associated Press) \n \n Girls walk along a street in Old Havana where a driver steers his classic American car in Havana, Cuba, Tuesday, April 17, 2018. A legislative session on Wednesday will see a historic political transition, in which President Raul Castro plans to step down and hand over the office to a younger successor.... (Associated Press) \n \n HAVANA (AP) \u2014 The Cuban government on Wednesday selected 57-year-old First Vice President Miguel Mario Diaz-Canel Bermudez as the sole candidate to succeed President Raul Castro in a transition aimed at ensuring that the country's single-party system outlasts the aging revolutionaries who created it. \n \n The certain approval of Diaz-Canel by members of the unfailingly unanimous National Assembly will install someone from outside the Castro family in the country's highest government office for the first time in nearly six decades. \n \n The 86-year-old Castro will remain head of the Communist Party, designated by the constitution as \"the superior guiding force of society and the state.\" As a result, Castro will remain the most powerful person in Cuba for the time being. His departure from the presidency is nonetheless a symbolically charged moment for a country accustomed to 60 years of absolute rule first by revolutionary leader Fidel Castro and, for the last decade, his younger brother. \n \n Facing biological reality but still active and apparently healthy, Raul Castro is stepping down as president in an effort to guarantee that new leaders can maintain the government's grip on power in the face of economic stagnation, an aging population and increasing disenchantment among younger generations. \n \n \"I like sticking with the ideas of President Fidel Castro because he did a lot for the people of Cuba, but we need rejuvenation, above all in the economy,\" said Melissa Mederos, a 21-year-old schoolteacher. \"Diaz-Canel needs to work hard on the economy, because people need to live a little better.\" \n \n Most Cubans know their first vice president as an uncharismatic figure who until recently maintained a public profile so low it was virtually nonexistent. That image changed slightly this year as state media placed an increasing spotlight on Diaz-Canel's public appearances, including remarks to the press last month that included his promise to make Cuba's government more responsive to its people. \n \n \"We're building a relationship between the government and the people here,\" he said then after casting a ballot for members of the National Assembly. \"The lives of those who will be elected have to be focused on relating to the people, listening to the people, investigating their problems and encouraging debate.\" \n \n Diaz-Canel gained prominence in central Villa Clara province as the top Communist Party official, a post equivalent to governor. There, people described him as a hard-working, modest-living technocrat dedicated to improving public services. He became higher education minister in 2009 before moving into the vice presidency. \n \n In a video of a Communist Party meeting that inexplicably leaked to the public last year, Diaz-Canel expressed a series of orthodox positions that included somberly pledging to shutter some independent media and labeling some European embassies as outposts of foreign subversion. \n \n But he has also defended academics and bloggers who became targets of hardliners, leading some to describe him a potential advocate for greater openness in a system intolerant of virtually any criticism or dissent. International observers and Cubans alike will be scrutinizing every move he makes after he officially takes office on Thursday. \n \n Two years after taking over from his ailing brother in 2006, Castro launched a series of reforms that expanded Cuba's private sector to nearly 600,000 people and allowed citizens greater freedom to travel and access to information. He has failed to fix the generally unproductive and highly subsidized state-run businesses that, along with a Soviet-model bureaucracy, employ three of every four Cubans. State salaries average $30 a month, leaving workers struggling to feed their families, and often dependent on corruption or remittances from relatives overseas. \n \n Castro's moves to open the economy have largely been frozen or reversed as soon as they began to generate conspicuous shows of wealth by the new entrepreneurial class in a country officially dedicated to equality among its citizens. \n \n \"I don't want to see a capitalist system, hopefully that doesn't come here, but we have to fix the economy,\" said Roberto Sanchez, a 41-year-old construction worker. \"I'd like to have more opportunity, to buy a car, and have a few possessions.\" \n \n As in Cuba's legislative elections, all of the leaders selected Wednesday were selected by a government-appointed commission. Ballots offer only the option of approval or disapproval and candidates generally receive more than 95 percent of the votes in their favor. \n \n The Candidacy Commission also nominated another six vice presidents of the Council of State, Cuba's highest government body. Only one, 85-year-old Ramiro Valdez, was among the revolutionaries who fought with the Castros in the late 1950s in the eastern Sierra Maestra mountains. \n \n State media went into overdrive Wednesday with a single message: Cuba's system is continuing in the face of change. Commentators on state television and online offered lengthy explanations of why Cuba's single-party politics and socialist economy are superior to multi-party democracy and free markets, and assured Cubans that no fundamental changes were occurring, despite some new faces at the top. \n \n \"It falls on our generation to give continuity to the revolutionary process,\" said assembly member Jorge Luis Torres, a municipal councilman from central Artemisa province who appeared to be in his 40s. \"We're a generation born after the revolution, whose responsibility is driving the destiny of the nation.\" \n \n Castro entered the National Assembly just after 9 a.m. accompanied by a broadly smiling Diaz-Canel. Ceremonies continued through lunchtime and broke until Thursday morning, when the new national leadership is expected to be officially announced on the anniversary of the defeat of U.S.-backed invaders at the Bay of Pigs in 1961. \n \n Fidel Castro was prime minister and president from 1959 until he fell ill in 2006. Although Osvaldo Dorticos was president of Cuba during Fidel Castro's time as prime minister, he was considered a figurehead beside the man who led Cuba's revolution, forged its single-party socialist system and ruled by fiat. \n \n ______ \n \n Associated Press Writer Ben Fox contributed to this report.",

The island is one of the few that remain deserted in Japan where according to locals, even fisherman rarely stop. \n \n Mr Nagasaki is among the few voluntary castaways who have spent decades on a deserted island; he has surpassed Australian castaway David Glasheen who this year celebrates 21 years on Restoration Island, off the coast of Far North Queensland. \n \n His recent eviction was detected by Alvaro Cerezo, who documents island castaways including the \u2018real life tarzan\u2019 who lived in the deepest jungles of Vietnam. \n \n There are no phones. No lighters. No fresh water \u2014 and not many clothes either. He braves typhoons and biting mosquitoes in the buff. \n \n \u2022 Woman dumps herself on deserted island \n \n \u2022 Real-life castaway: \u2018He\u2019s not afraid to die\u2019 \n \n \u2022 Castaway reveals difficulties of island life \n \n Mr Nagasaki\u2019s only wish was to die on the island he called home for the last three decades. \n \n \u201cFinding a place to die is an important thing to do, and I\u2019ve decided here is the place for me,\u201d he told Reuters in 2012. \n \n \u201cIt hadn\u2019t really occurred to me before how important it is to choose the place of your death, like whether it\u2019s in a hospital or at home with family by your side. But to die here, surrounded by nature \u2014 you just can\u2019t beat it, can you?\u201d \n \n He told Docastaway\u2019s Alvaro Cerezo, who spent five days on the island with Mr Nagasaki before his sudden departure: \u201cI don\u2019t want to move from here, I will protect this island. I will risk my life to protect this island. I will never find a paradise like this. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve never felt sad here, I cannot survive if I have those kinds of feelings. Things here are more realistic.\u201d \n \n Mr Nagasaki was so confident he said he \u201cwill never move from here even if the world changes\u201d. \n \n \u201cI won\u2019t leave even if someone tells me there is a better place. All that I want I can find it here. I don\u2019t need any thing else,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cI have no option, I\u2019ve already told my family I will die here. My wish is to die here without bothering any one, that\u2019s why I don\u2019t want to get sick or injured. I want to be killed by a typhoon, so nobody can try to save me. To die here is the best, its just perfect for me.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s unclear how Mr Nagasaki ended up on Sotobanari in the first place. At one point he was married and there are suspicions he has two children, but he \u201cdoesn\u2019t like to talk about his past\u201d, according to Mr Cerezo. \n \n He was believed to have been a photographer before escaping civilisation, but again, \u201che doesn\u2019t want to hear or talk about\u201d. He even apparently ran his own hostess club in Niigata, a port city in Honshu, Japan\u2019s main island. \n \n Mr Nagasaki said he was working in a factory in Osaka when one day a colleague told him about a mysterious archipelago and since then he dreamt of escaping from civilisation. One day, when on a flight, he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the amount of pollution he saw in the sea below and \u201cexploded\u201d. So the self-confessed \u201ccity man with no outdoor experience\u201d packed his bags and found his remote island hideaway. He thought he would stay perhaps two years max, but ended up clocking almost 30 years. \n \n \u201cIn civilisation people treated me like an idiot and made me feel like one. On this island I don\u2019t feel like that,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cHere, on the island I don\u2019t do what people tell me to do, I just follow nature\u2019s rules. You can\u2019t dominate nature so you have to obey it completely.\u201d \n \n Mr Nagasaki spent his first few years on the island clothed but when a typhoon swept through and destroyed his few belongings, he realised \u201cwearing clothes here was completely out of place for me\u201d and began to live life commando. \n \n \u201cWalking around naked doesn\u2019t really fit in with normal society, but here on the island it feels right, it\u2019s like a uniform,\u201d he told Reuters in 2012. \n \n \u201cIf you put on clothes you\u2019ll feel completely out of place.\u201d \n \n He\u2019s spent the rest of his time on the island naked and alone but he found friends in some strange places; he stopped eating meat and fish and refused to eat the vast number of turtle eggs left by its maternal visitors. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve seen those baby turtles being born and crawling towards the sea. I get goosebumps every time I see that. It makes me think how wonderful life is. \n \n \u201cThis environment makes me feel like that this island really changed me. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s good or bad, but I have no problem with it.\u201d \n \n Despite the freedom of a tropical paradise, Mr Nagasaki\u2019s routine was strict; gym session in the morning, followed by hours of beach cleaning with a pair pf white gloves and a rake. \n \n \u201cI have never seen a beach as clean as his, not even in the most luxurious island resorts,\u201d Mr Cerezo said. \n \n \u201cThey were five unforgettable days and I am extremely thankful to have had the opportunity to see through his eyes for the last time and enjoy his precious island.\u201d \n \n Fast forward to April 2018 and authorities have removed the 82-year-old and returned him back to civilisation. \n \n \u201cHe was kicked out of the island, someone saw him on the island and it seems like he was weak,\u201d Mr Cerezo told news.com.au. \n \n \u201cThey called the police and they took him back to civilisation and that\u2019s it. He couldn\u2019t even fight back because he was weak. They won\u2019t allow him to return.\u201d \n \n Mr Cerezo, whose business it is to find idyllic islands and host private visitors, said that since being removed, Mr Nagasaki is now living in the nearest city to the island, Ishigaki, 60 kilometres away in a government house. \n \n \u201cHis health is OK, he was probably only sick or had the flu [when he was taken] but they won\u2019t allow him to go back any more, he cannot go there, it\u2019s over.\u201d \n \n \u2014 For more information about Masafumi Nagasaki visit nagasaki.docastaway.com. \n \n \u2014 For more information on Alvaro Cerezo and Docastaway, visit docastaway.com \n \n \u2014 Continue the conversation with Matt Young on Facebook or Twitter ||||| SOTOBANARI ISLAND, Japan (Reuters) - Dangerous currents swirl around Sotobanari island, which has not a drop of natural water, and local fishermen rarely land there. \n \n Seventy-six-year-old naked hermit Masafumi Nagasaki sits at table made from polystyrene box as he eats a food on Sotobanari island, off western coast of Iriomote island, Okinawa prefecture, April 14, 2012.

When retirement came, he wanted to get far away from it all. \n \n He chose Sotobanari, which is roughly a 1,000 meters across and means \u201cOuter Distant island\u201d in the local dialect. It lies off the coast of Iriomote island, far closer to Taiwan than to Tokyo. \n \n His resolve was tested relatively soon into his stay when a massive typhoon swept over the island, scouring away most of the scrub he had counted on for shade, as well as carrying away the simple tent he lived in. \n \n \u201cI just scorched under the sun,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was at that point I thought this was going to be an impossible place to live.\u201d \n \n For the first year he lived on Sotobanari, he threw on clothes whenever boats passed his way. But slowly the island stripped away his embarrassment. \n \n \u201cWalking around naked doesn\u2019t really fit in with normal society, but here on the island it feels right, it\u2019s like a uniform,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you put on clothes you\u2019ll feel completely out of place.\u201d \n \n Slideshow (7 Images) \n \n He does throw on clothes once a week for a trip to a settlement an hour away by boat, where he buys food and drinking water.

Water for bathing and shaving comes from rainwater caught in a system of battered cooking pots. \n \n Each day is conducted according to a strict timetable, starting with stretches in the sun on the beach. The rest is a race against time as he prepares food, washes and cleans his camp before the light fails and insects come out to bite. \n \n It isn\u2019t the healthiest of lifestyles, he concedes - but that isn\u2019t the point. \n \n \u201cFinding a place to die is an important thing to do, and I\u2019ve decided here is the place for me,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cIt hadn\u2019t really occurred to me before how important it is to choose the place of your death, like whether it\u2019s in a hospital or at home with family by your side.

But that didn't stop Masafumi Nagasaki from heading to the uninhabited Japanese island of Sotobanari for what he thought would be a two-year respite from the rest of the world. That was in 1989, as the man who came to be known as the \"naked hermit\" ended up sticking around until this past April, a nearly 30-year stay all by his lonesome. The 82-year-old, who long ago eschewed clothing, technology, and other creature comforts and had hoped to die on the island, was removed earlier this year after someone reportedly called authorities out of concern he'd become too weak, documentary maker Alvaro Cerezo tells News.com.au. \"They took him back to civilization and that's it,\" Cerezo says. \"They won't allow him to return.\" Cerezo spent five days with Nagasaki before he was booted from his \"paradise,\" where he insists he was never lonely, bored, or sad. A 2012 Reuters article reported Nagasaki did don clothing once a week to make a boat trip to a settlement an hour away to buy food and water; he'd also collect an allowance sent from his family. Speaking of family, Nagasaki was once married and may have had a couple of kids, but he \"doesn't like to talk about his past,\" Cerezo notes. What he missed most from his former life while he was holed up on the island: lighters, per the documentary. What he didn't miss: money and religion. \"[Those] two things are destroying the world,\" he says. He also wished he could have been killed by a typhoon during his stay so \"nobody [would] try to save me.\" Nagasaki is now living in a government house in a city about 40 miles away from his beloved island. (This man is one of central Europe's last hermits.)",

It turned out to be more than 30 years, reports news.com.au. The 82-year-old\u2014known as the \"naked hermit\"\u2014has become the longest-living \"voluntary castaway\" in the world, having spent all but two years of his life on the island, which is one of the few that still exists in the country. \"To die here, surrounded by nature\u2014you just can't beat it, can you?\" he told news.com.au in 2012. \"I've already told my family I will die here. My wish is to die here without bothering any one, that's why I don't want to get sick or injured. I want to be killed by a typhoon, so nobody can try to save me. To die here is the best, its just perfect for me.\" It's not clear how Nagasaki ended up on Sotobanari in the first place. He worked in a factory in Osaka and dreamed of escaping civilization one day when he saw the ocean below and \"exploded,\" he told Reuters in 2012. \"In civilization people treated me like an idiot and made me feel like one,\" he said. \"On this island I don't do what people tell me to do, I just follow nature's rules. You can't dominate nature, so you have to obey it completely.\" When a typhoon hit a typhoon struck a few years ago, he lost his cellphone and his cell phone was dead, but didn't have any money or anything to get any job he needed when he needed to get when he was able to get that he could get that he could get that he could get anything, which he could get anything.com.com.com.com.com.com comes to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get to get",

He immediately called police and turned the money in to authorities. \n \n Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood was so impressed by the good deed, he said at the time that he believed the money should go to Tracey, a SEPTA worker, if nobody claimed the cash. \n \n And this week \u2013 after more than a year \u2013 a judge agreed with him. \n \n On Monday, Delaware County Court of Common Pleas Judge Charles Burr II ordered the money returned to Tracey, according to court documents. \n \n Although Chitwood believed the money should have been returned to Tracey within 90 days if the owner did not come forward, Tracey was forced to petition the courts in September to get the money returned, as was first reported by the Delaware County Daily Times. \n \n According to Tracey's petition, under state law \"a finder of lost property has a valid claim for title of that property against all persons except the true owner.\" \n \n It's unclear why Tracey's legal battle dragged on for six months.

Inside he found \"multiple stacks of cash-money wrapped in bank wrapping,\" according to the petition. \n \n Chitwood said police also discovered a digital scale, a crack-cocaine pipe, and a vial of unidentified liquid in the bag. \n \n After news broke of Tracey's find \u2013 and his subsequent good deed \u2013 Chitwood said police received a couple of calls from people claiming the money was theirs, but they had no proof.

    "document": "BOSTON, Mass. \u2014 American journalist James Foley was murdered by Islamic State militants, who on Aug. 19 publicized the killing in a graphic video uploaded to YouTube. \n \n On Tuesday, Aug. 12, Foley\u2019s parents received an email from their son\u2019s captors stating that Foley would be \u201cexecuted.\u201d The Foley family, GlobalPost, government authorities and private security consultants had been investigating Foley\u2019s whereabouts and attempting to secure his release since he was kidnapped on Thanksgiving Day nearly two years ago. \n \n The terrorist group declared Foley's death would be in retaliation for recent US airstrikes against the Islamic State in Iraq. \n \n The Islamic State, which is now holding three American hostages in Syria, has since threatened to kill one of them, freelance reporter Steven Sotloff, if the US continues its bombing campaign in Iraq. \n \n The Foley family has agreed to release the email from Foley\u2019s captors. GlobalPost has chosen to publish it in full in the interest of transparency and to fully tell Jim's story. We believe the text offers insight into the motivations and tactics of the Islamic State. \n \n In addition to the extreme views it espouses, the email contains factual inaccuracies. For example, the Foley family was not \u201cgiven many chances to negotiate\u201d for Jim\u2019s release. After more than a year without contact, the Foleys received their first message from Jim\u2019s captors on Nov. 26, 2013, asking for money, fast. After the militants had proved to the Foleys and investigators that they were in fact holding Jim, they made their sole demand for a ransom of 100 million euros (about $132 million) or the release of unspecified prisoners held by the United States. \n \n The next time the Foley family heard from the captors was on Aug. 12, 2014. They received this email: \n \n HOW LONG WILL THE SHEEP FOLLOW THE BLIND SHEPPARD? \n \n A message to the American government and their sheep like citizens: \n \n We have left you alone since your disgraceful defeat in Iraq. We did not interfere in your country or attack your citizens while they were safe in their homes despite our capability to do so! \n \n As for the scum of your society who are held prisoner by us, THEY DARED TO ENTER THE LION\u2019S DEN AND WHERE EATEN! \n \n You were given many chances to negotiate the release of your people via cash transactions as other governments have accepted, \n \n We have also offered prisoner exchanges to free the Muslims currently in your detention like our sister Dr Afia Sidiqqi, however you proved very quickly to us that this is NOT what you are interested in. \n \n You have no motivation to deal with the Muslims except with the language of force, a language you were given in \u201cArabic translation\u201d when you attempted to occupy the land of Iraq! \n \n Now you return to bomb the Muslims of Iraq once again, this time resorting to Arial attacks and \u201cproxy armies\u201d, all the while cowardly shying away from a face-to-face confrontation! \n \n Today our swords are unsheathed towards you, GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENS ALIKE! AND WE WILL NOT STOP UNTILL WE QUENCH OUR THIRST FOR YOUR BLOOD. \n \n You do not spare our weak, elderly, women or children so we will NOT spare yours! \n \n You and your citizens will pay the price of your bombings! \n \n The first of which being the blood of the American citizen, James Foley! \n \n He will be executed as a DIRECT result of your transgressions towards us! ||||| \n \n \u201cJihadi John\u201d (Rex Features via AP Images) \n \n The horrifying video of James Foley\u2019s execution is dominated by three colors. The orange of Foley\u2019s tunic. The taupe of the desert. And the black of an Islamic State militant\u2019s uniform \u2014 a uniform worn by a man speaking with what experts think is a British accent. In the span of two days, the masked man has become perhaps the world\u2019s most notorious terrorist. \n \n But despite the infamy, he remains enigmatic. Where did he come from? How old is he? What drove him to such extremism? \n \n Answers to those questions are unclear. But the militant now has an identity. As per the British press, the masked man is known as \u201cJihadi John.\u201d The nickname speaks to claims slowly trickling out about the killer. \n \n John\u2019s accent, which experts contend signifies London origins, is the source of his alias, the BBC reported in a radio broadcast on Thursday. John is believed to lead a small cadre of three British militants who guard the Islamic State\u2019s foreign hostages. Because of their captors\u2019 accents, hostages called them \u201cJohn, Paul and Ringo after the Beatles,\u201d the BBC\u2019s Frank Gardner reported on Thursday. \n \n It\u2019s not surprising that Foley\u2019s executioner was a foreigner \u2014 specifically, a Briton. Militants from Britain account for a larger proportion of the Islamic State\u2019s forces than nearly every other Western country. Estimates place their number anywhere from 800 to 1,500. Today, more British Muslims may fight for the Islamic State than for Britain\u2019s own military, according to USA Today and the Times of London, underscoring the militants\u2019 presence in the United Kingdom. Recruiters recently passed out Islamic State propaganda in London advocating enlistment, and supporters flew a black jihadist flag there earlier this month. \n \n Such fighters are more radicalized than other members of the Islamic State. \u201cForeign fighters are often used for the most brutal acts because they are the most ideologically motivated,\u201d Peter Neumann, director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization, told The Washington Post\u2019s Griff Witte. \u201cThe locals may say, \u2018That\u2019s not the kind of thing we do here.\u2019 But the outsiders don\u2019t know that.\u201d \n \n Of particular brutality was James Foley\u2019s executioner. John is an \u201cintelligent, educated and a devout believer in radical Islamic teachings,\u201d according to the Guardian, which interviewed a hostage who was also held captive by him. He is reported to have led negotiations with at least eight Western families in the past year for the release of their loved ones, and may have been involved last spring when Islamic State militants released two Spanish journalists. \n \n But the Islamic State\u2019s correspondence with Foley\u2019s family was different. The group demanded the astronomical sum of $132 million for his release, a \u201cnumber so absurdly high that private third parties or insurance groups that cover kidnappings would have struggled to pay it,\u201d wrote The Post\u2019s Adam Taylor. It was so high, in fact, that most experts agree the Islamic State never expected to get paid. Foley, it seemed, would be reserved for something else. \n \n John and the rest of the guards disliked Foley. They seized his laptop, and their subsequent discovery that Foley\u2019s brother served in the U.S. Air Force stirred acts of recrimination, fellow hostage Didier Francois told Europe 1 Radio. \u201cBeing an American, he was probably more targeted by the kidnappers,\u201d another captured French journalist told the BBC. \u201cWell, he would be beaten a bit more probably, he was some kind of scapegoat. And the kidnappers knew that his brother was in the U.S. Air Force. He became the whipping-boy of the jailers.\u201d \n \n One particularly brutal scene came right before Francois\u2019s release in April of this year. The jihadists began to perform mock executions on Foley. \u201cOne of the last times I saw him before leaving, the group \u2014 which has macabre taste \u2014 had forced him to pose as if he was being crucified against a wall,\u201d Fran\u00e7ois said, according to the Wall Street Journal.. \n \n Finally, on Aug. 12, days before Foley\u2019s execution, his captors sent a final e-mail to Foley\u2019s family. The publication Foley wrote for, GlobalPost, published the letter in full with the permission of Folely\u2019s family. \n \n \u201cHOW LONG WILL THE SHEEP FOLLOW THE BLIND SHEPPARD?\u201d it read. \u201c\u2026As for the scum of your society who are held by us, THEY DARED TO ENTER THE LION\u2019S DEN AND WHERE EATEN! \u2026 Today our swords are unsheathed towards you, GOVERNMENT AND CITIZENS ALIKE! AND WE WILL NOT STOP UNTILL WE QUENCH OUR THIRST FOR YOUR BLOOD. \u2026 You and your citizens will pay the price of your bombings! The first of which being the blood of the American citizen, James Foley! He will be executed as a DIRECT result of your transgressions toward us!\u201d ||||| Up to 20 Western hostages are being held by the jihadi group that beheaded James Foley. \n \n As well as the journalist Steven Sotloff, who was threatened with beheading by the same man who murdered Foley, Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (Isil) is holding a number of aid workers, thought to include Vanessa Marzullo, 21, and Greta Ramelli, 20, both Italian. \n \n Three aid workers employed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) are also being held hostage after they were abducted last October. \n \n As fears grew that Isil could make good on its threat to murder more hostages, families of those being held defended their loved ones\u2019 decisions to travel to Syria. \n \n Ms Ramelli\u2019s mother, Antonella, said her daughter had been determined from an early age to look after others, starting by helping out in a retirement home when she was 12. \n \n Responding to suggestions that she should not have allowed her daughter to travel to Syria, Mrs Ramelli said: \u201cWhen you hear your daughter say 'Mamma, in that country they are killing children, I must go and help,\u2019 what can you say?\u201d \n \n \u201cCan you go back on all the teaching and the values you have tried to instill for a lifetime?\u201d she told Prealpina, an Italian newspaper. \u201cCan you change your daughter, who has these values and has strong ideals about solidarity and human empathy?\u201d \n \n The two women went missing near Aleppo in Syria at the beginning of this month. On Thursday the Italian foreign office declined to comment on whether they were now in the hands of Isil. \n \n The Red Cross has not released details of the nationality, gender or age of their aid workers currently being held hostage. The three were among a group of seven who were kidnapped, four of whom were released shortly afterwards. \n \n A spokesman for the charity said: \u201cIntensive efforts are ongoing behind the scenes to secure the release of the remaining three colleagues, through the ICRC\u2019s broad network on the ground. \n \n \"We cannot provide details about this for the sake of the ongoing safety of our colleagues still abducted.\u201d \n \n Former hostages who had been held with Foley described how he had been singled out for beatings because he was an American. \n \n Didier Francois, a 53-year-old reporter with the French radio station Europe 1, said Mr Foley was tortured after his captors found pictures on his computer of his brother, who works for the US Air Force. \n \n Foley was subjected to mock executions, including one in which he was \u201ccrucified against a wall\u201d. \n \n Paying tribute to the American, Mr Francois said: \u201cHe was an extraordinary guy \u2014 a companion in imprisonment who was very agreeable, very solid.\u201d \n \n Mr Francois spent eight months held hostage in Syria with Foley, mostly in underground cells with no natural light. \n \n For two-and-a-half months, Mr Francois was chained to fellow French hostages Nicolas Henin, Edouard Elias, and Pierre Torres. Mr Francois said he had never spoken publicly about Mr Foley or Mr Sotloff before because of threats of reprisals. \n \n Mr Henin also paid tribute to Mr Foley, saying: \u201cJames was a very good friend and a great support. He was always there when you were feeling not so well with some kind words. He managed to make seven months of captivity easier.\u201d \n \n Mr Henin, however, was sceptical about reports that a group of British jihadists nicknamed \u201cThe Beatles\u201d were the prime culprits. \u201cIf investigators were to go in that direction, they would be misleading themselves,\u201d he said. \n \n Jeroen Oerlemans, a Dutch journalist who was held hostage in Syria with a British colleague, John Cantlie, for nine days last year before the two men were freed, said Foley had worked tirelessly trying to secure their release. \n \n He said: \u201cThe colleague with whom I was abducted was good friends with James. When we missed our appointment with him, somewhere in Syria, alarm bells immediately went off for Foley. He pulled back across the border to Turkey, and put all his journalistic contacts gathering information on us.\u201d \n \n When the two men were freed by opposition forces, he said: \u201cJames was the first to hug me.

(Photo: Mike Siegel, AP) Story Highlights Federal Highway Administration estimates repairs would cost $76 billion \n \n Average age of the structurally deficient bridges is 65 years old \n \n One expert says: 'We've never had a better bridge system\" \n \n More than one in nine bridges in the USA \u2014 at least 66,405, or 11% of the total \u2014 are structurally deficient, according to a new report. \n \n These are not rarely used, out-of-the way structures: Each day, Americans take 260 million trips over structurally deficient bridges, says the report from Transportation for America, a Washington, D.C.-based coalition that works to improve transportation. \n \n The report comes less than a month after the May 23 collapse of a span of the Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River in Washington state. Part of the bridge collapsed when it was struck by a truck with an oversize load. That bridge, built in 1955, was not structurally deficient. \n \n The structurally deficient bridges are 65 years old on average, and the Federal Highway Administration estimates that repairing them would cost $76 billion. \n \n A structurally deficient bridge isn't necessarily one that's dangerous or about to collapse; rather, they are bridges that require significant maintenance, rehabilitation or replacement. \n \n A truck is removed May 27 from the wreckage of an Interstate 5 bridge over the Skagit River in Mount Vernon, Wash. That bridge, which was built in 1955 and collapsed May 23, was not structurally deficient. (Photo: Washington State Department of Transportation via AP) \n \n The repair bill will likely increase as many of the nation's most heavily traveled bridges, including those built as part of the interstate system, near the end of their expected life spans. \"You're seeing the aging of the system,\" says David Goldberg, a co-author of the report. \"It really does parallel the (aging of) the Baby Boomers in a startling way.\" \n \n This is a problem that has worsened since Transportation for America's last report on bridges, in 2011: Fifteen states have seen an increase in their structurally deficient bridges. The report projects that in 10 years, one in four bridges will be 65 years old or older. \n \n In the two-year federal transportation funding bill it passed last year, Congress eliminated a dedicated fund for bridge repair. \"The upshot is that bridge repair now must compete with other transportation needs,\" the report says. Money previously targeted for bridge repair was rolled into a new National Highway Performance Program, which can be spent only on highways that are part of the National Highway System, which includes interstates and major state highways. Nearly 90% of structurally deficient bridges are not part of the National Highway System. \n \n Transportation for America recommends that Congress raise new dedicated revenues for transportation programs including bridges; that 180,000 bridges be made eligible for the new funding program, and that repair of bridges and highways be made a national priority. \n \n Not everyone is alarmed over the state of the nation's bridges. \"From my perspective, we've never had a better bridge system than we have right now,\" says David Hartgen, senior fellow at the libertarian Reason Foundation who co-authored a February report on the condition of roads and bridges in the USA. \"The overall system is getting better slowly and steadily over time\" as states work to improve their roads and bridges. \n \n Hartgen, emeritus professor of transportation studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, says it's good that more responsibility for repairing bridges is shifted from the federal government to the states. \"The states are closer to the problem,\" he says. \"I'm not overly pessimistic about the funding picture. At the state level, there is more willingness to raise state taxes for bridges.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/11XSsQ1 ||||| Elaine Thompson / AP The north end of the Interstate 5 bridge crossing the Skagit River lies collapsed in the water on Friday, in Mount Vernon, Wash. A truck carrying an oversize load struck the four-lane bridge on the major thoroughfare between Seattle and Canada, sending a section of the span and two vehicles into the Skagit River below Thursday evening. All three occupants suffered only minor injuries. At an overnight news conference, Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste blamed the collapse on a tractor-trailer carrying a tall load that hit an upper part of the span. \n \n The Washington state bridge collapse that spilled two cars into the Skagit River could give Americans pause as they hit the roads for Memorial Day holiday travel. \n \n With good reason. \n \n This weekend, millions will cross 66,000 bridges that the federal government has deemed \"structurally deficient,\" meaning key elements are in poor condition. \n \n The Federal Highway Administration hastens to note that label doesn't mean they are unsafe or in danger of collapse, but transportation advocates say it highlights a growing crisis of aging infrastructure, deferred maintenance and rebuilding, and design flaws. \n \n \"We don't expect an epidemic of collapses \u2014 that's the extreme,\" said Dan Goldberg, communications director for Transportation for America, a coalition that identified the busiest deficient bridges in the nation in a 2011 report. \n \n \"We are going to see probably some more of this, but the more likely scenario is contending with the issues of decay that happen before the collapse.\" \n \n Big potholes, weight restrictions and lane closings are some of the inconveniences bridge users face unless reconstruction and replacement is ramped up across the nation, Goldberg said. \n \n The Interstate 5 bridge in Mount Vernon, Wash., which apparently crumpled after being hit by an oversized truck, was not on the Federal Highway Administration's structurally-deficient list. \n \n Famed spans aren't the problem. San Francisco's Golden Gate, for instance, is in pretty good shape. The Brooklyn Bridge is undergoing a massive rehabilitation project to correct its deficiencies. \n \n But hundreds of less glamorous bridges \u2014 many of them generic overpasses that take commuters over cross streets or other highways \u2014 remain vulnerable. \n \n Here are six crossings, together used by more than 1 million vehicles each day, that don't make the grade: \n \n Maryland DOT A view of I-695 crossing over Liberty Road in Maryland in August 2012. \n \n I-76 over Klemm Ave. in Gloucester, N.J.: The deck and superstructure are in poor condition on this 11-lane interstate overpass that dates to 1956. More than 191,000 vehicles use it every day, and $30 million has been earmarked for deck replacement. \n \n IS-695 over Milford Mill Road in Baltimore, Md.: Built in 1961 and reconstructed in 1979, this eight-lane overpass on the Baltimore Beltway has a deck and substructure in poor condition.

The substructure of the two-lane approach, built in 1961, is in poor condition. \n \n I-95 over Hendricks Ave. in Jacksonville, Fla.: The deck is in poor condition on this nine-lane section of interstate that handles 121,000 vehicles a day. Built in 1959 and reconstructed in 1989, it is undergoing a replacement. \n \n Source: Information about the structures was compiled by Nationalbridges.com, a website that analyzes data in the Federal Highway Administration's national bridge inventory. ||||| Visualizing the numbers \n \n Did you know that in another ten years, one in four bridges will be 65 years old or older?

Simon, who was accused nearly 40 years ago of killing 14 random victims and wounding seven others on San Francisco streets, died alone in his cell of unknown causes Thursday night, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. He was pronounced dead at 11:59 p.m. inside the prison. \n \n \u201cThe cause of death is pending an autopsy,\u201d said Krissi Khokhobashvili, a spokeswoman for the corrections department. \u201cAll that can be released at this point is that he was unresponsive in his cell.\u201d \n \n The 69-year-old Simon was convicted in San Francisco of two counts of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder and assault with a deadly weapon in 1976 after the killing spree, which prompted what authorities said was the biggest manhunt in the city\u2019s history. He was serving a life sentence with the possibility of parole when he died. \n \n Simon and three other black men \u2014 Larry Green, Manuel Moore and Jessie Lee Cooks \u2014 went on a six-month rampage from October 1973 to April 1974.

The slayings were called the \u201cZebra\u201d murders because of the special radio band, the Z channel, that investigators used. \n \n The seven victims who survived the attacks were crucial in finding the culprits, detectives said. \n \n One of the survivors was future Mayor Art Agnos, who was then a 35-year-old social worker. He had left a meeting in Potrero Hill on Dec. 13, 1973, and was walking to his car when he said he heard a loud popping noise at Wisconsin and 23rd streets. Agnos at first tried to calm the people fleeing the gunshots when he realized he had been shot twice in the back. \n \n The intensive manhunt, overseen by Mayor Joseph Alioto, lasted several months and included a $30,000 reward for information about the killers. At one point the mayor authorized police to stop and question any black man who resembled witnesses\u2019 descriptions. The practice, which resulted in the questioning of hundreds of innocent men, was eventually halted by a federal judge. \n \n Police, acting on a tip by an informant, eventually raided an apartment complex at 844 Grove St., in the old Fillmore district. Seven men were arrested, but only Cooks, Green, Moore and Simons were charged. \n \n The killings were among several horrific and bloody events in the late 1960s and 1970s by San Francisco radicals, including the Zodiac serial killer, the Symbionese Liberation Army and the Rev. Jim Jones, who forced his followers to drink cyanide-laced punch. Dan White also murdered Mayor George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk that decade. \n \n The four Zebra killers were convicted and sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, which has been denied repeatedly. \n \n Green, 63, is serving his sentence at California State Prison-Solano in Vacaville; Moore, 70, is at Ironwood State Prison (Riverside County); and Cooks, 70, is at Richard J.

    "document": "It is true that Ms. Kardashian, along with her sisters Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9, and their mother, Kris Jenner, command a branding empire that includes fashion boutiques, fitness videos, credit cards, a best-selling fragrance, skin care products and a self tanner. Ms. Kardashian herself has represented many other products in advertisements, including some that a reasonable person might consider to be sending mixed messages. In one ad she promotes QuickTrim weight-loss products; in another, Carl\u2019s Jr. While it is not unusual for celebrities who are famous for being famous to aggressively capitalize on their exposure, Ms. Kardashian, who made her debut on the public stage in the form of a sex tape, stands out for the fact that she is generally still regarded in a positive light by many consumers. \n \n Mr. Passikoff, the president of Brand Keys, a New York research company that monitors consumer perception of brands, noted that Ms. Kardashian is currently tied with Snooki at the top of its celebrity loyalty index, a survey that gauges consumer engagement with celebrities. Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian also figure in the top seven. \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cThere was a time when Paris Hilton topped that list, when she was the most famous person for being nothing we had ever seen,\u201d Mr. Passikoff said. (Ms. Hilton is now in third place.) Interestingly, he noted, many consumers associate Ms. Kardashian with entrepreneurship, far more so than other celebrities. \n \n Outside Bebe, though, a more complicated picture emerged as to what draws all these young people to Ms. Kardashian. Most of them had heard about the event on Twitter, and most said they saw something inspiring in her example. But what does she represent? \n \n \u201cThe average girl,\u201d said Julie Sunday, 22, from Scranton, Pa., who recently left a job doing accounting work for a political media buying company in Washington. \n \n \u201cShe represents fashion,\u201d said Wendy Sosa, 22, a waitress from the Bronx. \u201cI like the way she dresses.\u201d \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cShe has an ethnic sex appeal,\u201d said Sarah Harooni, 26, a paralegal from Queens. \u201cI like how she created a franchise with her sisters. That opens a lot of opportunities for women who have a spark of beauty and want to shine. She reminds me of Sophia Loren.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cShe stands out from every other celebrity in the world,\u201d said Emma Brodel, 21, a journalism student from Queensland, Australia. \u201cShe is natural and curvaceous. There are too many thin celebrities out there who make women feel they are overweight.\u201d \n \n Ms. Kardashian, who is 30, is unfailingly polite when discussing her brand, one that was largely created through her public exposure since 2007 on the E! reality show \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d She does not talk about fashion and image as most designers and celebrity designers do, with platitudes about quality and authenticity, but rather as a person who seems wholly content to allow consumers to project upon her whatever image they wish. \n \n \u201cI really do believe I am a brand for my fans,\u201d she said. \n \n She does not talk about design in terms of cut or craft, either, but of Twitter and Facebook, of blogs and text messages. When fans ask her what she is wearing or what lip gloss she uses, she answers them and then creates products in the vein of what they like. When she was deciding on a color for her Kim Kardashian perfume bottle, she asked her followers on Twitter whether they preferred a hot pink or a light pink. (It was light pink, by far.) \u201cTwitter is the most amazing focus group out there,\u201d she said. \n \n Photo \n \n But ultimately, what Ms. Kardashian and her sisters create and sell are products based on their own image, and not much of it is particularly distinctive from the standard uniforms of Southern California nightclubs. At Bebe, the best-selling item has been a slinky one-shoulder dress for $98. At QVC, one of the most popular items on its Web site has been a slinky one-shoulder dress for $49.75. Both collections have leggings that can be worn with cute printed tunics. All of her jewelry collections have a slightly vintage feel and strong influences of Armenian design, reflecting Ms. Kardashian\u2019s familial roots. \n \n \u201cI try to find inspiration from what is on the runway,\u201d Ms. Kardashian said. \u201cBut I think hoops are a staple. Whether or not they are in, we always get compliments on them.\u201d \n \n The Bebe jewelry, priced from $24 to $98, includes Lucite hoops accented with gold flakes and gold hoops trimmed with what look like tiny jewels, which Ms. Kardashian wore to her store appearance Tuesday. \n \n \u201cWe make the kind of clothes we like to wear,\u201d she said. \u201cWe give answers to the questions our customers are asking.

What is Kim besides hot? She's single AND SHE HATES IT. Last week, Kim appeared on the cover of PEOPLE magazine with the cover line: \"I thought I'd be married by now.\"Inside, she told the mag: \"If you were to ask me in high school where I would be at 30, I would have said I'd be a housewife with four kids.\"Fortunately for Kim, the single businesswoman is a pretty big niche. Her PEOPLE declaration made single women between 25 and 35 everywhere say, \"Yes, I thought I would be married by now too. Thank you Kim. Now I relate to you, and where can I buy your perfume?\" Or something along those lines.\"It's not only appealing for the Kardashians to appeal to a broader set of demographics, but they do so in the context of a family unit, which allows them to differentiate themselves further. It also makes them more relatable to audiences in the context of friends and family,\" explains Nelson Gayton, executive director of the Center for Management of Enterprise in Media, Entertainment & Sports at UCLA's Anderson School of Management. \"The life experiences of each woman create a rooting interest in the family that perpetuates interest in each one of them, thereby growing their audience for their core brand.\"These ladies (with some help from Kris) know exactly what they're doing. If Kim gets hitched, we fully expect Kourtney to ditch Scott and move into her sister's single shoes, followed in short order by a Khloe pregnancy announcement. They're evil marketing geniuses through and through. Now, where can I get that perfume?",

A New York Times profile acknowledges that for every person who hates her (her fans are \"classless, tasteless, and clueless sheep,\" says one) there are many more who will follow her on Twitter, wear her clothes, buy products she's endorsed, and even compare her to Sophia Loren (yes, really). \"You would have had to be living in a cave in Nepal to have not been exposed in one way or another to the celebrity ilk of Kim Kardashian,\" says one branding expert.

    "document": "Mr. Wolfe said he took responsibility for the anger and frustration on campus, asserting that conversations with community leaders, students, faculty, donors and others led him to his decision, more than just the football players\u2019 threatened boycott. \n \n \u201cWhat was starting to become clear was the frustration and anger was evident, and it was something that needed to be done that was immediate and substantial for us to heal,\u201d Mr. Wolfe said at a news conference. \n \n As the two resignations were announced, the Board of Curators unveiled a slate of new initiatives to address racial tensions on campus, including hiring a diversity, inclusion and equity officer for the entire University of Missouri system. The university will also provide additional support to students, faculty and staff members who experience discrimination; create a task force to create plans for improving diversity and inclusion; and require diversity and inclusion training for all faculty, staff members and incoming students. \n \n Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, praised the protests as showing \u201cthat a few people speaking up and speaking out can have a profound impact.\u201d \n \n Officials said Mr. Loftin would remain at the university in a research role. \n \n Opposition to the administration reached a peak in the last week. A graduate student, Jonathan Butler, who was a veteran of the Ferguson protests, held a highly publicized hunger strike, saying he would not eat again until Mr. Wolfe was gone. Protesters formed an encampment on campus. A coalition of Jewish groups told Mr. Loftin that they were \u201cdismayed\u201d by his lack of action after a swastika was drawn on a dormitory wall. Deans of nine of its schools called for Mr. Loftin\u2019s removal. \n \n On Monday morning, the student government demanded Mr. Wolfe\u2019s ouster, and much of the faculty sent word to students that classes were canceled for two days, in favor of a teach-in focused on race relations. ||||| On the campus of the University of Missouri, graduate student Jonathan Butler has been starving himself in an effort to remove the school\u2019s president Tim Wolfe from his position. Today, on the seventh day of his protest, Butler won. \n \n Butler\u2019s protest was never a solitary one\u2014he is the face of a student group calling itself Concerned Student 1950\u2014but the speed with which it metastasized and engulfed the university had to have surprised Wolfe. \n \n Butler and his allies were, broadly speaking, protesting the treatment of minority (primarily black) students on Missouri\u2019s campus. Butler said that he would not eat until Wolfe\u2014the president of the University of Missouri System, which encompasses both the flagship campus in Columbia as well as smaller colleges across the state\u2014resigned his position. Wolfe, even in the face of growing attention and pressure, as the story became a national one, had refused to do so. On Sunday he stood his ground in a statement, but by then, his position had clearly become untenable. \n \n \n \n On Saturday night, the black members of the school\u2019s football team announced that they would not practice nor play until Wolfe was no longer the school\u2019s president, and Butler had resumed eating. On Sunday, the team\u2019s coach, Gary Pinkel, released a statement saying that his coaching staff and team were united, and would not participate in any football activities until Wolfe resigned or was removed. That was going to include the team\u2019s next game, on Saturday, against Brigham Young University, which is scheduled to air on an ESPN network. \n \n At Missouri, an SEC school, football is big business. Pinkel, the coach, makes $4 million per year; Wolfe, the president, made less than $500,000. The football program institutionally supporting its black players protesting along with Butler was probably this situation\u2019s greatest possible escalator\u2014it\u2019s what made Butler\u2019s protest into a topic of coverage for ESPN\u2014but the players, too, weren\u2019t acting alone. A group of teachers called the Concerned Faculty Group announced this morning that they would be conducting a two-day walkout in support of Butler and Concerned Student 1950. The school\u2019s student government also released a statement this morning demanding Wolfe\u2019s resignation. State legislators, including Columbia\u2019s representative and the chairman of the state House\u2019s Committee on Higher Education, both of whom are Republicans, also called on Wolfe to resign. Wolfe was under attack from just about every conceivable side, and despite his obstinacy, his resignation was not a question of \u201cif,\u201d but \u201cwhen.\u201d \n \n So, what brought us here? It\u2019s perhaps easiest to work backwards. On October 10, during the school\u2019s annual homecoming parade, Butler and other members of Concerned Student 1950 blockaded the vintage convertible that was carrying Wolfe. According to witnesses, the driver of the convertible revved the car\u2019s engine while it was stopped before eventually bumping into Butler. The group was also heckled by parade attendees. Wolfe was reportedly silent during the protest. \n \n Butler began his hunger strike in response to Wolfe, over the subsequent month, refusing to acknowledge that demonstration or the reasons for which it was carried out. The aim of the homecoming parade protest was to draw attention to what Butler and Concerned Student 1950 say is an inhospitable campus climate for minorities. In a letter announcing his hunger strike, Butler referenced several incidents: \n \n On September 12, student body president Payton Head wrote on Facebook that he had been called a \u201cnigger\u201d while walking through campus. It was not the first instance, and the school\u2019s Legion of Black Collegians say the slur was also used against them while they were rehearsing a play outdoors on October 5. In his Facebook post, Head also wrote about the on-campus oppression faced by LGBT, disabled, Muslim and female students. \n \n On October 24, a swastika was drawn in feces on the bathroom wall of a residence hall. \n \n In September, the university announced it was removing the hospital privileges of Colleen McNicholas, a doctor who performed abortions at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Columbia. Per the Kansas City Star, state law dictates that \u201ca doctor can only perform abortions if he or she has clinical privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where the abortions are taking place.\u201d The school\u2019s decision effectively ended abortion in Columbia. \n \n Earlier in the fall semester, the school announced that it was revoking health insurance subsidies for graduate students. After an immediate backlash, the policy was reversed. \n \n Though these were the recent incidents that sparked the protest that led to Wolfe\u2019s resignation, the oppression felt, and indignities suffered, by minority students and faculty did not, of course, begin just this semester. Cynthia Frisby, a professor at the school\u2019s historic and loudly trumpeted journalism school, has lived in Columbia for 18 years. She wrote in a Facebook post that she had \u201cbeen called the n word too many times to count.\u201d She also wrote specifically of several disturbing incidents of racism: \n \n Some of you may recall my most recent experience while jogging on Route K in May of 2015 when I was approached by a white man in a white truck with a confederate flag very visible and proudly displayed. He leaned out his window (now keep in mind I run against traffic so his behavior was a blatant sign that something was about to happen). Not only did he spit at me, he called me the n-word and gave me the finger. Of course, I responded with \u201cOh yea, get out of your car you coward and say that to my face.\u201d He then raced off. Typical. Others of you may recall that after the Zimmerman trial, I wrote about my experiences being called the n word twice while I was on my jog. And yes, I have had a few faculty call me the n word and treat me with incredible disrespect. Yes, faculty. I have had a student who said he couldn\u2019t call me Dr. Frisby because that would mean that he thinks I am smart and he was told that blacks are not smart and do not earn degrees without affirmative action. Yes, true story. I have so many stories to share that it just doesn\u2019t make sense to put them all here. \n \n In my final year as a student at Mizzou, cotton balls were thrown onto the lawn of the Black Culture Center, which is centrally located on campus, during Black History Month. In 2011, a racial slur was spray painted onto a statue outside a residence hall. In 2012, racist flyers were posted in another dorm. \n \n In the wake of the graffiti incident, the school launched a \u201cdiversity initiative\u201d called One Mizzou, which then-chancellor Brady Deaton called his \u201cproudest moment.\u201d But One Mizzou, as a concept and a name, was discontinued this summer at the behest of the students who it was supposed to benefit. A campaign that was initially supposed to promote tolerance and inclusion on campus had morphed into a generic marketing slogan for the school itself. The baby steps had led nowhere. \n \n The co-opting and eventual euthanizing of One Mizzou were emblematic of a simple fact that is as true in Columbia as it is in America: The University of Missouri, and the community in and around it, were aware of, and attentive to, the experiences of its minority students only in the worst of moments. When asked to confront and address the commonplace indignities minority students experience at his university during the homecoming parade\u2014a celebration, not a crisis\u2014Wolfe, the ostensible leader of that community, had no response. He will be gone, though not forgotten\u2014certainly not by his peers, who may now find themselves asked to acknowledge, and fix, problems they didn\u2019t know existed. \n \n [image via AP] ||||| (Via Jonathan Butler, on Facebook) \n \n UPDATE: The president of the University of Missouri said Monday morning that he would resign amid escalating protests. In response, Jonathan Butler announced that his hunger strike was officially over. \n \n This is only the first step! More change is to come!! #TheStruggleContinues #ConcernedStudent1950 \u2014 JB. (@_JonathanButler) November 9, 2015 \n \n Earlier: \n \n Jonathan Butler is in pain, but he has no intention of giving up. \n \n As of 9 a.m. Monday, it has been a week since the 25-year-old University of Missouri graduate student has eaten, a hunger strike he began in an effort to oust university president Tim Wolfe and bring about change to what he and other campus activists see as a school administration that has been unacceptably unresponsive to a series of racist incidents on campus. (Here\u2019s an interactive timeline of incidents on campus prepared by the MU student newspaper, the Maneater.) \n \n In a letter to the Board of Curators, the governing body to which the university president reports, Butler vowed that he would not eat until Wolfe was removed from office. \n \n \u201cI will not consume any food or nutritional sustenance at the expense of my health until either Tim Wolfe is removed from office or my internal organs fail and my life is lost,\u201d Butler wrote in a letter announcing his protest. \n \n Butler\u2019s act of protest, in concert with other activism coordinated by a group of students who called themselves Concerned Student 1950 \u2014 a nod to the year that black students were first admitted to the university \u2014 has seized the nation\u2019s attention. And, on Saturday night, members of Missouri\u2019s football team announced that they would join the protest, and would not practice or play until Butler\u2019s demands were met. \n \n [Missouri football players threaten to boycott season amid racial tension] \n \n The Board of Curators has called an emergency meeting for Monday morning to discuss the unrest. Meanwhile, the news media has flocked to the Columbia, Mo., campus, where more acts of protest and civil disobedience, including walkouts by graduate students and black faculty members, are planned. \n \n We spoke with Butler on Sunday night about his protest, his motivations, and the larger Black Lives Matter protest movement. Here is a Q&A edited for length and clarity. \n \n Tell me more about you personally. Where are you from, and what are you studying? \n \n Butler: I\u2019m 25 years old. I hail from Omaha, Nebraska, and I did my undergraduate studies at the University of Missouri, I got my bachelor\u2019s in business administration with an emphasis in marketing, and now I\u2019m pursuing my master\u2019s degree in educational leadership and policy. I enjoy school, skateboarding. You know, I enjoy life. \n \n And how did you end up in activism? What happened that leads you to find yourself one week into a hunger strike? \n \n Butler: I really look to the example of my grandfather and my mother, who were both raised in the church. And they did a lot of community engagement. And they used their talents, my mother both in education and my father having a law background, really to do advocacy for the community, and I think as a young child that\u2019s where it started. \n \n But when you talk about most recently on campus, in terms of protesting and mobilizing communities, that really came from my experience organizing during Ferguson, after the murder of Mike Brown. Because the University of Missouri is only two hours away from Ferguson, and being able to have that experience, I had never seen that many black people and I had never seen that many black people mobilized in that way. So, it really struck a chord with me, to really have a passion for inspiring and building up my black community. \n \n So what are you fighting for through this hunger strike? \n \n Butler: For me, I\u2019m fighting for justice. It\u2019s really plain and simple. \n \n When you localize it to the hunger strike it really is about the environment that is on campus. We have reactionary, negligent individuals on all levels at the university level on our campus and at the university system level, and so their job descriptions explicitly say that they\u2019re supposed to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all students \u2026 but when we have issues of sexual assault, when we have issues of racism, when we have issues of homophobia, the campus climate continues to deteriorate because we don\u2019t have strong leadership, willing to actually make change. So, for me, I\u2019m fighting for a better tomorrow. As much as the experiences on campus have not been that great for me \u2014 I had people call me the n-word, I had someone write the n-word on the a door in my residence hall \u2014 for me it really is about a call for justice. I\u2019m fighting for the black community on campus, because justice is worth fighting for. And justice is worth starving for. \n \n It\u2019s been a week since you ate. How are you feeling? Are you planning on stopping? \n \n Butler: No one really understands what my body is going through. My body is literally shutting down. I definitely have pain all over, shortness of breath. I\u2019m overheated one minute and then I\u2019m shivering the next, so there is just a lot that my body is going through right now. But I don\u2019t really try to focus on that, I\u2019m trying to focus on the fact that I really am encouraged by the activism that\u2019s going on. There are a lot of white allies that are coming on board, there is a lot of education, people are talking about this in classrooms. \n \n In a statement he issued on Sunday, President Wolfe made it clear that he doesn\u2019t intended to resign. What is your response to that? \n \n Butler: I\u2019m completely fine with that because my request last Monday was for the curators to step in. We\u2019ve gotten to the point where we\u2019ve addressed Tim Wolfe, and he\u2019s shown time and time again that he\u2019s not sincere about helping students. So, to me, that means it\u2019s time for new leadership, it\u2019s time for someone who can help the university be financially stable but also make sure that we are an amazing experience for students of all identities. \n \n This protest gained an increased level of attention over the weekend when members of the football team said they would boycott their games and practices until your hunger strike was over. Did you know they were going to join you in protest? \n \n Butler: I had no clue this was going to happen. One hundred percent of the support I\u2019ve received has been unexpected, but it has been a 1,000 percent appreciated. I just received a call over the weekend that some of the football players had heard about what was going on and they really felt passionate about it because they felt that they are all too often separated and put into this athletic bubble away from the rest of our community, and they really wanted to reach out and bridge that gap. And so for me it was a blessing. It was really heartwarming and encouraging really because I didn\u2019t think that I had people in my corner in the beginning. \n \n Do you see your activism as part of the Black Lives Matter movement? \n \n Butler: It is, but it\u2019s not. The Black Lives Matter movement, in terms of what that means and the symbolism of reaffirming black existence, black humanity, and so in that realm with what we\u2019re doing with our education sessions, what we\u2019re doing with our rallies, what we\u2019re doing on campus is definitely bringing about this awareness that we deserve to exist in these spaces on campus and we deserve to have our lives valued. And so in that sense, it\u2019s a part of the Black Lives Matter movement. But in another sense, this is really unique to campus just because of the example that we got from some of those who were organizing in Ferguson. There are three queer black women, who used their knowledge from Ferguson organizing in creating an organization called MU for Mike Brown. And from that, that\u2019s really where a lot of what has been going on on campus has been morphed from. So, it is part of the Black Lives Matter movement, but not necessarily in the cookie cutter way. \n \n A lot of people who otherwise wouldn\u2019t pay attention to this type of protest now are because of the solidarity you received from the football team. For those who are just tuning into this story, what do you want them to know? \n \n Butler: The campus climate here at the University of Missouri is an ugly one, it\u2019s one that often we don\u2019t talk about and it\u2019s one that, when issues come up, whether it\u2019s sexual assault, whether it\u2019s Planned Parenthood, whether it\u2019s racism, it gets swept under the rug because we want to rest on our traditions and rest on all these values that we hold in high esteem. And I think the message is that underneath all of that there is a lot of dirt and there\u2019s a lot of pain and there\u2019s a lot of hurt. There\u2019s things that need to be changed. And at the end of it all, even if you don\u2019t really understand what I\u2019m saying, even if you can\u2019t really understand systemic oppression and systemic racism, is the fact we can\u2019t be at a university where we have values like \u201cRespect, Responsibility, Discovery and Excellence\u201d and we don\u2019t have any of those things being enacted on campus, especially in terms of respect. I\u2019m on a campus where people feel free to call people the n-word, where people feel free as recently as last week, to used [their] own feces to smear a swastika in a residential hall. Everything that glitters is not gold. We really need to dig deep and be real with ourselves about the world we live in and understand that we\u2019re not perfect but understand that just because we\u2019re not perfect doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t start to understand and address the issues around us. \n \n Related: \n \n Black grad student on hunger strike in Mo. after swastika drawn with human feces \n \n Missouri football players threaten to boycott season amid racial tension \n \n With $1 million at stake, U. of Missouri\u2019s president now taking protests seriously \n \n This post has been updated.",

    "document": "A girl lights a candle in memory of the victims of Wednesday's attack on a vocational college in Kerch, Crimea, at the memorial stone with the word Kerch in the Alexander Garden near the Kremlin, Moscow,... (Associated Press) \n \n A girl lights a candle in memory of the victims of Wednesday's attack on a vocational college in Kerch, Crimea, at the memorial stone with the word Kerch in the Alexander Garden near the Kremlin, Moscow, Russia, Thursday, Oct. 18, 2018. A top official in Crimea says authorities are searching for a possible... (Associated Press) \n \n MOSCOW (AP) \u2014 While Crimean authorities searched for clues that might help explain why a teenager gunned down 20 people at his vocational school before killing himself, the stunned city of Kerch prepared to say farewell to the victims. \n \n Thousands of residents were expected to attend the funerals of most of the victims Friday. The burials are taking place in mainland Russia, which annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. \n \n Little information has emerged about the 18-year-old gunman, Vladislav Roslyakov. Authorities said they were investigating if he had an accomplice in Wednesday's shotgun massacre at Kerch Polytechnic College. \n \n Teachers and classmates have described him as a shy person with few friends. A computer taken from the home where Roslyakov lived with his parents revealed little, a Crimean official said Thursday. \n \n \"When they did a search and saw the computer, all information, messages and such had been deleted,\" Crimean human rights ombudswoman Lyudmila Lubina was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Tass. \n \n Roslyakov was initially described as the only person involved in the carnage at the school. But Sergei Aksyonov, the Kremlin-appointed head of Crimea, told Russian news agencies Thursday it's still possible the student had help. \n \n \"The point is to find out who was coaching him for this crime,\" Aksyonov said. \"He was acting on his own here, we know that. But this scoundrel could not have prepared this attack on his own, in my opinion, and according to my colleagues.\" \n \n Residents brought flowers and toys to a makeshift memorial outside the school on Thursday morning. Many were in tears, struggling to speak. \n \n The Kerch attack was by far the deadliest carried out by a student in Russia, raising questions about school security. The vocational school had a front desk, but no security guards. Russia's National Guard said Thursday it has now deployed officers and riot police to all schools and colleges in Kerch. \n \n Wednesday's violence also was the deadliest school attack in Russia since the 2004 Beslan attack by Chechen separatists, which left 333 people dead, many of them children, during a three-day siege. Hundreds of others were wounded. \n \n As the day wore on Thursday, neither Russian investigators nor other authorities followed up on Aksyonov's comments hinting at a wider attack plot. President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, portrayed the mass shooting in Kerch as a \"result of globalization\" \u2014 forces that were exporting bad practices into Russia. \n \n Speaking at an international policy conference, Putin compared Roslyakov's assault to the numerous school shootings in the United States. In the past few years, authorities have said several school attacks in Russia allegedly were inspired by gun violence in the U.S. \n \n Putin said that in his view, teenagers getting guns and going on shooting rampages meant adults had failed to offer them alternatives to violence. \n \n \"Young people with a fragile mental state are creating false heroes for themselves,\" he said. \"That means that all of us, not only in Russia, but in the world on the whole, are reacting poorly to the fast-changing realities.\" \n \n Russia has fairly strict gun legislation. Civilians can own only hunting rifles and smoothbore shotguns and must undergo significant background checks. Roslyakov had only recently received a permit to own a shotgun and had bought 150 cartridges just a few days ago, according to local officials. \n \n Asked about possible plans to further restrict gun ownership in Russia, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the government would wait for the results of the Kerch investigation. \n \n Since Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, Russian authorities repeatedly warned of a terrorism threat from unnamed Ukrainian nationalists and ethnic Tatars, an indigenous Crimean people. But despite acts of public defiance and rallies, both groups haven't engaged in any violent activities in Crimea. \n \n The death toll in Kerch, excluding Roslyakov, climbed Thursday to 20 after one of the wounded died in a hospital, according to Russian news agency Tass. \n \n Dozens of people remained hospitalized in Kerch, and at least 10 with severe injuries were being airlifted to top Russian hospitals for surgery, Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said. \n \n Most victims died from gunshot wounds, authorities said.

But alongside photographs of the shooters in both incidents, wearing strikingly similar outfits, RT points out that the perpetrators of both attacks were the same age, hit their school cafeterias with explosive devices, killed their classmates and finally committed suicide in their school libraries. \n \n Medical workers treat injured people outside the college building in Kerch, Crimea. \n \n In other media, the blame for the Kerch attack was more directly focused. \n \n Read More ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Shocked mourners gathered at a makeshift shrine at the college \n \n The deadly gun and bomb attack on a college in Crimea \"appears to be a result of globalisation\", Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. \n \n \"On social media, on the internet, we see the creation of entire communities. Everything started with the tragic events in schools in the US,\" he said. \n \n Fifteen students and five teachers were killed in Wednesday's attack on the technical college in Kerch. \n \n Officials named the killer as Vladislav Roslyakov, 18, who took his own life. \n \n He was a fourth-year student at the college in the city in Crimea - the southern peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014. \n \n 'People have lost limbs' \n \n On Wednesday, a huge nail-bomb blast ripped through the college's cafeteria, before the killer stormed through the building, shooting people at close range with a pump-action hunting rifle. \n \n Russian Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said the explosion from a home-made device had showered people with shrapnel. \n \n \"Some victims' internal organs were ruptured, we're finding washers and ballbearings in their livers, intestines, blood vessels,\" she said. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Emergency crews respond to the attack \n \n \"Limbs have been amputated - people have lost feet and shins,\" she said. \n \n Some of the critically injured were being transferred to hospitals as far away as Moscow. \n \n The authorities in Crimea have declared three days of mourning.

Minutes earlier he had left a rucksack containing the nail-bomb in the cafeteria on the ground floor and detonated it remotely, Russian Channel One TV reported. \n \n Photos later emerged in Russian media purportedly showing his body in the college library. \n \n The TV report described a scene of devastation and mass panic after the blast. It said doors and windows were shattered in the entrance hall and on the first floor, above the cafeteria. Some students leapt out of the building from a height of 5m (16ft 5in). \n \n Investigators later said they had found a second explosive device among the gunman's possessions and that it had been disarmed. He was also reported to have several packs of bullets and home-made petrol bombs. \n \n BBC Russian spoke to witnesses, including Igor Zakharevsky. \"I was at the epicentre of the first explosion, at the entrance, near the buffet,\" he said. \n \n \"I was in complete shock and one of my classmates started pulling me away. Then I heard several shots at intervals of two or three seconds. After a while there was another explosion.\" \n \n Marina, an 18-year-old student at the college, said there was \"a massive explosion, the windows began to rattle and everyone started screaming\". \n \n \"We bolted out of the classroom and ran. There was complete pandemonium in the corridor,\" she said. \"I saw a girl lying near the wall in an unnatural position, others lying on the floor covered in blood.

But should it come as such a surprise? \n \n There have been five attacks in schools in Russia this year where a number of children were injured. \n \n In Kerch, questions are already being asked: how did Vladislav Roslyakov manage to obtain a licence for a hunting weapon? And how was he able to launch such a deadly attack on his college? \n \n What do we know about the alleged gunman? \n \n His precise motives remain unclear. But there are suggestions the fourth-year student had developed a hostile attitude to the college. \n \n Russia's RBC TV interviewed a friend who said Roslyakov \"hated the technical school very much\" and had vowed \"revenge\" on his teachers. \n \n Image copyright PA Image caption Russian soldiers were deployed outside the school \n \n It has emerged that he obtained a gun licence when he was 17.

Little information has emerged about the 18-year-old gunman, Vladislav Roslyakov. Authorities said they were investigating if he had an accomplice in Wednesday's shotgun massacre at Kerch Polytechnic College. Teachers and classmates have described him as a shy person with few friends.

Roslyakov was initially described as the only person involved in the carnage at the school. But Sergei Aksyonov, the Kremlin-appointed head of Crimea, told Russian news agencies Thursday it's still possible the student had help. \"The point is to find out who was coaching him for this crime,\" Aksyonov said. \"He was acting on his own here, we know that.

(Associated Press) \n \n Rodman dedicated the game to his \"best friend\" Kim, who along with his wife and other senior officials and their wives watched from a special seating area. The capacity crowd of about 14,000 at the Pyongyang Indoor Stadium clapped loudly as Rodman sang a verse from the birthday song. \n \n Along with Rodman, the former NBA players included ex-All Stars Kenny Anderson, Cliff Robinson and Vin Baker. Also on the roster were Craig Hodges, Doug Christie, Charles D. Smith and four streetballers. \n \n Rodman said he was honored to be able to play the game in the North Korean capital, and called the event \"historic.\" To keep it friendly, the Americans played against the North Koreans in the first half, but split up and merged teams for the second half. \n \n The game is a new milestone in Rodman's unusual relationship with Kim, who rarely meets with foreigners and remains a mystery to much of the outside world. Kim, who inherited power after the death of his father in late 2011, is believed to be in his early thirties, but his age has not been officially confirmed. Until recently, his birthday was also not widely known \u2014 though it was quietly observed elsewhere around the capital Wednesday. \n \n Members of Rodman's team, who average in their late 40s, said they came because they believed the game would be a good opportunity to create a human connection with the people of the isolated country. But some said they have been concerned by the negative reaction they have seen from the media and critics back home. \n \n \"This was a test of faith. We stepped out into the unknown,\" said former New York Knicks player Charles D. Smith, who has played similar games in other countries and has acted as the team's spokesman to balance Rodman's famously outspoken character. \n \n Smith said he was gratified to see the North Korean crowd enjoy the game, but he added that he had mixed emotions about the two-hour event. \n \n \"Emotionally, I don't know what to feel,\" he told The Associated Press afterward. \"I'm indifferent. I'm not totally overjoyed.\" \n \n Smith said he and the other players did not join Rodman in singing the birthday song. \n \n \"We always tell Dennis that he can't sing. He is tone deaf,\" Smith said. \"He did it alone.\" \n \n Rodman is the highest-profile American to meet Kim. He has carefully avoided getting involved in overtly political activities, saying that he is not a statesman and instead is seeking only to build cultural connections with the North through basketball that may help improve relations between Pyongyang and Washington. \n \n That has not stopped many in the United States \u2014 including members of Congress, the NBA and human rights groups \u2014 from calling his visits to North Korea ill-advised and naive. \n \n In particular, Rodman has been slammed for not using his influence with Kim to help free Kenneth Bae, an American missionary in poor health who is being confined in the North for \"anti-state\" crimes. ||||| SEOUL Former U.S. basketball star Dennis Rodman led an auditorium of North Koreans in singing \"Happy Birthday\" to their leader on Wednesday, a day after he sparked controversy by appearing to suggest a Korean-American was to blame for his captivity in North Korea. \n \n Rodman brought a team of fellow former National Basketball Association stars to the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, to mark the birthday of leader Kim Jong Un with an exhibition game. The birthday is believed to have been on Wednesday though that has not been confirmed. \n \n \"It started out as surreal, then people joined in and it sort of faded a bit, but it seemed pretty heartfelt from Rodman's side,\" Simon Cockerell, a tour guide who watched the game in Pyongyang, said of Rodman's birthday singing. \n \n \"It was unexpected, and probably unplanned,\" he said. \"Kim Jong Un appeared to smile, but he didn't appear to expect it.\" \n \n Cockerell, whose company Koryo Tours took a group of tourists to the game, said the audience had stood and cheered Kim for up to six minutes when he appeared with his wife. \n \n \"Dennis Rodman gave a charmingly shambolic speech where he thanked Kim Jong Un and his wife for showing up, along with the other players for being brave enough to come with him and join in his 'engagement effort'.\" \n \n This was Rodman's fourth trip to Pyongyang. On previous visits he spent time dining as a guest of Kim, with whom he says he has a genuine friendship. \n \n The visit come weeks after the execution of Kim's uncle, Jang Song Thaek, who until then was one of the most powerful figures. South Korean President Park Geun-hye has described events in North Korea as a \"reign of terror\". \n \n Rodman has said he would not interfere in North Korea's politics but he raised an outcry at home when, in a television interview on Tuesday, he appeared to suggest that Korean-American missionary Kenneth Bae was to blame for his captivity. \n \n During an interview with CNN about his trip, Rodman seemed to say Bae, held in North Korea since November 2012 and convicted in May on charges of crimes against the state, was responsible for his situation. \n \n \"If you understand what Kenneth Bae did ... Do you understand what he did in this country? Why is he held captive in this country?\" Rodman said, declining to respond to questions to clarify what he meant. \n \n Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, a periodic troubleshooter on North Korean issues, told CNN on Wednesday Rodman's comments were damaging and said North Koreans were clearly using him to get a message to the United States. \n \n \"I think what's most reprehensible is his implication that Kenneth Bae, an American detained on very spurious charges who deserves to come home, might be guilty,\" said Richardson, who was U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the 1990s. \n \n \"Obviously, Rodman was briefed by the North Koreans. They see him as their link to the United States because they don't want to talk to us,\" he said. \n \n Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said her family was outraged by Rodman's comments and he could do a lot of good by using his access to the North Korea leader to advocate on Bae's behalf, rather than \"hurl outrageous accusations\" at her brother. \n \n \"He is playing games with my brother's life,\" Chung said in a statement. \"There is no diplomacy, only games, and at my brother's expense.\" \n \n \"He is clearly uninformed about Kenneth's case, and he is certainly not in any position to pass judgment,\" Chung said, adding that Bae never had hostile intentions against the state. \n \n BAE \"AILING\" \n \n Asked about Rodman's comments, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters: \"I'm not going to dignify that outburst with a response,\" emphasizing that the trip was private travel not endorsed by the U.S. government. \n \n \"I'm simply going to say that we remain gravely concerned about Kenneth Bae's health, and continue to urge DPRK authorities to grant his amnesty and immediate release on humanitarian grounds,\" Carney said. \n \n Bae, 45, was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for state subversion in North Korea. He was detained in 2012 as he led a tour group through the north of the country. North Korea's Supreme Court said he used his tourism business to form groups aimed at overthrowing the government. \n \n Following a visit to her son in October, Bae's mother, Myunghee Bae, said her son was \"alone and ailing\". \n \n A devout Christian, Bae has acknowledged he conducted religious services in North Korea, which has long been hostile to Westerners advocating religious causes. \n \n U.S. Representative Eliot Engel, the leading Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, criticized Rodman and the other Americans for what he called an ill-advised trip. \n \n \"As North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un continues to starve and oppress his citizens, it is unthinkable that a few fading celebrities would use such an opportunity to reward his brutal regime,\" he said. \n \n (Reporting by James Pearson in Seoul, Doina Chiacu, Roberta Rampton, Patricia Zengerle in Washington, Eric Johnson in Seattle; Editing by Clarence Fernandez and Stephen Powell)",

No further statement is expected at this time. \n \n Crowley and Manziel spent time earlier that evening with a group of friends at the Zaza Hotel in Dallas, according to police. After the friends dispersed for the evening, Manziel and Crowley were left alone at the hotel, the report says. \n \n Crowley told police that is when Manziel began to become aggressive toward her. Crowley was adamant to police that Manziel was not intoxicated. She told police that Manziel struck her left ear. \n \n The police report stated that Crowley described the incident at the hotel in vague terms. \n \n Crowley and Manziel then proceeded toward the exit of the hotel and Manziel told her that he was going to drive her home because he did not want her to drive while intoxicated. Crowley told police that Manziel appeared as if he were \u201con some kind of drugs.\u201d \n \n Crowley said that Manziel drove her in her vehicle toward Fort Worth, where she resides. During the drive, Manziel shouted angrily and struck her several times. \n \n The report states that Crowley \u201cagain was somewhat vague on the details of the assault.\u201d \n \n Crowley became irritated with further questioning by officers at her apartment. Crowley did not report an assault at her apartment, and she told officers that \u201cshe was running in and out of her apartment through the front door in an attempt to get away from Jonathan.\u201d \n \n She told officers that she \u201cfinally rushed out of the apartment and ran to a nearby neighbor\u2019s door to seek help.\u201d Manziel then fled the area on foot, the report said. \n \n As the police investigation continued, Crowley became \u201cincreasingly uncooperative,\" stating that she did not want to answer any more questions or fill out a statement or make a report. \n \n Officers notified Air One to conduct a fly over search of the area in an attempt to locate Manziel. \n \n A Fort Worth police officer attempted to call Manziel on his cell phone but the call was not answered. Officers were unable to locate Manziel after searching the area. \n \n Because the location of the alleged assault was in another city\u2019s jurisdiction, in addition to Crowley\u2019s apprehensiveness about making a report, police said an \u201cinformation only\u201d report was completed. \n \n This was the latest incident involving Manziel, who was also pulled over by police in Ohio in October after an altercation with Crowley while driving on an interstate.

After the incident was initially reported last weekend, the Browns issued a statement indicating they are likely to part ways with Manziel in coming months.

Crowley told police she tried to leave the room, but that Manziel wouldn't let her. \n \n Crowley told police Manziel \"restrained\" in some manner and \"led\" her down a back stairway to the valet area. \n \n \"I was crying and begged the valet, 'Please don't let him take me. I'm scared for my life!'\" she told police. The valet reportedly told her, \"I don't know what to do\" and let Manziel leave with her. \n \n Sources say Manziel then drove her about a half-mile to her car, which was parked near the Concrete Cowboy bar off Cedar Springs Road. She claims she jumped out of the car and tried to hide from Manziel, but he found her in some nearby bushes. \n \n \"He grabbed me by my hair and threw me back into the car and got back in himself,\" she reportedly told police. \"He hit me with his open hand on my left ear for jumping out of the car. I realized immediately that I could not hear out of that ear, and I still cannot today, two days later.\" \n \n Crowley then reportedly hit Manziel several times, hoping to get out of the car, but, she told police, Manziel \"threw me off of him\" and she hit her head on the car window. She told police he would not give her her phone. \n \n Sources say Manziel then got on Interstate 30 and began driving to her apartment in Fort Worth. While en route, she claims, she yelled at him, \"I hate you!\" He allegedly replied that \"he was going to drop me off, take my car and go kill himself,\" sources said. \n \n She says she thought he was on drugs or maybe having a psychotic break.

Investigative efforts to date have not resulted in the filing of a criminal complaint and the incident is determined to be closed. No further statement is expected at this time. \n \n Manziel burst onto the national sports scene in 2012 while a freshman at Texas A&M University. That season, he led the Aggies to 11 wins, including a victory over top-ranked Alabama. \n \n The win over the Crimson Tide and his dazzling play in college football\u2019s toughest conference positioned Manziel to become the first ever freshman to win the Heisman Trophy. \n \n He left Texas A&M after his sophomore season and entered the NFL draft. Manziel\u2019s past legal problems and concerns over his size led NFL executives to question whether he could compete at the professional level. \n \n Manziel wasn\u2019t taken until the 22nd overall pick by the Cleveland Browns.

    "document": "Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n BERLIN \u2014 Germany on Friday failed to persuade Hungary and three other Central European partners to accept joint European Union action and a quota to distribute migrants from the Middle East. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, using blunt language that indicated Berlin might be losing patience, called the crisis \u201cthe greatest challenge the European Union has faced in its history.\u201d \n \n Up to 40,000 people might arrive this weekend, he said \u2014 double the total warmly welcomed in an outpouring of emotion last Saturday and Sunday. The new figures came as questions mounted about the wisdom of throwing open the borders last weekend, in a humanitarian gesture that was described as a one-time exception, but which appears to have encouraged more asylum-seekers to join the migrant trail. \n \n In an indication that the government was troubled about maintaining control, Ursula von der Leyen, Germany\u2019s defense minister, announced that 4,000 troops were on standby \u2014 a measure more often used to preserve order in natural disasters. \n \n Continue reading the main story Video \n \n Mr. Steinmeier stressed that Germany now expects 800,000 migrants to arrive this year, and added, \u201cNone of these will be taken in by others, so I ask for understanding, that we discuss not only those who are already here, but a fair quota of distribution of those who are still on the way.\u201d \n \n His statement during talks in Prague with Hungarian, Czech, Slovak and Polish counterparts suggested that neither he nor the foreign minister of Luxembourg, which holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union, had persuaded the former Communist countries, which have not been immigrant destinations, to adopt quotas to house 160,000 migrants as suggested this week by the European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker. \n \n The Prague talks were held in anticipation of a meeting on Monday of European interior ministers to discuss the Juncker proposals, and there were indications on Friday that heads of state and government might have to hold a summit meeting if no progress is made then. Officials in Berlin, speaking on condition of anonymity as they groped for a solution, even mentioned using majority voting \u2014 and not the traditional consensus \u2014 to decide the matter. \n \n That would be highly unusual in an affair so central to Europe\u2019s destiny. \n \n But Mr. Steinmeier indicated that Berlin is keenly aware that failure to control the situation might tip the popular mood in Germany, and other countries like Sweden and Austria, where the welcome for the migrants has so far been mostly warm. \n \n While Social Democrats like Mr. Steinmeier have long supported immigration, the conservatives in Bavaria\u2019s Christian Social Union, Ms. Merkel\u2019s partners in her center-right bloc, have long been critical, and have grown more so this week. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost control,\u201d said Hans-Peter Friedrich, a former interior minister and deputy leader of the Bavarian party, in the newspaper Passauer Neue Presse. \n \n Throwing open the borders to migrants coming from Hungary by way of Austria last weekend \u201cwas a failure that we will have to deal with for a long time,\u201d said Horst Seehofer, head of the Bavarian party and governor of that state. \u201cI don\u2019t see how we will put the cork back in the bottle,\u201d he was quoted as telling Der Spiegel magazine. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Steinmeier said Europe needed a common message, that \u201cnot everyone who arrives has the right to asylum, or the right to a job.\u201d Smugglers, he said, spread such rumors \u201cand are working on purpose to lure people into undertaking dangerous journeys.\u201d \n \n The harsh response to migrants in some countries in Eastern and Central Europe has spurred debate about why many in former Communist countries, which themselves spent four decades craving liberty, are in some cases unsympathetic, and even downright hostile, to those fleeing war and tyranny. \n \n Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary reiterated his criticism of migrants on Friday, and he warned that his country would soon take an even harder line. \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cThey have seized railway stations, refused to give fingerprints, failed to cooperate and are unwilling to go to places where they would get food, water, accommodation and medical care,\u201d Mr. Orban said after a meeting with Manfred Weber, chairman of the conservative European People\u2019s Party in the European Parliament. \n \n Tougher laws on immigration go into effect Tuesday, Mr. Orban said, and migrants who cross the border illegally will be arrested. \n \n At the meeting in Prague, some countries repeated that immigration policy was a matter of national sovereignty. Lubomir Zaoralek, the Czech foreign minister, said, \u201cEvery country has to have the sovereign right to decide who it will or will not accept.\u201d \n \n Mr. Steinmeier took issue. \u201cWe can, as Europe, say that we will shut all borders, and not let anyone else in,\u201d he said. But in doing so, \u201cwe would betray our values.\u201d \n \n The United Nations on Friday gave qualified support to the Juncker plan. It \u201cwould go a long way\u201d toward addressing the crisis, William Spindler, a spokesman for the United Nations refugee agency, told reporters in Geneva, but he added that it was still insufficient. \n \n Continue reading the main story European Refugee and Migrant Crisis \n \n \u201cOur estimates indicate even higher needs,\u201d Mr. Spindle said, \u201cbut the focus must now be on ensuring all member states take part in this initiative, and that it is swiftly implemented.\u201d \n \n Elsewhere on Friday, the Austrian railway said there would also be no regional traffic between Austria and Hungary this weekend, after Austria stopped rail service across the border with Hungary under the pressure of migrants streaming in. \n \n That prompted several groups of migrants who had arrived from Hungary to start marching toward Vienna along various routes, according to Helmut Marban, a spokesman for the police in the eastern Austrian province of Burgenland. \n \n The main highway in the direction of Vienna was closed at least for some hours on Friday because of the danger of migrants marching along the road. \n \n The Geneva-based International Organization for Migration said that in Geneva, a record 432,761 migrants had crossed the Mediterranean already this year, compared with 197,940 people crossing in all of 2014, Reuters reported. \n \n The situation also continued to deteriorate in Macedonia, where the authorities are scrambling to find ways to cope with an increase in the number of migrants traveling through the country. \n \n More than 11,000 migrants entered the country in a 24-hour period that ended Friday, according to the United Nations refugee agency, and the number was expected to remain similarly high over the next few days. \n \n Despite the challenges facing the country, a proposal on Thursday by Nikola Poposki, Macedonia\u2019s minister of foreign affairs, to follow Hungary\u2019s example of building a fence along its border was met with harsh criticism from domestic civil organizations and political parties. ||||| \"As I watch the footage now, it's like I'm not watching myself. I honestly regret what I have done and take responsibility for it,\" wrote Petra Laszlo in a letter to Hungarian newspaper Magyar Nemzet published on its website. \n \n In the footage, which spread rapidly across the Internet earlier this week, Laszlo, 40, can be seen tripping a man sprinting with a child in his arms, and kicking another running child near the town of Roszke, close to the border with Serbia. \n \n She was fired from her job at N1TV, an Internet-based television station close to Hungary's far-right Jobbik party, and also faces criminal charges for breaching the peace. \n \n Photo: Getty Images \n \n She was detained for questioning by police on Thursday and later released. \n \n \"Only now could I get myself together enough to be able to write.

The tiny fish found only... (Associated Press) \n \n The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Tuesday that it was proposing that the Oregon chub was recovered, 21 years after it went on the endangered species list. The proposal will go through a 60-day public comment period before becoming final. The agency will monitor the fish for nine years to make sure populations continue to grow. \n \n \"We're not saying it won't need management,\" Paul Henson, Oregon director of Fish and Wildlife, said in an interview. \"But they can leave the hospital and get out to be an outpatient.\" \n \n Robyn Thorson, northwest regional director of Fish and Wildlife, made the announcement at a 92-acre property along the McKenzie River outside Springfield. The property is owned by the McKenzie River Trust that combines a working farm with habitat protection and restoration. \n \n The fish had practically disappeared from Oregon's Willamette Valley as the swampy backwaters and beaver ponds it depends on were drained to control flooding and create farms and cities over the past century and a half. Those that survived the habitat loss became easy prey for bass introduced from the East. \n \n Unlike Pacific salmon, the Oregon chub was relatively easy to save because it inhabits small places and does not get in the way of huge economic forces, such as logging, hydroelectric power and farming, said Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife biologist Brian Bangs, who since 2005 has supervised recovery efforts. \n \n Joe Moll, executive director of the McKenzie River Trust, said the chub's obscurity made it easier to find solutions because there were none of the high stakes and big egos involved in charismatic species like wolves, grizzly bears and salmon. \n \n \"We are better able to look at something that you can put in the hand of a little kid, and just reflects joy with the natural world,\" he said. \"The recovery of the Oregon chub is a sign the river is still alive. It still has the processes that things like chub and chinook salmon juveniles evolved with.\" \n \n The Oregon chub is a small minnow, typically about 3 inches long, with an olive-green back, silvery sides and large scales. \n \n They were not described scientifically until the early 1900s, when a researcher found some outside Portland in the Clackamas River drainage, Bangs said. It was the 1970s before anyone really started paying attention. \n \n Before European settlement, the Willamette Valley was a complex system of braided river channels, oxbows and beaver ponds, where perhaps as many as 1 million Oregon chub lived, Bangs said. By 1992, there were only 1,000 fish known in eight locations. Today, there are 180,000 fish at 80 locations. The fish was upgraded to threatened in 2010. \n \n The recovery plan focused on establishing partnerships with landowners to restore key habitats, breeding and transplanting fish to those places, and getting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to alter dam releases to more closely resemble natural river flows. Private landowners who agreed to have chubs introduced on their property and to follow some guidelines were given safe harbor agreements guaranteeing the presence of the endangered fish would not interfere with their use of the land. \n \n \"We managed to figure out a way to provide for the habitat of the chub in some subset of its range in the Willamette Valley in a way that was economically compatible with landowners, agriculture and other commodity-type development,\" said Henson of Fish and Wildlife. \"Twenty years might seem like a long time (to get it off the endangered list). On the other hand, if you think of the 150 years of habitat modification that went on before, it is pretty darn quick.\" \n \n Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber issued statements crediting partnerships between agencies and private landowners for the chub's recovery. \n \n Along with chub, a variety of protected species moved into those restored habitats, including salmon, Western pond turtles and red-legged frogs, Bangs said.",

If you haven't seen it yet, go here . The trailer will also be in theaters tomorrow in front of, in 3D no less, and it's just cinematic enough that buying a ticket forjust to see it might not be a bad decision.It's such a good trailer that we immediately dove into it and brought you a series of 94 amazing still photos from the trailer, and now we're digging in even deeper to figure out just what this trailer told us about director Peter Jackson's plans for this return to Middle Earth. Here a few key things we learned from the trailer, that we didn't know before we watched it. Hobbit fans\u2026 add on to the list using the comments section below.We know that Peter Jackson's adaptation ofwill actually contain more than just. He's written a bunch of new material, not in the book, but based on ancillary Tolkien works to pair with it. That extra material will involve a side quest in which Gandalf, Galadriel, and other great powers go to confront a dark and rising power in Mirkwood. What we didn't know until this trailer is whether that extra material would be confined to the second movie of the two being released, allowing them to focus on simply telling the story ofhere, or if they'd somehow weave it in with the other things which are supposed to be happening. The trailer though makes it clear that we're getting it all at once. Galadriel appears numerous times in thetrailer, though she's not in the book version ofat all. She'll no doubt be one of the main characters in that new, side story, and here she is in the very first film.For anyone concerned that all the time that's passed or shooting in 3D might have changed the way Peter Jackson approaches Tolkien's material,should come as a relief. Middle Earth still looks like Middle Earth. Watching Bilbo walk through Hobbiton is like sitting back down with an old, familiar friend. It just feels right, everything is as it should be, right down to Bag End and Gandalf's beard. The inclusion of actors like Elijah Wood (in the trailer very briefly here ) and Ian Holm as the older Bilbo only helps that feeling along, this should feel very much like a place we know, and it does.One of the big concerns people had early on indevelopment process was the look of the dwarves. We started getting images like this one which made it seem as though Peter Jackson was trying to make dwarves sexy. Anyone who knows anything about dwarf men, knows they aren't sexy. The truth is that only about half of the dwarf characters that showed up in the photos they released actually looked liked a dwarf at all. Luckily, it all seems to work perfectly in context. In the trailer they look like dwarves . Thorin Oakenshield looks like a particularly heroic dwarf , and he's maybe even kind of good looking as dwarf dudes go, but still a dwarf. A lot of that is perhaps because of their behavior. A dwarf just doesn't act like other people, they're gruff, they hid behind their beards, they stand up in the middle of a meal and sing a haunting song about their longed for home. All of that happens intrailer and you get the sense that while these are very different dwarf characters from the one John Rhys Davies played in thefilms, they are definitely dwarves nonetheless.A few months ago here on Cinema Blend we talked about some of the big story problems Peter Jackson and his team would have to solve in order to turn Tolkien's book into a movie. One of the biggest on our list at the time was the problem of Gollum's cave. It's one of the most pivotal scenes in, and it takes place in total darkness. It's so dark in fact that Bilbo can't see anything, and his overall blindness is part of the scene. We get a glimpse of that scene at the end of thetrailer and it seems clear that they've solved it simply by making it not that dark (screenshot here ). It's not entirely clear how much Bilbo can or can't see in that brief footage, but the audience can see everything. I suppose that's particularly important since the movie's in 3D and 3D can't cope at all with dark images, but I still find myself wishing for the inky, impenetrable depths described in Tolkien's book.All of J.R.R. Tolkien's books actually devote a great many pages to song lyrics, which the characters sing as they travel. It's pretty hard to work those into a feature film, thoughdid it once or twice, albeit a little awkwardly. The first trailer forthough works in the Tolkien-style music right off the bat, suggesting that it'll play a more prominent role in. The song the Dwarves sing in the trailer is called \u201cMisty Mountains\u201d and it's about the place they're going. These are the song's full lyrics: ||||| The first trailer for the first of Peter Jackson\u2019s two-part film adaptation of The Hobbit , subtitled An Unexpected Journey , is out.

    "document": "WASHINGTON -- Justice Clarence Thomas stunned lawyers, reporters and others at the Supreme Court on Monday when he posed questions during an oral argument for the first time in 10 years. \n \n It was the second week the court has heard arguments since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, Thomas' friend and fellow conservative. Thomas for years sat directly to Scalia's right. Scalia's chair is now draped in black in a tribute to his death on Feb. 13. \n \n Thomas' questions came in case in which the court is considering placing new limits on the reach of a federal law that bans people convicted of domestic violence from owning guns. \n \n With about 10 minutes left in the hourlong session, Justice Department lawyer Ilana Eisenstein was about to sit down after answering a barrage of questions from other justices. Thomas then caught her by surprise, asking whether the violation of any other law \"suspends a constitutional right.\" \n \n Thomas's unusual silence over the years has become a curiosity over the years. Thomas has previously said he relies on the written briefs and doesn't need to ask questions of the lawyers appearing in court. \n \n Thomas last asked a question in court on Feb. 22, 2006. He has come under criticism for his silence from some who say he is neglecting his duties as a justice. The 10-year milestone of his courtroom silence came just days after Scalia's death. Thomas was one of only two people invited by Scalia's family to recite a prayer during the funeral Mass on Feb. 20. \n \n In 2013, Thomas did speak briefly in court, when he interrupted Scalia, inquiring about whether Ivy League lawyers had properly represented a client. \n \n The official court transcript only picked up four words of Thomas' remarks -- \"well he did not\" -- and according to CBS News' Jan Crawford, Thomas appeared to be suggesting that an Ivy League degree did not necessarily mean the lawyer was qualified. \n \n Thomas' public silence dates back to long before his days on the court. In his memoir, he wrote that he did not like speaking up in college because he was self-conscious about his unusual southern Georgia dialect. \n \n But in 2007, Thomas defended his choice to remain mum behind the bench on \"60 Minutes,\" telling Steve Kroft that his silence was not due to insecurity or fear. \n \n \"Justice Marshall rarely asked questions. Justice Powell rarely asked questions. That's a personal preference. I certainly wouldn't do it to provide histrionics for the media gallery or for other people or for critics,\" Justice Thomas insisted. \"Critics will always be critics,\" he added. \n \n Few reporters showed up Monday for arguments in the first case, in which the justices considered appeals from two Maine men who say their guilty pleas for hitting their partners should not disqualify them from gun ownership. The men say the law should only cover intentional acts of abuse and not those committed in the heat of an argument. \n \n During the first 45 minutes of the argument, most of the justices appeared to favor the government's position that even reckless acts of domestic assault fall under the law. Thomas did not pose questions to Virginia Villa, the lawyer arguing on behalf of the two men. \n \n But Thomas peppered Eisenstein with several questions about Second Amendment gun rights, a topic no other justice had asked about. He noted that the law allows someone convicted of a misdemeanor assault charge to get a lifetime ban on possessing a gun \"which at least as of now results in suspension of a constitutional right.\" \n \n \"The suspension is not directly related to the use of a weapon?\" Thomas asked. \n \n Eisenstein said he was correct, but that Congress passed the law to prevent people accused of domestic violence from later using weapons against a family member. She noted that violating other laws can in some cases limit a person's free speech rights. Thomas then asked how long the suspension of the right to own a firearm lasts. \n \n Eisenstein said it was indefinite. \n \n In one of the cases, Stephen Voisine pleaded guilty in 2003 to simple assault after slapping his girlfriend in the face while he was intoxicated. In 2009, an anonymous caller reported that Voisine had shot a bald eagle with a rifle. He was then convicted under the gun law. \n \n The other case involves William Armstrong III, who pleaded guilty to simple assault in 2002 after pushing his wife during an argument and leaving a \"red mark.\" Eight years later, police searching Armstrong's home discovered six firearms and ammunition. ||||| Clarence Thomas Breaks 10 Years of High Court Silence WASHINGTON (CN) - The death of Justice Antonin Scalia promises to change the way the Supreme Court operates in many potentially momentous ways, but Monday's arguments presented a more minor if equally noticeable shift on the nation's highest court. \n \n For the first time in 10 years, Justice Clarence Thomas asked a question from the bench. \n \n The query happened during remarks by Justice Department attorney Ilana Eisenstein in the case Voisine v. U.S., a challenge to the federal ban against firearm ownership by convicted domestic abusers. \n \n Having spent the last 15 minutes defending the ban against people convicted of \"reckless\" misdemeanor charges, Eisenstein asked whether there were any more questions, and Thomas unexpectedly raised his voice. \n \n \"Ms. Eisenstein, one question,\" Thomas said. \n \n There was an audible shift in the packed courtroom as the audience sat up in their chairs and members of the press scrambled for their notebooks and pens to capture what occasioned the conservative justice to break his 10-year streak not asking questions from the bench. \n \n \"Can you give me - this is a misdemeanor violation,\" Thomas said. \"It suspends a constitutional right. Can you give me another area where a misdemeanor violation suspends a constitutional right?\" \n \n Following up with nine more questions, Thomas pushed Eisenstein to come up with another scenario in which such a suspension would be warranted. \n \n Though Thomas has not asked a question from the bench since Feb. 22, 2006, his fellow justices seemed unfazed by the change Monday. All either looked ahead as usual or turned to look as Thomas rolled through his questions. \n \n He asked whether the government could shut down a publisher who was reckless in displaying children in compromising circumstances, suspending its First Amendment rights. \n \n Eisenstein prompted another question by saying there could be some measured restrictions on the publisher. \n \n \"So how is that different from suspending your Second Amendment right?\" he asked. \n \n The justice finally asked Eisenstein if the case would be better if the two petitioners had used guns in their acts of domestic violence, a point with which Eisenstein agreed. \n \n Congress enacted a law in 1996 that prevents people convicted on misdemeanor domestic violence charges from owning guns. \n \n In the case at hand, challengers Stephen Voisine and William Armstrong broke domestic-violence laws in Maine. \n \n While Voisine assaulted a girlfriend in 2004, Armstrong pleaded guilty for doing the same to his wife in 2008. Both were charged with \"intentionally, knowingly or recklessly caus[ing] bodily injury or offensive physical contact.\" \n \n Armstrong ran afoul of the federal law in 2010 when investigators found guns and ammunition in his house during a search in an unrelated drug case. He was soon charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by one previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. \n \n Voisine, on the other hand, can point to the rumor of a dead bald eagle for his case's day in the Supreme Court. In 2009, with investigators homed in on him after receiving an anonymous tip claiming he had shot a bald eagle, Voisine turned over a gun, triggering his violation of the federal law. \n \n Both men moved to dismiss their indictments, claiming the state-law assault and domestic-assault statutes were not enough to trigger the federal ban on owning guns. Federal judges denied the motions, and Voisine and Armstrong entered conditional pleas reserving the right to appeal their motions to dismiss. \n \n The two men claim \"reckless\" is not a high enough standard to qualify as battery. The common law definition of battery requires the violence in question to be intentional, Voisine and Armstrong contend, meaning reckless conduct should not be covered under the federal weapons restriction. \n \n Arguing for Voisine and Armstrong at the hearing Monday, Virginia Villa said the law considers intentionally offensive action, rather than the recklessness, because the statute contains the word \"use.\" \n \n Overall the justices did not seem to buy Villa's point. \n \n Justice Sonia Sotomayor pointed out that if a husband threw a bottle toward his wife, the bottle smashed against the wall and the pieces embedded themselves in her face, he would still be liable under domestic-violence statutes, even if he didn't mean to hit his wife with the bottle. \n \n \"Intentionality, in my mind, is misperceived, because you think - you're talking about intentionality as the act of causing the injury,\" Sotomayor said before delving into this hypothetical. \n \n Villa offered another example: this time of a person she represented who slammed a door while running from a person trying to beat him up. Just because the pursuer got his fingers caught in the door does not mean Villa's client battered him, because his intent was to close the door, not to hurt the person he was fleeing from, Villa said. \n \n But Justice Elena Kagan disagreed, arguing the act of slamming the door constituted a use of force. \n \n \"Doing something like driving a car 200 miles an hour, or throwing a plate, or slamming a door when somebody's hand is in the vicinity, all of those things involve the requisite risk and all of those things involve the use of physical force,\" Kagan said. \n \n Villa's argument took up the majority of the hearing, lasting about half an hour before she sat down. \n \n The justices allowed Eisenstein to speak uninterrupted for considerably longer than Villa, at least at the outset of her arguments. \n \n Eisenstein said that states \"overwhelmingly\" include recklessness in battery statutes. Limiting misdemeanor crimes to those involving intentional conduce, she said, would force prosecutors to prove an abuser intended to cause injury in order to apply the federal weapons ban. \n \n This prompted Chief Justice John Roberts to speak up. \n \n \"What's so bad about that?\" He asked. \"I mean, given her door example, for example, why would the accidental or perhaps you would say she - you know - he or she knew the person was close, why would that constitute misdemeanor crime of domestic violence?\" \n \n Eisenstein then contended Congress meant to cover recklessness in its weapons-ban law, even if it didn't explicitly do so. Dismissing Villa's door example, the attorney said it would be nothing more than negligence. \n \n Roberts then asked if a man who speeds through a stop sign could prosecuted under her definition of battery if his wife is injured in the resulting accident. Eisenstein argued such prosecution could be possible, but that it would be a very narrow circumstance. \n \n \"My argument is the opposite, which is that this court should effectuate Congress's purpose by giving [the federal weapons ban] the meaning that Congress intended, which is to cover generally applicable assault and battery statutes regardless of whether, on a rare instance, they may end up covering an individual who was recklessly driving and injured a family member,\" Eisenstein said. \n \n While this point caused some back and forth among the justices, Eisenstein summed up her argument by suggesting the government's interpretation of the law would primarily only effect people who committed clear domestic violence. \n \n \"In the face of petitioner's hypothetical's, petitioner struggles to even conceive of a hypothetical example of where there is a reckless battery that would - against a family member that would not constitute a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence,\" Eisenstein said. \n \n As is its custom, the court made a transcript of the groundbreaking hearing available this afternoon. ||||| (CNN) For the first time in a decade, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas spoke during oral arguments. \n \n Just last week, CNN wrote about the 10 years since Thomas' last question at oral arguments. That anniversary, February 22, came on the same day the Supreme Court first heard oral arguments after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, who was Thomas' ideological soul mate and who had defended his lack of questions over the years. \n \n \"No one was more ideologically aligned with Justice Scalia than Justice Thomas, who has historically been reluctant to ask questions at oral argument because he believes his colleagues already do more than enough talking,\" said CNN contributor Stephen I. Vladeck. \"That he's now asking questions -- for the first time in over a decade -- is as powerful evidence of the impact of Justice Scalia's absence as anything we've seen from the justices thus far,\" he said. \n \n The comments from Thomas were directed at a government attorney Ilana H. Eisenstein in a case called Voisine v. United States. The case concerns whether a prior domestic assault conviction based on reckless conduct qualifies as a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence that would block the plaintiffs from possessing a firearm. \n \n \"Everyone leaned in disbelieving,\" said Slate's Dahlia Lithwick, who was in the courtroom. \"The colloquy went back and forth several times with Thomas pressing the assistant solicitor general,\" Lithwick said. \n \n \"This is a misdemeanor violation,\" Thomas said at one point to Eisenstein. \"It suspends a constitutional right. Can you give me another area where a misdemeanor violation suspends a constitutional right?\" he asked. \n \n JUST WATCHED A 2014 report: Why is Justice Thomas 'supremely' silent?

MUST WATCH A 2014 report: Why is Justice Thomas 'supremely' silent? 06:39 \n \n Thomas has offered a variety of reasons for his silence from the bench. \n \n \"We have a lifetime to go back in chambers and to argue with each other,\" Thomas said in 2013, according to The Associated Press. He noted that the lawyers only have about 30 minutes to present their side of the case. \"They should argue. That's a part of the process.\" Thomas said and added that he doesn't like to \"badger people.\" \n \n Although Scalia and Thomas disagreed on some cases, they agreed on many and were close friends. Thomas was a lector at Scalia's funeral and released a statement after his death saying, \"It is hard to imagine the court without my friend. I will miss him beyond all measure.\" \n \n Thomas spoke at Scalia's funer on February 20. \n \n The two men had radically different styles from the bench, however. Scalia often peppered advocates with questions while Thomas silently listened. \n \n Scalia defended his colleague's silence, and asked enough questions for the both of them. \n \n In 2012, he told CNN's Piers Morgan that when he was a young lawyer he appeared before the justices as an advocate and was only asked two questions. \n \n \"It was not at all unusual for justices not to ask questions,\" Scalia said. \n \n \"Thurgood Marshall rarely asked a question. Bill Brennan rarely asked questions,\" he said, referring to retired iconic justices. \n \n \"Leave Clarence alone!\" Scalia joked. \n \n Carrie Severino, a former clerk for Thomas, said she was surprised Thomas decided to break his silence, because of his long-held belief that the number of questions during oral argument had become excessive. \n \n \"It is possible that Thomas was asking a question that he thought Scalia might have brought up,\" said Severino, \"or, maybe he thought of a question that no one else was asking,\" she said. ||||| FILE - In this Jan. 26, 2012 file photo, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas speaks at College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass.

It had feather-covered forelimbs akin to wings as well as legs covered in feathers in a way that gave the appearance of a second set of wings. \n \n Changyuraptor is not considered a bird but rather a very bird-like dinosaur. It illustrates that it is not always easy to tell what is and is not a bird. It measured a bit more than 4 feet long (1.3 meters) and weighed roughly 9 pounds (4 kg). \n \n If a person saw Changyuraptor, the reaction likely would be: \"Hey! That is a weird-looking bird,\" according to paleontologist Alan Turner of Stony Brook University in New York, one of the researchers. \n \n \"So, think a mid-sized turkey with a very long tail,\" Turner added. \n \n Scientists have identified a handful of these 'four-winged' dinosaurs, known as microraptorines. Changyuraptor is the largest. \n \n Birds arose from small, feathered dinosaurs. Crow-sized Archaeopteryx, which lived about 150 million years ago, is considered the earliest known bird. But many dinosaurs before and after that had feathers and other bird-like characteristics. \n \n \"Changyuraptor is very, very similar to Archaeopteryx and other primitive birds. So are many other dinosaurs like Anchiornis and Pedopenna. But they have some traits that birds lack, and lack some traits that birds have,\" Turner added. \n \n Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County paleontologist Luis Chiappe, who led the study, said Changyuraptor lived in a forested environment in a temperate climate, hunting birds, mammals, small reptiles and fish. \n \n \"Animals like Changyuraptor were probably not engaged in powered flight like modern birds. However, Changyuraptor and dinosaurs like it could flap their wings and certainly had large feathered surfaces on both their forelimbs and hind limbs,\" Turner said. \n \n \"So this does raise the possibility they could glide or 'fly' in a primitive sort of way. The way I like to think of it is: if you pushed them out of a tree, they'd fall pretty slowly,\" Turner added. \n \n If Changyuraptor were able to become airborne, its long tail feathers may have helped reduce descent speed and enabled safe landings. \"This helps explain how animals like Changyuraptor could engage in some form of aerial locomotion - flight, gliding, and/or controlled descents - despite their size,\" Turner added. \n \n In birds today, feathers can serve multiple functions beyond flight, including display, species recognition and mating rituals. Turner said Changyuraptor's feathers also may have served multiple purposes. \n \n China has become a treasure trove for feathered dinosaur fossils. Changyuraptor was unearthed in Liaoning Province in northeastern China. \n \n The study was published in the journal Nature Communications. \n \n (Reporting by Will Dunham; Editing by James Dalgleish) ||||| The largest \"four-winged\" dinosaur known has been found, and this predator has the longest feathers yet outside of birds, researchers say. This new finding yields insights on how dinosaurs may have flown, the scientists added. \n \n The 125-million-year-old feathered dinosaur, named Changyuraptor yangi, sported feathers over its body, including its arms and legs, which made it look as if it had two pairs of wings. Its fossil was unearthed in 2012 in Liaoning province in northeastern China, which has been the center of a surge of discoveries of feathered dinosaurs over the last decade. \n \n \"The vast majority of feathered dinosaurs in Liaoning are collected by farmers who live there,\" said study author Luis Chiappe, a paleontologist and director of the Dinosaur Institute at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County. \n \n The newfound dinosaur is a microraptorine, a group of predatory, feathered dinosaurs related to Velociraptor and other well-known raptor dinosaurs. Analysis of the microscopic structure of this fossil's bones reveal it was a fully grown adult \u2014 a younger specimen's bones would have signs they were still developing. \n \n \"Microraptorines are thought to be very close cousins of birds, sharing a common raptor ancestor,\" Chiappe told Live Science. \"It's not known yet whether a four-wing body is something unique to microraptorines, or something the common ancestor of birds and microraptorines had, that was later lost in the bird lineage.\" [Image Gallery: Dinosaur Fossils] \n \n The researchers estimate 4-foot-long (1.2 meter) Changyuraptor weighed about 9 lbs. (4 kilograms), making it the largest four-winged dinosaur found yet, and at least 60 percent larger than the largest microraptorine specimen found previously, Chiappe said. \n \n When Changyuraptor was alive, the area in which it lived \"was a broad peninsula or wedge into the ocean, with volcanoes,\" Chiappe said. \n \n - Charles Choi, Live Science \n \n This is a condensed version of a report from LiveScience.

In the simplest terms, we have reached the point of de miminis returns in extracting performance from a gallon of diesel while reducing pollutants, at least at reasonable cost. Unsurprisingly, and despite having the greatest research and development program in diesel engines, VW had to cheat to meet current European and U.S. standards. Meeting future tighter diesel standards will prove even more fruitless. \n \n For a significant fraction of the non-compliant diesel cars already in the hands of drivers, there is no real solution. Drivers won\u2019t come in for a fix that compromises performance. Further, solutions which result in net greater CO2 emissions, a regulated pollutant, are inappropriate for CARB to endorse. Retrofitting urea tank systems to small cars is costly and impractical. Some cars may be fixed, but many won\u2019t and will be crushed before they are fixed. \n \n A giant sum of money thus will be wasted in attempting to fix cars that cannot all be fixed, and where the fix may be worse than the problem if the cars are crushed well before the end of their useful lives. We, the undersigned, instead encourage the CARB to show leadership in directing VW to \u201ccure the air, not the cars\u201d and reap multiples of what damage has been caused while strongly advancing California\u2019s interests in transitioning to zero emission vehicles. \n \n The solution we propose for VW and the CARB is to, in a legally enforceable form: \n \n 1./ Release VW from its obligation to fix diesel cars already on the road in California, which represent an insignificant portion of total vehicles emissions in the State, and which cars do not, individually, present any emissions-related risk to their owners or occupants \n \n 2./ Instead, direct VW to accelerate greatly its rollout of zero emission vehicles, which by their very nature, have zero emissions and thus present zero opportunities for cheating, and also do not require any enforcement dollars to verify \n \n 3./ Require that this acceleration of the rollout of zero emissions vehicles by VW result in a 10 for 1 or greater reduction in pollutant emissions as compared to the pollution associated with the diesel fleet cheating, and achieve this over the next 5 years \n \n 4./ Require that VW invest in new manufacturing plants and/or research and development, in the amounts that they otherwise would have been fined, and do so in California to the extent that California would have been allocated its share of the fines \n \n 5./ Allow VW some flexibility in the execution and timing of this plan by allowing it to be implemented via zero emission vehicle credits. \n \n In contrast to the punishments and recalls being considered, this proposal would be a real win for California emissions, a big win for California jobs, and a historic action to help derail climate change. \n \n The bottleneck to the greater availability of zero emissions vehicles is the availability of batteries.

But the day became anything but routine as she made her way through the excited crowd of pupils, and her security detail let down its guard just enough to allow the half-eaten lunch to be hurled in her direction. \n \n Here's the video that shocked a nation: \n \n School offiicals immediately named 16-year-old Kyle Thomson as the lone hurler and suspended him for 15 days. But in a shocking turn of events, Thomson denies that he did anything wrong, and in fact claims that he threw himself in front of the real sandwich thrower in order to protect the PM from near-certain breading. \n \n Listen to Kyle explain to an incredulous reporter how he knocked one sandwich out of the real assailant's hand and then reveals another shocking twist ... there was a second sandwich. \n \n Naturally, the conflicting stories got conspiracy theorists roiling online, with Aussies posting their own thoughts, hypotheses, and jokes to the riveting #sandwichgate hashtag. \n \n I refuse to believe @jonathanvswan's interview on #Sandwichgate until we get video from the grassy knoll: bit.ly/13CycTs \u2014 David Ramli (@Davidramli) May 9, 2013 \n \n so turns out he was prevented a double sandwich throw - Victoria Cross in order?#sandwichgate #hero #auspol media.smh.com.au/national/selec\u2026 \u2014 Daniel (@dankarney) May 9, 2013 \n \n Julia finally gets her legacy We can rest easy Australia, it's over#gillard #sandwichgate #auspol twitter.com/brnfst/status/\u2026 \u2014 Wot do ya call this? (@brnfst) May 9, 2013 \n \n Adding to the intriguing puzzle, some are now claiming the sandwich was not even Vegemite! (Perhaps suggesting a foreign agent?) \n \n It was a chicken sandwich, not vegemite! 15 y/o Kyle will be back at school tomorrow - video showed he didn't throw it at PM #sandwichgate \u2014 Alissa Thibault (@AlissaThibault) May 9, 2013 \n \n Anti-Gillard sandwich was chicken, not Vegemite; now no longer classified as a deadly biological weapon #Sandwichgate \u2014 Baz McAlister (@bazmcalister) May 9, 2013 \n \n It's not the first time Gillard or other Australian PMs have been targeted either. \n \n Nine News uncovers a third occasion when a projectile was thrown at the PM see it tonight @9newsbrisbane #sandwichgate \u2014 Sophie Walsh (@sophie_walsh9) May 9, 2013 \n \n Obviously, there are worse things that can be thrown at you, like shoes. As Gillard's predecessor, John Howard, once found out. And apparently it was an egg toss at then-PM Billy Hughes back in 1917 that led to the formation of Australia's Federal Police force. Gillard, however, took the sandwich assault in stride showing a brave face as she laughed off the incident. Though there are obviously still many unanswered questions that only a special parliamentary commission can uncover. (Like \"Is this is all a massive inside joke that Australians are pulling on the rest of us?) \n \n In the end, we think the assessment by Kyle Thomson, of the leader he bravely swore to defend, kind of sums up the whole matter: \n \n \"She doesn't have a big nose like everyone's saying. She's small and ... yeah, famous.\" \n \n Want to add to this story? Let us know in comments or send an email to the author at dbennett at theatlantic dot com.

The child\u2019s father, Austin Thurston, felt a school suspension over the Monday incident involving Elijah Thurston was excessive. \n \n Elijah Thurston, 6, was suspended from Stratton Meadows Elementary School for one day. An official at the Colorado public school reportedly explained to the first grader what the word \u201cdead\u201d meant and told him not to \u201cconfuse\u201d activities in gameplay with reality. \n \n \u201cI know they have zero tolerance, but more of a maybe no recess. Going as far as a one-day suspension is a little extreme for a 6-year-old in a first-grade class,\u201d Austin Thurston said during an interview with KRDO News. \u201cOf course I think he was playing. What 6-year-old doesn\u2019t play cops and robbers, or cowboys and Indians?\u201d \n \n A Harrison School District 2 representative told the local media that the Stratton Meadows Elementary School suspension for the finger gun was appropriate. The spokesperson would not elaborate on the finger gun pointing incident, stating student privacy. The suspension will be included on Elijah Thurston\u2019s permanent record. \n \n Austin Thurston had this to say when asked what he and his wife has discussed with Elijah in regards to guns. \n \n \u201cWe just told him there\u2019s a time and a place for everything, and we told him school is never a place for that. We let him know that the guns in the wrong hands will be very dangerous. He knows the difference between really doing that, and just putting your finger up and saying, \u2018boom you\u2019re dead.\u2019 We made sure he understands the severity of what he said.\u201d \n \n The Colorado first grader is writing a letter of apology to the school and stating in his own words that he understands his actions. The apology letter was not required by the school district. The school suspension for the finger gun-pointing incident is just one of many cases where a young student was punished for a similar act, making a paper gun or a gun shape out of food, or bringing a toy gun to school. \n \n Many adults can still remember taking guns to school and making or buying pretend swords and knives to go with Halloween costumes for school parties. Many schools in America used to have gun clubs and shooting teams. During this long-gone era, school shootings were not making national headlines. \n \n What do you think about the Colorado first grader being suspended for making a finger gun shape? \n \n [Image via: Shutterstock.com] ||||| A Virginia couple has filed a lawsuit against their son\u2019s school, the school resource officer, and the Bedford County Sheriff\u2019s Office after their 11-year-old son was kicked out of school for bringing a plant \u2014 that wasn\u2019t pot \u2014 to school, the Roanoke Times is reporting. \n \n The troubles for the unnamed sixth-grader, identified only as RMB, began in September 2014. Melvin Williams, the lawyer for Bruce and Linda Bays, the boy\u2019s parents, says that the boy was at school when word somehow got to school administrators that he had a bag of marijuana and a lighter in his backpack. \n \n \u201cWe know they relied on \u2018tips\u2019 that after the fact turn out to be less than reliable.\u201d \n \n The boy was in gym class when he was summoned to the principal\u2019s office. There, the principal, in the presence of the school resource officer, emptied the boy\u2019s backpack and found a bag containing leaves and a lighter. He was immediately suspended for 10 days, pending an administrative hearing, then kicked out of school for a year. The school resource officer also filed marijuana possession charges against the youth in juvenile court. \n \n There was only one problem: three tests on the plant that the boy brought to school determined that it wasn\u2019t marijuana, according to Raw Story. \n \n \u201cThe field test came back not inconclusive, but negative. Yet [Resource Officer Calohan] went to a magistrate and swore he possessed marijuana at school.\u201d \n \n RMB\u2019s parents believe that he was likely the victim of a prank; RMB rides the same bus with high school students and his parents believe an older teen likely put the substance into his backpack without RMB knowing about it, a claim the school has rejected. \n \n The school maintains that the fact that the substance the boy allegedly brought to school turned out not to be marijuana is irrelevant; under the school\u2019s Zero Tolerance drug policy, \u201clookalike\u201d drugs are also forbidden. \n \n The case illustrates how schools\u2019 so-called \u201cZero Tolerance\u201d policies, while well-intentioned, can sometimes be taken to ridiculous lengths. Earlier this month, according to this Inquisitr report, a first-grader in Colorado was suspended, under his school\u2019s zero-tolerance violence policy, for pointing his finger in the shape of a gun. \n \n RMB will be allowed to resume attending school \u2014 at an alternative school and under strict probationary guidelines \u2014 on Monday, but his parents want him back in his old school, with his record expunged. \n \n RMB\u2019s parents claim that, since their son\u2019s suspension for bringing not-marijuana to school, the gifted and talented student has been withdrawn, and is being treated by a child psychiatrist for depression and panic attacks. \n \n [Image courtesy of: Set Apart People] ||||| The seed for Wide00014 was: \n \n - Slash pages from every domain on the web: \n \n \n \n \n \n -- a ranking of all URLs that have more than one incoming inter-domain link (rank was determined by number of incoming links using Wide00012 inter domain links) \n \n \n \n -- up to a maximum of 100 most highly ranked URLs per domain \n \n - Top ranked pages (up to a max of 100) from every linked-to domain using the Wide00012 inter-domain navigational link graph",

Turns out, however, that three tests found the leaf wasn't pot at all, and the juvenile charges were dropped, the Roanoke Times reports. But things with the school weren't so simple: Only now, six months after the case began, has RMB been able to return to class at a different school, and he remains on probation. That time away has taken a toll. The son of Bruce and Linda Bays of Bedford County, both teachers, used to be an easygoing, upbeat child. Now he gets panic attacks, suffers from depression, and fears authority figures. After a disciplinary hearing, his mother tells the Times, \"he just broke down and said his life was over. He would never be able to get into college; he would never be able to get a job.\" He's being treated by a psychiatrist, and his parents have launched a federal lawsuit against Bedford County Schools and the county sheriff's office. But the suit could face a hurdle when it comes to school drug policy: It also bans \"imitation controlled substances,\" defined as a \"pill, capsule, tablet, or other item which is not a controlled substance.\" In the meantime, it remains unclear how the leaf got in RMB's bag. The Inquisitr points to concerns about \"zero tolerance\" school policies, noting that this month, a 6-year-old was suspended for shaping his hand like a gun\u2014and it wasn't the first such suspension.",

O\u2019Reilly\u2019s decision to go off the air in the midst of a sexual harassment scandal and advertiser boycott arguably has the appearance of a suspension, but O\u2019Reilly worked to dispel that notion. He announced that he\u2019d scheduled his trip \u201clast fall\u201d \u2014 well before the New York Times reported he paid $13 million to settle harassment claims. A Fox News spokesperson confirmed O\u2019Reilly will return on April 24. \n \n Here\u2019s how O\u2019Reilly talked about his vacation on the show Tuesday night. \n \n But according to four network sources, there\u2019s talk inside Fox News that tonight\u2019s show could be his last. Lawyers for the law firm Paul, Weiss, hired last summer by 21st Century Fox to investigate Roger Ailes, are currently doing a \u201cdeep dive\u201d investigation into O\u2019Reilly\u2019s behavior. They\u2019re focused now on sexual harassment claims by O\u2019Reilly guest Wendy Walsh after she reported her claims via the company\u2019s anonymous hotline. \n \n Fox News co-president Bill Shine has been working hard to keep O\u2019Reilly, sources said.

Two highly placed Fox News sources say 21st Century Fox CEO James Murdoch would like O\u2019Reilly to be permanently taken off the air, while his father, Rupert, and older brother, Lachlan, are more inclined to keep him. (A spokesperson for the Murdochs declined to comment.) \n \n That dynamic \u2014 James pushing for swift action, while Rupert resists \u2014 played out last summer in the Ailes scandal. James, of course, got his way with Ailes. With more than three dozen advertisers boycotting O\u2019Reilly, Fox staffers speculate the same may happen to O\u2019Reilly, perhaps as early as during his vacation. \u201cThe assumption is that he\u2019ll exit in a non-embarrassing way,\u201d one senior Fox News staffer told me.",

These tensions are further aggravated and elevated into a sense of unpredictability when the exercises are not pre-notified or publicly announced beforehand, as is apparently the case with a number of Russian exercises. \n \n In our view, the implementation of the following four recommendations could help to defuse or at least minimize the tensions connected with the increased frequency and scale of the military exercises now taking place: ||||| Intensified military exercises by Russia and NATO are fueling tensions in Europe that have already been heightened by the conflict in Ukraine, a research group said. \n \n While Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization call the drills defensive, they may treat each other\u2019s actions \u201cas provocative and deliberate aggravation,\u201d worsening mistrust, according to a report Wednesday by the London-based European Leadership Network. The two sides are readying in case of confrontation, it said. \n \n The former Cold War foes have stepped up military activity, especially near the Baltic region, after Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea last year. The war in Ukraine has prompted NATO to create command units across eastern Europe, while Russia has recalibrated its military goals toward the transatlantic alliance, which it accuses of approaching its borders. \n \n \u201cWe don\u2019t suggest that the leadership of either side has made a decision to go to war or that a military conflict between the two is inevitable,\u201d the ELN said. Even so, \u201cthe changed profile of exercises is a fact and it does play a role in sustaining the current climate of tensions in Europe.\u201d \n \n NATO and Russia should communicate better on plans to hold military drills to lessen the risk of incidents, according to the ELN. It recommended limiting exercises in border areas. \n \n Neither Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov nor his deputy Andrei Bobrun replied to phone calls made by Bloomberg. \n \n \u2018Well Ahead\u2019 \n \n The ELN report \u201cmisleadingly puts NATO and Russian exercises on par,\u201d Carmen Romero, the military alliance\u2019s deputy spokeswoman, said by e-mail. \n \n The authorities in Moscow have announced more than 4,000 drills this year, more than 10-fold NATO\u2019s plans, and Russian exercises have also involved nuclear and nuclear-capable forces, according to Romero. NATO is \u201cwell ahead\u201d of the ELN\u2019s recommendations, she said. \n \n \u201cThe scale and scope of Russia\u2019s exercises are far beyond anything the alliance is doing and they are increasing tensions across the region,\u201d Romero said. \u201cRussia is deliberately avoiding military transparency and predictability.\u201d \n \n President Vladimir Putin last month approved Russia\u2019s new naval doctrine that puts greater focus on the Atlantic and the Arctic to counter NATO\u2019s activity near its borders. \n \n Wargames Might Help Russia Sell Some Tanks \n \n Read this next: \n \n The U.S.-led alliance has tried to calm nerves of late. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said last month that he doesn\u2019t see an immediate threat to the alliance\u2019s members. NATO plans to reduce by half the number of aircraft deployed for air patrols in the Baltic region, whose skies have seen a surge in Russian activity. ||||| This post has been updated to include a response to the report from NATO. \n \n MOSCOW \u2013 The Russian military exercises in March spanned the nation\u2019s vast territory \u2013 from the high north, far above the Arctic Circle, all the way to territories near Japan. Massive NATO drills a few months later pulled thousands of troops across Europe. After decades of post-Cold War calm, Europe is again becoming a region of high military drama \u2013 and according to some experts, a place with a growing risk of accidental confrontation. \n \n Russian soldiers woke in early March to unannounced, snap exercises that eventually grew to encompass more than 80,000 service members. Above the Barents Sea, strategic bombers practiced attacks. Near the Latvian border, airborne troops performed landings as attack helicopters and artillery gave them cover. In the Baltic Sea, the Russian Navy practiced with missiles. \n \n The training was on such a large scale that it could only have been practicing for what would happen during a war with the U.S.-led NATO defense alliance, according to the European Leadership Network, which on Wednesday published a report looking at the increased military exercises on both sides of the Russia-West divide. \n \n The Russian exercises: \n \n The Northern Fleet: Conducts mine-sweeping, anti-submarine and air defense operations in the Barents and Norwegian Seas. Strategic bombers practice attacks with fighter support and airborne units simulate helicopter landings in combat areas. Naval fighters simulate interceptions of enemy aircraft. Kola Peninsula and Arctic Islands: Airborne and ground units from the interior are redeployed to the Kola Peninsula. Airborne troops land on Russia\u2019s Arctic Islands. The Baltic Sea fleet: Performed search and destroy simulations, air defense tactics, missile and artillery practice. Naval aviation units conduct night training. Ground units perform nighttime live-fire exercises. Airborne operations: Airborne troops perform landings near the Latvian border while attack helicopters and artillery conduct fire support for ground forces. The Black Sea Fleet: Conducts search and destroy simulations, anti-submarine and mine sweeping operations. Marines practice live-fire exercises. Eastern Front: Ground units conduct simulated combat operations on Sakhalin and Kuril islands. \n \n NATO has also been practicing in eastern Europe, though on a smaller scale. Its Allied Shield exercises in June brought together 15,000 service members from 19 member nations and three partners, and it has stepped up exercises in reaction to Russian threats as a way, NATO leaders say, of deterring Kremlin aggression. \n \n But with communications links between the two sides frayed, intentions can quickly be misread, raising the risk of accidental confrontation, the European Leadership Network argues. And with tensions at their highest since the Cold War \u2013 but without Cold-War-era lifelines for communication \u2013 there is a greater chance for unpleasant surprises. Already, there have been near-misses with Russian military aircraft getting dangerously close to civilian jetliners above the Baltic Sea. \n \n The NATO exercises: \n \n BALTOPS 15: Baltic Sea naval exercise focusing on amphibious operations in Sweden and Poland. Consisted of 49 ships, 61 aircraft, 1 submarine and 700 landing troops. Operations were conducted near Russia\u2019s exclave of Kaliningrad. Saber Strike 15: Large-scale armored and airborne live-fire operations with close air support involving 6,000 troops in Lithuania, Latvia, Poland and Estonia. Trident Joust: Exercises focus on coordination large-scale allied operations and the redeployment of NATO headquarters to the area of those operations. Noble Jump: First deployment of NATO\u2019s Very High Readiness Joint Task Force which is to provide a rapid response to infiltration of an allied territory by enemy special forces and irregular personnel. Over 2,100 troops from nine NATO states participated. \n \n The risk of escalation is high, with each side watching the other train, and concluding that even more military exercises are necessary. \n \n \u201cThe changed profile of these exercises is a fact and plays a role in sustaining the current climate of fear and tension in Europe,\u201d wrote Ian Kearns, one of the report\u2019s authors. \n \n The group is pushing for more direct links between the two sides, warning each other about the exercises. In the longer run, it says, new arms control efforts would help quell tensions. \n \n NATO has argued that its exercises are simply a defense deterrent, aimed at communicating the alliance\u2019s determination to fight on behalf of nations such as the Baltics that feel threatened by Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine. \n \n Russia\u2019s \"exercises are part of a more aggressive Russian military doctrine,\" said NATO deputy spokeswoman Carmen Romero in a statement in response to the report. \"In response, NATO has increased its presence in the eastern part of our alliance, in order to enhance collective defense.\" \n \n She added: \"Russia has consistently refused all NATO offers for greater military transparency, dating back to well before the current crisis.\" \n \n Russian leaders, meanwhile, have long complained of NATO\u2019s expansion to their borders and say that it is a threat to Russia\u2019s own security interests. Russian President Vladimir Putin cited the risk of NATO expansion into Ukraine as one of the reasons last year that he annexed the Crimean Peninsula, home of Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet. They, too, may be seeking to deter what they see as an increasingly active alliance \u2013 although it did not spark back into life in eastern Europe until after the Russian takeover of Crimea. \n \n The back-and-forth is a \"dangerous dynamic,\" the report\u2019s authors write. \n \n For now, neither side appears likely to back down. \n \n Read more: \n \n Russia\u2019s anti-American fever goes beyond the Soviet era\u2019s \n \n U.S. military vehicles paraded 300 yards from the Russian border",

The European Leadership Network says that although reps from both sides may insist these training exercises\u2014including a flurry of activity in March for Russia and in June for NATO, per the Post\u2014are against hypothetical opponents, it's clear there are definite foes in mind, and that alleviative measures need to take place ASAP to stave off a possible confrontation. \"Russia is preparing for a conflict with NATO, and NATO is preparing for a possible confrontation with Russia,\" the report asserts, adding that even though this doesn't make a real conflict unavoidable, it helps perpetuate tension in the region\u2014especially thick since the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The organization's recommendation: Tamp down the size and scale of said exercises, start hammering out a new treaty on limiting the types of weapons used along the borders, and publicly announce beforehand when exercises are being held (Russia is pointed out as a prime offender in this regard). But a NATO rep told Bloomberg that the ELN report \"misleadingly puts NATO and Russian exercises on par\" and that \"the scale and scope of Russia's exercises are far beyond anything the alliance is doing.

The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union represents about 5,000 Hostess employees. \n \n \"We deeply regret the necessity of today's decision, but we do not have the financial resources to weather an extended nationwide strike,\" said CEO Gregory Rayburn in a statement. \n \n Hostess will move to sell its assets to the highest bidder. That could mean new life for some of its most popular products, which could be scooped up at auction and attached to products from other companies. \n \n A letter that Hostess sent to its network of stores that carry its product said it expects \"there will be great interest in our brands.\" But it said it could not give a time frame for when the sales would take place and when its products would be available again. \n \n But even if those brands are bought and restarted, the Hostess workers will not get their jobs back. \n \n Related: Hostess workers face tough job market \n \n \"It's been a very sad day,\" Rayburn told CNN. \"I think that this was just a monumental failure on the part of everyone involved, and it was just the wrong outcome.\" \n \n Hostess filed for bankruptcy in January, its second trip to bankruptcy court since 2004. It previously emerged from restructuring in 2009 after a four-and-a-half year process. The company is now controlled by a group of investment firms, including hedge funds Silver Point Capital and Monarch Alternative Capital. \n \n Frank Hurt, president of the bakers' union, called the liquidation \"a deep disappointment\" but said his members weren't the ones responsible, blaming the various management teams in place at Hostess over the past eight years for failing to turn the firm around. \n \n \"Our members decided they were not going to take any more abuse from a company they have given so much to for so many years,\" Hurt said in a statement late Friday. \"They decided that they were not going to agree to another round of outrageous wage and benefit cuts and give up their pension only to see yet another management team fail and Wall Street vulture capitalists and 'restructuring specialists' walk away with untold millions of dollars.\" \n \n While approval of the bankruptcy court is needed before Hostess can start selling its assets in liquidation, the company said production at all of its bakeries stopped effective Friday, and that stores will no longer receive products from Hostess Brands after the final round of deliveries of products that were made Thursday night. \n \n But products that are already in stores can be sold, and the outlet stores will remain open for about a week to sell the products they already have. \n \n Related: The end of Hostess \n \n Hostess had annual sales of about $2.5 billion. The company said it had been making 500 million Twinkies and 127 million loaves of Wonder Bread annually before Friday's shutdown. \n \n Its bread brands, including Wonder Bread, Nature's Pride and Butternut, make the company the No. 2 bread baker in the country, according to Symphony/IRI Group. Bimbo Bakeries, maker of the Arnold and Stroehmann brands, is the No. 1 bread baker. \n \n The company had given a 5 p.m. ET Thursday deadline for the bakers to return to work or face a shutdown of the company. \n \n Related: The history of labor battles at Hostess \n \n In September, membership of one of its major unions, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, voted narrowly to accept a new contract with reduced wages and benefits. The Bakers' union rejected the deal, however, prompting Hostess management to secure permission from a bankruptcy court to force a new concession contract on workers. \n \n The Teamsters union, which represents 6,700 Hostess workers, issued a statement blaming mismanagement by Hostess executives for the company's problems. But it also was critical of the decision of Bakers' union, although it did not identify the union by name. \n \n \"Unfortunately, the company's operating and financial problems were so severe that it required steep concessions from a variety of stakeholders but not all stakeholders were willing to be constructive,\" said Ken Hall, the Teamsters' Secretary-Treasurer. \"Teamster Hostess members, based on the facts and advice from respected restructuring advisors, understood what was at stake and voted to protect all jobs at Hostess.\" \n \n Related: Don't worry - Twinkies will survive \n \n The new contract cut salaries across the company by 8% in the first year of the five-year agreement. Salaries were then scheduled to bump up 3% in the next three years and 1% in the final year. \n \n Hostess also reduced its pension obligations and its contribution to the employees' health care plan.

    "document": "About 10,000 people from Myanmar fled across the border into Thailand on Monday to escape fighting between Myanmar government forces and a splinter group of rebels of the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army, military and border officials told CNN. \n \n The rebels and Myanmar forces clashed over control of the town of Myawaddy, which sits across the Moei River from Mae Sot, Thailand. The Thailand-Burma Friendship bridge connects the two towns. \n \n Lt. Col. Vannathit Wongwai, commander of Thailand's 3rd Region Army, said Myanmar military officials told him they had retaken control of Myawaddy at 5 p.m. local time after bringing in 500 reinforcements to battle the Karen splinter group. \n \n At least five Myanmar refugees and five Thais were injured in the fighting. Shells fell on the Thai side of the border, but the Thai military did not return fire, military officials told the Bangkok Post. \n \n According to a report on the website Burma Election Tracker, the clashes began when DKBA militia members who had been employed as government border security troops rebelled because the Myanmar military was forcing people to vote at gunpoint. \n \n \"In order to win votes in the elections, [the junta] is bullying and forcing people to vote. But the people want to boycott [the vote], so the soldiers are holding them at gunpoint and our troops had to intervene and take sides with the people,\" the website report quotes Brig. Gen. Na Kham Mwe, head of the breakaway DKBA faction, as saying. \n \n Polls were supposed to have closed Sunday in Myanmar's first election in 20 years, which critics have called a fa\u00e7ade of democracy put forth by the ruling military junta. \n \n Opposition parties were either limited in the candidates they could run or boycotted the election altogether. The junta did not allow international monitors. \n \n The Karen ethnic minority in Myanmar is divided into two main groups, Buddhists who support the ruling junta and Christians who do not. Those behind Monday's clashes have split from the pro-junta group. ||||| Thousands of Myanmar refugees have crossed into Thailand amid the clashes [Reuters] Fighting between Myanmar government troops and ethnic fighters has sent at least 10,000 people fleeing into Thailand a day after the military-led nation held a much-criticised election. \n \n \n \n Clashes were reported on Monday at key points on the border with Thailand, leaving at least three people dead and 10 others wounded on both sides of the frontier. \n \n \n \n The clashes follow a demonstration by the fighters over Sunday's general election, Myanmar's first in 20 years, as well as attempts to force ethnic minority troops to join a border guard force - which would put them under state control. A simmering civil war has wracked parts of Myanmar since independence in 1948 and observers say the state's determination to crush ethnic anti-government fighters appeared to have increased in the lead up to the election. \n \n \n \n In the heaviest fighting, Karen fighters reportedly seized a police station and post office on Sunday in the Myanmar border town of Myawaddy. \n \n \n \n Sporadic gun and mortar fire continued into Monday afternoon. Stray rocket \n \n \n \n Al Jazeera's Marga Ortigas, reporting from the Thai border town of Mae Sot, said that a stray rocket propelled grenade crossed into Thailand, injuring five people. \n \n \n \n \"The clashes appear to be between a faction linked to the Democratic Karen Buddhist Army (DKBA) and government-backed troops,\" Ortigas said. \n \n \n \n \"This faction has said it did not support the ceasefire the DKBA signed with the Myanmar government, and have reiterated that they want their own autonomy.\" \n \n \n \n Our correspondent also said refugees from Myanmar who crossed the border into Thailand feared government troops would shoot them for failing to vote on Sunday. Zipporah Sein, the general secretary of the Karen National Union (KNU), said fighting broke out between up to 300 DKBA soldiers and government forces. \"We don't know definitely but I think last night the army sent over more troops, they negotiated and the DKBA retreated but this morning they were blocked by army trucks and then it started,\" she said. 'Foul play' \n \n \n \n Myanmar, also known as Burma, drew international criticism over Sunday's vote with Barack Obama, the US president, saying the election was stolen. \n \n Al Jazeera's special correspondent reports on the difficulty in ascertaining the true will of the people \"It is unacceptable to steal elections, as the regime in Burma has done again for all the world to see,\" Obama, currently on a tour of four Asian nations, said in a speech to India's parliament in New Delhi. \n \n \n \n Europe and Japan also condemned the conduct of the poll as state TV reported that voters \"freely and happily\" cast their ballots. \n \n \n \n State media, featuring photos of Than Shwe, the country's ruling general and other senior leaders voting, announced the \"winners\" in 57 constituencies, 55 of which were contested by just one candidate, more than two thirds of those with the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP). \n \n \n \n In many constituencies, the poll was a two-way battle between the USDP and the National Unity Party (NUP), which is the successor to former leader Ne Win's party and also closely aligned with the military. A senior government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said voter turnout was estimated at more than 60 per cent but that the results from the whole country could take one week. Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, said voting conditions had been \"insufficiently inclusive, participatory and transparent\". Than Nyein, chairman of the National Democratic Force, created by former members of the National League for Democracy (NLD), led by detained opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, said the election was marred by irregularities. \n \n \n \n \"It's very different from our expectation because of foul play,\" he told the AFP news agency. \n \n \n \n \"We have our evidence. Some candidates complained ... because there was vote cheating.\" \n \n \n \n 'Missed opportunity' Abhisit Vejjajiva, the Thai prime minister, has said that ethnic minority clashes with the military in eastern Myanmar could continue for months. He also said that the country was ready to provide humanitarian assistance as refugee numbers continue to rise. \n \n \n \n \"It is possible that it will carry on during the next three months, particularly during the transition from the current government to an elected government,\" Abhisit told reporters in the Bangkok, the Thai capital. \n \n \n \n With no specific time given for the release of election results, Western powers were labelling the vote as a \"missed opportunity\". But some saw the poll as a small step towards democracy after almost five decades of military rule, with opposition parties confident of success in areas they did contest. \n \n \n \n However, with 25 per cent of the seats in parliament reserved for military appointees regardless of the outcome, the two main pro-military parties needed to win just 26 per cent of the remaining seats to secure a majority. \n \n \n \n Al Jazeera's correspondent in Myanmar added that despite opposition groups running in the polls, electoral advantages had been skewed towards the USDP. Advance ballots \n \n \n \n Two opposition parties accused the USDP of illegally collecting advance ballots. Election Facts 29 million eligible voters 40,000 polling stations 3,071 candidates from 37 political parties 82 independent candidates 494 seats in the two-chamber parliament 665 seats spread among 14 regional parliaments The NDF said some people had complained that they were told by the USDP there was no need to vote as their ballots had already been collected. More than 29 million people were eligible to vote but it remains uncertain as to how many actually cast ballots. \n \n \n \n International condemnation of the polls continued to grow, with Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, saying Washington would maintain \"rigorous sanctions\" against the Myanmar government. \n \n \n \n The electoral process was \"severely flawed, precluded an inclusive, level playing field, and repressed fundamental freedoms,\" Clinton said. After the election, attention is now turning to whether the government will release Aung San Suu Kyi on Saturday, when her current term of house arrest ends. \n \n \n \n The Nobel Peace Prize winner led the NLD to power in 1990 but the result was never recognised by the ruling generals. \n \n \n \n She has been detained for most of the last 20 years and supported a boycott of Sunday's election.",

What's emerged is that collectively, these companies own an astounding number of consumer profiles, and they're selling deeply personal information \u2014 sometimes to identity thieves \u2014 in categories like rape victims, people with cancer, and \u201cRural and Barely Making It.\u201d \n \n One data broker is selling lists of addresses and names of consumers suffering from conditions including cancer, diabetes, and depression, and the medications used for those conditions; another is offering lists naming consumers, their credit scores, and specific health conditions. \n \n Of the nine companies the Committee approached \u2014 Acxiom, Experian, Epsilon, Reed Elsevier, Equifax, TransUnion, Rapleaf, Spokeo, and Datalogix \u2014 \"some\" were forthcoming. The report mentions Equifax as being particularly cooperative. \n \n Others weren't. Acxiom, which according to the report has \u201cmulti-sourced insight into approximately 700 million consumers worldwide,\u201d Experian, and Epsilon refused to explain how they collected their data or who they were selling it to, citing confidentiality clauses in their contracts. (The Attorney General of New Jersey recently released documents indicating Acxiom sold another company, Dataium, 400,000 dossiers for a mere $2,500.) \n \n In October, Experian admitted that it sold personal information \u2014 including social security numbers and banking information \u2014 through a subsidiary to an alleged online identity theft ring. That same subsidiary, Court Ventures, also appeared on a list of companies that requested private information about gun permit holders in Virginia. \n \n Equifax told the Committee they had information as specific as: \n \n Whether a consumer purchased a particular soft drink or shampoo product in the last six months \n \n Whether they use laxatives or yeast infection products \n \n How many OB/GYN doctor visits they've had within the last 12 months \n \n How many miles they traveled in the last 4 weeks \n \n The number of whiskey drinks they consumed in the past 30 days. \n \n That data is then sorted into a dictionary with more than 75,000 data points like, \"whether the individual or household is a pet owner, smokes, has a propensity to purchase prescriptions through the mail, donates to charitable causes, is active military or a veteran, holds certain insurance products including burial insurance or juvenile life insurance, enjoys reading romance novels, or is a hunter.\" \n \n Privacy groups testified that the companies also sell lists of rape victims and people with HIV and AIDs. \n \n This fine-tuned data collection isn't new \u2014 last year, the Times reported a story of how Target figured out a teenager was pregnant before her father did. Even in 2007, the Times reported on a company selling lists like, \u201cOldies but Goodies,\u201d 500,000 gamblers over 55 years old, for 8.5 cents each, and one list that said: \u201cThese people are gullible. They want to believe that their luck can change.\u201d \n \n But their databases are growing infinitely, and there are still no relevant consumer protection laws in place to protect individual privacy. And despite recent transparency efforts \u2014 like Acxiom's aboutthedata.com \u2014 that also means the consumers on these lists still have no right to find out what information is out there, or who is buying it. \n \n [image via Shutterstock] ||||| NEW YORK (CNNMoney) \n \n Consumer data companies are selling lists of rape victims, seniors with dementia and even those suffering from HIV and AIDS to marketers, underscoring the need for tighter government regulations, a privacy group told Congress Wednesday. \n \n The World Privacy Forum uncovered these lists, along with several others, while investigating how data brokers collect and sell consumer information. Marketers buy this data so they can target shoppers based on everything from their income to clothing size. \n \n Other lists the nonprofit found included the home addresses of police officers, a mailing list for domestic violence shelters (which are typically kept secret by law) and a list of people with addictive behaviors towards drug and alcohol. \n \n The mere existence of these lists highlights the need for increased government regulations, said World Privacy Forum executive director Pam Dixon. \n \n Related: What your zip code reveals about you \n \n \"This is where I urge Congress to take action,\" she said Wednesday at a Senate committee hearing. \"Highly sensitive data are the frayed and ugly ends of the bell curve of lists, far from the center. This is where lawmakers can work to remove unsafe, unfair and overall just deplorable lists from circulation.\" \n \n Currently, data brokers are required by federal law to maintain the privacy of a consumer's data only if it is used for credit, employment, insurance or housing. And while medical privacy laws prohibit doctors from sharing patient information, medical information that data brokers get elsewhere, such as from the purchase of over-the-counter drugs and other health care items, is fair game. \n \n In some cases, such lists could put people in harm's way. The list of more than 30,000 police officers' home addresses, for example, could put the lives of the officers and their families in danger, said Dixon. Meanwhile, a list of seniors suffering from dementia could open them up to predatory financial offers. \n \n Related: Find out what Big Data knows about you \n \n Linda Woolley, president of the Direct Marketing Association, said in a statement that such lists represent a \"tiny minority\" of marketing products. \n \n \"We recognize that there are situations in which lists are being used to disparage certain groups,\" she said. \"That is not something that DMA supports.\" \n \n She added that some names of lists may be misleading as to the information it contains and that most lists typically focus on a person's likely interests, such as whether someone is a \"sports enthusiast\" or \"avid traveler.\" \n \n Some data brokers offer ways to opt out, but many have unclear opt-out procedures or none at all. Plus, most consumers have no idea they're on the lists in the first place, said Dixon. \n \n Related: What your wireless carrier knows about you \n \n Wednesday's hearing came after a year-long Senate committee investigation into the $156 billion data brokerage industry. The Federal Trade Commission has also called on major data brokers to increase transparency into their data practices. \n \n Committee chairman John \"Jay\" Rockefeller criticized several of the country's largest data brokers for resisting the oversight and said he would continue to push for information on how they get data and who they sell it to. \n \n In his closing remarks, the senator said he was \"revolted\" by the lists Dixon had revealed and said the commission would continue to explore the issue. \n \n \"I think it's our job as government to... bring into sunlight what is going on,\" he said. \"I think its serious, and I think it's a dark underside of American life, in which people make a lot of money and cause people to suffer even more.\"",

But Clinton\u2019s overall fundraising machine remains formidable: combined with the $47.5 million she raised in the second quarter, her campaign has brought in roughly $75 million in six months. Sanders, by comparison, raised just $15 million in his first few months. \n \n While considerably less than her first haul, Clinton's $28 million figure doesn\u2019t come as a huge surprise to her team. The campaign had expected her numbers to drop during the summer months, while she was dogged by questions about her email practices at the State Department and falling poll numbers in the early-voting states. \n \n \"We are thrilled and grateful for the support of hundreds of thousands of donors across the country, helping us raise a record $75 million in the first two quarters,\" said Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook in a statement. \n \n The campaign's joint fundraising committee with the Democratic National Committee and state parties brought in over $3 million, the campaign said. \n \n But Sanders\u2019 own eye-popping haul \u2014 he raised $2.07 million online on Sept 30 alone \u2014 gives Democrats reason for pause. Much of the party establishment\u2019s argument against Sanders centers on whether he could stand head to head against a well-funded Republican in the general election. His now-demonstrated fundraising prowess hardly erases such concerns, but it calls the assumption into question. \n \n Clinton\u2019s allies also take solace in knowing that she has affiliated super PACs with considerable fundraising power, while Sanders refuses to associate with any such groups. Priorities USA Action, the big-money Clinton group, told POLITICO it had raised $40 million so far in 2015 by mid-August. \n \n Sanders\u2019 campaign said on Wednesday that it had passed the one-million contributor mark in the third quarter, while Clinton\u2019s own operation said that 93 percent of her third-quarter donations came in increments of less than $100. \n \n The full disclosures for the period that ended Sept. 30 will be released next week, and filings from both contenders will be scrutinized not only for the details about where the money came from but how the campaign then spent it. ||||| Boston (CNN) Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign raised more than $28 million in the third fundraising quarter of 2015, a number only slightly more than the $25 million Bernie Sanders raised. \n \n Clinton's third quarter fundraising brings her total haul to $75 million, aides said. And while it is less than the $45 million Clinton's campaign raised in the second quarter, it appears the campaign is likely to reach it's $100 million goal by the end of 2015. \n \n Sanders' fundraising is closing in on Clinton, however, despite only ever headlining seven fundraisers as a candidate.

His campaign announced just before the Wednesday filing deadline that it has received more than a million online donations, making him the first 2016 candidate to pass that milestone and the first ever to pass it so early, reports the Wall Street Journal, which notes that the Obama campaigns got there in February 2008 and October 2011. According to the filing, Sanders' fundraising is rapidly catching up with Hillary Clinton's, with the Vermont senator raising $25 million in the third quarter of this year, not far off the $28 million his rival raised during the same period, although her second-quarter numbers were much higher, CNN reports. Most of Clinton's cash in the third quarter came from the 58 fundraising events she headlined that asked donors to pay $2,700, CNN reports, while almost all of Sanders' take came from the online operation, which had an average donation of $24.86. But he has had to spend money to make money: The New York Times estimates that the Sanders campaign has already spent $15 million, mostly on hiring staff and on online fundraising, without spending much on commercials or polling. Politico calls his haul \"eye-popping\" and notes that it undercuts arguments that Sanders couldn't compete with a well-funded Republican. Clinton, however, has affiliated super PACs on her side and Sanders shuns such groups. (Polls show that Clinton is falling behind in New Hampshire.)",

That \u201cworks with Alexa\u201d phrasing and the fact that this isn\u2019t the \u201cEcho Microwave\u201d should tell you that this thing doesn\u2019t have any microphones or a speaker (beyond one that can beep) on it. Instead, it\u2019s a $59.99 device meant to showcase Amazon\u2019s new system for companies to make their regular gadgets into smart gadgets. \n \n The way the Alexa integration works is pretty clever: when you set it up, it will get paired to your Alexa system as \u201cthe microwave,\u201d and then you can command Alexa to, you know, cook stuff. There are very few buttons on the microwave because all the presets for various food types have been stored in Amazon\u2019s cloud instead. \n \n It is, indeed, a microwave \n \n There is an Alexa button on the microwave, and it does two things: it turns on the microphone on one of your Echo speakers so you don\u2019t have to use the \u201cAlexa\u201d wake word, and, more importantly, it sends a signal so that whatever you\u2019re about to say will be in the context of controlling the microwave. For example, you can hit the button and just say \u201cstop,\u201d and it\u2019ll stop the microwave. (How this is more efficient than just hitting the stop button is unclear.) \n \n The fun feature is the popcorn, though. When you set it up for the first time, you\u2019ll have an option to sign up for a subscription to buy microwave popcorn from Amazon. Then, as you pop it, Alexa will keep track of how many times you have said, \u201cAlexa, make popcorn,\u201d and it\u2019ll reorder automatically when you\u2019re running low. There\u2019s also a popcorn button on the device. \n \n Is all this worth $59.99? Sure, it\u2019s a pretty dead-ahead 700W microwave after all. It\u2019s black and boxy and simple.

The new microwave will come with \"dozens of quick-cook voice presets,\" much like traditional microwaves already offer, except you won't have to lift a finger. \n \n Of course, this isn't the first microwave with Alexa voice control features, other companies like GE, Whirlpool, Kenmore, LG and Samsung have either made or are working on appliances with Amazon's cooking Skill. But this is the first Amazon-branded microwave, meaning it's hardware from the company itself and offers better integration with Alexa.

    "document": "Donald Kravitz via Getty Images Sam Haskell has helped Miss America regain prominence after the institution struggled for several years. But emails tell a different story about his thoughts on the women competing in his pageants. \n \n In late August 2014, the CEO of the Miss America Organization, Sam Haskell, sent an email to the lead writer of the Miss America pageant telecast, Lewis Friedman, informing him of a change he wanted to make in the script: \u201cI have decided that when referring to a woman who was once Miss America, we are no longer going to call them Forever Miss Americas....please change all script copy to reflect that they are Former Miss Americas!\u201d \n \n Friedman replied, \u201cI\u2019d already changed \u201cForevers\u201d to \u201cCunts.\u201d Does that work for you?\u201d \n \n Haskell\u2019s short reply came quickly: \u201cPerfect...bahahaha.\u201d \n \n Supplied \n \n At that point, Haskell had been the leader of Miss America for nine years, after rising through the ranks at a top Hollywood talent agency. Many prior winners, or as they\u2019re called, \u201cformers,\u201d consider the pageant a wonderful, wholesome activity for young women. But Haskell\u2019s behavior behind closed doors shows he regularly maligned, fat-shamed and slut-shamed the former Miss Americas, calling them shocking names and in one case laughing at the suggestion that one of the women should die. \n \n When it came to one particular former, Haskell took his efforts so far that she lost her pageant coaching business. \n \n Getty Images Miss America Organization board members Tammy Haddad, left, and Lynn Weidner. \n \n Two Miss America board members served as a virtual rubber stamp for Haskell\u2019s behavior: Tammy Haddad, a media consultant and D.C. power connector; and Lynn Weidner, a Las Vegas socialite. And though Friedman was never a board member, he regularly sent offensive and sexist messages to Haskell, which Haskell often responded to by indicating he thought Friedman was funny or endorsed what Friedman was saying. \n \n For this story, HuffPost reviewed nearly three years of internal emails provided by two sources. They reveal a CEO who regularly wrote and responded to unprofessional, offensive emails about the women who poured their hearts into the pageants and the organization he was leading. \n \n (Update: The board suspended Haskell on Friday, hours after an open letter from 49 former Miss Americas called for top-level resignations, adding, \u201cThe Board will be conducting an in-depth investigation into alleged inappropriate communications and the nature in which they were obtained. In addition, the Board wishes to reaffirm our commitment to the education and empowerment of young women, supporting them in every way possible.\u201d) \n \n Improving A Struggling American Institution \n \n Sam Haskell joined Miss America\u2019s board in 2005 after retiring from the William Morris Agency (now called WME), where he was the worldwide head of television. \n \n Most everyone agrees that to a certain extent, Haskell helped the organization get back on its feet. Miss America has returned to broadcast television, airing on ABC after being relegated to basic cable. It has also come back to its original home of Atlantic City, New Jersey, from Las Vegas, where the pageant took place in a smaller venue. In 2014, the Miss America Organization and Dick Clark Productions announced a one-year deal (later extended to three years) for the storied entertainment company to produce and cover the cost of the annual pageant telecast, in addition to paying a fee to the Miss America Organization for the rights to produce the telecast. As part of the deal, Dick Clark Productions received two seats on the Miss America Organization board. \n \n Over the past 12 years, Haskell has gone from a board member to a well-compensated CEO. He makes $500,000 a year, which has been a source of internal and external controversy. \n \n But despite his success at growing the pageant, internal emails show a different story. \n \n Michael Loccisano via Getty Images Sam Haskell applauds at the 2018 Miss America event in Atlantic City, New Jersey. \n \n In some cases, Haskell was professional. In an August 2013 email exchange, one month before Mallory Hagan, 2013\u2019s winner, would crown the new Miss America in Atlantic City, Haskell exchanged emails with his daughter and one of his top employees, Brent Adams, about Hagan. \n \n His daughter, Mary Lane, said, \u201cHere\u2019s hoping you get another good one!\u201d \n \n Haskell replied to Mary Lane, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to replace Mallory, but I\u2019m hopeful!\u201d \n \n But in other cases, Haskell and Haddad routinely maligned the former Miss Americas, calling them \u201cmalcontents\u201d and treating them as embarrassing inconveniences rather than honored alumnae. \n \n In May 2014, Haskell forwarded one of Haddad\u2019s emails to a Miss America executive. In it, Haddad had referred to some former Miss Americas as a \u201cpile of malcontents and has beens who blame the program for not getting them where they think they can go.\u201d \n \n She added, \u201c80% of the winners do not have the class, smarts and model for success.\u201d \n \n She then encouraged Haskell to try to avoid getting riled up by the \u201cformers,\u201d saying, \u201cYOU have to let them go. You don\u2019t need them. They need you. We also have to punish them when they don\u2019t appreciate what we do for them.\u201d \n \n In his forward, Haskell called the advice wise. \n \n In response to email questions sent to Haskell and Haddad, HuffPost received a response from a Miss America Organization spokesman. He said Friedman had been let go from the organization after an investigation. \n \n \u201cThe Miss America Organization Board of Directors was notified about the concern of inappropriate language in email communications several months ago. Consequently, the organization\u2019s Board of Directors took the allegations of inappropriate comments very seriously and formed an investigative committee,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs a result of the investigation, the Board directed the organization terminate the relationship with most egregious author of inappropriate comments. In addition, the Board has started the process of instituting additional policies and procedures for communication.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe Board has full confidence in the Miss America Organization leadership team,\u201d he added. \n \n In a reply to an email with questions about his statements, Friedman said, \u201cBefore commenting to correct your information and provide context, I\u2019ll speak to my attorney as this matter is the subject of pending litigation.\u201d It is not clear what litigation he was referencing. \n \n \u2018It Should Have Been Kate Shindle\u2019 \n \n Donna Connor via Getty Images Kate Shindle winning in 1998. \n \n Haskell sometimes focused on Kate Shindle, who was crowned in 1998. The former Miss Illinois is now a successful actor and singer, and serves as president of the Actors\u2019 Equity Association, the union representing more than 51,000 American stage actors and stage managers. \n \n In 2014, Shindle released a book in which she questioned the Miss America board\u2019s decision to pay Haskell a $500,000 consulting fee, during a year the organization was over $400,000 in the red. (The board said the money was back-pay for Haskell.) \n \n Shindle was not revealing new information; press accounts had already exposed the payment. In her book, she also alleged Haskell blacklisted those who dissented against his leadership, with the national organization calling state-level pageants and giving those groups names of people they could not associate with. \n \n In December 2014, Friedman emailed Haskell to offer his condolences on the death of former Miss America Mary Ann Mobley, writing, \u201cSo sorry to hear about Mary Ann Mobley\u201d \n \n The subject line of Friedman\u2019s email read: \u201cIt should have been Kate Shindle.\u201d \n \n Haskell replied, \u201cThanks so much Coach...even in my sadness you can make me laugh...how was the Kennedy Center Honors? Love you and appreciate you! Sam.\u201d \n \n Shindle declined to comment for this article. \n \n \u2018Drive Gretchen Insane\u2019 \n \n Astrid Stawiarz via Getty Images Gretchen Carlson was involved with Miss America for years. \n \n Haskell and Haddad also appeared to dislike Gretchen Carlson, who won the Miss America title in 1989 and was on the organization\u2019s board of directors for many years. The root cause of their disdain, according to three sources, was Carlson\u2019s push to modernize the organization and her refusal to attack former Miss Americas. \n \n Haskell told Carlson not to have Hagan on her program, according to three sources familiar with the conversation. Carlson refused. \n \n On Aug. 15, 2014, Weidner sent an email to a group of former Miss Americas, including Carlson, about Shindle\u2019s book, saying, \u201cIs it possible for each of you to speak out in defense of Sam and the organization?\u201d \n \n Carlson replied, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to talk about your own personal experience as Miss America \u2026 but totally different to attack people individually.\u201d \n \n Haskell forwarded Carlson\u2019s response to Haddad, who replied to Haskell, \u201cSnake but now u have not doubts as to her loyalty. Makes it easy not to respond. Right?\u201d \n \n Just before Shindle\u2019s book came out, Haddad emailed Haskell and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t u read susan POWELL\u2019s [former Miss America] email on the board call and say it\u2019s a shame that only one miss america who has come forward to offer help in any way.\u201d Haddad was referring to an email Powell had written that was supportive of Haskell. \n \n Haskell replied, \u201cBrilliant\u2026..fucking Brilliant!!!! That will drive Gretchen INFUCKINGSANE.\u201d \n \n After the email exchange, Haskell did not feature Carlson in the next Miss America broadcast \u2015 an unusual decision given her prominence. \n \n In a statement sent by email, Haddad said, \u201cI have the highest regard and gratitude for Gretchen and her extraordinary leadership in fighting for women.\u201d \n \n Carlson later resigned from the Miss America board. Haskell and other board members were telling people Carlson couldn\u2019t be trusted, which she felt was maligning her integrity, according to a source familiar with her thinking at the time. \n \n Carlson responded to HuffPost on Thursday, \u201cAs a proud former Miss America and former member of the Board of the Miss America Organization, I am shocked and deeply saddened by the disgusting statements about women attributed to the leadership of the MAO. No woman should be demeaned with such vulgar slurs. As I\u2019ve learned, harassment and shaming of women is never acceptable and should never be tolerated. Every MAO executive and board member who engaged in such crude behavior and signed off on it like it was no big deal should resign immediately. The Miss America Organization, which is tasked to uphold an almost 100 year old tradition of female empowerment and scholarship, deserves better. I hope all former Miss Americas, state and local titleholders and volunteers will join me in a collective effort to fight for the dignity of this great institution.\u201d \n \n In 2016, Carlson rocked the media world when she sued former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes for sexual harassment. Carlson\u2019s suit led to Ailes being pushed out, and she later received a settlement. She has since focused on bringing attention to the epidemic of sexual harassment in the workplace and is working with members of Congress to approve legislation to protect women\u2019s rights in the workplace. \n \n Focused Attacks \n \n Steve Marcus / Reuters Mallory Hagan wins the crown in 2013. \n \n Haskell also appeared to have special disdain for Hagan. In January 2013, she was crowned Miss America at the pageant in Las Vegas. \n \n But just three months later, she was publicly fat-shamed for a bikini photo that surfaced. Haskell said nothing publicly about the images at the time. Later, though, he did internally. \n \n Splash News/Getty Images Hagan was publicly fat-shamed for the photo on the left. The right shows her while competing for Miss America. \n \n As the reigning champion, Hagan spent time in Oxford, Mississippi, at Haskell and his wife\u2019s home. It was there Hagan got to know Adams, whose official title was director of development at Haskell\u2019s production company, which had a television deal with Warner Brothers. Adams essentially acted as a chief of staff, overseeing the various elements of Haskell\u2019s business and personal life, including Miss America. \n \n Adams and Hagan realized they had a connection after spending time together, but, fearful that professional entanglements could complicate a romantic relationship, the two decided if they were going to date it would be best to wait until Hagan\u2019s reign was over. \n \n Shortly after Hagan crowned the new Miss America in September 2013, she and Adams started dating. According to Adams, Haskell wanted Adams to date his daughter, not Hagan, and was open about this request. \n \n Adams recalled an encounter with Haskell at his home in which Haskell attempted to convince Adams to break up with Hagan and instead date his daughter. Haskell stretched out his arms and told Adams, \u201cAll of this can be yours,\u201d ostensibly referring to his Oxford mansion and the family\u2019s money. \n \n \u201cYou don\u2019t need a piece of trash like Mallory. You need someone with class and money like my daughter,\u201d he said, according to Adams. \n \n When Adams was in New York with the Haskell family, Haskell accidentally sent a text message to a group chat that suggested his daughter try to hold Adams\u2019 hand. Adams described the text in a phone interview. \n \n Once, when Hagan made a payment for dinner to Adams via the peer-to-peer payment app Venmo (which shows payments between friends), Haskell confronted Adams about it, asking why he was still in touch with Hagan. \n \n \u2018Are We Four The Only Ones Not To Have Fucked Mallory?\u2019 \n \n In August 2014, Haskell received an email from someone he knew, who said Hagan\u2019s hairdresser in New York had been commenting on Hagan\u2019s sex life while Hagan was living in Los Angeles, as well as her recent weight gain. \n \n Haskell forwarded the email to Friedman saying, \u201cNot a single day passes that I am not told some horrible story about Mallory.\u201d \n \n Friedman replied, \u201cMallory\u2019s preparing for her new career \u2026 as a blimp in the Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Parade As she continues to destroy her own credibility, her voice will attract less and less notice while she continues her descent to an unhappy pathetic footnote.\u201d \n \n Friedman ended the email with, \u201cPs. Are we four the only ones not to have fucked Mallory?\u201d \n \n Haskell replied and said, \u201cIt appears we are the only ones!\u201d \n \n He then wrote Hagan had slept with someone he knew, and he told the man\u2019s mother \u201che needs to have a blood test because we lost count of the number of men she slept with at 25.\u201d \n \n A source close to Hagan says the accusations about her hairdresser and having sex with the man in question are not true. \n \n Supplied \n \n \u2032Why Does He Want That?\u2032 \n \n On Jan. 25, 2015, Weidner sent Haskell a photo of Hagan with three other former Miss Americas. Weidner did not comment on the photo in her email. \n \n Haskell replied, saying, \u201cOMG she is huge...and gross...why does he want that?????\u201d Haskell did not name Adams specifically, but it appears he was discussing his employee, who was still dating Hagan at the time. \n \n Haskell then forwarded the email to Josh Randle, who now serves as president of the Miss America Organization, and added, \u201cLook at MH in this photo...OMG...Why does he want that?\u201d \n \n Randle said, \u201cShe\u2019s a healthy one!! Hahaha.\u201d \n \n Haskill said, \u201cLook at this photo from the Former Retreat!!! Shindle was there too and I was told she made everyone sign an NDA as she rolled out her plan of attack...evil lurks.\u201d \n \n Haddad said, \u201cMallory is barely recognizable\u201d \n \n Haskell said, \u201cIt is unreal.\u201d \n \n Haddad replied, and said, in part, \u201cU think he left u for that? Don\u2019t believe it. It makes NO sense.\u201d \n \n Haskell also forwarded the email to Friedman, who said, \u201cMy screen just cracked! What happened?\u201d \n \n Hagan declined to comment for this article. A Miss America Organization spokesman replied to questions sent to Randle with the same statement he gave for Haskell and Haddad. That statement said Friedman had been let go and the board was instituting new guidelines for internal communication. \n \n Consequences For Hagan \n \n Christian Science Monitor via Getty Images Hagan meets children at a school in 2015. \n \n At the end of December 2015, emails suggest Haskell felt Hagan was personally maligning him. In an email to Haddad, Weidner and Randle, among others, Haskell asked for help, saying Hagan was \u201cviciously and cruelly\u201d attacking him and his family \u201cevery day.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s unclear what Hagan was doing or saying at the time, but a comb of her social media posts doesn\u2019t reveal anything egregious. She continued to be critical of Haskell\u2019s leadership and the direction of the organization, but not in a way that would warrant what was suggested next by Haddad in response to Haskell\u2019s urgent plea. \n \n Haddad said, \u201cHi. I am so sorry. It is ridiculous but she is not going to stop. She has no control. I think u should hire an investigator to get something on her.\u201d \n \n (A source close to Haddad said she was not suggesting in the email that Haskell hire an investigator to dig up something of a personal nature on Hagan. Rather, her intention was to suggest Haskell hire an investigator to see if Hagan had been posting messages anonymously on internal Miss America message boards.) \n \n Haskell said, \u201cThoughts on Tammy\u2019s note below? Threatening her won\u2019t work and we already have \u2018enough info on her\u2019 to shut down Ft. Knox.....ugh. I really think the best way is to shut down her social media, and convince the Formers to ostracize her\u201d \n \n Weidner said, \u201cI wish I had an easy answer to this dilemma. If we can prove a direct connection between MH and specific instances of cyber bullying, we could at least threaten her with a lawsuit right? I do believe that our anti coaching initiatives are already impacting her business. And that our policy of ignoring her is driving her crazy!\u201d \n \n I do believe that our anti coaching initiatives are already impacting her business. an email from Lynn Weidner about Mallory Hagan's pageant coaching business \n \n \u201cI pray none of you ever experience anything like this....It is finally clear that I am on my own,\u201d Haskell replied. \n \n In response to list of questions sent via email, specifically if it was appropriate for nonprofit resources to be used to investigate former Miss Americas, Haddad said in an email, \u201cThis was a terrible, highly divisive time in the Miss America Organization, fueled by inflammatory character attacks. I along with the Board worked to stop the damage that was being inflicted on the organization and members of its community.\u201d \n \n In a statement, Weidner called Haskell \u201cone of the most outstanding individuals I have ever had the pleasure of knowing.\u201d \n \n \u201cSam had led us to becoming a nationally recognized and positive force for the education and the empowerment of young women,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe fact that he would be so ruthlessly attacked by a handful of disgruntled malcontents is disgraceful. I am very proud of the way he has kept above the fray and always conducted himself in a way that does honor to this program.\u201d \n \n Opportunities Lost \n \n Ethan Miller via Getty Images Women compete during the swimsuit portion of the 2007 Miss America pageant. \n \n After winning the pageant, Hagan signed with a WME agent in Los Angeles, Lee White, whom Haskell introduced her to. \n \n But within months, a source close to Hagan says White started to withdraw and decline requests to meet with her. \n \n In one email from White to Haskell described verbally by a source, White suggests he shouldn\u2019t have drinks with Hagan based on something Haskell told him. Haskell replies, saying White made the right judgment. \n \n A few months later, Hagan dropped White as her agent. She moved back to New York and joined a friend training contestants for the all-important interview portion of the pageant. \n \n But within months, the national Miss America Organization told contestants they couldn\u2019t have coaches \u2015 specifically, interview coaches. The national organization also said that anyone wanting to use a coach would have to seek approval from the executive director of their local organization. \n \n The national organization had an informal list of coaches contestants couldn\u2019t use, which contestants found out about through their local and state pageant directors. Hagan was on the list. \n \n Soon after, Hagan\u2019s lucrative coaching business fell apart. \n \n In August 2016, Hagan moved back home to Alabama, where she had to rebuild her career. Today, she is the evening anchor of a small NBC affiliate in Columbus, Georgia. \n \n Cease And Desist \n \n In August 2017, Adams and a former Miss America board member, Regina Hopper, flew to Los Angeles to talk to Dick Clark Productions about Haskell\u2019s behavior. They had copies of egregious emails from Haskell, some of which are included in this article. \n \n The duo expected that Dick Clark Productions, a large entertainment company, would be horrified by the messages. In the meeting, Amy Thurlow and Mark Bracco, both executives at Dick Clark Productions who held the two Miss America board seats, thanked Hopper and Adams for providing the emails and told them Dick Clark Productions would conduct its own investigation. \n \n A month later, Adams received a cease-and-desist letter from a law firm representing the Miss America Organization. It read, \u201cYour deliberate actions constitute a clear violation of the Non-disclosure Agreement you knowingly and willfully entered into\u2026.the letter directed to the Chairman of the Board from Dick Clark Productions, dated September 13, 2017, noticed us of your illegal disclosure of information, which includes several internal email communications.\u201d \n \n The two Dick Clark executives presented the emails to the board, hoping it would lead to a change in leadership, according to two well-placed sources who are familiar with the executives\u2019 thinking at the time. \n \n But, the sources said, no change took place. In fact, last September, knowing full well the kind of language Friedman used in his emails about former Miss Americas, the board allowed him to continue to write for the Miss America pageant telecast. \n \n Based on the board\u2019s refusal to take action in response to the disturbing emails, Dick Clark Productions decided to end its agreement with the Miss America Organization, the sources said. Several prominent Miss America supporters were stunned at the news. The agreement was a lifeline to Miss America \u2015 the production company covered the costs of producing the telecast; paid the Miss America Organization a fee as part of the agreement; and featured, among other things, the current Miss America on the various awards telecasts it produces, like the Billboard Awards. \n \n In a statement Thursday to HuffPost, Dick Clark Productions explained its decision: \u201cSeveral months ago, dick clark productions was made aware of a portion of the emails that were referenced in the December 21 Huffington Post article. We were appalled by their unacceptable content and insisted, in the strongest possible terms, that the Miss America Organization (MAO) board of directors conduct a comprehensive investigation and take appropriate action to address the situation. Shortly thereafter, we resigned our board positions and notified MAO that we were terminating our relationship with them.\u201d \n \n The same prominent Miss America supporters said they found it unfathomable that the board would side with Haskell and Friedman over Dick Clark Productions. \n \n \u2018These Young Women Put Their Heart And Soul Into Being the Best They Can Be\u2019 \n \n Steve Marcus / Reuters Audience members cheer contestants during the 2010 Miss America pageant. \n \n Unsurprisingly, the email that angered the people who spoke to HuffPost for this article the most was the one referring to former Miss Americas as \u201ccunts.\u201d In particular, sources found it offensive that Haskell appeared to think that was funny. \n \n Hopper recounted how she reacted to the email by sharing what she experienced at the last Miss Arkansas pageant, when the reigning Miss America Savvy Shields, who is from the state, made an appearance. \n \n \u201cI sat in the audience and watched her [Miss America] walk out on stage, and the young women and those in the audience all wanted to see and hear her. And that email floated into my head, and tears started running down my face,\u201d she said. \u201cAcross this country, there are parents who are sitting in audiences who put their young daughters into this system with the trust that they\u2019re going to walk away from participating with something good. These young women put their heart and soul into being the best they can be. That the CEO of this organization would agree that word is the perfect characterization of Miss Americas and then laugh \u2015 it\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d \n \n This article has been updated with Haskell\u2019s suspension Friday. ||||| CLOSE CEO Sam Haskell, president and COO Josh Randle and board chairwoman Lynn Weidner have all stepped down after internal emails were published showing Miss America contestants described with vulgar and offensive language.

(Associated Press) \n \n Mourdock, who's been locked in one of the country's most watched Senate races, was asked during the final minutes of a debate with Democratic challenger Rep. Joe Donnelly whether abortion should be allowed in cases of rape or incest. \n \n \"I struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize that life is that gift from God. And, I think, even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen,\" Mourdock said. \n \n Mourdock became the second GOP Senate candidate to find himself on the defensive over comments about rape and pregnancy. Missouri Senate candidate Rep. Todd Akin said during a television interview in August that women's bodies have ways of preventing pregnancy in cases of what he called \"legitimate rape.\" Since his comment, Akin has repeatedly apologized but has refused to leave his race despite calls to do so by leaders of his own party, from GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney on down. \n \n It was not immediately clear what effect Mourdock's comments might have during the final two weeks before the Nov. 6 election. But they could prove problematic. Romney distanced himself from Mourdock on Tuesday night _ a day after a television ad featuring the former Massachusetts governor supporting the GOP Senate candidate began airing in Indiana. \n \n \"Gov. Romney disagrees with Richard Mourdock's comments, and they do not reflect his views,\" Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul said in an email to The Associated Press. Romney aides would not say whether the ad would be pulled and if the Republican presidential nominee would continue to support Mourdock's Senate bid. \n \n Other Republicans did not immediately weigh in. Indiana Republican Party spokesman Pete Seat referred comment to the Mourdock campaign. A spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee and a spokeswoman for Romney did not immediately return a request for comment Tuesday night. \n \n National Democrats quickly picked up on Mourdock's statement and used it as an opportunity to paint him as an extreme candidate, calling him a tea party \"zealot.\" DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz described Mourdock's comments as \"outrageous and demeaning to woman\" and called on Romney to take his pro-Mourdock ad off the air. \n \n Later Tuesday after the debate, Mourdock further explained he did not believe God intended the rape, but that God is the only one who can create life. \n \n \"Are you trying to suggest somehow that God preordained rape, no I don't think that,\" said Mourdock. \"Anyone who would suggest that is just sick and twisted. No, that's not even close to what I said.\" \n \n In response, Donnelly said after the debate in southern Indiana that he doesn't believe \"my God, or any God, would intend that to happen.\" \n \n Along with Romney's ad, top Republicans have been flocking to Indiana as part of an effort to break open the high-stakes race for the Senate seat, currently held by veteran GOP Sen. Richard Lugar who was defeated by Mourdock in the May primary. Republicans need to gain three seats, or four if President Barack Obama wins re-election, and seats that were predicted to remain or turn Republican have grown uncertain. \n \n Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell came to Indianapolis for a fundraiser Monday, and Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham campaigned for Mourdock last week. New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte is due in the state Wednesday. \n \n Romney's coattails carry special significance in deeply conservative Indiana, where Mourdock has underperformed Romney by 12 points in most public polls. Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS also has bought another $1 million of airtime in Indiana, making his group the biggest player in Indiana's Senate race. A message left for Crossroads GPS spokesman Nate Hodson was not immediately returned. ||||| In a Tuesday night debate with his Democratic rival and a Libertarian candidate for one of Indiana's U.S. Senate seats, Republican candidate Richard Mourdock suggested that pregnancies resulting from rape are \"something that God intended to happen,\" despite the \"horrible situation\" from which they derived. \n \n Mourdock, a Tea Party-backed candidate who beat longtime moderate Senator Richard Lugar in the state's Republican nominating contest earlier this year, expressed his view that \"life begins at conception\" and that he would only allow abortions in circumstances in which the mother's life was in danger. \n \n \"I struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize life is that gift from God,\" Mourdock said. \"And I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\" \n \n Democrats immediately pounced on his comments, and Donnelly -- who is also pro-life but who supports exceptions for rape and incest -- released a statement questioning the notion that God would \"intend for rape to happen.\" \n \n \"The God I believe in and the God I know most Hoosiers believe in, does not intend for rape to happen -- ever,\" Donnelly said. \"What Mr. Mourdock said is shocking, and it is stunning that he would be so disrespectful to survivors of rape.\" \n \n Mourdock, seeking to clarify his comments in a press conference following the debate, said he had intended to say that \"God creates life,\" and that any interpretation of his comments to mean God \"pre-ordained rape\" were \"sick\" and \"twisted.\" \n \n \"What I said was, in answering the question form my position of faith, I said I believe that God creates life. I believe that as wholly and as fully as I can believe it. That God creates life,\" Mourdock said. \"Are you trying to suggest that somehow I think that God pre-ordained rape? No, I don't think that. That's sick. Twisted. That's not even close to what I said. What I said is that God creates life.\" \n \n While to the right on Lugar with regard to issues relating both to reproductive rights and others, Mourdock's stance on abortion is hardly an anomaly in the Republican party. His comments echo similar remarks made by former Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum, a staunch pro-life social conservative, while he was still in the midst of a bid for the White House. \n \n \"I think the right approach is to accept this horribly created -- in the sense of rape -- but nevertheless a gift in a very broken way, the gift of human life, and accept what God has given to you,\" Santorum told CNN's Piers Morgan in January. \"We have to make the best of a bad situation.\" \n \n At the GOP convention in Tampa this year, the party approved a platform with language calling for a constitutional amendment banning abortion. The language, which is the same as in the party's 2004 and 2008 platform, did not provide exceptions for victims of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother. \n \n Mourdock isn't the first Republican Senate candidate this cycle to inspire headlines about comments relating to rape and abortion. Todd Akin, Missouri's embattled Republican Senate candidate, was rebuked even by his own party when he suggested that pregnancies resulting from what he called \"legitimate rape\" were \"really rare.\" \n \n Akin's comments were roundly decried by Democrats and Republicans alike, and a spokesperson for the Romney campaign said that Romney and Ryan \"disagree\" with Akin's statement. \n \n Romney, who has endorsed Mourdock, recently appeared in a campaign video on behalf of Mourdock, and campaigned with him in Evansville, Indiana, on Aug. 4. Paul Ryan, who, like Mourdock, opposes all abortions except to save the life of the mother, appeared at an open press funder with him on Sept. 17. Romney opposes abortion with exceptions for the victims of rape and incest and if the life of the mother is at risk. \n \n In a statement released Tuesday night, Romney spokesperson Andrea Saul said Mourdock's remarks were not in line with Romney's views. \n \n \"Gov. Romney disagrees with Richard Mourdock's comments, and they do not reflect his views,\" Saul said. \n \n",

As these closures have mounted, advocates in the state have worried that the decline in abortion access could lead to a rise in the number of women trying to terminate pregnancies by themselves. \n \n A new study quantifies some of those fears: At least 100,000 Texas women\u2014and as many as 240,000\u2014between the ages of 18 and 49 have attempted to self-induce abortions, according to a report released today by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project (TxPEP). The study also found that it is possible that the rate of women attempting to self-induce abortions is rising in Texas as a result of the state\u2019s additional restrictions on abortion care. The report points to previous studies that have explored the correlation between a rise in abortion restrictions and the prevalence of self-induced abortions. A 2008 national study found that about 2 percent of women reported that they tried to terminate pregnancies on their own. In 2012, a year after Texas passed several new abortion restrictions, a study of Texas women seeking care at an abortion clinic found that about 7 percent reported attempting to end their pregnancies without medical assistance before seeking clinic care. \n \n \u201cThis is the latest body of evidence demonstrating the negative implications of laws like HB2 that pretend to protect women but in reality place them, and particularly women of color and economically disadvantaged women, at significant risk,\u201d said Dr. Daniel Grossman, one of the study\u2019s co-authors and a professor in the department of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California-San Francisco, in a press call Tuesday morning. \n \n Amy Hagstrom Miller, the president and CEO of Whole Woman\u2019s Health, an independent abortion provider in Texas and the lead plaintiff in the HB2 case currently before the Supreme Court, reiterated that Texas has seen a rise in self-induced abortions since abortion restrictions like HB2, and that terminating a pregnancy with DIY methods is not healthy for women. \u201cNobody should be denied safe and compassionate care based on her zip code,\u201d said Hagstrom Miller. \u201cBut that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s been happening. \n \n These findings come from a survey of nearly 800 women, ages 18 to 49, conducted by TxPEP over two months in 2014 and 2015. The women were asked if they knew or suspected that their best friend had ever self-induced an abortion, and if they\u2019d ever done so themselves. Overall, 1.7 percent of respondents said they had tried to self-induce an abortion, while 4.1 percent of women said they knew or suspected their best friend had done so. Applying these proportions to the nearly 6 million women of reproductive age in Texas, the researchers concluded that an estimated 100,000 to 240,000 Texas women ages 18-49 have attempted to end a pregnancy alone. \n \n The study identifies two populations where histories of self-induced abortion were most prevalent: Latina women living in a county that borders Mexico\u2014a more rural area of the state that has seen several clinic closures\u2014and women who reported difficulty gaining access to reproductive health care in the past. \n \n The study also determined that the two broad categories of methods used by women to end their pregnancies were home remedies such as herbs, teas, vitamins, or medications\u2014primarily misoprostol\u2014obtained in Mexico without a prescription by women traveling there. \n \n Typically, a medication abortion in the United States requires that two drugs\u2014misoprostol and mifepristone\u2014be taken about 24 hours apart. But most doctors say misoprostol alone can be an effective way to induce an abortion if the combined regimen is not available. Most of the women who reported obtaining misoprostol had a complete abortion after using the drug, but used different doses and methods of administration. Many reported intense symptoms throughout the abortion\u2014intense cramping and bleeding, for instance\u2014and some talked about being unsure whether these symptoms were normal or healthy. \n \n Most women cited one or more of four reasons for choosing to self-induce: They lacked the money to travel and/or pay for the procedure; their local clinic had closed; a close friend or family member had recommended self-induction; or the women feared the stigma associated with going to an abortion clinic. \n \n But Grossman pointed out that among these specific reasons, \u201ca common layer was that poverty layered on one or more of these obstacles led women to self-induce.\u201d ||||| A BILL TO BE ENTITLED \n \n AN ACT \n \n relating to the regulation of abortion procedures, providers, and \n \n facilities; providing penalties. \n \n BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS: \n \n SECTION 1. (a) The findings indicate that: \n \n (1) substantial medical evidence recognizes that an \n \n unborn child is capable of experiencing pain by not later than 20 \n \n weeks after fertilization; \n \n (2) the state has a compelling state interest in \n \n protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which \n \n substantial medical evidence indicates that these children are \n \n capable of feeling pain; \n \n (3) the compelling state interest in protecting the \n \n lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial \n \n medical evidence indicates that an unborn child is capable of \n \n feeling pain is intended to be separate from and independent of the \n \n compelling state interest in protecting the lives of unborn \n \n children from the stage of viability, and neither state interest is \n \n intended to replace the other; and \n \n (4) restricting elective abortions at or later than 20 \n \n weeks post-fertilization, as provided by this Act, does not impose \n \n an undue burden or a substantial obstacle on a woman's ability to \n \n have an abortion because: \n \n (A) the woman has adequate time to decide whether \n \n to have an abortion in the first 20 weeks after fertilization; and \n \n (B) this Act does not apply to abortions that are \n \n necessary to avert the death or substantial and irreversible \n \n physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant \n \n woman or abortions that are performed on unborn children with \n \n severe fetal abnormalities. \n \n (b) The legislature intends that every application of this \n \n statute to every individual woman shall be severable from each \n \n other. In the unexpected event that the application of this statute \n \n is found to impose an impermissible undue burden on any pregnant \n \n woman or group of pregnant women, the application of the statute to \n \n those women shall be severed from the remaining applications of the \n \n statute that do not impose an undue burden, and those remaining \n \n applications shall remain in force and unaffected, consistent with \n \n Section 10 of this Act. \n \n SECTION 2. Subchapter A, Chapter 171, Health and Safety \n \n Code, is amended by adding Section 171.0031 to read as follows: \n \n Sec. 171.0031. REQUIREMENTS OF PHYSICIAN; OFFENSE. (a) A \n \n physician performing or inducing an abortion: \n \n (1) must, on the date the abortion is performed or \n \n induced, have active admitting privileges at a hospital that: \n \n (A) is located not further than 30 miles from the \n \n location at which the abortion is performed or induced; and \n \n (B) provides obstetrical or gynecological health \n \n care services; and \n \n (2) shall provide the pregnant woman with: \n \n (A) a telephone number by which the pregnant \n \n woman may reach the physician, or other health care personnel \n \n employed by the physician or by the facility at which the abortion \n \n was performed or induced with access to the woman's relevant \n \n medical records, 24 hours a day to request assistance for any \n \n complications that arise from the performance or induction of the \n \n abortion or ask health-related questions regarding the abortion; \n \n and \n \n (B) the name and telephone number of the nearest \n \n hospital to the home of the pregnant woman at which an emergency \n \n arising from the abortion would be treated. \n \n (b) A physician who violates Subsection (a) commits an \n \n offense. An offense under this section is a Class A misdemeanor \n \n punishable by a fine only, not to exceed $4,000. \n \n SECTION 3. Chapter 171, Health and Safety Code, is amended \n \n by adding Subchapters C and D to read as follows: \n \n SUBCHAPTER C. ABORTION PROHIBITED AT OR AFTER 20 WEEKS \n \n POST-FERTILIZATION \n \n Sec. 171.041. SHORT TITLE. This subchapter may be cited as \n \n the Preborn Pain Act. \n \n Sec. 171.042. DEFINITIONS. In this subchapter: \n \n (1) \"Post-fertilization age\" means the age of the \n \n unborn child as calculated from the fusion of a human spermatozoon \n \n with a human ovum. \n \n (2) \"Severe fetal abnormality\" has the meaning \n \n assigned by Section 285.202. \n \n Sec. 171.043. DETERMINATION OF POST-FERTILIZATION AGE \n \n REQUIRED. Except as otherwise provided by Section 171.046, a \n \n physician may not perform or induce or attempt to perform or induce \n \n an abortion without, prior to the procedure: \n \n (1) making a determination of the probable \n \n post-fertilization age of the unborn child; or \n \n (2) possessing and relying on a determination of the \n \n probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child made by another \n \n physician. \n \n Sec. 171.044. ABORTION OF UNBORN CHILD OF 20 OR MORE WEEKS \n \n POST-FERTILIZATION AGE PROHIBITED. Except as otherwise provided by \n \n Section 171.046, a person may not perform or induce or attempt to \n \n perform or induce an abortion on a woman if it has been determined, \n \n by the physician performing, inducing, or attempting to perform or \n \n induce the abortion or by another physician on whose determination \n \n that physician relies, that the probable post-fertilization age of \n \n the unborn child is 20 or more weeks. \n \n Sec. 171.045. METHOD OF ABORTION. (a) This section \n \n applies only to an abortion authorized under Section 171.046(a)(1) \n \n or (2) in which: \n \n (1) the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn \n \n child is 20 or more weeks; or \n \n (2) the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn \n \n child has not been determined but could reasonably be 20 or more \n \n weeks. \n \n (b) Except as otherwise provided by Section 171.046(a)(3), \n \n a physician performing an abortion under Subsection (a) shall \n \n terminate the pregnancy in the manner that, in the physician's \n \n reasonable medical judgment, provides the best opportunity for the \n \n unborn child to survive. \n \n Sec. 171.046. EXCEPTIONS. (a) The prohibitions and \n \n requirements under Sections 171.043, 171.044, and 171.045(b) do not \n \n apply to an abortion performed if there exists a condition that, in \n \n the physician's reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the \n \n medical condition of the woman that, to avert the woman's death or a \n \n serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of \n \n a major bodily function, other than a psychological condition, it \n \n necessitates, as applicable: \n \n (1) the immediate abortion of her pregnancy without \n \n the delay necessary to determine the probable post-fertilization \n \n age of the unborn child; \n \n (2) the abortion of her pregnancy even though the \n \n post-fertilization age of the unborn child is 20 or more weeks; or \n \n (3) the use of a method of abortion other than a method \n \n described by Section 171.045(b). \n \n (b) A physician may not take an action authorized under \n \n Subsection (a) if the risk of death or a substantial and \n \n irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function arises \n \n from a claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct that \n \n may result in her death or in substantial and irreversible physical \n \n impairment of a major bodily function. \n \n (c) The prohibitions and requirements under Sections \n \n 171.043, 171.044, and 171.045(b) do not apply to an abortion \n \n performed on an unborn child who has a severe fetal abnormality. \n \n Sec. 171.047. PROTECTION OF PRIVACY IN COURT PROCEEDINGS. \n \n (a) Except as otherwise provided by this section, in a civil or \n \n criminal proceeding or action involving an act prohibited under \n \n this subchapter, the identity of the woman on whom an abortion has \n \n been performed or induced or attempted to be performed or induced is \n \n not subject to public disclosure if the woman does not give consent \n \n to disclosure. \n \n (b) Unless the court makes a ruling under Subsection (c) to \n \n allow disclosure of the woman's identity, the court shall issue \n \n orders to the parties, witnesses, and counsel and shall direct the \n \n sealing of the record and exclusion of individuals from courtrooms \n \n or hearing rooms to the extent necessary to protect the woman's \n \n identity from public disclosure. \n \n (c) A court may order the disclosure of information that is \n \n confidential under this section if: \n \n (1) a motion is filed with the court requesting \n \n release of the information and a hearing on that request; \n \n (2) notice of the hearing is served on each interested \n \n party; and \n \n (3) the court determines after the hearing and an in \n \n camera review that disclosure is essential to the administration of \n \n justice and there is no reasonable alternative to disclosure. \n \n Sec. 171.048. CONSTRUCTION OF SUBCHAPTER. (a) This \n \n subchapter shall be construed, as a matter of state law, to be \n \n enforceable up to but no further than the maximum possible extent \n \n consistent with federal constitutional requirements, even if that \n \n construction is not readily apparent, as such constructions are \n \n authorized only to the extent necessary to save the subchapter from \n \n judicial invalidation. Judicial reformation of statutory language \n \n is explicitly authorized only to the extent necessary to save the \n \n statutory provision from invalidity. \n \n (b) If any court determines that a provision of this \n \n subchapter is unconstitutionally vague, the court shall interpret \n \n the provision, as a matter of state law, to avoid the vagueness \n \n problem and shall enforce the provision to the maximum possible \n \n extent. If a federal court finds any provision of this subchapter \n \n or its application to any person, group of persons, or \n \n circumstances to be unconstitutionally vague and declines to impose \n \n the saving construction described by this subsection, the Supreme \n \n Court of Texas shall provide an authoritative construction of the \n \n objectionable statutory provisions that avoids the constitutional \n \n problems while enforcing the statute's restrictions to the maximum \n \n possible extent, and shall agree to answer any question certified \n \n from a federal appellate court regarding the statute. \n \n (c) A state executive or administrative official may not \n \n decline to enforce this subchapter, or adopt a construction of this \n \n subchapter in a way that narrows its applicability, based on the \n \n official's own beliefs about what the state or federal constitution \n \n requires, unless the official is enjoined by a state or federal \n \n court from enforcing this subchapter. \n \n (d) This subchapter may not be construed to authorize the \n \n prosecution of or a cause of action to be brought against a woman on \n \n whom an abortion is performed or induced or attempted to be \n \n performed or induced in violation of this subchapter. \n \n SUBCHAPTER D. ABORTION-INDUCING DRUGS \n \n Sec. 171.061. DEFINITIONS. In this subchapter: \n \n (1) \"Abortion\" means the act of using, administering, \n \n prescribing, or otherwise providing an instrument, a drug, a \n \n medicine, or any other substance, device, or means with the intent \n \n to terminate a clinically diagnosable pregnancy of a woman and with \n \n knowledge that the termination by those means will, with reasonable \n \n likelihood, cause the death of the woman's unborn child. An act is \n \n not an abortion if the act is done with the intent to: \n \n (A) save the life or preserve the health of an \n \n unborn child; \n \n (B) remove a dead, unborn child whose death was \n \n caused by spontaneous abortion; \n \n (C) remove an ectopic pregnancy; or \n \n (D) treat a maternal disease or illness for which \n \n a prescribed drug, medicine, or other substance is indicated. \n \n (2) \"Abortion-inducing drug\" means a drug, a medicine, \n \n or any other substance, including a regimen of two or more drugs, \n \n medicines, or substances, prescribed, dispensed, or administered \n \n with the intent of terminating a clinically diagnosable pregnancy \n \n of a woman and with knowledge that the termination will, with \n \n reasonable likelihood, cause the death of the woman's unborn child. \n \n The term includes off-label use of drugs, medicines, or other \n \n substances known to have abortion-inducing properties that are \n \n prescribed, dispensed, or administered with the intent of causing \n \n an abortion, including the Mifeprex regimen.

DISTRIBUTION OF ABORTION-INDUCING DRUG. \n \n (a) A person may not knowingly give, sell, dispense, administer, \n \n provide, or prescribe an abortion-inducing drug to a pregnant woman \n \n for the purpose of inducing an abortion in the pregnant woman or \n \n enabling another person to induce an abortion in the pregnant woman \n \n unless: \n \n (1) the person who gives, sells, dispenses, \n \n administers, provides, or prescribes the abortion-inducing drug is \n \n a physician; and \n \n (2) except as otherwise provided by Subsection (b), \n \n the provision, prescription, or administration of the \n \n abortion-inducing drug satisfies the protocol tested and \n \n authorized by the United States Food and Drug Administration as \n \n outlined in the final printed label of the abortion-inducing drug. \n \n (b) A person may provide, prescribe, or administer the \n \n abortion-inducing drug in the dosage amount prescribed by the \n \n clinical management guidelines defined by the American Congress of \n \n Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin as those \n \n guidelines existed on January 1, 2013. \n \n (c) Before the physician gives, sells, dispenses, \n \n administers, provides, or prescribes an abortion-inducing drug, \n \n the physician must examine the pregnant woman and document, in the \n \n woman's medical record, the gestational age and intrauterine \n \n location of the pregnancy. \n \n (d) The physician who gives, sells, dispenses, administers, \n \n provides, or prescribes an abortion-inducing drug shall provide the \n \n pregnant woman with: \n \n (1) a copy of the final printed label of that \n \n abortion-inducing drug; and \n \n (2) a telephone number by which the pregnant woman may \n \n reach the physician, or other health care personnel employed by the \n \n physician or by the facility at which the abortion was performed \n \n with access to the woman's relevant medical records, 24 hours a day \n \n to request assistance for any complications that arise from the \n \n administration or use of the drug or ask health-related questions \n \n regarding the administration or use of the drug. \n \n (e) The physician who gives, sells, dispenses, administers, \n \n provides, or prescribes the abortion-inducing drug, or the \n \n physician's agent, must schedule a follow-up visit for the woman to \n \n occur not more than 14 days after the administration or use of the \n \n drug. At the follow-up visit, the physician must: \n \n (1) confirm that the pregnancy is completely \n \n terminated; and \n \n (2) assess the degree of bleeding. \n \n (f) The physician who gives, sells, dispenses, administers, \n \n provides, or prescribes the abortion-inducing drug, or the \n \n physician's agent, shall make a reasonable effort to ensure that \n \n the woman returns for the scheduled follow-up visit under \n \n Subsection (e). The physician or the physician's agent shall \n \n document a brief description of any effort made to comply with this \n \n subsection, including the date, time, and name of the person making \n \n the effort, in the woman's medical record. \n \n (g) If a physician gives, sells, dispenses, administers, \n \n provides, or prescribes an abortion-inducing drug to a pregnant \n \n woman for the purpose of inducing an abortion as authorized by this \n \n section and the physician knows that the woman experiences a \n \n serious adverse event, as defined by the MedWatch Reporting System, \n \n during or after the administration or use of the drug, the physician \n \n shall report the event to the United States Food and Drug \n \n Administration through the MedWatch Reporting System not later than \n \n the third day after the date the physician learns that the event \n \n occurred. \n \n Sec. 171.064. ADMINISTRATIVE PENALTY. (a) The Texas \n \n Medical Board may take disciplinary action under Chapter 164, \n \n Occupations Code, or assess an administrative penalty under \n \n Subchapter A, Chapter 165, Occupations Code, against a person who \n \n violates Section 171.063. \n \n (b) A penalty may not be assessed under this section against \n \n a pregnant woman who receives a medical abortion. \n \n SECTION 4. Section 245.010(a), Health and Safety Code, is \n \n amended to read as follows: \n \n (a) The rules must contain minimum standards to protect the \n \n health and safety of a patient of an abortion facility and must \n \n contain provisions requiring compliance with the requirements of \n \n Subchapter B, Chapter 171. On and after September 1, 2014, the \n \n minimum standards for an abortion facility must be equivalent to \n \n the minimum standards adopted under Section 243.010 for ambulatory \n \n surgical centers. \n \n SECTION 5. Section 245.011(c), Health and Safety Code, is \n \n amended to read as follows: \n \n (c) The report must include: \n \n (1) whether the abortion facility at which the \n \n abortion is performed is licensed under this chapter; \n \n (2) the patient's year of birth, race, marital status, \n \n and state and county of residence; \n \n (3) the type of abortion procedure; \n \n (4) the date the abortion was performed; \n \n (5) whether the patient survived the abortion, and if \n \n the patient did not survive, the cause of death; \n \n (6) the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn \n \n child [ period of gestation ] based on the best medical judgment of \n \n the attending physician at the time of the procedure; \n \n (7) the date, if known, of the patient's last menstrual \n \n cycle; \n \n (8) the number of previous live births of the patient; \n \n and \n \n (9) the number of previous induced abortions of the \n \n patient. \n \n SECTION 6. Section 164.052(a), Occupations Code, is amended \n \n to read as follows: \n \n (a) A physician or an applicant for a license to practice \n \n medicine commits a prohibited practice if that person: \n \n (1) submits to the board a false or misleading \n \n statement, document, or certificate in an application for a \n \n license; \n \n (2) presents to the board a license, certificate, or \n \n diploma that was illegally or fraudulently obtained; \n \n (3) commits fraud or deception in taking or passing an \n \n examination; \n \n (4) uses alcohol or drugs in an intemperate manner \n \n that, in the board's opinion, could endanger a patient's life; \n \n (5) commits unprofessional or dishonorable conduct \n \n that is likely to deceive or defraud the public, as provided by \n \n Section 164.053, or injure the public; \n \n (6) uses an advertising statement that is false, \n \n misleading, or deceptive; \n \n (7) advertises professional superiority or the \n \n performance of professional service in a superior manner if that \n \n advertising is not readily subject to verification; \n \n (8) purchases, sells, barters, or uses, or offers to \n \n purchase, sell, barter, or use, a medical degree, license, \n \n certificate, or diploma, or a transcript of a license, certificate, \n \n or diploma in or incident to an application to the board for a \n \n license to practice medicine; \n \n (9) alters, with fraudulent intent, a medical license, \n \n certificate, or diploma, or a transcript of a medical license, \n \n certificate, or diploma; \n \n (10) uses a medical license, certificate, or diploma, \n \n or a transcript of a medical license, certificate, or diploma that \n \n has been: \n \n (A) fraudulently purchased or issued; \n \n (B) counterfeited; or \n \n (C) materially altered; \n \n (11) impersonates or acts as proxy for another person \n \n in an examination required by this subtitle for a medical license; \n \n (12) engages in conduct that subverts or attempts to \n \n subvert an examination process required by this subtitle for a \n \n medical license; \n \n (13) impersonates a physician or permits another to \n \n use the person's license or certificate to practice medicine in \n \n this state; \n \n (14) directly or indirectly employs a person whose \n \n license to practice medicine has been suspended, canceled, or \n \n revoked; \n \n (15) associates in the practice of medicine with a \n \n person: \n \n (A) whose license to practice medicine has been \n \n suspended, canceled, or revoked; or \n \n (B) who has been convicted of the unlawful \n \n practice of medicine in this state or elsewhere; \n \n (16) performs or procures a criminal abortion, aids or \n \n abets in the procuring of a criminal abortion, attempts to perform \n \n or procure a criminal abortion, or attempts to aid or abet the \n \n performance or procurement of a criminal abortion; \n \n (17) directly or indirectly aids or abets the practice \n \n of medicine by a person, partnership, association, or corporation \n \n that is not licensed to practice medicine by the board; \n \n (18) performs an abortion on a woman who is pregnant \n \n with a viable unborn child during the third trimester of the \n \n pregnancy unless: \n \n (A) the abortion is necessary to prevent the \n \n death of the woman; \n \n (B) the viable unborn child has a severe, \n \n irreversible brain impairment; or \n \n (C) the woman is diagnosed with a significant \n \n likelihood of suffering imminent severe, irreversible brain damage \n \n or imminent severe, irreversible paralysis; [ or ] \n \n (19) performs an abortion on an unemancipated minor \n \n without the written consent of the child's parent, managing \n \n conservator, or legal guardian or without a court order, as \n \n provided by Section 33.003 or 33.004, Family Code, authorizing the \n \n minor to consent to the abortion, unless the physician concludes \n \n that on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, a \n \n condition exists that complicates the medical condition of the \n \n pregnant minor and necessitates the immediate abortion of her \n \n pregnancy to avert her death or to avoid a serious risk of \n \n substantial impairment of a major bodily function and that there is \n \n insufficient time to obtain the consent of the child's parent, \n \n managing conservator, or legal guardian ; or \n \n (20) performs or induces or attempts to perform or \n \n induce an abortion in violation of Subchapter C, Chapter 171, \n \n Health and Safety Code . \n \n SECTION 7.

Effective September 1, 2014, Section 245.010(c), \n \n Health and Safety Code, is repealed. \n \n SECTION 9. This Act may not be construed to repeal, by \n \n implication or otherwise, Section 164.052(a)(18), Occupations \n \n Code, Section 170.002, Health and Safety Code, or any other \n \n provision of Texas law regulating or restricting abortion not \n \n specifically addressed by this Act. An abortion that complies with \n \n this Act but violates any other law is unlawful. An abortion that \n \n complies with another state law but violates this Act is unlawful as \n \n provided in this Act. \n \n SECTION 10. (a) If some or all of the provisions of this \n \n Act are ever temporarily or permanently restrained or enjoined by \n \n judicial order, all other provisions of Texas law regulating or \n \n restricting abortion shall be enforced as though the restrained or \n \n enjoined provisions had not been adopted; provided, however, that \n \n whenever the temporary or permanent restraining order or injunction \n \n is stayed or dissolved, or otherwise ceases to have effect, the \n \n provisions shall have full force and effect. \n \n (b) Mindful of Leavitt v. Jane L. , 518 U.S. 137 (1996), in \n \n which in the context of determining the severability of a state \n \n statute regulating abortion the United States Supreme Court held \n \n that an explicit statement of legislative intent is controlling, it \n \n is the intent of the legislature that every provision, section, \n \n subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in this Act, and \n \n every application of the provisions in this Act, are severable from \n \n each other.

I don't really know what I'm doing.\" This interview with a 24-year-old Texas woman, part of a University of Texas report on reproductive legislation released Tuesday, underscores the measures women in the Lone Star State are taking as access to abortion facilities is restricted, the Guardian reports. Findings of the Texas Policy Evaluation Project are startling: Between 100,000 and 240,000 Texan women ages 18 to 49 have taken matters into their own hands and tried to induce an abortion at home, with, as the Guardian puts it, \"varying degrees of success and differing medical consequences.\" The report asked an online sample of 779 women if they or their best friends had ever tried to self-induce an abortion, with 1.7% saying they had and 4.1% saying their best friend had or they suspected she had, the Atlantic reports. Extrapolating those figures to the nearly 6 million women of reproductive age in Texas is how researchers came to the final numbers, Mother Jones notes. In terms of methods used to attempt an abortion, the drug misoprostol was the most commonly cited, with others including \"herbs or homeopathic remedies,\" alcohol, illegal drugs, hormonal pills, and \"getting hit or punched in the abdomen,\" per the Atlantic. Texas restrictions on abortions are among the strictest in the US: The 2013 HB2 law has shut more than half the state's 41 abortion clinics. The CEO of a gynecology and abortion care organization tells the Guardian that the result is \"tremendously disrespectful. Abortion is legal in this country,\" she says. \"And so every woman deserves to have access to whatever method for terminating her pregnancy safely she might choose in her local community.\" (The Supreme Court will hear arguments over a provision that could leave just 10 or so abortion clinics open in Texas.)",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 At least 100,000 women in Texas between the ages of 18 and 49 have attempted to end their pregnancies by themselves since the state passed HB2 in 2013, according to a study released Tuesday by the Texas Policy Evaluation Project. The study found that 1.7% of women knew or suspected their best friend had self-induced an abortion, while 4.1% of women said they knew or suspected their best friend had done so. The study\u2014based on a survey of nearly 800 women between the ages of 18 and 49 conducted over two months in 2014 and 2015\u2014finds self-induced abortions are most prevalent in Latina women living in a county that borders Mexico, as well as women who have struggled to gain access to reproductive health care in the past. \"This is the latest body of evidence demonstrating the negative implications of laws like HB2 that pretend to protect women but in reality place them, and particularly women of color and economically disadvantaged women, at significant risk,\" one of the study's co-authors says in a press call, per Mother Jones. The study found that among the reasons women cited for attempting to end their pregnancies on their own: They lacked the money to travel and/or pay for the procedure; their local clinic had closed; a close friend or family member had recommended self-induction; or the women feared the stigma associated with going to an abortion clinic. Most women who reported attempting to end their pregnancies with misoprostol\u2014obtained in Mexico without a prescription\u2014used different doses and methods of the drug, but most often with intense cramping and bleeding. The study also found that women who attempted to end a pregnancy with mifepristone or mifepristone were more likely to attempt to attempt to get the drug, which can cause pain, which can be expelled, if caught, or if one or if one or if a person could be caught.

That's because her first was born on Aug, 8, 2008, her second on Sept. 9, 2009 and her most recent on Oct. 10, 2010. Yes, that's 8-8-08, 9-9-09 and 10-10-10. The Rockford, Mich., mom and husband Chad weren't thinking about dates when their children were born. Their doctor had to give drugs to start labor for the couple's first daughter, Chloe Corrin Soper, who was born full term on Aug. 8 at Spectrum Health's Butterworth Hospital in Grand Rapids, Mich. Their son was a surprise all around. \"He wasn't a planned baby at all, he was a miracle,\" says Barbara Soper. He was due on Sept. 20, 2009, but because sister Chloe's birth had caused some hemorrhaging, their doctor, Andrew Van Slooten, suggested he come out a little early so he'd be smaller. Soper was started on drugs to induce labor on Sept. 8, but it took 24 hours before Cameron Dane Soper made his way into the world, arriving on 9-9-09. Soper says she and her husband had thought it would be \"neat\" if their third child was born on 10-10-10 but because her due date wasn't until Nov. 4, it seemed unlikely. But it ended up being \"kind of a mandatory eviction,\" says Soper. She developed blood clots in her legs and three weeks before her due date doctors told her the baby needed to be delivered. The induction was begun on 10-9-10, but it wasn't until 6:53 on Sunday night, 10-10-10, that Cearra Nicole Soper arrived. Despite being three weeks early, \"she's feeding well,\" says mom. \"She's a trooper.\" While the dates might seem \"incredibly rare,\" they're really not. Such a lineup can only happen in the first 12 years of the century and at least 10 months apart, says Shannon McWeeney, a professor of biostatistics at the Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland. \"Given that the first birth occurred in that window, the probability is not as astronomical as you might be compelled to think,\" she says.In fact, it's not that high a number at all, says Philip Stark, a professor of statistics at the University of California, Berkeley. \"The 'chance' you get depends on the assumptions you make,\" he says. One set of assumptions gives a chance of about 1 in 50 million. More realistic assumptions \u2014 including allowing at least 11 months between births \u2014 increases it to about 1 in 2,500. Since thousands of women in the United States had kids in 2008, 2009 and 2010, this suddenly seems a little less extraordinary. But humans \"like to look for patterns, to make sense of things\" he says.For the Sopers, three is simply their lucky number \u2014 \"we don't have any more planned,\" says Barbara.

That's because it was the third baby for the Soper family born on a numerical anomaly. \n \n Baby number one came on 8-8-08. Baby number two came on 9-9-09, and, yes, Sunday was 10-10-10. \n \n It's an almost impossibly cool coincidence -- especially when you consider her third baby wasn't due until November of this year but came early, and she didn't schedule C-sections with any of the kids. \n \n But let's do a little math of our own here, shall we? \n \n Barbara Soper has been either pregnant or recovering from giving birth since late 2007. It is now late 2010. \n \n Can we send her some condolence cards along with those congratulatory bouquets? \n \n Many women who have had their kids in quick succession tout the advantages to getting their childbearing over in one fell swoop: having little to no break in between the kids means they're closer in age and can play with each other on almost the same level; once you potty train one you can start the next one and escape the diaper stage faster; and of course you don't have the \"lost baby weight, now I'm pregnant again\" conundrum. \n \n But there's a reason doctors discourage the practice. \n \n Pregnancy and childbirth both do a number on the body -- especially the uterus, your baby's house for the next nine months. It takes a minimum of six weeks after delivery to return to its normal size, but it still needs time to recover to again be a hospitable home for a fetus. \n \n New studies have likewise found women really DO need to lose that baby weight before embarking on a new pregnancy. As counter-intuitive as it sounds, there's less strain on the body (and less risk to the fetus) if your body has gone back down to a healthy weight before the next pregnancy begins. \n \n Add to that, if you're planning to nurse your kids for longer than nine months, it's possible to do it -- but it's needlessly complicated when babies are born one on top of another. \n \n Barbara and Chad Soper say she never planned for this to happen. Her son was a surprise pregnancy, and her second and third children were born earlier than their due dates -- she was due on September 20, 2009 with Cameron, who was born September 9, and little Cearra born this month was actually due November 4. \n \n Congrats to the family on their mathematical surprises! \n \n Does anyone have tips for them on three kids under 3? \n \n Image via Spectrum Health \n \n \n \n",

This seems to be what happened with Forbes.com on Sunday when it declared Mitt Romney had exited the Republican presidential race. \n \n An April Fools\u2019 prank at Forbes went awry when a blog claimed Mitt Romney, right, had stepped down and backed former senator Rick Santorum as the GOP presidential nominee. (Jae C. Hong/AP) \n \n Contributor Len Burman wrote and published a blog on the news organization\u2019s Web site headlined \u201cRomney drops out of race, endorses Santorum,\u201d about 10:40 Sunday morning. Editors pulled it down about a half-hour later, but not before the \u201cnews\u201d spread on Twitter and claimed the top spot on Google News, albeit briefly. \n \n Burman, an economics professor at Syracuse University and Forbes blogger for 10 months, says his piece was intended as obvious satire. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s kind of baffling,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cIt was April Fools\u2019 Day, and it was completely implausible. Nobody in the party would have said those things.\u201d \n \n Those \u201cthings\u201d included faux quotes from the former Massachusetts governor saying that he has \u201cno chance\u201d to win the general election in December and that a Santorum candidacy would be in the \u201cbest interest of the party.\u201d \n \n Burman continued with Romney saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want to wait until 2020 to get my party back. I\u2019m all about efficiency. Let\u2019s get our butts kicked now and move on.\u201d \n \n News reports have Romney inching ever close to securing the GOP presidential nomination. \n \n Defending his piece, Burman says it was intended as satire, to call out \u201csome real issues with the right wing of the Republican Party. I was basically just trying to make a point about that.\u201d \n \n Shortly after the post was taken down, Burman published an explanation, saying Forbes pulled the entry down, \u201cbecause of an unannounced ban on April Fool\u2019s Day humor.\u201d Editors have since taken down that post as well. \n \n Burman says he writes, edits and publishes articles to the Forbes Web site, which are then back-read by editors. This was the first time he can remember editors taking down his content. \n \n The editor responsible for removing Burman\u2019s blogs, Executive Producer for Content Development Coates Bateman, did not immediately respond to messages left at his office. \n \n Forbes.com doesn\u2019t have a clear distinction among articles, blogs and columns, but to make his satirical intentions clear, Burman says he put the date \u2014 April 1, 2012 \u2014 at the bottom of the article. \n \n Up to this point, he says, \u201cI really thought the blog was my blog and as long as I didn\u2019t do anything grossly irresponsible \u2014 and I don\u2019t consider this to be in that category \u2014 I could do what I wanted with it.\u201d \n \n While his piece lives on in a personal blog he started this morning, Burman says he has learned an important lesson about the Web and social media. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s the way the Internet works.

I thought, \u2018Oh, boy, this is gonna look really bad on the evening news, let me tell you.\u2019 \u201d \n \n It turned out that Ryan and Johnson were in on the prank, which Romney\u2019s traveling aides had hatched up late Saturday night. They had built a fake set for a Romney event. The applause was really a soundtrack played through a set of speakers. \n \n \u201cSo not only did they do that, but they caught it on camera,\u201d Romney said. \u201cYou guys \u2014 this is known as \u2018forgive but remember,\u2019 I\u2019ll tell ya. We\u2019re gonna remember this.\u201d \n \n After aides shouted \u201cApril fools!\u201d at him, the former Massachusetts governor made his way to the real ballroom, where he addressed an overflow crowd of several hundred supporters and served them pancakes.",

    "document": "NEW PRAGUE, Minn. (WCCO) \u2014 A driver who was texting when she hit and killed a 79-year-old New Prague man will spend four days in jail after a judge ordered her sentence on Monday. \n \n A Le Sueur County judge sentenced 48-year-old Susan Ann Russo for the accident that happened nearly one year ago on Oct. 28, 2015. \n \n The victim, Joe Tikalsky, was a school bus driver who was walking out to his mailbox outside of his home when he was hit. \n \n The Tikalsky family is choosing action over anger. \n \n Emma Jean Tikalsky, who was married to Joe Tikalsky for 54 years, said Monday was the first time she and her children met with the driver who hit her husband. \n \n \u201cWe cried together and they begged us, my daughter and myself, \u2018Would you please find it in your heart to forgive us?'\u201d Emma Jean Tikalsky said. \u201cI knew that was the godlike thing I would be expected to do and we did. We said yes.\u201d \n \n The Tikalskys hope other drivers will realize it only takes a split second to take a life and change the lives of so many more people. \n \n \u201cFour days or 400 days, it really doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Emma Jean Tikalsky said. \u201cI know she didn\u2019t mean to kill anyone.\u201d \n \n Joe Tikalsky drove a New Prague school bus for almost 50 years. \n \n He was wearing his reflective jacket from work when he walked out to get the paper and was hit near his mailbox. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s even more scary knowing that we have this society that is, I\u2019ll say, addicted to their phone,\u201d Joe Tikalsky\u2019s son Greg said. \u201cHis kids were his pride and joy and his grandkids were his pride and joy.\u201d \n \n The family is working with lawmakers to lobby for more strict and defined distracted driving laws and consequences in Minnesota. \n \n It is illegal right now to read or send texts while driving, even when stopped at a light. \n \n \u201cWe care about people living and something must be done,\u201d Emma Jean Tikalsky said. \n \n Russo will spend two days in jail on the anniversary of Joe Tikalsky\u2019s death this year and two days next year on the anniversary as part of the agreement. \n \n Russo will also pay a $3,000 fine that the family wants used to raise awareness against distracted driving. ||||| Calling for wholesale change in societal views on the public health epidemic of distracted driving, a Le Sueur County judge sentenced a New Prague woman to community service, probation and four days in jail in the death a year ago of a 79-year-old school bus driver. \n \n \"You are a gifted teacher, use that gift,\" Judge Mark Vandelist said to Susan Ann Russo, seated at the defendant's table in a quiet courtroom filled with a couple dozen friends and family members of both the late Joseph Tikalsky and Russo. \n \n The judge encouraged Russo because he hoped she would become a force for change after the \"absolute tragic consequence\" of her distracted driving \u2014 likely while texting. \n \n Russo, 48, struck and killed Tikalsky on Oct. 28 as he collected his morning newspaper from a box on the road in front of his home. Tikalsky was wearing a reflective jacket at the time and was on break from his work as a school bus driver, a job he didn't need but continued because he loved being with kids. \n \n Amid teary statements from Tikalsky's widow, a son and two granddaughters \u2014 as well as from Russo herself \u2014 about the tragic crash, there was a call for help with distracted driving laws, especially pertaining to electronic devices. \n \n Tikalsky's youngest son. Greg, told the court he's begun lobbying for tougher laws, but to no avail. \"We have to view distracted driving as we view drunk driving,\" he said, adding that the latter was once more socially accepted than it is now. \n \n Susan Ann Russo \n \n While Minnesota law bans text messaging for all drivers, felony convictions for texting drivers who injure or kill others have been uncommon. \n \n Emma Jean Tikalsky said of her late husband, \"I would wish the way he died might be an example to other drivers to forgo electronics and concentrate on driving.\" \n \n Tikalsky's family spoke of a grandfather who never missed a sporting event or confirmation and taught the next generation how to make sauerkraut. \n \n From the defendant's table, Russo listened quietly. When it came her turn to speak, she tearfully read a letter she had written to Tikalsky, starting with, \"Dear Joe.\" She said her heart aches for him and his family every day and that she would trade places with him \"in a heartbeat\" if she could. \n \n \"I'm struggling to know how to move on,\" she said. \"It is very difficult to comprehend what I did and make sense of it all.\" \n \n Russo said the Tikalsky family will forever be in her thoughts, heart and prayers. \"I will spend my entire life trying to make up for my mistake,\" she said. \n \n Vandelist then imposed a sentence that had been agreed upon as part of a plea deal. Russo must complete 40 hours of community service with Minnesotans for Safe Driving within the next year, but Vandelist said he hopes she continues beyond the required hours to try to end a growing problem. \n \n \"I would bet that everyone in this courtroom has looked away from the road while driving,\" Vandelist said. No one shook their head in disagreement. \n \n The case underscored how difficult prosecuting distracted driving incidents can be. Reading or sending texts while behind the wheel, even when stopped at a light, is illegal in Minnesota. \n \n Russo told officers at the scene of the crash that she was reading a text before the crash and preparing to send one. But after she entered her plea in August, a forensic investigation found no activity or texts on her phone. \n \n Based on the forensics results, she attempted Monday to withdraw her plea. Vandelist denied that motion, saying regardless of whether she was texting, she should have seen Tikalsky. \n \n Russo will spend four days in the county jail divided in two stints coinciding with the anniversary of Tikalsky's death. She serves her first two days beginning Oct. 28 and the next on the same date in 2017. \n \n Vandelist put Russo on probation for two years, barring her from having active electronic devices in her vehicle or using drugs or alcohol. She also must pay a $3,000 fine that can be used for a billboard warning against distracted driving. \n \n In a quiet hallway after court ended, Emma Jean Tikalsky and her daughter Mary Jo Dorman approached Russo and hugged her. Tikalsky said it was a moment of forgiveness she had long prayed for. \n \n Added Dorman, \"I wanted her to see that we're moving on, and she should, too.\" \n \n Twitter: @rochelleolson ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

They have a notoriously low reproductive rate and are under pressure from factors such as habitat loss. \n \n The number of wild giant pandas rose nearly 17 percent over the decade to 2013 to reach 1,864, state media cited an official survey data as saying this month, with a government agency crediting conservation measures for the increase. \n \n Pandas are a major generator of tourist revenue in several parts of China and for Beijing, which capitalises on the global fascination with the animals by renting them to foreign zoos. \n \n They have been known to attack humans, including in 2008 when a panda mauled a 20-year-old man who climbed into its enclosure at a zoo in southern China. \n \n The nature conservation organisation WWF says on its website: \"As cuddly as they may look, a panda can protect itself as well as most other bears,\" using its heavy weight, strong jaw muscles and large molar teeth. \n \n It cautions: \"Although used mainly for crushing bamboo, a panda bite can be very nasty.\" ||||| The villager shows his injured leg after being attacked by a panda.

    "document": "Mercedes-Benz is tapping into the popularity of ultra-luxurious all-terrain vehicles, with a new Maybach SUV that can ferry passengers over desert dunes with an open top and thermal cupholders. \n \n The Mercedes-Maybach G-Class 650, shown at the Geneva auto show, will be the world\u2019s most expensive sport utility vehicle with a price of about $500,000. It\u2019s Daimler AG\u2019s latest extension of the top-of-the-line Maybach marque that it resurrected amid surging demand for higher-end models. Limited to a run of 99, the SUV will have a V12 engine and a landaulet style, with a front row that\u2019s covered and a retractable fabric roof in the back. \n \n The Mercedes-Maybach G650 Landaulet in Geneva on March 8. Photographer: Luke Macgregor/Bloomberg \n \n \u201cThis car meets the highest demands for luxury and yet still has all the elements that make the G-Class a real off-roader,\u201d said Gunner Guethenke, who heads Mercedes\u2019s SUV business. Customers who buy the marque\u2019s G-Class -- the segment is named for Gelaendewagen, the German term for all-terrain vehicles -- are looking for something \u201cunique,\u201d he said. \n \n Under pressure to foot the soaring bill of developing electric cars, autonomous-driving features and ride-sharing platforms, Daimler is more aggressively targeting ultra-wealthy customers with high-margin models on the one hand, while also adding more affordable cars that sell in large volumes. That strategy helped Mercedes unseat rival BMW AG as the world\u2019s best-selling luxury marque last year and allowed Daimler to boost its research and development budget by almost a quarter. \n \n After struggling for years to sustain a niche for Maybach, Mercedes revived the 1930\u2019s-era sub-brand in 2014 and has since expanded it with more opulent and spacious adaptations of popular models, such as convertible and three-row stretch limousine versions of the Mercedes S-Class sedan. \n \n The Maybach G650, which will test customers\u2019 appetite for a full-production SUV from that marque, will have an electric -- and dimmable -- glass partition to separate passengers from the driver, retractable footrests and folding tables stashed in the middle console. To master truly rugged terrains, the vehicle is positioned almost half a meter (1.6 feet) above the ground. It\u2019ll be available for sale after September. \n \n Exotic Versions \n \n Daimler isn\u2019t alone in chasing after the lucrative cash cow of luxury SUVS. Volkswagen AG\u2019s Bentley marque introduced the $229,100 Bentayga last year, currently the industry\u2019s priciest off-roader in regular production. BMW\u2019s Rolls-Royce is set to release its first 4x4 conveyance with an anticipated price tag of more than $400,000 next year. \n \n The boxy G-Class has been around since 1979. With a rugged exterior that\u2019s reminiscent of Land Rover\u2019s now discontinued Defender, the iconic car is Stuttgart-based Daimler\u2019s most expensive passenger vehicle, priced from $122,400. Production last year surpassed 20,000 units for the first time. \n \n Mercedes has a history of launching exotic versions of the G-Class. There\u2019s a sporty version sold by the performance-focused AMG sub-brand, which makes up half of all sales. The G63 AMG 6x6, a three-axle show car unveiled in 2013, had a pick-up load area behind a cabin that housed four electrically adjustable, heated and ventilated individual seats. Almost 200 of the 379,000-euro car were built. \n \n The carmaker \u201chas already pushed the boundaries pretty far with the standard G-Class,\u201d said Ian Fletcher, a London-based analyst with forecaster IHS Automotive. \u201cEvery time it does, customers just seem to lap it up.\u201d \n \n Read our complete coverage of the 2017 Geneva Motor Show. ||||| You read that model designation correctly: The team working under Dr. Gunnar G\u00fcthenke, CEO of Mercedes-Benz G (yep, the Gel\u00e4ndewagen platform has its very own CEO), started out with a basic G-wagen, took the portal axles of the ultra-aggressive 4\u00d74\u00b2 version, stuffed the G65 AMG\u2019s twin-turbocharged V-12 under the boxy hood, stretched the wheelbase by 22.8 inches, and added the \u201cfirst-class\u201d rear seats from the Mercedes-Maybach S-class. For good measure, the rear portion of the standard fixed roof has been replaced by a power-operated fabric top (last available nearly four years ago). Sure, it\u2019s a parts-bin production\u2014but using only parts from the shelf above the top shelf. Cars don\u2019t get much more extreme. Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche reacted with enthusiasm when he first saw the project and jacked up the production target, originally planned to be minuscule, to 99 units. ||||| Off-road driving is set to become more luxurious\u2014and expensive\u2014than ever before, thanks to the new Mercedes-Benz Maybach SUV unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show. \n \n Passengers aboard the V12-powered Mercedes-Maybach G-Class 650 will enjoy massages from designer leather chairs, warm drinks courtesy of thermal cup holders and a sunroof that opens to reveal the great outdoors, Bloomberg reports. \n \n All that pampering won\u2019t come cheap, though. At $500,000, the 99 units parent company Daimler AG ddaif plans to roll out will be the most expensive sports utility vehicles ever produced. \n \n These extravagant gas-guzzlers also represent a Faustian pact for the automaker: by targeting ultra-rich customers with high-margin models such as the Maybach, Bloomberg suggests, Mercedes is able to bankroll the development of electric cars, autonomous-driving features and ride-sharing platforms. \n \n For more on the Geneva Auto Show, see Fortune\u2019s video: \n \n So far, the strategy is working. Last year Mercedes surpassed BMW bmwyy as the world\u2019s best-selling luxury marque, allowing Daimler to step-up its research and development budget by almost a quarter. ||||| Oh, the Maybach brand! Remember when Mercedes-Benz relaunched it as its Rolls-Royce in 2002, only to lose a ton of money because seemingly nobody cared? Well, after the Maybach 57 and 62 were both killed off in 2012, Mercedes gave it another go, bringing the name back in 2015 as a sub-brand positioned above the top of the Mercedes range. And now, Daimler says one in every ten vehicles sold in the S-Class segment wears a Mercedes-Maybach badge. That's not bad, given that Maybach only offered variants of the S-Class sedan and the S 650 cabrio ... up until the arrival of this: the G 650 Landaulet. \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n The last time a Maybach was this capable off-road, Germany was invading Poland, but this G 650 Landaulet is more of a toy than a tank. Mercedes quietly discontinued the open-top G Wagen roughly three years ago, and while the AMG G63 6x6 was an absolute masterpiece, it only had a twin-turbo V8 under the hood, where clearly there's room for four more cylinders. Therefore, humanity needed a long-wheelbase version with an electric soft-top and a twin-turbo V12. Frankly, it was the logical step forward. \n \n The 22.75 inches added to the wheelbase (now 135 inches) allowed Mercedes to fit the G 65 Landaulet with individual rear captain's chairs, wrapped in the finest calf leather and able to fully recline. The occupants are held gently in place on any terrain by inflatable air chambers, while heated massage programs take care of their tense muscles. It's S-Class time in the G, and if the party gets even wilder, the electrically operated glass partition can be changed from transparent to opaque at the press of a button: \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n While the heated and cooled cupholders, the fancy seats, the premium stereo, the high-resolution displays and the entire open top experience all sound fun, it's not like the G65 Landaulet's driver will get bored. He or she will have 630 horsepower and 737 ft.-lb. of torque to play with, and 17.7 inches of ground clearance thanks to the portal axles. Like all G Wagens, this open-top bruiser has three locking differentials and a shift-on-the-fly low range. And let's not forget about the side pipes\u2014the G 65 Landaulet is a riot front, rear, and on both sides. \n \n Limited to just 99 units, production starts in Graz, Austria this autumn. If you can't wait that long, go and spec a private jet while you wait\u2014because while Mercedes hasn't announced a price, we're assuming it'll be even more costly than the $500,000-plus G 63 AMG 6x6. \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n Cool?

    "document": "Image caption The convoy carrying UN chemical weapons inspectors to the sites was targeted by snipers \n \n Diplomatic pressure on Syria has failed and the UK is considering its response to a suspected chemical attack, Foreign Secretary William Hague says. \n \n He told the BBC it would be possible for the UK and its allies to respond without the UN's unanimous backing. \n \n In Syria, UN inspectors visited the site of the suspected attack after their convoy was shot at by snipers. \n \n The PM is cutting his holiday short and is expected to hold a National Security Council meeting on Wednesday. \n \n Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has also cancelled a visit to Afghanistan to meet British troops. \n \n Downing Street said a decision on whether to recall Parliament would be made on Tuesday. \n \n The suspected chemical attack took place on Wednesday near the Syrian capital Damascus, and reportedly killed more than 300 people. \n \n Weapons inspectors carried out tests at the scene on Monday after unidentified snipers shot at one of their vehicles, a UN spokesman said. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption William Hague: UN Security Council has not shouldered its responsibilities \n \n Mr Hague told BBC Radio 4's Today programme while he could not go into options or a timetable for action, he was not \"going to rule anything in or out\". \n \n \"We, the United States, many other countries including France, are clear that we can't allow the idea in the 21st century that chemical weapons can be used with impunity,\" he said. \n \n A Downing Street spokesman said Prime Minister David Cameron had called Russia's President Vladimir Putin on Monday afternoon to discuss Syria and that they had reiterated the position that the use of chemical weapons should merit a \"serious response\" from the international community. \n \n But while Mr Cameron \"made clear there was little doubt\" the attack was carried out by the Syrian regime, Mr Putin \"said they did not have evidence of whether a chemical weapons attack had taken place or who was responsible,\" the spokesman said. \n \n MPs are due to return to the Commons on 2 September but there have been demands for Parliament to be recalled. \n \n Analysis Whitehall officials say no firm decision is likely to be taken on how Britain will respond to last week's alleged chemical attack in Syria until at least Wednesday. That is when David Cameron will be chairing a session of the National Security Council, attended by military and intelligence chiefs and senior ministers. It follows intense consultations between London and Washington with Downing Street keen to stress the two countries are acting in concert. Any military response, if it's decided on, is most likely to be confined to a one-off or limited guided missile strikes on selected Syrian military targets using Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from US Navy warships stationed hundreds of miles away in the eastern Mediterranean. US vessels there are reported to have about 400 such missiles onboard, while a Royal Navy submarine in the region can also carry cruise missiles. But Russia, Syria and Iran have all issued strong warnings against any western military action. \n \n Labour's shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said he would \"expect the prime minister to make his case to Parliament\" before a decision was made about UK involvement. \n \n The prime minister also had phone calls with other leaders, including US President Barack Obama, this weekend, where they agreed on the need to take \"strong action\". \n \n He will return several days early from his holiday in Cornwall with his family so he can chair Wednesday's high-level security briefing of senior ministers and defence and intelligence chiefs. \n \n It is understood the most likely military response would be a one-off or limited guided missile strikes on Syrian military targets fired from US Navy warships, says BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner. \n \n Prof Michael Clarke, of the Royal United Services Institute, said: \"Military advice to politicians in the US and the UK is 'don't think you can dabble in this - you have to go in with both feet'\". \n \n He told the BBC's PM programme limited air strikes might inconvenience the regime but were no guarantee you could stop it. \n \n Other options - such as a no-fly zone or a safe haven - would have to be led by the US, and at the moment most of the \"sabre-rattling\" was coming from France and the UK - not the US, he added. \n \n Whitehall officials have told the BBC the next key decisions would probably be taken at Wednesday's National Security Council meeting. \n \n 'Humanitarian need' \n \n Mr Hague said diplomatic methods to resolve the civil war in Syria had \"failed so far\". \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov: \"They [the West] have not been able to come up with any proof but are saying at the same time that the red line has been crossed\" \n \n He said the UN Security Council, split over Syria, had not \"shouldered its responsibilities\". \n \n The council is made up of 15 members including permanent members China, Russia, France, the US and the UK which have the power to veto any resolution. \n \n But any action could be taken \"without complete unity on the UN Security Council\", he said. \n \n He said a response could be \"based on great humanitarian need and distress\" and \"in accordance with international law\". \n \n The foreign secretary said the suspected chemical attack was carried out by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's regime but it blames rebel forces saying footage of the attack was \"fabricated\". ||||| WASHINGTON/BEIRUT The United States put Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on notice on Monday that it believes he was responsible for using chemical weapons against civilians last week in what Secretary of State John Kerry called a \"moral obscenity.\" \n \n \"President (Barack) Obama believes there must be accountability for those who would use the world's most heinous weapons against the world's most vulnerable people,\" Kerry said in the most forceful U.S. reaction yet to the August 21 attack. \n \n Speaking after U.N. chemical weapons experts came under sniper fire on their way to investigate the scene of the attack, White House spokesman Jay Carney said the use of chemical weapons was undeniable and \"there is very little doubt in our mind that the Syrian regime is culpable.\" \n \n Kerry said Obama was consulting with allies before he decides on how to respond. \n \n \"What we saw in Syria last week should shock the conscience of the world,\" Kerry told reporters. \n \n \"The indiscriminate slaughter of civilians, the killing of women and children and innocent bystanders by chemical weapons is a moral obscenity. By any standard, it is inexcusable. And despite the excuses and equivocations that some have manufactured, it is undeniable.\" \n \n Military chiefs from the United States and its European and Middle Eastern allies met in Jordan for what could be a council of war, should they decide to punish Assad, who has denied using chemical weapons and blamed rebels for staging such attacks. \n \n Many hundreds of people died in Damascus suburbs in what appears to have been the worst chemical weapons attack since Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein fatally gassed thousands of Kurds in 1988. \n \n U.N. investigators crossed the front line from the center of the capital, which remains under Assad's control, to inspect the Mouadamiya suburb, one of at least four neighborhoods hit by the poison gas before dawn last Wednesday. \n \n The United Nations said one vehicle in its convoy was crippled by gunshots fired by \"unidentified snipers.\" The team continued on after turning back for a replacement car. \n \n Syrian state television blamed rebel \"terrorists\" for the shooting. The opposition blamed pro-Assad militiamen. \n \n \"I am with the team now,\" a doctor who uses the name Abu Karam told Reuters by telephone from Mouadamiya. \"We are in the Rawda mosque and they are meeting with the wounded. Our medics and the inspectors are talking to the patients and taking samples from the victims now.\" \n \n Wassim al-Ahmad, an opposition activist, said members of the Free Syrian Army umbrella rebel organization and the opposition's Mouadamiya Local Council were accompanying the inspectors on their tour of the suburb. \n \n \"The inspectors are now examining victims being treated at a makeshift hospital in Mouadamiya and are taking blood samples from them,\" Ahmad said. \n \n INTERVIEWING SURVIVORS \n \n Video filmed at the site showed inspectors in black and blue body armor and blue U.N. helmets walking through a street as curious onlookers came up to watch. \n \n They shook hands with men who appeared to be rebels wearing camouflage vests, and were accompanied by doctors and residents. The group descended into the basement of a building where they were told injured survivors were being treated to protect them from more shelling. Another video showed an inspector interviewing a patient and taking notes. \n \n Activists say at least 80 people were killed in Mouadamiya when the district was hit with poison gas. Hundreds of people also were killed in three other rebel-held districts - Irbin, Ain Tarma and Jobar. \n \n An opposition activist said a large crowd of people gathered to air their grievances to the U.N. inspectors, who planned to take samples from corpses. \n \n The inspectors later returned to their hotel and, within an hour, residents reported the shelling of Mouadamiya had resumed. \n \n The decision to proceed with the mission despite coming under attack thwarted an apparent attempt to halt the inspectors' work before it began. \n \n \"The first vehicle of the Chemical Weapons Investigation Team was deliberately shot at multiple times by unidentified snipers in the buffer zone area,\" the United Nations said in a statement. \"It has to be stressed again that all sides need to extend their cooperation so that the team can safely carry out their important work.\" \n \n The inspectors had been stuck in a downtown hotel since the attack, waiting five days for government permission to visit the scene a few miles away. They had arrived three days before the incident, with a mandate to investigate earlier reports of more limited chemical weapons use. \n \n ASSAD TOO LATE \n \n Kerry said Assad's decision to finally allow access was too late to be credible. \"That is not the behavior of a government that has nothing to hide,\" Kerry said, adding that Assad's forces had also destroyed evidence by shelling the area. \n \n \"Our sense of basic humanity is offended not only by this cowardly crime, but also by the cynical attempt to cover it up,\" Kerry said. \n \n He said the U.N. inspectors could at most confirm that chemical weapons were used, not who used them, but that it was Assad's government that has such weapons and the means of delivering them. He said Washington had additional information on the attack that it would make known soon. \n \n Washington and its allies say they worry that the time that has elapsed, and continuous shelling by Assad's forces of the affected areas, could make it impossible for the inspectors to collect evidence. The United Nations said Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was confident the team could get the data it needs. \n \n Speculation has been mounting that Western countries will order some kind of military response to an incident that took place a year after Obama declared the use of chemical weapons a \"red line\" that would require strong action. \n \n With his international credibility seen increasingly on the line, Obama could opt for limited measures such as cruise missile strikes to punish Assad and seek to deter further chemical attacks, without dragging Washington deeper into the war. The United States has started a naval buildup in the region to be ready for Obama's decision. \n \n In neighboring Israel, citizens have been queuing up for gas masks in case Assad responds to a Western attack by firing on Israel, as Iraq's Saddam did in 1991. \n \n PHONE CONSULTATIONS \n \n With tensions rising over Syria, British Prime Minister David Cameron cut short a holiday to lead a top-level security meeting. Obama, Cameron and French President Francois Hollande all spoke to each other and other allies in the past few days in a flurry of phone calls. Cameron also called Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday. \n \n Several NATO countries have issued statements pledging a response, although none has been specific about what is planned. \n \n Top military officers of the United States, Britain, France, other NATO allies and the main anti-Assad countries in the region, including Saudi Arabia and Turkey, met in Jordan on Monday to discuss Syria, diplomats there said. \n \n The conference was planned but took on new significance because of the latest events, the diplomats said. \n \n The chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Martin Dempsey, a co-host of the meeting with his Jordanian counterpart, has been one of the voices in Washington urging caution and emphasizing the costs of a full-scale military intervention in a war in the heart of the Middle East. \n \n Obama, who withdrew U.S. troops from Iraq and is winding down the conflict in Afghanistan, is reluctant to involve the United States in another war. A Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Saturday showed about 60 percent of Americans opposed U.S. military intervention, while only 9 percent thought Obama should act. \n \n ASSAD DEFIANT \n \n Assad denies the accusations that his forces used chemical weapons and said the United States would be defeated if it intervened in his country. \n \n \"Would any state use chemicals or any other weapons of mass destruction in a place where its own forces are concentrated? That would go against elementary logic,\" he told the Russian newspaper Izvestia. \"Failure awaits the United States as in all previous wars it has unleashed, starting with Vietnam and up to the present day.\" \n \n Russia, Assad's main arms supplier and diplomatic defender in the U.N. Security Council, says rebels may have been behind the chemical attack. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said any intervention in Syria without a Security Council resolution would be a grave violation of international law. \n \n French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius noted that Russia and China would probably veto a U.N. Security Council vote to allow strikes against Syria. But British Foreign Secretary William Hague said it would still be possible to respond to a chemical weapons attack without the Security Council's permission. \n \n There are precedents. In 1999 NATO attacked Serbia, a Russian ally, without a Security Council resolution, arguing that action was needed to protect civilians in Kosovo. \n \n Turkey, a NATO ally and major backer of Syria's opposition, said it would join any international coalition even if a decision for action could not be reached at the United Nations. \n \n (Additional reporting by Mariam Karouny in Beirut, Khaled Yacoub Oweis in Amman, John Irish in Paris, Katya Golubkova in Moscow, Steve Holland and Paul Eckert in Washington.; Writing by Matt Spetalnick and Claudia Parsons; Editing by Bill Trott and Christopher Wilson) ||||| Story highlights Strikes could be just one chapter in a long war, analyst says \n \n U.N. inspectors visit scene of reported poison gas attack \n \n Kerry's remarks indicate a strike is likely, expert says \n \n A vehicle used by U.N. inspectors was shot at multiple times, U.N. says \n \n U.N. experts got to inspect the site of a reported chemical attack on civilians near Syria's capital Monday as the United States accused the Syrian government of trying to cover up the attack. \n \n The U.N. inspectors entered the town of Moadamiyet al-Sham and appeared to be examining the area accompanied by doctors, according to videos posted on social media by Syrian activists. The team had a \"very productive\" day and will continue its work Tuesday after examining its findings Monday evening, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said in New York. \n \n Government and opposition forces have accused each other of unleashing poison gas last week in the suburban Damascus area of Ghouta. Syria's opposition said that as many as 1,300 people were killed, prompting new calls for Western powers to intervene in the country's 2-year-old civil war. \n \n In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called the use of chemical weapons a \"moral obscenity\" that could not go unanswered, and he said Syrian actions are \"not the behavior of a government that has nothing to hide.\" \n \n Kerry stopped short of directly accusing President Bashar al-Assad's government of a massacre. But he said, \"We know that the Syrian regime maintains custody of these chemical weapons. We know that the Syrian regime has the capacity to do this with rockets. We know that the regime has been determined to clear the opposition from those very places where the attacks took place.\" \n \n Photos: Unrest in Syria Photos: Unrest in Syria Syrian civil war in photos \u2013 In this photo provided by the anti-government activist group Aleppo Media Center, Syrian men help survivors out of a building in Aleppo after it was bombed, allegedly by a Syrian regime warplane on Saturday, February 8.

There were no reports of injuries. \n \n U.N. officials did not say who was behind the shooting or the explosion, which witnesses said may have been caused by a mortar shell. The Syrian government accused \"terrorists\" of firing on the inspectors, Syrian state TV reported. \n \n U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said inspectors visited hospitals, interviewed witnesses, survivors and doctors and collected some samples. Speaking from Seoul, South Korea, Ban said he has directed the group to register a \"strong complaint\" to government and opposition forces to make sure the team's safety is guaranteed. \n \n The Syrian government agreed to grant the inspectors full access on Sunday, pledging to cease all hostilities as long as the team was on the ground, the United Nations said. And an umbrella group for the Syrian opposition, the Syrian National Coalition, said rebel forces would ensure the safety of any U.N. personnel in the area. \n \n But the government would not let U.N. inspectors approach the site for days, and the team feared that the chemical evidence may have dissipated. \n \n Attacks could reinforce poison gas 'taboo' \n \n Middle East analyst Richard Haass told CNN's The Lead that Kerry's comments \"went far out on a limb\" and indicate that a U.S. strike on Syria was in the works, with or without U.N. Security Council backing. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said military action was needed \"to underscore the principle, the norm, the taboo that these weapons ought to have.\" \n \n \"No one, Syria or anybody else, now and forevermore, should be able to use such weapons, much less biological or nuclear weapons, with impunity,\" he said. But he said Washington should limit its intervention in the conflict, \"so we don't get enmeshed in what I think could become a quagmire.\" \n \n \"If we want to help the opposition, the best way to do it is through considerable arming of those elements of the opposition with agendas we can support,\" he said. \n \n But with Syria already seen as a proxy war that has been spilling across its neighbors' borders for months, the prospects for improvement aren't likely to be aided by American airstrikes, said Andrew Tabler, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \n \n \"This is just going to be one chapter in a very long struggle we have in Syria,\" Tabler told CNN's The Situation Room. \n \n Russia, Syria's leading ally, has raised sharp objections to the possibility of any outside intervention. Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Monday that reports of the use of chemical weapons must be \"thoroughly and professionally investigated\" and submitted to the U.N. Security Council. \n \n At a news conference Monday, Lavrov said there's no proof yet that the Syrian government was involved in last week's reported attack. And Sunday, a Foreign Ministry statement compared the Western allegations against Syria to the claims that Iraq was hoarding weapons of mass destruction before the U.S. invasion in 2003 -- claims that fell apart once American troops began searching for them. \n \n Charles Duelfer, the former head of U.S. weapons inspection teams in Iraq, said the U.N. experts will be looking to collect evidence from witnesses and survivors of last week's attack, including samples that can be analyzed later. \n \n \"They'll be looking for remnants of the munitions, which could be sophisticated munitions that a military would have -- or if it turns out, unexpectedly, to be the case that the insurgents had cobbled together some sort of CW capability, maybe they'll find that,\" Duelfer said. \n \n Duelfer said he expects the U.S. government has its own sources: \"Presumably, the National Security Agency can listen to people besides the United States, so they may have data which the weapons inspectors may not have,\" he told The Situation Room. But while Washington's evidence may be solid, U.N. inspectors \"provide credibility across the board.\" \n \n \"When they say something, presumably all countries will say. 'OK, we can accept that, they don't have a dog in that fight,' \" Duelfer said. \n \n U.S. officials have said they have no credible evidence pointing to opposition groups using chemical weapons. And the Obama administration is expected to declassify the intelligence assessment backing up its assertion that the Syrian regime was responsible for last week's attack before any U.S. military action would take place, a senior administration official said Monday. \n \n That evidence \"includes but is not limited to\" satellite images of activity at Syrian military installations identified as including chemical weapons depots, a senior administration official familiar with the intelligence told CNN. \n \n And Kerry said he had argued to Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem last week that if the government had nothing to hide, \"then their response should be immediate: immediate transparency, immediate access, not shelling.\" \n \n \"Failure to permit that, I told him, would tell its own story,\" he said. \n \n Al-Assad: It wasn't us \n \n The Pentagon has sent four warships armed with cruise missiles to the region, and Obama will be presented with final options regarding actions against Syria in the next few days, a senior administration official said Monday. \n \n But as U.S. muscle plows the waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea, al-Assad on Monday repeated his government's denial that his army had anything to do with the use of poison gas. \n \n \"The area of the claimed attack is in contiguity with the Syrian army positions, so how is it possible that any country would use chemical weapons in an area where its own forces are located?\" he asked in an interview with Russian newspaper Izvestia. \n \n Al-Assad accused the United States, Britain and France of exploiting the incident by trying to verify rebel allegations instead of verifying facts. \n \n The use of a large amount of chemical weapons would cross a \"red line\" and threaten U.S. interests in the region, Obama announced last year. Tabler, who has had extensive contacts with al-Assad, said the Syrian leader may have watched as Washington reacted cautiously to previous reports of chemical warfare and gambled incorrectly that last week's attack would draw a similar response. \n \n \"I think he thought that he could push the envelope again and that he could actually show his own people that no one is going to come to their rescue,\" Tabler said. \n \n Opposition accusations \n \n JUST WATCHED Syria agrees to let U.N. investigate Replay More Videos ...

More than 1,300 people died, most of them by gas, according to opposition spokesman Khaled al-Saleh. \n \n The opposition backed up the allegations with gruesome video of rows of dead bodies, including women and children. They had no visible wounds, and some appeared to be bloated. The aid agency Medecins sans Frontieres said three hospitals it supports in Syria's Damascus governorate reported having received about 3,600 patients displaying neurotoxic symptoms on Wednesday morning. \n \n But according to Syrian state-run television's depiction of events, government forces came into contact with a gas attack on Saturday in Jobar, on the edge of Damascus. Several of the soldiers were \"suffocating\" from exposure to gases as they entered the city, according to state TV. \n \n \"It is believed that the terrorists have used chemical weapons in the area,\" Syrian TV reported, citing an anonymous source. The government uses the term \"terrorists\" to describe rebel forces. \n \n Broadcast video showed a room containing gas masks, gas canisters and other paraphernalia that could be used in a gas attack. The army said it uncovered the cache in a storage facility in the area. \n \n CNN could not independently confirm the authenticity of video shown by the government or rebels. ||||| Syria agreed Sunday to a U.N. investigation into last week's alleged chemical weapons attack outside Damascus _ a deal a senior White House official dismissed as \"too late to be credible,\" saying the United States has \"very little doubt\" President Bashar Assad's forces used such weapons. \n \n FILE- This Aug. 21, 2013, file image provided by by Shaam News Network, which has been authenticated based on its contents and other AP reporting, purports to show several bodies being buried during a...

(Associated Press) \n \n The hardening of the U.S. position came as calls for military action grow. In a sign the U.S. may be a step closer to an armed response, naval forces have already been dispatched toward Syria's coastal waters, although President Barack Obama has cautioned against a hasty decision. \n \n With France, Britain, Israel and some U.S. congressmen urging swift military action against Assad's regime if the use of chemical agents is confirmed, the U.N. team's conclusions could have a dramatic impact on the trajectory of the country's civil war. \n \n The agreement struck in Damascus calls for U.N. experts already in the country to begin an investigation Monday into the suspected chemical attack on rebel-held areas in the capital's eastern suburbs. \n \n Anti-government activists and Doctors Without Borders say that more than 300 people were killed in an artillery barrage by regime forces Wednesday that included the use of toxic gas. The government calls the allegations \"absolutely baseless.\" \n \n The suburbs hit in the suspected chemical strike, collectively known as eastern Ghouta, are under the control of rebel fighters, and regime artillery and warplanes have pounded the area for days. The U.N. inspectors will have to traverse through both government-held and opposition-controlled turf to conduct their probe. Rebels have said they will help facilitate the visit. \n \n Under Sunday's agreement with the U.N., the Syrian government \"affirmed that it will provide the necessary cooperation, including the observance of the cessation of hostilities at the locations related to the incident,\" U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky said in a statement. \n \n In Washington, a senior administration official said the U.S. has \"very little doubt\" that regime forces used chemical weapons in Wednesday's attack, an assessment that was \"based on the reported number of victims, reported symptoms of those who were killed or injured\" as well as witness accounts and facts gathered by the U.S intelligence community. \n \n The official, who insisted on anonymity because of lack of authorization to speak publicly about the developments, was dismissive of the Syrian government's agreement to grant access to the U.N. team, saying it was \"too late to be credible.\" \n \n The regime's continuing shelling of the site would have \"significantly corrupted\" any available evidence of chemical weapons, the official said. \n \n The U.N. team was in Syria to look into three earlier suspected chemical attacks, with a mandate to determine whether such weapons were used, not who was responsible for unleashing them. There was no indication that the mission's brief had been expanded to assess who was behind Wednesday's attack. \n \n Even as the pressure mounts for a strong international response, there is no guarantee that foreign powers will take action if the U.N. confirms chemical agents were used. But the scale of the attack makes this instance far harder to ignore than previous suspected cases. \n \n A senior State Department official, not authorized to comment publicly by name, said U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with the top diplomats of Britain, France, Canada and Russia as well as U.N. Secretary Ban Ki-Moon. \n \n The official said Kerry stressed that if the Syrian regime wanted to prove to the world that it had not used chemical weapons in this incident, it would have stopped shelling the area and granted immediate access five days ago. \n \n U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel offered no hints Sunday about likely U.S. responses, telling reporters traveling with him in Malaysia that the Obama administration was still assessing intelligence about Wednesday's attack. \n \n \"When we have more information, that answer will become clear,\" he said when a reporter asked whether it was a matter of when, not if, the U.S. will take military action against Syria. \n \n \"There are risks and consequences for any option that would be used or not used _ for action or inaction,\" he told reporters. \"You have to come to the central point of what would be the objective if you are to pursue an action or not pursue an action. So all those assessments are being made.\" \n \n The U.S. has about a dozen F-16 jets, a Patriot missile battery and as many as 1,000 American troops in Jordan, which all could also be used in any military action. U.S. administration and defense officials in recent days have said the most likely military move would be the launch of Tomahawk missiles off ships in the Mediterranean. \n \n U.S. senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, who have criticized the Obama administration's hands-off approach to Syria, said in a joint statement that in light of the latest suspected chemical attack, \"now is the time for decisive actions.\" \n \n \"The United States must rally our friends and allies to take limited military actions in Syria that can change the balance of power on the ground and create conditions for a negotiated end to the conflict and an end to Assad's rule,\" the statement said. \n \n In Paris, French President Francois Hollande said a \"body of evidence\" suggests that chemical weapons were used during last week's attacks, and \"everything\" leads France to believe that the Assad regime was behind it. \n \n Conveying new urgency about the situation, Hollande's office said he spoke about Syria by telephone Sunday with Obama, as well as prime ministers David Cameron of Britain and Kevin Rudd of Australia. The White House said in a statement the two leaders discussed \"possible responses by the international community and agreed to continue to consult closely.\" \n \n Just over a year ago, Obama called the use of chemical arms in Syria a \"red line\" that would carry \"enormous consequences.\" Since then, U.S. intelligence believes that such weapons have been used on a small scale several times, but that has precipitated no major shift in American policy or substantial action against the Assad regime. \n \n So far, the U.S. has largely limited its support for the rebels to non-lethal supplies. In June, Washington said it would begin sending weapons to the rebels, although there's no indication that has happened yet. \n \n Russia, a close ally of the Assad regime, welcomed Syria's decision to allow a U.N. probe, and said the U.S. should await the findings and realize that a unilateral use of force would be a mistake. \n \n Foreign Ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said Washington and European partners shouldn't take a \"gamble\" that could have \"catastrophic consequences\" for Syria and the region as a whole. \n \n In Damascus, Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi said the United States was using allegations of chemical attacks as an \"excuse\" to intervene in Syria, accusing Washington and Europe of turning a blind eye while Saudi Arabia and Turkey _ both backers of the anti-Assad rebellion _ provide chemical weapons to foreign jihadi fighters in Syria. \n \n \"The materials are coming from Saudi Arabia and Turkey,\" al-Zoubi said in an interview with The Associated Press in the Syrian capital, adding that foreign fighters were carrying out chemical attacks to implicate the Syrian government in hopes of prompting international military intervention. \n \n \"Instead of the Americans searching for the source of these chemical weapons in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, they wait for them to be used to give a pretext to intervene in Syria,\" he said. \n \n Iran, a close ally of the Assad regime, warned against a possible U.S. military move against Syria. The semi-official Fars news agency quoted Gen. Masoud Jazayeri as warning that \"trespassing over the red line in Syria will have severe consequences for the White House.\" He did not elaborate. \n \n Doctors Without Borders said that three hospitals it supports in the area of the attack reported receiving roughly 3,600 patients with \"neurotoxic symptoms\" over a three-hour period Wednesday. Of those, 355 died, the Paris-based group said. \n \n That roughly coincided with the death toll given by the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tallied 322 killed. Casualty figures have varied widely over the alleged attack, from just over 300 to around 1,300 killed. \n \n Rebels on the ground outraged by the images coming out of the Damascus suburbs have also threatened to take forceful action. \n \n On Sunday, the head of an al-Qaida-linked Syrian rebel group vowed to target villages inhabited by members of Assad's minority Alawite sect to avenge the purported chemical weapons attack. \n \n In an audio recording posted on a website frequently used by Islamic extremists, Jabhat al-Nusra leader, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, said: \"Revenge for the blood of your children is a debt to be paid back ... 1,000 rockets will be fired at them in revenge for the massacre of Ghouta.\" \n \n The authenticity of the claim could not be immediately verified. \n \n ___ \n \n Lucas reported from Beirut. Associated Press writers Jamey Keaten in Paris, Jamal Halaby in Amman, Jordan, and Kimberly Dozier, Lolita C. Baldor and Matthew Lee in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Yolande Knell: \"The UN has always said the safety of its team is paramount\" \n \n Unidentified snipers have opened fire on a convoy of UN experts investigating suspected chemical weapons attacks in Syria's capital, the UN has said. \n \n One car was shot at \"multiple times\", forcing the convoy to turn back. \n \n Syrian state media blamed opposition \"terrorists\" for the attack, though the claim could not be verified. \n \n The UN team later resumed its mission, entering the western district of Muadhamiya to gather evidence, before returning to central Damascus. \n \n Hundreds died in alleged attacks on Wednesday in five districts near Damascus. \n \n The US said there was little doubt that Syrian forces used chemical weapons in the attacks, which reportedly killed more than 300 people in rebel-held areas. \n \n Syrian President Bashar al-Assad dismissed the accusation as \"an insult to common sense\" and warned the US against military intervention. \n \n \"If someone is dreaming of making Syria a puppet of the West, then this will not happen,\" he told the Russian newspaper Izvestiya. \n \n 'Intimidation' \n \n The 20-member UN inspection team has been in Syria since 18 August to look into three earlier suspected chemical attacks. They were given permission on Sunday to examine the Damascus locations. \n \n Image caption The UN inspectors have been talking to doctors in Muadhamiya \n \n The experts intend to take soil, blood, urine and tissue samples for laboratory testing but they are unlikely to apportion blame for any of the attacks. \n \n Video footage posted online appears to show UN inspectors in Muadhamiya taking samples and talking to residents. \n \n They went to a Red Crescent centre and spoke to doctors, opposition activists said. \n \n On the video, which the BBC has not been able to fully authenticate, one resident is heard telling an inspector of heavy raids on the district, with \"over 600 canister strikes...12 tanks, 100 soldiers\". \n \n Shortly after setting out from their hotel in Damascus, the inspectors' cars came under fire \"multiple times by unidentified snipers\", according to a statement from the UN. \n \n Analysis Whitehall officials say no firm decision is likely to be taken on how Britain will respond to last week's alleged chemical attack in Syria until at least Wednesday. That is when UK PM David Cameron will be chairing a session of the National Security Council, attended by military and intelligence chiefs and senior ministers. It follows intense consultations between London and Washington with Downing Street keen to stress the two countries are acting in concert. Any military response, if it is decided on, is most likely to be confined to a one-off or limited guided missile strikes on selected Syrian military targets using Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from US Navy warships stationed hundreds of miles away in the eastern Mediterranean. US vessels there are reported to have around 400 such missiles onboard, while a Royal Navy submarine in the region can also carry cruise missiles. But Russia, Syria and Iran have all issued strong warnings against any western military action. \n \n The team returned safely back to the government checkpoint before setting out again. \n \n The convoy was \"deliberately targeted\" and it seemed someone was trying to intimidate the team, the UN Secretary General's spokesman, Farhan Haq, told the BBC. \n \n The inspectors have now returned to their hotel and are expected to resume their work on Tuesday. \n \n Military action \n \n A year ago, US President Barack Obama said the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government would be \"a red line\" that could trigger US military action. \n \n Washington has recently bolstered its naval presence in the eastern Mediterranean, and military leaders from the US, UK and their allies are meeting in Jordan. \n \n But the UN Security Council remains divided, with China and Russia appearing unlikely to drop their objection to stricter sanctions on Mr Assad's government. \n \n Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday that diplomats should be cautious in dealing with the chemical weapons issue, and Moscow warned Western nations not to prejudge the outcome of the inspections. \n \n Western politicians have begun to suggest taking action outside of the UN system. \n \n UK Foreign Secretary William Hague told the BBC that action could be taken without UN approval if there was \"great humanitarian need\" in Syria. \n \n His French counterpart Laurent Fabius suggested the UN Security Council could be bypassed \"in certain circumstances\". \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption William Hague: UN Security Council has not shouldered its responsibilities \n \n But in his latest comments on the crisis, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said any intervention in Syria without a UN mandate would be a \"grave violation of international law\". \n \n The West, he told a news conference in Moscow, had not been able to come up with any proof of chemical weapons use while \"saying at the same time that the red line has been crossed and there can be no delay\". \n \n 'Neurotoxic symptoms' \n \n Western officials were unimpressed with Syria's decision to allow in the UN experts. \n \n Mr Hague said evidence could have been tampered with, degraded or destroyed in the five days since the attack. \n \n A senior White House official, quoted by AP news agency, dismissed the visit as \"too late to be credible\". \n \n Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said on Saturday that three hospitals it supports in the Damascus area had treated about 3,600 patients with \"neurotoxic symptoms\" on Wednesday morning, of whom 355 had died. \n \n While MSF said it could not \"scientifically confirm\" the use of chemical weapons, staff at the hospitals described a large number of patients arriving in the space of less than three hours with symptoms including convulsions, pinpoint pupils and breathing problems. \n \n Syria's security forces are widely believed to possess large undeclared stockpiles of mustard gas and sarin nerve agent. \n \n It is one of seven countries that have not joined the 1997 convention banning chemical weapons. ||||| German politicians across the political spectrum are urging extreme caution over proposals by the US and Britain to launch a military offensive in Syria. \n \n The governing Christian Democrats (CDU) of chancellor Angela Merkel insisted that Germany was pressing on in pursuit of a diplomatic solution, but suggested for the first time that it might support an international military response if it is proved that Syrian government troops used chemical weapons to attack its opponents. Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said that if UN inspectors confirmed the use of chemical weapons, Syria \"must be punished\". \n \n He confirmed for the first time the government's belief that there is a \"very high probability of a poison gas attack\" and while he would not rule out the use of force, he would not speculate on what sort of response might be appropriate. Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said that if the attack was confirmed, \"Germany would be among those who consider consequences to be appropriate.\" \n \n The statements indicate a shift away from the government's hitherto insistence on a political solution to the conflict, with defence minister Thomas de Maiziere declaring just this weekend that: \"Outside military intervention in this terrible civil war in Syria is just not something I envisage,\" while Philipp Missfelder, head foreign policy expert of the CDU insisted: \"Germany is rightly continuing to work on a political remedy.\" \n \n The government's shift could yet turn the Syrian issue into a hotly debated election theme that could even influence the outcome of the poll in a month's time. \n \n Most Germans are against military intervention and the current debate recalls the fallout in 2002 when Germany was divided over the looming intervention in Iraq ahead of that year's general election. Making the war his central election issue, and successfully presenting his party as the party of peace in opposition to the conservatives' candidate Edmund Stoiber and the CDU head Angela Merkel, the SPD's candidate Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, while accused of opportunism, managed to secure his reelection. \n \n Until now, the issue of war had not featured as an election issue at all with all parties in solid agreement \u2013 cementing their pacifist alliance in a Bundestag vote a month ago \u2013 that intervention by the west in Syria was to be avoided at all costs. The sense of solidarity is in contrast to the situation in 2011 when German politicians were divided over the UN security council's resolution over intervention in Libya. \n \n But with the German population skeptical about military intervention and weary of its armed forces' less than triumphant experiences in Afghanistan, any party that pushes the call for western involvement, most especially anything which would involve German participation, risks losing voters. Despite widespread predictions that her reelection is a shoo-in, a decision by Merkel to support military intervention could have serious consequences for her future. \n \n Meanwhile, Claudia Roth, the head of the opposition Greens and the strongest political voice of the pacifist movement in the Bundestag, has continued to stress the urgency of coming up with a non-military remedy. \"All parties need to come to a political solution as soon as possible,\" she said. She stressed that China and Russia \"have to put pressure on the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and to stop delivering weapons to Syria immediately\". \n \n The Social Democrats' (SPD) candidate for next month's general election, Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, urged \"restraint regarding the discussions about military intervention\". \n \n Most politicians have welcomed the decision by Assad to allow entry to UN weapon inspectors even if only to secure more time in which a political solution might be reached. \"This is an important agreement in a dramatic situation,\" said Westerwelle. \n \n Dirk Niebel of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) said that Germany should focus its energies on helping the civilian population. \"There are more than 100,000 dead and two million refugees and they're the ones we need to help including here in Germany,\" he said.",

A UN rep confirms that one of the team's vehicles was \"deliberately shot at multiple times\" by unidentified snipers in Damascus; all are safe. The shooting reportedly occurred in the buffer zone between rebel- and government-controlled territory, and the team will head back to the area once it replaces its vehicle, reports the AP. The Syrian government, for its part, has already blamed \"terrorists,\" reports CNN. More: Once they finally reach the site of last week's alleged attack, UN inspectors will spend two days taking soil, blood, urine, and tissue samples, reports the BBC. But Reuters reports that the US and its allies aren't expecting much: They believe the regime's offer to allow inspectors to the site came too late and any remaining evidence has probably been destroyed by heavy shelling. To wit, a senior White House official dismissed the visit as \"too late to be credible.\" Assad, meanwhile, says that any American attempt at military intervention will be doomed to fail. \"Failure awaits the United States as in all previous wars it has unleashed, starting with Vietnam and up to the present day,\" he said in an interview with a Russian newspaper. UN chief Ban Ki-moon warns that \"every hour counts\" in determining the facts of what was a \"major and terrible incident,\" reports the Guardian. \"We cannot allow impunity in what appears to be a grave crime against humanity,\" he said. But the UN Security Council, which is split on the issue, has already failed to shoulder its responsibilities and the UK and its allies may have to take action without its approval, Britain's foreign minister says. \"Is it possible to respond to chemical weapons without complete unity on the UN Security Council?\" William Hague tells the BBC. \"I would argue yes it is, otherwise it might be impossible to respond to such outrages.\"",

One of the vehicles in the convoy was hit by a sniper's bullet, but UN officials were able to get out of the vehicle and continue on to the site, where they carried out tests. In other Syria news: Bashar al-Assad's regime has denied involvement in the attack, the AP reports. \"The Syrian regime categorically denies any responsibility for the use of chemical weapons,\" a foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement today. The regime says it will cooperate with any investigation by the UN and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. The US, France, and Britain are considering a military response to the attack, and David Cameron has already cut his holiday short to attend a National Security Council meeting tomorrow, the BBC reports. Britain's foreign secretary says it would be possible for the UK and its allies to respond without the unanimous backing of the UN Security Council. \"We, the United States, many other countries including France, are clear that we can't allow the idea in the 21st century that chemical weapons can be used with impunity,\" he said.",

That optimism didn't last long. \n \n They instead saw the reality of torture at the hands of Kim Jong Un's brutal regime: their son was now blind and deaf, with mangled teeth, jerking violently and moaning on a stretcher with a feeding tube coming out of his nose. \n \n NEWLY EXPOSED VIDEO REVEALS BRUTAL TACTICS OF OTTO WARMBIER'S SADISTIC TORTURERS \n \n That's how he would spend his final days before dying at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center on June 19. \n \n President Trump, who has previously talked about Warmbier's treatment in stark terms, tweeted about the interview with Fred and Cindy: \"Great interview on @foxandfriends with the parents of Otto Warmbier: 1994 - 2017.

He was denied consular visits, and his family had no word of him after March 2016, until they were told this June that he had been in a coma for more than a year. He was medically evacuated and arrived back in Cincinnati for treatment June 13. \n \n Doctors said Warmbier had suffered extensive loss of brain tissue, consistent with cardiopulmonary arrest, and was in a state of unresponsive wakefulness. They were unsure what had caused the brain damage: He did not show any obvious indications of trauma, nor evidence of either acute or healing fractures. However, they also were not aware of anything from his previous medical history, before his time in North Korea, that might have caused cardiopulmonary arrest. \n \n Warmbier died less than a week later, on June 19. \n \n [What happened to Otto Warmbier?

Taboo no more.Seth MacFarlane, the roast master for the event, launched right in and zeroed in on the video.\"How do you make jokes about a joke? How do you embarrass a man who so thoroughly embarrasses himself?\" he asked as the crowd roared with laughter. \"How do you put someone down when they are already lying shirtless on the floor?\"And that was only the beginning. While fellow roasters like Hulk Hogan, Jerry Springer and Pamela Anderson looked on, Hasselhoff sat in the middle on a red, oversized lifeguard's chair. His arms were folded in front of him for much of the night, but he gamely laughed at most of the jokes that were hurled at him.It might have been his greatest acting role ever. Though during the first commercial break, he showed a little chink in the armor. \"It's going to be a long night,\" he said in the direction of his two daughters, who were in the audience.Insult specialist and former 'Dancing with the Stars' contestant Jeffrey Ross inquired what drink Hasselhoff had in a dark red glass on his lifeguard's chair. When the Hoff insisted it was water, Ross expressed disbelief and then continued his attack.\"I must admit, I did love you in that cheeseburger commercial you once made,\" Ross mocked, insisting the motto from the burger chain must have been \"Have it Floor Way!\"\"I'm so relieved you're wearing a shirt tonight because it will be so much easier than picking the vomit out of your chest hair later,\" Ross continued.Even animal rights activist and 'Baywatch' co-star Pamela Anderson piled on.\"David, I have to say, when I saw the video of you lying on the floor -- drunk, broken down, cheeseburger meat falling from your mouth -- I felt so sad,\" said Anderson. \"For that cow.\"Hasselhoff exited the show triumphantly -- we don't want to spoil the ending, but it's awesome. And he even gamely met the press backstage.\"Yeah, it goes too far,\" Hasselhoff said when asked about some of the barbs. \"That's what they want to do. They want to get to everybody.\"He kept a fixed smile on his face throughout and insisted the event was \"therapeutic.\" Hasselhoff had, in his mind, dealt with the video issue once and for all -- and he was still standing.\"No one got me,\" said the Hoff. \"I'm still laughing. My face hurts. I'm sorry it's over.\"Greatest. Actor. Ever.",

    "document": "Malaysia Airlines confirms 6,000 job losses in restructure; CEO says carrier 'technically bankrupt' \n \n Posted \n \n Malaysia Airlines has outlined plans for a major restructure that will see the carrier slash around 6,000 jobs as it struggles to stay in business. \n \n The plan, released on Monday by email, said the airline would begin operations under a new brand on September 1. \n \n About 14,000 of the roughly 20,000 existing employees are expected to receive offer letters to remain with the restructured airline, it said. \n \n Malaysia's national carrier is also expected to pull back drastically from unprofitable long-haul routes such as to Europe, and focus instead on regional traffic as it regroups. \n \n The announcement marks the first concrete move by newly-appointed CEO Christoph Mueller as he seeks to repair the embattled airline's reputation following the loss of two jets in separate disasters in 2014. \n \n \"We are technically bankrupt ... the decline of performance started long before the tragic events of 2014,\" Mr Mueller said, speaking at a news conference. \n \n In March of last year, flight MH370 disappeared with 239 passengers and crew aboard and remains missing. \n \n Four months later, flight MH17 was destroyed by a suspected ground-to-air missile over Ukraine. \n \n The tragedies were the final straw for an airline that analysts say had already been poorly managed for years, slipping further into the red. \n \n Mr Mueller was making his first public appearance as CEO since being hired last month by the carrier's owner, Malaysian state fund Khazanah, to lead the restructuring. \n \n The state investment fund said last year that around 6,000 jobs would be lost. \n \n Monday's announcement said the airline planned to \"stop the bleeding\" in 2015, stabilise next year, and seek to start growing again by 2017. \n \n Analysts have long blamed the airline's failure to compete on poor management, unwise business decisions, government meddling, and unfavourable service and supplier contracts stemming from Malaysia's crony capitalism. \n \n The blueprint called for the renegotiating or resetting of major contracts, and a major revitalisation of technology, training, and business operations. \n \n Mr Mueller warned last month a major overhaul was necessary as the airline was weighed down by \"uncompetitive cost levels\" that he said were 20 per cent higher than its rivals. \n \n AFP \n \n Topics: air-transport, business-economics-and-finance, air-and-space, disasters-and-accidents, malaysia, asia ||||| Image copyright Elvis Image caption The restructuring comes after years of losses and the twin disasters of MH370 and MH17 \n \n Malaysia Airlines is \"technically bankrupt\", its chief executive has said, as he announced a restructuring programme and plans to cut about 6,000 jobs. \n \n The announcement follows the twin air disasters which forced its nationalisation last year. \n \n The airline said it had \"offered jobs\" to 14,000 of its 20,000 workforce. \n \n The move was expected and follows the appointment of new chief executive Christoph Mueller in May. \n \n \"We are technically bankrupt,\" Mr Mueller told a news conference. \"The decline of performance started long before the tragic events of 2014.\" \n \n The airline is operating as normal and no flights are currently affected. \n \n In March last year, Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared with 239 passengers and crew aboard. The plane is still missing. \n \n Four months later, flight MH17 was shot down by a suspected ground-to-air missile while in Ukrainian airspace, with the loss of 298 passengers and crew. \n \n The two disasters proved to be the final straw for the already struggling business, which had reported losses for several years as a result of strong regional competition. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Flight MH370 went missing in March last year \n \n Rebranding \n \n Mr Mueller was making his first public appearance as chief executive since being hired by the carrier's owner, Malaysian state fund Khazanah, to lead the restructuring. \n \n He has previously had senior roles at Ireland's Aer Lingus, Belgium's Sabena and Germany's Lufthansa airlines. Famed for slashing jobs at the airlines, he has earned the nickname \"the Terminator\". \n \n Analysis: Jennifer Pak, BBC Malaysia correspondent: \n \n For more than a decade, Malaysia Airlines lurched from one restructuring to the next, but it was hard for many Malaysian taxpayers to understand the extent of the problem. \n \n In-flight service remained one of the best in the region and up until the twin tragedies of MH370 and MH17, the carrier had a good safety record. \n \n The new chief executive, Christoph Mueller, detailed the structural issues today. \n \n For example, he said Malaysia Airlines management staff were spread out across more than 12 buildings, which meant departments were spending a lot of time to communicate with each other. \n \n He also stated that the airline was \"technically bankrupt\". \n \n Mohshin Aziz, an aviation analyst at Maybank, told the BBC that no management official \"had the balls to admit that\" in the past. \n \n He said the slashing of a third of the work force was a promising sign of real change. \n \n But Mr Mueller doesn't have much time to revive Malaysia's national icon. \n \n British Airways, for example, recently restarted flights from London to Kuala Lumpur, which is Malaysia Airline's flagship route. \n \n I recently flew that route and had a row of four seats to stretch my legs. The staff told me there were plenty of empty seats in the double-decker Airbus A380 aircraft. \n \n Malaysia Airlines faces stiff competition from legacy carriers, as well as low-cost carriers, such as AirAsia X. \n \n Malaysia Airlines had previously disclosed plans to cut 6,000 jobs, shrinking its workforce to 14,000. \n \n Mr Mueller said the airline could not expect that all of the job offers it had made to existing staff would be accepted. He said this was because the company expected staff to have received offers from rival carriers. \n \n \"We will embark on a second round in two weeks' time and that will allow others to accept our offers and that may change the numbers,\" he added. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Flight MH17 came down near the village of Grabove in Ukraine \n \n Malaysia Airlines plans to announce a rebranding on 1 September. Mr Mueller would not be drawn on whether this would mean a change to its name, but said \"all constellations were open\". \n \n He admitted that in certain markets Malaysia Airlines was a tarnished brand, but he would not say whether the rebrand would involve a change in name, logo or other alterations. \n \n He also would not be drawn on whether the airline would withdraw from some costly long-haul flights to Europe. \n \n In more general terms, he said it was possible the airline might reduce the frequency of flights on certain routes, or reduce the size of aircraft on those routes. \n \n The carrier would look at joint ventures before closing routes, Mr Mueller said, and would be having conversations with potential partners in the coming weeks. \n \n The airline considered long-haul flights to and from London to be among its flagship routes, he said, so would not be altering them. \n \n In a statement, the airline said its immediate priority was to \"stop the bleeding\" in 2015, then to stabilise next year and start growing again by 2017. ||||| Malaysia Airlines will have a rebrand in September after a disastrous 2014 \n \n The new boss of Malaysia Airlines has claimed the carrier is \"technically bankrupt\", following two plane accidents in 12 months. \n \n Christoph Mueller has confirmed that 6,000 jobs will be cut at the troubled airline - ahead of a rebrand in September which aims to repair the damage caused by the losses of MH370 and MH17. \n \n CEO Christoph Mueller has turned around other airline brands in the past \n \n Consumer confidence was badly affected when Flight MH370 disappeared with 239 people on board in March 2014, and just four months later, Flight MH17 was downed by a suspected ground-to-air missile over Ukraine - killing 298 people. \n \n The tragedies led to Malaysia Airlines being taken into state ownership and delisted from the stock market, but analysts claim the company has been mismanaged for years - a sentiment echoed by Mr Mueller. \n \n Play video \"2014: Can Malaysia Airlines Endure?\" Video: 2014: Can Malaysia Airlines Endure? \n \n \"The decline of performance started long before the tragic events of 2014,\" he said. \n \n Stiff regional competition has led the company to post losses for several years - and in a statement, the airline pledged to \"stop the bleeding\" in its finances by the end of 2015, in the hope it will return to growth by 2017. \n \n Mr Mueller, nicknamed The Terminator in Ireland for the job cuts he implemented at Aer Lingus, is expected to reduce the number of long-haul routes offered from Malaysia to Europe, and focus on regional services. \n \n However, a \"profitable\" twice-daily service from London Heathrow to Kuala Lumpur is set to continue. \n \n Under the new CEO's plans, Malaysia Airlines' workforce would shrink to 14,000. \n \n The challenges facing the company come amid low jet fuel prices, which are expected to make this year one of the most profitable for the industry since the start of the century. \n \n It is expected that the 12-month restructuring plan for Malaysian Airlines will cost \u00a31.1bn - and last week, an administrator was appointed to oversee the transferral of the carrier's assets to a new company. \n \n Mr Mueller said it was \"business as usual\" despite the disruption - and told passengers all reservations would be honoured, with scheduled flights going ahead as planned.",

Noting the Malaysia Airlines brand has been blemished in some markets, Mueller, hired last month by state investor Khazanah, adds the airline will rebrand in September, but he remains vague on the details. The airline may also reduce the frequency of flights or the size of aircraft on long-haul routes to Europe to focus more on regional flights, though a flagship route to London will be unaltered.

But the tranquil surface masks a disturbing reality, as husband and father Gardner Lodge (Matt Damon) must navigate the town's dark underbelly of betrayal, deceit, and violence. This is a tale of very flawed people making very bad choices. This is Suburbicon. ||||| The talent in front of and behind the camera for George Clooney's latest directorial effort, the 1950's satire \"Suburbicon,\" has accumulated heaps of Oscar gold. But talented, award-winning filmmakers can get it totally, embarrassingly wrong sometimes. There's no other way to say it \u2014 this movie stinks. It is irritating, faux-edgy, tonally wack, strained, unfunny, and such a colossally tone-deaf misfire. \n \n Clooney enlists Julianne Moore to trot out her tired Stepford wife routine, while Matt Damon phones in another iteration of his doltish dork character. But both of their performances just make us think of times when they've done this before, only better. \n \n \"Suburbicon\" is a grotesque Frankenstein's monster stitched together from parts of \"Pleasantville,\" \"Fargo,\" \"Far From Heaven\" and \"The Informant!,\" which are all great films, but this meaningless pastiche has no idea what it actually wants to say. Opening with an advertisement for a cookie-cutter Levittown-style suburb called Suburbicon, we plunge into this world of big hair, big skirts, perfect lawns and nuclear families. It's picture perfection with diversity by way of white families from Ohio and Mississippi. But there's darkness underneath all that sameness. \n \n \"Suburbicon\" fundamentally fails in asking its audience to do two wildly different things at the same time. We're to laugh at a satirical family murder insurance scam, but we're also supposed to feel very sad and solemn about the evils of racism. But you can't mix nihilism and earnestness. It just doesn't work. \n \n Hilary Bronwyn Gayle/AP Julianne Moore plays another Stepford wife in \u201cSuburbicon.\u201d Julianne Moore plays another Stepford wife in \u201cSuburbicon.\u201d (Hilary Bronwyn Gayle/AP) (Hilary Bronwyn Gayle/AP) \n \n Bloody hijinks ensue in half of this movie. Rose (Moore), the wife of square businessman Gardner Lodge (Damon), is murdered in a terrifying home invasion. Her twin sister, Maggie (also Moore), moves in to care for their son, Nicky (Noah Jupe), but the relationship between his dad and aunt instantly seems fishy to the young boy, and things spiral out of control for Gardner. \n \n This absurdist, violent tale is classic Coen Brothers. They originally wrote the script, and their voice is obvious. Clooney and his writing/producing partner Grant Heslov also took a pass, and it's clear that the filmmaker who excels at straightforward, politically engaged efforts like \"Good Night and Good Luck,\" couldn't resist shoehorning in some social commentary about the toxic hegemony of Suburbicon. \n \n Concurrent to the slow family annihilation, we witness the plight of the Meyers family, the first African-American residents in Suburbicon, who are tormented day and night by a racist mob of their neighbors. What is the point of this gross subplot? It's a condescending, critically uninterrogated take on old-timey racism \u2014 are we to feel better that racism is more nuanced and camouflaged now? Mr. Meyers doesn't even get a single line. He's completely voiceless, and we watch this family silently endure this burden for some futile reason. \n \n There are a couple of bright spots: Oscar Isaac brings the energy up as a skeptical insurance agent, while Jupe brings the heart and soul. There are moments where it seems they might have told the whole bloody tale from Nicky's perspective, which would have been interesting, but that's abandoned. \n \n Ultimately \"Suburbicon\" is woefully underwritten. Gardner and Maggie are mere sketches, a set of facial tics and accessories masquerading as real characters. The racism story is so broad it's essentially meaningless, and there are even some glaring continuity errors. \"Suburbicon\" is a shoddy, shameful showing, despite prestigious origins. \n \n \"Suburbicon\" \u2014 1 star \n \n MPAA rating: R for violence, language and some sexuality \n \n Running time: 1:45 \n \n Opens: Friday \n \n RELATED STORIES: \n \n George Clooney and Matt Damon explain what and when they knew about Harvey Weinstein's conduct \n \n 'Faces Places' review: A filmmaker and a photographer hit the road, memorably \n \n 'Wonderstruck' review: Seeing is believing this beguiling riddle set in two eras in NYC \n \n Check out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune. ||||| The perfect veneer of 1950s suburban life is just a mask for the deep rot and hypocrisy festering underneath the trimmed lawns in George Clooney's \"Suburbicon,\" a derivative and somewhat edgeless satire with some compelling performances nonetheless. \n \n Clooney directs a script credited to Joel and Ethan Coen, himself and Grant Heslov about a model community, Suburbicon, that promises a perfect suburban existence: a parcel of property for all, clean and well-stocked grocery stores, no traffic and friendly neighbors. But there's a catch and it is skin deep. \n \n This is a problem when the Meyers family (Karimah Westbrook, Leith M. Burke and Tony Espinosa) moves to town. They are black, you see, and the rest of the community is not thrilled about it \u2014 eyebrows are raised, meetings are held (with interchangeable middle aged white men in flat top haircuts and wire-rimmed glasses shouting at one another through Dutch angle shots). Crowds start to gather outside of the Meyers house until it becomes an all-out mob. \n \n The plight of the Meyers family is just the side story, though, a tacked-on and bluntly conceived commentary on how this community is too distracted by their racist fears to see what's going on next door, where Gardner (Matt Damon), his wheelchair-bound wife and his sister-in-law (both played by Julianne Moore) and his young son, Nicky (Noah Jupe) are terrorized in their own home by two goons with unclear motives. \n \n It's probably best not to say much about how this home invasion spirals and evolves, but it brings a fair amount of intrigue and terrific side characters into the strange orbit of the milquetoast Gardner. There's Gary Basaraba as the empathetic Uncle Mitch, a lumbering and sweet presence who just wants to look after his nephew Nicky. Oscar Isaac, too, steals the show in a brief appearance as a three-steps-ahead insurance agent. Westbrook does wonders as Mrs. Meyers with not much screen time or dialogue, especially in a particularly upsetting scene in a grocery store where a store manager tells her that the price of milk is $20 for her. And the young Jupe proves to be a fantastic and compelling find, carrying much of the film as the hyper-vigilant kid who is watching his world unravel and doing something about it. \n \n The leads are a little more underwhelming, which is perhaps a problem of the script. Damon plays Gardner as a kind of quiet everyman, the type who recedes into the background and goes unnoticed most of the time. Moore is more over-the-top, especially as the sister-in-law Margaret, who strains to be the perfect 50s woman. There are times when they're allowed to play a bit with quirky dialogue that I would assume is thanks to the Coens, like an amusing discussion about Aruba, but these moments are fewer than you might imagine from a Coen-crafted script. \n \n Of all the periods that Clooney could have chosen to skewer, it feels almost toothless to take on 50s suburbia, though. Certainly there are meant to be parallels with today, but it is too obvious to be particularly subversive or revealing, and doesn't even go far enough to satirize the hypocritical social mores of the time. Thus you're left with just the plot, which moves along in a fairly compelling, if predictable way. But what's the point of all this talent and originality and freedom if it's going to feel so much like something we've already seen before? \n \n \"Suburbicon,\" a Paramount Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America for \"violence, language and some sexuality.\" Running time: 104 minutes.

He pops up for a couple of scenes as an insurance investigator halfway through \u201cSuburbicon,\u201d evolves on the spot from mild patience to testy suspicion followed by snide cynicism, then departs with the movie stolen and stuffed into his back pocket. \n \n In a film running a brief 104 minutes, he supplies 90 percent of the entertainment in 5 percent of the time. As for the rest of the project, we\u2019ll get to that. Let\u2019s take a moment first to count our blessings. \n \n Retrofitted on the scaffolding of an old script by Joel and Ethan Coen, \u201cSuburbicon\u201d is a vision of 1950s-era Americana set in a hopeful, wholesome suburban community where everything looks absolutely peachy keen. (Spoiler: It\u2019s not.) It features the Coens\u2019 patented mix-and-match blend of shaggy dog humor and bloody violence, along with a high-minded subplot that aims to give the story contemporary relevance. Featuring Matt Damon and Julianne Moore as the lead actors and George Clooney as director, it\u2019s star-studded top to bottom. \n \n And it\u2019s strikingly bad, too somber to be a comedy and too dizzy to work as drama. \n \n An animated opening sequence introduces us to Suburbicon, an oddly named neighborhood where every new Eisenhower-era home looks like the one next door. Those cookie-cutter developments, made famous by the legendary Levittown, Pa., development of single-family tract houses, promised the returning veterans of World War II affordable tranquillity away from the pollution, noise and crime of the big city. \n \n A happy mailman (this is back when they were still called mailmen) demonstrates how cheery life is in Suburbicon. He smiles at every door \u2014 until he meets the newest residents, the hamlet\u2019s only black family. He steps back with a forced, frozen smile and bids them farewell in a textbook case of passive aggression. \n \n Suburbicon \u2605 out of 4 stars Rating: R for violence, language and some sexuality. \n \n This is pretty accurate. By 1953, Levittown constituted the largest racially restricted community in the United States, with 70,000 people and no black residents. The policy of racial exclusivity came from the developers and remained in place until the Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional more than a decade later. \n \n That being said, however, it matters not if the back story is true. A Coenesque crime comedy is an awkward venue for exploring weighty social issues, and it\u2019s hard to watch this misbegotten farce without wishing that Clooney and collaborator Grant Heslov (who has assisted on the scripts of other Clooney projects, including \u201cThe Monuments Men\u201d and \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck\u201d) had decided to focus exclusively on the caper or the commentary. \n \n The film is a collision of tones that would put a demolition derby to shame. Damon plays Gardner Lodge, a plain vanilla 1950s father with a secret life who is going through a midlife crisis and then some. His wife (Moore, who also plays the woman\u2019s twin) is murdered. Their young son Nicky (Noah Jupe) gets even more traumatized when he concludes that his father and aunt (Moore again) are hiding something about the homicide. As usual in the Coen world, the best laid plans of imbeciles go awry, and characters are soon beating, stabbing, poisoning and killing one another in car crashes. \n \n As distressing as this all sounds, it\u2019s the kind of foul play the Coens could turn to zany fun in their own film. But in Clooney\u2019s hands (remember \u201cLeatherheads\u201d or \u201cConfessions of a Dangerous Mind\u201d?), it\u2019s even worse than it sounds. \n \n Yet, it\u2019s the disconnected subplot about the suburb\u2019s new black residents, menaced by mobs at their home, right across from the Lodge residence, that seems like the biggest strategic error. Both sides of the film lift up a rock to expose the wormy things crawling beneath, neither in a way that\u2019s dramatically effective. \n \n Fortunately, we\u2019ve still got Isaac (the title character in the Coens\u2019 \u201cInside Llewyn Davis\u201d) as the hilarious investigator. They\u2019ll never take that away from us. \n \n Colin.Covert@startribune.com \n \n 612-673-7186 \n \n Twitter: @colincovert",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 You'd think only good fun could come from George Clooney directing Matt Damon in Suburbicon. Apparently not so. The satire touching on murder, fraud, and also racism in 1950s suburbia has just a 29% rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Here's what they're saying. \"There's no other way to say it\u2014this movie stinks,\" writes Katie Walsh at Tribune News Service, throwing out a long list of adjectives: \"irritating, faux-edgy, tonally wack, strained, unfunny,\" along with \"shoddy, shameful.\" She complains in particular about a racism subplot that comes across as \"condescending\" and says the film fails by wanting us to do two things\u2014feel upset about that subplot while finding hilarity in a \"satirical family murder insurance scam. ... You can't mix nihilism and earnestness.\" Lindsey Bahr calls Suburbicon \"a derivative and somewhat edgeless satire with some compelling performances nonetheless.\" Gary Basaraba and Oscar Isaac, specifically, are impressive, Bahr writes at the AP. But Damon and Julianne Moore aren't up to snuff. Nor is the story itself, which \"doesn't even go far enough to satirize the hypocritical social mores of the time.\" The result feels \"so much like something we've already seen before.\" Chris Klimek was impressed with Damon, Moore, as well as Isaac and child actor Noah Jupe. Too bad they're in a \"tone-deaf\u201d film that's \"queasy to sit through,\" he writes at NPR. In condemning racism \"in the most broad, perfunctory, awareness-ribbon-wearing way while barely allowing its black characters to speak \u2026 Suburbicon might be the biggest embarrassment to pious Hollywood liberalism since Crash won best picture in 2006,\" he writes. Colin Covert identifies the main problem as the reworking of Joel and Ethan Coen's script by Clooney and Grant Heslov, who should have made either a crime comedy or a piece of social commentary, but not both. Instead, Clooney made a film that's \"strikingly bad, too somber to be a comedy and too dizzy to work as drama,\" Covert writes at the Minneapolis Star Tribune. He does applaud Isaac, though. \"In a film running a brief 104 minutes, he supplies 90% of the entertainment in 5% of the time.\"",

    "document": "When President Donald Trump took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Friday morning, he clearly wanted to have some fun. \n \n \u201cYou don\u2019t mind if I go off script a little bit?\u201d he asked the rowdy audience in Maryland. His prepared CPAC speech, after all, was \u201ca little boring,\u201d he said. \n \n For more than an hour, Trump held court, largely eschewing a teleprompter filled with prepared remarks on North Korea sanctions and remembrances for Billy Graham and the victims of the Parkland, Fla. shooting, instead choosing to ramble enthusiastically about familiar themes in his typical campaign style. (In fact, new sanctions on North Korea were supposed to be a major part of his CPAC speech, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin scheduled to give a briefing on the news Friday morning. But Trump barely mentioned them, giving them just a brief nod at the tail end of nearly one hour and 15 minutes onstage.) \n \n Early in his CPAC speech, Trump caught a glimpse of himself in a TV monitor and joked, \u201cI try like hell to hide the bald spot,\u201d turning around to show the audience the back of his head. He said his \u201cadministration has had the most successful first year in the history of the presidency,\u201d touting the passage of the tax bill, confirmation of a record-number of circuit court judges and moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem as some primary accomplishments. \n \n And he returned to his election victory in 2016, criticizing the media and saying winning the electoral college is \u201cmuch tougher\u201d than winning the popular vote. (He did not win the popular vote.) The CPAC crowd started a robust chant of \u201clock her up!\u201d when Trump mentioned Democrat Hillary Clinton, to which Trump responded that the Clintons have \u201ccommitted a lot of atrocities.\u201d \n \n In another callback to his time on the campaign trail, Trump read the lyrics to Johnny Rivers\u2019 \u201cThe Snake,\u201d a song from the 1960s that tells of a woman taking in an injured snake, who then bites her, chiding her, \u201cYou knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.\u201d He would often read it at campaign events talking about crimes committed by immigrants. \n \n As Trump pulled the printed lyrics out of his pocket Friday morning, he instructed his audience explicitly, \u201cYou have to think of this in terms of immigration.\u201d \n \n During the off-script portion of his hour on the CPAC stage, Trump also tried to motivate the crowd for the November midterm elections \u2013 saying that if Democrats win, \u201cthey\u2019ll take away your Second Amendment.\u201d He asked the crowd to cheer for whether they\u2019d rather have the Second Amendment right to bear arms or the tax cuts he passed last year, and the applause signaled a win for the Second Amendment. He didn\u2019t mention the shooting in Florida that took the lives of 17 people until later in his CPAC speech, when he temporarily returned to prepared remarks. \n \n Friday morning gave Trump the opportunity to flex his freewheeling campaign rhetoric in front of a supportive live audience. It\u2019s what he seems to enjoy the most about his late-in-life career switch to politics, and it\u2019s what he gets far less of as Commander-in-Chief than he did as an outsider candidate. \n \n He seemed excited to talk about upcoming midterm elections, asking Republicans not to get \u201ccomplacent\u201d during the midterms. And looking ahead to winning a second term in 2020, Trump said, \u201cHopefully we\u2019re going to do that very easily.\u201d ||||| Midterm campaign Trump debuts at CPAC The president abandoned his talking points in his speech to conservative activists in favor of reviving greatest-hits lines from his campaign. \n \n President Donald Trump abandoned a scripted speech to conservatives on Friday to launch into a greatest hits roster of lines from his 2016 campaign, marking a return to candidate mode as he begins campaigning for Republicans in the midterm elections. \n \n The speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference was supposed to highlight tax cuts and sanctions targeting North Korea, but veered instead to familiar tropes, including his victory over \u201ccrooked\u201d Hillary Clinton and a spirited reading of \u201cThe Snake,\u201d an allegorical song that candidate Trump used frequently to illustrate dangers posed by undocumented immigrants. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n It was a departure from the slightly more controlled, presidential Trump \u2014 who was back in evidence at the White House later in the day speaking alongside Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull \u2014 and a sign that the president plans to lean heavily on what\u2019s worked for him in the past as he tries to boost Republicans in the November elections. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s now his party. It\u2019s now his conservative movement and there are no challengers. This was like a victory speech,\u201d said Ed Rollins, lead strategist for the pro-Trump Great America super PAC. \u201cIt was the kickoff to the 2018 campaign \u2014 and the 2020.\u201d \n \n Calling his first 365 days \u201cthe most successful first year in the history of the presidency\u201d, Trump went off script to rattle through a list of superlative achievements \u2014 the \u201cbiggest\u201d tax cuts, \u201cheaviest\u201d sanctions and record firearms prosecutions. \n \n The most reliable politics newsletter.

Going into this year\u2019s midterms, it\u2019s far from certain that Trump, or the party, can translate those accomplishments into congressional gains. \n \n Democrats are defending 25 Senate seats, including 10 in states that supported Trump over Clinton in 2016, compared with Republicans\u2019 eight. Still, Democrats hope to capitalize on Trump\u2019s low approval ratings, scandals and an investigation into Russian campaign meddling to pare or eliminate Republican majorities in the House and Senate. \n \n As Trump basked in CPAC\u2019s friendly glow, a former campaign aide, Rick Gates, was pleading guilty to charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller in a deal that requires Gates to cooperate with Mueller's prosecution of Paul Manafort, Gates' former business partner and Trump\u2019s onetime chairman. \n \n \u201cHe made it very clear he\u2019s going to campaign very aggressively in 2018,\u201d Rollins said. \u201cWhether that\u2019s good or bad we\u2019ll find out.\u201d \n \n Trump urged the audience \u2014 about 1,000 people \u2014 not to get complacent. \n \n \u201cWe have a problem: We need more Republicans,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to worry \u2014 right now, we have a big race coming up in '18. You have to get out. You have to just get that enthusiasm. Keep it going.\u201d \n \n \u201cIf they get in, they will repeal your tax cuts, they will put judges in that you wouldn't believe, they'll take away your Second Amendment, which we will never allow to happen,\u201d Trump said. \n \n Excerpts of the speech released before Trump took the stage suggested he would spotlight his administration\u2019s announcement of sanctions on North Korea, advertised as the \u201cLARGEST EVER.\u201d But Trump mentioned the sanctions only as he wound up his remarks, and only, he said, \u201cbecause people have asked\u201d \u2014 without including details. \n \n Trump\u2019s Friday address marked the second consecutive year he spoke at the CPAC summit. With the president\u2019s conservative bona fides now cemented, the venue this year became an important event for rallying his base. \n \n CPAC is organized by American Conservative Union head Matt Schlapp, whose wife, Mercedes Schlapp, is a White House adviser for strategic communications. \n \n Trump had a lukewarm welcome at CPAC last year. This year the president owned the crowd, but the gathering prompted furious debate among conservatives for its Trump-friendly list of speakers, which included Sebastian Gorka, a former White House aide and alt-right hero, and Marion Le Pen, the niece of French National Front Party chief Marine Le Pen. \n \n Yesterday, Trump stuck to his conservative message. A week after a deadly school shooting that killed 17 in Parkland, Florida, he gave little ground on gun control. He called for an end to gun-free school zones and said teachers should be armed. \n \n \u201cWell-trained, gun-adept teachers and coaches should be able to carry concealed firearms,\u201d Trump said. \u201cA teacher would have shot the hell out of him before he knew what happened.\u201d \n \n The president touted his deregulatory agenda and claimed that \u201cObamacare is just being wiped out\u201d after Congress repealed a requirement that individuals carry health insurance. \n \n The president also paid homage to Billy Graham, the prominent American pastor and longtime presidential adviser who passed away this week at 99. \n \n \u201cWe will never forget the historic crowds, the voice, the energy, and the profound faith of a preacher named Billy Graham,\u201d Trump said. ||||| President Trump Donald John TrumpWhite House revises statement saying Iran 'has' secret nuclear weapons program DOJ files charges against 11 suspected 'caravan' members for illegal border crossing Mueller planned to ask Trump about Manafort's campaign outreach to Moscow: report MORE told the Conservative Political Action Committee on Friday that if Democrats come into power, they will \u201ctake away your Second Amendment.\u201d \n \n \u201cThey'll take away your Second Amendment,\u201d Trump said. \u201cRemember that.\u201d \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n Speaking a little more than a week after the shooting at a Florida high school that left 17 dead one day after he offered support for modest gun control proposals, Trump offered some red meat for the conservative crowd and vowed to protect gun rights. \n \n Cheered on by the crowd, Trump told the audience that they must come out in force to beat history and prevent the GOP from losing congressional seats in this fall's midterms to Democrats. The president's party typically loses seats in a midterm election. \n \n \"Don't be complacent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIf they get in, they will repeal your tax cuts, they will put judges in that you wouldn't believe, they'll take away your Second Amendment, which we will never allow to happen.\u201d \n \n \n \n Trump broke from the script to ask the crowd which one they would prefer to keep: tax cuts or gun rights. The crowd exploded with cheers about protecting their gun rights. \n \n \n \n Trump is walking a fine line with conservatives and the National Rifle Association (NRA), one of his biggest backers during his presidential campaign. \n \n The president is advocating for several new policies that put him at odds with the NRA, including expanded background checks, higher age restrictions on gun purchases and banning a device, known as a bump stock, that enables semi-automatic rifles to fire more rapidly. \n \n \n \n But the president said he\u2019s been in contact with the NRA and that they\u2019ll get on board with some of his proposals. \n \n \n \n \u201cI can speak for all of the senators and congressmen and congresswomen, all the people in this room that are involved in this decision, that we will act, we will do something,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will act.\u201d \n \n \n \n Democrats are eager to achieve broader gun control measures and say Trump\u2019s proposals do not go far enough. \n \n \n \n The president is also proposing arming some school officials so they can fight back against active shooters, which many gun control activists oppose. \n \n \n \n \u201cWhy do we protect our airports and our banks, our government buildings, but not our schools?,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt is time to make our schools a much harder target for attackers. We don't want them in our schools. We don't want them.

For Trump, going off script mostly meant getting back to some of his favorite rally topics: the size of his election victory, having \"the most successful first year in the history of the presidency,\" and \"atrocities\" committed by the Clintons (complete with chants of \"lock her up\"). The president warned of the danger and treachery of immigrants, reciting The Snake by Al Wilson. Trump regularly recited lyrics from the 1960s song during his campaign. It culminates with the line, \"You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.\" Trump also addressed the topic of the moment: guns. \"When we declare our schools to be gun-free zones it just puts our students in more danger, far more danger\u2014well-trained gun-adept teachers and coaches should be able to carry concealed firearms,\" Politico quotes Trump as saying. Repeating his call to arm teachers, he added: \u201cA teacher would have shot the hell out of [the Parkland shooter] before he knew what happened.\" Trump tried to fire up the audience for the 2018 midterms, warning them not to get complacent and allow Democrats to take control of Congress, the Hill reports. \u201cIf they get in, they will repeal your tax cuts, they will put judges in that you wouldn't believe, they'll take away your Second Amendment, which we will never allow to happen.\u201d",

He used the line, \"You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in,\" and told the crowd, \"You have to think of this in terms of immigration.\" Other highlights from the speech: \"My administration has had the most successful first year in the history of the presidency,\" Trump said, touting accomplishments including the tax bill, the confirmation of a record-number of circuit court judges, and moving the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He returned to his election victory in 2016, criticizing the media and saying winning the electoral college is \"much tougher\" than winning the popular vote. The CPAC crowd started a robust chant of \"lock her up!\" when Trump mentioned Hillary Clinton, to which Trump responded that the Clintons have \"committed a lot of atrocities.\" In another callback to his time on the campaign trail, Trump read the lyrics to Johnny Rivers' \"The Snake,\" a song from the 1960s that tells of a woman taking in an injured snake, who then bites her, \"You knew damn well I was a snake before you took me in.\"",

The letter accused the bureau of deliberately undermining requests to look into Zacarias Moussaoui , the only person convicted in the United States of playing a role in the attacks. She testified in front of Congress and the 9/11 Commission about the FBI's mishandling of information.

More than 4,000 Enron employees lost their jobs, and many also lost their life savings, when the energy giant declared bankruptcy in 2001. Investors lost billions of dollars.

His main objective was to get the information about the level of surveillance out into the public domain and then beyond that, he didn't care.\" \n \n Snowden's revelations fueled new debate about the U.S. government's collection of records of domestic telephone calls and overseas Internet activity in the global hunt for terrorists and criminals. Supporters of the programs say they are legal and have yielded evidence that has helped put terror plotters in prison, though many of the details remain classified. \n \n Obama administration officials and leaders of the intelligence committees in Congress say the program undergoes periodic review by all three branches of government, and that the content of Americans' calls is not being monitored. \n \n White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday the measures are a necessary middle way between total privacy and unacceptable threat. He said President Barack Obama would be willing to consider changes should a national debate show the public wants them -- but he wryly noted, \"This is not the manner by which he hoped to have the debate.\" \n \n \"What I can tell you is that the programs are judged by the president and by his national security team to be necessary and effective. They are also accorded oversight by all three branches of government, as is appropriate, and it is also the case that these programs and the general principle about finding the balance between our security interests and our need and desire for privacy is something that we should constantly engage in. \n \n U.S. Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, called Snowden \"a defector\" who should be turned over to the United States with an eye toward harsh prosecution. \n \n \"This person is dangerous to the country,\" King said on CNN's \"Starting Point\" on Monday. \n \n Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, fumed that Snowden committed \"an act of treason,\" while Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein questioned whether his access to government secrets was as extensive as he claims. \n \n \"I listened carefully to what he said, and what he said is, you know, 'I can get access to where every asset is in the world and their stations and their missions,' and I've been told that isn't possible,\" said Feinstein, D-California. \n \n She added, \"I don't really have any way of knowing how adept he is in the computer world. ... I can't say he's overstating anything in these programs. Maybe he's overstating his prowess.\" \n \n But Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian columnist who was the lead author on last week's stories, told CNN's \"The Lead\" that Snowden has revealed secrets that were being kept only from American citizens. \n \n \"Terrorists already know the U.S. government tries to surveil their communications,\" Greenwald said. \"Nothing that we revealed helps, quote-unquote, the terrorists. All we did was tell our fellow citizens of the United States and around the world the extent and capabilities of how vast the surveillance state is and the reasons why it needs scrutiny and accountability. And the only things we damaged are the reputation of American political officials, not national security.\" \n \n Greenwald said he knew \"generally\" where Snowden has gone, but added, \"I'm not going to disclose information about his whereabouts.

Hong Kong's extradition treaty with the United States has exceptions for political crimes and cases when handing over a criminal suspect would harm the \"defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy\" of either party. \n \n \"I think he looked around, this seemed the safest bet,\" said MacAskill. \n \n Snowden hopes to get asylum, he added, with Iceland his first choice because of the way it dealt with WikiLeaks, a group that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website. The group reportedly once operated from there. \n \n Kristin Arnadottir, Iceland's ambassador to China, said Icelandic law requires asylum applications to be made from inside the country. \n \n WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, bottled up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since last June, said Snowden should be looking to the southeast, not northwest. \n \n \"I would strongly advise him to go to Latin America,\" Assange told CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\" on Monday night. \"Latin America has shown in the past 10 years that it is really pushing forward in human rights. There's a long tradition of asylum.\" \n \n Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorian mission to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. He has repeatedly said the allegations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website. \n \n Assange has said he fears Sweden will transfer him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty if he were charged with and convicted of a crime. Though no U.S. charges are pending, WikiLeaks source Bradley Manning is being court-martialed on charges that he aided U.S. enemies by leaking documents he obtained as a U.S. Army intelligence analyst. \n \n If Snowden is charged and brought back to the United States, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee started a campaign to raise funds for his legal defense. The group promotes progressive causes and candidates, its website says. \n \n Snowden's revelations began Wednesday when the Guardian published a top secret court order demanding that Verizon Business Network Services turn over details of phone calls published from April 25 to July 19. Intelligence officials later confirmed the program, which analysts say likely covers all U.S. carriers. \n \n On Thursday, the Guardian and the Post disclosed the existence of PRISM, a program they said allows NSA analysts to extract the details of people's online activities -- including \"audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents\" and other materials -- from computers at Microsoft, Google, Apple and other Internet firms. \n \n Intelligence officials similarly confirmed that program's existence, but said it targets only overseas residents who are not U.S. citizens. \n \n On Friday, Obama said he entered office skeptical of such programs but decided to reauthorize them after a thorough vetting and the addition of unspecified additional safeguards. He called them only \"modest encroachments on privacy\" that help thwart terror attacks. \n \n Copying secrets \n \n Before joining Booz Allen Hamilton, which provides support technology and computer support to the government, Snowden worked for the CIA, he told the newspaper. \n \n He told the Guardian he worked for the consulting firm in Hawaii, holding down a $200,000-a-year job that gave him easy access to a vast trove of sensitive data. \n \n \"The NSA has built an infrastructure that allows it to intercept almost everything,\" he told the newspaper. \"With this capability, the vast majority of human communications are automatically ingested without targeting. If I wanted to see your e-mails or your wife's phone, all I have to do is use intercepts. I can get your e-mails, passwords, phone records, credit cards.\" \n \n In a statement released Sunday, Booz Allen Hamilton said Snowden had worked for the company for less than three months. The report that he had leaked American secrets was \"shocking\" and if true, \"represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm,\" the company said. \n \n Strange bedfellows \n \n Snowden's actions, while opposed by many, have also brought together some liberals and conservatives to hail him as a hero. \n \n Liberal activist and filmmaker Michael Moore tweeted that Snowden is \"HERO OF THE YEAR.\" Conservative commentator Glenn Beck, meanwhile, called Snowden a \"patriot leaker\" who could help America \"regain her moral compass.\" \n \n Daniel Ellsberg, who in the 1970s leaked the Pentagon Papers documents showing the government had lied about the progress of the Vietnam War, said Snowden had done the country an \"enormous service.\" And in Congress, Democratic senators such as Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado have warned about the dangers of excessive surveillance as vociferously as Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky. \n \n On the other side, Feinstein joined Republicans such as Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Rep. Mike Rogers in defending the surveillance programs. \n \n They point to what they say are the program's successes, including charges against an Afghan-born Colorado man who pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb targets in New York, and David Headley, who was accused of conducting advance surveillance for the Pakistani jihadists who attacked hotels and other targets in Mumbai, India, in 2008, killing 164 people. Both men pleaded guilty. \n \n Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC's \"This Week\" that the \"inflammatory nature\" of the accusations doesn't fit with how the program actually operates. \n \n \"The instances where this has produced good -- has disrupted plots, prevented terrorist attacks -- is all classified,\" said Rogers, R-Michigan. \"That's what's so hard about this.\" ||||| Story highlights Forget Hong Kong, go to Latin America, Assange advises \n \n Computer forensics will be a big part of any case, ex-FBI official says \n \n Obama open to changes if debate leads to consensus, spokesman says \n \n One senator calls it 'treason,' another questions Snowden's access \n \n The White House said Monday it welcomes a debate over the electronic surveillance programs exposed by a National Security Agency contractor, even as federal agents began building a case against the self-proclaimed leaker. \n \n Edward Snowden told the British newspaper the Guardian that he left behind his family and a six-figure job in Hawaii to reveal the extent of the NSA's collection of telephone and Internet data, which he called \"an existential threat to democracy.\" The 29-year-old worked for computer consultant Booz Allen Hamilton, a contractor for the U.S. electronic intelligence agency. \n \n Snowden said he expects to be prosecuted for the leak, and a federal law enforcement official said Monday that FBI agents have begun an investigation by searching the 29-year-old's home and computers and seeking interviews with his girlfriend, relatives, friends and co-workers. \n \n Snowden outed himself Sunday in the Guardian, which began publishing details of his revelations last week.

In 2002 she fired off a 13-page letter to FBI Director Robert Mueller and flew to Washington to hand-deliver copies to two members of the Senate Intelligence Committee and meet with committee staffers. The letter accused the bureau of deliberately undermining requests to look into Zacarias Moussaoui , the only person convicted in the United States of playing a role in the attacks. She testified in front of Congress and the 9/11 Commission about the FBI's mishandling of information. Rowley was selected as one of Time magazine's People of the Year in 2002 , along with whistle-blowers Sherron Watkins of Enron and Cynthia Cooper of WorldCom.

The memo eventually reached the public and she later testified before Congress about her concerns and the company's wrongdoings. More than 4,000 Enron employees lost their jobs, and many also lost their life savings, when the energy giant declared bankruptcy in 2001. Investors lost billions of dollars. An investigation in 2002 found that Enron executives reaped millions of dollars from off-the-books partnerships and violated basic rules of accounting and ethics.

The news caused an immediate uproar on Capitol Hill and the TSA retreated, withdrawing the scheduling cuts before they went into effect.

Darby eventually alerted the U.S. military command, triggering an investigation and global outrage when the scandal came to light in 2004. Graner was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his part in the abuse. He was released in 2011 after serving 6\u00bd years of his sentence. The military and members of Darby's own family ostracized him, calling him a traitor. Eventually he and his wife had to enter protective custody.

Bush authorized the U.S. National Security Agency to eavesdrop without a court warrant on people in the United States, including American citizens, suspected of communicating with al Qaeda members overseas. The Bush administration staunchly defended the controversial surveillance program. Russ Tice, an NSA insider, came forward as one of the anonymous sources used by the Times. He said he was concerned about alleged abuses and a lack of oversight. Here, President Bush participates in a conversation about the Patriot Act in Buffalo, New York, in April 2004.

His main objective was to get the information about the level of surveillance out into the public domain and then beyond that, he didn't care.\" \n \n Snowden's revelations fueled new debate about the U.S. government's collection of records of domestic telephone calls and overseas Internet activity in the global hunt for terrorists and criminals. Supporters of the programs say they are legal and have yielded evidence that has helped put terror plotters in prison, though many of the details remain classified. \n \n Obama administration officials and leaders of the intelligence committees in Congress say the program undergoes periodic review by all three branches of government, and that the content of Americans' calls is not being monitored. \n \n White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday the measures are a necessary middle way between total privacy and unacceptable threat. He said President Barack Obama would be willing to consider changes should a national debate show the public wants them -- but he wryly noted, \"This is not the manner by which he hoped to have the debate.\" \n \n \"What I can tell you is that the programs are judged by the president and by his national security team to be necessary and effective. They are also accorded oversight by all three branches of government, as is appropriate, and it is also the case that these programs and the general principle about finding the balance between our security interests and our need and desire for privacy is something that we should constantly engage in. \n \n U.S. Rep. Peter King, chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, called Snowden \"a defector\" who should be turned over to the United States with an eye toward harsh prosecution. \n \n \"This person is dangerous to the country,\" King said on CNN's \"Starting Point\" on Monday. \n \n Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, fumed that Snowden committed \"an act of treason,\" while Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein questioned whether his access to government secrets was as extensive as he claims. \n \n \"I listened carefully to what he said, and what he said is, you know, 'I can get access to where every asset is in the world and their stations and their missions,' and I've been told that isn't possible,\" said Feinstein, D-California. \n \n She added, \"I don't really have any way of knowing how adept he is in the computer world. ... I can't say he's overstating anything in these programs.

All we did was tell our fellow citizens of the United States and around the world the extent and capabilities of how vast the surveillance state is and the reasons why it needs scrutiny and accountability. And the only things we damaged are the reputation of American political officials, not national security.\" \n \n Greenwald said he knew \"generally\" where Snowden has gone, but added, \"I'm not going to disclose information about his whereabouts.

Hong Kong's extradition treaty with the United States has exceptions for political crimes and cases when handing over a criminal suspect would harm the \"defense, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy\" of either party. \n \n \"I think he looked around, this seemed the safest bet,\" said MacAskill. \n \n Snowden hopes to get asylum, he added, with Iceland his first choice because of the way it dealt with WikiLeaks, a group that facilitates the anonymous leaking of secret information through its website. The group reportedly once operated from there. \n \n Kristin Arnadottir, Iceland's ambassador to China, said Icelandic law requires asylum applications to be made from inside the country. \n \n WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, bottled up in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since last June, said Snowden should be looking to the southeast, not northwest. \n \n \"I would strongly advise him to go to Latin America,\" Assange told CNN's \"Anderson Cooper 360\" on Monday night. \"Latin America has shown in the past 10 years that it is really pushing forward in human rights. There's a long tradition of asylum.\" \n \n Assange sought refuge in the Ecuadorian mission to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another. He has repeatedly said the allegations in Sweden are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website. \n \n Assange has said he fears Sweden will transfer him to the United States, where he could face the death penalty if he were charged with and convicted of a crime. Though no U.S. charges are pending, WikiLeaks source Bradley Manning is being court-martialed on charges that he aided U.S. enemies by leaking documents he obtained as a U.S. Army intelligence analyst. \n \n If Snowden is charged and brought back to the United States, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee started a campaign to raise funds for his legal defense. The group promotes progressive causes and candidates, its website says. \n \n Snowden's revelations began Wednesday when the Guardian published a top secret court order demanding that Verizon Business Network Services turn over details of phone calls published from April 25 to July 19. Intelligence officials later confirmed the program, which analysts say likely covers all U.S. carriers. \n \n On Thursday, the Guardian and the Post disclosed the existence of PRISM, a program they said allows NSA analysts to extract the details of people's online activities -- including \"audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents\" and other materials -- from computers at Microsoft, Google, Apple and other Internet firms. \n \n Intelligence officials similarly confirmed that program's existence, but said it targets only overseas residents who are not U.S. citizens. \n \n On Friday, Obama said he entered office skeptical of such programs but decided to reauthorize them after a thorough vetting and the addition of unspecified additional safeguards. He called them only \"modest encroachments on privacy\" that help thwart terror attacks. \n \n Copying secrets \n \n Before joining Booz Allen Hamilton, which provides support technology and computer support to the government, Snowden worked for the CIA, he told the newspaper. \n \n He told the Guardian he worked for the consulting firm in Hawaii, holding down a $200,000-a-year job that gave him easy access to a vast trove of sensitive data. \n \n \"The NSA has built an infrastructure that allows it to intercept almost everything,\" he told the newspaper. \"With this capability, the vast majority of human communications are automatically ingested without targeting. If I wanted to see your e-mails or your wife's phone, all I have to do is use intercepts. I can get your e-mails, passwords, phone records, credit cards.\" \n \n In a statement released Sunday, Booz Allen Hamilton said Snowden had worked for the company for less than three months. The report that he had leaked American secrets was \"shocking\" and if true, \"represents a grave violation of the code of conduct and core values of our firm,\" the company said. \n \n Strange bedfellows \n \n Snowden's actions, while opposed by many, have also brought together some liberals and conservatives to hail him as a hero. \n \n Liberal activist and filmmaker Michael Moore tweeted that Snowden is \"HERO OF THE YEAR.\" Conservative commentator Glenn Beck, meanwhile, called Snowden a \"patriot leaker\" who could help America \"regain her moral compass.\" \n \n Daniel Ellsberg, who in the 1970s leaked the Pentagon Papers documents showing the government had lied about the progress of the Vietnam War, said Snowden had done the country an \"enormous service.\" And in Congress, Democratic senators such as Ron Wyden of Oregon and Mark Udall of Colorado have warned about the dangers of excessive surveillance as vociferously as Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky. \n \n On the other side, Feinstein joined Republicans such as Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Rep. Mike Rogers in defending the surveillance programs. \n \n They point to what they say are the program's successes, including charges against an Afghan-born Colorado man who pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb targets in New York, and David Headley, who was accused of conducting advance surveillance for the Pakistani jihadists who attacked hotels and other targets in Mumbai, India, in 2008, killing 164 people. Both men pleaded guilty. \n \n Rogers, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told ABC's \"This Week\" that the \"inflammatory nature\" of the accusations doesn't fit with how the program actually operates. \n \n \"The instances where this has produced good -- has disrupted plots, prevented terrorist attacks -- is all classified,\" said Rogers, R-Michigan. \"That's what's so hard about this.\" ||||| Edward Snowden's choice of Hong Kong as a haven from where to leak intelligence documents and to unmask himself as a whistleblower rests on calculations on the territory's press freedom safeguards and its extradition treaty with the US. It is a high-stakes gamble. \n \n Just before sovereignty over Hong Kong passed from Britain to China in 1997, the US signed a new extradition treaty with the semi-autonomous territory. Under that treaty, both parties agree to hand over fugitives from each other's criminal justice systems, but either side has the right of refusal in the case of political offences. \n \n Beijing, which gave its consent for Hong Kong to sign the agreement, also has a right of veto if it believes the surrender of a fugitive would harm the \"defence, foreign affairs or essential public interest or policy'' of the People's Republic of China. In short, the treaty makes Snowden's fate a matter of political expediency not just in Hong Kong but in Beijing. \n \n In his Guardian interview, Snowden denied that his decision to fly to Hong Kong to make his allegations on NSA intrusion and infringement of American civil liberties was intended as a vote of confidence in Chinese human rights. But he noted that the people of Hong Kong have \"a spirited commitment to free speech and the right of political dissent\". \n \n Certainly in comparison with mainland China, Hong Kong is an island of press freedom and political tolerance. When the UK ended 156 years of colonial rule and Hong Kong became China's first 'special administrative region', it was given special status under the principle of \"one country, two systems\". Most importantly, Hong Kong has its own constitution, its Basic Law, giving it a \"high degree of autonomy\" on all issues except foreign relations and defence. \n \n The territory has multi-party politics but its chief executive is chosen by an election committee of just a few hundred electors. The freedom of the Hong Kong press, meanwhile, is being continually put to the test. When the government attempted in 2003 to impose restrictions on the grounds of sedition and national security, half a million people came out to demonstrate and the bill was withdrawn. \n \n The tradition of commemorating the 1989 killing of Tiananmen Square demonstrators \u2013 banned in the rest of China \u2013 is vigorously upheld in Hong Kong. Attendance at a memorial ceremony in the territory's Victoria Park last week was estimated at between 54,000 and 150,000, despite torrential rain. \n \n The combination of a comparatively liberal civic culture and the sovereignty of Beijing, America's great Pacific rival with which it has an often testy relationship, seems to have been a factor in Snowden's choice of Hong Kong. It may play to his advantage that Presidents Barack Obama and Xi Jinping reportedly agreed to differ on cybersecurity issues in their weekend summit in California. Against this background, Snowden's extradition might be seen in the party leadership in Beijing as a capitulation. But such calculations can change. \n \n \"Call me naive but I think this is going to come down to how Beijing wants to play this,\" Josh Marshall argued on his Talking Points Memo blog. \"If they don't want a fight over this, Snowden's toast. If they like the optics of it, I don't think it matters what that extradition treaty says. China's a big enough player and the US has enough other fish to fry with the Chinese, that the US is not going to put the bilateral relationship on the line over this guy.\" \n \n \u2022 This article was amended on 28 June 2013 to amend a reference to Hong Kong passing its own Basic Law.",

Hong Kong has an extradition treaty with the US, though Beijing maintains the right of veto over it, notes the Guardian, calling Snowden's move a \"high-stakes gamble\" that makes his fate \"a matter of political expediency.\" What's more, CNN adds that hotel costs will soon max out Snowden's limited funds.

    "document": "Davis discloses terminating pregnancy in her memoir \n \n AUSTIN - Sen. Wendy Davis, in her memoir due out next week, discloses the most personal of stories preceding her nationally marked fight against tighter abortion restrictions: a decision she and her then-husband made 17 years ago to end a much-wanted pregnancy. \n \n The book, \u201cForgetting to Be Afraid,\u201d goes on sale to the general public Tuesday. Copies will be available Monday at a Fort Worth book signing by Davis, the Democratic nominee for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott. \n \n Davis, in a copy of the book obtained by the San Antonio Express-News, wrote that her unborn third daughter had an acute brain abnormality. She said doctors told her the syndrome would cause the baby to suffer and likely was incompatible with life. \n \n After getting several medical opinions and feeling the baby they had named Tate Elise \u201ctremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her\u201d in the womb, she said the decision was clear. \n \n \u201cShe was suffering,\u201d Davis wrote. \n \n The unborn baby's heart was \u201cquieted\u201d by her doctor, and their baby was gone. She was delivered by cesarean section in spring 1997, the memoir says. \n \n Davis wrote that she and her then-husband, Jeff, spent time with Tate the next day and had her baptized. They cried, took photographs and said their good-byes, she wrote, and Tate's lifeless body was taken away the following day. \n \n \u201cAn indescribable blackness followed. It was a deep, dark despair and grief, a heavy wave that crushed me, that made me wonder if I would ever surface. ... And when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person. Changed. Forever changed,\u201d Davis wrote. \n \n The 304-page hardcover is priced at $27.97 from Blue Rider Press, and imprint of the Penguin Group. \n \n The book's title comes from a Lady Bird Johnson quote: \u201cBecome so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid.\u201d \n \n Abortion rights have been a major undercurrent in the race for governor between the Fort Worth Democrat and Abbott, a staunch abortion opponent. He has indicated he opposes the procedure even for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, saying, \u201cWe shouldn't discriminate against a child.\u201d \n \n The Abbott campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \n \n Her memoir is being published as she trails in the polls behind Abbott, who is favored at a time when Democrats haven't elected anyone to statewide office in two decades. \n \n Rice University political scientist Mark Jones said he doesn't expect the revelation to lose any votes for Davis, since he said it's a relative small proportion of voters who oppose abortion in cases of severe fetal abnormality. \n \n \u201cThe group that will be most bothered by her having an abortion of a baby with a severe fetal abnormality is a group that wasn't going to vote for her anyway,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cThe positive side of it for her is it humanizes her, and also makes it a little tricky for opponents to attack her on the abortion issue because now, it not only is a political issue for her, but it's a personal issue,\u201d Jones said. \n \n Davis launched her campaign last year after rising to national prominence with her fight against tighter abortion restrictions through a filibuster in which she shared women's personal stories. \n \n Her pregnancy with Tate hasn't come up in the race, although she wrote that she considered talking about it during the filibuster when she read the story of a woman that was wrenchingly close to her own. \n \n That woman said the legislation's ban on abortion at 20 weeks would have prevented her choice on how best to proceed when her unborn baby was diagnosed with a terminal condition. Davis said she almost shared her story of Tate then, but she felt it would overshadow the day's events. \n \n Davis has previously disclosed the termination of another pregnancy, a medical necessity because the egg was implanted in her fallopian tube. That ectopic pregnancy wasn't sustainable, and her doctor advised her it would be dangerous to her health to continue because it would risk rupturing her tube, she said in her memoir. \n \n Davis wrote that the ending of the ectopic pregnancy \u201cis technically considered an abortion,\u201d and that that she also was \u201cheartbroken\u201d over that loss. She said she believed that she was carrying a boy, whom she and Jeff already referred to as \u201cBaby Lucas.\u201d \n \n In her campaign, Davis has largely couched the abortion issue in terms of women's access to health care. \n \n The story of her pregnancy with Tate, however, is a key part of her memoir. The book's dedication begins, \u201cFor my daughters, Amber and Dru and Tate, who taught me a love deeper than I believed was possible.\u201d \n \n Amber is her daughter from her first marriage and Dru, from her second, to Jeff Davis, a former City Council member. \n \n The book also is dedicated to Davis' parents, whose tumultuous relationship is detailed in the book, along with that volatility's tough impact on their children. \n \n Davis previously has talked about the financial strain when her father left the family and pursued his dream of a career in theater, but the book includes sometimes stark detail about those times and other parts of her life. \n \n At one point, Davis said, her mother put her three young children in the trunk of her car in the garage, intending to get in the car herself and start the engine. She told Davis years later that she didn't want to live without her husband and didn't want to leave her children behind. \n \n A neighbor dropped by and ended up praying with her, getting her past the dark spot. \n \n \u201cI've long believed in angels on earth, in a higher power, in moments when someone or something comes into your life out of the blue and saves you from the dangerous path you're on. Like that one,\u201d Davis said. \n \n Davis more than once cites \u201cangels\u201d and talks about her faith in God in the memoir as she outlines her life story, which has come under a microscope because of its importance to her narrative in the governor's race. \n \n The memoir adds layers of detail to her story of a hardscrabble life after her father left their family; her struggles to pay the bills as a young mother after her first marriage ended; and community college as the first step on an upward path including graduation from Harvard Law School and service on the Fort Worth City Council and in the state Senate. \n \n Davis previously has faced questions for suggesting she was a teen-age single mom (her first divorce wasn't final until she was 21, although she separated earlier) and for her lack of emphasis on her second husband's role in her journey. \n \n She has long cited the essential truth of her story, and the memoir includes specifics. She credits Jeff as her partner and mentor, while maintaining she would have gone through law school even without him. \n \n Davis also writes extensively about her relationship with her first husband and her family, including her sympathy for her mother, the stalwart caregiver, and her father, who left the family in tough financial straits when they divorced and he pursed his dream of community theater \u2014 but whom she describes as \u201cmagic,\u201d the parent who let her know she was loved. He died last year, before she announced for governor. \n \n Davis ends the book with a story of a time she felt Tate said good-bye to her, when she and her husband and friends were on a golf course and Davis was caught in a cylindrical swirl of leaves, lifted by the wind. \n \n \u201cAnd I felt her. I was sure of it. Tate. Moving through me, saying her good-byes to me. Letting me go,\u201d Davis wrote. \n \n pfikac@express-news.net ||||| AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, who became a national political sensation by filibustering her state's tough new restrictions on abortion, discloses in her upcoming memoir that she had an abortion in the 1990s after discovering that the fetus had a severe brain abnormality. \n \n FILE - In this Aug. 26, 2014, file photo, Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis presents her new education policy during a stop at Palo Alto College in San Antonio. Davis reveals in a new... (Associated Press) \n \n In \"Forgetting to be Afraid,\" Davis also writes about ending an earlier ectopic pregnancy, in which an embryo implants outside the uterus. Davis says she considered revealing the terminated pregnancies during her nearly 13-hour speech on the floor of the Texas Senate last summer \u2014 but decided against it, saying \"such an unexpected and dramatically personal confession would overshadow the events of the day.\" \n \n The Associated Press purchased an early copy of the book, which goes on sale Tuesday. \n \n Both pregnancies happened before Davis, a state senator from Fort Worth, began her political career and after she was already a mother to two young girls. Davis catapulted to national Democratic stardom after her filibuster temporarily delayed passed of sweeping new abortion restrictions. She's now running for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is heavily favored to replace Republican Gov. Rick Perry next year. \n \n The second pregnancy happened in 1996. Davis writes that during her second trimester she took a blood test that could determine chromosomal or neural defects, which doctors first told her didn't warrant concern. But a later exam revealed that the brain of the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides, Davis says. She sought opinions from multiple doctors, who told her the baby would be deaf, blind and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery, she writes. \n \n \"I could feel her little body tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do,\" Davis writes. \"She was suffering.\" \n \n She goes on to say that an \"indescribable blackness followed\" the pregnancy and that the loss left her forever changed. \n \n The ectopic pregnancy happened in 1994, and terminating it was considered medically necessary, Davis writes. Such pregnancies generally aren't considered viable, meaning the fetus can't survive, and they can endanger the mother's life. But Davis writes that in Texas, it's \"technically considered an abortion, and doctors have to report it as such.\" \n \n Davis' filibuster in June 2013 set off a chaotic scene in the Texas Capitol that extended past midnight. Thousands of people watched it online, with President Barack Obama at one point tweeting, \"Something special is happening in Austin tonight.\" \n \n In the book, Davis recalls reading testimony during the filibuster about a woman who had had an abortion after learning her daughter would be born with a terminal illness. She says the story could have been hers and writes about her hands shaking and wiping tears from her eyes. \n \n Davis' filibuster only temporarily delayed the restrictions, which passed overwhelmingly when Perry called a special legislative session. The measure requires doctors who perform abortion to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and mandates that clinics upgrade its facilities to hospital-level operating standards. A federal judge in Austin last month blocked a portion of the law that would have left Texas with only seven abortion facilities statewide. \n \n Anti-abortion groups, including those that have attacked Davis' candidacy, expressed sympathy for the tough choice Davis confronted with the second terminated pregnancy but said they hoped all decisions end in choosing to continue a pregnancy. \n \n \"That's an incredibly difficult position for anyone to find themselves in. While our heart goes out for the decision she had to make, again, still the value of life is precious,\" Texans Right to Life spokeswoman Melissa Conway said Friday night. \n \n Abbott spokesman Matt Hirsch did not return messages seeking comment. \n \n Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood and the daughter of former Texas Gov.

That's because Davis is revealing for the first time that Tate is the unborn child that she and her husband aborted in the second trimester, after doctors discovered a severe brain abnormality. The San Antonio Express-News and the AP obtained advanced copies, and the news is generating headlines given that Davis shot to national fame while filibustering against an abortion bill in Texas. Davis writes that she decided to abort in 1996 after doctors said the baby would be blind, deaf, and in a vegetative state if she survived the pregnancy. Davis also felt the fetus \u201ctremble violently\" in the womb, \"as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do. She was suffering.\" Her doctor \"quieted\" the unborn child's heart and delivered her by C-section. Davis and her husband had Tate baptized. After the abortion, \"an indescribable blackness followed,\" writes Davis in Forgetting to Be Afraid, \"and when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person.\" Davis also writes of a previously disclosed procedure to terminate an earlier ectopic pregnancy in which the embryo was implanted outside the uterus. She says she opted not to talk about either case during her famous filibuster because she feared it would \"overshadow the events of the day.\"",

Davis writes that she felt Tate \"tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her in the womb.\" She was delivered by cesarean section and died a day later. \"An blackness followed. It was a deep, dark despair and grief, a heavy wave that crushed me,\" Davis writes. \"And when I finally did come through it, I emerged a different person. Changed. Forever changed.\" Davis hasn't discussed the abortion before in her campaign, but the book's title comes from a Lady Bird Johnson quote: \"Become so wrapped up in something that you forget to be afraid.\" Political scientist Mark Jones tells the Express-News that he doesn't expect the book to hurt Davis in the governor's race: \"The group that will be most bothered by her having an abortion of a baby with a severe fetal abnormality is a group that wasn't going to vote for her anyway.\"",

The figures are Weinstock\u2019s playful way of boosting the visibility of scientists, in particular the work of female scientists. \n \n Now, a set of LEGOs Weinstock created celebrating the history of women at NASA is about to blast off. On Tuesday, LEGO announced that Weinstock\u2019s project, which spotlights five women who made historic contributions to the U.S. space program, has been selected to become an official LEGO set. \n \n \u201cWhat a wonderful way to celebrate the scientific achievements of these five pioneering women,\ufffd? says Zuber, the E.A. Griswold Professor of Geophysics and the first woman to lead a NASA planetary mission. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thrilled with the message that these LEGOs will send to girls \u2014 that they, too, can pursue their passions in science, technology, engineering, and math, and help make a better world.\ufffd? \n \n Last summer Weinstock submitted her concept, dubbed the Women of NASA, to LEGO Ideas, a platform that allows people around the world to propose new ideas for LEGO concepts. After a public voting period, during which Weinstock\u2019s set received 10,000 votes in 15 days, her project underwent an official LEGO review. \n \n Weinstock was inspired to create the set by her love of space and NASA, and her desire to showcase the contributions that women have made over the years to the field of space exploration. Above all, she hopes the set will help encourage more young girls to pursue STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math). \n \n \u201cI hope that \u2018Women of NASA\u2019 will be one little extra brick in the wall of trying to improve how women are perceived and shown in books, toys, and family programming,\ufffd? Weinstock explains. \u201cAnything I can do to help make sure girls understand that they can and should be interested in the sciences, engineering, and math, that is my goal. At the end of the day, that\u2019s why I am doing this.\ufffd? \n \n The set depicts five trailblazers in NASA\u2019s history: Margaret Hamilton, a computer scientist who led the development of software for the Apollo missions while at MIT; Mae Jemison, who became the first African-American woman in space in 1992; Katherine Johnson, known for calculating and verifying trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo programs; Sally Ride, who became the first American woman in space in 1983; and astronomer Nancy Grace Roman, one of the first female executives at NASA, who was instrumental in the planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. \n \n Weinstock explains that she wanted the set to feature \u201ca very diverse group of women in terms of what they did, in terms of their fields at NASA, in terms of their cultural backgrounds, and also in terms of their age. Some are shown as younger, but I made sure I had one shown as older. Also, most of the women in the set are known for their work in the space flight program at NASA, but I wanted to give a shout out to the astronomy program as well.\ufffd? \n \n Weinstock began creating LEGO figures back in 2009, when she constructed a LEGO likeness for her friend Carolyn Porco, a planetary scientist known for her imaging work on the Voyager and Cassini missions. After sharing an image of Porco\u2019s LEGO figurine on Twitter, Weinstock received an outpouring of positive feedback and was inspired to create more figures in an effort to help promote the work of living scientists. \n \n Since she built her first figurine, Weinstock has created LEGOs for a number of celebrated scientists and engineers, including primatologist Jane Goodall, oceanographer Sylvia Earle, physicist Stephen Hawking, and a number of MIT faculty members such as Ernest Moniz, professor of physics and special advisor to the president, and Sangeeta Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a member of MIT\u2019s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. \n \n \u201cBeing immortalized in LEGO is probably the coolest thing that has ever happened to me,\ufffd? Bhatia says. \u201cI hope it makes lots of little tinkerers dream about being engineers at MIT someday.\ufffd? \n \n Weinstock explains that she chose LEGOs as her medium as she feels \u201cthere is a childlike wonder to playing with a toy that you can make in people\u2019s likeness.\ufffd? \n \n \u201cOne major goal for me is to get the public to recognize the history of women in the STEM fields.

While the MDHHS cannot conclude that the increase is related to the water emergency in Flint, the State of Michigan is treating this situation with the same urgency and transparency as the lead response in the city of Flint. \n \n MDHHS has confirmed data through March 2015, and is finalizing preliminary data through November 2015, which indicates an additional increase in cases. From June 2014 to March 2015, 45 LD cases were confirmed in Genesee County, including seven associated fatalities. From May 2015 through November 2015, 42 LD cases, including one case of Pontiac Fever, were reported in Genesee County. There were three associated fatalities. The age range of these individuals was 26\u201394, with illness onset dates from June 6, 2014 to March 9, 2015 and May 4, 2015 to October 29, 2015. \n \n Legionella is a type of bacteria commonly found in the environment that grows best in warm water, such as hot tubs, cooling towers, hot water tanks, potable water systems, and decorative fountains. When people are exposed to the bacteria, it can cause Legionellosis, a respiratory disease that can infect the lungs and cause pneumonia. The bacteria can also cause a less serious infection called Pontiac fever. Legionella cannot spread from one person to another person. \n \n \u201cWhile Legionellosis cases are not uncommon, we are concerned about the increase in cases seen in Genesee County,\u201d said Eden Wells, M.D., chief medical executive with the MDHHS. \u201cWe are releasing this report and continuing surveillance and investigations to ensure that appropriate actions are being taken to protect the health of the residents of Flint.\u201d \n \n During LD outbreak investigations, clinical specimens are often evaluated against environmental specimens to aid in determining an infection source. One reason that the increase in cases cannot be directly related to the change in Flint water supply is due to the lack of clinical Legionella isolates from case patients. Clinical isolates are necessary to interpret the findings of an environmental investigation in an outbreak. \n \n In the fall of 2014, MDHHS noticed an increase in people with LD and offered assistance to Genesee County Health Department (GCHD) with case investigations to determine exposures. In January of 2015, MDHHS stepped in to coordinate GCHD\u2019s response. By April 2015, MDHHS had developed an interview questionnaire and began conducting case investigations to look at travel, work, and locations visited during the two weeks prior to symptom onset. These two weeks are considered the incubation period for LD. \n \n Of the confirmed first 45 cases, the source of water at the primary residence was City of Flint water for 47 percent of cases. When looking at additional community sources, more than half of the individuals had a healthcare facility exposure in the two weeks prior to their illness onset and the facility has since implemented multiple environmental and procedural measures to alleviate the situation. Preliminary data from May through November 2015 regarding case investigation information is being finalized and will be released soon. \n \n Ten people had no exposure to a Flint hospital in the two weeks prior to illness nor were their homes on the Flint water system. Other possible exposures were evaluated and no other known community exposures were identified. Enhanced surveillance has continued for the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. \n \n MDHHS has been and continues to work with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on this matter. MDHHS shared an initial report with federal partners in June 2015, and initiated and has continued to facilitate regular communication with our federal partners and GCHD to monitor cases. \n \n Vigilant legionellosis awareness and surveillance is occurring in Genesee County. MDHHS informed hospitals in Genesee County of the increase of cases in January 2015, as well as recommended actions on their part throughout all of 2015. MDHHS has also recommended that the GCHD work with the clinical community in Genesee County to assist in LD surveillance through accurate identification, testing, and reporting of all suspect cases. \n \n Most people exposed to Legionella do not become ill. People at higher risk of getting sick include: individuals over 50 years old; current or former smokers; those with chronic lung disease; people with a weakened immune system from diseases like cancer, diabetes, or kidney failure; and individuals who take medications that weaken the immune system, such as steroids or chemotherapy. \n \n MDHHS is releasing the summary report which was shared in December 2015. \n \n \n \n For information about the Flint water emergency, visit www.michigan.gov/flintwater. \n \n # # # ||||| (CNN) Residents of Flint, Michigan, already reeling because of lead contamination in their drinking water, got more disturbing news on Wednesday. \n \n Gov. Rick Snyder announced the number of cases of Legionnaires' disease has spiked in Genesee County in the two years since Flint switched its water supply from the Great Lakes to the Flint River. \n \n But the increase cannot be directly attributed to the switch, said Nick Lyon, director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Not all the people who got Legionnaires' were exposed to Flint water, he said. \n \n From June 2014 to November 2015, at least 87 county residents developed Legionnaires' disease, compared to between six and 13 cases in the four preceding years, Lyon said. Ten patients died, he said. \n \n The water looked smelled and tasted funny \n \n Health officials are not changing recommendations about how Flint residents should deal with the water crisis. They should keep drinking bottled water and use water filters, Snyder said. \n \n Legionnaires' disease is a respiratory bacterial infection usually spread through mist that comes from a water source. It is not transmitted person to person. Symptoms of the disease include fever, chills and a cough. The CDC estimates 8,000 to 18,000 people are hospitalized with Legionnaire's disease in the United States every year. \n \n Flint, an economically depressed city of about 100,000 people, started getting its water from the Flint River about two years. It previously bought Lake Huron water through the city of Detroit. The state government made that change to cut costs. \n \n Soon after the switch, the water started to look, smell and taste funny. People complained. \n \n On January 5, Snyder declared a state of emergency for Genesee County as a result of the water crisis. \n \n He apologized for the state's actions, but residents and officials are furious. The state denied the problem existed for months and failed to use anti-corrosive treatment on the river water, which might have reduced the iron. \n \n 'Flint residents are victims in this crisis' \n \n \"Flint needs more action and less talk from Governor Snyder,\" U.S. Rep. Dan Kildee said in a press release. \"It is important to remember that this crisis was created by a state-appointed emergency financial manager, and it is the state's ultimate responsibility to act and make it right. Flint residents are the victims in this crisis, and they deserve a more urgent response equal to the gravity of this crisis.\" \n \n Flint switched back to Detroit water in October. \n \n \"It will require more time and effort before the water is safe to drink again,\" the city of Flint website said . \"Until that time, residents and water customers are urged to continue using water filters and bottled water.\" \n \n Dr. Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech researcher who studied Flint water and found high levels of lead, said it would be almost impossible to make a definitive link between the water source and Legionnaires' disease. To do so, he said, would require matching the strain of Legionnaires' in someone's body to the strain in the water. \n \n \"What's clear is that there's an association, which means that the increase of the Legionnaires increased pretty dramatically,\" he said. \"And there's a strong likelihood that it's related to the water supply. \n \n \"We'll never know for sure, but we did find very high levels in the time period when they were on the Flint River water.\" \n \n Edwards said this might be the first case of Legionnaires' associated to lack of corrosion control. \n \n \"This is already a tragedy,\" he said. \"It's a crisis of conscience in government. This could potentially just add to it. But they're being very forthcoming about it at this point. There are just so many places where you wish people had done things differently.\" \n \n National Guard activated \n \n Snyder activated the state National Guard on Wednesday to assist with the water crisis. \n \n Seven guardsmen arrived in the town Wednesday, and up to 30 are expected by Friday, Snyder said in a news release. \n \n They will help distribute bottled water and water filters at fire stations and other public buildings, he said. That will allow Red Cross volunteers to go door-to-door to hand out water, filters and testing kits. \n \n FEMA announced that it approved Snyder's request for federal assistance, according to agency spokesman Rafael Lemaitre. The governor had asked FEMA to step in to coordinate with other federal agencies. ||||| An investigative science reporting series by Flintwaterstudy.org \n \n The Flint Water Crisis (FWC) and its aftermath as revealed in the ongoing legal cases (Wells, Lyon, Edwards vs Wayne State, Edwards versus Schwartz et al.) and this FlintWaterStudy blog series is destined to become a historic and instructive engineering ethics case study. We continue to document our efforts to navigate ethical dilemmas and hold \u201cpublic safety paramount\u201d as embodied in ethical codes of conduct such as that of the American Society of Civil Engineers. \n \n After FlintWaterStudy first made the startling claim that a few engineers had primary responsibility for the Flint Water Crisis, our position was affirmed December 2015, and finally reached closure when two of the engineers pled guilty December 26, 2018. In 2015, Governor Snyder apologized for their mistakes and took actions promoting reform at MDEQ (and EPA). His appointment of independent and knowledgeable truth-speakers to the Flint Water Advisory Task Force in 2015 was critical \u2014 this Task Force\u2019s reports withstood the test of time and their recommendations effectively guided the disaster response. Snyder also invited critics Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha and Dr. Edwards to work on the recovery alongside the agencies they were previously fighting against, worked to close loopholes with Michigan\u2019s tough new Lead and Copper Rule, and funded FACHEP to investigate the Legionnaires\u2019 Disease outbreak. \n \n And while it is true that every level of government had some responsibility for creating the FWC, it should also be noted that every level of government came together in an unprecedented and exemplary fashion after January 2016 to help fix the Flint water system. After President Obama declared a Federal Emergency, Dr. Edwards participated in over a dozen FWC data summits and hundreds of interagency teleconference calls focused on controlling lead and Legionella. The National Guard, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ), Genesee County Health Department (GCHD), City of Flint (COF), United Way and others played exemplary roles. Whistleblower Miguel Del Toral was released from effective house arrest and became the public face of the Environmental Protection Agency emergency response, while hundreds of EPA and MDEQ employees worked tirelessly for Flint. \n \n By mid-2016 it was obvious that these extraordinary efforts, along with the switch back to treated Lake Huron water purchased from DWSD/GLWA on October 16, 2015, had produced major improvements in water quality. Chlorine disinfectant levels rose after switching back to Detroit water, EPA implemented enhanced corrosion control and boosted chlorine, and financial credits supported a \u201cFlush for Flint program.\u201d The 90th percentile lead level was dropping below the EPA action level and every reasonable recommendation made to control Legionella was implemented. While the system had not yet fully restabilized, the trends were promising and the Flint Federal Emergency designation officially ended August 14, 2016. \n \n FACHEP\u2019s Toxic Mindset \n \n FACHEP was funded in February 2016 under emergency procedures and their Phase 1 study results were published in late June 2016. Their Phase 2 work had a primary goal to \u201cReduce the occurrence of Legionellosis-associated cases, hospitalizations and deaths to levels at or below those seen in years prior to 2014.\u201d It took a few months to negotiate and fund the substantial $3.4 million FACHEP Phase 2 budget and vet a correspondingly expansive scope of work, and the work was slow because Professor Shawn McElmurry was inexperienced with human subjects research\u2013he literally had to complete the most basic training before he could even conduct the work. \n \n The behavior of FACHEP collaborators and emails between May and August 2016 reveal an increasingly toxic and unscientific mindset, suggesting a growing sense of frustration that Flint\u2019s rapidly improving water quality would leave them with no urgent problems to solve. In this series we argue that those who took the public mantle of FACHEP leadership considered themselves to be the sole entity worthy of the residents\u2019 trust and who had the expertise to solve the FWC. This mindset may have arisen from McElmurry\u2019s touching story of FACHEP\u2019s \u201cdivine conception\u201d due to his myth of work in Flint from 2010-2015 and Wayne State\u2019s public proclamation of \u201cunique expertise.\u201d \n \n Consider testimony from Drs. McElmurry, Kilgore, and Zervos (WSU) about a May 2016 meeting discussing the FACHEP Phase 2 work plan with Mr. Lyon. During that meeting, they argued that if FACHEP\u2019s requested $11-13 million in funding was not immediately granted, \u201cpeople will die\u201d due to delays in engaging their expertise. A witness attending this meeting with FACHEP faculty stated: \n \n Dr. Kilgore turned red and pounded his hand on the table and said, \u201cPeople are going to Fucking die\u201d if the research was not able to proceed immediately and as planned. \n \n To their chagrin, all the data that came in during summer 2016 proved that those diligently working on the water emergency since October 2015 were not the uncaring incompetents from which FACHEP imagined they would save Flint residents. Moreover, FACHEP Phase 1 documented increasing chlorine levels and no detectable Legionella in samples collected from homes during January 2016. The incidence of Legionnaires Disease had plunged dramatically through September 2016, compared to the 2014-2015 outbreaks, without any help from FACHEP whatsoever. \n \n A set of revelatory emails was exchanged just two days before the Federal Emergency ended, after an upbeat Flint Water Interagency Coordinating Committee meeting and as McElmurry was finally completing his last required human subjects paperwork. After arguing that certain disagreements with the team\u2019s ideas (to be discussed in future blogs) were due to \u201cpurely political\u201d reasoning, McElmurry noted: \n \n We really are running out of time. With summer nearly complete\u2026.I can\u2019t tell you how furious I am with the state, they have completely screwed us and the people of Flint\u2026 \n \n This statement echoed the prior false claim that \u201cpeople will die\u201d unless FACHEP funding was immediately granted. McElmurry expressed further angst that \u201cMarc Edwards also gave (sic) presentation saying legionella detected in residential households was low,\u201d raising fears that a primary FACHEP goal had already been achieved before their work even began, and there were concerns that the State was \u201cpulling out of Flint.\u201d \n \n The email discussion concluded with Dr. Zervos appropriately suggesting that FACHEP should consider \u201cworking totally independently from the <GCHD and MDHHS> health departments,\u201d a point that McElmurry immediately agreed with: \n \n I am fine with working outside of health department (sic), their conflict of interest is even worse than the State\u2026it will just be extremely difficult for some aspects of the project. \n \n At this point, we raise a critical ethical question. If the circumstances were truly as noxious as expressed, was it ethical for FACHEP faculty to accept research funding from MDHSS in the first place? For example, codes of ethics state that engineers \u201cshall act for each employer as faithful agents or trustees,\u201d \u201cshall advise their clients or employers when they believe a project will not be successful,\u201d and \u201cshall disclose all known or potential conflicts of interest that could influence or appear to influence their judgment or the quality of their services.\u201d It strikes us as fundamentally unethical and unfair to all parties, to accept research funding from a client who you believe has just \u201ccompletely screwed us,\u201d particularly for a project that you felt would not be successful. And how it is possible that the personal conflicts would not affect FACHEP\u2019s judgment or quality of services? Unfortunately, rather than seeking out other sponsors as was discussed, or even going to the media with their complaints which was also mentioned, they decided to take the funding. \n \n Not surprisingly given FACHEP\u2019s toxic attitude, three exemplars of unethical tactics and incompetence, were to reach a crescendo almost immediately after their Phase 2 launch including: 1) Low chlorine alerts, 2) Claims to have discovered \u201cdangerous\u201d bacteria on Flint\u2019s point of use filters, and 3) Implying Flint water was causing a Shigella outbreak. We will first review the \u201clow chlorine\u201d issue, because it illustrates the maddening position of Dr. Eden Wells and how the only FACHEP team member with significant drinking water experience (Dr. Susan Masten, Michigan State University) eventually became alienated from the rest of the team. \n \n Meet the whistleblower from Michigan State University \n \n We have come to know Dr. Masten as a quiet, knowledgeable, humble, and highly ethical professor, characteristics destined to clash with some other collaborators selected by McElmurry. Dr. Masten has remarkable moral humility and a healthy respect for the second canon of Civil Engineering ethics, which, to the present day, compels her to be the first to acknowledge the limitations of her own expertise and her own shortcomings. She considers her core expertise to be drinking water treatment with some experience in monitoring municipal water distribution systems. The topics of building plumbing, Legionella and chlorine regulation are not within her expertise. Dr. Masten was also McElmurry\u2019s teacher when he attended MSU, and she once considered him a friend and colleague. These factors make the events described herein all the more painful, yet laudatory. \n \n In the interest of full disclosure, through February 2018, Dr. Edwards and Dr. Masten respected but did not really like each other. It was only after Dr. Faust informed Dr. Edwards that McElmurry had gone out of his way to malign Edwards with her, that he recalled some ill feelings about Dr. Masten had similarly originated from McElmurry. Edwards decided to reach out to Dr. Masten to better understand what happened and apologize for hard feelings based on hearsay, when he learned Dr. Masten had anger about Dr. Edwards that also originated from McElmurry. Both Masten and Edwards then went to Dr. Faust, who confirmed McElmurry had also bad mouthed Masten. Confused? Well, to put it simply, three people who once disliked each other for no good reason, were now fast friends, and a pathological rumor-mongerer had been exposed. As we dug deeper, we found that strategically maligning others was a habit of McElmurry and other FACHEP leaders. In this case, the false statements effectively prevented Drs. Faust, Edwards, and Masten from exchanging revelatory information, whereas in other cases, these tactics morphed into something even more twisted. \n \n Before we finally dive into this story, we must once again remind readers about the difficult tightrope water utilities walk in terms of controlling the levels of chlorine in distributed drinking water. Specifically, if chlorine levels in distributed water are too low, there is concern that the incidence of some waterborne diseases might increase. Conversely, if chlorine levels are too high, consumers may get itchy skin, complain of \u201cswimming pool\u201d smells and tastes in water, and the levels of trihalomethanes (THMs) can exceed regulatory limits. Based on her extensive experience and analysis, Dr. Masten co-authored an excellent paper highlighting all these problems and trade-offs for Flint in late 2016 from a perspective of water treatment. \n \n How much chlorine is \u201ctoo low\u201d or \u201ctoo high\u201d in a given Michigan home? In terms of the minimum, Michigan law states that: \n \n The residual disinfectant concentration in the distribution system, measured as total chlorine\u2026shall not be undetectable in more than 5% of the samples each month for any 2 consecutive months that the supply serves water to the public. \n \n In other words, 95% of samples collected at defined monitoring points of the distribution system, must have detectable (\u2265 0.1 mg/L according to MDEQ) levels of chlorine. The maximum chlorine is set by the U.S. EPA Maximum Residual Disinfectant Level (MRDL) of 4 mg Cl 2 /L. Hence, according to the chlorine balancing act as defined by Michigan law, a chlorine level of 0 to 4 mg/L is perfectly acceptable at a given home. The American Water Works Association (AWWA) has the same recommendation, but with a recommended minimum of 0.2 mg/L (instead of 0.1 mg/L) for 95% of sampling sites. It is also worth noting that millions of Michigan residents use ground water with no chlorine residual at all (including MSU) as is common all over the U.S. \n \n FACHEP\u2019s First Press Release: Lower Chlorine Than Recommended \n \n The \u201clow chlorine\u201d fiasco started when FACHEP prepared their first press release October 16, 2016, just after McElmurry returned from three weeks in Australia. McElmurry claimed he completed a \u201cliterature review\u201d on chlorine recommendations, and inserted the following concerning statement into the press release about levels of chlorine in Flint homes. \n \n So far we\u2019ve also found chlorine levels in about 20 percent of the homes to be less than current recommendations. The American Water Works Association recommends maintaining a residual chlorine level between 0.2 mg/L and 2.0 mg/L at all times. We\u2019ve identified some homes that are below 0.2 mg/L. \n \n Upon review of the draft release, Dr. Wells immediately noticed a key concern, stating \u201cwe advise you repeatedly that controls were needed\u2014this appears again to be results without context.\u201d This meant FACHEP should show data from other cities (i.e., controls), to make sure they would never make it falsely appear to Flint residents that they were in some kind of unique danger when that was not the case. FACHEP had already collected data showing many homes outside of Flint had non-detectable levels of chlorine as allowed under Michigan law, but McElmurry ignored Dr. Wells and did not put that information in the press release. Dr. Edwards also reviewed a copy of the press release and explicitly noted the statement on the AWWA chlorine recommendation was highly misleading. He subsequently sent Wells a direct web link to a 2015 AWWA reference about chlorine levels. For whatever reason, Edwards\u2019 input was also not reflected in the final press release. \n \n After the statement was published, Flint consumers received sampling results with worrisome statements that chlorine should always be 0.2 \u2013 2.0 mg/L to protect them from Legionnaires disease. FlintWaterStudy then received phone calls from Flint residents who were very concerned that their chlorine was \u201ctoo low\u201d (i.e., 0-0.2 mg Cl 2 /L) or \u201ctoo high,\u201d (i.e., 2.1-4.0 mg Cl 2 /L), even though Michigan law allows chlorine to be anywhere between 0 \u2013 4 mg/L. Lawyers at the state immediately jumped at the claim 20 percent of Flint homes were failing to meet AWWA recommendations, and Dr. Wells urgent efforts to get information from McElmurry on what to do about this problem were unsuccessful. Wayne State\u2019s risk communication \u201cexpert\u201d Dr. Matt Seeger was the first to respond to Wells urgent request: \n \n As I indicated earlier, FACHEP is making no public health recommendations. We are not a health department and whatever we say would be inappropriate. We are trying very hard to stay in our lane. We referenced existing documents in the release \n \n By \u201cexisting documents,\u201d Seeger was apparently referencing McElmurry\u2019s use of a citation from a 1990 AWWA book that was written before distribution monitoring of TTHMs were required. (i.e., Pontius, AWWA, 1990, p 1194). It took us a few weeks to obtain this hopelessly outdated reference, and it turns out there is no such recommendation on page 1194, nor could we find it anywhere else in the book. In fact, there were many statements about residual chlorine in the book contradicting McElmurry\u2019s quote. \n \n Considering that there were two other FACHEP train wrecks in progress at the exact time (to be described in future blogs), Dr. Wells was being too kind when she wrote back the evening of October 19, 2016: \n \n Your group today seems to want to throw out some vague information about finding some cases, without controls, with no context and THEN throw your hands up and say \u201coh we have nothing to do about it, that is a public health issue\u201d. Your statements stating that you have no role exemplifies your lack of knowledge or sensitivity to public health issues when producing early unconfirmed and uncontrolled results from your studies\u2026 (such as what you are telling residents about their chlorine levels) that THEN has to be dealt with by the local and state health department, if not also the DEQ, the City, federal CDC and EPA, \u2026. The questions we are getting from our attorneys were for whether the any of these issues indicated a boil water alert!\u2026These experiences \u2026have taken up an INORDINATE amount of time from local state and federal agencies who are already stressed to the maximum to try to deal with responses for important day-to-day issues in our state. We are funding you to be responsible research partners for a PUBLIC HEALTH issue. While you are independent, you do not operate in isolation, and you are responsible for the impact that your statements may cause in the population that you deliver them to. \n \n On the morning of October 20 2016, McElmurry finally emailed a response to Wells, repeating his quote that supposedly came from the 1990 AWWA book, which he was interpreting to mean that every resident with chlorine less than 0.2 mg/L in their water was in danger. He then asked Wells to figure out what to do about this \u201cproblem,\u201d and suggested that Wells should consider issuing a warning to residents with less than 0.2 mg/L chlorine and point of use filters to \u201cboil water\u201d before consumption. \n \n McElmurry drags others into the debacle \n \n At that point, Dr. Wells directed McElmurry to the chlorine subject matter experts (SME) at EPA, Dr. Jonathan Pressman and Mr. Mark Durno, who had been intensively working on improving the chlorine situation in Flint for almost a year. Over the next week they also grew frustrated with McElmurry, who admitted he had errors in residential addresses, some of the low chlorine results were from homes with whole house filters designed to remove chlorine, and he therefore could not help EPA help the State solve the problem he supposedly had uncovered. While they waited for McElmurry to get the addresses, on October 24th, Dr. Pressman point blank asked McElmurry the same question Dr. Edwards had in mind when he first read the press release: \n \n I\u2019m curious to know the reference of the quote\u2026from your press release\u2026The sources of chlorine residual advice that I am most immediately familiar with, such as the AWWA partnership for safe water, use a 95% of the time statement, not \u201cat all times.\u201d \n \n Incredibly, although McElmurry must have known that he personally inserted that erroneous phrase into the press release just a week earlier, he emailed Dr. Masten: \n \n I feel like he is splitting hairs here but I\u2019ll have to respond. I can\u2019t remember how this sentence made it in\u2026.if we had a real quote to reference or not. Do you? \n \n What? McElmurry had needlessly created a false alarm amongst Flint residents and disrupted multiple agencies working to protect public health, and he now wanted Dr. Masten to bail him out and find a real quote to support his mistake? Over the next few days, Dr. Masten looked hard to find something, but in the end she could did not find a \u201creal quote to reference.\u201d As was typical whenever McElmurry was confronted with an important question that demanded a response, and providing an honest answer would expose his mistakes and ignorance, he simply never responded to Pressman at all. McElmurry also refused to answer Dr. Edwards when asked the same direct question months later. \n \n When McElmurry finally got around to providing EPA the addresses, the expert chlorine response team with representatives from Flint, MDEQ, and EPA was dispatched to investigate. On October 31st, 2016, they reported back that hydrant sampling near the \u201clow chlorine\u201d sites reported by FACHEP had good chlorine at > 0.61 mg/L. Dr. Pressman then requested that if McElmurry was going to keep telling residents that they had \u201clow chlorine,\u201d he should immediately inform the city of Flint so they could respond. \n \n By this point McElmurry knew, or should have known, that his scientific basis for providing \u201clow chlorine\u201d alerts to residents and the agencies were bogus. So why on earth did he keep issuing them? The emails suggest he even derived satisfaction from continuing to raise alarms with the agencies for no good reason. For instance, after sending an email alerting EPA and the city to \u201clow chlorine\u201d in a Flint home November 29, 2016, he proudly forwarded it to Dr. Seeger with a statement: \u201cThey are going to love me.\u201d Dr. Seeger responded \u201cWow.\u201d \n \n And as McElmurry continued to sample for chlorine around the State of Michigan, getting the control data that Wells had repeatedly requested, he not surprisingly found many other homes meeting the Michigan standard but violating the McElmurry standard. He was issuing low chlorine letters and email alerts to residents and government officials in Ecorse and River Rouge, MI through late November 2017. \n \n FACHEP makes a mockery of ethical codes \n \n It was around November 2017 when Dr. Masten\u2019s growing concern over what she considered unethical behavior by FACHEP\u2019s leaders, reached a breaking point. FACHEP was trying to rush out a Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) publication concluding that the 2014-2015 Legionella deaths in Flint were due to chlorine levels dropping below 0.2 mg/L in consumer\u2019s homes. In the text of the accepted paper the team had a misleading statement that claimed (bold emphasis added): \n \n To reduce the risk associated with bacterial growth in water distribution systems, regulatory agencies recommend a minimum free chlorine residual of 0.2 to 0.5 mg/L. \u2026chlorine residual is the most widely reported measure of water quality within distribution systems\u2026 \n \n Dr. Masten emailed the lead author Dr. Michelle Swanson to explicitly point out what all of FACHEP should have known: \n \n This is still factually incorrect. Chlorine residual is NOT the most widely measure of water quality. In fact, it is NOT a measure of water quality at all. It is a measure of the amount of disinfectant that remains in water. One can have a low chlorine residual and the water can be of excellent quality. One could have a high chlorine residual and the water could be of poor quality. \n \n After Swanson refused to give Masten time to correct this and other errors in the manuscript, Masten made a very difficult decision to remove her name from the accepted publication. Immediately after this PNAS paper was published, it was used to support FACHEP in their now public disagreement with Mr. Lyon and Dr. Wells, and in court to support criminal charges brought against them. At that point, Dr. Masten decided she was ethically obligated to write the journal editors about her concerns with the document. The erroneous text that Dr. Masten called out was not changed in the final manuscript. In fact, the PNAS paper does not even acknowledge that the present day Michigan law had a standard for detectable chlorine (0.1 mg Cl 2 /L) at 95% of test sites. \n \n Throughout this ordeal, FACHEP\u2019s engineering faculty (other than Masten) repeatedly lectured anyone questioning miscues like their \u201clow chlorine\u201d alert, that the engineering code of ethics mandate to \u201chold public safety paramount\u201d justified their every action. But those same faculty repeatedly violated that same code of ethics, by working outside their core area of expertise, which did not include Legionella, chlorine measurements, Shigella or lead. It seems as if FACHEP leadership had created an alternative universe, in which they were the true heroes of the FWC, fighting against villains, real or imagined, such as Dr. Wells, Mr. Lyon or even Dr. Masten. This mindset is revealed in several illustrative statements, some of which are delusional considering that their real work started AFTER the Federal Emergency and Legionella outbreak had ended. \n \n Illustrative and highly dubious claims of FACHEP faculty heroism \n \n Source/ Date Statement Wayne State Press Release on PNAS article 2/6/2018 \u201cThis abandonment of basic human and civil rights by those who once had the public trust led to water quality, safety and access issues that endangered the public health. In the midst of this maelstrom, a group of engineers along with medical, public health and social scientists assembled a research team to pursue answers to problems that others would rather leave unexamined. The authors of these papers from several universities and members of the research team \u2014 which included community members in meaningful roles \u2014 affirmed the higher purpose of science \u2014 to expand knowledge and serve the common good. As this FACHEP team developed, the key underpinning was the attention to clear, honest communication and careful listening to disenfranchised, marginalized Flint residents.\u201d Dr. Sullivan (FACHEP) 10/20/2016 Thanks, all, for the integrity you\u2019ve already demonstrated to Flint. History will show that in the aftermath of tragedy at the hand of opportunists, you were among the first to demonstrate the nobility of great men. Dr. Ben Pauli (FACHEP) 11/24/2016 Of all the people and groups that are doing or have done testing in Flint, I think our team stands out for demonstrating that a commitment to the residents need not preclude a commitment to good science, and vice versa. Dr. McElmurry \n \n 2/7/2018 Responding to a Facebook post that said: Thank Shawn McElmurry for Standing Up for Flint During the Legionella Outbreak\u2026You Rock! * \n \n McElmurry wrote \u201call of this would have been swept under the rug <without FACHEP>\u201d \n \n * There is no evidence that McElmurry and FACHEP did anything of substance during the Flint Legionella outbreak. \n \n If anyone on FACHEP is to be considered ethical and heroic, in our opinion it will be Dr. Masten, who gave up authorship on a PNAS paper and made other sacrifices as a matter of principle. As her reward for doing the right thing, she was subsequently locked out of future FACHEP conference calls and shunned by the other faculty. \n \n \n \n An enlightening conference call and FACHEP crybullying \n \n As noted in our previous blog, the relationship between FACHEP and the State was without normal checks and balances. Specifically, because government failures created the FWC, FACHEP was fully aware that the press would always take the side of presumably noble and independent faculty in any disputes. Based on media coverage since 2016, it is apparent that they were correct in this assumption. In their emails, FACHEP faculty openly discussed that special prosecutors were looking to charge high ranking public officials within MDHHS for the Legionnaires\u2019 Disease outbreak, and there is even some evidence these faculty had been speaking with the prosecutors. FACHEP repeatedly exploited that power imbalance. \n \n In evaluating the evidence against Wells and Lyon related to FACHEP, we must give special weight to situations that do not involve he-said /she-said recollections. The last communication between Dr. Zervos (FACHEP) and Dr. Wells came March 3, 2017, when he wrote an angry email accusing her of being unethical (emphasis added): \n \n Dr Wells, your comments to us at earlier meetings such as, \u201cDo you know who is funding you?\u201d or your more recent mandate to us to put a stop to the retrospective epidemiologic component of the project, can only be interpreted as a threat, and a clear attempt to influence our independent work and scientific integrity. \n \n The \u201cearlier meeting\u201d in question, was a teleconference call on October 21, 2016, where the issue of the \u201clow chlorine\u201d alerts described herein was discussed. To our knowledge, even as of today, Dr. Wells is probably completely unaware that FACHEP\u2019s written statements in the press release were based on McElmurry\u2019s use of a now 28-year old AWWA citation that does not agree with modern AWWA recommendations or Michigan law. And that FlintWaterStudy, or even McElmurry for that matter, cannot even find a reference for the recommendation that caused so much trouble. \n \n At the start of the call, Wells ethically informed everyone it would be recorded and transcribed for all parties. The call starts in typical FACHEP fashion \u2014 Dr. McElmurry announcing that FACHEP can only spare 30 minutes to work through concerns raised by his research sponsor. The MDHSS employees whose life had been upended by multiple FACHEP train wrecks currently in progress, can be heard to say \u201cWhat the hell?\u201d while the phone was muted, in obvious reference to McElmurry\u2019s misplaced priorities. \n \n Listen \n \n Wells started by noting the awkward position that FACHEP had placed the State in with the \u201clow chlorine\u201d press release claims. McElmurry then made a false statement to Wells, based on what was possibly his zero years of experience measuring chlorine in Flint homes (despite claims of 5 years work) that the data: \n \n was far beyond what it normally\u2013what would normally be expected within a water distribution system and that\u2019s why we thought it was important to relay that information to the public and the water utility \n \n Wells reinforced the need for appropriate controls and sharing critical data immediately with their public health partners before going public, which is something McElmurry was not set up to do as mentioned previously. McElmurry then referred to FACHEP\u2019s policy of communicating results to the public before they even have a chance to do quality control or analyze what they mean (i.e., \u201creal time\u201d reporting): \n \n I am concerned about the values, that\u2019s why I reported it as soon as I realized that we had this problem. I\u2019m reporting to real time (??). \n \n As we will repeatedly see in future blogs, what FACHEP\u2019s leaders would most consistently reveal in \u201creal time,\u201d was that they were incompetent and operating outside their expertise. But Wells then informs McElmurry about the ethical obligation to not just report problems, but to also provide vetted information to residents on what to do about them. She then stated \u201capparently you have done this type of research before,\u201d and asked how he had ethically handled it, to which McElmurry stated: \n \n So the answer to that is I have done this kind of thing, we\u2019ve measured chlorine before and we found it low. And I reported that back to the EPA and DEQ. In, you know, about the same time that I\u2019m doing now. You know, I have not had the same level of urgency from the DEQ and the EPA regarding the data I\u2019m showing. \n \n When this all comes out at trial, we certainly hope that evidence is demanded from McElmurry to document exactly when, where, and how he previously reported \u201clow chlorine\u201d data back to EPA and DEQ. Especially when a \u201clow chlorine\u201d measurement at a home does not violate Michigan law and he cannot find the reference in his press release. Call us skeptical, but by this point, his statement to Dr. Wells sounds like other unsupported McElmurry claims about his work in Flint. \n \n The transcript goes on and on in this manner, with Dr. Wells bending over backwards to try to be understanding and work with FACHEP, when she makes the following statement: \n \n And so there\u2019s been some feeling that perhaps while academia is, you know, collecting all this data and may be able to sort of talk about this in the press\u2013and, again, I\u2019m not faulting you on the press release, but the impression was is oh, well, you know, MDHHS will go figure out what to do about this, and I\u2013and so I just want, I plead that, you know, public health, to us in our world reigns supreme, and we will\u2013we will continue to advocate for your role as an independent, as independent as can be, but remember we\u2019re funding you, and our IRB is with you, but we want you to be as independent, we want you to find anything with the system that had anything to do with the Legionella outbreaks would be great, but to please understand our passion and some of our knowledge when it comes to trying to do these studies in the public sector. All right? \n \n Listen \n \n According to Zervos, this mention of funding, \u201ccan only be interpreted as a threat, and a clear attempt to influence our independent work and scientific integrity.\u201d Interestingly, after the transcript of the call was finally admitted at trial, Zervos still insisted \u201cI took it as intimidation.\u201d We take Zervos\u2019 claim as an example of \u201ccrybullying,\u201d a tactic that FACHEP truly excels at and which they deployed repeatedly. We have attached 77 pages of Zervos trial testimony, a highlighted 45 page transcript of the conference call, and the conference call recording itself to provide supporting documentation for readers that allow their own conclusions to be drawn about FACHEP\u2019s credibility when it comes to \u201cthreats\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d from Dr. Wells (and by extension Mr. Lyon). Our own perspective is that she was bravely trying to do her job, as best she could, given the power imbalance in the face of repeated unethical and incompetent behavior by FACHEP. \n \n The DHHS call transcript ends, with the State employee\u2019s, justifiably mocking the warped engineering code of ethics as embraced by FACHEP\u2019s inept leadership as follows: \n \n (Many thank you\u2019s and goodbyes) Phone all hang up MS. HANLEY: Wow, that\u2019s concerning. I mean\u2013- DR. WELLS: He still hasn\u2019t gotten that household data. MS. HANLEY: What the heck? Seriously. Those of us here around the table could be doing what\u2013it doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist. DR. WELLS: No, it doesn\u2019t. MS. HANLEY: Really? Hand entering? DR. WELLS: Yeah. MS. HANLEY: I can\u2019t believe it. And it\u2019s like\u2014I mean, what do you need for it to be a public health emergency? I don\u2019t get it. I mean, we talked about, not just Ebola, but the Zika and whatever else. I mean, there aren\u2019t a lot of people who have it, but there\u2019s the threat that it could spread, right? And so I just don\u2019t understand why it is that they\u2019re slicing hairs like that, and they\u2019re sitting there spending the time to make these determinations. MS. CALLO: Right, when they\u2019re telling us that, oh, it\u2019s my ethics, my engineering code of ethics, remember that?

Edwards ||||| Buy Photo Governor Rick Snyder addresses questions about a spike in a form of pneumonia in Genesee County. (Photo: Daniel Bethencourt Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo \n \n Since Flint switched its water source to the Flint River, officials have seen a spike in the number of cases of a severe form of pneumonia, called Legionnaires' disease \u2014 but officials say they're still looking for the cause. \n \n There have been 87 cases in Genesee County from June 2014 to November 2015 \u2014 and 10 of those cases resulted in death, said Dr. Eden Wells, chief medical executive with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, or MDHHS. \n \n That number is a jump from previous few years, when the county saw between 6 and 13 cases. It\u2019s not clear how many were fatal. \n \n While state officials said they couldn\u2019t make a connection between the water and the spike in disease, a drinking water expert who studied Flint said the rise in cases was \u201cdramatic,\u201d and added there\u2019s a \u201cvery strong likelihood\u201d the river\u2019s water played a role. \n \n \u201cI applaud the state for releasing this (report),\u201d said Marc Edwards, who heads the Virginia Tech Research Team which was a key player in exposing lead contamination in the city's water. \n \n Officials with the MDHHS say they noticed the spike in the fall of 2014. Months later, in April, MDHHS said they began interviewing residents who were affected. \n \n That summer, Edwards and his team noticed that in some large buildings, which can have older plumbing systems, there were high levels of the bacteria that can cause the illness. \n \n \u201cOur hypothesis is that something about the Flint River and lack of corrosion control, plus big buildings, is creating these problems,\u201d Edwards said Wednesday. \n \n Though officials held a news conference Wednesday to alert the public about the spike, they made clear that there were no changes in recommendations for bathing or showering. Edwards also noted that the water is safe for residents to shower in. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s every reason to believe (the spike) is something in the past,\u201d he added. \n \n Legionnaires' disease is a lung infection caused by Legionella, a type of bacteria that grows best in warm water. The bacteria usually enter the body from a person breathing it in, but it can't spread between people. The most vulnerable are those with weakened immune systems. \n \n Gov. Rick Snyder said he learned of the disease cases only \u201ca few days ago,\" and acknowledged during questioning that the increase in Legionnaires' disease \u201cjust adds to the disaster we are already facing.\u201d \n \n Flint\u2019s water became contaminated with lead in 2014, once its supply source was switched from Lake Huron to the Flint River water, which was treated at the city water treatment plant. \n \n The state downplayed and largely ignored the immediate complaints about the smell, color and taste. In October, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality acknowledged it had failed to ensure the necessary safeguards for corrosion. That failure resulted in lead leaching into the water. \n \n Lead causes permanent brain damage in children and is linked to other health and behavior problems. \n \n The crisis became even more apparent this month, when Snyder declared a state of emergency, and Michigan State Police joined others in distributing bottled water and water filters. The state has also urged all Flint parents with children younger than 6 to have their children\u2019s blood tested for exposure to lead. \n \n In response to Snyder\u2019s announcement Wednesday, Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich, D-Flint, demanded that national infectious disease specialists arrive in Flint \u201ctomorrow\u201d and added, \u201cWe need an investigation into the past outbreak so we know what happened, whether there is any ongoing threat, and how to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d \n \n Flint\u2019s water is still unsafe to drink. Officials on Wednesday did not give a firm time estimate as to when the water might be drinkable once again, though Edwards noted that lead levels in a few homes have already gone down dramatically. \n \n At the news conference on Wednesday, Snyder fielded questions about his administration\u2019s handling of the crisis. He said that a good portion of the fault \u201ccould lie\u201d with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, and welcomed the federal investigation already under way. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re taking every action within reason, and going beyond reason to address this,\u201d he said. He also said, \u201cThis is something you wish that never happened, and let\u2019s see that it never happens again in the state of Michigan.\u201d \n \n Contact Daniel Bethencourt: dbethencourt@freepress.com or 313-223-4531. Follow on Twitter at @_dbethencourt. \n \n Fund established for Flint children \n \n A fund has been established to address the short- and long-term needs of Flint children exposed to lead through contaminated drinking water, the Community Foundation of Greater Flint announced Monday. \n \n \u201cOur Flint children deserve every opportunity to be healthy and successful,\" said Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, the Hurley Medical Center pediatrician who helped expose the tragedy. \"The creation of this Fund will further ensure that our children are afforded the resources and interventions to overcome this population-wide exposure to lead.\u201d \n \n Donations can be made online at www.flintkids.com \n \n Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/1UPCf8i",

Rick Snyder announced a new development Wednesday in Flint's water crisis that \"just adds to the disaster we are already facing\": specifically, a marked increase in cases of Legionnaires' disease that could be linked to the area's tainted water, reports the Detroit Free Press. From June 2014 to November 2015, there were 87 cases in Genesee County, 10 of them fatal, per the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. In the previous four years, Legionnaires' cases ran from six per year to 13, CNN notes. And while the MDHHS isn't able to definitively tie the spike to Flint's water, it's taking the news seriously, and a drinking water expert who's been studying Flint's water tells the Free Press there's a \"very strong likelihood\" that it played a role. MDHHS officials first observed the rise in Legionnaires' cases in the fall of 2014, per the Free Press, and researchers found the bacteria to blame was proliferating in larger buildings, many with older plumbing. \"Our hypothesis is that something about the Flint River and lack of corrosion control, plus big buildings, is creating these problems,\" Marc Edwards, head of an independent Virginia team looking into the crisis, tells the Free Press. Speaking Wednesday, Snyder said he learned of the issue just \"a few days ago\" and appeared to place some blame on the state's Department of Environmental Quality, the paper notes. \"We're taking every action within reason, and going beyond reason to address this,\" he said. State health officials say it's OK for residents to shower and bathe, though they still can't drink the water. Edwards' team agrees, though he laments how it's all been handled. \"It's a crisis of conscience in government,\" he tells CNN. \"There are just so many places where you wish people had done things differently.\"",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder says Flint's water crisis is to blame for a spike in Legionnaires' disease cases in the city, CNN reports. According to a press release from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, 45 cases of the respiratory disease\u2014which can cause pneumonia and Pontiac fever\u2014were confirmed in Genesee County from June 2014 to March 2015. From May 2015 to November 2015, 42 cases, including one case of Pontiac fever, were reported in Genesee County. Three people died from the disease. \"While Legionellosis cases are not uncommon, we are concerned about the increase in cases seen in Genesee County,\" the MDHHS chief medical executive says. \"We are releasing this report and continuing surveillance and investigations to ensure that appropriate actions are being taken to protect the health of the residents of Flint.\" Legionnaires' disease is caused by Legionella bacteria, which can be found in hot tubs, cooling towers, and water tanks. Snyder says Flint's water crisis is to blame for the increase in cases, MLive.com reports. According to CNN, the city switched to the Flint River for its water in 2014 as a cost-cutting move. The switch caused the bacteria in the water to increase. Legionnaires' disease is not contagious and most people exposed to the bacteria don't get sick.",

USA TODAY \n \n A relative of the victims of the EgyptAir flight 804 wipes her tears as she is comforted at Charles de Gaulle Airport outside of Paris on May 19, 2016. (Photo: Michel Euler, AP) \n \n Debris found Thursday in the Mediterranean Sea was not from an EgyptAir flight that vanished from radar en route from Paris to Cairo early Thursday, an airline official said. \n \n Ahmed Adel, EgyptAir vice chairman, told CNN Thursday that a statement he made earlier to the network was not accurate. \n \n \"We stand corrected on finding the wreckage because what we identified is not a part of our plane,\" Adel told the news organization. \"So the search and rescue is still going on.\" \n \n Adel's statement added to the mounting questions as to what happened to the Airbus 320 that was carrying 56 passengers and 10 crew members, and turned global attention back to the prospect of potential terrorism. \n \n Earlier, Greek officials disputed Egypt's claim that Greek authorities found floating wreckage, including two life vests, from an EgyptAir flight carrying 66 people that crashed into the Mediterranean early Thursday en route from Paris to Cairo. \n \n EgyptAir said the Egyptian foreign ministry confirmed in a letter to the Cairo government that Greek searchers found the debris near the Greek island of Karpathos. But within an hour of that report, Athanassios Binis, head of Greece\u2019s Air Accident Investigation and Aviation Safety Board, told state ERT TV that \u201can assessment of the finds showed that they do not belong to an aircraft.\u201d \n \n Binis said the determination was confirmed by Egyptian authorities, according to the Associated Press.

Paramedics and doctors were on standby in an adjacent alcove ready to assist grief-stricken survivors. \n \n \"Only God knows what happened to them,\" said Mohammed Diab, an uncle of one of the air marshals on the ill-fated jet. \n \n \"All they have told us is the plane is missing,\" said the tearful 72-year-old, even as Egyptian TV broadcasted video of wreckage thought to be from the downed plane floating in the Mediterranean. \"He had been working for EgyptAir for five years and he loved his job,\" Diab said of his 25-year-old nephew. \n \n EgyptAir operates from a hub at Cairo International Airport and is based in Heliopolis, Egypt. It offers passenger and freight services to more than 75 destinations. \n \n In March, EgyptAir Flight 181 en route to Cyprus was hijacked by a passenger claiming to be wearing a suicide belt. The hijacker surrendered at Larnaca International Airport in Cyprus and all passengers were released safely. No one was hurt in the incident, which Cypriot authorities said was not terrorism related. \n \n A Russian passenger plane crashed in Egypt's Sinai peninsula in October, killing all 224 people on board. Moscow said it was brought down by an explosive device, and a local branch of the Islamic State claimed responsibility. \n \n Contributing: Jacob Wirtschafter in Cairo; Nikolia Apostolu from Lesbos, Greece; Maya Vidon in Paris; Melanie Eversley, Gregory Korte in Washington. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/27Ct7fy ||||| U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials are working to gather information on EgyptAir Flight 804, which vanished overnight just as it entered Egyptian airspace. \n \n While the details surrounding the incident are still unclear, Egypt and its flag carrier, EgyptAir, have had a checkered air travel safety record. Two recent incidents in particular have called the country's transportation security into question, reports CBS News correspondent Jeff Pegues. \n \n When EgyptAir Flight 181 was hijacked in March, many initially assumed the motive was terrorism. Claiming to be wearing an explosive vest, 59-year-old Seif Eldin Mustafa demanded the domestic Cairo-bound flight divert to Cyprus. \n \n In a standoff on the tarmac, it was discovered Mustafa's interests were personal. He was arrested and no one was hurt. \n \n The incident renewed security concerns at Egyptian airports, following the crash of a Metrojet flight in October 2015. The Russian passenger plane disintegrated over the Sinai desert after departing from the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, en route for St. Petersburg. All 224 people on board were killed. ISIS soon claimed responsibility for the apparent bomb attack. \n \n In 1985, one of the deadliest hijackings in history was on EgyptAir Flight 648. After departing Athens for Cairo, three heavily armed terrorists forced the plane to land in Malta. On the ground, Egyptian troops raided the aircraft in a move that has since been criticized. At least 58 people on board were killed. \n \n Fourteen years later, EgyptAir Flight 990 crashed off the coast of Nantucket, shortly after taking off from New York. All 217 people on board died. The National Transportation Safety Board concluded the pilot brought down the plane intentionally -- something Egyptian authorities have disputed, instead blaming mechanical failure. \n \n Egypt says it will investigate the latest incident -- what happened to EgyptAir Flight 804 -- joined by French authorities and the plane's manufacturer, Airbus. \n \n There will also be an examination of French aviation safety at airports. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

After reading their story, respondents were asked to rate their feelings of empathy towards the victim. \n \n \"We were surprised by the interaction of age and species,\" Levin said. \"Age seems to trump species, when it comes to eliciting empathy. In addition, it appears that adult humans are viewed as capable of protecting themselves while full grown dogs are just seen as larger puppies.\" \n \n Interestingly, the researchers found that the difference in empathy for children versus puppies was statistically non-significant. \n \n As for considering the opinions of 240 college students, Levin said it is common practice to use homogenous samples for studies such as his that center around an experiment. \"Unlike survey research, experiments usually employ a homogenous sample in order to establish a cause and effect relationship rather than to generalize a large population,\" Levin said. \"However, there is really no reason to believe that our results would differ very much nationally, particularly among college students.\" \n \n While the study focused on dogs and humans, Levin thinks the findings would be similar for cats and people as well. \"Dogs and cats are family pets,\" he said. \"These are animals to which many individuals attribute human characteristics.\" ||||| Puppies may be better at garnering empathy than people are, in some cases, a new study finds. \n \n People have more empathy for abused puppies and dogs than they do for adult humans who have been abused, a new study suggests. \n \n However, empathy for abused children was about the same as that for puppies and dogs, the study found. \n \n Researchers surveyed 240 college students and asked them to read one of four versions of a fictional news article about a brutal beating. The wording in articles was the same, except for the identity of the victim, which was either: an infant, an adult in his 30s, a puppy or a 6-year old dog. Participants then rated their level of empathy for the victim. \n \n Participants had higher levels of empathy for the abused child, puppy and dog than they did for the abused adult, the study found. [See 7 Surprising Health Benefits of Dog Ownership] \n \n The researchers had hypothesized that younger victims would receive more empathy, regardless of species. Instead, they found \"Age makes a difference for empathy toward human victims, but not for dog victims,\" the researchers wrote in their study abstract, which will be presented this week at the American Sociological Association meeting in New York. \n \n \"The fact that adult human crime victims receive less empathy than do child, puppy, and full-grown dog victims suggests that adult dogs are regarded as dependent and vulnerable, not unlike their younger canine counterparts and kids,\" study researcher Jack Levin, a sociology and criminology professor at Northeastern University in Boston, said in a statement. \n \n \"It appears that adult humans are viewed as capable of protecting themselves, while full-grown dogs are just seen as larger puppies,\" Levin said. \n \n The researchers said they suspect they would find similar results if they looked at empathy levels for other abused pets, such as cats. \"These are animals to which many individuals attribute human characteristics,\" Levin said. \n \n Women in the study were more empathetic than men towards human and animal victims. Studies show that women are generally more empathetic than men, Levin said. \"The reason may be partially biological, given the role of females in childbirth and childrearing activities,\" he said. \n \n Because the new study involved only college-age students, it's not clear if the results apply to people who are significantly older or younger. \n \n Follow Rachael Rettner @RachaelRettner.

    "document": "If only Andrew Stanton's John Carter had sneaked into the multiplex with its mostly shirtless Earth-man hero (Taylor Kitsch) fighting fourarmed green dudes and assorted hairy apes from Mars, audiences might have given it a pass as the mildly entertaining, old-school adventure it is. \n \n But nooo! John Carter, a post-Civil War-era Confederate soldier from Virginia who finds himself zapped onto the red planet (called Barsoom instead of Mars), must face a deadlier enemy than author Edgar Rice Burroughs could have dreamed up when he created the character 100 years ago. I'm talking about the toxic buzz that has curled around the movie before anyone had seen it. How dare it cost so much money ($250 million)! How dare Stanton think he can switch from animation (WALL-E, Finding Nemo) to directing live actors! How dare they rip off Star Wars, Indiana Jones and Avatar? (Hey, haters: Burroughs got there first.) \n \n My advice? Shut out the noise and just watch the movie. For all the bumps in the narrative, concocted by Stanton, Mark Andrews and novelist Michael Chabon, and less-than-stellar 3D effects, John Carter exerts the pull of a tall tale told by a campfire. Stanton takes his time to show us how life lost meaning for Captain Carter after the war. And the Canadian Kitsch, so fine as the alcoholic bad boy on Friday Night Lights, brings a bruised heart and welcome gravity to a role a lesser actor might have turned into heroic cardboard. It's fun to watch JC find that the atmosphere on Mars allows him to leap around like a human shot put. And though it's shameless to give JC a mutt as a protector, Woola \u2013 the toothy, 10-legged lizard dog \u2013 is a beauty of a beast. Uggie from The Artist needs to watch his back. \n \n I've been avoiding the plot, since its convolutions are headspinning. Burroughs, who later created Tarzan, wrote 11 books on Carter. You may leave this movie never knowing the difference between a Thark and a Thern. Willem Dafoe's matchless growl enlivens Tars Tarkas, a 10-foot-tall Thark who befriends JC. And Mark Strong, as the shapeshifting Matai Shang, is one wily Thern. But you will know that JC truly loves Dejah Thoris (the excellent Lynn Collins), a defiant princess who won't stand behind any man in a fight. John Carter bites off more than even Woola can chew, but it's built on something rare: wonder instead of Hollywood cynicism. ||||| The mess that is \"John Carter\" is signaled early on when our hero finds himself on a strange planet that literally puts a bounce in his step. Why, he could leap tall buildings in a single bound. Instead, John, played with chest-baring kitsch by \"Friday Night Lights\" Taylor Kitsch , ends up sprawled on his face, eating a lot of dirt.Sadly, John's problems are \"John Carter's\" problems, it's just that while our hero eventually figures out how to stop falling down, the movie never does. \"John Carter\" is the latest version of a long and rich Hollywood tradition: The big-budget (a reported $250-million-plus) fiasco. It's enough to make your jaw drop.That \"John Carter\" is so hit and miss, and miss, and miss is unfortunate on any number of levels. It starts with a great story \u2014 of love and politics, time travel and mystical pathways between planets \u2014 badly sucked dry. Based on \"A Princess of Mars,\" the post-Civil War/pre-Tarzan brainchild of arguably one of the most entertaining non-Disney imagineers of all times, Edgar Rice Burroughs , the book and the Barsoom (a.k.a. Mars) series that would follow has been picked over for plot points by Hollywood for years.So what will feel like ideas stolen from other movies in \"John Carter\" (echoes of \" Star Wars ,\" \"Star Trek,\" Superman ,\" to name just a few),is really more a case of going back to the source. But just as you can't put Pandora back in the box, filmmaker Andrew Stanton can't find a way to make Burroughs' now-familiar fantasy themes feel fresh.Stanton, who directed and shares writing credit with Mark Andrews and novelist Michael Chabon , is a Pixar veteran who won an Oscar for 2004's \"Finding Nemo\" and another for 2008's \" Wall-E ,\" both wonderful mixes of fun and fantasy. But in making the move from animation to live action, he never finds his footing. There is much more heart in \"Wall-E's\" junkyard robot and in the merest flick of Nemo's fin than you'll find in all of Barsoom with its dying-planet woes, warring factions, beautiful warrior princess and brazen four-armed green alien savages, despite its fantastic look.The film starts playfully and promisingly in some dusty Western outpost on planet Earth with John, a former Southern Civil War hero, conscripted by the cavalry to help tame the badlands and the Indian tribes. Or at least they try, making for one of the film's funnier bits, because John has other things on his mind. Soon both he and we will be transported to Barsoom (Mars to both John and to us) with the help of a cheesy-looking medallion. Getting back is even weirder, what with the chanting that's required to activate some not-so-special special effects.There is a glimpse of the red planet's issues before John gets involved, starting with a raging battle with very cool spaceships that look like ancient sailing vessels plucked out of the sea. It serves to introduce the chief villain, a fierce Zodanga fighter named Sab Than ( Dominic West ), and the difficulties that ultimately undo the writers: How to fill in a complex back story for newcomers without boring fans.Sab is just the beginning of Barsoom's problems. It turns out that he's under the control of the shape-shifting, agenda-setting immortal Therns, with Matai Shang ( Mark Strong ) the main man of action here. Meanwhile, Sab is out to crush the residents of Helium, the smart, peaceful set, with the first step to marry their beloved princess, Dejah Thoris ( Lynn Collins ). Then there are the Tharks, multi-armed green savages riding around in their loincloths, staging barbaric arena-style spectacles and waiting for Helium and Zodanga to destroy each other. And you thought our planet was in trouble.Once John does land, dazed and confused, on a Martian desert, he's captured by Thark leader Tars Tarkas ( Willem Dafoe ). Tars is entertained enough by John's jumping that he saves him, and soon John's fate is tied to another Thark, Sola ( Samantha Morton ), something of a rule-breaker herself. Eventually circumstance will throw John in Dejah's path, sparks will fly, sort of, plans will be hatched, and so on.All of the intrigues play out against an exceptionally fine background, from the cave dwellings of the Tharks, whose misunderstanding of John's name provides the film its best running gag, to the towering spires of Helium. Barsoom's barren wasteland is a terrific visual staging ground for the many battles to come and where Stanton's strengths come to the surface. The action itself is intricate but ultimately not that satisfying since, even as guns blaze, there is never a feeling of real jeopardy.Kitsch, who has brought so many moods and so much swagger to his football bad boy in \"Friday Night Lights,\" simply fades here. When John should overpower not only his enemies but that very big screen, it never happens. Meanwhile, Collins ( \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\" ) is much better when she's armed and dangerous than when she's smitten. All of which leaves \"John Carter\" in serious need of someone, something, to really root for other than this two-hour-plus film to finally end. ||||| John Carter \n \n March 7, 2012 \n \n Cast & Credits John Carter Taylor Kitsch \n \n Dejah Thoris Lynn Collins \n \n Tars Tarkas Willem Dafoe \n \n Tal Hajus Thomas Haden Church \n \n Sola Samantha Morton \n \n Sab Than Dominic West \n \n Tardos Mors Ciaran Hinds \n \n \n \n Disney presents a film directed by Andrew Stanton. Written by Stanton and Mark Andrews, based on the story \u201cA Princessof Mars\u201d by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Running time: 132 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for intense sequences of violence and action). Printer-friendly \u00bb \n \n E-mail this to a friend \u00bb \n \n I don't see any way to begin a review of \"John Carter\" without referring to \"Through Time and Space With Ferdinand Feghoot.\" That was a series of little stories that appeared in the magazine Fantasy and Science Fiction from 1956 to 1973 and had a great influence on my development as a critic. In one of the Feghoot adventures, the hero finds himself on Mars and engaged in bloody swordplay. He is sliced in the leg. Then in the other leg. Then an arm is hacked off. \"To hell with this,\" Feghoot exclaims, unholstering his ray gun and vaporizing his enemies. \n \n I may have one or two details wrong, but you understand the point: When superior technology is at hand, it seems absurd for heroes to limit themselves to swords. When airships the size of a city block can float above a battle, why handicap yourself with cavalry charges involving lumbering alien rhinos? When it is possible to teleport yourself from Earth to Mars, why are you considered extraordinary because you can jump really high? \n \n \n \n Such questions are never asked in the world of \"John Carter,\" and as a result, the movie is more Western than science fiction. Even if we completely suspend our disbelief and accept the entire story at face value, isn't it underwhelming to spend so much time looking at hand-to-hand combat when there are so many neat toys and gadgets to play with? \n \n \n \n But I must not review a movie that wasn't made. What we have here is a rousing boy's adventure story, adapted from stories that Edgar Rice Burroughs cranked out for early pulp magazines. They lacked the visceral appeal of his Tarzan stories, which inspired an estimated 89 movies; amazingly, this is the first John Carter movie, but it is intended to foster a franchise and will probably succeed. \n \n \n \n Burroughs' hero is a Civil War veteran who finds himself in the Monument Valley, where he has an encounter that transports him to the red planet Mars. This is not the Mars that NASA's Rovers are poking into, but the Mars envisioned at the time Burroughs was writing, which the astronomer Percival Lowell claimed was criss-crossed by a system of canals. Luckily for Carter, it has an atmosphere that he can breathe and surface temperatures allowing him do without a shirt. In a delightful early scene, he finds that his Earth muscles allow him great leaps and bounds in the lower Martian gravity. \n \n \n \n This attracts the attention of the inhabitants of Mars, represented by two apparently human cities at war with each other, and a native race called the Tharks, who look like a vague humanoid blend of weird green aliens from old covers of Thrilling Wonder Stories. They have four arms, and it was a great disappointment to me that we never saw a Thark putting on a shirt. John Carter feels an immediate affinity for the Tharks and also gets recruited into the war of the cities \u2014 choosing the side with a fiery beauty named Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins, who is the movie's best character). \n \n \n \n John Carter is played by Taylor Kitsch, who co-starred with Collins in \"Wolverine.\" Yes, I agree Kitsch is a curious name for a star in action movies. Still, that is his real name, and one can wonder how many fans of \"Wolverine,\" for example, are familiar with the word or its meaning. As an actor, he is perfectly serviceable as a sword-wielding, rhino-riding savior of planets. \n \n \n \n The film was directed by Andrew Stanton, whose credits include \"A Bug's Life\" (1998), \"Finding Nemo\" (2003) and \"WALL-E\" (2008). All three have tight, well-structured plots, and that's what \"John Carter\" could use more of. The action sequences are generally well-executed, but they're too much of a muchness. CGI makes them seem too facile and not tactile enough. Although I liked the scene where Carter was getting his Mars legs with his first low-gravity steps, the sight of him springing into the air like a jumping jack could inspire bad laughs. \n \n \n \n Does \"John Carter\" get the job done for the weekend action audience? Yes, I suppose it does. The massive city on legs that stomps across the landscape is well-done. The Tharks are ingenious, although I'm not sure why they need tusks. Lynn Collins makes a terrific heroine. And I enjoyed the story outside the story, about how Burroughs wrote a journal about what he saw and appears briefly as character. He may even turn up in sequels. After all, he wrote some.",

    "document": "SPARTANBURG, S.C. -- A South Carolina serial killer already serving life in prison for seven slayings told authorities he has two additional victims buried near an interstate, a sheriff said Tuesday. Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said investigators are bringing Todd Kohlhepp to the county to lead them to the supposed location of the bodies, the Greenville News reported. \n \n \"We're trying to get a game plan together to find out exactly where and what to do. Investigators have been talking to him,\" Wright said. \"We're not going to try to keep that quiet. We're going to go search.\" \n \n Kohlhepp told investigators that two people are buried near Interstate 26 in Spartanburg County in the northwest part of the state. Wright is unsure who the supposed additional victims are or exactly where they are, he said. \n \n \"We haven't been able to confirm anything he's claimed yet,\" Wright said. \"It's not to say that the details are not sketchy because it's been so long, but we're obligated to go check.\" \n \n Kohlhepp is serving seven consecutive life sentences without parole at Broad River Correctional Facility in Columbia after pleading guilty to multiple charges in May 2017. \"48 Hours\" investigated the case in the episode, \"Buried Truth.\" \n \n His string of crimes was uncovered in 2016 after police rescued Kala Brown from a storage container where she was chained at the neck and investigators found a body buried in a shallow grave. Brown told investigators she saw Kohlhepp shoot and kill her boyfriend, 32-year-old Charles Carter, who went with her for a cleaning job on Kohlhepp's property in rural Spartanburg County. \n \n Kohlhepp raped Brown while holding her against her will, and told her he had also killed a husband and wife in December 2015, burying their bodies on his land. Johnny Joe Coxie, 29, had been killed immediately, and Kohlhepp kept 26-year-old Meagan Leigh McCraw-Coxie alive for six days before shooting her in the back of the head on Christmas, Solicitor Barry Barnette said. \n \n The Associated Press typically doesn't identify victims of sexual assault, but Brown has spoken publicly about her traumatic experience. \n \n Kohlhepp admitted to her that he had killed four people in the Superbike motorcycle shop in November 2003, the prosecutor said. The owner, Scott Ponder, 30; Beverly Guy, 52; Brian Lucas, 30; and Chris Sherbert, 26 were killed because Kohlhepp thought they were making fun of him. Guy was Ponder's mother and worked as a bookkeeper. Lucas was a service manager, and Sherbert was a mechanic at the shop. \n \n Kohlhepp's crimes took place over more than a decade as he ran a real estate business. \n \n According to the plea agreement signed by Kohlhepp, he will serve seven consecutive life terms plus 60 years on kidnapping, sexual assault and other charges. Kohlhepp will not be eligible for parole, and he also agreed not to appeal the sentence. \n \n Kohlhepp moved to South Carolina in 2001 shortly after 14 years in prison for pleading guilty to kidnapping in Arizona. Authorities there said the then 15-year-old forced a 14-year-old neighbor back to his home at gunpoint, tied her up and raped her. \n \n Friends and co-workers at Kohlhepp's real estate business said he was a hard worker with some strange habits. He would watch pornographic videos during work and joked on his firm's website that he motivated workers by not feeding them. ||||| The Upstate's most notorious serial killer's claim that there were two more bodies buried in Spartanburg County led to a search Wednesday that failed to turn up anything, officials said. \n \n Sheriff Chuck Wright said Tuesday that Todd Kohlhepp claimed the bodies were in the Enoree area. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \"He didn't tell me. He didn't tell our investigators. He told somebody who told us,\" Wright told WYFF News 4 Tuesday night. \n \n Lt. Kevin Bobo released the following statement after the search concluded: \n \n \u201cWhen Todd Kohlhepp was arrested in November, 2016, he made vague statements to our investigators about committing two homicides prior to the Superbike incident. \n \n \u201cAt that time, we researched his statement and found no evidence to support his claim. \n \n \u201cSince his incarceration at the S.C. Department of Corrections, he made that same claim to a production company that is filing a documentary about his crimes, but his account to that company differed in some details and also included possible locations of these two alleged victims. \n \n \u201cLast week, two of our investigators went to the Department of Corrections and interviewed Kohlhepp. Some of the details he shared with our investigators differed from what he had shared with the production company; specifically, that the victims were buried in one location as opposed to two different ones. \n \n \u201cThose investigators asked Kohlhepp if he would be willing to show us the location of these two alleged victims. Todd Kohlhepp declined that request. \n \n \u201cMonday and Tuesday, our investigators met with the production company and compared notes to see what was consistent in Kohlhepp\u2019s claims and what wasn\u2019t. That additional research led to numerous deputies and cadaver dogs searching a wooded area at the dead end of a frontage road at Highway 92 and I-26 in Enoree. \n \n \u201cAgain, we didn\u2019t find any evidence to support his claim. At present, there aren\u2019t any plans to go back to the site tomorrow, and that lead will be suspended until Kohlhepp decides to share more detailed information that can be verified.\u201d \n \n Maria Awes, senior vice president of Committee Films, confirmed in a statement late Wednesday afternoon that her company is working on the Kohlhepp documentary. \n \n \u201cWe are currently on the ground filming an exclusive documentary series about Todd Kohlhepp, airing next year on the true crime and justice channel, Investigation Discovery (ID). \n \n \u201cAs this is an active investigation, we are working closely with law enforcement to be completely transparent with our information and filming only within their specified parameters.\u201d \n \n Tuesday, Wright had said he felt like he was \"between a rock and a hard place\" because Kohlhepp killed seven people, so they had to check it out. \n \n The search for more victims \n \n Deputies and K-9's began to search about 9 a.m. \n \n \u201cThis will be the last time this happens until he gives me some specifics that I can corroborate, because I don\u2019t want it to be one of those things \u2013 he wants to stay relevant,\u201d Wright said. \u201cIf he\u2019s got more victims, I promise you, there are no limits to what we won\u2019t do, within the law.

The film makers who are producing a documentary on Kohlhepp's victims were also at the scene. Wright said he allowed them to shoot the search \"from a distance.\" \n \n He said the nonprofit group Foothills Search and Rescue's dogs were used in the search. Wright said the dogs are capable of finding bodies several feet underground, even if they have been buried for years. \n \n Wright said if they had found any spots they wanted to investigate further, there was an industrial X-ray machine at the scene that is capable of detecting items buried 5 to 7 feet underground. \n \n Kohlhepp is an admitted serial killer \n \n Kohlhepp, 47, is serving seven consecutive life sentences plus an additional 60 years in prison after admitting he killed seven people and sexually assaulted a woman that he held captive in a storage container in November 2016. \n \n Kohlhepp confessed that he killed Beverly Guy, Scott Ponder, Brian Lucas and Chris Sherbert in November 2003 at Superbike Motorsports. \n \n He confessed to the Superbike Motorsports killings after investigators found Kala Brown, a woman who had been reported missing, on Nov. 4, 2016, chained inside a storage container on Kohlhepp\u2019s property in rural Woodruff. \n \n She had been reported missing two months before.

    "document": "Photo \n \n \u2014 The Norwegian man charged Saturday with a pair of attacks in Oslo that killed at least 92 people left behind a detailed manifesto outlining his preparations and calling for a Christian war to defend Europe against the threat of Muslim domination, according to Norwegian and American officials familiar with the investigation. \n \n As stunned Norwegians grappled with the deadliest attack in the country since World War II, a portrait began to emerge of the suspect, Anders Behring Breivik , 32. The police identified him as a right-wing fundamentalist Christian, while acquaintances described him as a gun-loving Norwegian obsessed with what he saw as the threats of multiculturalism and Muslim immigration . \n \n \u201cWe are not sure whether he was alone or had help,\u201d a police official, Roger Andresen, said at a televised news conference. \u201cWhat we know is that he is right wing and a Christian fundamentalist.\u201d \n \n In the 1,500-page manifesto, posted on the Web hours before the attacks, Mr. Breivik recorded a day-by-day diary of months of planning for the attacks, and claimed to be part of a small group that intended to \u201cseize political and military control of Western European countries and implement a cultural conservative political agenda.\u201d \n \n He predicted a conflagration that would kill or injure more than a million people, adding, \u201cThe time for dialogue is over. We gave peace a chance. The time for armed resistance has come.\u201d \n \n The manifesto was signed Andrew Berwick, an Anglicized version of his name. A former American government official briefed on the case said investigators believed the manifesto was Mr. Breivik\u2019s work. \n \n The manifesto, entitled \u201c2083: A European Declaration of Independence,\u201d equates liberalism and multiculturalism with \u201ccultural Marxism,\u201d which the document says is destroying European Christian civilization. \n \n The document also describes a secret meeting in London in April 2002 to reconstitute the Knights Templar, a Crusader military order. It says the meeting was attended by nine representatives of eight European countries, evidently including Mr. Breivik, with an additional three members unable to attend, including a \u201cEuropean-American.\u201d \n \n The document does not name the attendees or say whether they were aware of Mr. Breivik\u2019s planned attacks, though investigators presumably will now try to determine if the people exist and what their connection is to Mr. Breivik. \n \n Photo \n \n Thomas Hegghammer, a terrorism specialist at the Norwegian Defense Research Establishment, said the manifesto bears an eerie resemblance to those of Osama bin Laden and other Al Qaeda leaders, though from a Christian rather than a Muslim point of view. Like Mr. Breivik\u2019s manuscript, the major Qaeda declarations have detailed accounts of the Crusades, a pronounced sense of historical grievance and calls for apocalyptic warfare to defeat the religious and cultural enemy. \n \n \u201cIt seems to be an attempt to mirror Al Qaeda, exactly in reverse,\u201d Mr. Hegghammer said. \n \n Mr. Breivik was also believed to have posted a video on Friday summarizing his arguments. In its closing moments, the video depicts Mr. Breivik in military uniform, holding assault weapons. Rarely has a mass murder suspect left so detailed an account of his activities. The manifesto describes in detail his purchase of chemicals, his sometimes ham-handed experiments making explosives and his first successful test detonation of a bomb in a remote location on June 13. \n \n He intersperses the account of bomb-making with details of his television-watching, including the Eurovision music contest and the American police drama \u201cThe Shield.\u201d \n \n The manifesto ends with a chilling signoff: \u201cI believe this will be my last entry. It is now Fri July 22nd, 12.51.\u201d \n \n Indeed, the operation appeared to have been extremely well planned. \n \n According to the police, Mr. Breivik first drew security services to central Oslo when he exploded a car bomb outside a 17-story government office building, killing at least seven people. \n \n Then he took a public ferry to Utoya Island, where he carried out a remarkably meticulous attack on Norway \u2019s current and future political elite. Dressed as a police officer, he announced that he had come to check on the security of the young people who were attending a political summer camp there, many of them the children of members of the governing Labor Party . \n \n He gathered the campers together and for some 90 hellish minutes he coolly and methodically shot them, hunting down those who fled. At least 85 people, some as young as 16, were killed. \n \n The police said Saturday evening that they expected the death toll to climb. There were still bodies in the bombed government buildings in Oslo, and at least four people missing on Utoya. \n \n The police also said that unexploded munitions were still in some downtown Oslo buildings, and they had not ruled out the possibility that Mr. Breivik had accomplices. \n \n He was equipped, the police said, with an automatic rifle and a handgun; when the police finally got to the island \u2014 about 40 minutes after they were called, the police said \u2014 Mr. Breivik surrendered. \n \n Photo \n \n The police also said he had registered a farm in Rena, in eastern Norway, which allowed him to order a large quantity of ammonium nitrate fertilizer, an ingredient that can be used to make explosives. The authorities were investigating whether the chemical had been used in the bombing. \n \n Besides the manifesto, Mr. Breivik left other hints of his motives. \n \n A Facebook page and Twitter account were set up under his name days before the rampage. The Facebook page cites philosophers like Machiavelli, Kant and John Stuart Mill. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

He never shared any extreme thoughts or speech with us. There was absolutely no reason to expect that he could do something like this. We\u2019re very shocked.\u201d \n \n Mr. Breivik quit the party in 2006, apparently disappointed by the party\u2019s move toward the center. \n \n \u201cHe didn\u2019t like our politics, I guess, and moved on,\u201d Mr. Kallmyr said. \n \n His Internet posts also indicated contempt for the Conservative Party, which he accused of having given up the battle against multiculturalism. \n \n But on Friday he directed his firepower at the center-left Labor Party, which leads the coalition government. \n \n \u201cBreivik feels that multiculturalism is destroying the society and that the enforcing authority is the prime minister and the Labor Party, the lead party of contemporary Norwegian politics,\u201d said Anders Romarheim, a fellow at the Norwegian Institute for Defense Studies. \n \n Photo \n \n But the attacks, along with what appear to have been years of preparation for them, raised questions about whether the Norwegian security authorities, concentrating on threats of Islamic terrorism, had overlooked the threat from the anti-Islamic right. \n \n \u201cThis is the Norwegian equivalent to Timothy McVeigh ,\u201d the right-wing American who bombed a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995, said Marcus Buck, a political scientist at the University of Tromso in northern Norway. \u201cThis is right-wing domestic terrorism, and the big question is to what extent Norwegian agencies have diverted their attention from what they knew decades ago was the biggest threat\u201d to focus instead on Islamic militants. \n \n The unclassified versions of the last three Norwegian Police Security Service reports assessing national threats all played down any threat by right-wing and nationalist extremists. Instead, the reports emphasized the dangers posed by radical Islam, groups opposed to Norway\u2019s military involvement in Afghanistan and Libya , and others. \n \n The 2011 report, released early this year, concluded that \u201cthe far-right and far-left extremist communities will not represent a serious threat to Norwegian society.\u201d \n \n Even after the attacks, that appeared to be the official position. \n \n \u201cCompared to other countries I wouldn\u2019t say we have a big problem with right-wing extremists in Norway,\u201d Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg told reporters at a news conference on Saturday. \u201cBut we have had some groups, we have followed them before, and our police is aware that there are some right-wing groups.\u201d \n \n Even if the authorities had focused on right-wing groups, it was unlikely that they would have noticed Mr. Breivik. \n \n Kari Helene Partapuoli, director of the Norwegian Center Against Racism, said Mr. Breivik did not belong to any violent neo-Nazi groups that she was aware of, and his Internet postings, before those of last week, did not espouse violence. \n \n \u201cThe distance between the words spoken and the acts that he carried out is gigantic, because what he did is in a different league of what the debates have to do about,\u201d she said. \n \n Arild Groven, secretary general of the Norwegian Shooting Association, a sports group, confirmed that Mr. Breivik had belonged to Oslo Pistolklubb, one of the 520 clubs in the association. \n \n \u201cWe all read and watch the news about the shootings in the United States ,\u201d Mr. Groven said. \u201cBut it doesn\u2019t happen here.\u201d \n \n Mr. Romarheim said in some ways the homegrown nature of the attack made it harder for Norwegians to accept. \u201cWith 9/11 in America, people could ask, \u2018Who are they?\u2019 and could pour their rage out on someone else,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t disavow this person, he\u2019s one of us.\u201d ||||| The man blamed for attacks on Norway's government headquarters and a youth retreat said he was motivated by a desire to bring about a revolution in Norwegian society, his lawyer said Sunday. \n \n EDS NOTE: IMAGE HAS BEEN DIGITALLY ALTERED BY THE ORIGINAL SOURCE TO REMOVE THE BACKGROUND - This image shows Anders Behring Breivik from a manifesto attributed to him that was discovered Saturday, July...

(Associated Press) \n \n A manifesto published online _ which police are perusing and said was posted the day of the attack _ ranted that the European elite, \"multiculturalists\" and \"enablers of Islamization\" would be punished for their \"treasonous acts.\" Police have not confirmed that their suspect, 32-year-old Anders Behring Breivik, wrote the document, but his lawyer referred to it and said Breivik had been working on it for years. \n \n Police and his lawyer have said that Breivik confessed to the twin attacks, but denied criminal responsibility for a day that shook peaceful Norway to its core and was the deadliest ever in peacetime. He has been charged with terrorism and will be arraigned on Monday. \n \n In all, 92 people were killed and 97 wounded. There are still people missing at both scenes, and divers searched the waters around the island Saturday for bodies. Body parts remain inside the Oslo building, which housed the prime minister's office. \n \n Norway's King Harald V and his wife Queen Sonja and Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg joined mourners on Sunday at Oslo Cathedral, where the pews were packed, and the crowd spilled into the plaza outside the building. The area was strewn with flowers and candles, and people who could not fit in the grand church huddled under umbrellas in the rain. \n \n More was coming to light Sunday about the man who police say confessed to a car bomb at government headquarters in Oslo and then, hours later, opening fire on young people at an island political retreat. Both targets were linked to Norway's left-leaning Labor Party, and authorities have said Breivik held anti-Muslim views and posted on Christian fundamentalist websites. \n \n \"He wanted a change in society and, from his perspective, he needed to force through a revolution,\" Geir Lippestad, his lawyer, told public broadcaster NRK. \"He wished to attack society and the structure of society.\" \n \n Lippestad said Breivik spent years writing the 1,500-page manifesto that police were examining. It was signed \"Andrew Berwick\" _ an apparent anglicization of his name. \n \n Police Chief Sveinung Sponheim said there was no indication whether Breivik had selected his targets or fired randomly on the island. The manifesto vowed revenge on those who had betrayed Europe. \n \n \"We, the free indigenous peoples of Europe, hereby declare a pre-emptive war on all cultural Marxist/multiculturalist elites of Western Europe. ... We know who you are, where you live and we are coming for you,\" the document said. \"We are in the process of flagging every single multculturalist traitor in Western Europe. You will be punished for your treasonous acts against Europe and Europeans.\" \n \n Police spokesman John Fredriksen confirmed that the essay was posted the day of the attacks. The document signaled an attack was imminent: \"In order to successfully penetrate the cultural Marxist/multiculturalist media censorship, we are forced to employ significantly more brutal and breath-taking operations, which will result in casualties.\" \n \n Witnesses at the island youth retreat described the way Breivik lured them close by saying he was a police officer before raising his weapons. People hid and fled into the water to escape the rampage; some played dead. \n \n While some on the island reported that there was a second assailant and police said they were looking into that, Lippestad, the lawyer, said his client claims to have acted alone. \n \n Police took 90 minutes from the first shot to reach the island _ delayed because they did not have quick access to a helicopter and struggled to find a boat once they reached the lake. Breivik surrendered when they reached him, but before 85 people died. Another seven were killed in the bombing. \n \n ___ \n \n DiLorenzo reported from Stockholm.

    "document": "Lululemon said it was pulling its popular black yoga pants from stores after some of them were found to be overly sheer. Shares tumbled. Andria Cheng reports. Photo: Reuters. \n \n A Taiwanese supplier to Lululemon Athletica Inc. was bent out of shape on Tuesday after the yoga-clothes retailer blamed it for producing a shipment of pants that were unacceptably see-through. \n \n The supplier, Eclat Textile Co. of Taiwan, hit back at Lululemon, saying the clothes it shipped weren't \"problematic.\" \n \n \"All shipments to Lululemon went through a certification process which Lululemon had approved,\" Eclat Chief Financial Officer Roger Lo said in an interview. \"All the pants were manufactured according to the requirements set out in the contract with Lululemon.\" \n \n The Canadian company has built a billion-dollar business selling premium yoga gear at high prices, but the glitch with the recalled pants marks yet another recent stumble with products on its store shelves. The disclosure late Monday about the black Luon pants\u2014one of its core items\u2014followed a string of complaints last year that the colors were bleeding on some of its tops. \n \n With the black Luon pant recall, Lululemon has now had its fourth quality-control issue in the past year, Credit Suisse analyst Christian Buss said. In addition to the problem with bright colors bleeding, the company had transparency problems with some colors of swimwear shipped for last spring as well as a subset of light colored pants, Mr. Buss said. \n \n The string of glitches is a setback for a company that has attracted a devoted following for its high-end yoga wear, which faces growing competition. \n \n Last July, Chief Product Officer Sheree Waterson posted an apology on Facebook for the colorfastness problem, long after complaints started cropping up. Two months later, CEO Christine Day mentioned the issue during an earnings call, acknowledging bleeding issues with colors including \"Paris Pink\" in \"a couple of small, isolated issues.\" \n \n This time, the company moved more aggressively, pulling all of the pants from stores and offering refunds, leading it to cut its sales first quarter forecast by around $20 million. \n \n Some analysts expressed concern about the company's quality control. \n \n Enlarge Image Close REUTERS A Lululemon Athletic shop in San Francisco. \n \n Analysts at Sterne Agee said the company doesn't appear to be exercising enough supervision of its supply chain. \n \n \"We are concerned that LULU does not have the appropriate presence in and around its factories,\" the analysts said. \"It appears that there is not appropriate oversight in place.\" \n \n Lululemon wouldn't comment on its supervision of suppliers. \n \n Linda Goldstein, vice president of sourcing, quality and production at Lululemon, said in an interview that the company's sourcing manager for raw materials is currently at Eclat's facilities in Taiwan. Lululemon has yet to determine the cause of the problem, she said. \n \n Lululemon relies heavily on a limited number of suppliers, a risk it called out in its annual report in March 2012. The Luon fabric at issue in the see-through pants comes from that one supplier. \n \n Ms. Day has intentionally kept supplies of hot sellers low in order to create scarcity and buzz\u2014and to ensure customers pay full price as often as possible. \n \n Lululemon's shares were down almost 5% in early trading Tuesday, although they rebounded to finish at $64.08, down 2.3%, on the Nasdaq. \n \n The company's shares, after rising by about two-thirds last year, are down nearly 18% so far in 2013. \n \n Write to Aries Poon at aries.poon@dowjones.com and Karen Talley at karen.talley@dowjones.com ||||| After customers complained that a batch of the company's signature yoga pants were too transparent, Lululemon tried to make a scapegoat out of the Taiwanese company that manufactures the pants. Bad idea. Said supplier now says the pants were no different than any other batch. The Eclat Textile Company, whose clients include everyone from Gap to Under Armour, said Tuesday that Lululemon had signed off on the shipment, suggesting that Lululemon made the whole thing up. \"All shipments to Lululemon went through a certification process which Lululemon had approved,\" Eclat's chief executive Roger Lo told The Wall Street Journal. \"All the pants were manufactured according to the requirements set out in the contract with Lululemon.\" Ladies and gentlemen, we have a yoga pants scandal on our hands. \n \n So which one is it? Did Eclat make a bad batch of $100 yoga pants, or did Lululemon just design transparent $100 yoga pants and milk the market for as long as it could? It's really hard to say. When Lo talked to the press, he said that Lululemon hadn't contacted his company about the recall \u2014 which is kind of weird since Lululemon effectively blamed Eclat for screwing up the \"level of sheerness\" during the manufacturing process. (It's worth pointing out that Lululemon also said it was working closely with the manufacturer \"to understand what happened during the period this fabric was made.\") It's possible that there's a third party, some company that supplied Eclat with the fabric for the pants, clearing it somewhat from the blame. But at this point, this particular incident really is a frustrating finger-pointing match that's left Lululemon out about $20 million in lost sales and a whole lot yogis out of high-priced pants. \n \n Let's get real about this stretchy trousers tale, though. It's pretty obvious that the supplier gains nothing by saddling the blame, however the perhaps unexpected media circus that gathered around this see-through yoga pants scandal highlighted a number of questionable incidents in recent Lululemon history. As a Credit Suisse analyst pointed out in a note to clients that this is Lululemon's \"fourth quality control issue in the last year.\" Not counting this latest debacle, two out of the other three issues involved the sheerness of its fabrics. Clearly, something is up. \n \n Along these lines, other analysts suggested that Lululemon needs to spend more time in Taiwan to make sure the manufacturers' work is up to snuff. No matter whose at fault in the growing list Lululemon's quality control issues, it can't hurt to get to the root of the problem. Then maybe next time, someone will spot the bad batch, before they ship $20 million worth of transparent yoga pants around the world. \n \n Want to add to this story? Let us know in comments. You can share ideas for stories on the Open Wire. \n \n Adam Clark Estes",

Anthony Scaramucci \n \n > Occupation: White House Communications Director \n \n Over the nearly five decades that the position of the White House Director of Communications has existed, no tenure has been shorter than that of Anthony Scaramucci. Fired in late July 2017, less than two weeks after his appointment, the White House\u2019s official reason for releasing Scaramucci was to give its new Chief of Staff, General John Kelly, a clean slate. Scaramucci\u2019s tenure in Trump\u2019s cabinet was tumultuous despite being short. The highlights included apparent protocol breaches with the FBI, conflicting statements about his relationship with then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and a profanity laced interview with The New Yorker, in which he spoke ill of several other Trump administration officials, including Priebus and Chief Strategist Steve Bannon. In the midst of his brief stint in the White House, Scaramucci\u2019s wife filed for divorce. \n \n Source: Gage Skidmore / Flickr \n \n 2. Chris Christie \n \n > Occupation: Governor of New Jersey \n \n Governor of New Jersey and contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination Chris Christie has the lowest approval ratings of any governor in the country and in the history of the Garden State. It\u2019s not hard to see why. The lame duck two-term governor fawned over Donald Trump after the bombastic billionaire won the presidential election. Many speculated Christie was angling for a post in the new administration. Trump did name Christie to head his transition team, but eventually replaced him with Mike Pence. In the end, Trump decided not to include Christie in his cabinet, possibly because Christie was damaged goods. Indeed, Christie\u2019s reputation was sullied by the Bridgegate scandal in which allies created a traffic jam on the George Washington Bridge in early September 2013, hoping motorists would blame a local Democratic mayor for the tie-up. \n \n The outgoing governor said he does not care about poll numbers. That seemed to be the case last month when Christie and his family were spotted lounging on a state-owned beach while the general public was denied beach access due to a statewide government shutdown. \n \n Source: Federal Bureau of Investigation \n \n 3. James Comey \n \n > Occupation: Director of the FBI \n \n James Comey has been a controversial figure since the middle of the 2016 presidential election. Initially, Comey was criticized for publicly attacking Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s judgment in using a private email server during her time at the State Department. Comey garnered even more ire when, in an apparent break with bureau protocol, he announced candidate Clinton was the subject of an FBI investigation only days before the election. While some attribute President Donald Trump\u2019s electoral victory to Comey\u2019s investigation of Clinton, Trump abruptly fired the FBI Director less than five months into his presidency. \n \n Comey had served as FBI Director since 2013, when he was appointment by President Barack Obama, until he was terminated by Trump in May 2017. The White House has since provided multiple conflicting justifications for Comey\u2019s firing. \n \n Source: media.ford.com \n \n 4. Mark Fields \n \n > Occupation: CEO of Ford Motor Company \n \n Mark Fields, formerly chief executive of Ford Motor Company, is one of several high profile CEOs who were shown the door in 2017. A loyal company man, Fields had been with Ford since 1989, working his way up to COO in 2012 and CEO in 2014. \n \n Fields\u2019 time at the top was limited largely due to his failure to inspire confidence on Wall Street. Ford shares fell by nearly 40% during his tenure as CEO \u2014 even as corporate revenue climbed over 5% from 2014 to 2016. Shareholder confidence was mostly undermined by Fields\u2019 determination to take on Tesla, investing in electric and autonomous vehicle technology. Despite attempts to woo shareholders by announcing a 10% reduction in its global workforce in early May 2017 in order to boost profits, Fields was let go later that month. \n \n Source: Flickr / Keith Allison \n \n 5. Tiger Woods \n \n > Occupation: Professional golfer \n \n With 14 major wins to his name, including four Masters Tournaments and three U.S. Opens, Tiger Woods spent many years as the top-ranked golfer in the world. The golf superstar has been embroiled in controversy on and off since reports of his infidelity came to light in late 2009. He has not won a major tournament since. \n \n The latest scandal surrounding Woods was what appeared to be a DUI arrest. Found by police stopped on the side of the road early morning on Memorial Day, Woods failed a field sobriety test and was arrested. At the station, Woods passed a breathalyzer, however, and it was later revealed that the golfer was suffering from a dangerous combination of prescription medications. Following the widely publicized incident, Woods checked into a clinic to help him manage his drug use.

    "document": "Robin Williams, who died unexpectedly today at 63, was hugely admired among his own generation -- the genuine affection in the room, say, when he won his \"Good Will Hunting\" Oscar speaks to just how well-liked he was in Hollywood. And yet unlike many of his contemporaries, Williams had a particular impact on the slice of the population now in our mid-to-late 20s and early 30s. Through the 1990s, Williams, an established film star, shifted into a new gear in his career; he generously and humbly took on entertainment for kids. Williams will be remembered for his edgy comedy and for dramatic turns, but for people my age, Williams was our childhood. \n \n Williams' filmography in the 1980s and early 1990s is full of prestige projects (\"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" \"Awakenings,\" \"Dead Poets Society\"), but something shifted with \"Hook\"; the movie about Peter Pan rediscovering the joy of Neverland had the same effect, perhaps, on Williams, who'd always been wacky and loose on-screen but was suddenly acting like he'd never grown up. It took a fairly humble A-lister to play a supporting role in an animated film at a time when voice acting was an anonymous profession, and a fairly brave comic known for working blue to abandon anything that wasn't safe for young children. And yet Williams' performance as the Genie in \"Aladdin\" was straightforwardly a triumph, lending one of Disney's grimmer stories its imaginative expansiveness. Without Williams, it's impossible to imagine \"Aladdin\" becoming the VHS classic it was through the 1990s; people in my age bracket, even those who may not be able to quote chapter and verse, can easily call to mind the sense of fun and comfort Williams' voice conjured. He was generous enough to erase his recognizable face and body entirely, and yet as a blue drawing was more vivid and lifelike than the vast majority of TV characters. \n \n Again and again, Williams went to extremes in his desire to please. In \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" simply one of the best family films ever made, the actor buried his face under makeup and his body in a fat suit in order to pull off physical comedy that felt, for kids, somehow illicit. We weren't supposed to be seeing something so strangely charged, even if the moral (about parental love) was brought home safely. \n \n Certain themes emerged. In \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" Williams plays a voice actor who's too childlike to sustain his marriage to Sally Field; in \"Jumanji,\" Williams played a man who'd been trapped inside a board game since childhood and who'd never lived in the real world; in \"Jack,\" he played a boy trapped in the body of a man; in \"Flubber,\" he was a professor unable to deal with the very real pressures of running a lab and bedeviled by magical, fun green goo. It hardly needed to be made this explicit to the children in the multiplex seats or, more likely, watching on Blockbuster rental that Williams was like us. He was strangely innocent of adult-world concerns and, better yet, he was utterly unselfish about lowering himself to the level of kids. What he found funny was funny to his audience, who cared not at all about his Oscar nominations or public profile or past comedy career. \n \n As the century turned, Williams got interested, again, in serious projects, but it didn't help that the mid-budget adult drama was beginning its disappearance. He'd been out of leading-man roles in adult movies for so long that something was off his fastball -- movies like \"Jakob the Liar\" and \"Bicentennial Man\" had conceits (a man tries to spread hope among his friends with fanciful lies during the Holocaust; a robot can live forever but just wants to be human) that were two degrees removed from the sunny, high-concept optimism of kids' movies. (He'd lately, fittingly enough, rebooted his children's movie career as Theodore Roosevelt in the \"Night at the Museum\" movies.) \n \n It hardly mattered, though, to the now-early-teens who'd been raised on Williams' movies. For them -- for me -- Williams has a place in the pantheon simply by virtue of being that rare star who seemed excited to work on projects we cared about. Giving joy is as important as evoking tears or provoking thought, and Williams' legacy, perhaps, can be measured in the imprints his movies left in rec-room carpets, as kids parked in front of the TV rewound his movies again and again. ||||| Fate threw me in Robin Williams' path more than once, and I never forgot any of the encounters. He was such a wired, complex, brilliantly funny individual, no connection with him was anything like ordinary. \n \n Though Williams, who died Monday at age 63, appeared in dozens of films, getting Oscar nominated for four performances and finally winning for 1997's \"Good Will Hunting,\" it was as a dazzling, unknown stand-up comedian that I first met him. In a pair of linked meetings, he made an impression on me that in an unnerving way connects in my mind to the tragic way his life ended. \n \n The year was 1978, I was a freelance journalist newly arrived in Los Angeles when an editor I knew at Rolling Stone called me with a quick last-minute assignment. \n \n A TV show called \"Mork & Mindy\" was being filmed, and though it hadn't aired yet, the word was already out that its star, a young comedian named Robin Williams, was going to break out. \n \n In addition to filming the show, Williams was doing occasional stand-up at the Comedy Store on Sunset Boulevard. Would I catch one of his shows, do a brief interview and write a small story for the magazine? Who could say no to that? \n \n Asphyxia from an apparent suicide is what officials are initially saying is the cause of death for 63-year-old comedian Robin Williams, ahead of an official coroner's report. Asphyxia from an apparent suicide is what officials are initially saying is the cause of death for 63-year-old comedian Robin Williams, ahead of an official coroner's report. See more videos \n \n The Comedy Store was half-asleep and half-empty that night, Williams was the last performer on the bill, and did he wake the place up. The astounding routine he went into would defy description even if I could remember it word for word. \n \n He took on different characters with different accents, roamed to all kinds of locations, both physical and metaphysical, made lightning-fast comic connections in time and space that were at once hysterically funny and like nothing I had ever experienced before. It was no surprise people in the know were buzzing about Robin Williams, no surprise at all. \n \n After the show Williams and I had a quick bite in a bustling place on the Strip called the Copper Kettle. It was jammed with people, and absolutely no one cared or even looked up when he walked into the room. How are you going to handle it, I asked him, when your show airs and everyone knows your name, when you won't be able to walk into a place like this without causing a firestorm. \n \n Oh no, Williams insisted, stubbornly \u2014 or perhaps nervously, at this point I can't be sure \u2014 refusing to acknowledge the tsunami everyone around him knew was headed his way. That's not going to happen, he said, confidently shaking his head, nothing like that is ever going to happen. \n \n Cut to several months later. \"Mork & Mindy\" is the hottest show on television, and Williams is the talk of the town. I was covering the AFI Life Achievement Award for the Washington Post and, by pure chance, walked into the hotel entrance right behind Robin and his date. \n \n I tapped him on the shoulder, he turned around and gave me a big surprised grin. So, I asked him, as the line to the ballroom snaked forward, how has this celebrity business turned out for you? He was about to say something when we turned a corner and the mass phalanx of photographers caught sight of him. \n \n \"Robin, Robin, look this way, Robin, over here,\" they screamed in a \"Day of the Locust\" frenzy as waves of flashbulbs flashed in unison. Robin smiled, waved and mugged and then all of a sudden turned back to me. With the brilliant improvisational mind that defined him, he said something in a stage whisper that was immediately recognizable as a riff on the terrifying plea for help that closes the 1950s science fiction classic \"The Fly.\" \n \n \"Help me, Ken,\" he said in a perfect imitation of the film's tiny, doomed fly voice. \"Help me.\" Then he turned back to the photographers and was gone. \n \n Because it was as stand-up of genius that I first encounter Williams, that's how I always thought of him, even when he transformed into a formidable actor Oscar-nominated for \"Good Morning, Vietnam,\" \"Dead Poets Society\" and \"The Fisher King\" before his \"Good Will Hunting\" triumph. \n \n It always seemed to me that the restlessness, the search for experience and knowledge that characterized his comedy as well as his very physical presence compelled him to go into drama, to take on not only comic roles but also dark ones. Roles that in some ways seemed out of character with his stand-up voice but from another point of view fit right in. \n \n I ran into Williams one more time, several years later at a press lunch at the Cannes Film Festival where he was in full performance mode, keeping a table full of journalists roaring with laughter at the frenzied nimbleness of his attack. But even at those high-octane moments, even when he won his Oscar, I could never get that \"Help me\" moment out of my mind. When word came in Monday about his death, the thought of it made me shudder, it really did.",

A sampling: When it comes to comedy, \"there wasn't a faster brain on the planet,\" writes Tony Hicks in the Contra Costa Times. We'll be hearing \"a litany of tributes about one of the great comedians who ever lived. Much of it will be some of the same adjectives used when any great performer dies\u2014especially before their time. But in Williams' case, most of it will be true.\" Early in his career, \"it was clear that Mr. Williams was one of the most explosively, exhaustingly, prodigiously verbal comedians who ever lived,\" AO Scott writes in the New York Times. And beyond that, \"his essential persona as an entertainer combined neediness and generosity, intelligence and kindness, in ways that were charming and often unexpectedly moving.\" Williams may have gotten his start long before Aladdin, but he gave a \"generous and humble\" gift to the millennial generation, writes Daniel D'Addario at Salon. \"Williams will be remembered for his edgy comedy and for dramatic turns, but for people my age, Williams was our childhood,\" from Mrs. Doubtfire to Jumanji to Flubber. In the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan recalls a moment when, facing an onslaught of photographers, Williams asked him\u2014in the voice of a fly from a 1950s sci-fi flick\u2014to \"help me, Ken.

Oakleigh started off on 4 liters of oxygen and within 3 days she was breathing nothing but air and saturating between 98 and 100%. In the NICU, they used to call her Miss Sassy because of her ability to express her displeasure with her circumstances.Oakleigh had grown normally and her health was excellent up until a couple of months ago when she came down with a sudden fever. Out of nowhere, her fever spiked to 104. It just so happened that Oakleigh had a severe UTI that probably had invaded her kidneys.After going on antibiotics, the fever went away but returned a week later. She has battled with reoocurring infections over the latest months and was then hospitalized for further testing.The tests revealed that Oakleigh has stage 3 kidney reflux.This is rather common with this condition, but the bacteria associated with her infection was a dangerous, antibiotic resistant strain of Pseudomonas.While she was in the hospital, tests were done on her heart which revealed moderate ASD and pulmonary stenosis.This is especially concerning when you consider the infection and the involvement of the kidneys.Oakleigh is currently scheduled for surgery at the end of this month.They will be operating to fix the reflux in her left kidney, which now has 22% functionality, in hopes to eliminate future infections.This will be about a 4 \u00bd hour procedure.Her left kidney is actually 2 kidneys, with 2 different ureters which will have to be cut back to a length that will prevent reflux.She will also have to have a pocket on the outside of the kidney removed.The next step after healing from the surgery is to meet with the cardiologist to discuss additional testing for her heart condition.Oakleigh has a long road ahead of her, but God has her hand every step of the way and for that we are extreemly thankful.Oakleigh is surrounded by a loving and supportive family and on their behalf, we thank you for your support.God Bless! ||||| What is a pseudomonas infection? \n \n A pseudomonas infection is caused by a very common type of bacteria called Pseudomonas aeruginosa (say \"soo-duh-MOH-nuss ay-roo-jee-NOH-suh\"). \n \n Healthy people often carry these bacteria around without knowing it and without having any problems. Sometimes these germs cause minor problems like swimmer's ear and hot tub rash. But for people who are weak or ill, these germs can cause very serious-even deadly-infections in any part of the body. \n \n Recommended Related to Health A-Z Aspergillosis Important It is possible that the main title of the report Aspergillosis is not the name you expected. Please check the synonyms listing to find the alternate name(s) and disorder subdivision(s) covered by this report. Read the Aspergillosis article > > \n \n The infections are hard to treat because the bacteria can resist many types of antibiotics, the medicines normally used to kill bacteria. \n \n Who gets this infection? \n \n People in the hospital may get this infection. In hospitals, the bacteria can spread through medical equipment, cleaning solutions, and other equipment. They can even spread through food. When they spread to patients who are weak because of illness, surgery, or treatment, they can cause very serious infections. For example, pseudomonas is one of the main causes of pneumonia in patients who are on breathing machines. \n \n Burn victims and people with puncture wounds may get dangerous pseudomonas infections of the blood, bone, or urinary tract. The bacteria can also get into the body through IV needles or catheters. \n \n These bacteria like moist environments, such as hot tubs and swimming pools, where they can cause a skin rash or swimmer's ear. \n \n People who wear contact lenses can get serious eye infections if the bacteria get into their contact lens solutions. This can happen if you aren't careful about keeping your contact lenses and equipment sterile. \n \n What are the symptoms? \n \n Symptoms depend on where the infection is. If it's in a wound, there may be green-blue pus in or around the area. If you have swimmer's ear, your ear aches. If the infection causes pneumonia, you may get a cough. When the infections are elsewhere in the body, you may have a fever and feel tired. But all pseudomonas infections can make you very sick if they spread through the bloodstream (septicemia). A serious infection can cause symptoms of high fever, chills, confusion, and shock. ||||| OKLAHOMA CITY - An Oklahoma infant is fighting for her life inside a metro hospital. \n \n She isn\u2019t even a year old yet, but doctors say she\u2019s contracted a \u201csuper strain\u201d of E. coli. \n \n Her family doesn\u2019t know how she contracted the serious bacterial infection, and investigators with the CDC are looking into the case. \n \n Oakleigh Nance has been in and out of the hospital for months after she was born with a kidney issue. \n \n Now, her family is hoping she can fight off this disease before an upcoming kidney surgery that could save her life. \n \n Oakleigh is just 11-months-old. \n \n \u201cShe has such a great personality.

She was 35 years old but gave off the nervous pent-up sexual energy of a wallflower at prom, and with good reason: She had never kissed a man, let alone seen one nude in her Long Beach home. \n \n She had been carefree and pretty as a teenager\u2014until a car accident sent her flying through a windshield, slicing her face open and blinding her in one eye, according to Larry. Afterwards, she thought, How could anyone ever love me? So she shut herself off to the world, to romantic love and sex. Until now. \n \n It was summer 1994 and Larry, who was a decade her senior, had instructions. \"I want you to stare at me,\" he ordered softly. \"Be scared. Be curious. Be excited. If you're bored, that's good. We'll move on.\" Soon they did, and\u2014terrifying as it was\u2014she stripped down, too. Then came kissing, caressing, and, eventually, sex. \n \n Read More: Learning How to Orgasm Without Any Touching \n \n \n \n Larry Villarin, a 62-year-old Californian, is not her boyfriend. Nor is he a sex worker, although technically he gets paid $150 per hour to have sex, hang out naked, and teach his clients the joys of the erotic. Larry is America's oldest male sexual surrogate, a job in which he risks being arrested in order to help others work through sexual dysfunction during one-on-one \"sessions.\" In the past 35 years, the gig has matched him with dozens of women (and an occasional man) to achieve therapeutic goals. In the past, he says, he has worked with disabled clients, abuse survivors, and people from strict religions backgrounds, as well as with millionaires, geniuses, 40-year-old virgins, and powerful judges. Most of clients pair his hands-on therapy with trips to a psychologist in order to prepare for real-life intimacy. \n \n She needed to believe I wouldn't laugh at her or run away. It was beautiful to see her open up. \n \n Only ten men are certified to do this work in the U.S., according to the International Professional Surrogates Association (IPSA). Larry and other rare men in the field must undergo 100 hours of human sexuality studies before becoming certified by the IPSA, which connects patients with surrogates through psychiatrists. As a sexual surrogate, Larry must navigate tricky emotional turf, like what happens when a client falls in love with you, or how to gently bust through body hang-ups or deeply internalized anxieties. In the case of the 35-year-old woman who had survived a car accident, it turned out that she was mostly scared of ridicule. \"She needed to believe I wouldn't laugh at her or run away. It was beautiful to see her open up,\" he says. \n \n Most of Larry's job is far less sexy than it might seem. During their first hour-long session with him, clients unload their emotional baggage \u2014ranging from social anxiety to PTSD \u2014 and set therapy goals. No sexual touching is allowed. If all goes well, they'll move to hand stroking and a face caressing. Later, he'll try a blindfolded \"trust walk\" to get them \"out of their heads.\" \n \n His clients, who range in age from 22 to 75, usually invite Larry to their L.A. homes or come to his. Many are referred to him by a psychologist after reaching a frustrating impasse in expressing their sexuality: they can't become \"normal\" without a partner, and they can't find partner if they don't become \"normal.\" The steamy stuff comes slowly\u2014 if at all. \"You set ground rules,\" Larry says, \"It's baby steps.\" He works with some clients for weeks, others for years. Some are never ready to have full-blown sex. \n \n One of the tools Larry uses in order to help his clients open up is playing naked games. In one, he and the client stand back-to-back with their eyes closed. She opens her eyes first, then it's his turn. Eventually they go to a mirror and talk honestly about their reflections. It helps that Larry, a slow-talking old hippie type, is not at all physically threatening. \"I go first and stand in front of full-length mirror. I do an oral meditation, describing my body, tip to toe\u2014how it feels and functions\u2014totally honestly,\" he says. \"It really gets down to image. I say, 'I don't like my saggy buttocks,' or 'I broke my toe when I was 20.' I can do 30 minutes of that, just modeling openness. Then she goes.\" \n \n She had her first orgasm. She didn't believe she could ever have one. I'm getting misty about it. \n \n In addition, Larry says, physical exercises can lead to epiphanies. In one case, a 70-year-old woman had lived her whole life thinking sex was a chore; religious guilt kept her from masturbating. \"She was numb \u2014 her hips were frozen,\" Larry recalls. So he told her to stand with her legs apart. \"I said, 'Imagine a pencil coming down between your genitals and your anus. Now write your name on the floor. It required movements in her hips.\" \n \n Later that night, she took a shower and lay naked on her sheets. A breeze from an open window rolled over her body, and something shifted in her pelvis. \"That's all it took. She had her first orgasm. She didn't believe she could ever have one. I'm getting misty about it,\" Larry says. \"It's just: growth \u2014 what humans are capable of. Gosh, it's intimate stuff.\" \n \n Larry claims that birthdays are the number-one reason women come to see him. Late-in-life virgins, turning 30 or 40, see the date looming and want to take the plunge. \"Milestones are a big one. It's anxiety provoking. Women will say, 'This my final hope,'\" Larry says. \n \n Usually, those clients have control problems sparked by something early in life. If they don't address their issues with control, they tend to get worse, and their virginity becomes a symbol of everything wrong with them. \"They're embarrassed. Sometimes they can't talk to anyone about it,\" Larry notes. \"They try to fake it with girlfriends. But every new man has to be Mr. Right\u2014perfect\u2014so they run away at the first relationship glitch. The longer they wait, the more the anxiety builds.\" \n \n [Birthdays] are a big one. It's anxiety provoking. Women will say, 'This my final hope.' \n \n Emotional blocks can turn physical for some women. One client suffered from a condition called vaginismus, which caused her vaginal canal to tighten involuntarily, preventing sex. It was painful and embarrassing, so Larry recommended she use vaginal dilators for six months. Unlike a gynecologist, however, he paired that treatment with intimacy therapy and physical touch. It worked, he claims. \n \n Larry is a sort of a gateway guy, he says: He's low risk because he's not a real lover. \"The women are not there to please me; I'm there for them. Somewhere along the line, they stopped trusting men. I have to undo that.\" \n \n Although trust is deeply important to Larry's work, it's also important to keep an emotional distance. Larry says that some of his clients have fallen in love with him, which can push him into a tricky emotional and ethical gray area. \n \n One woman came to him, fresh out of an abusive marriage, on the heels of her son's death. She was sick of being alone and wanted to enjoy sex. \"We worked for two years. We had so many firsts together\u2014she didn't want to let go,\" Larry recalls. When her sessions came to an end, Larry says, the client began sending him expensive gifts and kept trying to see him. \"I kind of knew she was in love with me. But I had to be ethical.\" \n \n Not long after that, he set up new boundaries: He stopped allowing sessions in his own bedroom and built a \"therapy room\" instead. After one of his own romantic relationships \"fell apart because of the job,\" he took a break from it. Now, he sometimes holds back sharing with clients because, \"by telling [a client] too much about myself, I realized, I am burdening her.\" \n \n The job is full of ethical landmines, according to Paula Hall, a British sex therapist. \"In the UK, the practice is mostly frowned upon,\" she says. The surrogate-client relationship is often seen as just too complicated, she adds. To Larry, however, the lines are clear enough. \"In a sense, we already know the relationship has to end. It's better that they learn how to be hurt with me, rather than a less sensitive man.\" \n \n Romantic feelings aren't the only issue complicating Larry's profession: Paying for sex \u2014 any sex \u2014is illegal in the U.S., and there's no law offering surrogates special protection. If a cop were to bust in on Larry during a session, he could be arrested, which is exactly what happened to one of his female surrogate friends. \"She was seeing a client and he turned out to be a cop,\" Larry says. \"He said, 'I have to confess: In 10 minutes you're going to hear a knock on the door, and you're going to be busted for prostitution, but I can see that's not what this is.\" \n \n IPSA skirts prostitution law in certifying its members because it doesn't acknowledge intercourse is part of the practice, according to Larry and other current and former surrogates. Today, he's baffled that people don't understand the difference between his work, which he sees as primarily therapeutic or socially instructive. \n \n For instance, Larry once worked with a woman from a strict religious background. Because of her upbringing, she had learned to see kissing as strictly a sexual act, never used for casual affection. She enlisted Larry to teach her the basics of kissing in all different contexts. In their sessions, Larry says, she made the rules. \"We tried all of them: A quick kiss goodbye, a hello kiss, a marathon make out. I was never allowed to kiss back,\" he recounts. After a few weeks, she left feeling \"reborn,\" ready for lovers and friends. \"It did increase her confidence, oh my,\" Larry says. \n \n But most of the time, Larry never gets to see the positive affects of his work. \"The empowerment part comes when they leave me. It's like karate: Once you get your black belt, your training has just begun. With me, they've opened their hearts \u2014 and now they can go have a life.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It is one of the most unusual, and rarest, jobs in the country: Larry Villarin is a certified male sex surrogate, one of only 10 in the US sanctioned by the International Professional Surrogates Association. But as a profile at Broadly makes clear, the 62-year-old Villarin is not to be confused with a male gigolo. His role is to help clients \"cope with their fears and anxieties about physical intimacy,\" writes Natalie O'Neill, and sex is just one component of that. The story uses the example of a 35-year-old woman who had shied away from intimacy her entire adult life because a car accident as a teenager left her blind in one eye. She'd never even been kissed until her sessions with Villarin. \"She needed to believe I wouldn't laugh at her or run away,\" he says. \"It was beautiful to see her open up.\" On its website, IPSA says \"it is committed to promoting healthy attitudes toward sexuality and intimacy in our clients and in the community,\" and the story explains that it gets around prostitution laws \"because it doesn't acknowledge intercourse is part of the practice.\" Villarin says his clients range in age from 22 to 75, with milestone birthdays seemingly one of the big triggers. Most are referred to him from a psychologist, with survivors of abuse and women with disabilities among those reaching out. One of the tricky parts is setting boundaries so the clients don't confuse the physical intimacy with romantic feelings for Villarin. \"It's just growth\u2014what humans are capable of,\" he says. \"Gosh, it's intimate stuff.\" Click for the full story.
