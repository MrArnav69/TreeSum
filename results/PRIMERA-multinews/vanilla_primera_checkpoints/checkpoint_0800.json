    "document": "While higher doses of psychedelic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin cause trippy visual hallucinations, lower doses may not cause the same impairments, anecdotal reports suggest. \n \n Editor's Note: This article was updated at 5:15 p.m. E.T. \n \n For Martijn Schirp, it's a way to make an ordinary day just a little bit better. \n \n A former poker player and recent graduate in interdisciplinary science in Amsterdam, Schirp has been experimenting with a new way to take psychedelic drugs: Called microdosing, it involves routinely taking a small fraction of a normal dose of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or magic mushrooms (the latter is legal to purchase in coffeeshops in Amsterdam but not the former). \n \n Microdosing has gained a cult following amongst a small group of hallucinogen enthusiasts like Schirp, who now writes at HighExistence.com. Proponents report improvements in perception, mood and focus, minus the trippy tangerine trees and marmalade skies normally associated with psychedelics. \n \n Schirp said he prefers to microdose when he's immersed in creative or contemplative activities, such as writing, painting, meditating or doing yoga. \n \n \"It's like the coffee to wake up the mind-body connection. When I notice it is working, depending on the dosage, time seems to be slowing down a bit, everything seems covered with a layer of extra significance,\" Schirp told Live Science in an email. \n \n Given his positive experiences with higher doses of psychedelics, \"microdosing offered a way to get a taste of this without [the experience] completely overwhelming me,\" Schirp said. [Trippy Tales: The History of 8 Hallucinogens] \n \n But while the effects Schirp and others describe are plausible from a physiological perspective, microdosing is uncharted territory, said Matt Johnson, a psychologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, who has studied the behavioral effects of psychedelic drugs. Scientists have yet to run a clinical trial to assess the effects (or lack thereof) of microdosing. Johnson added that taking a smaller dose of a psychedelic is safer than taking a large dose, but the way people tend to do it \u2014 regularly taking small doses every several days \u2014 could have long-term side effects. \n \n Just a little bit \n \n The idea of taking small doses of psychedelics has been around for a while. The inventor of LSD, Albert Hofmann, was known to microdose in his old age and told a friend that microdosing was an under-researched area. But microdosing gained greater visibility when James Fadiman, a psychologist and researcher at Sofia University in Palo Alto, California, described it in his book \"The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide\" (Park Street Press, 2011). \n \n Since then, Fadiman has received about 50 anecdotal reports from microdosers around the world. Most report positive, barely perceptible shifts while microdosing, Fadiman said. [Images: Scientists Analyze Drawings by an Acid-Tripping Artist] \n \n \"What people say is that whatever they're doing, they seem to be doing it a little better,\" Fadiman told Live Science. \"They're a little kinder, a little bit nicer with their kids.\" \n \n People with creative jobs report improved focus and an ability to enter the state of flow more easily. Some report a desire to eat healthier or start meditating, Fadiman said. \n \n \"It's like they tend to live a little better,\" Fadiman said. \n \n Still others report taking the teeny doses of psychedelics for psychiatric conditions, said Brad Burge, the director of marketing and communications at Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies in Santa Cruz, California, where scientists study the effect of psychedelics on medical conditions such as PTSD. \n \n \"I've heard anecdotally of people using it for depression, seasonal affective disorder, anxiety, OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder],\" Burge told Live Science. \"With microdoses, the point would be to create subtle changes in people's psychopharmacology or experience, in much the same way as most traditional pharmaceuticals are used now.\" \n \n Plausible mechanism, no evidence \n \n The effects people report with microdoses of LSD, psilocybin, DMT or other \"classic\" psychedelics aren't completely implausible, Johnson said. All of these drugs work by activating a particular receptor in the brain known as the serotonin 5HT-2A receptor. This receptor fuels the release of the \"feel-good\" brain chemical, serotonin, which creates a domino effect in the brain that leads to many other brain changes. \n \n At high doses, these drugs temporarily, but radically, reshape brain networks; for instance, one study found that magic mushrooms create a hyperconnected brain. But antidepressants like Prozac also target serotonin receptors, so it's possible that a low, constant dose of a psychedelic might work in a similar manner, Johnson said. [11 Odd Facts About Magic Mushrooms] \n \n Still, there's absolutely no evidence to suggest microdosing works as people claim it does, Johnson said. The effects described are so subtle \u2014 on par with having the caffeine in a cup of coffee \u2014 that they \"fall within that category of barely perceptible, and it's right in the range where people can so easily fool themselves,\" Johnson told Live Science. That means microdosing is particularly susceptible to the placebo effect, in which people taking a sugar pill who believe they're taking a drug report perceptible effects, he said. \n \n To prove that microdosing has an effect, psychedelics researchers would need to do a double-blind study, in which neither the people administering the drug nor the recipients know whether a particular participant is getting a microdose of a psychedelic or something inert, like a little sugar dissolved in water, Johnson said. Some groups of people are allegedly doing these trials \u2014 but because LSD is illegal, and is only approved for research use in a few small trials in a few locations, all of these people are off the grid and not publicizing their efforts, Fadiman said. \n \n Unknown side effects \n \n What's more, microdosing could have side effects, Johnson said. The few microscopic grains of LSD \u2014 just 10 micrograms \u2014 typically used to microdose are too tiny to measure even on a professional laboratory scale, Johnson said. To get around this, people who microdose typically take a blotter paper laced with one hit of LSD, soak it in water and then drink some of the water. But since LSD is an illegal substance procured on the black market, there's really no way to know exactly what you're getting, Johnson said. \n \n Even in the lab, with carefully measured doses of drugs administered in a controlled environment, Johnson has found substantial variation in the way that people react to the same dose. Combined, those two uncertainties mean people may not be able to reliably microdose, he said. \n \n \"Someone might be expecting a kind of sparkly day, just a really productive day at work \u2014 and next thing you know, they're grasping hold to their office chair wondering why the world is dissolving,\" Johnson said. \n \n Schirp, for instance, has occasionally had negative microdosing experiences. \n \n \"At times, the experience was still too overwhelming to be productive \u2014 I just wanted to lay down or take a walk,\" Schirp said. \n \n Beyond that possible experience, the long-term risks of the drug are unknown. The risk of taking a single, tiny dose of LSD or psilocybin is going to be smaller than the risk of taking one big hit, Johnson said. But even the most dedicated psychonauts don't typically trip daily or even weekly, Johnson said. By contrast, people who are microdosing report using the drugs every three or four days, he said. \n \n Such frequent use could have unknown, long-term side effects, he said. \n \n \"You're tinkering with the system that is involved with depressive systems, but in unexplored ways,\" Johnson said. \n \n Editor's Note: This article was updated to correct the spelling of Martijn Schirp's name. \n \n Follow Tia Ghose on Twitterand Google+.

[Trippy Tales: The History of 8 Hallucinogens] \n \n Nutt and his colleagues focused on three classes of drugs restricted by national laws and international conventions: cannabis (marijuana), MDMA (ecstasy) and psychedelics. Three United Nations treaties from 1961, 1971 and 1988 put a legal system in place for controlling the use of these psychoactive drugs, both for recreational or research purposes. \n \n Prior to these restrictions, studies investigating these drugs had demonstrated important therapeutic uses, the authors argue. Marijuana has long been used medicinally and can be used to relieve pain and muscle spasms in people with AIDS and multiple sclerosis, for example. Ecstasy has been found to help treat post-traumatic stress disorder and help couples improve communication in their relationships. And LSD, or acid, has been used to treat alcoholism, Nutt said. \n \n Aside from medicinal uses, Nutt and colleagues say psychedelic drugs can play a role in probing the nature of consciousness, because they induce changes in the conscious state. The drugs activate a receptor in the brain called 5HT-2A, which is most prevalent in the brain's outer layer, or cortex, in areas involved in sensation and emotion. \n \n \"We cannot understand the brain if we're not studying drugs,\" Nutt said. \n \n The restrictions were designed to protect against the drugs' perceived dangers, but these dangers are overstated, and are often less severe than those from alcohol, Nutt and his colleagues write. The regulations make it almost impossible to conduct the research necessary to challenge these perceptions, Nutt said. \n \n Because of the illegal status of these drugs, finding funding to study them can be very challenging. What's more, the drugs are not easy to obtain \u2014 standard chemical manufacturers don't produce them, and the cost for custom synthesis is prohibitively high. For example, the researchers, in their paper, cite a company in Boston that produces psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, at a cost of $12,000 per gram (0.04 oz). \n \n Nutt is one of the few scientists doing research on these psychedelic drugs, and his findings have \"opened up a whole new way of how the brain works,\" he said. \n \n From a scientific standpoint, research on psychedelic drugs was deemed important before the drugs were banned in the early 1960s. Robert F. Kennedy once questioned the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), saying, \"if [clinical LSD projects] were worthwhile six months ago, why aren't they worthwhile now?\" Still, the bans went ahead. \n \n The restrictions aren't absolute, however. Seventeen U.S. states have legalized marijuana for medicinal use, and in Colorado and Washington, marijuana is now legal for personal use. Still, researchers face many hurdles in obtaining and working with marijuana and other drugs. \n \n \"It's time for scientists to stand up and change things,\" Nutt said. \n \n Follow Tanya Lewis on Twitterand Google+.

This was during a period where drug use rose among young, middle-class Americans. The link between crime and drug use became apparent, and a war on drugs ensued. But now a bit of research is finally beginning to surface, highlighting the drug\u2019s benefits, such as treatment for anxiety, treatment for addiction, and an increase in creative thinking. With more research and, as the video states, \u201can open mind,\u201d the substance can make a comeback to people across the world. \n \n The National Survey on Drug Use and Health reports that more than 1.1 million people, aged 12 or older, have tried hallucinogens at least once in their lifetime. \n \n The psychedelic drug was first synthesized and ingested by Albert Hoffman in 1938 from ergot, a grain fungus that grows on rye. LSD can also be synthesized from common garden flowers like Morning Glory and Hawaiian Baby Woodrose. The seeds contain over 10 different types of ergoline alkaloids, most notably ergine, which is also called LSA (d-lysergic acid amide). LSD works by mimicking serotonin in the brain, and takes priority over any bodily serotonin sending messages to the body. This process is why scientists believe that people see hallucinations when on the drug. \n \n That being said, since LSD is non-toxic, no one has ever gotten close to the amount where the drug could be lethal. There are reports of people using over 400 doses of LSD and surviving. Aside from that, our bodies grow incredibly tolerant to the drug. According to the video, if you were to take the same dose of the drug three days in a row, the third day that dosage would have little to no effect. What makes LSD the most dangerous is by buying the substance on the street, where it has been mixed with other dangerous substances. Many famous people like Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, and Francis Crick, the man who discovered the DNA helix, credit their success to LSD. \n \n \"Something tells me there is a treasure trove of knowledge to be gained by this substance, but only time will tell,\" PsychedSubstance says in the video. ||||| Context: In his amazing book Zero to One: Notes on Startups, Peter Thiel mentions that he *always* asks this question in job interviews. \n \n I think it\u2019s a great question and am curious to hear anyone and everyone\u2019s answers. : ]",

It's been around for years, too: LSD inventor Albert Hofmann microdosed in his old age, and the practice is described in James Fadiman's 2011 book The Psychedelic Explorer's Guide. Yet even Schirp admits it's not always positive: \"At times, the experience was still too overwhelming to be productive\u2014I just wanted to lay down or take a walk,\" he says.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n By Jason Abbruzzese \n \n Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director, will be joining Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox as chief communications officer, the company announced Monday. \n \n Hicks becomes the latest in a long line of people who have moved between Fox and the White House. In June, former Fox News president Bill Shine took Hicks' former role with the Trump administration after her resignation in February. \n \n Fox is in the midst of a major pivot, having sold off most of its entertainment assets to Disney in July for $71.3 billion. The company is now refocusing on its Fox broadcast network, Fox News and other news- and sports-heavy cable channels \u2014 which has come to be known in media circles as \"New Fox.\" \n \n Fox also announced on Monday that Danny O'Brien has been hired to serve as head of government relations. O'Brien had most recently worked as government relations leader for General Electric's transportation operation. \n \n Sarah Sanders, White House press secretary, tweeted a message of congratulations to Hicks. \n \n \"FOX won\u2019t find anyone smarter or more talented than Hope Hicks,\" Sanders wrote. \n \n Hicks adds to the already close relationship between the Trump administration and Murdoch's media assets. President Donald Trump and Murdoch are known to be friendly, with The New York Times reporting in December that the two talked on the phone weekly. \n \n Hicks served as press secretary on Trump's 2016 campaign, having previously worked for the Trump Organization and Ivanka Trump's fashion label. \n \n Fox noted in its press release that Hicks will not start until the close of the Disney deal, at which time 21st Century Fox will also change its name to Fox. Fox said Hicks will be based in Los Angeles. \n \n Though she left the White House in February, Hicks was spotted on Air Force One in August. \n \n While it has become common in recent years for former White House staff to join media organizations, the addition of Hicks to Fox further ties the company's cable news operation to Trump. Trump's staff now includes national security adviser John Bolton, who had been a Fox News contributor; State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert, a former Fox News anchor; and White House communications adviser Mercedes Schlapp, who had also been a Fox News contributor, among others. \n \n Trump has made no secret of his affinity for Fox News, which features an evening roster of hosts that ardently back the president. In September, Trump sent eight tweets praising or pointing to Fox News coverage, with his most recent urging people to tune into the channel to watch a rally in West Virginia. ||||| But Disney is not buying Fox News, Fox Sports or the company's broadcast network or TV stations. So those assets will be spun off to form a slimmed-down version of Fox, officially named, you guessed it, FOX. \n \n Last week, the company announced the new all-caps name and confirmed that Lachlan Murdoch will be the CEO while his father Rupert Murdoch will be the co-chairman. \n \n Monday's hiring of Hicks is part of the executive transition. Her role will take effect when the spin-off is in place. \n \n The current PR chief at 21st Century Fox, Julie Henderson, is leaving when the deal is done, along with several other executives. \n \n Hicks will be moving to Los Angeles for the FOX role. She will report to Viet Dinh, FOX's chief legal and policy officer. Dinh, in turn, reports to Lachlan Murdoch. \n \n Hicks will work at the C-suite level. Fox News, based in New York, has its own PR operation. But Fox News -- with its highly-rated pro-Trump talk shows -- is one of the main assets of FOX. \n \n Hicks previously worked in New York for Donald Trump's presidential campaign, then moved to Washington at the start of the Trump presidency. Before she resigned in February, she was one of the president's longest-serving aides. \n \n Ever since then, there's been speculation that she would take a job in the corporate world, mixed with the occasional rumor about a return to the Trump White House. \n \n Hicks was spotted boarding Air Force One back in August, but has otherwise kept a low profile in her eight months since leaving the White House. \n \n Hicks' hiring stirred intrigue because President Trump and Rupert Murdoch have a complicated and mutually beneficial relationship. The two men are known to speak regularly. And Fox News is a key part of Trump's media machine. \n \n It's unknown if any of that factored into Hicks' decision. \n \n She declined to comment when the announcement was made on Monday. \n \n FOX also announced the hiring of Danny O'Brien, an executive at GE, to be the head of government relations. \n \n While Hicks has connections to Trump, O'Brien has roots in Democratic politics as a former chief of staff to several Democratic senators.",

    "document": "(Reuters) - It's the biggest parlor game on Wall Street: Estimating how large JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) trading loss will be from a hedging strategy that went wrong. \n \n The biggest U.S. bank by assets has already disclosed $2 billion of paper losses, and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said it could lose another $1 billion or more. \n \n The losses will grow, some traders say, because it appears JPMorgan has only sold a small portion of its position, leaving it vulnerable to price swings in a thinly traded market. Others are not so sure the bank will suffer much more than it already has. Dimon said the bank won't rashly sell, and any additional losses could arise throughout the year. A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined comment. \n \n The source of JPMorgan's problems is an obscure group of indexes that track the performance of corporate bonds. One of the indexes, the Markit CDX NA IG Series 9 maturing in 2017, is essentially a portfolio of credit default swaps - basically contracts that protect against default by a borrower. \n \n This particular index is tied to the credit quality of 121 North American investment-grade bond issuers, including such names as Kraft Foods KFT.N and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT.N). \n \n JPMorgan used that index, and others, to bet that credit markets would strengthen. Because that position is widely known on Wall Street, many traders are betting the opposite way in the hope of profiting as the bank's losses increase. The index has been moving against JPMorgan in recent days. \n \n Oppenheimer & Co used the average of the index in 2011 - 141 - to estimate on a straight line basis a theoretical additional loss for the bank of $5.9 billion. Oppenheimer analysts, however, cautioned that such a large loss was unlikely. \"We think the number will be less\" than a $5 billion estimate, they said. \n \n For starters, they said, JPMorgan likely offset the trading position before announcing the loss. Their analysis also reflects a trade in a vacuum without any counter-bets. Additionally, credit quality has been improving so \"the underlying market has moved in JPM's favor,\" they said. \n \n Some analysts are frustrated at how difficult it is to determine the source of the bank's losses. \"I've been through this exercise a few times, and I can't make the numbers make sense,\" said Michael Johnson, chief market strategist at brokerage M.S. Howells, who helped put together earlier versions of the credit derivatives index. \n \n The Markit CDX NA IG 9 index maturing in 2017 stood at 128 on May 10, just before Dimon announced the losses, up from 112 at end-March, according to Markit. Higher values for the index indicate the market sees credit quality as having deteriorated, which hurts JPMorgan. On May 11, the index jumped to 139, and on Wednesday, it traded near 150. \n \n Without knowing the specific details of JPMorgan's trades, precise figures for the bank's losses are hard to determine. The total size of JPMorgan's bets and the dates and prices it paid to place the bets are not known. It's also not known what trades the bank has made to counteract the losses. \n \n What's more, the current higher value of the index may entice hedge funds and other investors to sell credit protection on the index, which amounts to buying exposure to the portfolio of credits. If that happens it could help JPMorgan by moving the index level lower. \n \n WHALE SPOTTING \n \n JPMorgan's trades are based on credit derivative indexes conceived by JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) a decade ago to allow banks, hedge funds and corporate treasury departments to buy and sell insurance against the risk that corporate bonds they own might default. \n \n JPMorgan sold credit insurance on the CDX index maturing in 2017 as a way of gaining exposure to the portfolio of credits, according to traders. On its own, that position would perform well if credit quality improves or stays more or less the same. \n \n The traders don't know JPMorgan's precise trading positions but believe they can at least partially identify them given that the index is traded relatively infrequently and given the size of JPMorgan's presence in it. JPMorgan was such a significant player in the CDX NA IG 9 index that one of its traders, Bruno Iksil, was dubbed the \"London whale\" in the markets. \n \n \"When someone is that big in the market, anonymity really goes out the window,\" a New York-based debt trader said. \n \n The bank is believed to have had offsetting bets to the same index maturing at the end of this year. Put together properly, the combination of selling default protection on the 2017 index and buying protection on the 2012 index would protect the bank against massive weakening in the credit market. \n \n In addition, the bank is also believed to have made bets that a high-yield index would rise - that is, that high-yield debt would deteriorate - and an investment-grade index would fall or stay stable, traders said. This trade is also widely believed to have generated losses, according to the traders, though again they can't say with any certainty. \n \n A key job for the bank's Chief Investment Office - which oversaw the index trading - was to hedge the bank against risks of default. As one of the world's biggest lenders, JPMorgan has hundreds of billions of dollars of exposure to credit, so it makes sense for the bank to hedge against the credit market doing poorly. The bank's hedge position is believed to have been crafted to generate few changes in value if the credit markets barely budged. \n \n INCREASINGLY COSTLY \n \n Over time, though, keeping the trade as a bet on the market turning down would have become prohibitively expensive, because as the 2012 index got closer to expiration it would offer less of a hedge against movements in the 2017 position. If the bank wanted to keep the trade hedged effectively it would have had to buy more and more of the 2012 credit default protection. \n \n So, by January, JPMorgan faced a decision, according to credit derivatives traders: either reduce the size of its overall trade, or allow it to turn into more of an outright bet on credit markets improving. \n \n JPMorgan opted to allow its protection against disaster to turn into a bet on markets improving, traders said. \n \n There may have been merit to that decision initially. \n \n In January, investors began to have a more optimistic view of the global economy, thanks in part to the European Central Bank's decision in December to give European banks cheap access to 489 billion euros ($623 billion) of financing. The ECB followed in February with another 529 billion euros of funding. \n \n For a time that flood of money eased investor concern about the European debt crisis - and bolstered the view that corporations would be able to pay off their debt. Signs of strength in the U.S. economy and job market helped, too. \n \n The corporate credit index began falling, a sign of credit fears abating. In October, the index hit 182, meaning it cost $182,000 to insure against $10 million of default through December 2017. By January, the index had fallen to as low as 121. In late March, the index hit 106. Those declines likely translated to healthy gains in the first quarter. \n \n But in April and May, the indexes began rising as investors grew concerned about the durability of a recovery. The weakening credit market likely resulted in increasing losses for JPMorgan. \n \n Matters worsened for the bank as hedge funds began betting against JPMorgan. That pushed up the index, giving the bank more losses. In the first nine days of May, the index climbed. On the 10th day, the bank stunned markets by announcing it had racked up more than $2 billion in losses. \n \n ($1 = 0.7849 euros) \n \n (By Dan Wilchins and Carrick Mollenkamp in New York; Editing By Alwyn Scott, Martin Howell and Ian Geoghegan) ||||| Simon Dawson/Bloomberg News \n \n The trading losses suffered by JPMorgan Chase have surged in recent days, surpassing the bank\u2019s initial $2 billion estimate by at least $1 billion, according to people with knowledge of the losses. \n \n When Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan\u2019s chief executive, announced the losses last Thursday, he indicated they could double within the next few quarters. But that process has been compressed into four trading days as hedge funds and other investors take advantage of JPMorgan\u2019s distress, fueling faster deterioration in the underlying credit market positions held by the bank. \n \n A spokeswoman for the bank declined to comment, although Mr. Dimon has said the total paper trading losses will be volatile depending on day-to-day market fluctuations. \n \n Related Links Graphic: A Complex Strategy That Backfired \n \n The Federal Reserve is examining the scope of the growing losses and the original bet, along with whether JPMorgan\u2019s chief investment office took risks that were inappropriate for a federally insured depository institution, according to several people with knowledge of the examination. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is still under way. \n \n The overall health of the bank remains strong, even with the additional losses, and JPMorgan has been able to increase its stock dividend faster than its rivals because of stronger earnings and a more solid capital buffer. \n \n Still, the huge trading losses rocked Wall Street and reignited the debate over how tightly giant financial institutions should be regulated. Bank analysts say that while the bank\u2019s stability is not threatened, if the losses continue to mount, the outlook for the bank\u2019s dividend will grow uncertain. \n \n The bank\u2019s leadership has discussed the impact of the losses on future earnings, although a dividend cut remains highly unlikely for now. In March, the company raised the quarterly dividend by 5 cents, to 30 cents, which will cost the bank about $190 million more this quarter. \n \n A spokeswoman for the bank said a dividend cut has not been discussed internally. \n \n At the bank\u2019s annual meeting in Tampa, Fla., on Tuesday, Mr. Dimon did not definitively rule out cutting the dividend, although he said that he \u201choped\u201d it would not be cut. \n \n John Lackey, a shareholder from Richmond, Va., who attended the meeting precisely to ask about the dividend, was not reassured. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a very clear answer,\u201d he said of Mr. Dimon\u2019s response. \u201cI expect that shareholders are going to suffer because of this.\u201d \n \n Analysts expect the bank to earn $4 billion in the second quarter, factoring in the original estimated loss of $2 billion. Even if the additional trading losses were to double, the bank could still earn a profit of $2 billion. \n \n And many analysts and investors remain optimistic about the bank\u2019s long-term prospects. \n \n Glenn Schorr, a widely followed analyst with Nomura, reiterated on Wednesday his buy rating on JPMorgan shares, which are down more than 10 percent since the trading loss became public last week. \n \n What\u2019s more, the chief investment office earned more than $5 billion in the last three years, which leaves it ahead over all, even given the added red ink. \n \n But the underlying problem is that while these sharp swings are expected at a big hedge fund, they should not be occurring at a bank whose deposits are government-backed and which has access to ultralow cost capital from the Federal Reserve, experts said. \n \n \u201cJPMorgan Chase has a big hedge fund inside a commercial bank,\u201d said Mark Williams, a professor of finance at Boston University, who also served as a Federal Reserve bank examiner. \u201cThey should be taking in deposits and making loans, not taking large speculative bets.\u201d \n \n Not long after Mr. Dimon\u2019s announcement of a dividend increase in March, the notorious bet by JPMorgan\u2019s chief investment office began to fall apart. \n \n Traders at the unit\u2019s London desk and elsewhere are now frantically trying to defuse the huge bet that was built up over years, but started generating erratic returns in late March. After a brief pause, the losses began to mount again in late April, prompting Mr. Dimon\u2019s announcement on May 10. \n \n Beginning on Friday, the same trends that had been causing the losses for six weeks accelerated, since traders on the opposite side of the bet knew the bank was under pressure to unwind the losing trade and could not double down in any way. \n \n Another issue is that the trader who executed the complex wager, Bruno Iksil, is no longer on the trading desk. Nicknamed the London Whale, Mr. Iksil had a firm grasp on the trade \u2014 knowledge that is hard to replace, even though his anticipated departure is seen as sign of the bank\u2019s taking responsibility for the debacle. \n \n \u201cThey were caught short,\u201d said one experienced credit trader who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the situation is still fluid. The market player, who does not stand to gain from JPMorgan\u2019s losses and is not involved in the trade, added, \u201cthis is a very hard trade to get out of because it\u2019s so big.\u201d \n \n He estimated that the initial loss of just over $2 billion was caused by a move of a quarter percentage point, or 25 basis points, on a portfolio with a notional value of $150 billion to $200 billion \u2014 in other words, the total value of the contracts traded, not JPMorgan\u2019s exposure. In the four trading days since Mr. Dimon\u2019s disclosure, the market has moved at least 15 to 20 basis points more against JPMorgan, he said. \n \n The overall losses are not directly proportional to the move in basis points because of the complexity of the trade. Many of the positions are highly illiquid, making them difficult to value for regulators and the bank itself. \n \n In its simplest form, traders said, the complex position assembled by the bank included a bullish bet on an index of investment-grade corporate debt, later paired with a bearish bet on high-yield securities, achieved by selling insurance contracts known as credit-default swaps. \n \n A big move in the interest rate spread between the investment grade securities and risk-free government bonds in recent months hurt the first part of the bet, and was not offset by equally large moves in the price of the insurance on the high yield bonds. \n \n As the credit yield curve steepened, the losses piled up on the corporate grade index, overwhelming gains elsewhere on the trades. Making matters worse, there was a mismatch between the expiration of different instruments within the trade, increasing losses. \n \n The additional losses represent a worsening of what is already the most embarrassing misstep for JPMorgan since Mr. Dimon became chief executive in 2005. No one has blamed Mr. Dimon for the trade, which was under the oversight of the head of the chief investment office, Ina Drew, but he has repeatedly apologized, calling it \u201cstupid\u201d and \u201csloppy.\u201d \n \n Ms. Drew resigned Monday and more departures are anticipated.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 JPMorgan's $2 billion trading loss has become a $3 billion-and-counting loss with dizzying speed, insiders tell the New York Times. CEO Jamie Dimon predicted that the loss could double within a few quarters, but the extra billion in trading losses has come in just four trading days as hedge funds and other investors smell blood and bet against the positions the bank is believed to have held to hedge against defaults. JPMorgan's \"London whale\" trader was such a big player on the obscure indexes at the heart of the bank's problems that other traders are finding it easy to identify his trading positions, Reuters notes. \"When someone is that big in the market, anonymity really goes out the window,\" notes a debt trader. The Justice Department and Federal Reserve are probing the losses, which experts say should never have been allowed to happen at a bank with government-backed deposits. But JPMorgan remains relatively healthy, despite the losses. The $3 billion loss would need to double to wipe out its profit from the second quarter of this year.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 When it comes to the first quarter of this year, one thing is clear: Things aren't looking good for the likes of JPMorgan Chase. The bank has lost $5.9 billion in market capitalization since the start of the year, according to the New York Times. And that's on top of the $1.2 billion it lost in Q1. The paper reports that JPMorgan Chase's share price has fallen more than 10% in the wake of the paper's report. The reason for the drop is unclear, but it may have something to do with the company's new CEO, Jamie Dimon. According to the Times, Dimon has been in charge of the bank's day-to-day operations since the beginning of last year. It's not clear whether he will remain in that position in the near future. In fact, it's unclear if he will even be able to return to the bank when the year is up. In the meantime, the paper reports, things are looking worse for JPMorgan Chase, which has seen its share of market cap fall more than 20% since the paper published its report. In addition, the company has lost more than $100 million in market cap over the past three years, the Times reports. The newspaper reports that the company is facing a lawsuit from the SEC, which accuses it of violating a federal anti-money laundering law by failing to disclose hundreds of millions of dollars in assets, including hundreds of thousands of bank accounts.",

    "document": "Showing a new conciliatory tone, Senate leaders opened congressional business Thursday by suggesting that a bipartisan compromise might come soon on a spending measure to keep the government running past Friday and a bill to extend a one-year cut in the payroll tax rate paid by 160 million workers. \n \n Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who has been holding up a $1 trillion spending measure that would fund much of the government through next September, said he believes both issues can be resolved \u201cin the next few days.\u201d \n \n Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) likewise said that he and Reid have been in talks about how to move forward and that he is \u201cconfident and optimistic\u201d about an agreement. \n \n The government would face a partial shutdown at midnight Friday unless Congress resolves its latest spending battle. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve done enough back and forth \u2014 the Republican leader and me staking out our positions, and our positions are fairly clear to the American people,\u201d Reid said on the Senate floor. \u201cWhat we\u2019re going to try to do during the next few hours is work toward resolving some of the outstanding issues.\u201d \n \n Speaking Thursday at the White House, President Obama said Congress must solve the payroll tax issue and get a funding bill in place before adjourning for the holidays. \n \n But he did not address whether a compromise is emerging or whether he has withdrawn objections to the pending spending measure. \n \n \u201cCongress cannot and should not go on vacation before they have made sure that working families aren\u2019t seeing their taxes go up by $1,000 and those who are out there looking for work don\u2019t see their unemployment insurance expire,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason the government should shut down over this, and I expect all of us to do what\u2019s necessary in order to do the people\u2019s business and make sure it\u2019s done before the end of the year.\u201d \n \n Overnight, House leaders advanced a spending bill that had been negotiated by Republicans and Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee. Democratic leaders have kept the measure from moving forward after the White House expressed lingering concerns with some of the bill\u2019s provisions and said it wanted Congress to agree to extend the tax cut first. \n \n By filing the bill, the House indicated it would push ahead with the measure even without Democratic support. \n \n Reid said Thursday that such House action would be a mistake. But he called the remaining Democratic concerns with the spending measure \u201cresolvable\u201d and \u201csmall in number\u201d and said Congress is getting closer to a deal. \n \n The Senate leaders\u2019 apparent optimism comes after negotiations over how to extend the tax holiday and avoid a government shutdown ground to a halt Wednesday. \n \n With a Friday deadline fast approaching, the threat of a shutdown grew more urgent. Cabinet secretaries for the first time formally alerted affected federal workers to the possibility of a shutdown \u2014 indicating in an \u00ade-mail that they would determine which staffers are \u201cessential\u201d to maintain operations in the event of a funding block. \n \n Senate Democratic leaders met with Obama on Wednesday at the White House to weigh whether to drop their demand that the $120 billion payroll tax cut be paid for with a new surtax on millionaires. Republicans have rejected the idea, but it was not clear Wednesday whether a concession from Democrats would be enough to produce a deal. \n \n Many Republicans express deep skepticism that extending the payroll tax cut would spark economic growth, as the president and Democrats have argued. \n \n On Wednesday, Senate Republicans also blocked Democratic efforts to vote on a payroll tax bill approved Tuesday by the GOP-led House. The bill would link the tax extension to a series of Republican initiatives that include speeding up the construction of an oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf Coast. Obama opposes tying the spending measure to the Keystone XL pipeline. \n \n Reid said he wanted the vote to prove that the House measure lacks support \u2014 a first step, he said, to forcing negotiations on a compromise. Under Senate rules, Democrats can demand a vote on the bill Saturday but need members\u2019 unanimous consent to vote before then. \n \n \u201cThe sooner we put this useless partisan charade behind us, the sooner we can negotiate a solution that protects middle-class workers,\u201d Reid said. \n \n But McConnell insisted that the Senate should first take up the spending measure, which would keep the government funded through September. \n \n Republicans say bipartisan negotiators have reached a deal on the spending bill. But they say the White House and Reid will not allow a final vote on the measure, holding the bill hostage and threatening a shutdown to increase Democratic leverage on the payroll tax issue. \n \n Before filing the government funding bill after midnight Thursday, House Republicans huddled for two hours late Wednesday to discuss whether to proceed with a vote, even without a Democratic sign-off. \n \n That could prove tricky. Many conservatives object to the bill\u2019s $1.043 trillion spending level, negotiated by Democrats and Republicans in the August debt deal, and it\u2019s not clear whether the bill could pass without some Democratic support. \n \n House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters late Wednesday that no decisions had been made, but that the House had acted to extend the tax cut and now it was the Senate\u2019s turn. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m tired of hearing what the Senate can\u2019t do,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s time for us to wait and see what the Senate can do.\u201d \n \n When the House passes a spending bill, lawmakers can go on their holiday break, leaving Senate Democrats with the unpleasant choice of accepting the House\u2019s payroll tax bill or rejecting it and taking the blame for allowing the tax break to expire. \n \n The tension highlighted the fact that neither side has come up with a way to pay for the tax cut that can get the 60 votes necessary for Senate approval. \n \n Senate Democrats say that the House bill is unacceptable and that they will vote against it, and the White House has said Obama would veto it. \n \n Their objections center on several GOP initiatives added to the bill to attract votes from conservatives, many of whom would not support the tax cut extension otherwise. They include cuts in unemployment benefits, new rules that could require the unemployed to take drug tests and enroll in GED programs to receive benefits and the delay of new regulations on boiler emissions. \n \n The bill would also extend a pay freeze for federal workers and raise Medicare premiums for upper-income seniors. And the two sides are clashing over a provision that would force a decision on a construction permit for the Keystone XL within 60 days. The State Department, which is reviewing the pipeline issue, has said that if forced to make a decision so quickly, it would have to deny the permit. \n \n Twice, the Senate has also blocked Democratic proposals for the millionaire surtax. \n \n If government shuts down, some agencies and departments would continue working, thanks to a partial spending bill passed in November. The departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, State and Transportation, as well as NASA and some other smaller agencies, would be spared. \n \n But much of the government would be shuttered. National parks would close, for instance, and processing of some passports would cease. The showdown marks the fourth time this year that congressional disputes have dragged the government to the brink of a partial shutdown. \n \n Behind the white-hot rhetoric of their leaders, many rank-and-file lawmakers predicted that there would be a last-minute compromise to extend the tax cut and prevent a shutdown. A number of them wearily said that the only casualty of the fight would be Congress\u2019s already battered reputation. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s all going to get passed eventually,\u201d said Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.). \u201cBut the political maneuvering is sickening.\u201d \n \n Staff writers Paul Kane, Ed O\u2019Keefe, David Nakamura and Felicia Sonmez contributed to this report. ||||| The endgame at hand, both Democratic and Republican congressional leaders expressed optimism Thursday at prospects for swift compromise to extend Social Security tax cuts, keep long-term jobless benefits flowing and avoid a threatened partial government shutdown at midnight Friday. \n \n President Barack Obama speaks in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on the campus in Washington, Thursday, Dec. 15, 2011, where he announced action to provide minimum wage and overtime protections... (Associated Press) \n \n Still another year-end bill, setting new rules for the handling of terror suspects in U.S. custody, won final congressional approval and headed to President Barack Obama's desk for his signature. \n \n \"Right now, Congress needs to make sure that 160 million working Americans don't see their taxes go up on Jan. 1,\" said Obama, referring to the tax cut extension at the core of the jobs program he outlined in a nationally televised speech three months ago. \n \n House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, the most powerful Republican in an era of divided government, agreed. \"We can extend payroll tax relief for American workers, help create new jobs and keep the government running. And frankly, we can do it in a bipartisan way,\" he said. \n \n The long-moribund job market, too, appeared to be on the mend. Government figures showed 366,000 applications for unemployment benefits were filed last week, the lowest number since the near-collapse of the financial system in 2008 and the brutal recession that followed. \n \n In the Capitol, the previous day's bristling rhetoric and partisan jabs all but vanished.0 \n \n Republicans agreed to consider changes to a $1 trillion spending bill compromise that they and at least one Democrat said had been wrapped up days ago. The White House said it wanted adjustments. \n \n There were separate negotiations on legislation to extend the Social Security payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits. Democrats abandoned their demand for a surtax on million-dollar incomes that they wanted to include in the measure, removing a provision that Republicans strongly opposed. \n \n \"We hope that we can come up with something that would get us out of here at a reasonable time in the next few days,\" said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. \n \n At a news conference, Boehner minimized the concession, noting that Democrats lacked the votes to impose the surtax a year ago when they commanded 60 votes in the Senate. Even so, he said, \"there was some movement yesterday from the White House and Democrat leaders\" toward a compromise. \n \n Boehner also left open the possibility of a compromise on another key sticking point _ a House-passed provision that all but requires construction of the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline from Canada to Texas. \n \n Construction \"will put 20,000 people to work immediately And there are about 115,000 other jobs directly related to it,\" he said. Yet he skipped an opportunity to say construction of the project was a non-negotiable condition as talks on the payroll tax cut bill proceed. \n \n Obama has threatened to veto the House-passed bill, in part citing the requirement for the pipeline. The project has been studied for more than three years, but the president recently announced he would put off a decision until after the 2012 elections. \n \n Without an extension of the payroll tax cut, 160 million Americans will have smaller take home pay beginning on Jan. 1, a fact that the president and leaders of both parties stressed as they looked for compromise. \n \n Obama asked Congress to extend and also to expand the payroll tax cut that took effect last Jan. 1 and is due to expire at the end of the year. The House-passed bill renews the current reduction for one year, and it was unclear whether a final compromise would go any further. \n \n The president also wants to leave in place a system that provides aid for up to 99 weeks for the long-term unemployed. The House-passed measure reduces the total by 20 weeks, a step that the administration says would cut off 3.3 million individuals and that Democrats are hoping to soften if not reverse. \n \n Also part of the negotiations was an attempt to head off a threatened 27 percent cut in payments to doctors who treat Medicare patients, an item added in the House to appeal to conservatives unhappy at extending the payroll tax cuts. \n \n Reid indicated that a number of expiring tax breaks were on the table, as well, a list that included a provision that benefits commuters who use mass transit. \n \n In a bow to deficit-conscious conservatives in the House, Obama and leaders in both parties have agreed to offset the cost of the measure to avoid raising deficits. \n \n The White House and Democrats wanted to use the surtax on million-dollar income to finance most of the bill. But with that off the table, they were required to look elsewhere in talks with Republicans. \n \n The House-passed measure relied on a pay freeze and increased pension contributions for federal workers, as well as higher Medicare premiums for seniors with incomes over $80,000, beginning in 2017. The bill would also would raise a fee that is charged to banks whose mortgages are guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and cancel more than $40 billion from the year-old health care bill that is Obama's signature domestic achievement. \n \n At about $1 trillion, the year-end spending measure would lock in cuts that Republicans extracted from Democrats in negotiations conducted months ago against the deadline of a previous government shutdown threat. \n \n This time, the two sides reached an agreement days ago, according to Republicans and at least one Democrat, well ahead of the Friday midnight deadline. Somewhat belatedly, the White House and Reid insisted otherwise, and Republicans accused them of reneging on the deal to gain leverage in negotiations on the payroll tax bill. \n \n In response to the Democrats, House Republicans threatened on Wednesday to repackage the measure and pass it. The leadership held the threat in abeyance while compromise negotiations took place. \n \n The separate defense bill covered military personnel, weapons systems, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and more at a cost of $662 billion, $27 billion below Obama's request. The Senate approved it by a resounding 86-13. \n \n The main controversy revolved around a provision to require military custody for foreign terrorist suspects linked to al-Qaida or its affiliates and involved in plotting or attacking the United States. Under a change made to gain Obama's backing, the legislation would permit the FBI to arrest and interrogate foreign terror suspects, as is now the case. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Donna Cassata and Andrew Taylor contributed to this story. ||||| Harry Reid says he's still hoping for a longer-term deal on the payroll tax. Payroll, benefits talks continue \n \n Congressional leaders finalized a deal on Thursday to fund the government through next fall and are now considering a short-term extension of a payroll tax holiday and jobless benefits that would affect millions of Americans next year. \n \n After a marathon round of negotiations, Democrats and Republicans signed off on a $1 trillion spending bill to keep the government funded through next fall, and that plan is expected to be approved by the full House and Senate on Friday, hours before many federal agencies would have been forced to shutter their doors. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n But sticking points remained over how to pay for a year-long extension of a payroll tax holiday, jobless benefits and to avert a scheduled pay decrease for physicians serving Medicare patients. So negotiators are now actively considering a $40-billion, two-month extension on those measures. \n \n A two-month extension would \u201cmake sure people continue to get their \u2026 payroll tax holiday and also the unemployment benefits and also doctors would be able to continue to do their work on Medicare patients,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) told reporters as he left the Capitol Thursday night. Reid added that he still hoped for a longer-term deal on those matters. \n \n But it would also reignite a battle over the issue just as President Barack Obama is campaigning for reelection. A senior administration official said short-term extension would meet Obama\u2019s principle that taxes don\u2019t go up on the middle class, but they were withholding a fuller analysis until they saw a bill. \n \n On Thursday night, Reid also filed a procedural motion to cut off debate on the House-passed payroll bill, setting up a vote as late as Saturday morning. The bill could be used as the vehicle for a final year-end deal, sources say. \n \n Negotiations on a year-long extension over the payroll tax plan \u2014 which has been demanded by Obama \u2014 are expected to continue Friday. \n \n \u201cEverything is still moving along,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) after leaving a Thursday night meeting with other Democratic leaders. \n \n By Thursday afternoon, expectations were growing that an agreement could be reached that would allow the House and Senate to vote on a government funding bill by Friday. Sources said an increase in funding for the enforcement of the Dodd-Frank financial services law and to change language tightening travel restrictions to Cuba helped generate Democratic support. \n \n Staff for Senate leaders had been holed up in the backrooms of the Capitol, deliberating over weighty issues involving how the costs of the extensions should be paid for and how to resolve other sticking points, such as a provision calling for the construction of a major oil pipeline. Separate negotiations were ongoing between the White House and top Republicans over policy riders in the year-end spending bill. \n \n After an acrimonious first half of the week, there were growing signs Thursday that a deal was within reach and that leaders were eager to put to an end a bitter year of legislation that has been marked by three near-government shutdowns and fears over a debt default. ||||| Democrats, GOP make final effort to pass tax bill, stave off government shutdown \n \n By Erik Wasson - \n \n The House and Senate have begun final negotiations on a $1 trillion omnibus. \n \n House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers (R-Ky.) said talks are under way and that \u201cthings are looking up.\u201d \n \n Rogers said he is hopeful that Senate appropriators will be allowed to sign the conference report soon. \n \n \"We're optimistic that the senators will sign the conference report and we'll get things concluded,\" Rogers said. \n \n \"Things are looking up and I am looking up,\" he added, putting his hands together as if in prayer. \n \n The House unveiled the omnibus legislation Wednesday night, though Democrats hadn\u2019t signed off on the agreement. However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) on Thursday signaled the sides were edging closer to a deal. \n \n Unless Congress approves an omnibus or a short-term measure to fund the government before Saturday, most of the government will shut down this weekend. The departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development would not be affected since their appropriations bills were already approved. \n \n The omnibus has been a bargaining chip in a separate fight over extending the payroll tax cut extension. Both sides have been looking for leverage in that fight, as neither side wants to be blamed for a failure to extend the tax cut. \n \n It remains unclear whether the House and Senate will be able to resolve their differences and complete work on both the payroll tax measure and the omnibus before the end of the year. Members in both chambers are hoping to leave Washington by Friday, but it remains possible lawmakers will work through the weekend and into next week to finish up the two measures. \n \n Rep. Jim Moran of Virginia, a senior Democratic appropriator, played down the chances of the government partially shutting down at Friday\u2019s end. \n \n But he also called the whole showdown over the omnibus spending bill an \u201cindictment of the legislative process.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m embarrassed that it happened, but I think the chances of a shutdown are zero,\u201d said Moran, whose Northern Virginia district contains many federal workers. \n \n Moran said it was his \u201chope and expectation\u201d that lawmakers would sign off on the conference report for the omnibus package on Thursday, and that the legislation would receive a floor vote on Friday. \n \n The Virginia Democrat also chided the Obama administration for pushing to link the government spending measure with the extension of the payroll tax cut, in an attempt to gain more leverage over congressional Republicans. \n \n \u201cSome folks have communicated to the White House that they should not be using federal employees as pawns in a larger issue, that if we have an an omnibus appropriations bill that can, and should, and will eventually be enacted, we should do it now and not hold it up,\u201d Moran said. \n \n Rogers did not specify which provisions of the omnibus bill would be reopened, but Republicans have said they are willing to negotiate over language limiting travel by Cuban-Americans to Cuba. \n \n A senior Democratic appropriator, Rep. Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.), pointed to a dispute over travel restrictions to Cuba as the last sticking point, voicing amazement that the communist island still divided Congress. \u201cTechnically we\u2019ve got one issue holding up the package, and it\u2019s Cuba again, 52 years later,\u201d Serrano told reporters. \n \n He said House and Senate negotiators had agreed to eliminate a provision reinstating a longstanding travel ban loosened by President Obama, but that Boehner\u2019s office intervened. \u201cThe Speaker has made it a priority,\u201d Serrano said. \n \n He said that the change could have immediate effects because the Treasury Department estimates that 300,000 Cuban Americans travel to Cuba over the holidays and those already in Cuba could be in violation of the law if it passes. \n \n \u201cLets say the bill gets approved tomorrow and the president signs it Saturday morning: Saturday morning, folks who left and are in Cuba already are in violation of federal law. Nobody thought about this,\u201d Serrano said. \u201cThe charter company that flew them to Cuba technically couldn\u2019t go and pick them up, because they would be in violation of federal law.\u201d \n \n Serrano said that he wants assurances the president would waive the provision if a waiver was inserted into the rider. \n \n \u201cThe most amazing thing is that Cuba is still a congressional issue 52 years later,\u201d he said. \n \n Prior to Thursday, Democrats had said there were just five issues remaining on the omnibus: the prohibition on Cuba travel, a prohibition on light bulbs standards, a prohibition on D.C-funded abortion, a provision allowing the military to treat coal as an alternative fuel and a desire by the White House to tack on increased funding for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission which had its funding cut in the minibus passed last month. \n \n \u2014 This story was posted at 2:20 p.m. and was last updated at 3:52 p.m. \n \n Russell Berman and Bernie Becker contributed to this story.",

Also looking up are prospects for deals to extend the payroll tax cuts and jobless benefits, say the Washington Post, AP, Politico, and the Hill. Much of the optimism stems from the fact that lawmakers are managing not to snarl at each other in public, unlike yesterday. Some examples: Harry Reid: \"We've done enough back and forth. ... We hope that we can come up with something that would get us out of here at a reasonable time in the next few days.\" John Boehner: \"We can extend payroll tax relief for American workers, help create new jobs and keep the government running.

    "document": "A former police officer from Siberia who was jailed for murdering 22 women has been charged over another 47 deaths to which he has confessed, making him Russia\u2019s most prolific killer. \n \n Mikhail Popkov, nicknamed the Werewolf, was handed a life sentence two years ago after the murders in the city of Angarsk, near Lake Baikal. He attacked women he considered were immoral because they were out late at night. \n \n Between 1994 and 2000 Popkov offered his victims lifts before taking them to remote locations where he killed them with axes, knives or screwdrivers. Three of the murders were committed while he was on duty, using a police car. \n \n Local media reported that Popkov, 49, had admitted in prison to another 60 killings. So far prosecutors\u2026 ||||| Popkov has confessed to 59 new murders. Picture: Vostochno-Sibirskaya Pravda \n \n Siberian maniac and former policeman Mikhail Popkov - who raped his victims before killing them - appears to be the world's third worst known serial killer. \n \n In an interview today with The Siberian Times, the Russian Investigative Committee - the Russian equivalent of the FBI - clarified a series of confusing news agency and newspaper reports this week on the number of new cases. \n \n The true total of women victims - believed to be aged 17 to 38 - is far higher than previously reported. \n \n The sensational new findings follow intensive detective work over two years since father-of-one Popkov - who was married when he committed his offences and is nicknamed 'The Werewolf' - was convicted in January 2015 of an initial 22 murders of mostly young women. \n \n Irkutsk Investigative Committee spokeswoman Karina Golovacheva: 'So there are 59 new murders. That means, if we add them to the earlier 22, it will be 81 murders in total.' Picture: Investigative Committee in Irkutsk region \n \n The butcher sexually attacked his mainly young female victims before slaying them with axes, knives or screwdrivers over an 18 year period immediately following the collapse of the Soviet Union. \n \n Irkutsk Investigative Committee spokeswoman Karina Golovacheva admitted there had been confusion over the numbers, and used her interview with The Siberian Times to officially clarify and confirm the sinister detail of Popkov's reign of terror. \n \n 'To clarify the numbers, Popkov has confessed to 59 new murders,' she said. 'We are not counting in this total those 22 for which he was already sentenced. These cases are already closed. \n \n 'So there are 59 new murders. That means, if we add them to the earlier 22, it will be 81 murders in total.' \n \n Popkov (middle) has a higher total than worst-ever Soviet serial killer Andrei Chikatilo (right) who was convicted of 53 murders, and the more recent Moscow maniac Alexander Pichushkin (left), known as the Chessboard Killer, who killed 49. Picture: The Siberian Times \n \n She said that currently he is charged with 47 new murders, and another dozen are still officially under investigation, but imminent charges are expected over these additional alleged crimes. \n \n She emphasised: 'We are quite sure about the 12 other cases. We are now gathering all the evidence.' Further analysis of the evidence is underway and 'in the nearest future we can bring charges in these 12 cases' which Popkov has already admitted. \n \n Earlier, contradictory reports in Russian news agencies led to conflicting reports on the numbers. \n \n But it is today clear that Popkov - on the basis of charges to which he has already confessed - has a higher total than worst-ever Soviet serial killer Andrei Chikatilo, aka the Butcher of Rostov, who was convicted of 53 murders, and the more recent Moscow maniac Alexander Pichushkin, known as the Chessboard Killer, who killed 49. \n \n He is also higher than Ukrainian Anatoly Onoprienko, who was active at the end of the Soviet era, and was convicted of a total of 52 murders. \n \n 'He says very clearly, when and what was done. We are looking for evidence that confirms his words. A large number of episodes are confirmed.' Picture: Investigative Committee, The Siberian Times \n \n If - as expected following his confessions - his toll is confirmed by the court as 81, only two serial killers in the world, Luis Garavito and Pedro Lopez, both South American, will have had higher numbers of proven victims. \n \n 'When the investigation is finished, and Popkov has read the case materials, the trial can begin,' she said. \n \n It is also now established that his murders continued for a full decade after police previously believed they had stopped. 'The period of his murders also has changed,' she said. 'He was killing women from 1992 to 2010, so he did not stop in 2000.' \n \n Earlier, investigators believed he was correct in saying that he had halted his vicious sexual attacks and killings in 2000 because he became 'impotent' after contracting venereal disease from a victim. \n \n Tatiana Martynova (right) with a friend Yulia Kuprikova (middle) who they were both killed together.

Viktoria Chagaeva, 49, who owns a beauty salon in Angarsk, with a picture of her beloved younger sister Tatiana, killed by the 'Wednesday murderer'. Pictures: The Siberian Times \n \n Popkov is co-operating with investigators, and his testimony has been crucial to uncovering the 59 new cases. But it is not ruled out that there are more cases than the 81 he admits. \n \n One theory is that he is deliberately rationing his confessions to delay the moment when he is sent from his current detention prison to a harsh penal colony to serve his life sentence. \n \n In a court appearance in Irkutsk, details of which have just been disclosed, he was asked by judge Pavel Rukavishnikov how many women he had killed. He shrugged and replied: 'I can't say exactly, I didn't keep a record.' \n \n But the mass killer told the court: 'I admit my guilt in full'....'committing the murders, I was guided by my inner convictions.' \n \n After he was detained in 2012, he told police he wanted to 'cleanse' the streets of 'prostitutes'. \n \n The maniac's victims, top to bottom - Yulia Shapovalova and Maria Molotkova; Maria Molotkova funerals, and pictures of two other victims, Marina Lyzhina, 35 (l) and Liliya Pashkovskaya, 37 (r) at their funerals. Pictures: The Siberian Times \n \n He often offered victims nighttime lifts in his police car before taking them to remote locations where he raped and killed them, leaving their naked bodies in woods on roadsides. \n \n Senior investigator Andrei Bunayev disclosed last year: 'The investigation will be very long because there are a lot of cases. He names the places where bodies are hidden. \n \n 'We find these bodies, and check his involvement. He says very clearly, when and what was done. We are looking for evidence that confirms his words. A large number of episodes are confirmed.' \n \n He said Popkov 'left biological traces in some cases which were not studied earlier - but now there is an opportunity to examine them'. In other cases, sites were dug up guided by the convicted mass murderer. \n \n Victim Yulia Kuprikova, killed by the 'Wednesday murderer'. Picture: The Siberian Times \n \n 'Popkov is collaborating with us,' he said. 'Everything he says is confirmed. He confidently guides us to the place where a body is found and explains what happened, what injuries he caused.' \n \n After he ceased being a policeman, it is known Popkov drove between his home city of Angarsk, in Irkutsk region, where many of his crimes were committed, and Vladivostok, on the country's Pacific coast, a distance of some 3,900 kilometres. \n \n Yet a painstaking search has not found evidence of crimes in other regions - so far. \n \n 'It was established that he killed women in other cities and towns of Irkutsk region, but we have not found any evidence he killed someone in other regions,' - said Lieutenant Golovacheva. \n \n \n \n 'At the moment we cannot give much detail as the investigation is ongoing. We can say more when the trial starts.' \n \n Two of his earlier victims were Tatiana (Tanya) Martynova, 20, and Yulia Kuprikova, 19, found dead on 29 October 1998 in an Angarsk suburb following a night out. \n \n One theory is that he began his murder spree after - wrongly - suspecting his wife Elena of cheating on him. Pictures: Channel 1, NTV \n \n 'The pain does not go away - it was me who gave Tanya a ticket to go to a concert, and she was killed after attending it,\" said her sister Viktoria Chagaeva, 49, who owns a beauty salon in Angarsk. \n \n Popkov's wife Elena, 51, and daughter Ekaterina, 29, a teacher, initially stood by him, refusing to believe he was a mass killer. But since his trial they have moved to another city to begin new lives. \n \n One theory is that he began his murder spree after - wrongly - suspecting his wife of cheating on him. He found two used condoms in the rubbish at home, and this led to his drive to take revenge on women, it is claimed. In fact the contraceptives had been used by guests. \n \n 'I just had some reasons to suspect her,' said Popkov, of his belief that his wife had slept with another man. 'I'm not looking for excuses, but this was the impetus for my future.' \n \n His daughter Ekaterina, 29, a teacher, initially stood by him, refusing to believe he was a mass killer. Pictures: Channel 1, NTV \n \n He admitted to having a negative view of women who went out at night to drink without their husbands or boyfriends. Now he says: 'I had no right to evaluate people, their behaviour ... this is my repentance.' \n \n He evaded capture for years because police could not contemplate that one of their own officers could be a mass killer. \n \n He daughter at first refused to believe he could be a mass killer. \n \n 'I do not believe any of this. I always felt myself as 'Daddy's girl',' she said. 'For 25 years we were together, hand in hand. \n \n 'We walked, rode bikes, went to the shops, and he met me from school. We both collect model cars, so we have the same hobby. I wanted to be a criminologist, so I read a book with tips of how investigators catch serial killers and there were also basic classifications [about murderers]. \n \n he told police he wanted to 'cleanse' the streets of 'prostitutes' in his home city of Angarsk where he worked as a policeman. Pictures: The Siberian Times, Photo-Angarsk \n \n 'Daddy doesn't fit any of these classifications -- he doesn't look like some maniac.' \n \n Popkov has previous told journalists that he was only caught because of advances in DNA technology used to tackle crimes. \n \n 'I could not anticipate the examination of DNA,' he said. 'I was born in another century. Now there are such modern technologies, methods, but not earlier. If we have not got to that level of genetic examination, then ... I would not be sitting in front of you.' \n \n Asked he could turn back time, what he would do differently, he said: 'All initially should have been changed. Straight from school. Since childhood.' ||||| \n \n (Photo courtesy Siberian Times) \n \n Former Siberian policeman Mikhail Popkov, who is already serving a life sentence for the murders of 22 women, has confessed to killing 59 more, police told the Siberian Times. \n \n Nicknamed the \u201cwerewolf\u201d of Siberia for the brutality of his methods \u2014 he raped women and then killed them with axes, knives or screwdrivers \u2014 Mikhail Popkov carried out his bloody rampage between 1992 and 2010 in the Angarsk and Irkutsk regions of Siberia, the paper reported. According to the state news agency Tass, he resigned as a police officer in 1998. \n \n When he was first detained in 2012, the Siberian Times said, he told police his goal was to \u201ccleanse\u201d the streets of prostitutes. \n \n According to Tass, the investigation began when women kept disappearing from public places in Angarsk in the mid-1990s, at the time Popkov was a police officer. Later, authorities started finding mutilated bodies of the women around Irkutsk. \n \n They also found tire tracks from a Niva cross-country vehicle at some of the crime scenes, which ultimately led them to Popkov. \n \n At first he confessed to three murders. \n \n But as police investigated, and as he began talking, the number rose to the 22 for which he was convicted and sentenced in January 2015. \n \n Irkutsk police spokeswoman Karina Golovacheva has told the Siberian Times that Popkov has now confessed to 59 new slayings. \u201cThat means, if we add them to the earlier 22, it will be 81 murders in total.\u201d Of the 59 cases, 47 have produced charges. \u201cWe are quite sure about the 12 other cases,\u201d Golovacheva told the paper, and \u201cin the nearest future we can bring charges\u201d in the twelve others. \n \n The victims have ranged in age from 17 to 38. \n \n Popkov, according to earlier reports of the case, started his spree when he was a policeman, offering women rides in his police car and then taking them to remote locations and raping and killing them. \n \n After laborious probes, police have found body after body in the places where Popkov told them they were hidden. \n \n The Siberian Times speculated that he was confessing gradually to the killings rather than all at once in hopes of delaying his transfer from a detention prison to a penal colony. \n \n If authorities ultimately confirm 81 as the number of Popkov\u2019s victims, that would make him one of the most prolific serial killers of all time, behind Colombia\u2019s Luis Garavito, a child-killer nicknamed \u201cThe Beast\u201d who claimed at least 138 lives in the 1990s, and Pedro L\u00f3pez (\u201cThe Monster of the Andes\u201d) with 110 proven victims in Colombia, Ecuador and Peru between 1969 and 1980. \n \n More from Morning Mix \n \n \u2018Flip or Flop\u2019: The phoenix-like rise and bizarre fall of HGTV\u2019s second favorite couple \n \n Shaking hands is \u2018barbaric\u2019: Donald Trump, the germaphobe in chief \n \n Trailer showing white actor portraying Michael Jackson makes his daughter \u2018want to vomit\u2019 \n \n Introducing Daliyah, the 4-year-old girl who has read more than 1,000 books",

The 22-year-old, however, who picked up a bronze medal at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia, appears to have an uphill battle to get there. \n \n Citing \u201crecent struggles on and off the ice,\u201d Gold said in a statement (via USA Today) on Friday that she will take some time off \u201cto seek some professional help.\u201d \n \n Gold did not elaborate on what exactly her struggles have been \u201coff the ice,\u201d but recent performances have revealed some of her on-ice issues. \n \n The two-time national champion has found herself uncharacteristically missing out on the podium at the U.S. Championships last year. She finished in sixth place, which was just the start of her season-long rut. \n \n \u201cI just never felt so disappointed in myself,\u201d the Missouri native said about the performance (via the Kansas City Star). \n \n Gold would go on to compete in two Grand Prix events, where she continued to be unable to execute jumps that used to look simple to the star. The 2016 Trophee de France proved a low point for the skater. She finished in eighth place \u2014 her worst Grand Prix result ever. \n \n [Olympic runner found dead at the bottom of a condo complex swimming pool in Arizona] \n \n In her statement on Friday, Gold said her \u201cpassion for skating and training remains strong,\u201d and that she had no intention of retiring. \n \n She said the time she plans to take off as she prepares for her Grand Prix assignments in November \u201cwill help me become a stronger person, which I believe will be reflected in my skating performances as well.\u201d \n \n According to USA Today, Gold will now miss at least one scheduled event, the Japan Open on Oct. 7. \n \n Gold, who has always been quick to give public emotional responses to her performances, came down particularly hard on herself last year as she struggled. She made her biggest headlines, however, when she addressed the topic of weight after her poor Skate America performance in October. \n \n \u201cYou don\u2019t often see \u2014 there aren\u2019t that many \u2014 you just don\u2019t see overweight figure skaters for a reason,\u201d Gold said (via USA Today) just minutes after exiting the ice. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I\u2019ve struggled with this whole year and in previous seasons. It\u2019s just difficult when you\u2019re trying to do the difficult triple jumps. It\u2019s something that I am addressing but it\u2019s obviously not where it should be for this caliber of competition.\u201d \n \n Gold, of course, is not \u201coverweight\u201d by usual standards, which one reporter pointed out to her. Gold thanked the journalist, but added, \u201cIt\u2019s a lean body sport and it\u2019s just not what I have currently.\u201d \n \n Former U.S. figure skater and Olympic gold medalist Tara Lipinski seconded Gold\u2019s concerns, noting weight is something \u201cevery skater\u2019s thinking about.\u201d \n \n \u201cI think you don\u2019t [see skaters] talk about it because in reality saying you need to lose weight when you\u2019re already thin is a bit crazy,\u201d Lipinski added (via NBC Sports), noting figure skating isn\u2019t unlike gymnastics or ballet where \u201cthere is always this pressure to be very thin, not only for aesthetics, but just for your actual sport and how you use your body.\u201d \n \n [Olympic cross-country champion\u2019s lip-balm ban will keep her out of PyeongChang] \n \n If expectations are not properly managed, there can be dire consequences for skaters.

The 19-year-old, who won gold at the 2014 Olympics when she was just 15, recently completed a three-month treatment program to address her eating disorder. \n \n Former U.S. figure skater Jenny Kirk, who also suffered from the disorder, told the HuffPost in 2010 that she suspects up to 85 percent of top skaters suffer from \u201cvarious forms of disordered eating.\u201d \n \n Kirk, a former world junior champion, puts part of the blame on coaches and fans, but most on the skating system itself, which updated its scoring agenda to reward technical moves, jumps and spins, that she said are \u201ca lot harder \u2026 when one\u2019s body is more womanly.\u201d \n \n \u201cUntil this system is tweaked, I don\u2019t see a change in the number of injuries and the pressure for skaters to stay an unusually small size.\u201d \n \n Read more: \n \n Fox Sports reportedly has fired Pete Rose over underage-sex allegations \n \n Everton\u2019s Wayne Rooney charged with drunken driving in England \n \n Arsonist suspected of setting fire to Irish pro cycling team\u2019s bus at race in Spain \n \n Flock of confused birds brings baseball game to a halt in Japan ||||| CLOSE Olympic medalist Gracie Gold confirmed to People that she will be taking a break from figure skating to \u201cseek some professional help.\u201d Time \n \n Gracie Gold of the USA performs in the short program during the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games at Iceberg Skating Palace on Feb. 19. (Photo: Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports) \n \n Gracie Gold, a two-time U.S. figure skating champion and 2014 Olympic team bronze medalist whose last name and movie star looks have captivated her sport, said Friday morning in a statement released to USA TODAY Sports that she will be taking time off five months before the next Winter Olympics \"to seek some professional help.\u201d \n \n She did not say what kind of professional help she will be receiving. \n \n \u201cMy passion for skating and training remains strong,\u201d Gold said in the statement. \u201cHowever, after recent struggles on and off the ice, I realize I need to seek some professional help and will be taking some time off while preparing for my Grand Prix assignments. This time will help me become a stronger person, which I believe will be reflected in my skating performances as well.\u201d \n \n Gold was scheduled to open her 2018 Olympic season at the Japan Open, an invitational team competition in Saitama, Japan, on Oct. 7, but she now will not attend that event. Her Grand Prix assignments, in Beijing and Grenoble, France, are both scheduled in November. \n \n The 2018 U.S. Olympic figure skating trials are in early January, now just four months away. The 2018 Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, start Feb. 9. At no time in recent memory has a skater voluntarily taken time away from her sport at such a crucial moment.

Her decline culminated this spring and summer in a disheartening inability to land even the simplest jumps in skating shows and a U.S. Figure Skating preview camp. \n \n Gold\u2019s announcement comes just four days after Russian 2014 Olympic team gold medalist Julia Lipnitskaia announced her retirement at 19 after a battle with anorexia. Lipnitskaia\u2019s mother, Daniela, told the Russian news agency Tass on Monday that her daughter was retiring after three months of treatment for the eating disorder. \n \n Sometimes you have to get knocked down lower than you have ever been, to stand up taller than you ever were \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffc Feb 1st is National #GetUp day.

After a disappointing fifth-place finish at Skate America last October, she spoke boldly and admirably about the pressure she felt. \n \n \u201cYou don\u2019t often see \u2013 there aren\u2019t that many \u2013 you just don\u2019t see overweight figure skaters for a reason,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just something I\u2019ve struggled with this whole year and in previous seasons. It\u2019s just difficult when you\u2019re trying to do the difficult triple jumps. It\u2019s something that I am addressing but it\u2019s obviously not where it should be for this caliber of competition.\u201d \n \n A journalist picked up immediately on her use of the word \u201coverweight,\u201d saying correctly and appropriately that Gold looked slim. \n \n \u201cOh, that\u2019s lovely, thank you,\u201d she replied. \u201cIt\u2019s just not what\u2019s required for this sport. It\u2019s a lean body sport and it\u2019s just not what I have currently, but, thank you.\u201d \n \n Upheaval and uncertainty have followed her since. She could never regain her footing on the ice, finishing a dismal sixth at the 2017 national championships in January just a year after winning her second U.S. title. She missed the world championships for the first time in five years. \n \n Gracie Gold has won two U.S. national figure skating titles.

She looks like a movie star. She has such joie de vivre.\u2019 Then you ask yourself what happened to that. I hope she can find happiness.\u201d \n \n Gold is one of the most financially successful figure skaters of her era, with various sponsors including Red Bull, Smucker\u2019s and Nike. \n \n After leaving Carroll\u2019s training site in Los Angeles, she moved to Detroit to train with coaches Marina Zoueva and Oleg Epstein in suburban Canton, Mich. \n \n In addition to Gold's personal struggles, her father Carl, a Springfield, Ill., anesthesiologist, has been dealing with unwelcome attention. His medical license was suspended in February, according to the State Journal-Register in Springfield. The suspension, which prevents Carl Gold from practicing medicine for at least a year, was triggered by what state officials said was a violation of a June 2016 consent order that said the state was informed by the U.S. Department of Justice that Carl Gold \u201cdiverted Schedule II Controlled Substances\u201d from a Decatur, Ill., hospital \u201cfor personal use.\u201d",

    "document": "George A. Romero -- the writer and director behind the cult-classic horror flick \"Night of the Living Dead\" -- died Sunday. He was 77. \n \n Romero has been called the \"father of modern horror films.\" He died following \"a brief but aggressive battle with lung cancer,\" his longtime production partner Peter Grunwald told CNN. \n \n Grunwald said Romero passed away \"peacefully in his sleep\" while \"listening to the score of 'The Quiet Man,' one his all-time favorite films, with his wife Suzanne Desrocher Romero, and daughter, Tina Romero, at his side.\" \n \n \"[Romero] leaves behind a loving family, many friends and a filmmaking legacy that has endured, and will continue to endure, the test of time,\" Grunwald said. \n \n Romero was born in 1940 in New York City. His big break came with the release of \"Night of the Living Dead\" in 1968, which was his first feature-length movie and made on a $114,000 budget. The movie, snubbed by the mainstream press, became a smash hit among horror aficionados and gore lovers. \n \n Romero worked on several other projects to little box office success before the first \"Living Dead\" sequel, \"Dawn of the Dead,\" debuted in 1979 to great fanfare and critical acclaim. An initial backlash to some graphic special effects helped boost the film's notoriety, drawing more to theaters. \n \n \"Romero has created the ultimate American nightmare. We are feeding on ourselves. Some consider this one of the most important American films of the last decade and it should be seen,\" a review in the \"Motion Picture Guide\" reads. \n \n Romero continued his work in the horror genre throughout the 1980s. In 1990, he rewrote the original \"Living Dead\" screenplay for the franchise's first remake. That was followed by \"Land of the Dead\" in 2005. at 89 \n \n In 2006 Romero made \"Diary of the Dead,\" launching a new cycle of \"Living Dead\" zombie flicks, which also includes 2009's \"Survival of the Dead.\" \n \n His most recent project was a a graphic novel entitled \"Empire of the Dead,\" which was published by Marvel. \n \n New York magazine writer Cynthia Heimel wrote in 1980 that Romero \"is known for making the most grisly, horrifying movies you're ever likely to see.\" \n \n Mike Drucker, the standup comedian and \"Late Night\" jokes writer, credited Romero with \"reinventing\" zombies, which, since his 1968 creation, have become ubiquitous in movies, films and books. \n \n Without George Romero, about 1/3 of nerd culture things wouldn't exist. He re-invented zombies and now they seem so obvious. RIP. Damn. \u2014 Mike Drucker (@MikeDrucker) July 16, 2017 \n \n World famous horror writer Stephen King called Romero his \"favorite collaborator.\" \n \n Sad to hear my favorite collaborator--and good old friend--George Romero has died.

Romero, the legendary writer-director from Pittsburgh who made the 1968 cult classic Night of the Living Dead for $114,000, thus spawning an unrelenting parade of zombie movies and TV shows, has died. He was 77. \n \n Romero, who put out five other zombie movies after a copyright blunder cost him millions of dollars in profits on his wildly popular first one, died Sunday of lung cancer, his producing partner, Peter Grunwald, told the Los Angeles Times, which first reported the news. Romero's family confirmed his death to the newspaper as well. \n \n Romero's manager, Chris Roe, posted on Facebook that the director died while \"listening to the score of The Quiet Man, one of his all-time favorite films, with his wife, Suzanne Desrocher Romero, and daughter, Tina Romero, at his side. He died peacefully in his sleep following a brief but aggressive battle with lung cancer and leaves behind a loving family, many friends and a filmmaking legacy that has endured, and will continue to endure, the test of time.\" \n \n Romero's 1978 sequel Dawn of the Dead was made for $1.5 million and grossed $55 million. He followed that by writing and directing Day of the Dead (1985), Land of the Dead (2005), Diary of the Dead (2007) and Survival of the Dead (2009), a decomposing body of work that earned him the nickname Father of the Zombie Film. \n \n Romero also penned a new version of Night of the Living Dead, released in 1990, that was directed by Tom Savini, his longtime collaborator and horror effects guru. (And Dawn of the Dead was remade by Zack Snyder in 2004.) \n \n Some film scholars and horror enthusiasts contend that social commentary \u2014 specifically salvos against the military and materialism \u2014 lurked within Romero\u2019s films. Most of his work was shot in Pittsburgh, where Romero attended Carnegie Mellon University. \n \n Night of the Living Dead, the story of seven strangers trapped in a farmhouse besieged by a lynch-mob posse of staggering zombies, devastated/delighted audiences at the time of its release, its stark and grainy black-and-white cinematography imbuing it with a documentary realism. \n \n Romero and his nine other investors, including co-writer John A. Russo, had cobbled together $6,000 to start production on the film, then titled Night of the Flesh Eaters. It premiered at the Fulton Theater in Pittsburgh on Oct. 1, 1968, and quickly caught on as a staple of midnight screenings around the country. But most of the profits eluded the investors because of a mistake by the distributor. \n \n \"We lost the copyright on the film because we put it on the title,\" Romero explained in \"Night of the Living Steelers,\" an installment of NFL Films' Timeline series that premiered in October. \"Our title was Night of the Flesh Eaters; they changed it to Night of the Living Dead. \n \n \"When they changed the title, the copyright bug came off, so it went into public domain [and] we no longer had a piece of the action. Everybody had a copy of Night of the Living Dead because they were able to sell it without having to worry about royalties going to us.\" \n \n Night of the Living Dead was rare for its time in that it featured an African-American actor (Duane Jones) as a hero in a mainstream movie. \n \n After directing the box-office failures There's Always Vanilla (1971), Hungry Wives (1972) and The Crazies (1973), Romero, looking to make ends meet, produced a series of TV documentaries that focused on such Steeler legends-in-the-making as \"Mean\" Joe Greene, Franco Harris, Terry Bradshaw and Rocky Bleier. \n \n He returned to the zombie milieu with Dawn of the Dead (this time with copyright intact), which was filmed at the Monroeville Mall outside Pittsburgh. \"This was the first indoor mall we had ever seen,\" he said in the Timeline documentary. \"I said, 'Wow, this is a temple to consumerism. There's my topic.'\" \n \n Once, during an AFI screening of Night of the Living Dead, he was asked what terrified him. \"I don\u2019t have any supernatural hobgoblins that I worry about,\" he said. \"What scares me is life.\" \n \n George Andrew Romero was born Feb. 4, 1940, in the Bronx. As a teen, he was crazy about movies, especially the Michael Powell-Emeric Pressburger opera fantasy The Tales of Hoffmann (1951). To watch it, he had to rent a movie projector and a print of the film from a movie house in Manhattan. \n \n \"They had one print,\" he recalled. \"Whenever it was gone, I knew the guy who had it. And when that guy came in and it was gone, he knew who had it. And that guy was Marty Scorsese. \u2026 We were the only two people who rented Tales of Hoffmann.\" \n \n Romero studied art and design at Carnegie Mellon, graduated in 1960 and started a commercial production company, Image Ten Prods. He made a Calgon detergent ad that lampooned the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage and did a segment for the kids show Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood that showed the host preparing to have a tonsillectomy. \n \n All that helped pay for the camera his team used to shoot Night of the Living Dead. Money was tight, so the basement of his company's office on Fort Pitt Boulevard in Pittsburgh doubled as the farmhouse basement in the movie. \n \n Romero\u2019s other work included Knightriders (1981), a mayhem movie with combatants jousting on motorcycles; Creepshow (1982), modeled after horror comics and scripted by Stephen King; Monkey Shines (1988), a psychological thriller revolving around a killer simian; The Dark Half (1993), where a writer's alter ego aims to take over; and Bruiser (2000), about a man who finds his face transformed into a blank mask. \n \n Romero also dabbled in the world of comic books with the limited Marvel series Empire of the Dead. \n \n Glimpses of the man himself can be seen in many of his films, and he had a cameo as an FBI agent in Jonathan Demme\u2019s The Silence of the Lambs (1991). \n \n Thanks to Romero, Pittsburgh has been called the \"Zombie Capital of the World\" and each year hosts an event called Zombie Fest, complete with a brain-eating contest. \n \n \"I used to be the only guy in the playground, I was the only guy doing zombies,\" he said in the Timeline doc. \"Then all of a sudden The Walking Dead happened and it became mainstream. And now they're all over the place.\" \n \n Duane Byrge contributed to this report.",

    "document": "PEDAL \u2013 serious research about play \n \n What is PEDAL? \n \n PEDAL is located in the University of Cambridge\u2019s Faculty of Education, and was launched in October 2015 with funding from the LEGO Foundation. Our mission is to conduct academic research into the role of play in young children\u2019s education, development and learning to inform wider practice and policy. PEDAL is part of the Psychology, Education and Learning Studies Research Group at the Faculty. \n \n Why research play? \n \n Play is an integral part of a happy childhood. All children and most adults engage in playful activities, including physical play, play with objects, symbolic play, pretence play and games with rules. At the minimum, it is clear that play is enjoyed by its participants, and this alone indicates it has motivational value in relation to learning. \n \n However, beyond this, little has been scientifically established about the possible benefits of human playfulness, and it is currently under-researched. Play advocates claim that it enhances learning, has a clear role in education, and supports emotional well-being, good mental health, creativity and social competence. As such, it follows that play may have the potential to contribute to economic, social and cultural development. \n \n Through PEDAL's research, the role of play in children\u2019s education, development and learning will be more widely understood by those involved in their care and education. New insights will inform effective evidence-based policy and practice \u2013 and will unlock a source of knowledge and inspiration that will improve children\u2019s lives around the world. ||||| The Faculty of Education at the University of Cambridge is consistently ranked in the top five in the world and now seeks to appoint a new Professor in the Faculty arising from an endowment to the University from the LEGO Foundation. \n \n The generous grant from the LEGO foundation has funded the LEGO\u00ae Professorship of Play in Education, Development, and Learning and the Board of Electors now invites applications for this Professorship from outstanding scholars in the field of educational or developmental psychology in early years development and would particularly welcome applications from those working in the field of play and playfulness. \n \n In association with the Professorship, the LEGO Foundation has further funded the establishment of a research Centre in Play in Education, Development and Learning (PEDAL). The Centre will examine the importance of play and playfulness in education globally with an aim to produce research which supports excellence in education so that children are equipped with 21st Century skills like problem solving, team work and self-control. \n \n Candidates for the LEGO\u00ae Professorship in the Faculty of Education will have an outstanding research record of international stature and the vision, leadership, experience and enthusiasm to act as Director of the newly established Centre for Research on Play in Education, Development and Learning (PEDAL). \n \n Standard professorial duties include teaching and research, examining, supervision and administration. The Professor will be based in Cambridge. A competitive salary will be offered. \n \n The University has engaged Perrett Laver to support the Board of Electors in this appointment process and further information is available at from Perrett Laver by emailing LEGO@perrettlaver.com. \n \n Applications, consisting of a letter of application, a statement of current and future research plans, a curriculum vitae and a publications list, along with details of three referees should be made by emailing LEGO@perrettlaver.com no later than 20 January 2017. \n \n Please quote reference JR10956 on your application and in any correspondence about this vacancy. \n \n The University values diversity and is committed to equality of opportunity. \n \n The University has a responsibility to ensure that all employees are eligible to live and work in the UK. ||||| The world\u2019s first professor of play \u2013 funded by Lego \u2013 is being sought by Cambridge University. What is the job description? \n \n There are only three days left to apply for what could be the most coveted job in education: the Lego professor of play, development and learning at the University of Cambridge. \n \n The closing date for applications for the brand new, permanent post is this Friday, 20 January. The successful candidate will not only enjoy all the perks of a typical Cambridge professor \u2013 including a job that commands an average salary of \u00a383,981 \u2013 he or she will also lead Cambridge\u2019s newly established Centre for Research on Play in Education, Development and Learning (Pedal). \n \n \u201cThe value of play is relatively under-researched,\u201d says Prof Anna Vignoles, interim director of Pedal and a member of Cambridge University\u2019s faculty of education. \u201cYou have people who are claiming that it enhances learning, that it\u2019s important, that it\u2019s good for children\u2019s wellbeing. All of that might be true, but actually there\u2019s remarkably little evidence for that. The aim of the Pedal centre is to conduct rigorous research into the importance of play and how playful learning can be used to improve students\u2019 outcomes.\u201d \n \n Although the Lego Foundation, which owns 25% of the Lego business, will have no say over who is appointed, it is committed to funding the role in perpetuity and has already made a \u00a34m endowment to the university. Of this, \u00a32.5m has been put aside for the professorship. The remaining \u00a31.5m is going to the Pedal centre, whose agenda will, in the future, be determined by the interests of the new professor. \n \n The university is planning to offer the role to an academic who specialises in educational psychology, to enable the centre to step up its research capabilities in this field. \u201cChildren are now increasingly accessing early-years provision at very young ages,\u201d says Vignoles. \u201cThere are a number of scholars who are working on interesting aspects of that in developmental psychology. We\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll attract an outstanding scholar.\u201d \n \n The Lego Foundation is hoping for a candidate with a \u201cchildlike mindset\u201d: \u201can academic who is playful, extremely curious, open-minded, imaginative and creative \u2013 someone who can think of new ways of doing research and work across different disciplines,\u201d says Bo Stjerne Thomsen, global head of research for the Lego Foundation. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Lego\u2019s global head of research, Bo Stjerne Thomsen, says the foundation wants to \u2018encourage more playful learning in schools, rather than testing\u2019. Photograph: Jonas Fotografi \n \n The foundation believes play has a critical role for children, particularly in high-quality learning. \u201cPlay should be part of education,\u201d says Stjerne Thomsen. \u201cWhat we want is to get the UK government to encourage more playful learning in schools, rather than testing. If children are being taught with standardised assessments and results, those children will expect to receive assignments and be led towards pre-defined goals for the rest of their lives. \n \n \u201cBut the skills you need now as an adult are collaboration, problem solving and coming up with ideas. In that sense, play is critical. You use your imagination to plan things, to predict outcomes, to understand how to solve a problem by looking at it from different perspectives. \n \n \u201cFor us, this is a unique opportunity to build research and interventions that can inform government policy, and also teachers \u2013 who are very good at teaching, but need other perspectives on the curriculum.\u201d \n \n Vignoles, though, emphasises that the professor will not be expected to become an advocate for play to policymakers. \u201cThis is a research and teaching role, not an advocacy role. We don\u2019t know what the impact of play is on particular outcomes. We\u2019re going into this to investigate it.\u201d \n \n And Stjerne Thomsen says: \u201cWe hope the Lego professor will speak to the needs that exist in education right now \u2013 and we can point to what the attitudes to play are, how teachers teach and what parents expect from education. New research studies may fulfill gaps in academia, but we help our academic partners to address the question of how it would make sense for a government or teacher to use that research.\u201d \n \n The Lego Foundation chose Cambridge because of its interdisciplinary approach to play research and its expertise and credibility when communicating research to policymakers and practitioners, he says. \u201cThere is no department of play at any university and no institution takes responsibility for following the play literature and looking at interventions and outcomes in education. There is a lot of work even at the baseline for an academic institution to say what studies already exist and it\u2019s very difficult to set up good studies.\u201d \n \n Academics have under-researched the potential value of play because the line between play, teaching and learning is hard to pin down, Vignoles says. \u201cUsing the latest technology to carry out research and collect data will be important. One of the most exciting projects the centre is working on at the moment is looking at outdoor play using GPS technology. The aim is to understand how children interact with their peers when they\u2019re left in a playground situation, and how they congregate in groups and play. It\u2019s an innovative way of studying what children are doing.\u201d \n \n It is the first professor of play in the world. \u201cIt needed to be a professorship because we have high expectations with regard to the standard of the research agenda,\u201d says Stjerne Thomsen. \u201cWe wanted to attract someone who will build a whole team around him or her that can define studies in this area, someone who will be world-renowned for play.\u201d \n \n Applicants do not need to already hold a professorship. \u201cThere may be people applying for this post for whom this will be their first chair \u2013 it\u2019s more about what they can bring in terms of their research,\u201d says Vignoles.

    "document": "One of two nuclear bombs that fell near Raleigh, N.C., during a military accident more than 50 years ago came frighteningly close to detonating, newly-released documents reveal. \n \n It has long been known that a pair of 4-megaton hydrogen bombs fell from a stricken B-52 as it broke apart over Goldsboro, N.C., on Jan 24, 1961, at the height of the Cold War. But documents just released by the National Security Archive show that one bomb's arming mechanism switched from \"safe\" to \"armed\" on impact, while the other bomb fluttered under a parachute and would have exploded in the sky if two cockpit wires had happened to touch as the plane disintegrated. \n \n \"This bomb had the potential to make the one used in Hiroshima look like the work of a cap gun,\" said Eric Schlosser, who obtained the documents approximately a year before they were obtained by the National Security Archive at George Washington University. \n \n \"It behaved as though it was dropped over the Soviet Union at the time.\" - Eric Schlosser, author of book on \"The Goldsboro Incident\" \n \n Schlosser, who wrote about the incident in his 2013 book, \"Command and Control: Nuclear Weapons, the Damascus Accident, and the Illusion of Safety,\" said the bomb brought to Earth by parachute, dubbed \"Weapon I,\" was actually the one that came closest to detonating, even though its arming mechanism remained on \"safe.\" The explosive performed just as a nuclear weapon is designed to function in wartime, completing five of the six steps to detonation, and only a single low-voltage switch prevented the explosion. \n \n \"It behaved as though it was dropped over the Soviet Union at the time,\" Schlosser said. \n \n Other experts agree. \n \n \"When the B-52 disintegrates in the air it is likely to release the bombs in a near normal fashion,\" wrote Parker Jones, who analyzed the incident at the time for the Sandia National Laboratories and wrote a report entitled \"How I learned to mistrust the H-Bomb.\" \n \n As it turned out, the bomb that fell to the ground at 700 miles per hour did the most damage, burrowing some 12 feet into the ground. Unlike the other bomb, it was never in danger of detonating despite the impact moving its arming mechanism to the \"armed\" position. Jack ReVelle, who was an Air Force weapons disposal specialist in charge of disarming the two 11 1/2 -feet bombs, remembered when his men reported seeing the switching device as they dug their way down into the crater formed on impact. \n \n \u201cUntil my death I will never forget hearing my sergeant say, \u2018Lieutenant, we found the arm/safe switch,\u2019\u201d ReVelle told students at East Carolina University in 2013. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Great.\u2019 He said, \u2018Not great. It\u2019s on arm.\u201d \n \n The fact that the arming mechanism on the second weapon moved on impact prompted the military to order new switches immediately. \n \n \u201cSo even though weapon 2 was further from detonation, the fact that the switch used to arm the weapon could be altered by an impact, shows its safety shortcoming,\u201d William Burr, an analyst from the National Security Archive said. \n \n The B-52 had been on a routine 12-hour mission and suddenly lost 19 tons of fuel pressure within minutes, according to local reports. The pilot was able to straighten the plane at 10,000 feet and aimed it for nearby Seymour Johnson Air Force Base until its right wing broke off. One witness described the plane as streaking through the sky like a Roman candle. \n \n The pilots survived, and no one was killed on the ground. But had either bomb detonated, history would have been made in the worst possible way. \n \n \"It would have created a crater eight football fields wide,\" ReVelle said. \"It would have destroyed every structure within a four-mile radius. There would have been a 100-percent kill zone for eight and a half miles in every direction.\" ||||| In a scenario that could\u2019ve been extremely devastating, the United States narrowly averted a nuclear disaster in 1961 when an atomic bomb nearly detonated after falling out of a B-52 bomber that broke up in the sky. \n \n According to the Washington Post, the incident took place on January 21, 1961 \u2013 less than 20 years after nuclear bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki \u2013 and is explained further in a recently declassified report published by the National Security Archives. \n \n When the US Air Force aircraft went into a tailspin and broke up, the two bombs fell towards Goldsboro, North Carolina. The parachute for one of the weapons failed to deploy, and the plane crash had actually pushed the bomb into \u201carmed\u201d mode by the time it hit the ground. Luckily for North Carolina, the plane\u2019s destruction also damaged the switch necessary to trigger detonation \n \n \u201cThe report implied that because Weapon 2 landed in a free-fall, without the parachute operating, the timer did not initiate the bomb\u2019s high voltage battery (\u201ctrajectory arming\u201d), a step in the arming sequence,\u201d wrote Bill Burr of the National Security Archives. \n \n \u201cFor Weapon 2, the Arm/Safe switch was in the \u201csafe\u201d position, yet it was virtually armed because the impact shock had rotated the indicator drum to the \u201carmed\u201d position. But the shock also damaged the switch contacts, which had to be intact for the weapon to detonate.\u201d \n \n Burr noted in his report just how fine the line was and is between safety and destruction. \n \n \u201cPerhaps this is what Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara had in mind, a few years later, when he observed that, \u2018by the slightest margin of chance, literally the failure of two wires to cross, a nuclear explosion was averted,\u201d he wrote. \n \n These details are just the latest to surface about the incident, which was first revealed by nuclear weapons expert Eric Schlosser last year in a book titled, \u201cCommand and Control.\u201d Through a Freedom of Information Act request, Schlosser was able to obtain documentation regarding the incident for the first time, and helped shed light on just how close the Air Force came to witnessing an atomic bomb explode on US soil. \n \n As RT reported last year, the documents revealed that three of the four safety switches on the other bomb failed to work properly, meaning, as Schlosser noted, that only \"one simple, dynamo-technology, low voltage switch stood between the United States and a major catastrophe.\u201d The parachute on this one deployed, but when the bomb struck the ground the final firing signal triggered, only to be halted by that fourth safety switch. \n \n The bombs contained a payload of four megatons each and could have generated explosions 260 times more powerful than the one that occurred in Hiroshima. \n \n Before the documents related to the Goldsboro incident surfaced, the US government had denied that its nuclear weapons stockpile had ever put the nation at risk. \n \n \u201cThe US government has consistently tried to withhold information from the American people in order to prevent questions being asked about our nuclear weapons policy,\u201d Schlosser told the Guardian. \u201cWe were told there was no possibility of these weapons accidentally detonating, yet here\u2019s one that very nearly did.\u201d ||||| Story highlights Goldsboro one of 32 pre-1980 accidents involving nukes \n \n Weeks after Goldsboro, there was another close call in California \n \n The weapons came alarmingly close to detonation \n \n They were far more powerful than the bombs dropped in Japan \n \n On a January night in 1961, a U.S. Air Force bomber broke in half while flying over eastern North Carolina. From the belly of the B-52 fell two bombs -- two nuclear bombs that hit the ground near the city of Goldsboro. \n \n A disaster worse than the devastation wrought in Hiroshima and Nagasaki could have befallen the United States that night. But it didn't, thanks to a series of fortunate missteps. \n \n Declassified documents that the National Security Archive released this week offered new details about the incident. The blaring headline read : \"Multi-Megaton Bomb Was Virtually 'Armed' When It Crashed to Earth.\" \n \n Or, as Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara put it back then, \"By the slightest margin of chance, literally the failure of two wires to cross, a nuclear explosion was averted.\" \n \n It's difficult to calculate the destruction those bombs might have caused had they detonated in North Carolina. \n \n A mushroom cloud rises above Nagasaki, Japan, on August 9, 1945, after an atomic bomb was dropped on the city. The bombing by American forces ended the second world war. \n \n A picture taken in 1971 shows a nuclear explosion in Mururoa atoll. \n \n What might've been \n \n The website, nuclearsecrecy.com , allows users to simulate nuclear explosions. It says that one bomb the size of the two that fell in 1961 would emit thermal radiation over a 15-mile radius. Wind conditions, of course, could change that. \n \n The blast today, with populations in the area at their current level, would kill more than 60,000 people and injure more 54,000, though the website warns that calculating casualties is problematic, and the numbers do not include those killed and injured by fallout. \n \n It's also worth noting that North Carolina's 1961 total population was 47% of what it is today, so if you apply that percentage to the numbers, the death toll is 28,000 with 26,000 people injured -- a far cry from those killed by smaller bombs on the more densely populated cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. \n \n University of California-Los Angeles researchers estimate that, respectively, Hiroshima and Nagasaki had populations of about 330,000 and 250,000 when they were bombed in August 1945. By that December, the cities' death tolls included, by conservative estimates , at least 90,000 and 60,000 people. \n \n Wayne County, North Carolina, which includes Goldsboro, had a population of about 84,000 in 1961. The state capital, Raleigh, is 50 miles northwest of Goldsboro, and Fayetteville -- home of the Army's massive Fort Bragg -- is 60 miles southwest. \n \n The Goldsboro incident \n \n The B-52 was flying over North Carolina on January 24, 1961, when it suffered a \"failure of the right wing,\" the report said. \n \n As the plane broke apart, the two bombs plummeted toward the ground. The parachute opened on one; it didn't on the other. \n \n \"The impact of the aircraft breakup initiated the fuzing sequence for both bombs,\" the summary of the documents said. \n \n In other words, both weapons came alarmingly close to detonating. \n \n Weapon 1, the bomb whose parachute opened, landed intact. Fortunately, the safing pins that provided power from a generator to the weapon had been yanked -- preventing it from going off. \n \n Weapon 2, the second bomb with the unopened parachute, landed in a free fall. The impact of the crash put it in the \"armed\" setting. Fortunately -- once again -- it damaged another part of the bomb needed to initiate an explosion. \n \n While it's unclear how frequently these types of accidents have occurred, the Defense Department has disclosed 32 accidents involving nuclear weapons between 1950 and 1980. \n \n There are at least 21 declassified accounts between 1950 and 1968 of aircraft-related incidents in which nuclear weapons were lost, accidentally dropped, jettisoned for safety reasons or on board planes that crashed. The accidents occurred in various U.S. states, Greenland, Spain, Morocco and England, and over the Pacific and Atlantic oceans and the Mediterranean Sea. \n \n Another five accidents occurred when planes were taxiing or parked. \n \n Two months after the close call in Goldsboro, another B-52 was flying in the western United States when the cabin depressurized and the crew ejected, leaving the pilot to steer the bomber away from populated areas, according to a DOD document . The plane crashed in Yuba City, California, but safety devices prevented the two onboard nuclear weapons from detonating. \n \n Catastrophe averted \n \n The Goldsboro incident was first detailed last year in the book \" Command and Control \" by Eric Schlosser. The documents released this week provided additional chilling details. \n \n Eight crew members were aboard the plane that night. Five survived the crash. \n \n \"I could see three or four other chutes against the glow of the wreckage,\" recounted the co-pilot, Maj. Richard Rardin, according to an account published by the University of North Carolina \n \n \"I hit some trees. I had a fix on some lights and started walking.\" \n \n The MK39 bombs weighed 10,000 pounds and their explosive yield was 3.8 megatons. Compare that to the bombs dropped in Hiroshima and Nagasaki: They were 0.01 and 0.02 megatons. \n \n But Rardin didn't know then what a catastrophe had been avoided. \n \n \"My biggest difficulty getting back was the various and sundry dogs I encountered on the road.\"",

Reid / Kitsap Sun) \n \n BAINBRIDGE ISLAND \u2013 The waterbed was just a concept in a San Francisco art gallery, and Charles Hall was just a young graduate student floating an idea back in 1968. \n \n Half a century, a popular subculture icon and a successful design career later, Hall wakes up on his most famous design each morning with a million-dollar view of Puget Sound and downtown Seattle. \n \n Today he's taking another go at the waterbed, hoping it's on the verge of a comeback. \n \n Hall, now a resident of Bainbridge Island, plans to launch a redesigned waterbed later this year. It\u2019s a rethink of his original design from 50 years ago that removes all its negative aspects and keeps its positives, he said. \n \n Gone is the wooden frame that made the older beds so hard to get out of, exchanged for a foam collar that surrounds the water bladder. Spandex covers the top of the mattress to give a floating sensation. A fiber insert quells waves and keeps the water bladder still. An updated temperature system keeps the water feeling just right. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a better experience all around,\u201d Hall said. \n \n His famous bed first launched on the West Coast all those years ago, but his new bed will launch across the country on its eastern shore. The bed will first go to a test market in a chain of Florida furniture stores later this spring or summer, before it hopefully rolls out more broadly, he said. A bed-in-a-box version you can set up yourself might also go up for sale online, Hall said. \n \n Queen- and king-sized mattresses will be available, and a complete bed system will sell for about $2,000, he said. \n \n Fifty years ago, Hall\u2019s original concept began as a chair filled with a viscous cooking starch. The chair weighed about 300 pounds, the starch didn\u2019t flow well and it was difficult to get out of, Hall said, so he abandoned the idea in favor of the bed that would launch his design career. \n \n The idea was that it would offer better support and a temperature system that would approximate the body\u2019s skin temperature to help a person relax and get better sleep, he said. \n \n \u201cA waterbed is about as pure a concept as you can get,\u201d Hall said. \u201cYour body is 90-some-percent water anyway, what you\u2019re doing in an environment before you\u2019re born is water.\u201d \n \n \n \n While he was touting its practical benefits, the undulating bed took off for other reasons amid the counterculture movement and sexual revolution of the 1970s. Sellers and buyers saw a sensuous appeal: Phrases like \u201cPleasure is a waterbed\u201d and \u201cTwo things are better on a waterbed \u2013 one of them is sleep\u201d began to show up on advertisements. \n \n \u201cThe sexy part drove it for quite awhile,\u201d Hall said. \u201cPeople would look at it and they\u2019d see this wiggle and they\u2019d say, \u2018Ooh, that\u2019s going to be great for sex.\u2019 That sold an awful lot of waterbeds. Then when people slept on them, they said, \u2018Hey, that\u2019s actually comfortable.\u2019\u201d \n \n He laments how his product has been portrayed in movies and TV shows, where they\u2019d always seem to be a joke, exploding or springing a leak. The sloshing got people\u2019s attention, but it was just a sideshow, Hall said. \n \n Waterbeds reached their heyday in the 1980s before sales tapered off. Hall moved on to other design projects, like inflatable kayaks and a solar-heated shower for campers, he said, but returned to the concept in recent years with a few tweaks. \n \n His friend, who runs the City Furniture chain in Florida that will initially carry the new beds, feels like it\u2019s an idea whose time has come again, Hall said. \n \n \u201cI think that some people will have a memory of it and want to revisit it just because they remember waterbeds and want to see how different they are,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAnd then there\u2019ll be a generation, it\u2019ll be a total novelty for them.\u201d \n \n \u00a9 2018 KING-TV ||||| Ready for the return of waterbeds? Charlie Hall, the Bainbridge Island inventor of them, has a comeback planned 50 years after their debut. And he\u2019s looking at you, millennials, to get groovy. \n \n Millennials, the inventor of the waterbed has a message for you. Especially those of you living right here in the Pacific Northwest, like he does. \n \n You need a waterbed. \n \n Charlie Hall is 71 and a millionaire because of waterbeds and some of the other 40 patents he holds. (You know the Sun Shower, with the solar-heated bags that let you bathe when camping? That\u2019s his.) \n \n He\u2019s planning on the waterbed making a comeback this spring. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think a millennial has ever seen one,\u201d says Charlie, as everyone calls him, about the invention he debuted 50 years ago at a \u201cHappy Happening\u201d art show in San Francisco. \n \n \u201cBut I have this theory that it\u2019s a Northwest kind of thing. I feel like a lot of us spawned in a waterbed.\u201d \n \n And so those younger types, \u201cMaybe they want to visit the spawning ground.\u201d \n \n That first waterbed was called \u201cThe Pleasure Pit\u201d because, as the oft-repeated sales pitch went in that groovy era, \u201cTwo things are better on a waterbed, and one of them is sleeping.\u201d \n \n Working with a good friend of his from the waterbed days \u2014 Keith Koening, president of City Furniture, with 16 stores in South Florida \u2014 he is about to test-market Waterbed 2018. \n \n No more rigid frame that made them hard to get out of. Now there\u2019s foam around the edges. New materials suppress the wave action that some customers didn\u2019t like. Dual bladders allow each side of the bed to have its own temperature control. \n \n It\u2019s not like Charlie needs the money from the Return of the Waterbed. \n \n He has a ranch home in California wine country and another place in that state, and about 15 years ago he bought a home right on the Bainbridge Island waterfront. Looking out through the big windows, he has a straight-on, unobstructed view of downtown Seattle. During nice weather, he spends a lot of time on his 55-foot cruiser, going around the San Juans. \n \n Still, he\u2019s an inveterate tinkerer. He can\u2019t help it. \n \n That Sun Shower is part of the catalog for Advanced Elements, of which he\u2019s co-founder, although these days not involved in the day-to-day operations. \n \n \u201cIt keeps me young, to be active and engaged in a lot of projects,\u201d says Charlie. \n \n But are we ready for Waterbeds 2.0? \n \n If history is to repeat, once again it\u2019ll be that male customer who\u2019ll plunk down the cash. \n \n The ads back then sometimes featured women in slinky outfits, or no outfits at all. \n \n By May 1970, Charlie Hall\u2019s waterbed was featured in a Playboy magazine spread, in an issue that included a story on \u201cThe Fiery Feminists\u201d and \u201cAn exclusive interview with William F. Buckley Jr.\u201d \n \n \u201cI remember we had to do the bed in velvet, I think maybe green velvet,\u201d remembers Charlie. \n \n Subtlety was not part of the waterbed ethos back then. \n \n Some came in gargantuan, four-poster wood frames such as a \u201cJungle Bed\u201d advertised in June 1976 in The Seattle Times for a special sale price of $450, which is $1,953 in today\u2019s dollars. \n \n For Charlie Hall, it\u2019s a long way from his days as a 24-year-old industrial design student at San Francisco State University doing his graduate school thesis. \n \n \u201cI always liked furniture and I wanted to address human comfort. I talked to doctors, physical therapists, even some psychiatrists, trying to put together elements of comfort that work,\u201d he says. \n \n For example, there are whirlpool baths taken by athletes \u2014 \u201cletting your muscles relax, that soothing sensation associated with floating,\u201d says Charlie. \n \n From that came his first effort, a chair filled with a kind of viscous starch. \n \n \u201cIt was not practical. It weighed 300 pounds, and you couldn\u2019t move it unless you had a forklift. And you kept sinking deeper and deeper into it until it was hard to get out of,\u201d remembers Charlie. \u201cI also decided that a bed was more important. It\u2019s the piece of furniture used most in the house.\u201d \n \n Then he had the epiphany of using water inside a vinyl bladder, made for him by a company specializing in PVC. \n \n Charlie got an \u201cA\u201d on his thesis, and the waterbed revolution was on. Although it didn\u2019t magically take off. \n \n \u201cWe had a little shop in Sausalito, and we would deliver them on top of a Rambler station wagon,\u201d says Charlie. \n \n One of his customers liked the beds so much he helped raise $100,000 in funding. Celebrities began to notice the new fad. \n \n \u201cOne of the Smothers Brothers bought one, and somebody in Jefferson Airplane bought one. I remember we delivered that one to a big Victorian house that was painted all black. Getting the bed in there was hell,\u201d says Charlie. \n \n On June 15, 1971, he was granted U.S. Patent No. 3,585,356 A for a \u201cLiquid Support for Human Bodies,\u201d the waterbed. \n \n That didn\u2019t deter the copycats, who ignored his requests for royalties or licensing fees. \n \n It wouldn\u2019t be until 1991 that Charlie was vindicated when a jury awarded him $6 million in a patent-infringement lawsuit against Intex Plastics, a company that imported waterbeds from Taiwan. He then began receiving licensing fees. \n \n The waterbed craze lasted for nearly 20 years. \n \n A 1986 New York Times story quoted the Waterbed Manufacturers Association as saying they accounted for 12 percent to 15 percent of the American bedding market, and that back then they had $1.9 billion ($4.3 billion in today\u2019s dollars) in annual sales. \n \n They were so popular that the California Civil Code says landlords can\u2019t discriminate against people with waterbeds, as long as they have waterbed insurance. In Seattle there is no waterbed legislation, although some rental agreements either prohibit waterbeds or require proof of insurance. \n \n Then waterbeds practically disappeared. \n \n \u201cProbably bad marketing,\u201d says Charlie. \u201cIt got to be price wars. Retailers were presenting $99 specials and selling a very crappy product. It spiraled down from there.\u201d \n \n Sometimes, he says, what was sold to college kids was just the bladder \u2014 no frame. \u201cYou can imagine a bag of water on a college dorm floor. Not a good idea,\u201d he says. \n \n Charlie says that there also were a lot of myths associated with waterbeds. \n \n Like they were so heavy that they crashed through the floor. No, he explains, \u201cForty pounds per square foot is a normal building load on a residential floor. Waterbeds don\u2019t even come close. It\u2019d be a third or less.\u201d \n \n Or, they\u2019d leak all over the place. No, says Charlie, \u201cThey have safety liners that take care of any leak issues.\u201d \n \n He does say that it was because of waterbeds that the mattress industry changed. It showed you didn\u2019t have to settle for some rigid spring coil bed. \n \n \u201cMemory foam, pillowtop mattresses, all that stuff began to appear,\u201d he says. \u201cLook at the ads for the memory foams \u2014 they read like all waterbed ads.\u201d \n \n Now it\u2019s a new day. \n \n Fifty years later, don\u2019t you think this could fit you, too? \n \n Seattle Times, June 8, 1978, in a feature about waterbeds: \n \n \u201c \u2026 the avant-garde youth took to them like protest marches.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Waterbeds were all the rage back in the 1970s before all but disappearing the following decade. Now the original inventor plans a big comeback in the new millennium. Fittingly, he sees millennials as the key to that revival, reports the Seattle Times. \u201cI don\u2019t think a millennial has ever seen one,\u201d 71-year-old Charlie Hall tells the newspaper. Hall is betting that a slew of improvements\u2014temperature control, calmer waves, etc.\u2014will once again make the beds a must-have for the younger generation when they hit the market later this year, initally at the City Furniture chain in Florida. King- and queen-sized mattresses will be available, and those looking to indulge can expect to pay about $2,000, reports KREM2. \u201cI think that some people will have a memory of it and want to revisit it just because they remember waterbeds and want to see how different they are,\u201d says Hall. \u201cAnd then there\u2019ll be a generation, it\u2019ll be a total novelty for them.\u201d Both stories recount the colorful history and risque marketing that helped make the original waterbeds popular 50 years ago.

    "document": "Homecoming \n \n An American guerilla fighter fought alongside Castro during the revolution, but then he grew disillusioned and was executed. Now, his widow fights to bring his body home. \n \n Every day for more than a decade, Olga Goodwin has whispered the same prayer: \u201cPlease God, bring my husband home.\u201d \n \n Her husband was William Morgan, a charismatic American guerrilla who fought with Cuban leader Fidel Castro during the Cuban Revolution. Known as the \u201cYankee Comandante,\u201d Morgan fell out of favor with Castro and Ernesto \u201cChe\u201d Guevara after the revolution and was executed. His body was placed in an unmarked grave in Havana. \n \n For more than a decade, Goodwin has tried to get Morgan\u2019s remains returned from Cuba to his native Ohio for reburial. But now, the tussle over one of the last relics of the Cold War could be ending, as relations between the U.S. and Cuba thaw. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re more optimistic because of the recent developments with Cuba,\u201d said Toledo attorney Opie Rollison. \n \n Rollison points to the release of Alan Gross, an American aid worker accused of being a spy, and three Cubans members of the \u201cCuban Five\u201d who were convicted in 2001 of espionage related charges. Morgan\u2019s body could be next. Rollison declined to offer details about current discussions with the Cuban government. Calls and emails to the Cuban Interests Section in Washington were not answered. \n \n \u201cHis mother and wife wanted him buried next to his family in Toledo, Ohio and we\u2019re trying to honor that wish,\u201d said Rollison, who successfully got Morgan\u2019s citizenship restored in April 2007. \n \n For years, Morgan was just a historical footnote. But his profile has been on the rise of late. A new book written by Pulitzer Prize winners Mike Sallah and Mitch Weiss, The Yankee Comandante: The Untold Story of Courage, Passion, and One American\u2019s Fight to Liberate Cuba, is the latest look at Morgan\u2019s life and his role in the formation of modern Cuba. \n \n \u201cThis was a guy who was a pivotal player in the Cold War between Cuba, the United States and the Soviet Union,\u201d said Sallah. \u201cIn the end, he was a ne\u2019er-do-well who found his cause, his love and his redemption in Cuba. He became something he never was in America. He becomes a hero in Cuba.\u201d \n \n In 2012, David Grann published a story about Morgan in the New Yorker magazine. George Clooney optioned Grann\u2019s story for a possible movie and PBS\u2019 American Experience will cover Morgan\u2019s life later this year. \n \n \u201cMorgan was \u2018like Holden Caulfield with a machine gun,\u2019\u201d Grann wrote in the New Yorker. \u201cHe was the only American in the rebel army and the sole foreigner, other than (Che) Guevara, an Argentine, to rise to the army\u2019s highest rank, comandante. \u201c \n \n It is easy to see why Morgan\u2019s life has attracted so much attention. It plays out like a movie. He was an ex-paratrooper and high school dropout. He worked as an enforcer for the mob before abandoning his life in 1957 to join Cuban fighters fighting Fulgencio Batista. In photos, Morgan cut a dashing figure with a thick beard and broad shoulders. While fighting in Cuba, Morgan met then Olga Rodriguez and married her. Their love story is at the center of Yankee Comandante. \n \n Morgan teased Goodwin about her haircut when they first met and they used to eat rice and beans at night in the guerrilla camp. They would cling to one another during bombing raids. In one famous picture, Morgan and Goodwin are captured in a bit of bliss as they stand together in the mountains. Morgan has a rifle resting on his right shoulder and his left arm is over Goodwin\u2019s shoulder. They are looking at each other with loving smiles. \n \n \u201cShe inspired him,\u201d Sallah said. \u201cHe had never met a woman like her. Olga becomes his driving force through the rest of his life.\u201d \n \n His devotion is evident in a farewell letter Morgan wrote just before he died. \n \n \u201cSince the first time I saw you in the mountains until the last time I saw you in prison, you have been my love, my happiness, my companion in life and in my thoughts during my moment of death,\u201d he wrote. \n \n Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

Morgan\u2019s group supported a Democratic form of government, while Castro began tilting toward the Soviet Union. When Castro canceled elections, seized properties, and imprisoned Morgan\u2019s fellow freedom fighters, Morgan decided to take action. He began stockpiling guns to launch a counterrevolution in the Escambry. But he was betrayed by one of his men and executed by firing squad at the notorious La Cabana prison in March 1961. \n \n Even his death was something out of the movies. Morgan gave his rosary to a priest, asking the man to return it to his mother in Ohio. When his executioners told him to kneel, Morgan reportedly said: \u201cI kneel for no man.\u201d \n \n The firing squad shot out his knees before killing him as he lay on the ground. \n \n \u201cOnce he died, much larger events eclipsed his story,\u201d Sallah said. \u201cHe kind of got lost in history.\u201d \n \n As Yankee Comandante illustrates, the story of Morgan\u2019s wife, Olga Goodwin, is just as compelling. After fighting alongside Morgan, she spent more than a decade in prison after her husband\u2019s death. Much of her sentence was spent in solitary confinement with a hole in the floor for a latrine, according to Sallah. She suffers migraines after being struck with a rubber club in the head. Food was scarce in prison and she received one small cup of water to wash. \n \n \u201cWe prayed a lot,\u201d Goodwin said told the Toledo Blade when asked how she survived. \n \n She was only 79 pounds when she was released from prison in 1972, according to the Blade. Goodwin escaped Cuba during the Mariel boatlift in 1980. Castro emptied his jails and allowed boats to pick up passengers, including the prisoners, and take them to the United States. About 125,000 Cuban refugees left for south Florida. \n \n Landing in Florida, she made her way north to Toledo, Morgan\u2019s hometown. Goodwin promised Morgan\u2019s mother that she\u2019d get his remains back to the town he loved. She has since remarried, but she hasn\u2019t given up on her promise. Getting his body back would finally repay him for sacrificing his life to liberate her country. \n \n \u201cFor me, he is a hero,\u201d Goodwin said in a phone interview from Toledo. \u201cFor the Cuban people, he is a hero. He gave his life for my country. I promised I would do this.\u201d \n \n The Cuban government erased him from its history after a brief service was held for Morgan in Havana\u2019s Colon Cemetery in 1961. But a series written by Sallah in the Blade in 2002 prompted U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat that represents Toledo, to travel to Cuba to plead for the remains. Castro agreed to release the body, but it is unclear how the deal fell through, Sallah said. \n \n Kaptur\u2019s office declined to comment on the congresswoman\u2019s work to secure the remains. Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, has also helped Goodwin. His office has been in contact with the State Department and is pursuing all diplomatic options to recover the remains. \n \n \u201cFor too long, the Cuban government has stood between an Ohio woman and her husband\u2019s remains,\u201d said Meghan Dubyak, Brown\u2019s spokeswoman. \n \n The return of Morgan\u2019s remains will fulfill a widow\u2019s promise and also close the book on the life of an American patriot, Sallah said. ||||| For a moment, he was obscured by the Havana night. It was as if he were invisible, as he had been before coming to Cuba, in the midst of revolution. Then a burst of floodlights illuminated him: William Alexander Morgan, the great Yankee comandante. He was standing, with his back against a bullet-pocked wall, in an empty moat surrounding La Caba\u00f1a\u2014an eighteenth-century stone fortress, on a cliff overlooking Havana Harbor, that had been converted into a prison. Flecks of blood were drying on the patch of ground where Morgan\u2019s friend had been shot, moments earlier. Morgan, who was thirty-two, blinked into the lights. He faced a firing squad. The gunmen gazed at the man they had been ordered to kill. Morgan was nearly six feet tall, and had the powerful arms and legs of someone who had survived in the wild. With a stark jaw, a pugnacious nose, and scruffy blond hair, he had the gallant look of an adventurer in a movie serial, of a throwback to an earlier age, and photographs of him had appeared in newspapers and magazines around the world. The most alluring images\u2014taken when he was fighting in the mountains, with Fidel Castro and Che Guevara\u2014showed Morgan, with an untamed beard, holding a Thompson submachine gun. Though he was now shaved and wearing prison garb, the executioners recognized him as the mysterious Americano who once had been hailed as a hero of the revolution. It was March 11, 1961, two years after Morgan had helped to overthrow the dictator Fulgencio Batista, bringing Castro to power. The revolution had since fractured, its leaders devouring their own, like Saturn, but the sight of Morgan before a firing squad was a shock. In 1957, when Castro was still widely seen as fighting for democracy, Morgan had travelled from Florida to Cuba and headed into the jungle, joining a guerrilla force. In the words of one observer, Morgan was \u201clike Holden Caulfield with a machine gun.\u201d He was the only American in the rebel army and the sole foreigner, other than Guevara, an Argentine, to rise to the army\u2019s highest rank, comandante. After the revolution, Morgan\u2019s role in Cuba aroused even greater fascination, as the island became enmeshed in the larger battle of the Cold War. An American who knew Morgan said that he had served as Castro\u2019s \u201cchief cloak-and-dagger man,\u201d and Time called him Castro\u2019s \u201ccrafty, U.S.-born double agent.\u201d Now Morgan was charged with conspiring to overthrow Castro. The Cuban government claimed that Morgan had actually been working for U.S. intelligence\u2014that he was, in effect, a triple agent. Morgan denied the allegations, but even some of his friends wondered who he really was, and why he had come to Cuba. Before Morgan was led outside La Caba\u00f1a, an inmate asked him if there was anything he could do for him. Morgan replied, \u201cIf you ever get out of here alive, which I doubt you will, try to tell people my story.\u201d Morgan grasped that more than his life was at stake: the Cuban regime would distort his role in the revolution, if not excise it from the public record, and the U.S. government would stash documents about him in classified files, or \u201csanitize\u201d them by concealing passages with black ink. He would be rubbed out\u2014first from the present, then from the past. The head of the firing squad shouted, \u201cAttention!\u201d The gunmen raised their Belgian rifles. Morgan feared for his wife, Olga\u2014whom he had met in the mountains\u2014and for their two young daughters. He had always managed to bend the forces of history, and he had made a last-minute plea to communicate with Castro. Morgan had believed that the man he once called his \u201cfaithful friend\u201d would never kill him. But now the executioners were cocking their guns. THE FIRST TRICK \n \n When Morgan arrived in Havana, in December, 1957, he was propelled by the thrill of a secret. He made sure that he wasn\u2019t being followed as he moved surreptitiously through the neon-lit capital. Advertised as the \u201cPlayland of the Americas,\u201d Havana offered one temptation after another: the Sans Souci night club, where, on outdoor stages, dancers with frank hips swayed under the stars to the cha-cha; the Hotel Capri, whose slot machines spat out American silver dollars; and the Tropicana, where guests such as Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando enjoyed lavish revues featuring the Diosas de Carne, or \u201cflesh goddesses.\u201d Morgan, then a pudgy twenty-nine-year-old, tried to appear as just another man of leisure. He wore a two-hundred-and-fifty-dollar white suit with a white shirt, and a new pair of shoes. \u201cI looked like a real fat-cat tourist,\u201d he later joked. But, according to members of Morgan\u2019s inner circle, and to the unpublished account of a close friend, he avoided the glare of the city\u2019s night life, making his way along a street in Old Havana, near a wharf that offered a view of La Caba\u00f1a, with its drawbridge and moss-covered walls. Morgan paused by a telephone booth, where he encountered a Cuban contact named Roger Rodr\u00edguez. A raven-haired student radical with a thick mustache, Rodr\u00edguez had once been shot by police during a political demonstration, and he was a member of a revolutionary cell. Most tourists remained oblivious of the many iniquities of Cuba, where people often lived without electricity or running water. Graham Greene, who published \u201cOur Man in Havana\u201d in 1958, later recalled, \u201cI enjoyed the louche atmosphere of Batista\u2019s city and I never stayed long enough to become aware of the sad political background of arbitrary imprisonment and torture.\u201d Morgan, however, had briefed himself on Batista, who had seized power in a coup, in 1952: how the dictator liked sitting in his palace, eating sumptuous meals and watching horror films, and how he tortured and killed dissidents, whose bodies were sometimes dumped in fields, with their eyes gouged out or their crushed testicles stuffed in their mouths. Morgan and Rodr\u00edguez resumed walking through Old Havana, and began a furtive conversation. Morgan was rarely without a cigarette, and typically communicated through a haze of smoke. He didn\u2019t know Spanish, but Rodr\u00edguez spoke broken English. They had previously met in Miami, becoming friends, and Morgan believed that he could trust him. Morgan confided that he planned to sneak into the Sierra Maestra, a mountain range on Cuba\u2019s remote southeastern coast, where revolutionaries had taken up arms against the regime. He intended to enlist with the rebels, who were commanded by Fidel Castro. The name of Batista\u2019s mortal enemy carried the jolt of the forbidden. On November 25, 1956, Castro, a thirty-year-old lawyer and the illegitimate son of a prosperous landowner, had launched from Mexico an amphibious invasion of Cuba, along with eighty-one self-styled commandos, including Che Guevara. After their battered wooden ship ran aground, Castro and his men waded through chest-deep waters, and came ashore in a swamp whose tangled vegetation tore their skin. Batista\u2019s Army soon ambushed them, and Guevara was shot in the neck. (He later wrote, \u201cI immediately began to wonder what would be the best way to die, now that all seemed lost.\u201d) Only a dozen or so rebels, including the wounded Guevara and Castro\u2019s younger brother, Ra\u00fal, escaped, and, exhausted and delirious with thirst\u2014one drank his own urine\u2014they fled into the steep jungles of the Sierra Maestra. Morgan told Rodr\u00edguez that he had been tracking the progress of the uprising. After Batista mistakenly declared that Castro had died in the ambush, Castro allowed a Times correspondent, Herbert Matthews, to be escorted into the Sierra Maestra. A close friend of Ernest Hemingway, Matthews longed not merely to cover world-changing events but to make them, and he was captivated by the tall rebel leader, with his wild beard and burning cigar. \u201cThe personality of the man is overpowering,\u201d Matthews wrote. \u201cHere was an educated, dedicated fanatic, a man of ideals, of courage.\u201d Matthews concluded that Castro had \u201cstrong ideas of liberty, democracy, social justice, the need to restore the Constitution.\u201d On February 24, 1957, the story appeared on the paper\u2019s front page, intensifying the rebellion\u2019s romantic aura. Matthews later put it this way: \u201cA bell tolled in the jungles of the Sierra Maestra.\u201d Yet why would an American be willing to die for Cuba\u2019s revolution? When Rodr\u00edguez pressed Morgan, he indicated that he wanted to be both on the side of good and on the edge of danger, but he also wanted something else: revenge. Morgan said that he had an American buddy who had travelled to Havana and been killed by Batista\u2019s soldiers. Later, Morgan provided more details to others in Cuba: his friend, a man named Jack Turner, had been caught smuggling weapons to the rebels, and was \u201ctortured and tossed to the sharks by Batista.\u201d Morgan told Rodr\u00edguez that he had already made contact with another revolutionary, who had arranged to sneak him into the mountains. Rodr\u00edguez was taken aback: the supposed rebel was an agent of Batista\u2019s secret police. Rodr\u00edguez warned Morgan that he\u2019d fallen into a trap. Rodr\u00edguez, fearing for Morgan\u2019s life, offered to help him. He could not transport Morgan to the Sierra Maestra, but he could take him to the camp of a rebel group in the Escambray Mountains, which cut across the central part of the country. These guerrillas were opening a new front, and Castro welcomed them to the \u201ccommon struggle.\u201d Morgan set out with Rodr\u00edguez and a driver on the two-hundred-and-seventeen mile journey. As Aran Shetterly details in his incisive biography \u201cThe Americano\u201d (2007), the car soon arrived at a military roadblock. A soldier peered inside at Morgan in his gleaming suit, the only outfit that he seemed to own. Morgan knew what would happen if he were seized\u2014as Guevara said, \u201cin a revolution, one wins or dies\u201d\u2014and he had prepared a cover story, in which he was an American businessman on his way to see coffee plantations. After hearing the tale, the soldier let them pass, and Morgan and his conspirators roared up the road, up into the Escambray, where the air became cooler and thinner, and where the three-thousand-foot peaks had an eerie purple tint. Morgan was taken to a safe house to rest, then driven to a mountainside near the town of Banao. A peasant shepherded Morgan and Rodr\u00edguez through vines and banana leaves until they reached a remote clearing, flanked by steep slopes. The peasant made a birdlike sound, which rang through the forest and was reciprocated by a distant whistle. A sentry emerged, and Morgan and Rodr\u00edguez were led to a campsite strewn with water basins and hammocks and a few antiquated rifles. Morgan could count only thirty or so men, many of whom appeared barely out of high school and had the emaciated, straggly look of shipwreck survivors. The rebels regarded Morgan uncertainly. Max Lesnik, a Cuban journalist in charge of the organization\u2019s propaganda, soon met up with the group, and recalls wondering if Morgan was \u201csome kind of agent from the C.I.A.\u201d Since the Spanish-American War, the U.S. had often meddled in Cuban affairs, treating the island like a colony. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had blindly supported Batista\u2014believing that he would \u201cdeal with the Commies,\u201d as he put it to Vice-President Richard Nixon\u2014and the C.I.A. had activated operatives throughout the island. In 1954, in a classified report, an American general advised that if the U.S. was to survive the Cold War it needed to \u201clearn to subvert, sabotage, and destroy our enemies by more clever, more sophisticated, and more effective methods than those used against us.\u201d The C.I.A. went so far as to hire a renowned magician, John Mulholland, to teach operatives sleight of hand and misdirection. Mulholland produced two illustrated manuals, which referred to covert operations as \u201ctricks.\u201d As the C.I.A. tried to assess the threat to Batista, its operatives attempted to penetrate rebel forces in the mountains. Among other things, agents were believed to have recruited, or posed as, reporters. Mulholland advised operatives that \u201ceven more practice is needed to act a lie skillfully than is required to tell one.\u201d The rebels also had to be sure that Morgan was not a K.G.B. operative, or a mercenary working for Batista\u2019s military intelligence. In the Sierra Maestra, Castro had recently discovered that a peasant within his ranks was an Army informant. The peasant, after being summoned, dropped to his knees, begging that the revolution take care of his children. Then he was shot in the head. \n \n Morgan was now brought to see the commander of the rebel group, Eloy Guti\u00e9rrez Menoyo. Twenty-three years old, soft-spoken, and bone-thin, Menoyo had a long, handsome face that was shielded by dark spectacles and a beard, giving him the look of a fugitive. The C.I.A. later noted, in its file on him, that he was an intelligent, capable young man who would not break \u201cunder normal interrogating techniques.\u201d As a boy, Menoyo had emigrated from Spain\u2014a lisp was faintly present when he spoke Spanish\u2014and he had inherited his family\u2019s militant posture toward tyranny. His oldest brother had been killed, at the age of sixteen, fighting the Fascists during the Spanish Civil War. His other brother, who had also come to Cuba, had been gunned down while leading a doomed assault on Batista\u2019s palace, in 1957. Menoyo had identified the body at a Havana morgue before heading into the mountains. \u201cI wanted to continue the fight in my brother\u2019s name,\u201d he recalls. Through a translator, Morgan told Menoyo his story about wanting to avenge a buddy\u2019s death. Morgan said that he had served in the U.S. Army and was skilled in martial arts and hand-to-hand combat, and that he could train the inexperienced rebels in guerrilla warfare. There was more to fighting than shooting a rifle, Morgan argued; as he later said, with the right tactics they could put \u201cthe fear of God\u201d in the enemy. To demonstrate his prowess, Morgan borrowed a knife and flicked it at a tree at least twenty yards away. It hit the target so squarely that some rebels gasped. That evening, they argued over whether Morgan could stay. Morgan seemed simp\u00e1tico\u2014\u201clike a Cuban,\u201d as Lesnik puts it. But many rebels, fearing that he was an infiltrator, wanted to send Morgan back to Havana. The group\u2019s chief of intelligence, Roger Redondo, recalls, \u201cWe did everything possible to make him leave.\u201d During the next several days, they marched him endlessly up and down the mountainsides. Morgan was so fat, one rebel joked, that he had to be C.I.A. Morgan, famished and fatigued, repeatedly hollered a few Spanish words that he had learned, \u201cNo soy mulo\u201d\u2014\u201cI\u2019m not a mule!\u201d At one point, the rebels led him into a patch of prickly poisonous shrubs, which stung like wasps and caused his chest and face to become grievously inflamed. Morgan could no longer sleep at night. When he removed his sweaty white shirt, Redondo recalls, \u201cWe pitied him. He was so fair-skinned and had turned such an angry red.\u201d Morgan\u2019s body also offered clues to a violent past. He had burn marks on his right arm, and a nearly foot-long scar ran across his chest, suggesting that someone had slashed him with a knife. There was a tiny scar under his chin, another by his left eye, and several on his left foot. It was as if he had already suffered years of hardship in the jungle. Morgan endured whatever ordeal the rebels subjected him to, shedding thirty-five pounds along the way. He later wrote that he had become unrecognizable: \u201cI weigh only\u2014165 lbs and have a beard.\u201d Redondo says, \u201cThe gringo was tough, and the armed men of the Escambray came to admire his persistence.\u201d Several weeks after Morgan arrived, a lookout noticed something moving amid distant cedars and tropical plants. Using binoculars, he made out six men, in khaki uniforms and wide-brimmed hats, carrying Springfield rifles. A Batista Army patrol. Most of the rebels had never faced combat. Morgan later described them as \u201cdoctors, lawyers, farmers, chemists, boys, students, and old men banded together.\u201d The lookout sounded the alarm, and Menoyo ordered everyone to take up positions around the camp. The rebels were not to fire, Menoyo explained, unless he said so. Morgan crouched beside Menoyo, holding one of the few semi-automatic rifles. As the soldiers crept closer, a shot rang out. It was Morgan. Menoyo cursed under his breath as both sides began shooting. Bullets split trees in half, and a bitter-tasting fog of smoke drifted over the mountainside. The thunderous sounds of the guns made it nearly impossible to communicate. A Batista soldier was hit in the shoulder, a scarlet stain seeping through his uniform, and he tumbled down the mountain like a boulder. The commander of the Army patrol retrieved the wounded soldier and, along with the rest of his men, retreated into the wilderness, leaving a trail of blood. In the sudden quiet, Menoyo turned to Morgan and yelled, \u201cWhy the hell did you fire?\u201d Morgan, when he was told in English what Menoyo was saying, seemed baffled. \u201cI thought you said to shoot when I saw their eyes,\u201d he said. No one had translated Menoyo\u2019s original command. Morgan had made a mistake, but it had only hastened an inevitable battle. Menoyo told Morgan and the others to clear out: hundreds of Batista\u2019s soldiers would soon be upon them. The men stuffed their belongings into backpacks made from sugar sacks. Menoyo took with him a medallion that his mother had given him, depicting the Immaculate Conception. Morgan tucked away his own mementos: photographs of a young boy and a young girl. The rebels divided into two groups, and Morgan set out with Menoyo and twenty others, marching for more than a hundred miles through the mountains. They usually moved during the night, then, at dawn, found a sheltered spot and ate what little food they had, taking turns sleeping while sentries kept watch. Morgan, who called one of his semi-automatic rifles his ni\u00f1o, always kept a weapon nearby. As darkness returned, the men resumed marching, listening to the sounds of woodpeckers and barking dogs and their own exhausted breathing. Their bodies slackened from hunger, and beards covered their faces like jungle growth. When a nineteen-year-old rebel fell and broke his foot, Morgan supported him, making sure that he was not left behind. One morning during the march, a rebel was scrounging for food when he spotted about two hundred Batista soldiers in a nearby valley. The rebels faced annihilation. As panic spread, Morgan helped Menoyo devise a plan. They would prepare an ambush, hiding behind a series of large stones, in a U formation. It was critical, Morgan said, to leave an escape route. The rebels crouched behind the stones, feeling the warmth of the earth against their bodies, holding their rifles steady against their cheeks. Earlier, some of the young men had professed cheerful indifference to death, but their brio vanished as they confronted the prospect. Morgan braced himself for the fight. He had inserted himself into a foreign conflict, and now everything was at risk. His predicament was akin to that of Robert Jordan, the American protagonist of \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls,\u201d who, while aiding the Republicans in the Spanish Civil War, must blow up a bridge: \u201cHe had only one thing to do and that was what he should think about. . . . To worry was as bad as to be afraid. It simply made things more difficult.\u201d Batista\u2019s soldiers approached the ridge. Though the rebels could hear branches snapping under the soldiers\u2019 boots, Menoyo told his men to hold fire, making sure that Morgan understood this time. Soon, the enemy soldiers were so close that Morgan could see the barrels of their guns. \u201cPatria o Muerte,\u201d Castro liked to say\u2014\u201cFatherland or Death.\u201d Finally, Menoyo gave the signal to shoot. Amid the screaming, blood, and chaos, some of the rebels fell back, but, as Shetterly wrote, \u201cthey noticed Morgan out in front of everyone, moving ahead, completely focused on the fight.\u201d Batista\u2019s soldiers started to flee. \u201cThey folded,\u201d Armando Fleites, a medic with the rebels, recalls. \u201cIt was a complete victory.\u201d More than a dozen of Batista\u2019s soldiers were wounded or killed. The rebels, who took the dead soldiers\u2019 guns, had not lost a single man, and afterward they enlisted Morgan to teach them better ways to fight. One former rebel recalls, \u201cHe trained me in guerrilla warfare\u2014how to handle different weapons, how to plant bombs.\u201d Morgan instructed the men in judo and how to breathe underwater using a hollow reed. \u201cThere were so many things that he knew that we didn\u2019t,\u201d the rebel says. Morgan even knew some Japanese and German. He learned Spanish, becoming a full member of the group, which was dubbed the Second National Front of the Escambray. Like the other rebels, Morgan took an oath to \u201cfight and defend with my life this little piece of free territory,\u201d to \u201cguard all the war secrets,\u201d and to \u201cdenounce traitors.\u201d Morgan rose quickly, first commanding half a dozen men, then leading a larger column and, finally, presiding over several square kilometres of occupied territory. As Morgan won more battles, the news of his curious presence began filtering out. A Cuban rebel radio station reported that rebels \u201cled by an American\u201d had killed forty Batista soldiers. Another broadcast hailed a \u201cYankee fighting for the liberty of Cuba.\u201d The Miami newspaper Diario Las Am\u00e9ricas stated that the American had been a \u201cmember of the \u2018Rangers\u2019 who landed in Normandy and opened the way to the Allied forces by destroying the Nazi installations on the French coast before D Day.\u201d U.S. and Cuban intelligence agents also began picking up chatter about a Yankee commando. In the summer of 1958, the C.I.A. reported whispers of a rebel, \u201cidentified only as \u2018El Americano,\u2019 \u201d who had played a critical role in \u201cplanning and carrying out guerrilla activities,\u201d and who had virtually wiped out a Batista unit while leading his men in an ambush. An informant from a Cuban revolutionary group told the F.B.I. that El Americano was Morgan. Another said that Morgan had \u201crisked his life many times\u201d to save the rebels, and was considered \u201cquite a hero among these forces for bravery and daring.\u201d The reports eventually set off a scramble among U.S. government agencies\u2014including the C.I.A., the Secret Service, the State Department, Army intelligence, and the F.B.I.\u2014to determine who William Alexander Morgan was, and whom he was working for. THE SECRET DOSSIER \n \n J. Edgar Hoover was feeling tremors of instability. First, there was his heart: in 1958, he had suffered a minor attack, at the age of sixty-three. The head of the F.B.I., Hoover was obsessed with his privacy, and kept the incident largely to himself, but he began a relentless diet-and-exercise regimen, disciplining his body with the same force of will that had eradicated a childhood stutter. He instructed the bureau\u2019s research-and-analysis section to inform him of any scientific advancement that might extend the human life span. Compounding Hoover\u2019s unease was that \u201cinfernal little Cuban republic,\u201d as Theodore Roosevelt had described it. Hoover warned his agents that the growing number of Castro followers in the U.S. \u201cmay pose a threat to the internal security\u201d of the country, and he had ordered his agents to infiltrate their organizations. Although Hoover rarely travelled abroad, he wanted to transform the F.B.I. into an international spy apparatus, building upon the vast network that he had created within the U.S., which trafficked in raw history: wiretapped conversations, surveillance photographs, papers from garbage bins, intercepted cables, gossip from ex-lovers. The U.S. intelligence branches had not yet turned up evidence that Castro or his followers were Communists, and, given Batista\u2019s brutality, some American officials were developing a soft stance toward the rebels. The C.I.A. officer in charge of Caribbean operations later acknowledged, \u201cMy staff and I were all Fidelistas.\u201d But Hoover remained vigilant: of all the enemies that he had hunted, he considered the agents of Communism the \u201cMasters of Deceit,\u201d as he called his 1958 best-selling book about them. These plotters had hidden streams of information, and they mutated, like viruses, in order to slip past a host\u2019s defenses; Hoover was determined to stop them from infiltrating an island just south of Florida. A source inside the U.S. Embassy in Havana had informed him that Batista\u2019s hold on the country was \u201cweakening.\u201d Now Hoover was receiving reports of a wild gringo up in the mountains. Was Morgan a Soviet sleeper agent? A C.I.A. operative in a cover posture? Or one who had gone rogue? After peering into so many lives, Hoover understood that virtually everyone has secrets. Scribbled in a diary. Recorded on a cassette. Buried in a safe-deposit box. A secret may be, as Don DeLillo has written, \u201csomething vitalizing.\u201d But it can also cut you down at any moment. By late 1958, Hoover had unleashed a team of G-men to figure out what Morgan might he hiding. One of them eventually knocked on the door of a large Colonial house in the Old West End of Toledo, Ohio. A distinguished-looking gentleman greeted him. It was Morgan\u2019s father, Alexander, a retired budget director of a utility company and, as his son once described him, a \u201csolid Republican.\u201d He was married to a slim, devout woman, Loretta, who was known as Miss Cathedral, for her involvement in the Catholic church down the street. In addition to their son, they had a daughter, Carroll. Morgan\u2019s father told the F.B.I. agent that he had not heard from his son, whom he called Bill, since he disappeared. But he provided a good deal of information about Morgan, and this, combined with F.B.I. interviews of other relatives and associates, helped Hoover and his spies piece together a startling profile of the Yankee rebel. \n \n Morgan should have been a quintessential American, a shining product of Midwestern values and a rising middle class. He attended Catholic school and initially earned high marks. (His I.Q. test showed \u201csuperior intelligence.\u201d) He loved the outdoors and was a dedicated Boy Scout, receiving the organization\u2019s highest award, in 1941. Years later, he wrote to his parents, \u201cYou . . . have done all that is possible to bring up your children with love of God and country.\u201d Wildly energetic, he always seemed to be chattering, earning the nickname Gabby. \u201cHe was so likable,\u201d his sister told me. \u201cHe could sell you anything.\u201d But Morgan was also a misfit. He failed to make the football team, and his constant banter exposed a seam of insecurity. He disliked school and often slipped away to read stories of adventure, especially tales about King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, filling his mind with places far more exotic than the neighborhood of cropped lawns and boxy houses outside his bedroom window. His mother once said that Morgan had a \u201cvery, very vivid imagination,\u201d and that he had brought his fancies to life, constructing, among other things, a \u201cdiving helmet\u201d worthy of Jules Verne. He rarely showed \u201cfear of anything,\u201d and once had to be stopped from jumping off the roof with a homemade parachute. U.S. Army intelligence officials also investigated Morgan, preparing a dossier on him. (The dossier, along with hundreds of other declassified documents from the C.I.A., the F.B.I., the Army, and the State Department, was obtained through the Freedom of Information Act and through the National Archives.) In the Army\u2019s psychological assessment, a military-intelligence analyst stated that the young Morgan \u201cseemed to be fairly well adjusted to society.\u201d But, by the time he was a teen-ager, his resistance to the strictures around him, and to those who wanted to pound him into shape, had reached a feverish state. As his mother put it, he had decided that, if he would never belong in Toledo, he would embrace exile, venturing \u201cout in the world himself.\u201d In the summer of 1943, at the age of fifteen, Morgan ran away. His mother later gave a report to the Red Cross about her son, saying, \u201cShocked is the mild word for it. . . for he had never done anything like this before.\u201d Although Morgan returned home a few days later, he soon stole his father\u2019s car and \u201ctook off\u201d again, as he later put it, blowing through a red light before the police caught him. He was consigned to a detention center, but he slipped out a window and vanished again. He ended up in Chicago, where he joined the Ringling Brothers circus. Ten days later, his father found him taking care of the elephants, and brought him home. In the ninth grade, Morgan dropped out of school and began roaming the country, hopping buses and freighters; he earned money as a punch-press operator, a grocery clerk, a ranch hand, a coal loader, a movie-theatre usher, and a seaman in the Merchant Marine. His father seemed resigned to his son\u2019s fitfulness, telling him in a letter, \u201cGet as much adventure as you can and we will be glad to see you whenever you decide you want to come home.\u201d Morgan later explained that he had not been unhappy at home\u2014his parents had given him and his sister \u201canything that we wanted\u201d\u2014and had fled only because he longed \u201cto see new places.\u201d His mother believed that he had a mythic image of himself, and \u201calways seemed to yearn to be a big shot,\u201d but, given his \u201csuper affectionate nature,\u201d she doubted that \u201che has really meant to worry or hurt us.\u201d Nevertheless, Morgan increasingly took up with \u201cthe wrong kind of gangs of boys,\u201d as he later called them, and got in scrapes with the law. While still a minor, he and some friends stole a stranger\u2019s car, temporarily tying up the driver; he was also investigated for carrying a concealed weapon. Nobody\u2014not his parents, not the F.B.I., not the military-intelligence analyst\u2014could unravel the mystery of Morgan\u2019s antisocial behavior; it remained forever encrypted, an unbreakable code. His mother wondered whether something had happened to him during her pregnancy, lamenting, \u201cThat boy hasn\u2019t given me a moment\u2019s peace. . . . That\u2019s why my hair is gray.\u201d His father told the F.B.I. that perhaps his son needed to see one of those head doctors. A psychiatrist, cited by Army intelligence, speculated that Morgan was \u201cdriven along a course of self-destruction in order to satisfy his neurotic need for punishment.\u201d Yet it was possible to see Morgan, with his brooding blue eyes and cigarette perpetually clamped between his teeth, as heralding a new social type: a beatnik, a rolling stone. A friend of Morgan\u2019s once told a reporter, \u201cJack Kerouac was still imagining life on the road while Morgan was out there living it.\u201d Morgan\u2019s personality\u2014\u201cnomadic, egocentric, impulsive, and utterly irresponsible,\u201d as Hoover\u2019s agents put it\u2014also had some similarities with that of a middle-class teen-ager thousands of miles away. In 1960, a conservative American journalist observed, \u201cLike Fidel Castro, though on a lesser scale, Morgan was a superannuated juvenile delinquent.\u201d Hoover and the F.B.I. discovered that, contrary to press accounts, Morgan had not served during the Second World War. Envisaging himself as a modern Sinbad\u2014his other nickname\u2014he had tried to enlist but was turned away, because he was too young. It was not until August, 1946, when the war was over and he was finally eighteen, that he joined the Army. After receiving orders that he would be deployed to Japan, in December, he cried in front of his mother for the first time in years, betraying that, despite his toughness, he was still just a teen-ager. He boarded a train for California, where he had a layover at a base, and on the way he sent his parents a telegram: Have surprise\u2014married yesterday 12:30 am to Darlene Edgerton. Am happy\u2014will write or call soon as possible. Don\u2019t worry or get excited. He had sat beside her on the train, in his starched uniform. \u201cHe was tall and handsome and so magnetic,\u201d Edgerton, who is now eighty-seven and blind, recalls. \u201cTruthfully, I was coming home to marry someone else, and we just hit it off and so we stopped off in Reno and got married.\u201d They had known each other for only twenty-four hours and spent two days in a hotel before getting back on a train. When they reached California, Morgan reported to the base and left for Japan. \u201cWhat young people will do,\u201d Edgerton says. With Morgan stationed in Japan, the marriage dissolved after a year and a half, and Edgerton received an annulment\u2014though even after she married another man she kept a letter from Morgan stashed away, which she occasionally unfolded, flattening the edges with her fingers, and read again, stirred by the memory of the comet-like figure who had briefly blazed into her life. Morgan was crestfallen by the end of the relationship, but his mother told the Red Cross, \u201cKnowing Bill, I am sure if he had an opportunity to date other girls he would soon forget this present love.\u201d Indeed, Morgan took up with Setsuko Takeda, a German-Japanese night-club hostess in Kyoto, and got her pregnant. When Takeda was about to give birth to their son, in the fall of 1947, he could not get a leave, and so he did what he had always done: he ran off. He was arrested for being AWOL, and, while in custody, he claimed that he needed to see Takeda\u2014she was suicidally distraught after being harassed by another soldier. With the aid of a Chinese national who was also locked up, Morgan overpowered a military-police officer and stole his .45. \u201cMorgan told me not to move,\u201d the officer later testified. \u201cHe told me to take off my clothes. Then he told the Chinaman to tie me up.\u201d Wearing the guard\u2019s uniform and carrying his gun, Morgan escaped in the middle of the night. A military search party located Takeda, and she led authorities to a house where Morgan had said he would wait for her. When she saw Morgan in the rear of the building, she threw her arms around him. One of the officers, seeing the gun in his hand, screamed, \u201cDrop it!\u201d Morgan hesitated, then, like a character in a dime novel, spun the pistol on his finger, so that the butt faced the officer, and handed it over. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take you long to get here,\u201d Morgan said, and asked for a cigarette. On January 15, 1948, at the age of nineteen, Morgan was sentenced by a court-martial to five years in prison. \u201cI guess I got what was coming to me,\u201d he said. His mother, in her statement to the Red Cross, pleaded for help: \u201cI sincerely want him to be a boy that I can justly be proud of, not one to hang my head in shame for having given him birth.\u201d Morgan was eventually transferred to a federal prison in Michigan. He enrolled in a class on American history; studied Japanese and German, the languages Takeda spoke; attended \u201creligious instruction classes\u201d; and sang in the church choir. In a progress report, a prison official wrote, \u201cThe Chaplain has noticed that inmate Morgan has developed a sense of social responsibility\u201d and \u201cis doing everything possible to improve himself and be an asset to society.\u201d Morgan was released early, on April 11, 1950. Though he had once hoped to reunite with Takeda and their son, the relationship had been severed. Morgan eventually moved to Florida, where he took a job in a carnival, as a fire swallower, and mastered the use of knives. He began a romance with the carnival\u2019s snake charmer, Ellen May Bethel. A small, tempestuous woman with black hair and green eyes, she was \u201cgorgeous,\u201d a relative says. In the spring of 1955, Morgan and Bethel had a child, Anne. They were married several months later, and in 1957 they had a son, Bill. Morgan struggled to be an \u201casset to society,\u201d but he seemed trapped by his past. He was an ex-con and a dishonorably discharged soldier\u2014a stain that he tried, futilely, to expunge from his record. Morgan later told a friend that, during this period, \u201che was nothing.\u201d According to an F.B.I. informant, Morgan went to work for the Mafia, running errands for Meyer Lansky, the diminutive Jewish gangster known as Little Man. In addition to overseeing rackets in the United States, Lansky had become the kingpin of Havana, controlling many of its biggest casinos and night clubs. A Mob associate once described how Lansky \u201ctook Batista straight back to our hotel, opened the suitcases and pointed at the cash. Batista just stared at the money without saying a word. Then he and Meyer shook hands.\u201d Morgan drifted back to the streets of Ohio, where he became associated with a local crime boss named Dominick Bartone. A gangster whose Mafia ties reputedly went back to the days of Al Capone, Bartone was a hulking man with thick black hair and dark eyes\u2014a \u201ctypical hoodlum appearance,\u201d according to his F.B.I. file. He classified people as either \u201csolid\u201d or \u201csuckers.\u201d His rap sheet eventually included convictions for bribery, gun-running, tax evasion, and bank fraud, and he was closely allied with the head of the Teamsters, Jimmy Hoffa, whom he called \u201cthe greatest fella in the world.\u201d One of Morgan\u2019s friends from Ohio described him to me as \u201csolid.\u201d He said, \u201cDo you know what \u2018connection\u2019 means? Well, Morgan was connected.\u201d The friend, who said that he had been indicted for racketeering, suddenly grew quiet, then added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if you\u2019re with the F.B.I. or the C.I.A.\u201d Some members of the Mafia, including Bartone, prepared for shifting alliances in Cuba, shipping guns to the rebels. Morgan\u2019s father thought that his son first got caught up in the whole Cuba business in 1955, in Florida, when he apparently met Castro, who had travelled there to garner support from the exile community for his upcoming invasion. Two years later, with Castro ensconced in the Sierra Maestra, Morgan left his wife and children in Toledo and began acquiring weapons across the U.S. and arranging for them to be smuggled to the rebels. Perhaps he was motivated by sympathy with the revolution, or by a desire to make money, or simply by an urge to flee domestic responsibilities. Morgan\u2019s father told the F.B.I. that his son had run away \u201cfrom his problems since he was a youngster,\u201d and that his Cuban escapade was just another example. Morgan, who before heading to Havana had told another gunrunner that he would see him again in Florida \u201cwhen this damn revolution is over,\u201d later gave his own explanation: \u201cI have lived always looking for something.\u201d To this day, some scholars, and even some who knew Morgan, speculate that he was sent to the Escambray by the C.I.A. But, as declassified documents reveal, Hoover and his agents had discovered something more unsettling. Morgan was not working for the agency or a foreign intelligence outfit or the Mob. He was out there on his own. WHY AM I HERE \n \n \u201cCalling Comandante William Morgan! Comandante William Morgan!\u201d It was one of his men in the Escambray, speaking on shortwave radio. \u201cHear me!\u201d came Morgan\u2019s reply. \u201cSend us reinforcements. We need help\u2014ammunition! If we stay here, they will wipe us out.\u201d By the summer of 1958, Morgan had endured countless skirmishes. \u201cWe were always outnumbered at least thirty to one,\u201d Morgan recalled. \u201cWe were a small outfit, but we were mobile and hard-hitting. We became known as the phantoms of the mountains.\u201d Morgan had witnessed, up close, the cruelties of the Cuban regime: villages ransacked and burned by Batista\u2019s Army, friends shot in the head, a senile man\u2019s tongue cut out. \u201cI know and have seen what these people have been doing,\u201d Morgan said of Batista\u2019s henchmen. \u201cThey killed. They tortured. They beat people . . . and done things that don\u2019t have a name.\u201d On one of his uniform sleeves, Morgan had sewn a U.S. flag. \u201cI was born an American,\u201d he liked to say. At night, he often sat by the campfire, where scattered sparks created fleeting constellations, and listened to the rebels share their visions of the revolution. The movement\u2019s various factions\u2014including two other groups in the Escambray and Castro\u2019s forces in the Sierra Maestra\u2014represented an array of ideologies and personal ambitions. The Escambray front advocated a Western-style democracy and was staunchly anti-Communist, a stance that was apparently shared by Fidel Castro, who, unlike his brother Ra\u00fal or Che Guevara, had expressed little interest in Marxism-Leninism. In the Sierra Maestra, Castro told a reporter, \u201cI have never been, nor am I now, a Communist. If I were, I would have sufficient courage to proclaim it.\u201d In the Escambray, Morgan and Menoyo had grown increasingly close. Morgan was older, and almost suicidally brave, like the brother of Menoyo\u2019s who had died in the Batista raid. Morgan addressed Menoyo as \u201cmi jefe y mi hermano\u201d\u2014\u201cmy chief and my brother\u201d\u2014and told him about his troubled past. Menoyo felt that Morgan was maturing, as a soldier and a man. \u201cLittle by little, William was changing,\u201d Menoyo says. In July, after Morgan was promoted to comandante, he wrote a letter to his mother, something that he had not done during his six months in the mountains. Written with a distinctive flourish of dashes, it said, \u201cI know that you neither approve or understand why I am here\u2014even though you are the one person in the world\u2014that I believe understands me\u2014I have been many places\u2014in my life and done many things of which you did not approve\u2014or understand, nor did I understand myself\u2014at the time.\u201d He contended with his old sins, acknowledging how much pain he had caused Ellen, his second wife, and their children (\u201cthese three who I have hurt deeply\u201d) by abandoning them. \u201cIt is hard to understand but I love them very deeply and think of them often,\u201d he wrote. Ellen had filed for divorce, on the ground of desertion. \u201cI don\u2019t expect she has much faith or love for me any more,\u201d Morgan wrote. \u201cAnd probably she is right.\u201d Yet he wanted his mother to understand that he was no longer the same person. \u201cI am here with men and boys\u2014who fight for . . . freedom,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd if it should happen that I am killed here\u2014You will know it was not for foolish fancy\u2014or as dad would say a pipe dream.\u201d The friend who had also smuggled weapons to the rebels later told the Palm Beach Post, \u201cHe had found his cause in Cuba. He wanted something to believe in. He wanted to have a purpose. He wanted to be someone, not no one.\u201d Morgan had composed a more philosophical statement about why he had joined the rebels. The essay, titled \u201cWhy Am I Here,\u201d said: Why do I fight here in this land so foreign to my own? Why did I come here far from my home and family? Why do I worry about these men here in the mountains with me? Is it because they were all close friends of mine? No! When I came here they were strangers to me I could not speak their language or understand their problems. Is it because I seek adventure? No here there is no adventure only the ever existent problems of survive. So why am I here? I am here because I believe that the most important thing for free men to do is to protect the freedom of others. I am here so that my son when he is grown will not have to fight or die in a land not his own, because one man or group of men try to take his liberty from him I am here because I believe that free men should take up arms and stand together and fight and destroy the groups and forces that want to take the rights of people away. In his rush to overturn Cuba\u2019s past as well as his own, Morgan often forgot to pause for periods or paragraph breaks. He acknowledged, \u201cI can not say I have always been a good citizen.\u201d But he explained that \u201cbeing here I can appreciate the way of life that is ours from birth,\u201d and he recounted the seemingly impossible things that he had seen: \u201cWhere a boy of nineteen can march 12 hours with a broken foot over country comparable to the american Rockies without complaint. Where a cigarette is smoked by ten men. Where men do without water so that others may drink.\u201d Noting that U.S. policies had propped up Batista, he concluded, \u201cI ask myself why do we support those who would destroy in other lands the ideals which we hold so dear?\u201d Morgan sent the statement to someone he was sure would sympathize with it: Herbert Matthews. The Times reporter considered Morgan to be \u201cthe most interesting figure in the Sierra de Escambray.\u201d Soon after receiving the statement, Matthews published an article about the Second Front and its \u201ctough, uneducated young American\u201d leader, citing a cleaned-up passage from Morgan\u2019s letter. Other U.S. newspapers began chronicling the exploits of the \u201cadventurous American,\u201d the \u201cswashbuckling Morgan.\u201d The Washington Post reported that he had become a \u201cdaring fellow\u201d by the age of three. The accounts were enough to \u201cmake schoolboys drool,\u201d as one newspaper put it. A retired businessman from Ohio later told the Toledo Blade, \u201cHe was like a cowboy in an Ernest Hemingway adventure.\u201d Morgan had finally willed his interior fictions into reality. \n \n One day in the spring of 1958, while Morgan was visiting a guerrilla camp for a meeting of the Second Front\u2019s chiefs of staff, he encountered a rebel he had never seen before: small and slender, with a face shielded by a cap. Only up close was it evident that the rebel was a woman. She was in her early twenties, with dark eyes and tawny skin, and, to conceal her identity, she had cut her curly light-brown hair short and dyed it black. Though she had a delicate beauty, she locked and loaded a gun with the ease of a bank robber. Morgan later said of a pistol that she carried, \u201cShe knows how to use it.\u201d Her name was Olga Rodr\u00edguez. She came from a peasant family, in the central province of Santa Clara, that often went without food. \u201cWe were so poor,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez recalls. She studied diligently, and was elected class president. Her goal was to become a teacher. She was bright, stubborn, and questioning\u2014as Rodr\u00edguez puts it, \u201calways a little different.\u201d Increasingly angered by the Batista regime\u2019s repressiveness, she joined the underground resistance, organizing protests and assembling bombs until, one day, agents from Batista\u2019s secret police appeared in her neighborhood, showing people her photograph. \u201cThey were coming to kill me,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez recalls. When the secret police could not find her, they beat up her brother, heaving him on her parents\u2019 doorstep \u201clike a sack of potatoes,\u201d she says. Her friends begged her to leave Cuba, but she told them, \u201cI will not abandon my country.\u201d In April, 1958, with her appearance disguised and with a tiny .32 pistol tucked in her underwear, she became the first woman to join the rebels in the Escambray. She tended to the wounded and taught rebels to read and write. \u201cI have the spirit of a revolutionary,\u201d she liked to say. When Morgan met her, he gently teased her about her haircut, pulling down her cap and saying, \u201cHey, muchacho.\u201d Morgan had arrived at the camp literally riding a white horse, and she had felt her heart go \u201cboom, boom, boom.\u201d \u201cI am a great romantic, and I was so moved that someone from another country would care enough about my countrymen to fight for them,\u201d she says. Morgan repeatedly sought her out at her camp. She would sometimes prepare him rice and beans (\u201cI\u2019m a guerrilla, not a cook\u201d), and he would complain, \u201cToo fast!\u201d as she spoke, in gunfire-patter Spanish, about the need to hold elections and build hospitals and schools. She seemed unlike so many of the women whom he had impetuously taken up with. Like his mother, she had a deep sense of conviction, and it was her influence, Menoyo says, that furthered \u201cWilliam\u2019s transformation,\u201d though Rodr\u00edguez saw it differently: Morgan was not so much changing as discovering who he really was. \u201cI knew William had not always been a saint,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez says. \u201cBut inside, I could tell, he had a huge heart\u2014one that he had opened not just to me but to my country.\u201d Morgan recognized the risk of surrendering to a flight of emotion in the midst of war. The Batista regime had placed a twenty-thousand-dollar bounty on him\u2014\u201cdead or alive,\u201d as Morgan put it. Once, when Morgan and Rodr\u00edguez were together, a military plane shut down its engines, so that they could not hear its approach until bombs were falling upon them. \u201cWe simply had to dive for cover,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez recalls. They barely escaped unharmed. During other bombing raids, they would hold each other, whispering, \u201cOur fates are intertwined.\u201d When Robert Jordan is overcome with love for a woman during the Spanish Civil War, he fears that they will never experience what ordinary people do: \u201cNot time, not happiness, not fun, not children, not a house, not a bathroom, not a clean pair of pajamas, not the morning paper, not to wake up together, not to wake and know she\u2019s there and that you\u2019re not alone. No. None of that.\u201d As long as Morgan was fighting in the Escambray, there could be no past or future\u2014only the present. \u201cWe could never have peace,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez says. \u201cFrom the beginning, I had this terrible feeling that things would not end well.\u201d Yet the impossibility of their romance only deepened their ardor. Not long after they met, a boy from a nearby village approached Rodr\u00edguez in camp, carrying a bunch of purple wildflowers. \u201cLook what the Americano has sent you,\u201d the boy told her. A few days later, the boy appeared again, holding a new bouquet. \u201cFrom the Americano,\u201d he said. As Morgan later told her, they had to \u201csteal time.\u201d In one such moment, a photographer caught them standing in a mountain clearing. In the image, both are wearing fatigues; a rifle is slung over his right shoulder, and she leans on one, as if it were a cane. With their free hands, they are clutching each other. \u201cWhen I found you, I found everything I can wish for in the world,\u201d he later wrote her. \u201cOnly death can separate us.\u201d \n \n \u201cMORGAN WAS KILLED THE PREVIOUS NIGHT IN THE COURSE OF A FIGHT WITH THE CUBAN ARMY.\u201d So read an urgent cable sent from the U.S. Embassy in Havana to Hoover, at F.B.I. headquarters, on September 19, 1958. The Batista regime, which had already leaked the news to the Cuban press, mailed the F.B.I. two photographs of a fractured corpse, shirtless and smeared with blood. Morgan\u2019s mother was devastated when she heard of the reports. Several weeks later, she received a letter from Cuba, in Morgan\u2019s hand. It said, \u201cThe Cuban press last month sent out word that I was dead but as you can tell I am not.\u201d Just as Batista\u2019s regime had falsely declared Castro\u2019s death, it had made the mistake of believing its own propaganda about Morgan, becoming trapped in the closed circuit of information that isolates tyrants not only from their countrymen but from reality. Meanwhile, Morgan\u2019s seeming emergence from the dead, like one of Mulholland\u2019s magical feats, created a potent counter-illusion: that he was indestructible. \n \n In October, Che Guevara arrived in the Escambray, with a hundred or so ghostly-looking soldiers. They had completed a six-week westward trek from the Sierra Maestra, withstanding cyclones and enemy fire and sleeping in swamps. Guevara described his men as \u201cmorally broken, starving . . . their feet bloodied and so swollen they won\u2019t fit into what\u2019s left of their boots.\u201d Guevara\u2014whom another rebel once depicted as \u201chalf athletic and half asthmatic,\u201d and prone to shifting in conversation \u201cbetween Stalin and Baudelaire\u201d\u2014had dark hair nearly to his shoulders. During the march, he had worn the cap of a dead comrade, but, to his distress, he had lost it, and so he began wearing a black beret. The ranks of the Second Front had grown to more than a thousand men. Morgan wrote to his mother, \u201cWe are much stronger now,\u201d and said that his men were \u201cgetting ready to come down from the hills and take the cities.\u201d Guevara had been sent to the Escambray to take control of the Second Front, as Castro was eager to eliminate any threat to his dominance and to accelerate the assault on Batista. But many rebels there resisted having their authority usurped, and submerged tensions between the groups rose to the surface. When Guevara and his men tried to enter a stretch of territory, they were confronted by a particularly combative leader of the Second Front, Jes\u00fas Carreras. After demanding a password from Guevara, Carreras refused to let him or his men pass. Morgan and Olga Rodr\u00edguez, in 1958. Their relationship, she says, was \u201cun gran amor.\u201d Courtesy Olga Morgan Goodwin Courtesy Olga Morgan Goodwin Morgan and Guevara, the two foreign comandantes, bitterly distrusted each other. The boisterous, fun-loving, anti-Communist American had little in common with the ascetic, erudite, Marxist-Leninist Argentine doctor. Morgan complained to Guevara that he had misappropriated weapons belonging to the Second Front, while Guevara dismissed Morgan and his defiant guerrillas as comevacas\u2014\u201ccow-eaters\u201d\u2014meaning that they sat around and lived off the largesse of peasants. Although Guevara and the Second Front reached an \u201coperational pact,\u201d friction remained. In November, 1958, before a climactic push against Batista\u2019s Army, Morgan slipped away with Rodr\u00edguez to a farmhouse in the mountains, where they arranged to get married. They wore their rebel uniforms, which they had washed in the river. They didn\u2019t have rings, so Morgan took a leaf from a tree, rolled it into a circle, and placed it on her finger, vowing, \u201cI will love you and honor you all the days of my life.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said, \u201cHasta que la muerte nos separe\u201d\u2014\u201cTill death do us part.\u201d After the ceremony, Morgan picked up his gun and returned to battle. \u201cWe barely had time to kiss,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez recalls. As the fighting intensified, she had a growing sense of unease. To keep her company, he had given her a parrot that cried \u201cWe-liam\u201d and \u201cI love you!\u201d But one day it flew off, and never returned. In late December, Guevara and his party launched a ferocious assault in the Santa Clara province, winning a decisive victory. That month, Morgan and the Second Front seized the tobacco town of Manicaragua, then pressed onward, capturing Cumanayagua, El Hoyo, La Moza, and San Juan de los Yeras, before reaching Topes de Collantes, a hundred and sixty miles southeast of Havana. One of Batista\u2019s colonels warned, \u201cHeadquarters can\u2019t resist anymore. The Army doesn\u2019t want to fight.\u201d The Second Front had earlier issued a statement declaring that \u201cthe dictatorship is nearly crushed,\u201d and the U.S. government tried to push out Batista, in a futile attempt to install an acquiescent \u201cthird force.\u201d Batista resisted the Americans\u2019 pressure, but his hold on power was nearly gone. At 4 A.M. on New Year\u2019s Day, David Atlee Phillips, a C.I.A. agent stationed in Havana, was standing outside his home there, drinking champagne, when he looked up and saw a speck of light\u2014an airplane\u2014receding into the sky. Realizing that there were no departing flights at that hour, he telephoned his case officer, and offered a gem of information: \u201cBatista just flew into exile.\u201d \u201cAre you drunk?\u201d the case officer replied. But Phillips was right\u2014Batista was escaping, with his entourage, to the Dominican Republic\u2014and word rapidly spread throughout Cuba: \u201cSe fue! Se fue! \u201d He\u2019s gone! Meyer Lansky was in Havana at the time, and was among the first people there to be tipped off. \u201cGet the money,\u201d he commanded an associate. \u201cAll of it. Even the cash and checks in reserve.\u201d After dawn, Morgan was preparing to battle for the city of Cienfuegos when the cry reached him and Rodr\u00edguez: Se fue! Se fue! Morgan ordered his men to take the city immediately. Everyone, including Rodr\u00edguez, jumped into cars and trucks, racing into a city where they had expected an intense battle but where Batista\u2019s Army, once impregnable, dissolved before them as thousands of jubilant residents poured into the streets, honking horns and banging on makeshift drums. The crowds greeted Morgan, who wrapped a rebel flag around his shoulders like a cape, to shouts of \u201cAmericano!\u201d Morgan, who told reporters, \u201cI\u2019m forgetting my English,\u201d cried at the crowds grasping at him, \u201cVictoria! Libertad!\u201d In an interview with Look, Morgan said, \u201cWhen we came down from the mountains, it was a shock to all of us . . . to find how much faith the Cuban people had in this revolution. You felt you simply couldn\u2019t betray their hopes.\u201d Morgan was put in charge of Cienfuegos. He had finally become somebody, he told a friend. On January 6, 1959, at one in the morning, Castro paused in Cienfuegos during his triumphant march to Havana. It was the first time that Morgan had met with Castro in Cuba, and the two former delinquents shook hands and congratulated each other. In interviews, Castro repeated his opposition to Communism and promised to hold elections within eighteen months. Before a gathering of thousands in Havana, he vowed, \u201cWe cannot become dictators.\u201d Whatever doubts Morgan had about Guevara, he seemed to harbor none about Castro, who once declared, \u201cHistory will absolve me.\u201d \u201cI have a tremendous admiration\u2014a tremendous respect\u2014for the man,\u201d Morgan later told the American television broadcaster Clete Roberts. \u201cI respect his moral courage, and I respect his honesty.\u201d Morgan cast the revolution in his own distinctive terms: \u201cIt\u2019s about time the little guy got a break.\u201d Roberts observed that Morgan\u2019s life, including his romance with Rodr\u00edguez, sounded \u201clike all of the movie scripts that were ever dreamt about in Hollywood.\u201d Morgan insisted that he had no interest in selling his story: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that you should cash in on your ideals. I don\u2019t believe I was an idealist when I went up into the mountains, but I feel that I\u2019m an idealist now.\u201d Morgan had not slept for two days after Batista fled, and he welcomed the chance to shave and wash the jungle grime off his body. Rodr\u00edguez soon changed out of her uniform, confident that \u201cthe war was over and that we would raise a family and live in a democracy.\u201d In Cienfuegos, they exchanged proper wedding rings. Rodr\u00edguez says, \u201cI cannot describe the happiness I felt\u2014we felt.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez had become pregnant. For Morgan, it suddenly seemed that he and Rodr\u00edguez could have everything: a house, children, the morning paper. As Morgan put it, \u201cAll I\u2019m interested in is settling down to a nice, peaceful existence.\u201d THE CONSPIRACY \n \n In March, 1959, a mysterious American suddenly appeared at the Hotel Capri, where Morgan and Rodr\u00edguez were staying temporarily. The man, who was in his late forties, had stiff black hair and thick glasses, and looked like he could be an employee of NASA, the new space agency. In the lobby, he called Morgan and said that he needed to see him. His name was Leo Cherne. \u201cI\u2019m sure he never heard of me before,\u201d Cherne recalled, in an unpublished oral history. Imposing, learned, and discreet, Cherne was a wealthy businessman and a power broker who had advised several U.S. Presidents, including Franklin Roosevelt and Eisenhower. In 1951, he became chairman of the International Rescue Committee. Over the years, there was speculation that, under Cherne, the I.R.C. had sometimes served as a front for C.I.A. activities\u2014a charge that Cherne publicly denied. In any case, he was enmeshed with people in intelligence circles, a man who relished being privy to a cloak-and-dagger world. In his oral history, Cherne said that he had once been \u201cdeeply attracted\u201d to Castro, rivalling Herbert Matthews in his \u201cblind enthusiasm.\u201d But Cherne had grown apprehensive after the revolution. With disturbing coolness, Castro had dispatched several hundred members of Batista\u2019s regime \u201cto the wall,\u201d and his indeterminate ideology, his instinctive defiance, and his gargantuan ambition posed serious risks. And so the C.I.A. sought to put more eyes and ears around Castro, eventually assigning him the cryptonym AMTHUG. Morgan must have seemed like a tantalizing target for recruitment. He had a built-in cover and access, spoke Spanish, and, as a U.S. citizen, seemed easier to turn: he would not have to become a traitor to his country. Morgan\u2019s support for Castro and the revolution presented an impediment, but, as any seasoned case officer knew, virtually everyone had a \u201csoft spot\u201d: greed, jealousy, sexual temptation. One simply needed to find the spot and inflame it, until the target breached a system of beliefs for a system of information, for silent calls and dead drops. It seemed that Morgan had a spark of resentment that could catch fire. Castro, wary of rivals, had denied prominent government positions to many members of the Second National Front of the Escambray, including Menoyo. Adam Clayton Powell, a congressman from New York, had just returned from a fact-finding mission in Cuba, where he had overheard Morgan\u2014whom he described as \u201ca sweet guy, but very tough\u201d\u2014criticizing the new regime. At the Hotel Capri, Cherne was surprised to find that Morgan occupied a small, sparely furnished room. Rodr\u00edguez had gone out, but armed barbudos\u2014bearded guerrillas\u2014kept entering and exiting, as if the cramped room were a makeshift headquarters. Morgan wore his rebel uniform, the star of a comandante emblazoned on each epaulet. His revolver rested on a dresser. Cherne told Morgan that he had sought him out to promote the I.R.C.\u2019s work in Cuba and to obtain an audience with Castro, but Morgan was wary. He knew that Havana had become a city of spooks, and Cherne had shown him an I.R.C. brochure featuring William Joseph (Wild Bill) Donovan\u2014the famous spymaster of the Second World War, who was an honorary chairman of the committee\u2019s board. Morgan suspected that Cherne was an American intelligence officer representing \u201cvery substantial and powerful forces.\u201d As they conferred, Morgan, perhaps believing that his secrets would be safe with a professional keeper of them, confessed something that he had not revealed even to his closest friends, including Menoyo. Morgan admitted that the story he had told about an American friend being killed by Batista was a fabrication\u2014a sleight of hand that had allowed him to sneak himself into the narrative of history. \u201cMorgan told the truth, trusting that I would not take it public,\u201d Cherne recalled. Morgan touched on his troubled past, and Cherne believed that Morgan was \u201ccourageous, tough, able, resourceful but a bad boy. . . . And it was this bad boy who found in the developing events in Cuba something exciting.\u201d Cherne observed how well Morgan spoke Spanish, how he commanded respect from the rebels passing through the room, and how bright he seemed, despite having only an eighth-grade education. \u201cI\u2019ve rarely met a person as genuinely articulate, as clever, in some ways brilliant, as I found him to be, all by instinct,\u201d Cherne noted. He soon returned to the Capri for another meeting. This time, a barbudo lay sprawled on the bed, apparently dozing. Morgan, even then the loose-lipped Gabby, said that he wanted to disclose something \u201cvery important.\u201d Cherne looked around anxiously, and asked, \u201cHow do you know the room is secure?\u201d Morgan assured him that it was, but Cherne pointed to an air-conditioning vent, where a bug might be installed. \u201cI must apologize,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cYou are absolutely right.\u201d He picked up a transistor radio, placed it in front of the vent, and cranked up the music. Cherne was still concerned about the Cuban on the bed. Morgan\u2019s \u201cblithe willingness to take risks was not altogether to my taste,\u201d Cherne recalled. But, sensing that Morgan had \u201cirresistible\u201d information, he let him proceed and, with his permission, even used a miniature recording device that he had brought with him. Morgan confided that Guevara and Ra\u00fal Castro were Marxist-Leninists who threatened the revolution. Guevara had enlisted someone to kill him, but Morgan had captured the agent and, before letting him go, obtained a written confession, which he had stashed away. \u201cThat is the insurance policy which will keep me alive,\u201d Morgan claimed. Cherne asked Morgan if he thought that Fidel Castro was a Communist. Morgan said no and emphasized that many Cubans were committed to democracy. Cherne found Morgan\u2019s tale of intrigue \u201cfilled with perceptive fact.\u201d Morgan expressed the hope that Cherne could use his influence to secure foreign economic aid for some three thousand families in the Escambray who had been \u201cbombed out\u201d during the war. And he said he was worried that the U.S. government would revoke his citizenship, as some anti-Castro elements were clamoring for. Cherne suspected that he had pinpointed Morgan\u2019s soft spot: the Yankee comandante wanted to make sure that, if things grew too dangerous, he could return to America with his family; he feared being left out in the cold. Cherne believed that Morgan was not seeking personal advantage. Rather, Morgan was hoping to \u201ceven the score\u201d with his beloved country, where he had fallen short as a citizen and a soldier. \u201cThis was his act of expiation,\u201d Cherne concluded. Morgan handed Cherne a 1946 five-centavo coin. Its edge had a small notch. If Cherne wanted to send someone to see him in the future, he should give that person the coin for presentation to Morgan\u2014a sign of trustworthiness. After Cherne left the hotel, with the coin and the recording of their conversation tucked away, he grew anxious that he had been spied upon. Why had he taken such a foolish risk? Cherne scribbled on paper what he had learned, put it in an envelope, and slipped it to a trusted friend in Havana. \u201cJust in case I didn\u2019t get out,\u201d he recalled. Cherne returned to his hotel and remained in his room. The phone rang, but he did not answer it. \u201cI heard footsteps outside my door, and I sweated freely,\u201d he recalled. Finally, he rushed to the airport, waited an \u201cinterminable period,\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t relieved until the plane took off.\u201d On March 20th, Cherne went to C.I.A. headquarters\u2014then a complex of shabby buildings on E Street, in Northwest Washington, D.C. A sign saying \u201cU.S. Government Printing Office\u201d had once hung out front, but, after President Eisenhower and his driver struggled to find the entrance, it was replaced with the C.I.A.\u2019s emblem. Cherne was ushered through security and into the French Room, a conference space used by senior C.I.A. officials, where he met with the acting chief of the Western Hemisphere Division. Cherne debriefed him about his encounter with Morgan, which he considered one of the \u201cmost incredible and fascinating accidental exposures to political reality in my entire life.\u201d The C.I.A. cultivates its own private language, and Cherne, who was identified in a classified document about Morgan simply as \u201cHQS contact,\u201d was serving as a spotter\u2014someone who identifies a potential asset for recruitment. Cherne told the C.I.A. that Morgan could be very valuable, as he was on excellent terms with Castro. And Cherne passed on Morgan\u2019s coin\u2014the kind of object that the magician Mulholland called a \u201crecognition signal.\u201d A C.I.A. report concluded that Morgan had \u201cKUCAGE possibilities.\u201d In his 1975 book, \u201cInside the Company,\u201d Philip Agee, a former C.I.A. officer who turned against the agency and allegedly assisted Castro\u2019s regime, revealed that KUCAGE stood for highly sensitive psychological and paramilitary operations. \u201cThey are action rather than collection activities,\u201d Agee wrote. \u201cCollection operations should be invisible so that the target will be unaware of them. Action operations, on the other hand, always produce a visible effect. This, however, should never be attributable to the C.I.A. or to the U.S. government.\u201d Not long after Castro took power, the C.I.A. began to seek out action operators who could press the \u201cmagic button\u201d: assassination. In addition to commissioning Mulholland\u2019s manuals, the C.I.A. had created a document titled \u201cA Study of Assassination.\u201d After noting that the \u201cmorally squeamish should not attempt it,\u201d the study laid out various techniques: The most efficient accident . . . is a fall of 75 feet or more onto a hard surface. Elevator shafts, stair wells, unscreened windows and bridges will serve. . . . The act may be executed by sudden, vigorous [lifting] of the ankles, tipping the subject over the edge. If the subject is deliberately run down, very exact timing is necessary and investigation is likely to be thorough. . . . The subject may be stunned or drugged and then placed in the car, but this is only reliable when the car can be run off a high cliff or into deep water without observation. At the end of March, the C.I.A. authorized a background investigation of Morgan\u2014\u201ca.k.a. \u2018El Americano.\u2019 \u201d Its agents needed more \u201cbiographical data\u201d before trying to recruit Morgan. On March 30th, the agency\u2019s Central Cover Division requested that it be advised immediately when Morgan had been \u201cactivated.\u201d Two weeks later, Castro arrived in Washington, D.C., on what he billed as a \u201cgood will\u201d tour. President Eisenhower declined to meet with him, but, when Castro appeared in public, wearing his rumpled green fatigues and empty pistol holster, he was cheered by Americans who saw him as a folk hero. \u201cViva Castro!\u201d they shouted. Around this time, as Aran Shetterly, the biographer, recounts, another curious guest appeared at the Hotel Capri. He was a reputed bagman for the Mob named Frank Nelson. The Mob feared, correctly, that Castro planned to shutter its casinos and night clubs. (\u201cWe are not only disposed to deport the gangsters, but to shoot them,\u201d Castro later proclaimed.) Nelson said that a friend in Miami was interested in Morgan\u2019s \u201cservices.\u201d \u201cIn my services?\u201d Morgan asked, confused. It was Nelson\u2019s turn to look around the room nervously. In a hushed voice, he said, \u201cMy friend is ready to pay you well if you help him.\u201d He paused. \u201cA million dollars.\u201d The conversation continued in Miami, where Morgan met in a secure hotel room with Nelson\u2019s \u201cfriend.\u201d It was the Dominican Republic\u2019s consul there, who was serving as yet another go-between, in order to conceal the true identity of the plotters. One of the masterminds was Rafael Trujillo, the tyrant who had ruled the Dominican Republic for three decades, and who was even more sadistic than Batista. His security chief likened his rule to that of \u201cCaligula, the mad Caesar.\u201d One of Trujillo\u2019s maxims was \u201cHe who does not know how to deceive does not know how to rule,\u201d and he had a penchant for scheming to kill his opponents abroad. In 1956, Trujillo allegedly orchestrated the kidnapping, in New York, of a lecturer at Columbia University who had served in the Trujillo government, and was about to publish a doctoral thesis critical of the regime. After being taken back to the Dominican Republic and delivered to Trujillo, the scholar was believed to have been stripped naked, tied to a rope on a pulley, then lowered, slowly, into a vat of boiling water. Now Trujillo wanted to eliminate Fidel Castro. In the hotel room in Miami, Trujillo\u2019s consul was joined by Batista\u2019s former chief of police. (Batista, still in the Dominican Republic, was helping to bankroll the operation.) Also present was a broad-chested, dapper man whom Morgan recognized from his days in organized crime: Dominick Bartone. After the revolution, the gangster had sought out Morgan, trying to sell the Castro regime several Globemaster military cargo airplanes. Bartone was now trying to sell the planes to the plotters seeking to overthrow Castro. Bartone\u2019s ally Jimmy Hoffa had allegedly attempted to siphon three hundred thousand dollars from the Teamsters\u2019 pension fund to float the deal. One of Hoffa\u2019s aides later informed the government that the scheme \u201cwas purely and simply Hoffa\u2019s way of helping some of his Mob buddies who were afraid of losing their businesses in Cuba.\u201d The men in the hotel room represented interests tied to the Mob, the Teamsters, Batista, and Trujillo, a longtime ally of the United States. These divergent lethal forces had found coherence in a single audacious plot. As they tried to persuade Morgan, they, too, probed for his soft spot. \u201cI understand that you and your people have been treated badly,\u201d Nelson had said in his pitch. \u201cBesides, a million dollars is always a million dollars.\u201d To the rest of the world, Morgan might have become the Yankee comandante. But the plotters were confident that, deep down, he was still good ol\u2019 Billy Morgan. \u201cWe\u2019ll give you everything you ask for,\u201d Batista\u2019s former police chief said. Morgan soon got back to them. He let them know that he had consulted with Menoyo, and that they had given careful thought to what had happened in Cuba since the revolution. And Morgan said that he, along with members of the Second Front, was ready to join the conspiracy. \n \n Hoover sensed that something was afoot. There were reports from informants that, in recent months, Morgan had received tens of thousands of dollars from the Dominican consul, the cash often stuffed in \u201ccommon paper bags.\u201d There were whispers that Morgan, who had moved with Rodr\u00edguez into a house in Havana, was being ferried messages from a priest acting in the interest not of God but of Rafael Trujillo. And there were rumors that, in Florida, Morgan had met with Johnny Abbes Garc\u00eda, the head of Trujillo\u2019s secret police, who was a master at extracting information (he had studied Chinese methods of torture) and at concealing it (he reputedly had an affair with Trujillo\u2019s half brother). \u201cJOHNNY went to Miami to make contact with MORGAN,\u201d an F.B.I. report said, adding that Abbes Garc\u00eda and his bodyguard had \u201ca good time in a calypso nightclub.\u201d Hoover and his men tried to detect a hidden design in the data they were collecting. They were witnessing history without the clarity of hindsight or narrative, and it was like peering through a windshield lashed with rain. As Hoover confronted the gaps in his knowledge, he became more and more obsessed with Morgan. A former fire-eater at the circus! Hoover hounded his evidence men to \u201cexpedite\u201d their inquiries, homing in on Morgan\u2019s ties to Dominick Bartone. The mobster, whom the bureau classified as \u201carmed and dangerous,\u201d had recently been arrested with his associates at Miami International Airport, where they had been caught loading a plane with thousands of pounds of weapons\u2014a shipment apparently destined for mercenaries and Cuban exiles being trained in the Dominican Republic. The incident had not only intensified Hoover\u2019s scrutiny of Morgan and the plotters; it also aroused the interest of the Senate Rackets Committee and its chief counsel, Robert F. Kennedy, who was investigating links between Hoffa\u2019s Teamsters and organized crime. At a hearing in June, 1959, Kennedy demanded, \u201cDo we have any background on Mr. Morgan?\u201d When a Teamster official was questioned by the committee about the weapons scheme, he said, more than once, \u201cI decline to answer because I honestly believe my answer may tend to incriminate me.\u201d Another witness, however, acknowledged that Morgan had \u201cworked for Bartone in years past.\u201d While the F.B.I. tracked Morgan\u2019s movements, he made repeated forays to Miami, where he met with his conspirators. That summer, he also travelled to Toledo for a visit with his mother and father, whom he had not seen since leaving for Cuba, a year and a half earlier. His parents savored the brief reunion, but they could tell that Morgan was feeling \u201cheat and pressure,\u201d as he later put it. When his mother looked at his clothing and belongings, she noticed that there wasn\u2019t any identification on him\u2014he\u2019d become a man from nowhere. She asked him what kind of trouble he was getting into now. Nothing, he assured her. But she sensed that he was planning to pull off, as she later put it, yet another \u201ctrick.\u201d \n \n The hand is not \u201cquicker than the eye,\u201d Mulholland warned in his spy manuals. The key to an illusion is to make the audience explain away the fact that it has been deceived in plain sight. On July 27, 1959, Morgan flew again to Miami, this time with Rodr\u00edguez. Eight months pregnant, she provided some cover. Still, Morgan was stopped by authorities at the airport in Miami and taken to a holding room, where he was confronted by two men with close-cropped hair, dark suits, and dark ties: Hoover\u2019s agents. After apprising Morgan of his rights, the agents pressed him about why he had come to Miami. He insisted that he was there to have fun with his wife for a few days, but, under further questioning, he admitted that a representative of a foreign government had contacted him about leading a counter-revolution in Cuba. \u201cSubject refused to identify the individuals with whom he was in contact,\u201d the agents wrote in a report. Morgan said that he was in a \u201cprecarious position.\u201d The agents eventually let him go, but Hoover ordered his men to monitor Morgan\u2019s movements by \u201cemploying physical surveillances and utilizing other confidential techniques.\u201d The F.B.I. reported that \u201csubject\u2019s pregnant wife was seen being driven from the Montmartre Hotel in a 1959 blue Cadillac.\u201d The agents traced the car: it belonged to Dominick Bartone. On July 31st, Morgan phoned the F.B.I., letting its agents know that Rodr\u00edguez had returned to Cuba. He said that he planned to go back himself, on a Pan American flight, in two days. Within hours of the call, though, he took off, leaving his belongings in his hotel room. The agents tried to pick up his trail, but he had vanished. On the night of August 6th, the F.B.I. subsequently learned, Morgan boarded a small fishing vessel, in a \u201cclandestine manner,\u201d and rendezvoused off the coast of Miami with a fifty-four-foot yacht manned by two mercenaries. The vessel was stripped of any name or registration number, and was loaded with machine guns, explosives, and other armaments. With Morgan aboard, the yacht set off for Cuba and, after eluding the U.S. Coast Guard and nearly running out of fuel, slipped into Havana Harbor, on August 8th. Hoover believed that he was worming his way inside the conspiracy. One F.B.I. source reported that Morgan was planning to \u201cassassinate Castro.\u201d Another said that the plot was to take out Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro. According to multiple sources, a strike force of nearly a thousand Cuban exiles and mercenaries would be transported, by plane, from a base in the Dominican Republic to Trinidad, a colonial town at the foot of the Escambray Mountains. Once these forces landed, it was believed, they would be led by Morgan, whom a cable from the U.S. Embassy described as \u201can enigma.\u201d Morgan had received from Trujillo a shortwave radio\u2014a bulky contraption with dozens of thick black dials. Morgan set it up on a wooden desk in his house, and after turning the dials he heard the scratchy sound of a voice: Trujillo\u2019s killer spy, Abbes Garc\u00eda, in the Dominican Republic. An informant later told the F.B.I. that Abbes Garc\u00eda operated his radio every evening after midnight, and often identified himself by saying, \u201cThis is the Red Cow.\u201d Morgan was given the code name Henry\u2014a reference to Henry Morgan, the seventeenth-century Welsh privateer, who had been commissioned by the English crown to plunder gold from Cuba, then a Spanish colony. Once, when Henry Morgan found himself trapped by a Spanish armada, he floated toward the enemy a ship, rigged with incendiary materials and wooden dummies, which then exploded, allowing him to escape, in one of the greatest ruses in seafaring history. \n \n William Morgan flicked on the shortwave radio late one August night. \u201cHenry speaking,\u201d he said. \u201cCome in . . . Come in . . . \u201d The Red Cow picked up his signal, and Morgan told him that the plot had begun. \u201cOur troops are advancing,\u201d he said. Abbes Garc\u00eda could hear bombs and gunfire in the background. \u201cForward, Henry!\u201d came the jubilant reply. Hoover and other high-level officials at the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the Navy, the Army, the Air Force, and the State Department circulated intelligence about Morgan and his plot. Urgent wire reports were issued: \u201cFidel\u2019s home in Cojimar shot . . . Reliable sources state small group attacked Ra\u00fal\u2019s home . . . Whereabouts Morgan not known . . . Telephone communications to Las Villas and Camag\u00fcey provinces cut . . . Rumors of fighting . . . Armed services on full alert . . . Expecting something further, probably invasion . . . Havana Harbor will be bombed at 4:00 a.m. . . . It is expected that Castro will be finished.\u201d Hoover and his colleagues picked up intelligence that Morgan and other members of the Second Front, including Menoyo and Jes\u00fas Carreras, had gathered in Trinidad, where they had secured a muddy airstrip, effectively cutting the island in two. Trujillo was heard broadcasting a message to the Cuban people, saying, \u201cFire, fire, fire to that demon Fidel Castro and his brother Ra\u00fal!\u201d Trujillo began to air-drop dozens of crates of .50-calibre ammunition to Morgan and his followers, the billowing white parachutes seesawing down from the clouds. When another supply plane returned, its crew reported seeing lit bombs tracing paths across the night sky, as if there were an electrical storm. On August 12th, Morgan, who had brought the shortwave radio with him, spoke to Trujillo, and told him that his forces had captured the town. \u201cTrinidad is ours!\u201d Morgan said. \u201cDon\u2019t let us down.\u201d The following evening\u2014Castro\u2019s thirty-third birthday\u2014Trujillo dispatched to Cuba a plane carrying the first members of the strike force. As the soldiers disembarked at the airstrip in Trinidad, which had been marked with lights, they could hear Morgan and his men shouting denunciations of Castro, and, as they joined in, the cries grew louder and more intense, converging, like voices at a stadium, in a deafening incantation: \u201cDEATH TO CASTRO!\u201d Then a towering, bearded figure, who had also been chanting, emerged from where he was hiding, under a mango tree. It was Fidel Castro. Morgan had pulled off a trick within a trick. He was not a counter-revolutionary\u2014he was a double agent. He and the Second Front had been colluding with Castro; the radio messages, the cutting of communications, and the exploding bombs had all been part of the stagecraft of what Morgan described as a \u201cfictitious war.\u201d Morgan and those loyal to Castro pointed machine guns at the stunned fighters from the strike force. One of Trujillo\u2019s men later said, \u201cI should not be judged as a conspirator, but as an imbecile.\u201d Soldiers from the strike force drew their guns, and for a moment the plotters and the counter-plotters peered at one another, as if still puzzling over who had crossed whom. Then a few of Trujillo\u2019s men opened fire, and everyone began shooting. One of Morgan\u2019s friends ran toward the plane and was killed. By the time the fusillade ended, two members of the strike force had died, and the rest had been apprehended. Morgan had helped break the first major counter-revolutionary plot against the Castro regime. Later, during a five-hour televised address that lasted until three in the morning, Castro explained what had happened. Morgan, smiling and wearing his crisp rebel uniform, appeared beside him. During the previous few months, he and Castro had spent hours scheming. Castro was seen draping his long arm around Morgan, his prized double agent. He hailed Morgan as a \u201cCuban,\u201d and Morgan referred to Castro as his \u201cfaithful friend.\u201d Menoyo recalls, \u201cThey had complete trust in one another.\u201d The Yankee comandante revealed to the public that, after being approached to lead the counter-revolution, he and Menoyo had alerted Castro, who directed them to draw out their enemies. Castro said in his televised address, \u201cEveryone played his assigned parts. It was better than a movie.\u201d Herbert Matthews, in a letter to Hemingway, described the events as \u201cstranger than fiction but real.\u201d Morgan and Menoyo had been so convincing in their roles as counter-revolutionaries that Leo Cherne, and others, suspected that they had originally been part of the conspiracy, switching sides only when they were about to be discovered. But, according to Menoyo and others involved in the scheme, they had not turned against Castro\u2014who remained revered in Cuba, and who had reaffirmed his support of democratic principles during his April visit to Washington. Despite Morgan\u2019s concerns about the Castro regime, he stated emphatically that he and members of the Second Front would \u201cnever unite\u201d with brutes like Trujillo or Batista. On August 20th, Morgan called the F.B.I. agents who had pursued him in Miami, and apologized for not having been more forthcoming. He explained that he had not wanted to \u201csell out Cuba,\u201d where he had many friends. He added that he didn\u2019t think that he had broken any American laws, though he might have \u201cbent\u201d them slightly. The Secret Service launched an investigation of Morgan and recommended that no action be taken against this man of \u201cunquestioned courage,\u201d given that he posed no threat to \u201cthe safety and welfare of our President.\u201d But Hoover fumed over the deception, and in September the State Department stripped Morgan of his citizenship. The C.I.A. made no effort to intercede on Morgan\u2019s behalf. That May, according to declassified documents, the agency had cancelled its effort to recruit him, after a background check turned up evidence of his criminal youth and his scandalous military record. An internal memorandum had noted, \u201cStation strongly feels any covert arrangement with Morgan undesirable from security standpoint.\u201d In the end, the authentic nature of Morgan\u2019s rebelliousness made him too unpredictable: better to deal with someone simply looking for a score. Trujillo\u2014who was later assassinated in a C.I.A.-assisted plot\u2014placed a half-million-dollar bounty on Morgan\u2019s head. When Clete Roberts, the American broadcaster, visited Morgan\u2019s house, in September, 1959, he found it surrounded by bodyguards with Thompson submachine guns. \u201cI ought to tell you back in the United States that Mr. Morgan and I are sitting in what you might call an armed camp,\u201d Roberts said. He asked Morgan, \u201cHow does it feel to have a half-million-dollar price on your head?\u201d Morgan replied coolly, \u201cWell, it isn\u2019t too bad. They are going to have to collect it. And that\u2019s going to be hard.\u201d The Castro government made Morgan a Cuban \u201ccitizen by birth\u201d and promised to protect him. The Associated Press wrote that he had obtained \u201calmost legendary stature\u201d on the island, and Cherne said that he had become \u201cthe hero of the republic.\u201d Morgan further bolstered his reputation when he handed over to the Cuban government seventy-eight thousand dollars that he had received from the Dominican consul, asking that the money be invested in economic development in the Escambray region. When Morgan walked along the streets of Havana, people reached out to touch him; there was even a popular song celebrating his exploits. In August, Rodr\u00edguez gave birth to a daughter, who was named for Morgan\u2019s mother, Loretta. Rodr\u00edguez recalls that Castro showed up at the clinic to congratulate her and Morgan. \u201cHe wanted to be the godfather,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez says, though the honor went to Menoyo. Morgan was astonished that so many Cubans had embraced him. \u201cThese are people who never saw me before in their lives,\u201d he told Roberts. \u201cThey never knew me. They just know me by what I\u2019ve done or how I\u2019ve been with them.\u201d He said that the revolution had been fought for a beautiful idea\u2014freedom\u2014and that he was not willing to abandon the promises that he had made in the mountains. Though a few Marxist-Leninists had tried to \u201csneak\u201d into power amid the turmoil in the country, he said, the Cuban people were too individualistic to accept such a system. \u201cCommunism breeds on ignorance and poverty,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the first thing that the revolution is doing is creating schools and creating jobs and creating homes and giving people land in which they can increase their income.\u201d He acknowledged that many of Cuba\u2019s revolutionaries were young and inexperienced, and had made mistakes; but their main political aim remained helping \u201cthe little guy.\u201d Though Morgan was anguished over losing his American citizenship\u2014\u201cThe greatest thing that ever happened to me was to have been born in the United States,\u201d he once said\u2014he was content with his growing family, and was eager to help build a new Cuban society. \u201cI\u2019m a Cuban now,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I believe in the revolution.\u201d Or, as he later put it, \u201cI am betting my life that the revolution succeeds.\u201d THEY\u2019RE GONNA GET YOU! \n \n Morgan did not take a post in the Castro government, saying, \u201cI\u2019ve never been a politician\u2014I\u2019m a soldier.\u201d But he remained an adventurer, and in the fall of 1959 he set up a bold experiment in Cuba\u2019s swamps, under the auspices of the National Institute of Agrarian Reform. Earning a small monthly salary, he built several nurseries, including one in the Escambray, that bred bullfrogs for their tender meat and valuable skins, which could be used to make wallets and belts and purses. Morgan began with a few frogs, but they quickly multiplied, the tadpoles becoming stout creatures that, with their legs extended, were as long as a foot. The nurseries were soon filled with a mass of croaking creatures devouring, whole, virtually anything they could swallow\u2014bugs, fish, mice, even other frogs\u2014the wild proliferation continuing until Morgan presided over a kingdom of more than half a million frogs. It was like the story of Exodus that he had read as a child: \u201cAnd the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.\u201d Morgan often worked eighteen-hour days, digging a network of shaded trenches to accommodate his ever-growing stock. The Cuban press hailed Morgan\u2019s project as a \u201cmiracle,\u201d and when a reporter asked him if he had used architectural diagrams to lay out the farms he replied, \u201cBlueprints, your ass. I dug those fucking ditches.\u201d He hired hundreds of peasants to operate the farms, delivering the kind of economic opportunity that he and the rebels had promised during the revolution. Viola June Cobb, an American who had worked as a secretary for Fidel Castro, later testified secretly before a Senate subcommittee, and said that Morgan was \u201ca boy with ideals\u201d who had a \u201ctremendous desire to be helpful,\u201d and that through his farms he had improved the lives of some two thousand peasants. \u201cThe ones I had seen in rags and barefoot now were wearing shoes and stockings, looking decent,\u201d she said. Dignitaries and reporters travelled to the swamps to see the famed Yankee comandante and double agent. An article in Time called him the \u201cImprobable Frogman.\u201d Morgan projected his usual buoyant self. \u201cCuban frogs\u2019 legs are tops,\u201d he\u2019d say. Or \u201cCuba shipped a million dollars\u2019 worth of frogs\u2019 legs to the U.S. last year. I\u2019m going to double that.\u201d On July 31, 1960, Rodr\u00edguez gave birth to a second girl, Olguita. Before Morgan came to Cuba, he had been a neglectful father, and he regretted it. He had sent a letter to Anne, his daughter from his second marriage, who was now five: When I saw you last you were just a little tyke. . . . You use to sit in the window and when you saw my car drive in you would say\u2014Daddy Daddy. . . . And I know when I did not come home any more I know you missed me and looked out the window for your dad\u2014this was a long time ago baby and possibly you don\u2019t remember\u2014but I do\u2014And always will. Morgan now doted on his baby girls, having concluded that a man who has \u201chis family is probably the happiest person in the world.\u201d In a debriefing by the C.I.A., a reporter said of Morgan, \u201cHe seemed happy and secure.\u201d But, after foiling the Trujillo conspiracy and helping to save the revolution, he grew increasingly uneasy with the political forces that he had helped to unleash. Morgan had predicted to the F.B.I. that the influence of radicals, such as Guevara and Ra\u00fal Castro, would diminish in Cuba. But Fidel had placed Ra\u00fal in charge of the armed forces, and appointed as head of the national bank Guevara, who pushed for increased state control over the economy. On October 19th, Huber Matos, a heralded rebel commander, resigned from the government, protesting the growing influence of Communists. In a letter to Fidel Castro, he wrote, \u201cPlease, in the names of our fallen comrades, of our mothers, of all the people, Fidel, do not bury the revolution.\u201d Two days later, Matos was arrested. He was sentenced to twenty years in prison. Earlier that year, in March, the White House had approved a top-secret plan to topple the Castro regime. The operation came to eerily resemble the Trujillo conspiracy. A brigade of more than a thousand Cuban exiles\u2014this time secretly trained by the U.S., at a base in Guatemala\u2014would invade by sea, landing at a beach in the town of Trinidad. B-26 bombers would pre\u00ebmptively strike Castro\u2019s Air Force to protect the brigade, which, if necessary, could escape into the Escambray Mountains. It was the most ambitious covert operation in U.S. history. At a White House meeting, President Eisenhower told the plan\u2019s architects, \u201cEveryone must be prepared to swear that he has not heard of it.\u201d That summer, while preparations for an invasion were under way, the C.I.A. pushed the magic button. In another echo of the Trujillo plot, the agency turned to members of the Mafia, including an associate of Lansky\u2019s, to assassinate Castro. Various stratagems were considered, including blowing Castro\u2019s head off with an exploding cigar, jabbing him with a poison-filled Paper Mate pen, and contaminating a diving suit with tuberculosis germs. Amid this blur of plots and counter-plots, Morgan struggled to find clarity. No longer close with Castro, he could not tell if the Cuban leader was reacting to provocations from Washington, or if he was being undermined by more radical elements in the government, or if he was revealing that, beneath his rebel garb, he was just another dictator, willing to grasp any ideology that would consolidate his power. One day, members of the Communist Party tried to organize a meeting on one of Morgan\u2019s farms. He expelled them, saying, \u201cFidel and Ra\u00fal know that I\u2019m against the Communists.\u201d A friend of Morgan\u2019s from the Second Front recalls, \u201cI said to William, \u2018You have to be careful. You\u2019re talking too much.\u2019 But William loved to talk.\u201d \n \n In April, 1960, a reporter observed of Morgan, \u201cBehind the bravado one senses confusion, regret, anxiety over what lies ahead.\u201d In Havana, Morgan\u2019s house had been shot at more than once\u2014perhaps by agents of Trujillo or perhaps by an unknown enemy. \u201cOne time, they killed our dog,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez recalls. Afterward, Morgan moved the family into an apartment building protected by more than a dozen guards, many of whom lived with them. \u201cIt always seemed that we could never be alone,\u201d he once said to Rodr\u00edguez. An informant told the C.I.A. that Morgan\u2019s \u201cevery move was being watched by the Cuban military.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez suspected that two of the bodyguards living with them were spying for the G-2, Castro\u2019s military-intelligence service. \u201cI wanted them out,\u201d she recalls. But Morgan did not wish to be disloyal. In this sense, Morgan was not a classic double agent, for he was someone who wanted to believe. \u201cHe always trusted people,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez says. Still, he took precautions, choosing his own driver, and going to work in a blue Oldsmobile outfitted with two submachine guns and a glove compartment stuffed with grenades. Morgan had no desire to flee Cuba. As he later told his mother, \u201cIt would have been necessary to be a traitor to myself, my friends and my beliefs.\u201d He continued tending to his frogs, with their deafening chorus. One day, Morgan learned that his rebel comrade Jes\u00fas Carreras, now an antagonist of the regime, had been picked up by state security, in Santa Clara. Morgan raced to the military barracks there, and demanded that the guards release Carreras. \u201cI\u2019m a comandante!\u201d Morgan shouted, pointing to his star. The guards complied, and Morgan escorted Carreras away, mindful of the warning that another rebel colleague had given him: \u201cWatch out! They\u2019re gonna get you!\u201d Morgan considered seeking political asylum for his family. But he had confessed to one reporter, \u201cI\u2019ve run out of countries,\u201d and noted to another that \u201ca guy in the middle can so easily get caught.\u201d Cuba\u2019s drift toward Communism continued, and several of Morgan\u2019s friends returned to the Escambray, to take up arms against the regime. As Michael D. Sallah reported a decade ago, in an illuminating account in the Toledo Blade, Morgan started to have weapons smuggled into the mountains in the fall of 1960. \u201cEvery week, trucks would carry them up,\u201d a worker told me. Once, Morgan was planning to take a shipment to a hideout himself, but Rodr\u00edguez said that it was too dangerous. Everyone will recognize you, she said, insisting on transporting the weapons herself. \u201cWe had an argument,\u201d she recalls. Rodr\u00edguez prevailed, and this time it was Morgan who anxiously waited at home. His opposition to the regime became more vocal. \u201cIf anything happens to me, you\u2019ll know the Commies have really taken over,\u201d he told one reporter, and said to another, \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m going to last.\u201d Still, Viola Cobb, the secretary, says that Morgan did not completely lose faith with Castro: \u201cHe had the idea that he was standing by, and that when Fidel finally realized that the Communists were taking over he would blow the whistle, and William Morgan and Gutierrez Menoyo and some of the others would help him rescue the country.\u201d On October 19th, two days after the Eisenhower Administration recalled Philip Bonsal, its Ambassador to Cuba, presaging the end of diplomatic ties, Morgan was summoned to a meeting at the National Institute for Agrarian Reform. He brought a handbag made from frog skin\u2014a gift for the wife of one of the officials. Rodr\u00edguez and Morgan had plans that evening, but by seven o\u2019clock he had not returned home. \u201cHe was always punctual,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez recalls. Her premonitions coming back in a rush, she left the children with their nanny and told Morgan\u2019s driver to take her to the institute. At the institute\u2019s gate, she shouted at a guard, \u201cWhere\u2019s William?\u201d \u201cWilliam had to go someplace,\u201d he said. \u201cI need to see William. I have to see him.\u201d \u201cWilliam said you should come with us.\u201d The guards began encircling the car, and she told the driver, \u201cGo! Go!\u201d They sped away, returning home, but state-security guards soon barged through the apartment door. \u201cI\u2019m the wife of Comandante Morgan,\u201d she said, trying to intimidate them. But they shoved her aside and searched the apartment, terrifying the girls, one of whom was two months old, the other fourteen months. Rodr\u00edguez learned what had happened to Morgan: upon entering the institute, he had been surrounded by state security and taken to G-2 headquarters. Jes\u00fas Carreras had been rounded up, too. Rodr\u00edguez had been right about the two bodyguards at the apartment: they were spies. Rodr\u00edguez could not get permission to see Morgan, who had been placed in detention. According to an account that Morgan wrote in prison, which was later smuggled out of the country and obtained by the C.I.A., Cuban military-intelligence officials interrogated him. \u201cI said I would only talk to Fidel,\u201d Morgan wrote. For nearly a month, he was in solitary confinement. He became violently ill and, fearing that the government was trying to poison him, made himself vomit to purge any toxins. After a month, he was moved to La Caba\u00f1a, the prison overlooking Havana Harbor. Several times, he discovered ground glass in his food. He still felt extremely sick, and asked another prisoner if he had any medicine to \u201ckill pain.\u201d When the man said yes, Morgan pleaded, \u201cShoot it into my arm.\u201d He didn\u2019t trust the guards to do it. The man obtained a syringe from a prison doctor and injected Morgan with the medicine. In December, Menoyo, who says that he had not participated in the smuggling of weapons into the Escambray, visited Morgan at La Caba\u00f1a. \u201cYou are my chief and my brother,\u201d Morgan told him. Menoyo, who had lost both of his siblings to war, replied, \u201cYou are my brother.\u201d They embraced. Not long after Menoyo left the prison, he and a dozen members of the Second Front fled the country, on three small fishing vessels, and headed for America. On December 31st, Rodr\u00edguez, who had been placed under house arrest, was permitted to see her husband. Rats scurried in the corners of the crowded meeting room. Though she did not want to upset Morgan, she told him that she was being held prisoner in their home, and that she had little water or food. \u201cNo one is allowed to visit,\u201d she said. \u201cThe babies are sick.\u201d Morgan urged her to flee\u2014to get the children out of Cuba before it was too late. \u201cIf you can, go to Toledo,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mother will help you.\u201d He took her hand. \u201cEverything\u2019s going to be O.K.,\u201d he said. But Rodr\u00edguez, who rarely betrayed fear, was scared. \u201cI was so worried about him and what would happen to our baby girls,\u201d she recalls. After five minutes, the guards said that her time was up. \u201cI love you with every part of me,\u201d he said. They stole a kiss before being separated. \n \n That night, when Rodr\u00edguez returned home, she crushed sleeping pills into hot chocolate and offered the drink to the men guarding her. At two in the morning, when all the guards appeared to be asleep, she gathered her daughters. \u201cHush,\u201d she whispered to them. When the baby began to cry, she gave her a toy, and then, carrying both girls in her arms, she crept out of the house. She went to the Brazilian Embassy, where she was given sanctuary after telling the Ambassador and his wife, \u201cPlease, I\u2019m in big trouble.\u201d Morgan was also trying to break free. He studied the design of La Caba\u00f1a and the routine of the guards, looking for a flaw in the system. \u201cMorgan had all kinds of escape plots,\u201d another prisoner later told the C.I.A. Morgan worked to regain his strength. A press attach\u00e9 at the U.S. Embassy later wrote, \u201cUp at dawn, he would put himself through calisthenics, then march around the compound, shouting commands at himself.\u201d The inmate who had given Morgan painkillers recalled, \u201cHe exercised like an athlete and marched like a soldier.\u201d Morgan turned increasingly toward his Catholic faith. He wore a rosary and often prayed. Hiram Gonz\u00e1lez, a twenty-four-year-old revolutionary who had been arrested for conspiring against the regime, had just arrived at La Caba\u00f1a, and watched in despair as prisoners were taken out and killed by firing squads, while birds swooped down to \u201cpeck at the bits of bone, blood, and flesh.\u201d Morgan, he recalls, tried to cheer him up, offering his mattress. When Morgan found him crying in a corner, he went up to him and said, \u201cChico, men don\u2019t cry.\u201d \u201cAt times like this, I\u2019m not a man.\u201d Morgan put his hand on his shoulder. \u201cIf it helps your suffering, then it\u2019s O.K.\u201d Morgan walked him around the prison yard until he felt better. \u201cHe was the only one to help,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez recalls. Two days later, on March 9, 1961, guards seized Morgan and escorted him across the compound to a room where a military tribunal was being held. Along the way, Morgan, trying to summon courage, murmured song lyrics to himself: \u201cOver hill, over dale, we have hit the dusty trail / And those caissons go rolling along.\u201d There were eleven other defendants at the tribunal, including Carreras. Rodr\u00edguez was tried in absentia. A few weeks earlier, Che Guevara had published an essay denouncing members of the Second Front. \u201cRevolutions, accelerated radical social changes, are made of circumstances,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are made of passions, of man\u2019s fight for social vindication, and are never perfect.\u201d The mistake of the Cuban Revolution, Guevara argued, was its accommodation of men like the Second Front commanders. \u201cBy their presence, they showed us our sin\u2014the sin of compromise . . . in the face of the actual or potential traitor, in the face of those weak in spirit, in the face of the coward.\u201d He went on, \u201cRevolutionary conduct is the mirror of revolutionary faith, and when someone calls himself a revolutionary and does not act as one, he can be nothing more than heretical. Let them hang together.\u201d At the trial, Morgan and Carreras were charged with conspiracy and treason. Later, Fabi\u00e1n Escalante, who served for many years as the head of Cuban counter-intelligence, detailed the case against Morgan, claiming that he had been a longtime American intelligence operative\u2014a \u201cchameleon\u201d\u2014who, in 1960, had attempted to \u201corganize, for the C.I.A., a band of counter-revolutionaries in the Escambray.\u201d Without a doubt, the C.I.A. was trying to foment the new insurgency in the mountains. But U.S. documents, which have since been declassified, suggest that Morgan was never a C.I.A. operative. Indeed, an agency memorandum dated October 5, 1960\u2014two weeks before Morgan\u2019s arrest\u2014voiced \u201cstrenuous objections\u201d to the idea of using him. This followed an inquiry by Army intelligence, which had concluded that enlisting Morgan would be \u201cextremely worthwhile.\u201d (The Army had considered sending him a \u201csecret writing system\u201d\u2014most likely, one involving invisible ink.) After Morgan\u2019s arrest, an Army internal memo noted that Morgan had not become a registered operative. \u201cWilliam was never an American agent,\u201d Menoyo says. \u201cIt is simply a lie by the Castro regime to justify its actions.\u201d At the tribunal, Morgan complained that his lawyer had only just learned of the charges against him. Morgan and Carreras, branded pseudo-revolutionaries, faced death by firing squad. The prisoner who had given Morgan the painkillers recalled, \u201cThe whole prison was agog with the news that Morgan and Carreras were actually going to stand trial. Not even the most zealous of the young rebels believed that Fidel Castro would shoot these two men, who had played such a big role in the Cuban Revolution.\u201d Morgan denied that he had ever been a foreign agent and said, \u201cI have defended this revolution because I believed in it.\u201d He explained, \u201cIf I am found guilty, I will walk to the execution wall with no escort, with moral strength, and with a clear conscience.\u201d A young man in the back of the courtroom, ignoring warnings by authorities, spoke out on Morgan\u2019s behalf. It was the rebel who had broken his foot in the Escambray. \u201cWilliam would not abandon me,\u201d he recalls. The trial lasted little more than a day. A defendant\u2019s fate was usually signalled by which room he was taken to before the verdict. \u201cIf you went to the right, you went into a copiea, a little chapel-like room, and you knew you were going to get shot,\u201d a prisoner recalled. \u201cFor most prisoners, if you went to the left, you got thirty years.\u201d Most of the defendants were led to the left. Rodr\u00edguez, who was twenty-four, also received a thirty-year sentence. Morgan, along with Carreras, was led to the right, and condemned to die the next day. An American radio broadcaster at the trial told his listeners that he had witnessed \u201ca farce.\u201d Morgan asked to speak one last time to his mother, but the request was denied. Morgan had written Loretta a five-page letter on La Caba\u00f1a stationery\u2014\u201cthe longest letter I have ever written,\u201d he told her. (The letter was recently uncovered, by Michael Sallah.) Morgan understood that the very cause that had helped save his life would likely lead to his death. \u201cI have been prepared for this as long as I have been in prison,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFor after all it is not when a man dies but how.\u201d Morgan knew that he had to get the letter past government censors, so his criticisms of Castro were oblique. \u201cNo man has a right to impose his will or beliefs on others,\u201d Morgan wrote. \u201cI feel sorry for those who accuse me and who are responsible for what will pass. They accuse with fear in their hearts and ambition in their minds not knowing that good never comes of evil.\u201d Morgan was ready to give his life for Cuba: \u201cThe way of freedom is hard\u2014and the road is covered with the blood of those who must die so that the rights of man can live.\u201d He wanted to protect what he considered sacred about the revolution, and believed that only in time would a proper verdict be rendered on his life: \u201cHumans leave their actions to be judged by other people in the pages of history so it is not what we do but the result of what we do that is finally judged.\u201d Morgan went on, \u201cI write these things as they run through my mind so that by reading this you might better know what kind of man is your son. . . . Raising a boy like me was not an easy task or did we always agree what was the right thing to do. But I have always worshipped you and dad.\u201d He told his mother, \u201cDon\u2019t cry for me. I know that you understand. The life of a man is in the hands of god and he calls when he is ready for us. It is very few who are fortunate enough to have time to prepare to meet him. If now is my time I will be ready and am looking at death not with fear but with expectation. God bless you. . . . Until we meet again, take care of Olga and the children.\u201d Loretta could not so easily accept his fate, and launched a furious campaign to save him. She enlisted the local office of the F.B.I. and contacted the White House, which responded, \u201cWe fully understand and deeply sympathize with your anxiety for your son.\u201d After Cuban officials denied Morgan\u2019s request to talk to his mother, he asked if he could say goodbye to Rodr\u00edguez. Again, he was refused. So Morgan sent her a letter, knowing that the only thing that could ever separate them was upon them. \u201cAs a writer of love letters I am not so good,\u201d he said. \u201cTo tell you that I love you, it\u2019s not sufficient, because words could never express my feelings towards you. Since the first time I saw you in the mountains until the last time I saw you in prison, you have been my love, my happiness, my companion in life and in my thoughts during my moment of death.\u201d He regretted how little time they had spent together, and he recalled the \u201cbeautiful plans\u201d that they had made to settle in the \u201cmountains with the girls, living in peace and tranquility.\u201d He tried to console her, assuring her that he was not afraid, and did not consider death \u201can enemy.\u201d Though some members of the Second Front had vowed to retaliate if he was killed, Morgan told Rodr\u00edguez that he did not want anyone to seek revenge on his behalf, not even against the bodyguards who had betrayed him. \u201cThey are young and will have to fight with their conscience,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not want blood spilled over my cause. . . . It\u2019s better that I die because I have defended lives. I only ask that someday the truth will be known and that my daughters will be proud of their father.\u201d He told her, \u201cI have great peace in my spirit,\u201d because at least she and the girls were safe. In fact, things were in tumult. A few days earlier, a distraught Rodr\u00edguez had learned that several of their allies were planning a last-minute assault on La Caba\u00f1a. In a kind of delirium, Rodr\u00edguez\u2014who later cut her hair short and dyed it black, as she had when she first went into the mountains\u2014told the wife of the Brazilian Ambassador that she needed to leave for a few days. Protect my daughters until I return, she said. The Ambassador\u2019s wife, with whom she had grown close, pleaded with her not to go. \u201cI have to save William,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said. Carrying her .32, she slipped into the trunk of a waiting car, and raced away. Morgan, meanwhile, was granted permission to see his girls, and one of Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s relatives brought them to La Caba\u00f1a. Morgan was briefly allowed to talk to them, to hold them. Morgan told Rodr\u00edguez, in his letter, \u201cLet them know someday who their father was, and what my beliefs and ideals were.\u201d Earlier, he\u2019d sent a note to Bill, his son from his second marriage, who was now four. Saying that he could \u201cspeak from experience, most of it hard,\u201d Morgan told him, \u201cLove your God\u2014and Your Country\u2014and Stand Up for both,\u201d adding, \u201cAnd I know that your Country . . . will Always be proud of you.\u201d In his letter to Anne, he had said: When the time comes for you to get married and have a family of your own. Pick a good man Baby\u2014One with his head high but both feet on the ground\u2014And if you find one who wants to see the world\u2014or dreams of castles in the sky\u2014let him see the world\u2014honey\u2014by himself\u2014Possibly you may never see this letter. But if you do, remember your dad was one of those people\u2014who saw the world\u2014And its very hard for those who love such a man. Not long after Rodr\u00edguez left the Brazilian Embassy, Castro\u2019s forces smashed the plot to liberate Morgan, killing or arresting many of the conspirators. Rodr\u00edguez, meanwhile, sought refuge in a safe house, in Santa Clara. Late in the evening on March 11th, Carreras was taken before the firing squad and shot. Five minutes afterward, Morgan\u2014who had made his plea to speak with Castro directly\u2014was brought outside. Morgan prayed the whole way, then removed the rosary around his neck and gave it to a priest, asking that his mother receive it. As he had written her, \u201cI leave a love of God and country.\u201d Through the floodlights, Morgan peered at the muzzles of the rifles. There was no longer any hope of escape. No more castles in the sky. According to a prisoner\u2019s account, a voice in the distance shouted, \u201cKneel and beg for your life.\u201d It was the last thing that Morgan could control. \u201cI kneel for no man,\u201d he said. One of the executioners shot him in the right knee. The Yankee comandante tried to stay on his feet, blood spilling around him. Then he was shot in the left knee. Finally, he collapsed, and was repeatedly shot in the torso and head. His face, a witness said, was \u201cblown off.\u201d \u201cMany of the men in the patio were crying,\u201d the prisoner who had provided medicine recalled. \u201cThe rumbling, that almost rose to the pitch of a riot, was a tribute to William Morgan\u2019s popularity.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez, sequestered in the safe house, did not yet know of her husband\u2019s death, but she felt a presence in her room. \u201cI saw William,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt him give me a kiss. No sound. Just the warmth of a kiss.\u201d Menoyo, who learned of his friend\u2019s death while being held at an immigration detention center in McAllen, Texas, says, \u201cIt was like I lost a part of me.\u201d When Morgan\u2019s lawyer called Loretta to break the news, she dropped the phone. Morgan\u2019s daughter Anne, who was with her at the time, says, \u201cI remember my grandmother falling down on the floor, screaming and crying. That is a memory I will never forget.\u201d After Morgan was killed, Herbert Matthews sent Ernest Hemingway a letter. By then, Matthews, who once claimed that he had \u201cinvented\u201d Castro, had seen his reputation collapse as his reporting on Cuba was exposed as gullible and partisan. In his letter, he told Hemingway, \u201cThere were even some pickets parading in front of the Times last Saturday bearing placards against me.\u201d Matthews was rattled by Castro\u2019s decision to execute Morgan. He reread the \u201cvery moving\u201d statement that Morgan had sent him from the mountains, and told Hemingway, \u201cHere was an obviously uneducated and very simple, tough guy who yet went to Cuba, as he says, to fight for the American principles of freedom and against Communism. He went on doing so for so long that he got himself executed.\u201d Matthews said that he thought Morgan\u2019s saga was \u201clike an Ernest Hemingway story,\u201d adding, \u201cif anybody writes it, it should be you.\u201d On March 12th, Rodr\u00edguez, still unaware that Morgan had been executed, got in a car with a friend to go to another safe house, in Camag\u00fcey. State-security vehicles suddenly surrounded them, and Rodr\u00edguez was taken to a prison processing center, in Havana, where a sergeant greeted her as the \u201cwidow of William Morgan.\u201d With that, she knew. She lunged at the sergeant, pounding him with her fists, then ran out to the street, through the town, as the police gave chase; she kept running, not knowing where she was going. \u201cI ran for an hour,\u201d she says, before the police caught her. Rodr\u00edguez was taken to La Caba\u00f1a, and forced to walk by the wall where Morgan had been executed. Guards then took her to another prison, locking her in a cell that had a hole in the floor for a latrine. Lizards crawled over her at night. \u201cThe guards beat me with sticks,\u201d she recalls. \u201cOh, God, did they beat me.\u201d \n \n A month later, the newly inaugurated U.S. President, John F. Kennedy, launched the invasion of Cuba that had been approved by Eisenhower in 1960. Although America\u2019s role was evident, Kennedy hoped to maintain deniability, and so the landing place was shifted from the town of Trinidad to the more remote Bay of Pigs\u2014a location that would reduce the \u201cnoise level\u201d but that was too far west to allow escape into the Escambray Mountains. At the last moment, Kennedy also cancelled a second wave of air strikes, fearing that they would betray direct U.S. involvement. Soon after the counter-revolutionary brigade landed on the beach, it was bombarded. The commander sent out urgent messages over his shortwave radio to American officials: 12:28 P.M.: Without jet air support cannot hold. Have no ammo left for tanks. 1:25 P.M.: Need air support immediately. Red Beach wiped out. Late that evening, the commander said, \u201cI have nothing left to fight with. . . . Farewell, friends!\u201d The line went dead. The brigade was obliterated: a hundred and fourteen members killed, and more than a thousand captured. A C.I.A. operative said that, for the rest of his life, he would have regrets about what happened, but added, \u201cThat is the echo of anybody who\u2019s ever tried to do anything in history.\u201d At the outset of the Bay of Pigs attack, Castro declared, for the first time, that Cuba was socialist. Philip Bonsal, the former Ambassador, later said of Castro, \u201cHe cannot endure any sharing of authority. . . . This drive for power is a far more constant element in his makeup than is the philosophy behind any particular revolutionary panacea he may be peddling. Castro has now attained his goal. Everything in Cuba hinges on him. He holds his job at his own pleasure.\u201d Menoyo was released from the Texas detention center. After writing to Morgan\u2019s mother that \u201cWilliam will be our eternal symbol until we will either win or perish,\u201d he went to Florida and founded Alpha 66, a paramilitary organization aimed at overthrowing Castro. On December 28, 1964, Menoyo and three members of the group boarded a boat in the Dominican Republic and landed at the southeastern end of Cuba. After twenty-eight days on the run in the mountains, Menoyo and his party were captured. When guards removed a blindfold that they had made Menoyo wear, he recalls, he was standing before Castro. \u201cI knew you would come, but I also knew that I would catch you,\u201d Castro said. Menoyo was thrown into prison, vanishing along with Rodr\u00edguez. THE LAST FIGHT ||||| ***starred review***A nonfiction account of an unlikely American hero in revolutionary Cuba that succeeds as both a thriller and a love story. While working at the Toledo Blade, Miami Herald reporter Sallah and AP reporter Weiss. . . .met a remarkable woman living in Toledo, a Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9 and former political prisoner whose story inspired another newspaper series and this book. When she was Olga Maria Rodriguez, she had fallen in love with and married a man who initially didn't even speak her language, an American named William Morgan who had found purpose in his difficult, directionless life by joining the revolutionary forces in Cuba to overthrow Fulgencio Batista. His experience in the U.S. Army had ended with him going AWOL, but his superior military skills helped him overcome the distrust of his Cuban comrades and earn the admiration of the country's citizenry, who were \"hailing him as a hero of a revolution that was about the change the course of history.\" Yet there was tension in the revolutionary forces between Morgan's Second Front and Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement, as the former remained committed to liberating the country and holding elections while the latter was consolidating power and turning the new government into a communist dictatorship. Even greater complications ensued as Morgan was recruited for a plot to assassinate Castro, turned double agent by revealing the plot to the targeted dictator while continuing to play along, and ultimately found himself stripped of his American citizenship and imprisoned by the Cuban government. His widow's memories help humanize a complicated and conflicted man whose story sheds fresh light on the pivotal period in U.S.-Cuban relations. Beyond the political implications and entanglements, the story engrosses with its fast-paced, plainspoken narrative. \n \n A work of classic journalism, a compelling narrative that is a combination of interviews, documents, and news accounts form the time. . . .The stakes are many and real, the characters are compelling, and the shifting allegiances make for effective suspense.

But in Cuba, he was the Yankee Comandante who fought the revolution alongside Fidel Castro and Che Guevara; as a biographer puts it, the \"ne\u2019er-do-well who found his cause, his love, and his redemption in Cuba. He became something he never was in America. He becomes a hero in Cuba.\" The Daily Beast takes a look at the curious and fascinating case of Morgan, whom a New Yorker profile once celebrated as \"Holden Caulfield with a machine gun;\" executed in 1961 after a failed counterrevolution against Castro's turn toward Communism, Morgan is buried in an unmarked grave in Havana. Now, with US-Cuba relations warming, his widow hopes that Cuba will at last return his remains to American soil. \"For me, he is a hero,\" she says. \"For the Cuban people, he is a hero. He gave his life for my country. I promised I would do this.\" Morgan's story is the stuff of movies (and has in fact been optioned by George Clooney): He became the only foreigner other than Che to reach the Cuban army's highest rank, comandante; fell in love with and married Olga Rodriguez; and reportedly told the firing squad that executed him, \"I kneel for no man.\" But \"once he died, much larger events eclipsed his story,\" says Michael Sallah, the author of The Yankee Comandante. \"He kind of got lost in history.\" Havana scrubbed mention of him, and his American citizenship was only restored in 2007, notes the Beast. But now, says a lawyer in Ohio, where his widow wants to bury him, \"we're more optimistic because of recent developments.\" Says Sallah: \"No one should ever doubt his love of America.

But also, his presence was a reminder of the way she consistently bucked convention; at Cannes in May, for instance, she not only flouted its notoriously sexist high-heel mandate for women by donning oxfords and a sensible tweed with a tulip skirt, she doubled down with Gary (and Fisher Stevens, who co-directed her Debbie Reynolds documentary) getting comfortable on the carpet. The French surely blanched; I hope Gary shed a little. \n \n Fisher\u2019s own writerly looks were generally quirky-sensible with a bit of glam; at the New York Film Festival, she paired eggplant with eggplant, a long scarf and fur atop that; at ComicCon in August, her snake-print cardigan added brightness to sleek black, and her embellished sneakers were a chic topper\u2014they could have been Prada, or Dior, or Donna Karan, or Christopher Kane. \n \n At the EE British Film Academy Awards, she spoke to us through her handbag and a swathe of painterly stripes; at the premiere of Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie, with daughter Billie Lourd, she went as a proper schoolgirl, tweed and knee-highs; her The Force Awakens premiere look was crystalline and velvet like a royal would, but she also found time on the carpet to mock standard red-carpet posing, one leg cannily in front of the other, lips pursed. \n \n At the premiere of Vacation, a statement dress, and a selfie. \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n Advertisement \n \n And one of the most iconic fashion moments on television of the past ten years happened at Roseanne Barr\u2019s Comedy Central Roast: she wore a brown pantsuit, tinted eyeglasses, and puffed an e-cig for the duration. And she was funnier than any of the professional comedians on the lineup. \n \n A Michaelangelo-print blouse; full-body scarf; a silk robe for a pajama party in support of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign. Every choice was made with whimsy, and to be unmistakably herself. \n \n And finally, with her mother Debbie Reynolds in a smart patterned blazer as a young girl, proving that she\u2019s maintained this personal flair her whole life. \n \n Goodnight to a true queen. \n \n ||||| Enlarge Image Lucasfilm \n \n When I first saw Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia in 1977's \"Star Wars: A New Hope,\" she was fresh-faced and full of confidence and witty comebacks for the roguish rake Han Solo. \n \n She didn't suffer fools gladly and she often battled Stormtroopers better than the fellas. She killed Jabba the Hutt with a chain, for crying out loud. \n \n She was the perfect geek girl role model because she was no damsel in distress. Inspired by her, I wore my hair in Princess Leia buns in elementary school yearbook photos. \n \n But Fisher, who died Tuesday at 60 after suffering a heart attack last week, impacted my life in much bigger ways than my childhood hairdo. And she was so much more than just a Star Wars icon. \n \n She battled her own personal demons with courage and honesty. She gained strength and insight from her battles with drug and alcohol addiction and bipolar disorder and wrote about these struggles with wit in her memoirs and semi-autobiographical novels -- \"Postcards from the Edge,\" \"Wishful Drinking\" and most recently, \"The Princess Diarist.\" \n \n I finally sought therapy to deal with depression after reading about her own mental health struggles. Her memoirs inspired me to write more personal essays. \n \n In addition to her popular books, Fisher had a successful career as a script doctor during the '90s, working on such films as \"Hook,\" \"Sister Act,\" \"Lethal Weapon 3\" and \"The Wedding Singer.\" \n \n Since script doctors are rarely, if ever, credited on the films they save, many fans don't even realize the impact Fisher had on their favorite movies that don't involve lightsaber battles. Even Entertainment Weekly referred to Fisher as \"one of the most sought after doctors in town.\" \n \n I took screenwriting classes because I wanted to learn skills that Fisher had clearly put to good use as a script doctor. \n \n Of course, Fisher is best known as Princess Leia from the Star Wars films, but she her acting went way beyond a galaxy far, far away. She made her mark acting in some stellar comedies including \"Shampoo,\" \"The Blues Brothers,\" \"The Man with One Red Shoe,\" \"Hannah and Her Sisters,\" \"The 'Burbs\" and \"When Harry Met Sally.\" \n \n Fisher also appeared on numerous popular TV series including \"Sex in the City,\" \"The Big Bang Theory,\" \"Entourage,\" \"Family Guy,\" \"Robot Chicken,\" \"30 Rock,\" \"Weeds,\" \"Smallville\" and \"Frasier,\" to name a few. \n \n When I worked at Lucasfilm as a senior editor for the website StarWars.com, I was always honored when my path intersected with Fisher. Sometimes I'd be asked to walk her to panels at San Diego Comic-Con, or just make sure fans didn't get too unruly waiting in line for her autograph. \n \n One of my favorite memories of Fisher is the time a twenty-something hipster came up to her at one of her Comic-Con signings and demanded she write something unique and personal on a photo of Fisher dressed in her iconic Slave Leia metal bikini. She winked and wrote, \"Bite me.\" \n \n She always had a funny quip or story and was thrilled when fans would lavish her beloved dog Gary -- who she took with her everywhere -- with love and affection. \n \n Fisher didn't just pave the way for more beloved female Star Wars characters like Rey (\"The Force Awakens\") and Jyn Erso (\"Rogue One\") to inspire a new generation of fans, she also made me proud to be a geek girl who spoke her mind and went after her dreams no matter what challenges life threw my way. And for that I will always be grateful. \n \n She will be missed, but her Force will be strong in my memory, always. ||||| Ranked on a scale from 1 to 10, the trending score reflects the number of users reading a story in real time. \n \n What is this? ||||| (CNN) She may be best known for playing Princess Leia, but Carrie Fisher was so much more than that.

    "document": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Who is the most hated Star Wars character of all time? \n \n If you think it\u2019s Jar Jar Binks, youssa wrong. \n \n A new poll from Morning Consult just offered a clue as to which characters Star Wars fans favor and dislike the most. \n \n The poll, which surveyed 2,200 people, asked respondents to pick their favorite Star Wars character. Leia led the list with a 73 percent favorability rating. \n \n Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca, Yoda and R2-D2 were close behind, all within 2 percent of Leia. \n \n Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) escape from the Death Star in \u201cStar Wars: Episode IV A New Hope.\u201d \n \n Here\u2019s where it gets interesting: Anakin Skywalker received a 55 percent rating, while Darth Vader (who is Anakin Skywalker) received a 49 percent rating. \n \n \u201cThat appears to be the first evidence we've ever found that slaughtering Jedi children, torturing your daughter and cutting off your son's hand will only cost you a 6 percent dip in the polls,\u201d according to Mashable. \n \n A look at another part of the poll reveals the most hated character. None of the original trilogy characters made that list, all of them receiving at least 40 percent in favorability. \n \n And it wasn\u2019t Jar Jar Binks, who had a 37 percent approval rating (only one spot behind \"Force Awakens\" heroine Rey). As writer Chris Taylor for Mashable pointed out, according to the poll's statistics, Republican men seemed to really appreciate Jar Jar Binks. Draw your own conclusions from that. \n \n Jar Jar Binks finished ahead of Mace Windu, Kylo Ren, Emperor Palpatine, Jyn Erso and Wedge Antilles, too. (Though we wonder if this would change if people knew Jar Jar is secretly a Sith Lord). \n \n But it was Supreme Leader Snoke who bottomed out on the list with 26 percent. \n \n Snoke, who first appeared in \u201cThe Force Awakens,\" finished lower than Count Dooku (the villain from \u201cAttack of the Clones\u201d) and Donald Trump, who\u2019s favorability sits at 32 percent. \n \n The Morning Consult poll, which asked 2,200 people about their opinions on the Star Wars movies, also broke down the results by demographics and political preferences, providing a wealth of data that can be scavenged for weeks after the upcoming \"Last Jedi\" film drops. \n \n Examining how politics mix with Star Wars, statistics from the poll revealed that 53 percent of respondents don't consider Star Wars to be political, and that of the 17 percent who do, 41 percent are bothered by the series\u2019 political tone, according to Morning Consult. \n \n \u201cWhile the poll found a small minority of respondents who find the politics of Star Wars bothersome, among a number of enthusiasts, fanatics \u2014 and well, geeks \u2014 the movies\u2019 perceived political undercurrents have long been a source of fascination and fierce debate,\u201d according to a press release on the poll. ||||| Even if you were the kind of Star Wars true believer who found it impossible to like Jar Jar Binks, trust me: You\u2019d have an even harder time disliking Ahmed Best. We meet on a midsummer Sunday morning in Los Angeles. Best, now 43, is wearing a sky-blue Henley shirt, tan pants, and thick-framed black glasses. He is tall and fit, with an easy smile and a tattoo across his right arm that reads \u201cFighting Without Fighting\u201d\u2014a reference to Enter the Dragon, his second-favorite movie of all time (The Empire Strikes Back is number one). \u201cMy father was a martial arts teacher,\u201d Best says. \u201cAnd when my mom went into labor with me and my twin brother, he said, \u2018Let\u2019s go see Enter the Dragon.\u2019 When Bruce Lee came on the screen, I was like, \u2018It\u2019s time to get out this womb, and into the world.\u2019\u201d \n \n The week had been a busy one for Best. The night before, he\u2019d helped coordinate visuals for a multimedia live show celebrating the music of the late hip-hop producer J Dilla. And a few days before that, Best had launched The Afrofuturist Podcast, a new series in which he interviews authors, creators, and technologists about where things are heading. It\u2019s a show about the future that\u2019s closely linked to Best\u2019s past. \u201cFor Star Wars, I was a part of this new hybrid-performance technology that eventually ended up changing movies,\u201d he says. \u201cThat put me in this very, very forward-thinking mindset.\u201d \n \n Best has been interested in technology since childhood. He spent his early years in the Bronx before his family relocated to Maplewood, New Jersey. \u201cGrowing up, I wanted to be a mechanical engineer, or a computer scientist, or a physicist,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize you could do a bunch of stuff and be a polymath, because at that time everybody was like, \u2018Figure out that one thing that you\u2019re great at, and do that one thing.\u2019\u201d \n \n As it turned out, Best was pretty great at computers: He learned BASIC programming, started working with music software, and, along with a friend, sold books via a rudimentary retail site he launched (and quickly abandoned) in the early \u201990s. \u201cPeople we were hanging out with were like, \u2018Whatever, nerds,\u2019\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cBut we saw the potential of the web really early on.\u201d \n \n In his late teens, Best moved on to music\u2014studying percussion, playing with the New York City-based acid-jazz collective Jazzhole, and eventually landing a role in the award-winning theatrical production Stomp. \u201cWe did an open call where about 600 people turned up to audition, and Ahmed stood out straight away,\u201d Stomp co-creator Luke Cresswell says. \u201cWe were looking for charisma and for people with something to say. And the best thing about Ahmed was the fact he was so confident and so self-assured. He could be loud, he could be opinionated. But those are all qualities that pushed him to where he is now.\u201d \n \n Best puts it a bit more bluntly: \u201cI was very arrogant in Stomp,\u201d he says. \u201cThe show came from street performers in Brighton, and British performers have always been a little bit acerbic, in a \u2018The fuck you looking at?\u2019 kind of way. And we were New York kids, street performers. So that [attitude] was right up our alley.\u201d \n \n By the spring of 1996, Best had earned a lead role in the show\u2019s San Francisco company. One night, Lucasfilm casting director Robin Gurland wound up in the audience, trying to find someone who could play a new kind of film character\u2014one that would be rendered digitally on-screen, but drawn from an actor\u2019s performance. The search was taking forever. \u201cJar Jar was one of the last roles we cast,\u201d Gurland says. \u201cI was looking for someone who could really sell the physical aspect of the character, but who also had the acting chops to give it a literal voice\u2014and it\u2019s very difficult to find that in one performer.\u201d \n \n Best didn\u2019t know Gurland was watching the performance, which was probably a good thing. That night, an out-of-town Stomper was visiting the city, so Best was relegated to a supporting role, leaving him fuming. \u201cI turned into an asshole that night,\u201d Best says. \u201cI thought, \u2018If you think you can out-anything on me onstage, you got another fucking thing coming, and I\u2019m going to prove it.\u2019 And I did. Had I been a little bit older, I would\u2019ve handled that a little bit more gracefully.\u201d \n \n But Best\u2019s show-offy turn wound up winning over Gurland. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take my eyes off him,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s an unknown quality that true performers have\u2014the ability to relate to an audience and to come across as if they\u2019re directing their performance to you specifically.\u201d She eventually invited him to Skywalker Ranch, where Best was squeezed into a tight-fitting motion-capture suit and asked to move about. (When Lucas himself eventually showed up, Best broke into what was once described as a \u201cbreak-dance glide.\u201d) Not long afterward, he was summoned overseas to begin his work as Jar Jar. His Star Wars saga had begun.",

    "document": "A computer model has found a smiling expression is key to a first impression of being approachable, while large eyes signal youthfulness, and dominance is linked partly to a masculine face shape. \n \n You may think you can judge a person you just met based on his or her facial expressions. Does a smile indicate a person is easygoing or insincere? Does squinting show concentration, or mistrust? \n \n First impressions of people \u2014 such as whether they are trustworthy, dominant or attractive \u2014 can develop from a glimpse as brief as 100 milliseconds or less. Brain scans suggests that such judgments are made automatically, probably outside of people's conscious control. \n \n But now, a computer system that mimics the human brain has identified which facial features most influence how others first perceive a person, scientists say.These findings could lead to computer programs that automatically see which photographs would help people give the best first impressions they can, the researchers added. \n \n Because first impressions can affect people's future behavior and can be difficult to overturn, \"it's useful to know how we're being judged on our appearance, especially since these judgments might not be accurate \u2014 think of effects on court cases or democratic elections, for example,\" said study co-author Tom Hartley, a cognitive neuroscientist and psychologist at the University of York in England. \"Should we really trust a smiling face?\" [Smile Secrets: 5 Things Your Grin Reveals About You] \n \n Although some previous research has suggested that there may be a kernel of truth in some first impressions, Hartley noted that people typically go too far with the judgments they develop from first impressions. \"For instance, someone with a young-looking face is judged to have other immature characteristics,\" Hartley said. \"Evidence is clear that often judging a book by its cover is just plain wrong, but we all do it.\" \n \n Given the increasing presence of faces on social media sites, first impressions could be more important than ever, Hartley suggested. \n \n \"Whereas, in the past, we got to know people through meeting them in the flesh, increasingly, our first contact is online, and our first impressions are based on the images we provide on social media profiles,\" Hartley told Live Science. \n \n Previous research has shown that \"the many different judgments characterizing first impressions tend to fall along three underlying dimensions,\" Hartley said. \"One is approachability \u2014 do they want to help me or to harm me? The next is dominance \u2014 can they help or harm me? The last is youthful-attractiveness \u2014 perhaps representing whether they would be a good romantic partner or rival.\" \n \n Judging images \n \n To learn more about how first impressions are formed, the research team at the University of York found 1,000 photographs of people on the Internet, and showed them to six volunteers. The participants rated their first impressions of the people in the photos on social traits such as trustworthiness and dominance. These images were typical of pictures seen every day, ranging widely in angle, lighting, ages, expressions, hairstyles and so on. \n \n Each face was broken down into 65 physical features, such as the shape of a person's jaw, mouth, eyes, cheekbones or eyebrows. The researchers then analyzed these faces using an artificial neural network, a kind of artificial intelligence computing system that mimics how the brain works. They had the neural network attempt to learn which facial physical features might be linked to first impressions of social traits. \n \n This modelsuggested \"that given enough data, we can accurately gauge people's likely impressions of a given image,\" Hartley said. \"If you're thinking about attaching a picture to their CV, r\u00e9sum\u00e9 or online dating profile, maybe you should take a look at our paper first!\" \n \n The model found that mouth shape and area were linked to approachability \u2014 unsurprisingly, a smiling expression is a key component of an impression of approachability. When it came to youthful-attractiveness, eye shape and area were important, in line with views linking relatively large eyes to a youthful appearance. Dominance was linked with features indicating a masculine face shape, such as eyebrow height, cheekbones, as well as color and texture differences that may relate to either masculinity or a healthy or tanned overall appearance. \n \n \"Our results suggest that some of the features that are associated with first impressions are linked to changeable properties of the face or setting that are specific to a given image,\" Hartley said. \"So, things like expression, pose, camera position, lighting can all, in principle, contribute alongside the structure of our faces themselves. In some ways, our model parallels or makes explicit the kinds of judgment that might be relevant to casting directors, animators and portrait photographers who select or manipulate images to create certain impressions.\" \n \n Wanna look more trustworthy? \n \n By reversing this process, the researchers created a model that generated cartoon faces depicting the typical characteristics of someone judged as having certain social traits. The researchers compared the results with those of 30 human judges, and found that these cartoon faces usually gave the first impressions they were designed to give. [7 Personality Traits You May Want to Change] \n \n Hartley suggested that future research might be able to use these findings \"to select an image which conveys a desirable impression, perhaps even automatically.\" \n \n However, Hartley noted that the researchers looked only at Caucasian faces in this study, to avoid possible confounding effects of race, though they are currently conducting cross-cultural studies to find out how culture impacts the results. \n \n \"We know that people process faces of other ethnicities differently from their own \u2014 this might be because of cultural stereotypes, but also more subtle things such as the level of experience we have with different kinds of variation in the face,\" Hartley said. \"As it's not practical to incorporate faces and judges from every possible geographic, cultural and ethnic background, we instead try to keep these factors fixed by focusing on one ethnic and cultural group at a time. We can then investigate the ways in which different groups rely on different facial features and perhaps reach different social judgments in a step-by-step way.\" \n \n In addition to looking across cultures, future studies can also \"use brain imaging to investigate how these social impressions are created in the brain,\" Hartley said. Another direction for research \"will be to look at ways in which first impressions can be influenced by directly manipulating specific features, and whether, with the knowledge we now have, we can influence people's social decisions by choosing images with particular characteristics,\" he added. \n \n The scientists detailed their findings online July 28 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

People's responses to 1,000 photographs were used to build the model \n \n Whether it's a curled lip or a keen cheekbone, we all make quick social judgements based on strangers' faces. \n \n Now scientists have modelled the specific physical attributes that underpin our first impressions. \n \n Small changes in the dimensions of a face can make it appear more trustworthy, dominant or attractive. \n \n The results, published in the journal PNAS, could help film animators or anyone looking to create an instant impression on a social network. \n \n Dr Tom Hartley, a neuroscientist at the University of York and the study's senior author, said the work added mathematical detail to a well-known phenomenon. \n \n \"If people are forming these first impressions, just based on looking at somebody's face, what is it about the image of the face that's giving that impression - can we measure it exactly?\" \n \n Three key dimensions of a first impression Approachability: how likely is this person to help (or hinder) me? \n \n Dominance: how capable is this person of carrying out those intentions? \n \n Attractiveness: is this person young and good looking - a potential romantic partner? \n \n Positive first impressions are especially important in a world dominated by social media, from LinkedIn to Tinder. \n \n Dr Hartley sees the commercial potential in applying his numerical model to the photos people use to present themselves online. \"It's obviously potentially very useful,\" he told the BBC. \n \n To make the calculations, each of 1,000 face photos from the internet was shown to at least six different people, who gave it a score for 16 different social traits, like trustworthiness or intelligence. \n \n Overall, these scores boil down to three main characteristics: whether a face is (a) approachable, (b) dominant, and (c) attractive. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Cartoon faces based on the new mathematical model, sliding along 3 scales: approachability, dominance and attractiveness \n \n By measuring the physical attributes of all 1,000 faces and putting them together with those scores, Dr Hartley and his team built a mathematical model of how the dimensions of a face produce those three impressions. \n \n The next step was to get the computer to extrapolate. Using their new model, the team produced cartoon versions of the most (and least) approachable, dominant and attractive faces - as well as all the possibilities in between. \n \n Image copyright T Hartley / PNAS Image caption Six faces and their computerised approximations, including study author Dr Tom Hartley (second from left) \n \n Image caption The same treatment given to the Today programme's John Humphrys \n \n You could use these kind of numbers to decide when is a good time to take a photograph, or to choose the photograph that's really optimal in putting forward the best possible impression Dr Tom Hartley, University of York \n \n Finally, and most importantly, these cartoon results could be tested. When the researchers quizzed more participants about their impressions of the artificial, cartoon faces, the ratings matched. People said that the computer's cartoon prediction of an approachable face was, indeed, approachable - and so on. \n \n So has all this work revealed humanity's ultimate trustworthy jawline, or the most assertive shape for eyebrows? Dr Hartley is cautious. \n \n \"Lots of the features of the face tend to vary together,\" he explained. \"So it's very difficult for us to pin down with certainty that a given feature of the face is contributing to a certain social impression.\" \n \n There are some obvious trends however - including the tendency for masculine faces to be perceived as dominant, or for a broadly smiling face to seem more approachable and trustworthy. \n \n This points to a potentially worrying implication: brief facial expressions can make a big difference to how we are received by strangers. \n \n \"It might be problematic if we're forming these kind of judgements based on these rather fleeting impressions,\" Dr Hartley said, \"particularly in today's world where we only might see one picture of a face, on social media, and have to form our impression based on that.\" \n \n Image copyright T Hartley / PNAS Image caption A mathematical model produced cartoon faces based on how people rated various facial dimensions \n \n On the other hand, the findings could help people put their best face forward. \n \n \"It might be very useful for organisations who are interested in people's faces,\" said Dr Hartley. \n \n [Being] approachable is tied to smiling expressions and unapproachable to frowning or angry expressions, while dominance is tied to masculine features Dr Anthony Little, University of Stirling \n \n That might include interests as diverse as photographers, Facebook and Pixar. \n \n \"You would be able to use these kind of numbers to decide when is a good time to take a photograph, or maybe to choose the photograph that's really optimal in putting forward the best possible impression - and you might want to put forward different kinds of social impressions in different situations.\" \n \n Animators, on the other hand, \"have to give life, and give some social meaning, to the faces of their characters just by changing small things,\" Dr Hartley said. \n \n \"What we're doing is trying to put that on a scientific footing. It's been fascinating to find out more about it.\" \n \n Dr Anthony Little, a reader in psychology at the University of Stirling, said the findings point to something \"simple and important\" about the way physical attributes guide our social responses. \n \n Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Impressions included attractiveness and trustworthiness - potential mate or used car salesman? \n \n \"The results highlight that the way we see other people may be in relatively simple terms, as approachable/unapproachable and dominant/submissive,\" said Dr Little, whose own research on faces and psychology includes using a website to crowd-source ratings. \n \n \"Each of these two factors looks to be tied to specific face features. So, approachable is tied to smiling expressions and unapproachable to frowning or angry expressions, while dominance is tied to masculine features. \n \n \"The third factor, youthful-attractiveness, appears less distinct.\" \n \n This is because of interplay between attractiveness and the other two factors, Dr Little explained. ||||| Within moments of meeting someone new, we've make both conscious and subconscious judgments about them\u2014even if we're just looking at a picture of them. First impressions largely hinge on a person's facial features, which we judge on three major axes: dominance, approachability and attractiveness. Now, researchers publishing in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences have revealed the underpinnings of our snap judgments. \n \n To create a model that could predict first impressions, the team first asked volunteers to record their first impression of more than 1,000 photos of people's faces, taken from the internet, the BBC reports. Then, the researchers built a model based on careful measurements of the faces combined with the respondents' first impressions. \n \n To test how accurate their program was, the researchers used it to generate cartoon faces representing different first impressions of dominance, approachability and attractiveness, the BBC continues. They asked volunteers to make judgments about both the cartoons and the real-life faces they represented and found that the impressions matched. \n \n The team thinks their findings could help animators create more convincing characters, as well as aid those looking to make a good first impression through an application photo or social network profile picture, the BBC adds.",

Using a computer model, researchers have figured out how different features affect our first impressions, the BBC reports. The system is based on 1,000 pictures of different faces gathered online. In a study, researchers had respondents give opinions of these faces, focusing on approachability, dominance, and attractiveness. Researchers then created a mathematical model that translated those opinions into distinct facial measurements\u2014an effort to \"crack the code of first impressions,\" notes Smithsonian. The result was a computer program that generates cartoon faces intended to be dominant or submissive, approachable or off-putting. Another batch of study subjects offered their opinions of the cartoons\u2014and they fit the computer's assessments. Masculine features and a good tan were apparently tied to the perception of dominance, while smiles were associated with approachability, LiveScience reports.

    "document": "And, it's off! \n \n Groupon priced its IPO last night at $20 a share and started trading this morning around $30. \n \n So, it's already been a hell of a ride. \n \n Right now, the big institutional investors who got the stock at $20 and swore up and down that they'd hold it forever are now gleefully flipping it to anyone who will buy it. \n \n And if I were a big institutional investor, I'd be doing exactly the same thing. \n \n There is NO WAY I would own Groupon's stock for the next few quarters at this price, given the business transition Groupon is currently undergoing. \n \n At ~$30 a share, Groupon's valuation is about $20 billion. If the next few quarters are as rough as I think they might be, the stock could easily trade down to ~$8 billion, or ~$12 a share. That's a long way down from here. \n \n Groupon's near-term upside, meanwhile, appears to be limited, at least based on the company's fundamentals. Groupon is already being valued at a fifth of Amazon's value. It has already picked the low-hanging fruit in its key markets. It is cutting back on marketing costs, which is bringing growth to a screeching halt. Its core business in the US is shrinking. And Groupon is already totally global--there aren't many new markets to roll out in. \n \n Long-term, I'm actually a Groupon bull. I think the company has discovered a huge new market, and its scale gives it a big barrier to entry. But that doesn't mean the ride will be smooth. \n \n Could Groupon, say, double from here over the next 6 months and never trade below this level again? \n \n Sure, it could. Anything's possible. But that doesn't seem likely. And, in any case, the risk/reward profile of 100% upside (25% probability) and ~75% downside just doesn't seem that compelling. \n \n So, enjoy the ride, Groupon shareholders! I'll be watching the next act from the sidelines. \n \n WHY COULD THE STOCK GET CRUSHED OVER THE NEXT FEW QUARTERS? \n \n Over short-term time frames, two factors drive stock prices: \n \n Some market observers like to pretend that all stocks have a precise value that analysts can determine by studying the company and then running the right numbers. \n \n This is a crock. \n \n The theoretical value of any stock is the \"present value of future cash flows.\" And that means that, to estimate the intrinsic value of the stock, you have to know two things: \n \n The future cash flows \n \n The rate at which to discount the cash flows to get a \"present value.\" \n \n Regardless of what you may think from watching financial TV, no one knows either of these things. And how could they? We have no idea what Groupon's cash flow will be this quarter, let alone two years from now or 10 years from now or 50 years from now, all of which count in the \"present value\" calculation. We also don't know what the \"right\" discount rate is. And adjusting the discount rate by even a percentage point or two makes a huge difference in the present value calculation. \n \n So don't believe anyone who tells you they know what Groupon's worth. They don't. All they know is what their estimate is of what Groupon is worth. And, unfortunately, the range of \"reasonable\" estimates of what Groupon (or any stock) is worth is wide enough to fly a 787 through. \n \n But still, we have to try. \n \n So let's start with the big picture. \n \n The big picture is this: \n \n Groupon generated ~$300 million of revenue last year and should generate about $1.7 billion of revenue this year . \n \n . Groupon is now operating basically at break-even , with the North American business earning a modest profit and the international business losing a modest amount. \n \n , with the North American business earning a modest profit and the international business losing a modest amount. Groupon is cash-flow positive and has ~$1 billion in the bank \n \n Groupon's growth rate is decelerating sharply, and this deceleration is likely to continue for at least several more quarters. \n \n Based on my experience (15 or so years of following tech stocks), that last factor is very important. \"Momentum\" investors HATE deceleration. And momentum investors have a big impact on the prices at which stocks trade. So we need to keep the deceleration in mind. \n \n In fact, let's start with the deceleration, because it will have a big impact on our fundamental estimates for the next couple of years. \n \n The reason Groupon's growth is decelerating is: \n \n the law of large numbers \u2014 the company's already huge, and the company is cutting back on marketing spending \n \n The second factor is very important. To become meaningfully profitable, Groupon will have to continue to clamp down on marketing. And this will likely lead to further deceleration. \n \n Here's a chart from Yipit that shows Groupon's deceleration. Growth is screeching to a halt: \n \n Yipit \n \n There may be another factor at work in the deceleration, which is \"daily deal fatigue,\" as the novelty of Groupon's offering wears off. We need to keep that one in mind, too. \n \n WARNING: Deceleration Can Be Hazardous To Your Wealth \n \n Now, in my experience, when companies decide to transition from hyper-growth-and-losses to sustainable-growth-and-profitability, as Groupon is, the transition can be very rough. \n \n Importantly for this exercise, it also can be absolute hell on stock prices. \n \n The example that jumps to mind is Amazon.com. \n \n From 1996-2000, Amazon grew like a bat out of hell, in part because it was spending boatloads of money on marketing. In 2000, however, the funding markets for unprofitable Internet companies dried up, and Amazon had to change tack and focus on becoming profitable. This transition took two years, from 2000-2002. It led to major deceleration in the business. And it was absolutely brutal on Amazon's stock price. \n \n Specifically, as Amazon cut back on marketing spending and other profligate expenses in its drive to become profitable, the stock collapsed more than 95%, from $100+ to, if memory serves, about $6 a share. See the right half of the chart below. \n \n The painful transition from growth to profits: Amazon's stock price, 1997-2001. Google Finance \n \n Importantly, through this period, Amazon kept growing. It's just that its growth rate slowed sharply. \n \n During this period, Amazon also had some problems that Groupon probably won't, which is that many investors were convinced it could \"never make money\" and was going to \"go bankrupt.\" Groupon's most recent quarter should have helped put these concerns about Groupon to rest. \n \n But Groupon's deceleration is a big issue for the stock price. Such a big issue, in fact, that I personally would not even consider buying the stock unless/until one of two things happened: \n \n The growth rate stabilized \n \n The stock price was so low that I felt like my downside was limited regardless of what happened to the growth rate. \n \n So where will Groupon's growth rate stabilize? \n \n One could certainly make the case that Groupon's growth rate will eventually go negative \u2014 the company will begin to shrink \u2014 because management will be forced to cut back so sharply on marketing costs. \n \n I think that's probably too negative a scenario. Groupon already has a huge base of email subscribers \u2014 150 million \u2014 that it can market to for free. And the company should also be able to continue to spend $150+ million per quarter on marketing. And when revenue grows, the company should be able to increase this spending. \n \n So I think it's reasonable to assume that Groupon's growth rate will settle in the mid single-digits (sequential), which might translate to 20%-30% year-over-year growth. \n \n That transition will probably take a couple of quarters to play out. \n \n One, Two, Three ... Estimate! \n \n So now let's sketch out some numbers. \n \n If Groupon ends this year with a $500 million quarter, it will be operating at a $2 billion revenue run-rate. If the company can grow 20%+ next year off this run-rate, it would post 2012 revenue of ~$2.5 billion. And if it can grow another 20% in 2013, it will post 2013 revenue of about $3 billion. \n \n And what about profits? \n \n I realize I'm probably in the minority here, but I think Groupon will eventually have a nicely profitable business. The North American business had a 12% operating profit margin in Q3, and I think there's probably upside from there (there's also plenty of downside, obviously). \n \n International will likely drag the company's overall margin down for some time. But I think it's reasonable to assume that Groupon might generate a 10% operating profit margin in 2012 and a 15% operating margin in 2013. \n \n So what does that give us for preliminary estimates? \n \n 2012 Revenue: ~$2.5 billion Operating Profit (assuming 10% margin): $250 million Net Income (assuming 35% tax rate): ~$150 million \n \n 2013 Revenue: ~$3 billion Operating Profit (assuming 15% margin): ~$450 million Net Income (assuming 35% tax rate): ~$300 million \n \n So what might the stock be \"worth\" on those estimates? \n \n A fast-growing market-leader with a huge global opportunity should eventually trade at 20X-30X earnings. More in the early years, when the growth rate is faster and the company has not yet achieved its steady-state profit margin, less in the later years. \n \n So if Groupon were to trade at, say, 20X-30X 2013 earnings of $300 million, it would trade in a valuation range of $6 billion to $9 billion, with a central value of $7.5 billion. This would equate to a range of about $9-$13 per share. \n \n Notably, that's well below where the stock is trading. \n \n So ... Groupon Already Looks Overvalued \n \n Could Groupon do much better than that scenario? \n \n Of course it could. \n \n Its growth rate could stabilize at, say, 40%, and it could become much more profitable than I currently think. \n \n Goldman Sachs, who helped take the company public, thinks Groupon's revenue will grow at 40% for the next two years and that the company will have a 30% profit margin in 2013. Goldman thinks this will enable Groupon to earn almost $1 a share in 2013. If Groupon actually hits those numbers, or exceeds them, the stock's current valuation looks more reasonable. \n \n Of course, Groupon could also do much worse than my scenario. \n \n Namely, it could stop growing, and, thanks to competition or pushback from merchants, it could have a much lower profit margin than I think. And it could therefore be worth much less than the $6-$9 billion range I laid out. \n \n I think there's as much chance that the negative-case scenario will play out over the next couple of years than the positive-case one. So I would only consider buying the stock at a discount to \"base case\" scenario I outlined above. \n \n So, What's Groupon Worth? \n \n So what might I be willing to pay for Groupon's stock? \n \n Right now, based on the information I have and the assumptions I've made above, I wouldn't buy Groupon's stock unless it were trading at or below $5 billion (~$7 a share). This is in part because of the \"deceleration\" pattern I described above and in part because of the high level of riskiness I think goes along with owning the stock. \n \n So if I were managing a big institutional fund, here's what I would do: \n \n I'd have placed an order on the IPO for 1 million shares \n \n I'd have gotten my allocation of, say, 200,000 shares \n \n I'd have already flipped the stock to other investors \n \n (It's great to be a big institutional investor.) \n \n Then I would sit on the sidelines and watch Groupon and Groupon's stock for a couple of quarters. \n \n And if Groupon's growth rate stabilized at 40%-50%, I'd say, \"you dope \u2014 you missed a big opportunity.\" \n \n And if Groupon's growth rate stabilized where I thought it would or below, I'd say, \"Glad we dodged that bullet.\" \n \n And, of course, as time went by, I'd keep running new estimates, which I would compare to Groupon's stock price. And if the stock price ever dropped to a level relative to those estimates in which I thought I had a nice margin of safety in buying the stock, I'd buy it. \n \n After all, Groupon does seem to have identified a massive new e-commerce opportunity, and I'd like to go along for that ride. \n \n But that's me. And it's not a stock recommendation. I have no idea what your particular circumstances and investment goals are, and I couldn't care less whether or not you buy the stock. \n \n (And I should add here that, for me, at least, this exercise is totally academic. I don't buy individual stocks. I don't buy them because, having been a Wall Street insider for a decade, I learned firsthand just how much of a disadvantage most outsiders are at. I also learned that even the smartest, best-informed insiders are wrong about 50% of the time. And I learned that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the most intelligent investment strategy for part-time investors not paid to manage someone else's money is to assemble a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds. And that's what I've done for myself. So, beyond the entertainment value, I really couldn't care less what Groupon's stock does.) \n \n SEE ALSO: Congratulations, Groupon! ||||| Getty Images \n \n Holy stock pop. \n \n In its first minutes as a public company, Groupon\u2019s stock soared about 40% from its $20-a-share IPO price. \n \n Groupon shares in morning trading bumped around, trading as high as 56% above the IPO price.

Entitled Google Security Rewards - 2015 Year in Review, the report reveals the financial rewards that have been paid out in the last 12 months. \n \n In all, Google has paid out more than $2 million to more than 300 people, but Sanmay Ved is probably one of the more interesting reward recipients. He's the guy who -- very briefly -- managed to buy Google.com before having it taken off his hands. Google offered him a $6,006.13 reward, but there's a little more to the story. \n \n If you're wondering about the slightly strange amount, Google explains that if you squint and use a little imagination, the figure spells out the word Google. Sanmay decided to donate his reward to charity, and when Google learned about this, the reward was doubled. While Sanmay may have been one of the more unusual reward recipients, Tomasz Bojarski got the crown for the most prolific, discovering no fewer than 70 bugs on Google. \n \n 2015 was the year that Android was added to the to the Security Reward program initiative resulting in payments of over $200,000 to researchers. Google shares a graphic that shows some of the highlights from 2015: \n \n In 2015, Google's Vulnerability Research Grants was used to provide researchers with the funds they need to carry out their work. One example of how these funds were used includes research into a YouTube problem: \n \n We\u2019ve already seen positive results from this program; here\u2019s one example. Kamil Histamullin a researcher from Kasan, Russia received a VRP grant early last year. Shortly thereafter, he found an issue in YouTube Creator Studio which would have enabled anyone to delete any video from YouTube by simply changing a parameter from the URL.

The purpose of these grants is to ensure that researchers are rewarded for their hard work, even if they don\u2019t find a vulnerability. \n \n \n \n \n \n We\u2019ve already seen positive results from this program; here\u2019s one example.

Stay tuned for more exciting reward program changes throughout the year. ||||| Google \n \n Google shelled out some cash last fall after losing and regaining ownership of Google.com. Now the company has revealed how much the slip-up cost. \n \n Former Google employee Sanmay Ved purchased Google.com for $12 at 1:20 a.m. ET on September 29. He bought the domain name on the Google Domains registration service website after the company somehow lost ownership of it. \n \n He owned Google.com for one minute. The transaction was reversed when Google sent Ved a cancellation order, which returned ownership to the company. \n \n Conflicts over domain ownership aren't always settled amicably or cheaply. So-called domain squatters often try to get ahead of potential, hypothetical products and register domain names -- say, \"Appleflyingcar.com\" -- on the cheap in hopes of netting a big sale to the company that needs the site. Or they may create a website name that combines a celebrity's name and a word like \"naked.\" \n \n In this case, it seems Google may have missed a deadline to renew Google.com, creating an opportunity for someone to slip in and nab it. Neither Google nor Ved has publicly revealed exactly how the domain name became available. \n \n In a security blog post Thursday, the company revealed that it wanted to give Ved $6,006.13. Look at the amount as letters instead of numbers, and it comes close to spelling \"google.\" \"Squint a little and you'll see it!\" Google said. \n \n Google doubled that offer after Ved said he would donate the money to charity, both the company and Ved said, though neither specified the exact figure. \n \n Google's payout ended up going to the Art of Living India foundation, which runs free schools for children in poverty-stricken areas of India. \n \n Now playing: Watch this: Masters of a new domain \n \n Ved, whose LinkedIn account describes him as an MBA candidate at Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, detailed the incident in a post there last fall. He noted that Google was able to reverse the transaction because it owned the Google Domains registration service. \n \n Microsoft bumped into a similar issue in 2003 when it lost ownership of the Hotmail.co.uk website, The Register reported at the time. The software giant failed to cancel the transaction. However, the person who bought the domain name returned it the same day. ||||| Exclusive Microsoft was busy covering up an almighty cock-up last night after forgetting to renew its hotmail.co.uk domain name. \n \n Despite being warned that the domain for its popular Web mail service was up for renewal, it seems Microsoft - or whoever had the task of managing its hotmail.co.uk domain - overlooked this vital piece of administration. \n \n As a result, last month Microsoft lost its claim to the domain and it was duly returned to the open market to be picked up by whomever fancied it \n \n Luckily, the domain was snapped up on the same day - October 23. The new owner - a good hearted soul - then proceeded immediately to contact Microsoft, inform the giant of its slip and arrange to hand back the domain. \n \n However, Microsoft didn't want to know. Despite phone calls and emails - and being fobbed off by Microsoft drones - our man behind this public-spirited deed was completely blanked by the software empire. \n \n Microsoft only took notice when The Register contacted the company yesterday afternoon to enquire why its hotmail.co.uk site was registered to a private individual. \n \n It was then we were told that the matter was under investigation and being \"escalated\". Worryingly, no one in the UK could deal with the matter so it was up to the US to sort things out. \n \n Of course, while Microsoft's spinstresses tried to stall for time, the company was busy scurrying behind the scenes to sort out this embarrassing episode. It managed to contact hotmail.co.uk's new owner, grovel at their mistake and sort out the mess. By all accounts, hotmail.co.uk will be returned in a few days. \n \n A spokeswoman for Nominet UK - the registry for all .uk domains - confirmed that hotmail.co.uk had failed to be renewed and was placed back into pool of available domains. \n \n For Nominet's part, she confirmed that \"all the standard renewal procedures were followed regarding hotmail.co.uk\". \n \n \"I would like to remind companies and their agents that it is their responsibility to renew their domains,\" she said. \n \n Despite repeated attempts to seek comment from Microsoft, the software giant has failed to cobble together any form of statement that might shed light on this situation. \n \n In December 1999, Microsoft forgot to renew the domain name Passport.com, and so rendered its Hotmail service partially crippled. A Linux programmer, Michael Chaney, paid the $35 fee and promptly handed over ownership to Microsoft.

A nice footnote: When Ved elected to donate his award to charity\u2014it went to this education foundation\u2014Google doubled it.

I'll start with the positive: I quite like the ice cream selection, er, it's actually more of an \"ice milk\" than cream, like Dairy Queen, but we're all used to that by now. Typical soft serve, nothing to phone home about, but it's fine. They've got all the stuff you'd expect to find at DQ, so not bad a bad stop for an ice cream fix. However, I'd veer away from the cooked food. They claim the burgers are hand made, not frozen, and I'm sure that may be true...there's plenty of butchers nearby that could be providing fresh meat. The only issue is, they're screwing the burgers up...they're super gritty, greasy, and don't have any seasoning/flavor to speak of. You can put toppings on which makes it ok, but really nothing worth stopping for. Most other items on the menu are just defrosted, deep fried, and awful. The cheese curds could be good...but they don't drain the oil off so by the time they get to you they're all stuck together and soggy. One thing I do kind of like is the Sloppy Joe, or \"Sloppy Dan\" as it's referred to here, which I believe is also supposed to be an in-house recipe. It's decent. My mom's is better...but hey, she's hard to beat. Also, there's something odd about the third-rate non-name-brand fountain soda they have, it seems the syrup was frozen or something, as it tastes freezer-burnt. Why would you freeze syrup? Something isn't quite right there, maybe it's just really bad soda. What keeps me from going back at all even for the decent ice cream is the service, frankly. Customer service skills are lacking in everyone who works here, from the young kids they hire all the way to the owners - except maybe the wife as an exception, she's usually pretty nice. No one else seems to be enjoying their time there. This isn't a cheap political shot since the owner is very political, you'll see lawn signs all over the place and while I think whatever floats your boat, it shows a lack of business know-how (who would alienate half their customers) and makes me wonder how the judgement is in the rest of his business decisions. It's genuinely true that the environment isn't pleasant. Most importantly, if there's more than one person in the restaurant, it can also take a long time to be served or for your food to be made. Should you decide to try for yourself, my recommendation is to call ahead, and just pick it up through the drive thru window....as there's nothing special about the decor or hospitality. I believe the owner delivers the food locally as well, but you'd have to call and ask if that's still the case.",

    "document": "The now-retired federal judge who struck down California's ban on same-sex marriage shared his reflections with reporters for the first time Wednesday, saying that the trial should have been televised and that he never considered stepping aside because he is gay. \n \n \"If you thought a judge's sexuality, ethnicity, national origin (or) gender would prevent the judge from handling a case, that's a very slippery slope,\" former Chief U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker told reporters in a conference room at the San Francisco courthouse where he served for 21 years. \n \n \"I don't think it's relevant,\" he said. \n \n Independent thinker \n \n Walker, 67, who retired from the bench at the end of February, also said he thinks his ruling was correct and he hopes higher courts review the case on its merits. \n \n He discussed the case in his first meeting with reporters since he announced his retirement in September. \n \n A former corporate lawyer who was appointed to the bench by President George H.W. Bush, Walker proved to be an independent thinker - a libertarian who advocated decriminalization of drugs and issued groundbreaking rulings limiting government power and expanding individual rights. \n \n His most prominent ruling was his August decision overturning Proposition 8, the November 2008 initiative that amended the state Constitution to outlaw same-sex marriage. \n \n Same-sex-marriage ruling \n \n After a 12-day trial that included testimony by gay and lesbian couples and experts on the history and purpose of marriage, Walker ruled that Prop. 8 discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation and gender and did not benefit heterosexual spouses or the marital institution. \n \n The measure's sponsors have asked a federal appeals court to overturn the ruling, but the court has questioned whether the sponsors have legal standing - the right to represent the state's interests - after then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Attorney General Jerry Brown declined to appeal. \n \n Walker first raised that issue in August, citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision that expressed doubt about whether sponsors of an initiative can stand in for state officials. But he said Wednesday he'd prefer to see the appeals court decide whether Prop. 8 is unconstitutional. \n \n If Prop. 8 is invalidated because no one has the standing to defend it, he said, it will leave \"a sense of the issue not having been resolved.\" \n \n The Chronicle first disclosed Walker's sexual orientation during the trial, a fact he had neither discussed publicly nor tried to conceal. He said Wednesday he'd been surprised that it hadn't surfaced earlier and had surmised that \"every journalist had decided it was not news.\" \n \n The disclosure prompted some opponents of same-sex marriage to accuse Walker of bias and demand that he disqualify himself. Walker noted Wednesday that no parties in the case, including Prop. 8's sponsors, ever made such a request, and said, \"I never thought it was appropriate to recuse from that case.\" \n \n Television coverage \n \n Walker also tried to have the trial televised as part of a pilot project approved by the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, but the Supreme Court intervened at the request of the measure's sponsors, who said their witnesses might back out for fear of retribution if they knew a large audience would be watching. \n \n The high court said Walker had failed to give enough advance public notice and also questioned whether such a high-profile case should be telecast. But Walker said Wednesday that trials of great public interest - Prop. 8, or the current Barry Bonds perjury trial - are the ones that should be most visible outside the courtroom. \n \n \"We are supposed to have public trials in this country,\" he said, and the only way that can happen now is \"to admit the public by their eyes and ears.\" \n \n Walker said the Supreme Court may have been motivated by its unwillingness to televise its own proceedings - a stance he called \"very hard to understand.\" Camera coverage would expose Americans to a range of arguments and the high quality of lawyers and the court system, he said. \n \n Walker is returning to private law practice as head of a San Francisco firm that will specialize in mediation, arbitration and other alternatives to litigating complex civil cases. Those were his most satisfying cases as a judge, he said. \n \n He was also the judge who ruled the George W. Bush administration's warrantless wiretapping of suspected terrorists illegal and rejected Apple Computer's claim that Microsoft Corp. had illicitly copied Apple Macintosh features in the Windows operating system. \n \n But Walker said his favorite trial was the 2000 case in which he approved Hearst Corp.'s purchase of The Chronicle. It had everything, he said - local color, meaty antitrust issues, surprising testimony, and political and journalistic intrigue. \n \n \"If every trial were like that, I'd stay forever,\" he said. \n \n This article appeared on page A - 1 of the San Francisco Chronicle ||||| Should judge have recused himself on Prop. 8?

The San Francisco Chronicle has reported that the fact that Judge Walker \"is himself gay\" is the \"biggest open secret\" in town. The BuzzTab blog calls him \"the apple of gay advocators eyes.\" The Los Angeles Times reported just last month, after the conclusion of closing arguments in the case, that he is \"openly gay\" and \"attends bar functions with a companion, a physician.\" \n \n Is any of this relevant to Judge Walker's ruling striking down Proposition 8? \n \n Well, as University of Notre Dame law Professor Gerard Bradley recently noted, the mere fact that Judge Walker may be homosexual would not necessarily have required recusal. But the fact that he \"attends bar functions with a companion, a physician,\" and may therefore be in a stable homosexual relationship of the kind that could lead to marriage, is an entirely different matter. \n \n The political philosopher John Locke noted in his Second Treatise on Civil Government that \"it is unreasonable for men to be judges in their own cases (because) self-love will make men partial to themselves and their friends.\" That sentiment, undoubtedly true, is actually codified in federal law. A judge is required to disqualify himself in any proceeding \"in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned, including but not limited to instances in which: (a) the judge has ... personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding; [or] ... (c) the judge knows that the judge ... has a financial ... or any other interest that could be affected substantially by the outcome of the proceeding.\" \n \n If Judge Walker is indeed in a long-term, same-sex relationship, he certainly has an \"interest that could be affected substantially by the outcome of the proceeding\" - he and his partner are now permitted to marry! - and that, according to Judge Walker's own finding, has financial benefits as well. Such conflicts would have required recusal, and cannot be waived by the parties. \n \n If the relationship does not create such a conflict, it nevertheless creates the circumstance \"in which the judge's impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\" That ground for disqualification can be waived by the parties, but the judge must \"disclose on the record the basis of the disqualification\" and then only continue after the parties have agreed in writing to his continued involvement. No such disclosure and agreement occurred in this case. \n \n Judge Walker's failure to disqualify himself or at least to disclose his potentially disqualifying relationship to the parties requires that the opinion in the case be vacated and a new trial conducted before a different judge. In Liljeberg vs. Health Services Acquisition Corp., the Supreme Court held that the original judgment had to be set aside even when the disqualifying relationship only became known to the parties 10 months after the judgment entered in the case had been upheld on appeal. Where an objective observer would have questioned the judge's impartiality, recusal is required, and the appropriate remedy is to annul the judgment because of the risk of injustice to the parties and of undermining the public's confidence in the judicial process. \n \n Given the high-profile nature of this case, the threat to the public's confidence in the judicial process is particularly acute. Judge Walker has unilaterally neutered the votes of more than 7 million Californians. A contentious step under the best of circumstances, such a decision should only be rendered, if at all, by a judge whose impartiality is beyond reproach. Judge Walker's, unfortunately, is not. ||||| g'day m8 \n \n Acknowledging his sexuality for the first time in public, Vaughn Walker, who left the U.S. District Court bench in February, and who declared Prop 8 unconstitutional and is now seeing his court ruling bandied about on appeal, told reporters today that not only is he a big \u2018mo, but he\u2019s also been in a relationship with his partner for 10 years. As for the argument that gay judges can somehow not rule on cases involving sexuality, Walker takes the same position Queerty always has: immutable characteristics like sexuality, race, and gender are not judicial conflicts of interest.

He attended a meeting of experts from the transport ministry and the company that manages bridge repairs on 1 February. \n \n Minutes of the meeting, which bear Mr Ferrazza\u2019s signature, recommended that the supports be reinforced given the \u201ctrend of degradation\u201d being registered. \n \n Bidding opened in April for the \u20ac20m (\u00a318m) public works contract to do the work, according to Italian media. \n \n The Morandi Bridge was a key artery that linked highways to Milan and France, a vital lifeline for both commercial traffic as well as vacationers bound for the mountains and Mediterranean beaches. \n \n Shape Created with Sketch.

The BBC reports that Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte presided over a state funeral for nearly 20 of the victims over the weekend, though some families rejected the public overtures, either wanting to mourn privately or because they were fuming at the government for the tragedy. \"We do not want farcical ceremonies,\" one family member told a local newspaper. \"Our children are not a tool for public parades.\" Meanwhile, via the Independent, a 1979 report has emerged from the bridge's engineer that warned about deterioration risks.

    "document": "DeAndre Jordan had a playoff career high of 25 points as the Clips took a 3-2 series lead over the Warriors. Andrew D. Bernstein/Getty Images /Getty Images \n \n LOS ANGELES -- A little before 8 p.m. on Tuesday, Clippers power forward Blake Griffin caught an entry pass on the left block, dribbled to the middle of the key, and was fouled across the arm by Golden State's Draymond Green. There was nothing notable about the play, nothing the least bit memorable, except for the fact that it happened at all. \n \n Had Commissioner Adam Silver not stood before a bank of cameras in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday morning, had he not banished Donald Sterling from the league for life, and had he not vowed that the disgraced owner will be forced to sell the franchise, Griffin never would have made that move to the paint. DeAndre Jordan never would have made that dunk that shook the stanchion. Chris Paul never would have made that pass that froze three defenders. Matt Barnes never would have scuffled with Andre Iguodala, Stephen Curry never would have turned a 2-on-1 fast break into a pull-up three, and Jamal Crawford never would have sank an and-one falling out of bounds . \n \n The Clippers never would have beaten the Warriors in Game 5, 113-103, because the teams never would have played. Those were the stakes for Silver on Tuesday. Either kick Sterling to the side, forever, or watch the Clippers and Warriors walk off the court in protest moments before a nationally televised showdown. \"It was a real option,\" said Warriors coach Mark Jackson. It was more than that. It was a plan. \"I'm sure people would have stuck to it,\" Green said, \"if things didn't go well.\" \n \n MCCANN: Sterling, NBA set for epic legal fight over Clippers \n \n What actually transpired was almost as surreal. Clippers staffers wore all black. Clippers cheerleaders wore all black. Every advertisement in the arena was covered by black fabric. You'd have seen more sponsors at a high-school game. The mood was simultaneously angry and elated, as if Staples Center was hosting a coup, narrated by the Clippers DJ and hostess. Some fans wore T-shirts with pictures of Sterling's face crossed out, over messages such as \"Sterling out equality in\" and \"No room for racism.\" Signs included \"I'm here for Griffin not Sterling\"....\"Get out Sterling\"...\"For sale racists need not apply\"... \"Sterling might own the team for now but they belong to us.\" \n \n All those images, plus the posters of Magic Johnson and the renderings of Sterling with devils horns, were broadcast on the Jumbotron. Sterling's own organization, from players to coaches to the entertainment staff, turned on him. \"We are home!\" the fist-pumping DJ bellowed over deep bass. \"We are one!\" That mantra -- chanted periodically throughout the fourth quarter -- was written in black and white on the LED boards between the suite levels, taking the place of the ads. \"It's a great day,\" said Paul. Oddly, it might have been the best day in the history of the franchise. \n \n Clippers coach Doc Rivers informed his team of Sterling's punishment during a film session at morning shoot-around. \"There was nothing in the room,\" Rivers said. \"It was complete silence.\" It was the sound of satisfaction. \"You could be making nothing,\" Rivers continued. \"You want to work for someone who at least shares your values or respects them -- especially when you're working for a company where, when you do your job, you have it on your chest. I get the sense that was very hard for the players. They had to wear it.\" \n \n MANNIX: Silver did what absolutely needed to be done with ban of Sterling \n \n But on Tuesday, unlike Sunday, they didn't ditch their shooting shirts. They didn't flip anything inside-out. When they took the floor for warm-ups to a standing ovation, they were handed note-cards with the words, \"We Love You\" and their names. \"It was one of the most emotional things I've ever been a part of it,\" Paul said. \"We have a tough locker room and a lot of us are tough. But it almost brought tears to your eyes to feel the support.\" \n \n They were greeted by Jesse Jackson, lingering in front of Sterling's usual seat, and they also saw Sterling's wife, Shelly, flanked by six bodyguards. Shelly called Rivers on Tuesday and requested permission to attend. \"I thought that was a very nice gesture,\" he said. Shelly asked Rivers to tell the players she loved them. \n \n Fans were initially encouraged to boycott the game, even by Mark Jackson. But Silver brought back players and patrons alike, turning a protest into a rally, and another reminder that sports franchises transcend the suits that purchase them. No one buys a jersey with an owner's name on the back. No one lines up for an owner's autograph. No one hangs an owner's Fathead. Sterling may have defined the Clippers when they had nobody else. Now, they are defined by Griffin, Paul, Jordan, and the dozens of dedicated employees who make the club hum. Many people have worked many years to make the Clipper logo a point of pride instead of embarrassment. They shouldn't have to wear it inside-out. And they certainly shouldn't have to miss a playoff date when there have been so few. \n \n ROSENBERG: Sterling's lifetime ban fits the crime and the man \n \n The Clippers' 138th straight sellout crowd -- termed by Rivers \"as good as I've ever seen\" -- saw the home team capture a game they controlled from the moment Silver grabbed the microphone in New York. Jordan, who went scoreless in Game 4, texted his coach before Game 5 to say: \"That wasn't me.

The commissioner said \"I fully expect\" to get the needed three-quarters of the league's owners -- meaning at least 23 -- to back the move, though Sterling could fight any such move in court. \n \n If Sterling does sell the team, he stands to profit considerably: He bought the Clippers for $12 million in 1981, and the team is now worth $575 million, according to Forbes magazine. And he'd likely have plenty of suitors: Among them is Hollywood mogul David Geffen, who spokeswoman Priscila Giraldo says is \"interested\" in buying the team. \n \n Rather than water cooler discussions of exciting NBA playoff action, people are talking about racist remarks by a team owner, said Gabe Feldman, head of Tulane University's sports law program. \n \n Estimating the team may be worth closer to $1 billion, Feldman added, \"He may get a lot of money from the sale, but I think it will allow the NBA to shift their focus.\" \n \n That's what Clippers coach Doc Rivers said Tuesday night, commending Silver as \"fantastic\" for making \"a decision that really was the right one.\" While the players aren't rejoicing, they are breathing easier knowing what happened earlier in the day, he said. \n \n \"They were just happy that it was a resolution,\" Rivers said, expressing hope that playing the game will be a \"safe haven\" for all involved. \"... We're all in a better place because of this.\" \n \n Clippers: 'Now the healing process begins' \n \n The inflammatory sentiments Silver referred to came packaged in a 10-minute recording that TMZ said occurred during an April 9 conversation between Sterling and girlfriend V. Stiviano \n \n On the recording, a man and woman argue about photos posted to Instagram in which she appears with African-Americans. The man says he doesn't want the woman bringing any black people to games with her. \n \n The sports website Deadspin on Sunday posted five additional minutes of what it said was part of the same audio recording. \n \n Neither website has said how it obtained the recordings; Stiviano's lawyer's office said Sunday that she didn't release them to TMZ, while stating they are legitimate. \n \n On Saturday, Clippers President Andy Roeser suggested the audio was aimed at \"getting even\" with Sterling over a lawsuit. \n \n JUST WATCHED Ex-NBAer 'very pleased' Sterling is gone Replay More Videos ...

Some observers question how comments, made privately, could serve as grounds for such punishment, including possibly forcing him to sell the team. \n \n Yet while there's no precedent in the NBA, there is in other sports. In the 1990s, Major League Baseball repeatedly suspended Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott over racist and other controversial comments, and she ultimately sold the franchise. \n \n Silver said Tuesday he'd \"let the lawyers\" address specifics, while stating flatly, \"We have the authority to act as I've recommended.\" \n \n Feldman said some owners might be wary of setting a precedent in which anyone can be voted out \"just based on something they don't like, whether it was said privately or just said publicly.\" That view notwithstanding, NBA owners universally backed Silver's judgment in statements Tuesday. \n \n If the owners follow through on the commissioner's recommendation to force him to sell, Sterling could fight back in the courts. But should he file a lawsuit, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin says his chances of success seem \"basically zero.\" \n \n Sterling so far hasn't had found support in the court of public opinion, especially among past and present players. \n \n JUST WATCHED NAACP: Don Sterling must pay a price Replay More Videos ...

Stiviano. \n \n Members of his own team, the Clippers, debated boycotting their playoff game Saturday with the Warriors, according to coach Rivers. They decided against it, instead opting to stage a silent protest by removing their warmup shirts bearing team logos to reveal red T-shirts worn inside out, with the logos hidden. \n \n Silver said he talked to Rivers, Clippers star point guard Chris Paul (who is also the players union president) and other players prior to reaching his decision Tuesday morning. \n \n Dollars talked, too, to ramp up the pressure for Silver to act. \n \n Over a dozen companies -- including State Farm, Virgin America, CarMax and Red Bull -- halted their sponsorships with the Clippers over the remarks, CNN Money reported \n \n Speaking Tuesday, the commissioner said he shares these companies \"outrage,\" adding \"it will take some time\" to get things right. \n \n \"I can understand how upset they are, and I'll do my best to bring them back into the NBA family,\" Silver said. \n \n For some, his decision to ban Sterling was enough. Both Adidas and Samsung announced later Tuesday that they had renewed their \"partnerships\" in the wake of the owner's public punishment. \n \n Warriors coach Mark Jackson, who a day earlier urged fans to boycott Tuesday's game and said there was \"a real discussion among the players\" to do the same so long as Sterling remained in charge, thinks Silver gave everyone enough reason now to come out to a game. \n \n \"I thought he was absolutely incredible ... with the way that he took control of the moment,\" Jackson said of the commissioner before his team's playoff showdown in Los Angeles. \"... It was exactly what the doctor ordered.\" \n \n Magic Johnson: Players are 'very happy and satisfied' \n \n One man thrust into the controversy -- seemingly out of the blue -- was NBA great Magic Johnson. In the TMZ recording, the man seems mad about a photo the woman posted to Instagram with Johnson. \n \n \"In your lousy f**ing Instagrams, you don't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people,\" the man says. \n \n \"If it's white people, it's OK?\" she responds. \"If it was Larry Bird, would it make a difference?\" \n \n Bird was Johnson's chief rival when Bird's Boston Celtics and Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers ruled the NBA. \n \n \"I've known (Magic Johnson) well, and he should be admired. ... I'm just saying that it's too bad you can't admire him privately,\" the man on the recording says. \"Admire him, bring him here, feed him, f**k him, but don't put (Magic) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me. And don't bring him to my games.\" \n \n After the audio went public, Johnson -- who, since retiring from basketball, has become a successful businessman and part owner of baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers -- expressed dismay and insisted he'd never attend a Clippers game so long as Sterling was the owner. \n \n Johnson offered a very different tune Tuesday, commending Silver for exhibiting \"great leadership\" in saying he and others \"are very happy and satisfied.\" \n \n \"I wish I was in LA, I would be at the Clipper game tonight!\" he tweeted.",

He wrote: \"It is essentially the phone book for the internet. If you could prevent access to the phone book then you would effectively render the web useless.\" Read Prof Woodward's full article \n \n \"But we're up - they haven't been able to knock us down. Our engineers are doing an immense job in keeping it up - this sort of attack would take down pretty much anything else.\" \n \n Mr Linford told the BBC that the attack was being investigated by five different national cyber-police-forces around the world. \n \n He claimed he was unable to disclose more details because the forces were concerned that they too may suffer attacks on their own infrastructure. \n \n The attackers have used a tactic known as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), which floods the intended target with large amounts of traffic in an attempt to render it unreachable. \n \n In this case, Spamhaus's Domain Name System (DNS) servers were targeted - the infrastructure that joins domain names, such as bbc.co.uk, the website's numerical internet protocol address. \n \n Mr Linford said the attack's power would be strong enough to take down government internet infrastructure. \n \n \"If you aimed this at Downing Street they would be down instantly,\" he said. \"They would be completely off the internet.\" \n \n He added: \"These attacks are peaking at 300 Gbps (gigabits per second). \n \n \"Normally when there are attacks against major banks, we're talking about 50 Gbps\" \n \n Clogged-up motorway \n \n The knock-on effect is hurting internet services globally, said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey. \n \n \"If you imagine it as a motorway, attacks try and put enough traffic on there to clog up the on and off ramps,\" he told the BBC. \n \n \"With this attack, there's so much traffic it's clogging up the motorway itself.\" \n \n Arbor Networks, a firm which specialises in protecting against DDoS attacks, also said it was the biggest such attack they had seen. \n \n \"The largest DDoS attack that we have witnessed prior to this was in 2010, which was 100 Gbps. Obviously the jump from 100 to 300 is pretty massive,\" said Dan Holden, the company's director of security research. \n \n \"There's certainly possibility for some collateral damage to other services along the way, depending on what that infrastructure looks like.\" \n \n Spamhaus said it was able to cope as it has highly distributed infrastructure in a number of countries. \n \n The group is supported by many of the world's largest internet companies who rely on it to filter unwanted material. \n \n Mr Linford told the BBC that several companies, such as Google, had made their resources available to help \"absorb all of this traffic\". \n \n The attacks typically happened in intermittent bursts of high activity. \n \n \"They are targeting every part of the internet infrastructure that they feel can be brought down,\" Mr Linford said. \n \n \"Spamhaus has more than 80 servers around the world. We've built the biggest DNS server around.\" ||||| When Spamhaus requested aid from CloudFlare, the attackers began to focus their digital ire on the companies that provide data connections for both Spamhaus and CloudFlare. \n \n Questioned about the attacks, Sven Olaf Kamphuis, an Internet activist who said he was a spokesman for the attackers, said in an online message that, \u201cWe are aware that this is one of the largest DDoS attacks the world had publicly seen.\u201d Mr. Kamphuis said Cyberbunker was retaliating against Spamhaus for \u201cabusing their influence.\u201d \n \n \u201cNobody ever deputized Spamhaus to determine what goes and does not go on the Internet,\u201d Mr. Kamphuis said. \u201cThey worked themselves into that position by pretending to fight spam.\u201d \n \n A typical denial-of-service attack tends to affect only a small number of networks. But in the case of a Domain Name System flood attack, data packets are aimed at the victim from servers all over the world. Such attacks cannot easily be stopped, experts say, because those servers cannot be shut off without halting the Internet. \n \n \u201cThe No. 1 rule of the Internet is that it has to work,\u201d said Dan Kaminsky, a security researcher who years ago pointed out the inherent vulnerabilities of the Domain Name System. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop a DNS flood by shutting down those servers because those machines have to be open and public by default. The only way to deal with this problem is to find the people doing it and arrest them.\u201d \n \n The heart of the problem, according to several Internet engineers, is that many large Internet service providers have not set up their networks to make sure that traffic leaving their networks is actually coming from their own users. The potential security flaw has long been known by Internet security specialists, but it has only recently been exploited in a way that threatens the Internet infrastructure. \n \n An engineer at one of the largest Internet communications firms said the attacks in recent days have been as many as five times larger than what was seen recently in attacks against major American banks. He said the attacks were not large enough to saturate the company\u2019s largest routers, but they had overwhelmed important equipment.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If the Internet seems a little slow to you lately, that's because it's in the midst of what is being called the biggest cyberattack of all time, reports the BBC.

Millions of users are experiencing delays while trying to reach websites or while using services like Netflix, and experts fear that if the attacks continue to grow in power, people may not be able to access things like email or online banking. It all started when Spamhaus, which publishes a blacklist that email providers use to weed out spam, put Cyberbunker on its list of spammers. Cyberbunker retaliated, but its attack on Spamhaus ended up having a much larger impact. One architect at a digital content provider likened it to, as the New York Times puts it, using a machine gun in an effort to assassinate one person. The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks \"are essentially like nuclear bombs\" that exploit the Internet's Domain Name System (DNS), says an exec at a group that tried to defend against the attacks and ended up becoming a target. \"It's so easy to cause so much damage.\" And, notes the architect, this is \"the largest publicly announced DDoS attack in the history of the Internet.\" Cyberbunker says Spamhaus is a vigilante group \"abusing [its] influence,\" but the architect notes that Cyberbunker is \"just mad\" that it got caught spamming.

    "document": "Improved technology helped archaeologists finally locate a 16th-century Spanish fort on what is now Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island. \n \n Archaeologists had been looking for San Marcos, one of several forts built on the Santa Elena settlement, for more than 20 years. The location was nailed down using radar and magnetometers. \n \n The machines have been in play for archaeologists for years, but the computer programs interpreting the data have vastly improved in recent years, said University of Georgia archaeologist Victor Thompson. Thompson has worked on the site with University of South Carolina archaeologist Chester DePratter, whose search for San Marcos began in 1993. \n \n The general location of the fort had been noted using documents archived in Spain. There was a drawing of the fort and a written description but nothing detailing the location. \n \n Traditional digging methods had failed to find the fort. \n \n \u201cWe can\u2019t go to a map and say \u2018oh, this is where Pedro Menendez lived or this is where that fort was or this is where anything was,\u2019 \u201d DePratter said. \u201cSo we have to figure it out.\u201d \n \n The fort was founded in 1577 by Pedro Menendez Marquez. The outpost went up in six days, with large pieces already made off-site to protect against an attack by Native Americans. \n \n Though the actual wooden materials have long become part of the earth, the fort could be found by identifying the large post holes required to support the two-story structure and from other signs of human interaction. \n \n \u201cAnytime humans occupy an area for an extended period of time, they alter the physical characteristics of the subsurface,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIf floors become compacted, we can see that. If posts were dug in but then removed, we can see that. \n \n As long as there is some physical change that accompanies those behaviors, then we can image it.\u201d \n \n Santa Elena was founded in 1566 by Pedro Menendez de Aviles. Its whereabouts remained a mystery until 1979, when archaeologists found evidence while digging on the Parris Island golf course. \n \n DePratter and Thompson have been working on the site this summer with a small team of doctoral students and undergraduates. \n \n They are working to map the entire town of Santa Elena, believed to have included some 60 homes as well as a church, shops and taverns. They believe they are also close to knowing the location of Pedro Menendez de Aviles\u2019 home, which can be distinguished from the other home sites by high-end Chinese wares no one else in the settlement could have afforded, DePratter said. \n \n He believes they have also found another governor\u2019s home nearby. \n \n The team is working in open fields that were once fairways of the golf course, since moved to accommodate the archaeological work. \n \n DePratter began his search in 1993 digging small test holes all the way to the golf course clubhouse. He uncovered a pottery kiln \u2014 a chamber where the wares were heated and hardened \u2014 but no fort. \n \n DePratter returned five years later and had play diverted on the golf course to explore again, digging a little too far south of where the fort was eventually found. \n \n Before DePratter and Thompson began mapping again, no digging had been done on the site since 2008 and no large-scale projects since 2000. DePratter reached out to Thompson because of his colleague\u2019s experience with the technology. \n \n Thompson, in a black floppy hat and short-sleeve plaid shirt, unfurled a map Tuesday with a grid of blocks the team has mapped. Each is about 400 square feet. \n \n The work is done in part by pushing a black, three-wheeled cart toting the radar along the ground. A magnetometer and resistivity meter are also used. \n \n In determining the fort\u2019s location, there was no breakthrough moment as when DePratter dinged the pottery kiln. Instead, the work was a compilation of layers of data and ruling out Native American artifacts and sites housing Marine structures during the early 20th century. \n \n The scientists have the cooperation of the Marine Corps and come and go as they please. The remote spot behind the golf course means a protected site with few visitors \u2014 most recently Marines on their lunch break visited Santa Elena to play the popular phone app \u201cPokemon Go.\u201d \n \n Despite the breakthrough on the fort\u2019s location, another six to nine months is required to process the data and learn what has been found. The new discovery will be published this week in the Journal of Archeological Science: Reports, according to a news release. \n \n The resulting information will be included in future exhibits at the Santa Elena History Center, which opened this year in downtown Beaufort to tell the story of the early settlement. \n \n \u201cDays like today are the reason we established the foundation with a vision to uncover this significant history,\u201d Santa Elena Foundation chairman and CEO Andy Beall said in a release. ||||| Archaeologists Chester DePratter (left) and Victor Thompson (right) have mapped the early colonial Fort San Marcos by running ground penetrating radar and using other high tech equipment. \n \n Five centuries ago, two Spanish warships sailed to a marsh bank in the Lowcountry, a coastal jungle haunted by panthers, bison, elk and people the sailors considered savages. The bank was a foothold into the New World also sought by the French. The ships carried wood posts and planking to build a fort. \n \n Today, researchers using radar, electric currents and magnetic waves have pinpointed exactly where they built it. Ground-penetrating radar and magnetometers located the outlines of the lost Fort San Marcos near Beaufort, amid the footprint of a church, courts, shops, taverns and farms that comprised the 1566 settlement of Santa Elena. \n \n Archeologists knew about where it was, but the organic residue remains of the 16th century structures were buried underground in the midst of 16 acres that also are the site of the earlier French settlement of Charlesfort, on the edge of a golf course in today\u2019s Marine Corps Recruit Depot. \n \n Now archaeologists have the key to dig deeper into a past that some call the \u201clost century\u201d of the state\u2019s history, some 104 years before English settlers landed at Charles Towne on the banks of the Ashley River about 50 miles north. In other words, they can now begin to bring that history to life. \n \n \u201cThis work will allow us to tell the story of the land that would eventually become the United States. Santa Elena is an important part of this history that lends insight into how colonial powers in Europe vied for control over this corner of the New World,\u201d said Victor Thompson, University of Georgia anthropologist, who worked with University of South Carolina archaeologist Chester DePratter at the site. \n \n Fort San Marcos founder Pedro Menendez de Aviles \u201cdidn\u2019t leave us with a map of Santa Elena, so remote sensing is allowing us to create a town plan that will be important to interpreting what happened here 450 years ago and for planning future research,\u201d DePratter said. \n \n The breakthrough in June came after a number of failed attempts to locate the site with exploratory digs. The finding is scheduled to be published this week in the Journal of Archeology Science Reports, according to a University of South Carolina news release. \n \n Fort San Marcos was built in 1577. Menendez\u2019 crews got it up in six days because of the threat that a Native American tribe would attack. It allowed the Spanish to restore Santa Elena, which settlers had abandoned the year before when it was attacked. \n \n The fort was a large bunkhouse of barracks and storerooms with cannon platform on one end, according to the release. It had 11 mounted cannons, the largest weighing more than 5,400 pounds. \n \n After five years, the wooden posts surrounding the fort rotted, and a new fort, also called San Marcos was built on the nearby shoreline. \n \n The restored Santa Elena grew to nearly 400 residents, impressive enough to be named the capital of Spanish Florida in 1571. \n \n But after English privateer Sir Francis Drake began attacking Spanish settlements, the settlement was abandoned in 1587 for Fort Augustine in today\u2019s Florida. \n \n Among other remains image-mapped at the site are what the archaeologists described as a vast array of possible wells, houses, posts and ditches. \n \n \u201cSanta Elena is providing once again an unprecedented view of the 16th-century landscape. This is one of the best sites for remote sensing that I\u2019ve ever had the privilege to work on,\u201d Thompson said. \n \n Reach Bo Petersen at 843-937-5744, @bopete on twitter or Bo Petersen Reporting on Facebook. ||||| In this undated image provided by Amanda Thompson with the University of Georgia shows archeologists Chester DePratter, left, with the University of South Carolina and Victor Thompson, right, of the University...

(AP) \u2014 Archaeologists have found the location of a long-sought Spanish fort on the South Carolina coast at the site of what was once the first capital of Spanish Florida. \n \n A release from the University of South Carolina says the site of San Marcos, one of five forts built during the 21-year history of the early settlement of Santa Elena, has finally been located on Parris Island near Hilton Head Island. \n \n University of South Carolina archaeologist Chester DePratter and Victor Thompson of the Center for Archaeological Sciences at the University of Georgia, have conducted research for the past two years to find the site of the 1577 fort. \n \n Using ground-penetrating radar and other high-tech equipment last month, they found the site and are publishing the details of their work this week in The Journal of Archaeology Science Reports. \n \n Santa Elena, founded in 1566 to protect Spanish shipping interests, was the first capital of Spanish colonial Florida. The site of the settlement itself was located back in 1979 beneath a golf course at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot on Parris Island. \n \n But the site of San Marcos remained a mystery. \n \n Using the high-tech equipment, scientists were able to measure differences in local magnetic fields to locate the fort. They were also able to map where buildings stood on the 15-acre Santa Elena settlement. Those buildings included a church, courts, shops, taverns and farms. \n \n There are no historical documents with a map of Santa Elena, DePratter said. \n \n \"Remote sensing is allowing us to create a town plan that will be important to interpreting what happened here 450 years ago and for planning future research,\" he said. \n \n \"Santa Elena is providing once again an unprecedented view of the 16th-century landscape,\" Thompson added. \n \n Parris island is located between Hilton Head and Beaufort on the lower South Carolina coast. \n \n Back in April, events were held in the Beaufort area to mark the 450th anniversary of the founding of Santa Elena. They included the opening of the Santa Elena History Center and a visit to the area by a replica of a Spanish galleon.",

    "document": "Article Excerpt \n \n The Obama administration said Tuesday it would delay enforcing a provision of the new health-care law that requires large employers to provide coverage for workers or pay a penalty in 2014, the biggest revision so far to the federal health-care overhaul. \n \n The law, passed in 2010, requires companies with the equivalent of 50 or more full-time workers to offer health benefits starting on Jan. 1\u2014or pay a penalty of at least $2,000 per employee. The delay, announced by the Treasury Department in a blog post Tuesday, means that penalty won't kick in until 2015. \n \n The decision reflects pressure from companies ... ||||| The ObamaCare employer mandate requiring businesses to provide their workers with health insurance will be delayed by a year, the administration said Tuesday in a stunning announcement. [WATCH VIDEO] \n \n Delaying the requirement until 2015 is an enormous victory for businesses that had lobbied against the healthcare law. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n It also means one of healthcare reform\u2019s central requirements will be implemented after the 2014 midterm elections, when the GOP is likely to use the Affordable Care Act as a vehicle to attack vulnerable Democrats. \n \n White House officials cast the delay as a decision necessary to give employers more time to comply with the rules, while Republicans said it showed President Obama's signature legislative achievement was fatally flawed. \n \n Former Obama adviser David Axelrod on Wednesday insisted history would look kindly on the law. \n \n President Obama\u2019s \u201cview is that we ought to plow forward, make sure this can work, and we're going to look back at it, and it's going to be our proudest accomplishment,\" Axelrod said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\" \n \n In a White House blog post, senior adviser Valerie Jarrett wrote Tuesday that the delay would give employers more time to adjust to the system. \n \n \u201cThis allows employers the time to test the new reporting systems and make any necessary adaptations to their health benefits while staying the course toward making health coverage more affordable and accessible for their workers,\u201d Jarrett wrote. \n \n Jarrett also wrote that the delay would help in \u201ccutting red tape and simplifying the reporting process.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe have heard the concern that the reporting called for under the law about each worker\u2019s access to and enrollment in health insurance requires new data collection systems and coordination,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cSo we plan to re-vamp and simplify the reporting process.\u201d \n \n The Treasury Department\u2019s announcement does not affect the individual mandate, which requires most taxpayers to either purchase insurance or pay a penalty, and administration officials said on Tuesday that other aspects of the law wouldn\u2019t be delayed. \n \n The law\u2019s critics have framed that as a double standard, accusing the administration of acknowledging the law\u2019s complexity for businesses without offering a similar break to the individual workers who still have to buy insurance. The employer mandate affected businesses with more than 50 workers. \n \n \u201cThat the Obama administration is putting off this job-killing requirement on employers, but not individuals and families, shows how deeply flawed the president\u2019s signature domestic policy achievement is,\u201d said Sen. Orrin Hatch (Utah), the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. \n \n \u201cWhile a delay of this mandate is welcome news since it shows the challenges the employers are facing complying with it, a delay \u2014 conveniently past the 2014 election \u2014 only adds to the uncertainty these job creators face because of ObamaCare,\u201d Hatch said. \n \n Other Republicans seized on the news, arguing that the delays suggested the law was a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d and that Democratic candidates in 2014 would have difficulty explaining the delay. \n \n Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) renewed their calls for repealing the law in full. \n \n \u201cThis further confirms that even the proponents of ObamaCare know it will hurt jobs, decrease economic growth and make it harder for families to have access to quality and affordable health care,\u201d Cantor said in statement. \n \n \u201cRather than continuing to delay the predictable pain until another Election Day has passed, we should scrap this entire law and instead implement patient-centered reforms before any more damage is done,\u201d he said. \n \n While GOP leaders were quick to react, hammering the delay as evidence that the law is unworkable, Democratic leaders were quieter Tuesday evening. One exception was Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.), who tweeted that the decision shows Obama is \u201cin it for long haul to fully implement\u201d the healthcare law. \n \n Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said the administration was showing \"a willingness to be flexible.\u201d \n \n \"It is better to do this right than fast,\u201d said Jentleson in a statement. \n \n Some Democrats had openly fretted about the law\u2019s implementation. \n \n Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), one of the primary architects of the healthcare law, warned in April that small businesses were struggling to come to grips with their new responsibilities. \n \n \u201cSmall businesses have no idea what to do, what to expect,\u201d Baucus told Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at a hearing. \n \n \u201cI just see a huge train wreck coming down,\u201d Baucus said. \n \n The Chamber of Commerce praised the delay. \n \n \u201cThe administration has finally recognized the obvious: Employers need more time and clarification of the rules of the road before implementing the employer mandate,\u201d said Randy Johnson, the Chamber\u2019s senior vice president for labor, immigration and employee benefits. \n \n \u201cThe Chamber has testified numerous times about the problems with the mandate, and we applaud the administration\u2019s step to delay this provision. We will continue to work to alleviate this and other problems with ObamaCare.\u201d \n \n Many employers had threatened to cut employees\u2019 hours to avoid the new requirements. \n \n Employers had also complained about the mandate\u2019s reporting provision. Rules on the requirement came out this year, leaving little time for businesses to respond and prepare. \n \n \u201cI hope that this means that employers who have been cutting employees to part-time will now call them back to full-time employment, but regret that the administration is delaying the implementation of an important provision of the ACA,\u201d said Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University and a strong supporter of the healthcare law. \n \n The change will likely mean that more people buy individual coverage through the law\u2019s new insurance exchanges, which are expected to be open for enrollment by Oct. 1. \n \n If fewer employees have access to coverage through work, at least some are likely to turn to the exchanges for coverage and the tax credit that helps cover the cost. \n \n Hatch said he hoped that was not the administration\u2019s goal, stating it could be a \u201cbackdoor attempt at getting more Americans into the exchanges, which have been plagued by problems.\u201d \n \n More people on the exchanges would also mean greater federal spending on the tax subsidies, increasing the law\u2019s total cost. \n \n Sabrina Corlette, a health policy expert at Georgetown University, said the move could be a boon to consumers because plans on the exchanges will be stronger than those offered by many employers. \n \n She worried, however, that the employer mandate could be deferred again down the line. \n \n \u201cAnyone that\u2019s been around politics long enough knows to be a little bit concerned,\u201d Corlette said. \u201cIf a one-year delay is OK, how about a two-year delay? How about a three-year delay?\u201d \n \n The political effects of the delay could be more severe than the effect on the law\u2019s expansion of healthcare coverage. One vulnerable Democrat, Sen. Mark Begich (Alaska), hailed the decision. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m pleased the administration is listening to me and the many businesses that are concerned about the complexity of the new requirements,\u201d said Begich, who is facing reelection in 2014. \n \n In its most recent estimates before the delay was announced, the Congressional Budget Office said the number of people with employer-based coverage was not expected to change next year. \n \n The penalty for employers that failed to offer coverage was also not expected to bring in any money next year, according to the CBO\u2019s latest estimates. \n \n The delay gives employers a free year to dump their workers into the law\u2019s insurance exchanges, former Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin said. \n \n \u201cEssentially for calendar 2014, the act of dropping coverage and dumping employees into the exchanges is on sale,\u201d he said. \u201cDrop and dump, but no penalty.\u201d \n \n \u2014This story was posted at 5:37 on July 2 and was last updated at 10:08 a.m. on July 3. ||||| WASHINGTON \u2014 In a significant setback for President Obama\u2019s signature domestic initiative, the administration on Tuesday abruptly announced a one-year delay, until 2015, in his health care law\u2019s mandate that larger employers provide coverage for their workers or pay penalties. The decision postpones the effective date beyond next year\u2019s midterm elections. \n \n Employer groups welcomed the news of the concession, which followed complaints from businesses and was posted late in the day on the White House and Treasury Web sites while the president was flying home from Africa. Republicans\u2019 gleeful reactions made clear that they would not cease to make repeal of Obamacare a campaign issue for the third straight election cycle. \n \n While the postponement technically does not affect other central provisions of the law \u2014 in particular those establishing health insurance marketplaces in the states, known as exchanges, where uninsured Americans can shop for policies \u2014 it threatens to throw into disarray the administration\u2019s effort to put those provisions into effect by Jan. 1. \n \n \u201cI am utterly astounded,\u201d said Sara Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George Washington University and an advocate of the law. \u201cIt boggles the mind. This step could significantly reduce the number of uninsured people who will gain coverage in 2014.\u201d \n \n At the White House, Tara McGuinness, a senior adviser on the law, disputed that. \n \n \u201cNothing in the new guidance regarding employer reporting and responsibility will limit individuals\u2019 eligibility for premium tax credits to buy insurance through the marketplaces that open on Oct. 1,\u201d she said. \n \n Under the law, most Americans will be required to have insurance in January 2014, or they will be subject to tax penalties. The announcement on Tuesday did not say anything about delaying that requirement or those penalties. \n \n Administration officials sought to put the action in a positive light in the online announcements, and they emphasized that the existing insurance coverage of most Americans would not be affected. \n \n \u201cWe have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively,\u201d Mark J. Mazur, an assistant Treasury secretary, wrote on the department\u2019s Web site. \u201cWe recognize that the vast majority of businesses that will need to do this reporting already provide health insurance to their workers, and we want to make sure it is easy for others to do so.\u201d \n \n The 2010 Affordable Care Act required employers with more than 50 full-time workers to offer them affordable health insurance starting next year or face fines. Some companies with payrolls just above that threshold said they would cut jobs or switch some full-time workers to part-time employment so that they could avoid providing coverage. \n \n Under the provision to set up state-based marketplaces, subsidies are supposed to be available to many lower- and middle-income people who do not have access to coverage from employers or other sources. It may be difficult, however, for officials running the exchanges to know who is entitled to subsidies if employers do not report information on the coverage they provide to workers. \n \n Enrollment in the exchanges is to begin Oct. 1, with insurance coverage taking effect on Jan. 1. \u201cWe are on target to open the health insurance marketplace on Oct. 1 where small businesses and ordinary Americans will be able to go to one place to learn about their coverage options and make side-by-side comparisons of each plan\u2019s price and benefits before they make their decision,\u201d Valerie Jarrett, Mr. Obama\u2019s senior adviser and liaison to the business community, wrote on the White House Web site. \n \n But even some supporters of the law dispute that the establishment of the health insurance exchanges is on schedule, especially since progress varies by state and some Republican-led states are resisting the health care law and withholding resources for putting it into effect. \n \n Much of the administration\u2019s public effort, especially at the Department of Health and Human Services, has been directed toward spreading the word to uninsured Americans, especially younger and healthy individuals whose participation is needed to help keep down premiums for everyone else. About 85 percent of Americans are insured, so most individuals will be unaffected, at least initially. \n \n Behind the scenes, however, the administration has been fielding questions and criticisms from businesses about the reporting requirements \u2014 especially the Treasury Department, which has responsibility, given its oversight of the tax reporting system. \n \n Employer groups were quick to applaud the delay. At the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has strongly opposed the law, Randy Johnson, senior vice president for labor, immigration and employee benefits, said in a statement, \u201cThe administration has finally recognized the obvious \u2014 employers need more time and clarification of the rules of the road before implementing the employer mandate.\u201d \n \n E. Neil Trautwein, a vice president of the National Retail Federation, said the delay \u201cwill provide employers and businesses more time to update their health care coverage without threat of arbitrary punishment.\u201d \n \n Mr. Mazur, the Treasury official, said the delay \u201cwill allow us to consider ways to simplify the new reporting requirements consistent with the law.\u201d \n \n \u201cSecond,\u201d he added, \u201cit will provide time to adapt health coverage and reporting systems while employers are moving toward making health coverage affordable and accessible for their employees.\u201d \n \n Within the next week, Mr. Mazur said, Treasury will issue official guidance to insurers, self-insuring employers and other parties that provide health coverage. Formal rules will be proposed this summer, he added, but the administration will encourage employers to comply with the law\u2019s reporting provisions in 2014, as originally mandated. \n \n Democrats were all but silent on the news, but a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, released a statement late Tuesday. \u201cBoth the administration and Senate Democrats have shown \u2014 and continue to show \u2014 a willingness to be flexible and work with all interested parties to make sure that implementation of the Affordable Care Act is as beneficial as possible to all involved,\u201d the spokesman, Adam Jentleson, said. \u201cIt is better to do this right than fast.\u201d \n \n But Republicans immediately reacted with statements claiming vindication for their efforts to repeal the law altogether. \n \n Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, called the administration action \u201ca cynical political ploy to delay the coming train wreck associated with Obamacare until after the 2014 elections.\u201d \n \n And Senator Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, who faces re-election next year in Kentucky, said in a statement, \u201cThe fact remains that Obamacare needs to be repealed and replaced with common-sense reforms that actually lower costs for Americans.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 ObamaCare is still going into effect in 2014, but one key component of it is being temporarily shelved.

The Hill calls the decision \"stunning\" and says it \"represents an enormous victory for businesses that had lobbied against the healthcare law.\" It also notes that the move pushes back the start of the controversial provision until after the 2014 midterms, which should be good news for vulnerable Democrats. The New York Times reports that other key parts of ObamaCare, including the establishment of \"exchanges\" where people can buy insurance, will take effect as planned in 2014.

While Diavik and the neighboring Ekati mine produce some very high quality diamonds, they\u2019re not renowned for the sort of huge gems normally found in southern African mines. \n \n Dominion Chief Executive Officer Shane Durgin said the diamond is gem quality, meaning it\u2019s suitable for jewelry, but gave few additional details that help determine its value. Yellow stones typically sell at a discount to Type IIa top whites often found in the best African mines. Still, the highest quality fancy vivid yellow or fancy intense yellow stones can sell for a premium. \n \n \u201cWe can label it fancy yellow, but beyond that, due to its rough nature and the abrasions received through the processing facility, that\u2019s all we can comment on,\u201d Durgin said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to give a ballpark estimate. It all depends on, again, the cutting and the resulting stone it ends up.\u201d \n \n The discovery is the seventh-biggest this century, according to Bloomberg calculations, and would be among the 30 largest stones ever unearthed. The biggest was the 3,106-carat Cullinan, found near Pretoria in South Africa in 1905. It was cut into several polished gems, the two largest of which -- the Great Star of Africa and the Lesser Star of Africa -- are set in the Crown Jewels of Britain. \n \n The 21st Century's Biggest Diamonds Source: Company filings/Bloomberg \n \n There have been a slew of big finds in recent years as better technology helped miners first detect, and then not break big stones that are susceptible to being smashed in the mining process. Among those are diamonds found by Lucara Diamond Corp. and Gem Diamonds Ltd. that fetched between $40 million and $63 million. \n \n While the Diavik mine is 60 percent owned and fully operated by Rio, Dominion bought the stone in an internal auction process from its partner. Dominion said it will select someone soon to cut and polish the stone. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful gem-quality diamond,\u201d Durgin said, adding that it was somewhat of a \u201cmiracle\u201d that the stone survived the mining process. \u201cIt\u2019s very unusual for a diamond of this size in this part of the world. So it\u2019s a very unique discovery.\u201d \n \n The discovery is the seventh-biggest this century Source: Dominion Diamond Mines \n \n In 2015, Rio unearthed a 187.7 carat gem-quality diamond from Diavik. \u2018Foxfire\u2019 narrowly escaped being pulverized because its elongated shape allowed it to slip sideways through a filtering screen. The diamond was exhibited at the Smithsonian before being turned into a pair of pale yellow earrings weighing a total of 77.7 carats. The earrings sold for over $1.5 million at Christie\u2019s earlier this month. \n \n This year\u2019s find comes at a good time for Dominion. Since billionaire Dennis Washington bought the company for $1.2 billion last year, there\u2019s been a management merry-go-round with at least five senior personnel leaving. That includes CEO Patrick Evans, who left last week after just over a year at the helm. Dominion needs to decide if it will pull the trigger on expansion projects that would extend the life of the Ekati mine. \n \n Diamond mining in this area of Canada\u2019s sub-arctic is incredibly difficult. There are no permanent roads, meaning the only access is by air or, for a few months a year, ice roads that have to be rebuilt each winter. \n \n Meanwhile, the global market has been under pressure, especially for smaller and lower quality stones. There\u2019s currently an oversupply of such diamonds, and a weaker Indian rupee has put pressure on manufacturers in the country where about 90 percent of gems are cut and polished. Major cutting centers have also been squeezed by low margins and a drop in trade finance. \n \n \u2014 With assistance by Joseph Richter ||||| The 552 carat yellow diamond beats a previous record held by a diamond from the same mine \n \n Dominion Diamond Mines ULC (\u201cDominion\u201d), a world leading producer of responsibly mined diamonds, announces the recovery of the largest known gem quality diamond ever found in North America. The 552 carat yellow Canadamark\u2122 diamond was unearthed in October at the Diavik Diamond Mine (\u201cDiavik\u201d), approximately 135 miles south of the Arctic Circle in Canada\u2019s Northwest Territories. The find far surpasses the previous record held by the Diavik Foxfire at 187.7 carats, which was also recovered at the same mine in 2015. Dominion owns 40% of Diavik. \n \n \u201cThis incredible discovery showcases what is truly spectacular about Canadamark diamonds,\u201d states Kyle Washington, Chairman of Dominion Diamond Mines. \u201cThe color and texture of the diamond are a unique example of the journey that natural diamonds take from their formation until we unearth them. Our Diavik Mine has produced some of the most beautiful diamonds in the world, and this one certainly tops the list.\u201d \n \n The astonishing gemstone was uncovered while passing through the initial screening process at Diavik\u2019s recovery plant. Abrasion markings on the stone\u2019s surface attest to the difficult journey it underwent during recovery, and the fact that it remains intact is remarkable. Measuring 33.74mm x 54.56mm and weighing exactly 552.74 carats, a diamond of this size is completely unexpected for this part of the world and marks a true milestone for diamond mining in North America and Canadamark diamonds overall. \n \n Its color, texture and structure are also unique from a geological perspective and may be studied further. The diamond will not be sold in its rough form. Due to the significance of the discovery, Dominion will select a partner in the coming weeks who will cut and polish the stone. The size and highly technical nature of this stone means that only a handful of master cutters in the world are qualified to polish it, ensuring that the stone\u2019s beauty, color and brilliance are maximized. Dominion expects to achieve a significant main stone once the diamond is polished, that will be Canadamark certified. As the diamond is still undergoing evaluation, it is too early to determine the ultimate value of the diamond. However, when polished, the Diavik Foxfire yielded a 37.87 brilliant-cut pear shape and a 36.80 brilliant-cut pear shape that were both recently auctioned as part of Christies Magnificent Jewels and were purchased for $1.3 million. \n \n About Dominion Diamond Mines ULC \n \n Dominion Diamond Mines ULC is a Canadian mining company and one of the world\u2019s largest producers and suppliers of premium rough diamond assortments to the global market. The company owns a controlling interest in the Ekati Diamond Mine, which it operates, and owns 40% of the Diavik Diamond Mine. Both mines are located in the Northwest Territories of Canada, which has some of the most stringent environmental standards for diamond miners in the world. In addition to its mining operations, Dominion has offices in Canada, Belgium and India. \n \n About Canadamark \n \n Canadamark\u2122 diamonds are mindfully sourced to celebrate life\u2019s important milestones. Canadamark\u2122 certified diamonds carry a hallmark that gives consumers confidence in the diamond\u2019s Canadian origin and history. All Canadamark\u2122 diamonds are responsibly mined, natural and untreated, and tracked through an independent, audited process at every stage of the diamond\u2019s journey, from the mine of origin to the polished stone. The Canadamark\u2122 brand is owned by Dominion Diamond Mines ULC.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Gigantic gemstones don't typically emerge out of Canadian mines like they do in South Africa, but a big find in the Northwest Territories has just smashed that stereotype. Bloomberg reports a 552-carat yellow diamond the size of a chicken egg (picture here) was found there in October, and it's now said to be the largest diamond ever unearthed in North America. The \"astonishing gemstone\" was discovered at the Diavik mine, owned by the Rio Tinto Group and Dominion Diamond Mines, about 135 miles south of the Arctic Circle, per a press release. In addition to its North American honors, the diamond, which measures 33.74mm by 54.56mm, would rank among the 30 biggest stones ever discovered, per Bloomberg estimates, as well as the seventh largest this century. The scratches on the diamond indicate it had a \"difficult journey,\" and that it remained intact during the recovery process is \"remarkable,\" the release notes. Also noteworthy is the fact that it came out of a mine in Canada, which is known for having tough terrain to penetrate due to the sub-Arctic conditions and dearth of access. \"It's very unusual for a diamond of this size in this part of the world,\" Dominion Chief Executive Officer Shane Durgin tells Bloomberg. He adds that it's hard to say yet how much the diamond will ultimately be worth; it needs to be seen how it ends up once it's cut. Dominion will select a partner to do that job, and polish the stone to finish it off, in the next few weeks. (A 163-carat white diamond went for $33.7M last year at auction.)",

The 552-carat yellow gem was found at the Diavik mine in the Northwest Territories, and is almost three times the size of the next largest stone everfound in Canada. While Diavik and the neighboring Ekati mine produce some very high quality diamonds, they\u2019re not renowned for the sort of huge gems normally found in southern African mines. \u201cWe can label it fancy yellow, but beyond that, due to its rough nature and the abrasions received through the processing facility, that\u2019s all we can comment on,\u201d Dominion Chief Executive Officer Shane Durgin said in an interview. Yellow stones typically sell at a discount to Type IIa top whites often found in the best African mines, but the highest quality fancy vivid yellow or fancy intense yellow stones can sell for a premium.",

Tuesday ... still flashing the 7 carat, $300k wedding ring upgrade Stephen got for her back in 2014. \n \n According to the divorce docs she filed Monday, the couple's been separated since December ... so the breakup is hardly fresh. \n \n Maybe this is a sign: Stephen goes, but the ring stays. ||||| Mel B Belafonte Beat Me Physically And Beat Me Down Emotionally \n \n Mel B Says Husband Stephen Belafonte Beat Me Physically and Beat Me Down Emotionally \n \n EXCLUSIVE \n \n Mel B says she was emotionally weak when she married Stephen Belafonte, but it soon became apparent ... whenever she achieved success, he would literally beat her down to maintain control. \n \n Mel B got a restraining order Monday, forcing Belafonte to leave the family home and stay clear of her and her 3 kids. In her declaration, she recounts why she married him. She says, \"At the time, I was vulnerable. I was giving birth as a single mother, my self-esteem was very low, and my hormones were out of balance due to the pregnancy.\" \n \n She says Belafonte \"rushed in to help me in every way,\" saying in the beginning he was nice and supportive. \n \n Shortly after they got married, Mel B says things changed dramatically. She says he would tell her she was \"worthless, that he made me 'who I am,' that no one knows how really stupid I am.\" \n \n She says he destroyed her self-confidence and self-esteem, especially because she was struggling to lose her pregnancy weight. \n \n Mel B says she lived in abject fear he would make good on his threat to release sex tapes of them he recorded, threatening to ruin her career. She also says he threatened to release the videos to Children's Services in an attempt to have the kids taken away. \n \n As we reported, she says it got so bad, in December 2014, she tried committing suicide by swallowing an entire bottle of Aspirin. \n \n She says the final humiliation was when he allegedly began having sex with their nanny, got her pregnant and told her they should all just live together. She says she got up the gumption to fire the nanny and leave him, but he fired back that the nanny would leak damaging stories to the media and Children's Services. She was so scared she re-hired the nanny and stayed with him. \n \n Even after separating from him in December, she began posting messages suggesting she and Belafonte were working things out. She says what finally gave her the push was her father dying last month. She says Belafonte said, \"Suck it up. If he's going to die, he's going to die,\" and that was the final straw. \n \n Belafonte tells TMZ he questions the motives of her accusations. ||||| Mel B Abuse by Husband Seen By Many, Authorities Not Called \n \n Mel B Says Abuse by Husband Stephen Belafonte Seen By Many, Authorities Not Called \n \n EXCLUSIVE \n \n Mel B says she has been the victim of horrific brutality at the hands of husband Stephen Belafonte for nearly a decade, and lots of people around her saw her injuries but it appears most of them bought her stories that made no sense. \n \n TMZ broke the story, Mel B got a restraining order Monday against Belafonte, claiming he beat her, choked her and threw her to the ground on multiple occasions. According to the documents, after an alleged beating in 2012 over Belafonte's jealousy of Usher, producers of 'X Factor' (Australia) noticed swelling on her face and asked for a physician. She claimed it was an allergic reaction to shellfish and according to the document, the doctor on set bought her story. \n \n She was also forced to miss a filming of 'X Factor' (UK) in late 2014 because her injuries were so bad they could not be covered by theatrical makeup. When she finally returned, she still had visible facial and body wounds yet no one sounded the alarm. \n \n Around the same time, things got so bad, Mel B tried to take her own life by swallowing an entire bottle of Aspirin. She had a change of heart, tried calling 999, but she says Belafonte prevented her from doing so. At some point she says her friend, Randy, came over but Belafonte forced him to leave. Randy called an ambulance but Belafonte turned it away. Authorities were not alerted. \n \n The next day, her driver showed up to take her to work and saw such extensive injuries he took her to the hospital, where she spent 2 days with security standing guard outside her room to keep Belafonte away. Yet authorities again were not alerted. \n \n She returned again to 'X Factor' (UK) with visible facial and body wounds, which producers attempted to cover up. Again, authorities not called. \n \n When she was back in L.A. she told 'X Factor' \"employers\" she had attempted suicide to escape from the abuse at the hands of Belafonte. She says they offered assistance to get her away from Belafonte, but it appears authorities were not contacted and she went back to living with him. \n \n Mel B says throughout the years, Belafonte would harass and intimidate her agents, producers and co-stars, and they complained to her he was \"abusive and demanding,\" and he was adversely affecting her business ... but again, it appears authorities were not contacted. \n \n Belafonte tells TMZ he questions the motives of her accusations. ||||| Mel B Claims Husband Beat, Sexually Exploited Her \n \n Mel B Claims Husband Stephen Belafonte Beat, Sexually Exploited Her \n \n EXCLUSIVE \n \n Mel B claims estranged husband Stephen Belafonte was a monster, brutally beating her, extorting her into doing 3-ways with other women and threatening to release sex tapes ... and now she says she and her children fear for their lives. \n \n Mel B's lawyers got a restraining order Monday, forcing Belafonte to stay away from Mel and her 3 kids and ordering him to leave the family home. \n \n In her declaration, Mel B tells a horrific story of abuse. Here are some of her allegations: \n \n -- November 2007, the night of her \"Dancing with the Stars\" finale, as she was getting ready at home, she says Stephen placed both of his hands around her neck, began choking her and slammed her down onto the hardwood floors. She says this was the pattern ... when she achieved any measure of success, he would \"beat me down to let me know he was in charge.\" \n \n -- July 2012, while she was taping 'X Factor,' she was going to tape a segment with Usher, and Belafonte flew into a jealous rage, punched her with a closed fist in the face, splitting her lip. When she asked how she was supposed to work with the injury, he said she should have thought of that before deciding to \"flirt with and f*** Usher.\" \n \n -- August 2012, the day after performing at the closing ceremonies for the London Olympics, he punched her with a closed fist and pushed her down on the carpet. Her skin was burned from being pushed against the carpet and her face \"actually scabbed over the rug burns.\" He then forced her to tweet out she injured herself by running on 7\" Christian Louboutin heels. \n \n -- Mel B claims Stephen got their nanny pregnant. She says he told her he wanted to have the baby and \"all three of us live together.\" She says Stephen ultimately demanded the nanny get an abortion. She also says Stephen paid the nanny in excess of $300,000 of Mel B's money \"for alleged nanny services.\" \n \n -- She also says in 2014, she was overcome with \"emotional and physical exhaustion\" and took an entire bottle of Aspirin. She tried calling 999 and he blocked her, throwing her in the bedroom, locking the door and \"telling me to 'die, bitch!'\" \n \n -- She says Stephen has sex tapes of her and repeatedly threatened to release them to ruin her career. \n \n -- And, she says, he forced her to \"participate in sexual intercourse with him and random women\" and he would often secretly record the encounters. She says when she tried to resist the 3-ways, he'd threaten to release the sex tapes. \n \n -- Mel B says she tried to leave him many times, but he \"threatened me with violence and threatened to destroy my life in every possible way ... destroy my career and take my kids from me.\" \n \n -- Mel B says Stephen has a gun at home ... a violation of law since he's prohibited from carrying firearms as part of a domestic violence conviction involving another woman. She says the gun is either a .38 or .357 magnum. \n \n TMZ broke the story ... agents from the Dept. of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms served a search warrant on Belafonte Friday night after his brother made claims Stephen had the gun. Mel claims Stephen kept the gun in a lockbox in the bedroom closet. She says ATF agents did not find the gun. \n \n In addition to getting the restraining order, the judge ordered Stephen to leave the family home in the Hollywood Hills. He went to the house late Monday afternoon, packed up some of his stuff, and told our photog the allegations were untrue.",

    "document": "The play, ironically, started with defense, a hand extended into the passing lane. It was midway through the second half of that Final Four game between Houston and Louisville. Benny Anders, a shoot-first-pass-maybe swingman for Houston, reached in and stole the ball near the free throw line. \n \n This is an article from the issue \n \n The play that followed took place 30 years ago this month, but it's etched in my memory. Anders slalomed through traffic and headed upcourt, his spectacular Jheri curl trailing him like tails on a kite. He passed half-court, picking up speed. A defender from Louisville (I had to spark up YouTube to I.D. Charles Jones) tried to cut off his angle to the basket. No matter. Anders elevated for what looked to be a conventional layup. \n \n Except that Anders always seemed to have a deep-seated grudge against convention. He splayed his thick legs, sausaged into a comically tight pair of shorts, cocked his arm and threw down a vicious dunk, nearly beheading Jones. \n \n Though Michael Jordan was a sophomore on the North Carolina team that had won the previous NCAA championship, Houston was the It Program that season, a traveling road show whose aerial performance art took on mythical dimensions. The Cougars, led by future top 50 alltime NBAers Clyde Drexler and Akeem (the H came later) Olajuwon, had been nicknamed Phi Slamma Jamma, a nod to the quantity and quality of their dunks. But none was as extravagant as this particular throwdown by Anders. \n \n One reason was aesthetic. But another was the blithe disregard that Anders, a sophomore reserve, had betrayed: for the defender occluding his path and fouling him, in turn making the dunk all the more remarkable; for the rules of physics and geometry that should have served as discouragement; for the fact that his team was trailing in this, the most important game of the season and of Anders's career. And I wasn't the only one struck by that Anders dunk against Louisville. In his 2009 book, Eating the Dinosaur, Chuck Klosterman recalled the moment perfectly as \"a midair shark attack.\" \n \n Galvanized by the play, Houston eventually pulled away, but Anders wasn't done yet. His team ahead by eight points in the final 30 seconds, Anders was at half-court with no defender in his path and a teammate ahead of him. Anders declined to pass or dribble out the clock. Instead he achieved cruising altitude, cuffed the ball with his right hand and threw down a nasty reverse dunk. \n \n The move may have been imprudent\u2014\"the most selfish play I've seen in all my years of basketball,\" his teammate Reid Gettys would later tell ESPN\u2014but it was the essence of Anders. Here was a player who summed up his game as \"Take it to the rack and stick it on them.\" Which was not even his best line that season. For years his admonishment to Olajuwon\u2014\"When I drop a dime to the big Swahili, he got to put it in the hole\"\u2014endured as the gold standard for sports quotes. \n \n But that's all that endured. Despite his athleticism and flair, Anders never made as big an impact again. He floundered at Houston and failed to ascend to the NBA. Then he disappeared. Not metaphorically disappeared, as in, fell out of the public eye and now leads a life of pleasant seclusion. He literally disappeared, as in, whereabouts unknown. Vanished. Evaporated. Gone. A Jheri-curled Yeti. \n \n \"Where in the world is Benny Anders?\" became a parlor game in the hoops ecosystem. Mention Anders's name to Drexler, and he whistles, smiles and says, \"Benny Anders is a mystery. Probably the '90s is the last time anyone heard from him.\" The University of Houston's sports information department claims it's been at least that long. As Michael Young, another Phi Slamma Jamma alumnus, told the Houston Chronicle in 2011, \"Nobody knows where Benny Anders is. We've been trying to find him for years.\" Other former teammates joke about his having entered the witness protection program. \n \n A decade ago Grant Wahl, covering college basketball for SI, was asked about what ever happened to Anders by a reader. Grant called the only Anders listed in the directory of Bernice, La., Benny's hometown. He reached Anders's grandmother, who could only lament, \"If you find him, tell him I'd love to hear from him.\" How could an athlete with such staggering presence leave behind such a staggering absence? \n \n And thus began a ... well, what? I wouldn't dramatize it as an obsession or white whale or even personal quest, but maybe as something closer to an abiding interest in finding Benny Anders. He had to be out there somewhere, right? \n \n Anders was the kind of figure I gravitated toward as a journalist, the embodiment of all those c words: charismatic, colorful, combustible, candid. But in 1983, as a kid in elementary school, I thought of him as the avatar of another c word: cool. He had subversive appeal, a funkadelic soulfulness. If Olajuwon and Drexler were the polished performers who played the big stage, Anders was the alterna-band rocker, all authenticity. He was a cowboy baller, with a personality to match. And I didn't even know the half of it. \n \n In high school, known as Bennie Anders, he was a star in tiny Bernice and played on the same AAU team as Joe Dumars, Karl Malone and John (Hot Rod) Williams. \"Benny always had a big personality,\" says Dumars. \"He was the most spirited guy on our teams.\" While the other three players were content to go to smaller, in-state colleges\u2014McNeese State, Louisiana Tech and Tulane, respectively\u2014Anders was hell-bent on playing for a big-time program. On his recruiting visit to LSU, however, he showed up wearing a shirt that read THE OUTLAW, his high school nickname. When LSU's coach, Dale Brown, asked about the phrase, Anders embellished. \"I'd go from town to town, causing disturbances.\" LSU passed. \n \n Two days after Anders helped Houston defeat Louisville, he was on the floor in the waning seconds of the championship game against North Carolina State. Anders gambled for a steal at half-court. Of course he did. He missed, freeing Wolfpack guard Dereck Whittenburg to throw up a long jump shot, which ended in the hands of teammate Lorenzo Charles, who dunked the ball at the buzzer, consummating one of the great upsets in college hoops history. Jim Valvano's scramble to find someone to hug? It doesn't happen without Anders's unbridled nature. \n \n The next season Anders, and his comparably eccentric teammate forward Braxton Clark, quit the team after clashing with the coach, Guy Lewis, over their banishment to the bench. \"Heavy pine time,\" Anders called it. When Alex Wolff of SI visited the campus for a story and took Clark and Anders to the local Bennigan's, the players thought nothing of ordering drinks. As they stewed over their Long Island iced teas (Clark) and Heinekens (Anders), they couldn't resist issuing gems like this one from Clark: \"There are two fraternities. There's Phi Slamma Jamma on the court and Phi Slamma Clappa on the bench. And once you're in Phi Slamma Clappa, you're finished.\" \n \n But Anders wasn't. He rejoined the team a few weeks later. Drexler had departed to the NBA, but the big Swahili was still receiving dimes. With Olajuwon dominating, Houston again reached the NCAA final. Again, the Cougars lost, this time to Georgetown. Again, Anders solidified his cult status. He showed up in Seattle wearing a pink bow tie and cummerbund. He didn't play in the semifinal game against Kentucky because, he told reporters, he'd worn \"the wrong brand of sneakers.\" He played sparingly in the final. \"How can [Lewis] forget the athletes he has on the bench?\" Anders wondered aloud. \"I could have scored at will.\" \n \n According to a story by Mark Bradley in the Hendersonville Times-News, a Kentucky fan named John Gambill had become enamored by Anders, and at the final game he and some pals held up a sign reading BENNY ANDERS FOR PRESIDENT. Afterward Gambill and crew went to the Cougars' hotel and found Anders, who invited them to the Houston team party. Wrote Bradley, \"The night ended with Gambill and a friend riding around Seattle in a Jaguar with Anders and teammate Reid Gettys.\" A week later Gambill received a package in the mail. It contained Anders's Phi Slamma Jamma warmup. \n \n Anders missed the following season with a knee injury. That spring he argued with a classmate at the campus field house. The other student threw a sprinter's starting block at Anders, who went to his car and, as self-proclaimed outlaws are wont to do, returned with a gun. Anders was sentenced to three years' probation after pleading no contest to possessing a firearm on school property. He was kicked off the team. He played briefly in the Philippines and South America, and that was it. He was gone. \n \n The first stumbling block to finding Benny Anders was a simple SEO annoyance. Benny Andersson, a founding member of ABBA and executive producer of the Broadway musical Mamma Mia!, kept intruding on searches. While that was easily corrected, I was having no success in my quest. A search of the usual databases did not turn up a Benny Anders born in October 1963 and living in the U.S. There was a Benny Anders living in Sweden. When reached by phone, that Benny quickly grew confused. When I mentioned Phi Slamma Jamma, he responded plaintively in a heavy Scandinavian accent, \"I don't speak the good English.\" \n \n Often when there's no residential address for someone, there's a good chance he's in prison. But there was no recent record of Anders in the Louisiana criminal justice system, nor in those of surrounding states. Though his arrest record from the campus gun offense showed up in databases, the Federal Bureau of Prisons reported no Benny Anders incarcerated in a U.S. facility. Another records search revealed that in March 1997 Anders took out a personal loan of almost $21,000 from the Community Trust Bank in Bernice, which he has yet to repay. \n \n Talking to those who once knew Anders left only a cold trail of rumors. Benny Anders was a truck driver. He was living in Asia. He was living in Louisiana but going by his middle name, Michael. It was even suggested that he had undergone a sex change. There is an @BennyAnders on Twitter, but the profile reads: \"17, lifeguard, waiter, studying at south devon, Living the devon dream!\" \n \n When I told a friend about my search, he referred me to a friend of his, a private investigator in New York City. The gumshoe had recollections of Anders at Houston, and he offered to help. A day later he called me back, impressed: \"Not much on this guy at all. He knows how to hide!\" He did find a record indicating that Anders had worked in the late '90s for a security firm, J.R. Nell & Son Security, in Flint, Mich. There was, however, no current record of a B. Anders, a Benny Anders or even an M. Anders living in Flint. Nor was there a record of J.R. Nell. The Michigan Department of Licensing claimed to have no information showing that the firm ever existed. \n \n A poster on Coogfans.com, the Houston athletic message board, had a lead on Anders: \"I found this on Google: Prison Ministry. Every Monday and Thursday we have groups that serve at the Clifton Prison teaching Bible Studies, leading Worship Services, and serving Family Outreach. If you are interested in more information or in volunteering, please contact Benny Anders or the church office.\" A follow-up revealed that this Benny Anders was not African-American. \n \n Even in his absence, the legend of Anders grew. When the 2011 Final Four was held in Houston, it triggered the typical \"Where are they now?\" chatter about Phi Slamma Jamma. Inevitably Anders's mysterious disappearance came up. A story that Gettys earlier recounted to the journalist Robert Weintraub made the rounds: \"An agent who places players overseas told me ... he had set up a tryout camp in Louisiana a few years ago. He started with 150 players, narrowed it to 75, then down to 15, then held a full-court scrimmage. So one dude, he's about 300 pounds, is just killing guys. Just busting them up. The agent knew he was too heavy to interest anyone but had to know more about this guy, and asked him his name. \n \n \"'I'm Benny Anders,' the guy said. \n \n \"The agent was shocked. 'The Benny Anders? What do you weigh?' \n \n \"'Two ninety-two.' \n \n \"Shaking his head, the agent asked, 'What are you doing weighing 292 pounds?' \n \n \"'I'm down from 350,' Benny said.\" \n \n It was another classic tale in a compendium so, well, fat that it could be serialized. But it was of little help. No one could recall the site of the tryout camp, the name of the agent or even the league auditioning the players. I sympathized with Charles Jones, the hapless Louisville defender in the '83 Final Four. I thought I had an angle on Anders; he remained one step ahead. \n \n About a year ago, I had a speaking engagement in Little Rock and finagled a side trip to Bernice. Driving the single-lane roads that thread the Louisiana countryside was a little like traveling back in time: cell service was sporadic, women sold vegetables out of the backs of their trucks, roadside motels advertised FREE HBO. \n \n Pulling into town, I steered my rental car down the main drag and turned onto a dirt road. I found the address of Anders's boyhood home. No one currently resides there. At the Bernice Town Hall a woman in charge of records thought she had recently seen Anders and called a friend for more intel. My pulse quickened as she nodded with the receiver affixed to her ear. Then she made a sour face. She'd confused Anders with Willis Reed, who lives a few towns away and is, supposedly, Anders's distant cousin. \n \n I drove by Bernice High, where the Outlaw had been based. It's now an elementary school, though Anders's name still adorns the gym wall. But no one had seen Anders. \n \n Finally I ventured to the address listed for the only Anders in the directory that seemed like it could have a link to Benny. A mobile home rested on bricks several feet off the ground, a bedsheet hung over the door. An elderly woman who emerged claimed not to have seen Anders in years: \"Ya'll keep looking for him, but he ain't here!\" I presumed that this was Anders's Aunt Gracie but could not confirm it because in the most unambiguous of terms she asked me to leave the property. \n \n Maybe a month later I came upon an old blurb on thecabin.net, a newspaper's website in Conway, Ark., noting, \"Ethel and James Lewis McClure Sr. are celebrating their 11th wedding anniversary this weekend with a trip to Sam's Town in Tunica, Miss. They were married April 12, 1993, at the Faulkner County Courthouse.\" The item mentioned that \"the McClures have seven children,\" among them \"Benny Anders of Flint, Mich.\" \n \n Aha! Not only did this support the private investigator's assertion that Anders was living in Flint, but it also gave the name of Anders's father, which had been elusive. A records search revealed that McClure was born in 1946, which meant he would have been young when he fathered Benny in 1963, but it was possible. \n \n When I called James McClure, he spoke genially, if nervously, but denied being Anders's father. He was \"more like an uncle,\" he said, and besides, he hadn't seen Anders in years. I left my phone number, and maybe an hour later I received a call from a blocked number. The woman on the other end would not identify herself but wondered why I had just called Mr. McClure. When I explained my search to find Anders, she shot back, \"Benny don't want to talk to nobody.\" \n \n \"But he's alive?\" I said. \"He's doing O.K.?\" \n \n Click. \n \n Now I had multiple references to Anders living in Flint. And in Bernice, a resident provided a name for Anders's biological father that matched with an address in Flint. I thought it was somehow fitting that Anders might be living in a city that was strong in another era but now deteriorating, a shell of its former self. \n \n So it was that last Wednesday I flew to Detroit and drove an hour north. The Flint home corresponding to the address is a brick ranch house on a main drag, not far from a GM plant and not far from a golf course. There was a dark blue H2 in the driveway and an old Lincoln shrouded in a tarp. A basketball rim, rusted and bent upward, was affixed to the garage. The house appeared to be divided into two residences. A light was on in one kitchen. So far, so good. But my knocks went unanswered. \n \n I wondered if Benny was playing hoops, so I ventured to the Flint YMCA. Jeff Grayer, a former NBA player, was there finishing a pickup game. He smiled when asked about Anders. \"Benny Anders! We used to see him around, but that was a long time ago,\" said Grayer. \"When you find him, let me know.\" \n \n I returned to the home and, in stinging cold, stood on the doorstep, feeling pathetic and somewhat guilty intruding on the privacy of a man who hadn't been heard from in a quarter century. When my knocks again yielded no answer, I was almost relieved. I left a note and a business card in the mail slot, but the gesture was pro forma. \n \n It's entirely possible that Benny is alive and well, that there's a simple explanation for his disappearance. His family's concern? His teammates' cracks\u2014which have become less funny through the years\u2014about witness protection? It might all be a misunderstanding, and he's teaching gym in Birmingham or running a Subway franchise in the Chicago suburbs or working in a cubicle in Bangkok. But someone else will have to find him. I failed. And now I'm done looking. Benny Anders remained a step ahead. \n \n Perhaps, ideally, he should remain there. As it stands, Benny exists as a series of brazen quotes, a flash of pink cummerbund, and astounding dunks, one in a pivotal game\u2014a fleeting vision of athletic perfection and personal cult. Out, out brief candle. \n \n A man named Benny Anders, once the Phi Beta Kappa of Phi Slamma Jamma, is now outside the reach of social media, geocoding, voting records and satellite maps. Outside the hazy memories and unquenched desires of people like me. The Outlaw persists, and I'm O.K. with that. \n \n Follow @jon_wertheim \n \n ANDERS WAS THE KIND OF FIGURE I GRAVITATED TOWARD AS A JOURNALIST: CHARISMATIC, COLORFUL, COMBUSTIBLE, CANDID. \n \n THE GUMSHOE HAD RECOLLECTIONS OF ANDERS AT HOUSTON AND OFFERED TO HELP. \n \n A MOBILE HOME RESTED ON BRICKS OFF THE GROUND, A BEDSHEET HUNG OVER THE DOOR. \n \n PHOTO Photograph by PETER READ MILLER FOR SPORTS ILLUSTRATED HIGH POINT Anders soared for a tip-in against N.C.

He\u2019s not in the Philippines or Switzerland or Swaziland (much less in prison or dead) as had all been rumored. No, he\u2019s on the sidewalk in suburban Detroit, on his way to work at a restaurant. He looks good, too, weighing far less than 350 pounds, as was rumored. He still has a knack for the one-liner. Sitting in all black, his face shrouded by sunglasses, he says at the end of the new documentary, Phi Slama Jama: \u201cA brotherly love is a very powerful thing.\u201d \n \n A dutiful account of the endearing, anti-gravitational Houston Cougars of the 80s\u2014 who dunked their way to three straight Final Fours\u2014Phi Slama Jama is a forthcoming \u201c30 for 30.\u201d And it succeeds as a piece of filmmaking. Aided mightily by recollections from the program\u2019s former PA announcer, Jim Nantz, the film\u2019s director Chip Rives gives the viewer plenty of backstory about this unlikely dynasty. (Discussion for another time: can a team that won zero NCAA championships still be dynastic? We think this qualifies as an exception.) We get the Phi Slama Jama fraternity history, an explanation for how this collection of mostly local recruits\u2014a 7-foot Nigerian notwithstanding\u2014came to prominence. We end up with a heightened regard for Guy Lewis, a twanging proto-Tarkanian, who gambled with talent and tactics and usually won. Until he didn\u2019t. \n \n Still, the documentary\u2019s great revelation is the existence of Anders, thereby solving one of college basketball\u2019s enduring mysteries, a conundrum that had confounded everyone from Anders\u2019 former Houston teammates to his own family. (And yours truly: more on this later.) \n \n If Clyde Drexler and Hakeem (then Akeem) Olajuwon were the Otter and Boon of Phil Slama Jama, Anders was Blutarsky, the ungovernable life of the party who added so much color to this cast. A heroic dunker, Anders also had flamboyance to cast. He was peerless as a quote. (His warning to Olajuwon\u2014\"When I drop a dime to the big Swahili, he got to put it in the hole\"\u2014set a gold standard for sports lines.) This was a guy who showed up to the 1984 Final Four wearing a pink tux. \n \n Anders was called the Outlaw. It was even the personalized license plate on his new Camaro. And it was less a cute nickname than an accurate characterization. He operated on the margins, under his set of rules. Relegated to Houston\u2019s bench in 1985, he complained that he didn\u2019t \u201cwant to play for no Phil Slama Clappa\u201d and quit the team. While he was eventually allowed back, his career effectively ended when he pulled a gun on a classmate after a pick-up game dispute. \n \n After that, he disappeared. Not it the way we usually discuss it in sports. He didn\u2019t retreat to his hometown to reinvent himself outside of sports. He vanished. His whereabouts were unknown. Among his teammates. Among his relatives in is hometown of Bernice, La. In basketball circles. He was a jheri-curled version of a phantom. As a former Houston teammate puts it in the film, \u201cIt\u2019s like he turned the lights out on his existence.\u201d \n \n This was remarkable on a number of levels. For one, it\u2019s a feat to remain anonymous in a time of geotagging and IP addresses and status updates. Also, if you were going to pick an athlete to seek utter anonymity, Anders would have been your last choice. \n \n I know this firsthand. Having recalled Anders from when I was a kid, I wondered a few years ago what had happened to him. When I realized that \u201cWhere is Benny?\u201d was already a parlor game, I joined in. And then got sucked in, venturing to multiple states in search of the guy. \n \n F. Carter Smith/AP \n \n After I published a story on Anders in Sports Illustrated in March, 2013, I received various tips. Benny was using the name \u201cMichael.\u201d He was living in Europe. He had facial reconstruction surgery so no one would recognize him. I also had various middlemen contact me about Anders, claiming they could furnish him. The hitch: there was a request for payment. In one recent case, having explained that paying a source violates a cardinal rule of journalism, I was approached with a counter-offer. In exchange for an audience with Anders, could SI barter a page of advertising for an AAU team Anders was looking to launch? Ah, the Outlaw. \n \n Rives and I talked about his project a few years ago and he went through a similar drill. Rightly, Rives reached the conclusion that finding Anders was a pre-requirement for a Phi Slama Jama documentary. (Full disclosure: I spoke with Rives on camera and appear periodically in the film.) \n \n Rives gathered enough clues to conclude that Anders was in Michigan, where his father lived. With the help of Houston teammate Eric Davis, a former Chicago police officer, Anders was traced to a rental apartment in a neighborhood between Detroit and Flint. A stakeout led them to find and then confront Anders on his way to work. (Rives also confirms that Anders was paid an appearance fee after he was found.) Mystery solved. \n \n Questions still remain. We never learn precisely why one of college hoops\u2019 great cult figures chose to live in the shadows for decades. Or what precisely he is doing now. Or what he recalls from his Phi Slama Jama days. Still, the appearance of Anders in the flesh\u2014the confirmation that he\u2019s alive\u2014is the fitting capstone for a soaring film. \n \n As one of Anders\u2019 associates joked to me the other day, \u201cY\u2019all will have to find a new player from the 80s to go track down!\u201d \n \n Fennis Dembo, you\u2019re on warning, pal. ||||| Phi Slama Jama member Benny Anders found after hiatus \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Photo: Courtesy Of UH Athletics Image 1 of / 4 Caption Close Image 1 of 4 Benny Anders Anders played in 76 games for the Cougars from 1981-84.

    "document": "Legend has it that the infamous Hope diamond brings misfortune to whoever owns it. Well, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History added the magnificent sky-blue gemstone to its collection 53 years ago today (Nov.10), and the institution has fared just fine so far. \n \n As the museum states on its website, it \"appears to have maintained the Hope curse-free.\" \n \n So what's the evidence that the Hope diamond is cursed? \n \n There are plenty of stories of the stone's owners meeting horrible fates, but scholars tend to believe that many of these tales were cooked up or embellished on, at one time or another, by the gem's various owners, in hopes that an incredible history would fetch the diamond a better price in a sale. The diamond has changed hands many times, and for a few periods in its life, the name of the owner is lost to history. \n \n Here, we'll focus on the people who owned the rock for the most significant chunks of time, and whose fates historians can confirm. \n \n The most commonly accepted origin of the curse dates back to 1653, when a French merchant named Jean Baptiste Tavernier obtained the original 115-carat blue diamond in India. The story goes that Tavernier plucked the gem from one of the eyes of a Hindu idol and, for this sacrilege, was later mauled to death by dogs. In fact, the story is a myth: Tavernier returned to France and sold the gem to King Louis XIV for a pretty penny, after which he retired to Russia and died peacefully there. Scholars even question how Tavernier came upon the gem, as a second diamond never turned up, and no one else ever found the statue in question. \n \n Louis, too, escaped misfortune despite his ownership of the \"French Blue,\" as the Hope was then called. However, one of Louis' descendants who inherited the stone was not as lucky. King Louis XVI and his queen, Marie Antoinette, lost their heads to the guillotine during the French Revolution, and their crown jewels \u2013 including the diamond \u2013 were ransacked by thieves. [How Are Fake Diamonds Made?] \n \n A cut-down piece of the French Blue resurfaced in London two decades later, and the financier Henry Philip Hope bought it in 1839 (the diamond is now known by the family's name). The stone's \"curse\" skipped over Henry but came down with a vengeance on a descendant, Lord Francis Hope. After Lord Francis received his inheritance at the age of 21, he married an American showgirl named Mary Yohe and lived so far beyond his means that he was eventually forced to sell the magnificent diamond and declare bankruptcy. The showgirl ran off with one of his rivals and eventually died in poverty. \n \n The Hope diamond exchanged hands a few times before American jeweler Pierre Cartier obtained it, and again the \"curse\" skipped him. In fact, historians suspect Cartier embellished some of the curse rumors to entice the diamond's next buyer, the glamorous Washington socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean, who became the modern poster child for the stone's curse. \n \n McLean and her husband obtained it in 1912 and proceeded to lead a notably tragic life. Her young son was killed in a car accident, and her daughter committed suicide. Her husband left her for another woman and eventually ended up in an insane asylum. In the words of the Smithsonian, \"More than anyone, Evalyn Walsh McLean became the poster child for the Hope diamond's legendary curse.\" \n \n The jeweler Henry Winston bought the diamond from McLean's estate and avoided its curse, eventually selling it to the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History in 1958. The museum, too, did well \u2014 attendance grew and the museum is now home to one of the world's finest gem collections \u2014 but James Todd, the postman who delivered it, did indeed meet with misfortune: He was hit by a truck (not fatally), his wife and dog died not long after, and his home caught fire. \n \n Perhaps the museum is lucky to be one of the owners spared the wrath of the Hope diamond. Or perhaps there is no ruinous curse at all. That's what its market value would imply, anyway: Today the sky-blue gem is worth a quarter of a billion dollars. \n \n This article was provided by Life's Little Mysteries, a sister site to LiveScience.

It's been the subject of dozens of books, games, documentaries and scientific inquiries, partly due to persisting legends that it's cursed. Despite all this attention, though, it seems that the inch-wide, 45.52-carat diamond still conceals secrets waiting to be uncovered. \n \n One of these secrets was recently discovered by Fran\u00e7ois Farges, a professor of mineralogy at the National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris, and Jeffrey Post, the Smithsonian museum's curator of minerals. Using computer modeling, a recently-rediscovered 17th century lead replica and scientific analysis, they've determined that back when the Hope was known as the \"French Blue\" and part of the personal collection of King Louis XIV of France, during the late 17th century, it was likely placed on a gold background and specially cut to produce an effect reminiscent of a sun at its center. Only after it was stolen in 1792, during the French Revolution\u2014and before it resurfaced in Britain in 1812\u2014was it recut to the familiar, smaller shape we know today. \n \n Their new discovery, described in an article published in the month's Rocks and Minerals magazine, stems from Farges' 2009 discovery of a lead replica of the French Blue in the National d'Histoire Naturelle mineral collections, which provided the exact dimensions of King Louis XIV's French Blue for the first time. Both Post and Farges are mineral scientists, and much of their other work on the Hope is concerned with the science behind its distinctive hue, but they've also used the tools of science to investigate the gem's complex provenance. \n \n And the history of the diamond is a complex one: It was bought somewhere in India in a rougher, less finely-cut shape by Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, a French merchant, and brought to France in 1668. \"Unfortunately, Tavernier wrote some really wonderful journals about the trip, but nowhere in them did he say anything about where he actually bought the diamond,\" Post says. It's believed that the stone was plucked from the Kollur Mine, in what's now the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, but no one knows for sure. \n \n From there, it became part of the French crown jewels, and was cut by Jean Pittan, one of King Louis XIV's court jewelers, sometime between 1669 and 1672, eventually becoming known as the French Blue. That the Hope and the French Blue were the same stone was suggested by diamond experts as far back as 1858, but only proved definitively in 2009, when Farges unearthed the lead replica at the Paris museum. At the time, jewelers made metal replicas for extremely precious stones and used them as placeholders when designing settings. \n \n \"They didn't even know they had it. It was in their collection, but filed under lead specimens,\" Post says. Drawings and descriptions of the French Blue had previously suggested it could have been recut to produce the Hope, but the exact physical dimensions provided by the lead replica allowed Farges to collect digital 3D measurements that would prove it. When they compared these measurements to those of the Hope, \"it fit into the French Blue perfectly\u2014you could see exactly how the French Blue was cut to form the Hope,\" says Post. \n \n The replica, though, also raised a question: Why was the French Blue cut into such an uncommon shape? \n \n Nowadays, when jewelers cut diamonds, they use sharp angles on the back of the stone\u2014always higher than 23 degrees, the critical angle of diamond, so that light that enters the gem reflects inside it several times. The ubiquitous brilliant cut, for instance, is designed to maximize the number of reflections that light entering the diamond encounters, thus maximizing the distance that light travels within the diamond. This heightens the brilliance for the viewer. \n \n But the back of the French Blue had low angles and even an entirely flat culet on its back, allowing some light to travel through and straight out the back of the stone. Compared to the rest of the stone, the material right in front of the culet at the gem's center would have appeared relatively clear and colorless, almost like looking through a glass window. \n \n Farges and Post's intriguing explanation: that the jeweler intended for the center of the stone to serve as a window. Along with the flat culet, the French Blue had a series of star-shaped facets that were also below the critical angle, which would have caused the region in front of them to also appear relatively clear. \n \n A 1691 inventory of the French Crown Jewels notes that the gem was \"set into gold and mounted on a stick.\" If placed in front of a gold sheet, they realized, these unique cuts would have caused a dazzling golden sun to appear at the center of the deep blue stone. \n \n Farges and Post have used computer modeling to produce an image that simulates exactly how this would have appeared, shown above. \"King Louis XIV was the 'Sun King,' and so this would have been an emblem representing his power,\" Post says. \"His colors were blue and gold, and so to have a blue diamond with a gold sun in the center\u2014that'd be something that no one else has, something that would almost seem divine.\" \n \n The researchers are planning on comissioning a cubic zirconia replica, cut and colored to match the French Blue, which would demonstrate this effect and could someday be put on display with the Hope to illustrate the stone's transformation and history. They're also scrutinizing archives of Louis XIV's jewelers from that era to look for conclusive evidence that this design was intentional. \n \n One thing they know for sure is that the sun effect was eradicated around 1749, when the Sun King's great-grandson, King Louis XV, ordered the stone to be lifted from its mounting and incorporated into an elaborate emblem. During the French Revolution, it was stolen along with the rest of the Crown Jewels, and although most of the other gems were recovered by French officials, the famous French Blue disappeared. The slightly smaller Hope Diamond\u2014which we now know was cut from the French Blue\u2014was first documented as being in London in 1812, and became well known when it showed up in the collection catalogue of banker Henry Philip Hope in 1839. \n \n More than a half century after it was donated to the Smithsonian in 1958, the Hope is still one of the Natural History Museum's most-visited and well-known artifacts. \"It speaks to the remarkable power of a gemstone. It has generated so much research, interest and curiosity, and it's focused people on a history that might otherwise go untold,\" Post says. \"All due to a gem one inch in diameter.\" \n \n Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Louis XV was the son of Louis XIV. He was the great-grandson of XIV. Many thanks to reader Joshua Stopple for catching the error. ||||| Picture this: You\u2019re on a train that\u2019s traveling fast through the mountains.

It\u2019s like wanting to see a movie star. The Hope Diamond is a bit of a celebrity.\u201d \n \n Post worked closely with Big Fish Games to make sure the information and images were correct. The game is littered with trivia, such as whose statue is in front of the Smithsonian Castle (Joseph Henry, the first secretary of the Smithsonian). \n \n Hope Diamond legend \n \n It makes sense that the Hope Diamond would play a central role in a video game. The story of the real diamond is full of mystery. \n \n A Frenchman named Jean Baptiste Tavernier was the first known owner of the diamond, but no one is sure how he got it. Legend says that in the 17th century he stole a large stone from a statue of a god in India. Because of that, the diamond is supposedly cursed. \n \n Many people around the globe, including kings, have owned the blue stone, and some have had bad luck. The Hope family, for which the diamond is named, owned it in the 1800s but went into debt and was forced to sell it. A rich Washington woman named Evalyn Walsh McLean bought the jewel in 1911. Her son and daughter died young. Was that because of the diamond\u2019s curse? \n \n Post said it\u2019s possible there are shards of the Hope Diamond, just like those mentioned in the game. (The diamond was recut over the years.) He is working with a French museum to figure out more about where the diamond came from. \n \n Post\u2019s favorite story about the diamond is true. When you shine an ultraviolet light on the diamond in a dark room, it glows bright red. That\u2019s because of a chemical called boron in the diamond that makes it blue in the light but a fiery red in the dark. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s something you don\u2019t expect to see,\u201d Post said. \u201cIt\u2019s also one of those secrets of the Hope Diamond. . . .

Their detective work involved computer modeling and a 17th-century lead replica that Farges found in 2009 among the National d'Histoire Naturelle's collection, and led them to an intriguing conclusion: When King Louis XIV possessed the diamond, it was mounted on a gold background and cut in a way that could cause a sun to appear at the blue stone's center\u2014all too appropriate for the Sun King, whose colors were blue and gold, reports Smithsonian Magazine. Louis XIV bought the originally 112 3/16-carat, crudely cut diamond in 1668 from a French merchant who obtained the jewel somewhere in India. Five years later it was recut to its 67 1/8-carat size, according to the Smithsonian Encyclopedia, at which time it became known as the French Blue. In the years between its theft (in 1792, during the French Revolution) and reappearance (in 1812, in Britain), it was again cut to its current size, obliterating those former dimensions\u2014until Farges uncovered the replica, which would have been used by jewelers in need of a stand-in for the actual diamond while creating settings. But the replica made clear that the French Blue was cut in an unusual way, eschewing the sharp angles that maximize the reflection of light. In exploring the reasoning behind the cut, Farges and Post arrived at their conclusion.

    "document": "Scientists are shedding new light on a massive solar storm that narrowly missed impacting Earth two years ago. \n \n \"If it had hit, we would still be picking up the pieces,\" Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado said in a statement released by NASA this week. \n \n The solar storm, which happened on July 23, 2012, was the strongest one ever recorded -- more than twice as powerful as any solar storm recorded in the last 15o years. Scientists say it was actually two storms that combined their energy into one superstorm and followed the track of another storm days earlier. \n \n It was a close call for Earth -- the solar storm tore through Earth orbit only a week after our planet had passed by that segment of space. If we had been in its path, NASA says it would have had a \"catastrophic effect,\" blowing out electrical systems, GPS, radio systems and other technology worldwide, plunging billions of people into a blackout that could take years to repair. \n \n A study by the National Academy of Sciences estimates that the total economic impact of such a disaster could exceed $2 trillion. \n \n Baker told NASA, \"I have come away from our recent studies more convinced than ever that Earth and its inhabitants were incredibly fortunate that the 2012 eruption happened when it did ... If the eruption had occurred only one week earlier, Earth would have been in the line of fire.\" \n \n Solar storms do not pose a physical threat to people or animals or plants, just to our way of life. The real danger is a disruption of our electrical grid, satellite systems and use of modern electronics devices. \n \n Baker and his colleagues published a study of the event in the December 2013 issue of the journal Space Weather. The storm cloud was recorded by NASA's sun-orbiting STEREO-A spacecraft. \n \n In the February 2014 edition of Space Weather, physicist Pete Riley of Predictive Science Inc. warned that the odds of a serious geomagnetic storm hitting Earth in the next ten years was 12 percent. Riley told NASA, \"Initially, I was quite surprised that the odds were so high, but the statistics appear to be correct. It is a sobering figure.\" \n \n Space weather \n \n Scientists have been tracking space weather, including solar breezes and storms, for at least 150 years. \n \n Sunspots and solar flares lead a few hours later to a bright display of the Northern Lights. A solar wind bathes Earth all the time with a gentle, steady stream of particles. But solar storms, like analogous Earth storms, are more violent. The sun is on an 11 year solar storm cycle, with a peak for this cycle reached in 2013. \n \n Storms have two components: large areas of violent activity called coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that are somewhat analogous to hurricanes; and powerful, focused high-speed solar flares you might think of as the solar equivalent of a tornado. Both send large numbers of high energy particles shooting away from the sun. \n \n The Earth is surrounded by its own large magnetic field, the same field that makes a compass needle point north. Earth 's magnetic field deflects solar particles to a certain extent, but the strength of the Earth's magnetic field is decreasing, affording us less protection decade by decade. \n \n Scientists calculate the force of a solar storm on the Earth in units called nanoTeslas (nT), with small, harmless storms hitting values near -50 nT. Prior to the July 2012 event, the most powerful known solar storm, in 1859, was estimated at -800 nT to -1750 nT, although modern measurement techniques were not available then. It knocked out telegraph machines across America. \n \n The worst geomagnetic storm since then knocked out power across Quebec in March 1989 and registered at -600 nT. The July 2012 event would have delivered a whopping -1200 nT. \n \n Geomagnetic storms of that magnitude could cause widespread electrical blackouts. Transformers would be destroyed if they absorbed large, sustained blasts of solar radiation that pushed them to temperatures for which they were not designed. Older transformers and those in urban areas worry experts the most since they are most sensitive to electromagnetic overloads and are hardest to replace. \n \n Any satellite in the path of a strong solar flare could be damaged. A less serious storm harmed a pair of Canadian communications satellites in 1994; it took 6 months to repair the damage. \n \n How do we prepare? \n \n The U.S. National Academy of Sciences convened a workshop in 2008 to address the question: \"Are our institutions prepared to cope with the effects of a 'space weather Katrina,' a rare, but according to the historical record, not inconceivable eventuality?\" \n \n By that point, many industries were already thinking about the impact of adverse space weather on their assets and operations. Since then, more technologies and procedures have been implemented. For example, the FAA can route flights away from the poles during a solar storm, and electrical grid managers can ratchet down power flow through vulnerable equipment. \n \n The NASA spacecraft STEREO-A was able to withstand a full blast of solar radiation near the sun without harm. But not all satellites currently in use would survive. And STEREO will need to take a planned breather from its daily detailed forecasts as it moves into an unfavorable alignment with the sun this year. NASA notes there are other instruments to track solar activity, and flares should be at their low point in the solar cycle. Nonetheless, this year space weather will not be tracked in as much detail as it had been since 2006 when the pair of sun observing satellites STEREO-A and STEREO-B were launched. \n \n But at least for the next few days, we don't have to worry. The space weather prediction is quiet, with a slight chance of a few small flares. ||||| While you didn\u2019t see it, feel it, or even read about it in the newspapers, Earth was almost knocked back to the Stone Age on July 23, 2012. It wasn\u2019t some crazed dictator with his finger on the thermonuclear button or a giant asteroid that came close to wiping out civilization as we know it, though \u2014 no, what nearly ended us was a massive solar storm. Almost two years ago to the day, our most bounteous and fantastical celestial body \u2014 the Sun \u2014 kicked out one of the largest solar flares and coronal mass ejections ever recorded. And it missed Earth by a whisker. \u201cIf it had hit, we would still be picking up the pieces,\u201d says Daniel Baker, who led the research into the massive solar storm. \n \n A solar storm is a generic term for increased activity in the Sun. In this case, the solar storm of July 2012 consisted of a massive solar flare, followed by a colossal coronal mass ejection (CME). A solar flare is initiated by the sudden release of energy stored in the Sun\u2019s corona, causing the Sun\u2019s plasma to heat up to tens of millions of degrees, accelerating and kicking out all sorts of radiation, and often creating a solar prominence or filament (eruption). In a large solar storm, the same energy from the corona can also cause a coronal mass ejection \u2014 a much slower-moving billion-ton cloud of plasma (electrons and protons). \n \n Suffice it to say, but it\u2019s bad news if the energy and plasma from a big solar flare or CME hits the Earth. Much like a man-made electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapon, the solar energetic particles strike the Earth with such force that it ionizes the atmosphere, creating a vast cloud of energetic electrons that bounce around inside the atmosphere destroying electronics and fusing conductive wires everywhere. It would probably take out a few satellites in Earth orbit, too. \n \n Prior to the July 2012 storm, the largest recorded storm was the Carrington Event of 1859. A massive solar flare and CME struck Earth, destroying much of the Victorian telegraph network in Europe and North America. Other solar storms have hit Earth since then, but fortunately we\u2019ve only been hit by one large storm during modern times, which caused the 1989 Quebec blackout. The July 2012 storm was roughly twice as large as the event that caused the Quebec blackout \u2014 but fortunately, thanks to the sheer expanse of space and the Earth\u2019s relatively large orbital distance, we dodged the bullet. \u201cIn my view the July 2012 storm was in all respects at least as strong as the 1859 Carrington event,\u201d says Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado. \u201cThe only difference is, it missed.\u201d [Read: Finally confirmed: An asteroid wiped out the dinosaurs.] \n \n Rather luckily for science, though, the July 2012 solar flare and CME did hit NASA\u2019s STEREO A satellite square on the nose. STEREO A and B are solar observation satellites that have been orbiting the Sun since 2006, providing us with all sorts of delicious imagery and science. The video above uses footage captured by the two STEREO satellites. The image at the top of the story, of a solar flare with the Earth photoshopped in for scale, was captured by NASA\u2019s newer Solar Dynamics Observatory. Using data from these satellites, and from historical solar storms, \n \n If the solar storm had hit Earth back in 2012, the total economic impact is estimated to be around $2 trillion, or 20 times the cost of Hurricane Katrina. It\u2019s not just about money, though: As I covered in our feature story The Machine Stops, it would take time to fix up the world\u2019s power grid. You can\u2019t just magically replace dozens of giant transformers and substations. There are only so many diesel generators to fill the gap. If a giant solar storm hit the Earth, large parts of society could be without power for months or years. \n \n Pete Riley, a physicist who looked at extreme space weather events for the last 50 years, says there\u2019s a 12% chance that a Carrington-level storm will hit Earth in the next 10 years. \n \n It isn\u2019t all bad though: When we inevitably get hit by a large solar event, the resultant geomagnetic storm that wipes out most of Earth\u2019s electronic systems will also generate some beautiful Aurorae. The Carrington Event was so powerful that the Northern Lights (aurora borealis) were seen as far south as Cuba, and the Southern Lights (aurora australis) were seen in Queensland, Australia. \n \n At least the anarchic post-apocalyptic Earth will have a nice backdrop, then\u2026 ||||| \n \n July 23, 2014: If an asteroid big enough to knock modern civilization back to the 18th century appeared out of deep space and buzzed the Earth-Moon system, the near-miss would be instant worldwide headline news. \n \n Two years ago, Earth experienced a close shave just as perilous, but most newspapers didn't mention it. The \"impactor\" was an extreme solar storm, the most powerful in as much as 150+ years. \n \n \"If it had hit, we would still be picking up the pieces,\" says Daniel Baker of the University of Colorado. \n \n A ScienceCast video recounts the near-miss of a solar superstorm in July 2012. Play it \n \n Baker, along with colleagues from NASA and other universities, published a seminal study of the storm in the December 2013 issue of the journal Space Weather. Their paper, entitled \"A major solar eruptive event in July 2012,\" describes how a powerful coronal mass ejection (CME) tore through Earth orbit on July 23, 2012. Fortunately Earth wasn't there. Instead, the storm cloud hit the STEREO-A spacecraft. \n \n \"I have come away from our recent studies more convinced than ever that Earth and its inhabitants were incredibly fortunate that the 2012 eruption happened when it did,\" says Baker. \"If the eruption had occurred only one week earlier, Earth would have been in the line of fire. \n \n Extreme solar storms pose a threat to all forms of high-technology. They begin with an explosion--a \"solar flare\"\u2014in the magnetic canopy of a sunspot. X-rays and extreme UV radiation reach Earth at light speed, ionizing the upper layers of our atmosphere; side-effects of this \"solar EMP\" include radio blackouts and GPS navigation errors. Minutes to hours later, the energetic particles arrive. Moving only slightly slower than light itself, electrons and protons accelerated by the blast can electrify satellites and damage their electronics. Then come the CMEs, billion-ton clouds of magnetized plasma that take a day or more to cross the Sun-Earth divide. Analysts believe that a direct hit by an extreme CME such as the one that missed Earth in July 2012 could cause widespread power blackouts, disabling everything that plugs into a wall socket. Most people wouldn't even be able to flush their toilet because urban water supplies largely rely on electric pumps. \n \n Before July 2012, when researchers talked about extreme solar storms their touchstone was the iconic Carrington Event of Sept. 1859, named after English astronomer Richard Carrington who actually saw the instigating flare with his own eyes. In the days that followed his observation, a series of powerful CMEs hit Earth head-on with a potency not felt before or since. Intense geomagnetic storms ignited Northern Lights as far south as Cuba and caused global telegraph lines to spark, setting fire to some telegraph offices and thus disabling the 'Victorian Internet.\" \n \n A report by the National Academy of Sciences details the consequences of extreme solar storms. More \n \n A similar storm today could have a catastrophic effect. According to a study by the National Academy of Sciences, the total economic impact could exceed $2 trillion or 20 times greater than the costs of a Hurricane Katrina. Multi-ton transformers damaged by such a storm might take years to repair. \n \n \n \n \"In my view the July 2012 storm was in all respects at least as strong as the 1859 Carrington event,\" says Baker. \"The only difference is, it missed.\" \n \n \n \n In February 2014, physicist Pete Riley of Predictive Science Inc. published a paper in Space Weather entitled \"On the probability of occurrence of extreme space weather events.\" In it, he analyzed records of solar storms going back 50+ years. By extrapolating the frequency of ordinary storms to the extreme, he calculated the odds that a Carrington-class storm would hit Earth in the next ten years. \n \n \n \n The answer: 12%. \n \n \n \n \"Initially, I was quite surprised that the odds were so high, but the statistics appear to be correct,\" says Riley. \"It is a sobering figure.\" \n \n \n \n In his study, Riley looked carefully at a parameter called Dst, short for \"disturbance \u2013 storm time.\" This is a number calculated from magnetometer readings around the equator. Essentially, it measures how hard Earth's magnetic field shakes when a CME hits. The more negative Dst becomes, the worse the storm. Ordinary geomagnetic storms, which produce Northern Lights around the Arctic Circle, but otherwise do no harm, register Dst=-50 nT (nanoTesla). The worst geomagnetic storm of the Space Age, which knocked out power across Quebec in March 1989, registered Dst=-600 nT. Modern estimates of Dst for the Carrington Event itself range from -800 nT to a staggering -1750 nT. \n \n In their Dec. 2013 paper, Baker et al. estimated Dst for the July 2012 storm. \"If that CME had hit Earth, the resulting geomagnetic storm would have registered a Dst of -1200, comparable to the Carrington Event and twice as bad as the March 1989 Quebec blackout.\" \n \n \n \n The reason researchers know so much about the July 2012 storm is because, out of all the spacecraft in the solar system it could have hit, it did hit a solar observatory. STEREO-A is almost ideally equipped to measure the parameters of such an event. \n \n \n \n \"The rich data set obtained by STEREO far exceeded the relatively meagre observations that Carrington was able to make in the 19th century,\" notes Riley. \"Thanks to STEREO-A we know a lot of about the magnetic structure of the CME, the kind of shock waves and energetic particles it produced, and perhaps most importantly of all, the number of CMEs that preceded it.\" \n \n \n \n It turns out that the active region responsible for producing the July 2012 storm didn't launch just one CME into space, but many. Some of those CMEs \"plowed the road\" for the superstorm. \n \n \n \n A paperin the March 2014 edition of Nature Communications by UC Berkeley space physicist Janet G. Luhmann and former postdoc Ying D. Liu describes the process: The July 23rd CME was actually two CMEs separated by only 10 to 15 minutes. This double-CME traveled through a region of space that had been cleared out by yet another CME four days earlier. As a result, the storm clouds were not decelerated as much as usual by their transit through the interplanetary medium. \n \n \"It's likely that the Carrington event was also associated with multiple eruptions, and this may turn out to be a key requirement for extreme events,\" notes Riley. \"In fact, it seems that extreme events may require an ideal combination of a number of key features to produce the 'perfect solar storm.'\" \n \n \n \n \"Pre-conditioning by multiple CMEs appears to be very important,\" agrees Baker. \n \n \n \n A common question about this event is, how did the STEREO-A probe survive? After all, Carrington-class storms are supposed to be mortally dangerous to spacecraft and satellites. Yet STEREO-A not only rode out the storm, but also continued taking high-quality data throughout. \n \n \"Spacecraft such as the STEREO twins and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (a joint ESA/NASA mission) were designed to operate in the environment outside the Earth's magnetosphere, and that includes even quite intense, CME-related shocks,\" says Joe Gurman, the STEREO project scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center. \"To my knowledge, nothing serious happened to the spacecraft.\" \n \n The story might have been different, he says, if STEREO-A were orbiting Earth instead of traveling through interplanetary space. \n \n \"Inside Earth's magnetosphere, strong electric currents can be generated by a CME strike,\" he explains. \"Out in interplanetary space, however, the ambient magnetic field is much weaker and so those dangerous currents are missing.\" In short, STEREO-A was in a good place to ride out the storm. \n \n \n \n \"Without the kind of coverage afforded by the STEREO mission, we as a society might have been blissfully ignorant of this remarkable solar storm,\" notes Baker. \"How many others of this scale have just happened to miss Earth and our space detection systems? This is a pressing question that needs answers.\" \n \n If Riley's work holds true, there is a 12% chance we will learn a lot more about extreme solar storms in the next 10 years\u2014when one actually strikes Earth. \n \n Says Baker, \"we need to be prepared.\" \n \n Credits: \n \n Author: Dr. Tony Phillips | Production editor: Dr. Tony Phillips | Credit: Science@NASA",

The sun, on an 11-year solar-storm cycle, has nearly done this before: A massive storm called the \"Carrington Event\" struck Earth in 1859 but couldn't inflict much electrical damage in the age of steam engines (telegraph lines did spark and set fire), and a pretty powerful storm caused blackouts across Quebec in 1989. One physicist says there's a 12% chance of a big solar blast hitting us over the next decade, which he calls a \"sobering figure.\" Another is quoted in the Guardian saying how lucky we are that the blast wasn't in sync with our orbit: \"Earth and its inhabitants were incredibly fortunate that the 2012 eruption happened when it did,\" he says. \"We'd still be picking up the pieces.\" (Read about the sun's newly discovered \"long-lost brother.\")",

When we talk about my own affairs, that\u2019s something else. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d \n \n Asked how he felt about having his name on the list of worst surviving Nazis (he was No. 4 on the most-wanted list in 2012), Katriuk paused. He reached into a box and pulled out a piece of a beehive: \u201cYou see?\u201d he said. \u201cHere they have started to make the royal cell (for a queen bee).\u201d \n \n Pressed further about the allegations, he replied: \u201cLet people talk.\u201d \n \n Rudzik, who was Katriuk\u2019s lawyer for more than 30 years, said his client had lived through some hard times. \n \n \u201cHe would get calls in the middle of the night from nasty people,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cHe was ailing, he had heart problems . . . and he would call me and I would basically do a hand-holding exercise, you know, tell him, \u2018Not to worry, nothing in it, we\u2019ve been through all this, been there, done that, so please, please relax.\u2019 \u201d ||||| The second most wanted man on the Simon Wiesenthal Centre\u2019s list of Nazi war criminals has died at 93 after a long illness, his lawyer has said. \n \n News of Vladimir Katriuk\u2019s death emerged several hours after the Canadian Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs said Ottawa should take the necessary steps to ensure he be held accountable if he were found guilty of war crimes. \n \n Russia charged Katriuk with genocide this month in connection with the 1943 killing of civilians in Khatyn, now part of Belarus. According to war reports, Katriuk was a member of a Ukrainian battalion of the SS, the elite Nazi storm troops, between 1942 and 1944. He had denied the accusations against him. \n \n The Russian embassy in Ottawa called on the Canadian government a few weeks ago to support a criminal case against Katriuk. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, a law enforcement body that reports only to President Vladimir Putin, called on Canada to deliver Katriuk to Moscow so he could be tried for alleged war crimes. \n \n Canada ignored the request and said it would never recognise Moscow\u2019s annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine. \n \n A study three years ago alleged Katriuk was a key participant in a village massacre during the second world war. A man with Katriuk\u2019s name lay in wait in March 1943 outside a barn that had been set ablaze, operating a machine-gun and firing on civilians as they tried to flee the burning building, it said. \n \n \u201cOne witness stated that Katriuk was a particularly active participant in the atrocity: he reportedly lay behind the stationary machine-gun, firing rounds on anyone attempting to escape the flames,\u201d the study by Lund University historian Per Anders Rudling says. \n \n Rudling, whose research was published in spring 2012 issue of Holocaust and Genocide Studies, attributed these details to KGB interrogations released for the first time in 2008. \n \n Katriuk allegedly deserted his SS unit when it moved to France from eastern Europe in 1944. He lived in Paris before moving to Canada in 1951, according to court documents. He later became a Canadian citizen and lived with his French-born wife in Ontario, working as a beekeeper. \n \n In 1999, Canada\u2019s federal court ruled Katriuk obtained Canadian citizenship under false pretences, by not telling authorities about his collaboration with the Nazis, but could find no evidence he committed atrocities. In 2007, the Harper cabinet decided not to revoke his citizenship. ||||| BERLIN (AP) \u2014 German prosecutors say they've shelved their investigation of a 93-year-old former SS officer suspected of being part of a wartime massacre of civilians in Italy because he's no longer fit to stand trial. \n \n Hamburg prosecutors said Thursday that there was a \"high probability\" that Gerhard Sommer could have been charged with involvement in 342 murders for participating in the Aug. 12, 1944 slaughter in Sant' Anna di Stazzema, but that he was suffering from dementia and couldn't follow a trial. \n \n Sommer and others had already been found guilty in 2005 by an Italian military court and sentenced to life in prison in absentia. \n \n But he was never extradited because he would have had to consent to it under German law. Hamburg opened its own investigation last year. ||||| Alleged Nazi war criminal Vladimir Katriuk, a beekeeper of Ukrainian ancestry who lived in Quebec for more than 60 years, has died just as Moscow was preparing a criminal case against him in an effort to embarrass Canada. \n \n Mr. Katriuk, 93, died last week, his lawyer said. He most recently lived south of Montreal near the U.S. border where he raised bees. \n \n \"Mr. Katriuk has passed away, after years of unwarranted harassment, media not excepted,\" Orest Rudzik told The Globe and Mail. Mr. Rudzik served as legal counsel to Mr. Katriuk over the years. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n \"I'm glad he's at peace. He'd been ailing for a long time.\" \n \n Relations between Vladimir Putin's Russian government and Canada are frosty today over Ottawa's strong and vocal opposition to Moscow's aggression in Ukraine. Canada has suspended all but low-level diplomatic relations with Russia and Moscow's leadership has told Prime Minister Stephen Harper to butt out of Ukraine, the ancestral homeland of more than one million Canadians. \n \n Mr. Katriuk was set to become a pawn in Canada-Russia relations. On May 8, the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, a law-enforcement body that reports only to Mr. Putin, called on Canada to deliver Mr. Katriuk to Moscow so he can be tried for alleged war crimes. \n \n The Harper government responded by ignoring the request and saying it will never recognize Moscow's annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine. \n \n Jewish groups have long urged the deportation of Mr. Katriuk, a former member of a Ukrainian battalion of the Waffen SS, the elite Nazi troops, and they increased their demands for action in recent years after new scholarly research that appears to tie Mr. Katriuk to a 1943 massacre of villagers in Belarus, a former Soviet republic. \n \n In 1999, the Federal Court ruled that Mr. Katriuk obtained Canadian citizenship under false pretenses by not telling authorities about his collaboration with the Nazis but could find no evidence he committed atrocities. In 2007, the Harper cabinet decided not to revoke his citizenship. \n \n Mr. Katriuk has said he was forced to join the SS battalion and did not participate in operations with the Germans. He said that while in Belarus, he guarded villagers, livestock and resources from other partisan forces. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n Mr. Rudzik said his former client was the victim of unfair persecution. \n \n Moscow's new demand had threatened to reignite frictions between Canada's Jewish and Ukrainian communities over Mr. Katriuk. \n \n Earlier Thursday, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, which did not know of Mr. Katriuk's death, urged Ottawa to take action on the Nazi collaborator. \n \n \"There have been recent reports that the Russian Federation has requested that Canada extradite Vladimir Katriuk, a Quebec resident originally from Ukraine, to be tried for war crimes he allegedly committed while serving in the Waffen SS during the Second World War,\" Shimon Koffler Fogel, CEO of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, said. \n \n \"While we are supportive of Canada's position on the integrity of Ukraine and the need to oppose challenges to Ukraine's sovereignty, this must be separated out from the imperative to ensure justice is served with respect to Nazi atrocities perpetrated against Jews and others during WWII. We call on the Government of Canada to review this case and take the necessary steps to ensure that, if guilty, Katriuk be held accountable for war crimes committed in collaboration with the Nazi regime.\" \n \n The Ukrainian Canadian Congress, a lobby group with significant influence in the Prime Minister's Office, has urged Ottawa to ignore Russia's demands. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n In a statement provided to The Globe and Mail earlier this month, the Ukrainian Canadian Congress (UCC) called for Mr. Katriuk to be left alone. \n \n \"The Federal Court of Canada in 1999 found no evidence that Mr. Katriuk participated in war crimes or atrocities against the civilian population\" during the Second World War,\" UCC executive director Taras Zalusky said in a statement. \n \n \"Canada's cabinet refused to strip Mr. Katriuk of Canadian citizenship for those same reasons,\" he said. \n \n Mr. Zalusky called Moscow's investigation \"an obvious attempt to distract attention away from Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, invasion of and war against Ukraine, and sow discord among ethnic communities in Canada.\" \n \n In 2012, the Harper government pledged to re-examine the Katriuk case but nothing came of it.",

Russia charged Katriuk with genocide last month, but Canadian authorities refused a request to send him to Moscow, citing Russia's actions in Ukraine, reports the Globe and Mail.

I am, and always have been, 100 percent committed to our United States Constitution and the United States of America. As the daughter of an Air Force veteran, stepdaughter of an Army veteran and sister of a Navy veteran, I am proud of my allegiance to the greatest nation the world has ever known.\" \n \n Yesterday Bachmann's DFL challenger Jim Graves called news that Bachmann had sought to register her Swiss citizen a \"distraction.\" Graves also noted in a news release that he and his family were \"proud to be Americans.\" \n \n \n \n Comments (13) \n \n Could this be that her security clearance might be in jeopardy due to her dual citizenship, or just that fact that this makes her look like she's not a \"Real 'Merkin??\" \n \n Go back to Switzerland, commie! Your kind ain't welcome in the USA! \n \n Members of Congress aren't actually subject to the rules on \"foreign preference\" that apply to federal employees and contractors (or congressional staffers) seeking a formal security clearance -- they just have to swear an oath promising not to reveal national secrets. (This disparity was raised a few years ago, during the Randy 'Duke' Cunningham trial.) \n \n Still, you can't imagine it sitting comfortably with Bachmann's membership on the House Intelligence Committee. Her statement yesterday used language that implied an attempt to talk her way out of the problem; my guess is that it wasn't sufficient for her colleagues and the intelligence agencies, and once again raises questions about her judgement. \n \n She was probably just confused and meant to become a citizen of Sweden. Or Swaziland. \n \n Many people find benefits from dual citizenship and having it doesn't make them any less American. It might have given her more access to travel internationally (if she wished to go someplace that didn't welcome U.S. citizens, but did welcome Swiss). Once again, the press has taken something Michele has done and blown it entirely out of promotion. \n \n How could she not know that the USA does not acknowledge dual citizenship? \n \n Flip flop. :) \n \n It is possible to have US citizenship along with citizenship in another country, methods are usually automatic and can include marrying a foreign national, which is the case with Bachmann. IIRC some of her children were interested in Swiss citizenship, her husband's home country. One can also become a dual national by being born in a country that automatically grants citizenship to those born in the country. This happens more often to children of foreign nationals born in the US, but could also happen to US parents in Canada on vacation. \n \n However, swearing an oath of allegiance to a country in a context similar to the way an immigrant becoming a US citizen, will cause one to give up their US citizenship. Then again, this is true of the reverse as well. After taking the required classes and tests and then swearing an oath of allegiance and becoming a US citizen, one implicitly renouncing any citizenship they may have previously held. \n \n (My terminology may be a bit off in places.) \n \n So obtaining citizenship in six countries might sound like a fun challenge, but would actually be difficult/impossible. In any case, the State Department recommends against holding dual citizenship for various reasons. \n \n Oops, looks like she found out the government subsidy for foster kids is actually lower in socialist Switzerland. \n \n Who cares? What's the big deal. Does it really make any difference? She's a US Citizen, lives in the US so again who cares? \n \n \n \n There is still hope. Remember when she was running for president. She is from Iowa ! Minnesota was never mentioned. Go and take some of your husbands business government money with you. \n \n Cliff said: \"Who cares? What's the big deal.\" \n \n The issue isn't really about what Bachmann did. It's about her constant questioning of Democrats' loyalty to this country and the way she harped on President Obama's birth certificate for years after the matter was settled, the questioning of his loyalty, the insinuations that he was really a Muslim, etc., etc. \n \n It's the sheer hypocrisy, political opportunism and gamesmanship that rankles. Her tactics of total nuclear war on her opponents, her questioning of their very loyalty to this country that's the issue. \n \n This exposes the sham of her stance. She obviously doesn't believe a word of any of the nonsense she's been spouting about the president for the last four years, because she turned around and voluntarily did something that puts her loyalty to the county under question, whereas all the president did was be born as an American citizen from an American mother and raised under circumstances completely out of his control. \n \n She just figured out Switzerland isn't in the U.S.A.",

Police tell Gothamist this was at least the third time over the last year that he was caught riding on the outside of a train\u2014he was previously arrested in March and November of 2017 and hit with similar charges, which clearly did nothing to quench his thirst for the thrill of riding uncomfortably while hanging on by his fingertips. (The NY Post says he was arrested a fourth time in September also for subway surfing, though police could not confirm that.) \n \n Straphanger Matt Beary took the above video around 8:30 a.m. on Friday, between the Clinton-Washington and Lafayette Street stations on the C line. Beary says the subway surfer casually hopped off the train at Lafayette Street. \"I just wanted to take the video because I thought it was awesome and also scary as hell,\" he told the Post. \n \n New York City Transit chief Andy Byford told Gothamist: \"Riding on the outside of a subway car is incredibly dangerous, disruptive, and foolish - it can cause major delays and easily result in death.

Just wait for the next train to come, you can survive waiting five more minutes, and just ride an MTA bus if you want an adrenaline rush. ||||| It\u2019s summertime in New York City, which means the subway is at its most insufferable. Missing a train means waiting even longer in the suffocating heat of the rat-infested underground ovens that are New York subway stations. The trains are packed and sweaty, and the particularly unlucky commuter might get stuck in a car with broken air conditioning. \n \n But one Brooklyn man has allegedly made a gutsy, incredibly dangerous habit to avoid all that, opting to ride on the outside of the train, \u201cwhere fresh breezes and mole people beckon from the velvety darkness,\u201d as Gothamist put it. \n \n It was about 8:30 a.m. Friday when the daring soul missed the northbound C train at the Clinton-Washington Avenues stop in Brooklyn. \n \n After the doors closed, the man, identified by the New York Police Department as 22-year-old Isaiah Thompson, grabbed onto the train from the outside. And off he went, surfing through the subway tunnel while some commuters \u2014 including one headphone-clad man looking at his phone \u2014 rode unsuspecting inside, according to a video captured by another subway rider, Matthew Beary. \n \n \u201cIt was just sort of like spur-of-the-moment, take a camera out not knowing what was happening, but realizing as I\u2019m taking this video that this guy is clearly hanging on,\u201d Beary told Pix 11. \n \n The video, which has now been viewed on Instagram more than 39,000 times, shows the man holding on in a calm, nonchalant manner, even letting down one of his arms. One woman with her back to the surfer is seen gazing out the window at him, her face stunned. \n \n \u201cIt gave me the feeling that he had done this before,\u201d Beary told CBS New York. \u201cAs he rode down he pressed himself against the door tightly so that way he wouldn\u2019t get hit by anything.\u201d \n \n \u201cMy thought was I hope he\u2019s going to be okay,\u201d Beary added. \u201cThe woman next to me had her hand over her mouth in shock.\u201d \n \n Thompson survived his voyage, jumping off at the Lafayette Avenue stop, according to Beary. \u201cClassic NYC craziness,\u201d Beary wrote on his Instagram post. \n \n But on Tuesday, days after Beary posted his video on Instagram, Thompson was arrested at his residence in Brooklyn, the NYPD told The Washington Post. He was charged with reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct. \n \n And according to NYPD officials who spoke to New York news outlets, this was not the first time Thompson has been caught riding on the outside of a train. \n \n Police told Gothamist that he was previously arrested in March and November of 2017 on similar charges.

In January, a 29-year-old man fell to his death between two subway cars while riding on the roof of a New York City train. In 2017, A 13-year-old boy was seriously injured after crashing into a sign at the end of a station platform while subway surfing.

And the number of Americans who engaged in not a single one of those 104 activities in all of 2014 is more than one in four of us: That's 83 million people, or 28% of the US population over the age of 6, reports the Wall Street Journal. \"We feel confident, in a sad way, that this is the largest number we\u2019ve ever seen,\" says PAC member and Sports and Fitness Industry Association exec Tom Cove, who adds it's the most dismal result he's seen in 24 years. The number of completely sedentary Americans increased by 18% since 2007. That's not to say we don't like the appearance of fitness, just the actuality of it: The Journal notes the rise of \"athleisure\" apparel; such footwear saw sales jump 8% in the year ending April 11, while performance shoes took an 18% dive. The PAC traces the decline to our schools, which help form our lifelong fitness habits and where kids are spending less time in gym class and recess. Another problem? The increasingly cutthroat nature of sports is forcing more casual athletes to the sidelines. Says Cove: \"There are way too many kids who leave sports at age 9, 10, 11, because they simply have to make a decision: Am I going to be a travel soccer kid and devote my life to this, or are there other things that I want to do?\" (An editorial argues that it's not lack of exercise causing an obesity epidemic, it's the food industry's unhealthy products.)",

    "document": "Abstract \n \n During 1988 through 1990, California experienced its worst measles epidemic in more than a decade, with 16,400 reported cases, 3,390 hospital admissions, and 75 deaths. More than half of the patients were younger than 5 years; the highest incidence was among infants younger than 12 months. The epidemic centered in low-income Hispanic communities in southern and central California. The major cause of the epidemic was low immunization levels among preschool-aged children and young adults. Rates of complications, admission to hospital, and death were surprisingly high. Outbreak control efforts met with indeterminate success. Problems with these efforts included insufficient funding early in the epidemic and disappointing public response to community-based immunization campaigns. The cost of medical care and outbreak control for the epidemic is conservatively estimated at $30.9 million. Unless the level of immunization in preschool-aged children is increased, this type of epidemic will probably recur. ||||| Bill Gates proves that one person can make a difference\u2014if he happens to be the richest person in the world. Since forming the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\u2014and especially since leaving Microsoft in 2008 to dedicate himself full-time to the foundation\u2019s work\u2014Gates and his wife Melinda have emerged as two of history\u2019s most powerful philanthropists, funding efforts from polio eradication to sewage-treatment plants, and setting the agenda for aid organizations around the world. They have convinced 127 fellow billionaires to sign their giving pledge, an oath to donate the majority of their wealth to philanthropic organizations. Today, the Gates Foundation has an endowment of $42 billion, almost four times the size of the Ford Foundation, and it distributes between $3 and $4 billion every year. As WIRED Science writer Maryn McKenna put it a few years ago, \u201cWhere Gates goes, governments and the media follow.\u201d \n \n So when Gates releases his annual letter each January, summarizing the foundation\u2019s progress and laying out its priorities for the coming year, the world pays attention. Last year\u2019s edition, a feisty debunking of \u201cmyths\u201d about poverty, went viral. This year\u2019s letter, co-written by both Bill and Melinda Gates and released today, is even more ambitious than usual. Titled \u201cOur Big Bet for the Future,\u201d it lays out a series of goals for the next decade and a half\u2014cutting childhood deaths by half, eradicating polio and three other diseases, and making Africa capable of feeding itself, among others. Altogether, the letter predicts, \u201cthe lives of people in poor countries will improve faster in the next 15 years than at any other time in history.\u201d \n \n The letter is modeled on the UN\u2019s Millennium Development Goals, a set of 15-year targets that expire this year and that Gates refers to as \u201cone of the most important documents the UN ever did.\u201d Representatives from every country in the world signed the goals in 2000, pledging among other things to reduce extreme poverty by 50 percent, slash child mortality by two thirds, and cut the maternal mortality rate by three quarters. Although not every target was reached\u2014a full report card can be found here\u2014the document is generally credited with focusing global aid efforts and providing a yardstick against which they can be measured. The UN is set to introduce a new set of development goals this September, and some observers worry that they will be a disappointment rather than an inspiration. Writing for the Guardian, Kevin Watkins frets that the discussions to date have been \u201champered by a paralyzing lack of ambition, weak leadership, and the absence of a credible agenda to galvanise public engagement.\u201d \n \n That certainly does not describe this year\u2019s Gates letter, the most rabble-rousing edition to date. Toward the end, the Gateses announce Global Citizens, a new program to educate and inspire action among the general public. \u201cWe want to give global citizens a way to lend their voice, urging governments, companies, and nonprofits to make these issues a priority,\u201d the letter explains. In particular, the Foundation will ask its Global Citizens to push for a meaningful reboot of the UN\u2019s Millennium Goals, and to hold their governments accountable for meeting those targets. It\u2019s a surprisingly populist approach for the Foundation, which has tended to turn to billionaires for the bulk of its support. \n \n In a wide-ranging phone conversation, WIRED spoke with Gates about this year\u2019s letter, global inequality, and President Obama\u2019s tax proposals. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. \n \n __The UN is working on its update to the Millennium Development Goals. How do you think it\u2019s going? __ \n \n We\u2019re definitely on track. It will be a much longer document, and a broader set of goals than the MDGs were. \n \n But the MDGs were so powerful because they were so succinct. Do you worry that if these goals become too broad, it will be harder to keep people focused? \n \n That absolutely is a concern that I have. Then again, there are unfinished MDGs, and they will always have a very unique position. Key things like child health are so critical. If you have malnutrition you can\u2019t do education very well. \n \n I do think the new document will be so long that fewer people will read the whole thing. Then again, when we talk about books like the Koran or the Bible, not everybody reads every word of those things. I think of the MDGs like the Ten Commandments. \n \n You operate from the belief that the world is radically improving in the fields of health, agriculture, and poverty. But there\u2019s one area that you flick at in this letter where things seem to be getting worse, and that\u2019s climate change. We\u2019ve just learned that 2014 was the hottest year on record. Tech solutions are being developed, but they\u2019re facing headwinds\u2014be it political stagnation or extremely cheap gas prices. Do you have the same sense of optimism when you look at energy? \n \n I have billions invested in various energy-related things\u2014like battery companies, or cheaper ways of making electricity. I have a company that\u2019s working on something called fourth-gen nuclear, this new super-safe nuclear design. So I think it is feasible to have energy sources that are even cheaper\u2014although, as you say, that benchmark gets tougher as the price of natural gas and oil are so low. \n \n There\u2019s no doubt that we\u2019re going to have some warming even as we start to deploy these solutions, because of the lags in the system. Nathan Myhrvold has written a few articles on this, about how even if you do the right things you still have some locked-in change. \n \n I\u2019ve been a big proponent that rich world governments should raise their energy R&D budgets. It is possible\u2014based on the basic science of big energy, nuclear fuels, the photons that hit the earth from the sun\u2014to have cheap energy. In the meantime we have to do some adaptation, which is mostly investing in agricultural systems so that farmers in the areas that will be most affected can have enough productivity and enough storage so that if they have lean years, their kids are not significantly malnourished. \n \n __You\u2019ve dedicated a ton of resources to delivering vaccines to remote areas of the world. It must drive you nuts when people in the rich world choose not to vaccinate their kids. __ \n \n I just read this book called On Immunity: An Inoculation\u2014which is so well written, it\u2019s unbelievable\u2014that talks about this. It\u2019s a little bit unsurprising considering you\u2019re saying to parents, \u201cHey, take this needle and inject it into your kid! Honestly, we\u2019re sure that it does no harm!\u201d It really takes explaining to people why this is not only beneficial to their child but to society as a whole. \n \n The anti-vaccination crowd, it\u2019s very unfortunate. They create risk and in some cases there have been pertussis-based deaths and measles deaths. Those are the two that show up pretty quickly when you get any group of kids that haven\u2019t been vaccinated. People thought, \u201cOK, we have the Internet, information will get out there.\u201d But misinformation got out there as well. \n \n I do think we\u2019ll keep vaccination rates high in the US. Rationality will succeed. But it will take cases like this Disneyland thing to remind people how irresponsible it is. The science about the safety is very, very strong. \n \n Another source of discouraging data: income inequality. You\u2019ve read Thomas Piketty\u2019s Capital, and had nice things to say about it. But you also said that some inequality is built into the capitalist system, and the question is when it begins to do more harm than good. Has inequality become a hinderance? \n \n I don\u2019t think in some huge way. Of course, at a global level, income inequality is going down, because countries like China and India are getting richer much, much faster than the rich world is getting richer. So the overall picture on income inequality is very, very positive. And yet, each country has to look at the fact that, because of the nature of capitalism, there\u2019s a tendency at the country level to have greater inequality unless you have tax policies to moderate it. So it\u2019s a great democratic debate: What should those tax policies be? For the one country whose tax policies I know, the US, I\u2019ve been in favor of more progressive tax approaches. \n \n I also think philanthropy, although not a total solution to it, does moderate the problem. Especially if those who have been lucky give of their time and money to causes\u2014like improving education or health\u2014that speak to the most basic inequities. \n \n So it\u2019s a great topic for debate. A democracy is a self-correcting system, and over time I\u2019d expect them to get it right. The founders were a little worried that the masses would get rid of capitalist incentives by going too far, but at least in the US that certainly hasn\u2019t been a problem. The system has worked well for hundreds of years. \n \n We\u2019re speaking the day of the State of the Union. What do you think of the President\u2019s tax proposals? \n \n I don\u2019t know the specifics very well so I really can\u2019t comment. Just being pragmatic, the likelihood of a change in the tax system is fairly low. But I\u2019ll be very interested. He no doubt will be promoting things that are progressive in nature so it\u2019ll be interesting to see what he picks. \n \n Let\u2019s talk about your Global Citizen Initiative. This seems like a departure for you. How did it come about? \n \n Some 6.5 million children die every year. There\u2019s a subset of that where there\u2019s an earthquake or flood, and people are so anxious to give and help. It reminds you that when people can connect and have an image of what\u2019s going on, in those acute situations, they care and are willing to get involved. But 98 percent of childhood death comes from chronic, ongoing things, not those headline, one-time events. It\u2019s malaria every day, diarrhea every day, pneumonia every day. The idea is that, if you sign up, on an ongoing basis, a few times a month we\u2019ll give you an update on how things are going. It won\u2019t just be a headline about an earthquake. \n \n The idea is getting people to use their voice to say their governments should continue to be generous on aid. We're dealing with tight budgets. Even countries that have been generous, like the Netherlands or Australia, have made cuts to their aid budgets. And within the universe of NGOs, some are agricultural, some are environmental, some are health, you can pick one of those that you want to dive down into and get involved with. \n \n That is a new thing. We\u2019re not sure how well that will resonate. But we do think people\u2019s basic morality, the desire to care about humanity broadly, that it\u2019s fairly timely. There\u2019s a bit of a vacuum there. There\u2019s not an alternate way for people to grab on and see how they might contribute more. \n \n At the same time, critics have grown dismissive of \u201cclicktivism,\u201d little bursts of online activity that don\u2019t result in any sustained commitment or change. How do you keep this from being a mile wide and an inch deep? \n \n The starting point is very shallow. But the beauty is you can use that to get in more deeply. If you sign up to be a global citizen, we won\u2019t send you too much email but we\u2019ll say, \u201cHey, if you\u2019re interested in going to Africa, not only can you do some interesting fun things, but you\u2019d have a chance to get exposed to these issues, see this stuff on the ground.\u201d Once you do that, people tend to get hooked. They\u2019ll see something and latch onto it\u2014a particular village or disease. \n \n But you\u2019re right. Just because we have 10 million global citizens who give us their email address, that\u2019s not our final metric. That\u2019s a starting metric. The metric I care about is people who get involved in real activism, really take trips, really start donating and volunteering. This is just a gateway toward deeper involvement, if we do our job right. ||||| The vaccination exemption rate among kindergarten students in California \u2014 cases in which parents said they did not want their children vaccinated for health, religious or other reasons \u2014 was 3.1 percent in the 2013-14 school year, according to the C.D.C. report. Oregon had an exemption rate of 7.1 percent, the nation\u2019s highest, the report found. Health officials said the vaccination rate needed to be above 95 percent in all communities to prevent outbreaks. \n \n Still, the California figure can be deceiving. Health officials said there were pockets across the state, including wealthy neighborhoods in Los Angeles and Orange Counties and enclaves in Northern California, where the exemption rate jumped into the double digits. California has long been viewed as particularly prone to this kind of outbreak because of its population size and the number of people arriving from overseas. \n \n \u201cThe problem is that there are these pockets with low vaccination rates,\u201d said Dr. Jane Seward, the deputy director of the viral diseases division at the C.D.C. \u201cIf a case comes into a population where a lot of people are unvaccinated, that\u2019s where you get the outbreak and where you get the spread.\u201d \n \n Organizations that have led the campaign of doubts about vaccinations suggested that it was too soon to draw such a conclusion. The groups cautioned parents not to be pressured into having their children receive vaccinations, which the organizations say have been linked to other diseases. Health professionals say those claims are unfounded or vastly overstated. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s premature to blame the increase in reports of measles on the unvaccinated when we don\u2019t have all the facts yet,\u201d said Barbara Loe Fisher, the president of the National Vaccine Information Center, a group raising concerns about inoculations. \u201cI do know this: Fifty-seven cases of measles coming out of Disneyland in a country with a population of 317 million people is not a lot of cases. We should all take a deep breath and wait to see and get more information.\u201d \n \n A handful of doctors seem sympathetic to these views. Dr. Jay Gordon, a Santa Monica pediatrician who has cautioned against the way vaccines are used, said he had \u201cgiven more measles vaccines\u201d than ever before but did not like giving the shot to younger children. \n \n \u201cI think whatever risk there is \u2014 and I can\u2019t prove a risk \u2014 is, I think, caused by the timing,\u201d he said, referring to when the shot is administered. \u201cIt\u2019s given at a time when kids are more susceptible to environmental impact. Don\u2019t get me wrong; I have no proof that this vaccine causes harm. I just have anecdotal reports from parents who are convinced that their children were harmed by the vaccine.\u201d ||||| LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Seventy people have been infected in a measles outbreak that led California public health officials to urge those who haven't been vaccinated against the disease, including children too young to be immunized, should avoid Disney parks where the spread originated. \n \n FILE - This Nov. 20, 2009 photo shows Sleeping Beauty's Castle in winter dress with the iconic \"Partners\" statue featuring images of Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse in the foreground, at Disneyland in Anaheim,... (Associated Press) \n \n New infections linked to the theme parks emerged Wednesday in the outbreak that has spread to five U.S. states and Mexico, though the vast majority \u2014 62 \u2014 occurred in California. \n \n Because measles is highly contagious, people who have not received the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, vaccine are susceptible and should avoid visiting Disney \"for the time being,\" state epidemiologist Gil Chavez said. \n \n The same holds true for crowded places with a high concentration of international travelers, such as airports, Chavez said. People who are vaccinated don't need to take such precautions, he said. \n \n Disneyland Resorts spokeswoman Suzi Brown said officials agreed with the advice that \"it's absolutely safe to visit if you're vaccinated.\" \n \n The people who have been infected range in age from 7 months to 70 years old. The vast majority were not vaccinated, and a quarter had to be hospitalized. \n \n Among those sickened were five Disney employees. Three have since returned to work. The company previously said park employees who may have been in contact with those infected were asked to show proof of vaccination or have a blood test to show immunity against measles. Those with pending results were put on paid leave. Vaccinations are also being offered to all employees. \n \n Measles has hit California hard recently. The state typically sees four to 60 measles cases a year. \n \n \"We are off to a bad start in 2015,\" Chavez said. \n \n Since the outbreak, two dozen unvaccinated students at an Orange County high school were sent home for three weeks after an infected pupil showed up. \n \n Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness that can spread by air through coughing or sneezing. Symptoms include fever followed by cough, runny nose and a blotchy rash. Though the virus has been eradicated in the U.S. since 2000, it can still enter the country through an infected traveler. \n \n While health officials said they likely may never find \"patient zero\" or the trigger of the outbreak, they believe it was either a resident from a country where measles is widespread or a Californian who went abroad and brought home the virus. \n \n People at highest risk are those who are unvaccinated, pregnant women, infants under 6 months old, and those with weakened immune systems. \n \n ___ \n \n Contact Alicia Chang at http://twitter.com/SciWriAlicia ||||| Persons using assistive technology might not be able to fully access information in this file.

However, importations of measles into the United States continue to occur, posing risks for measles outbreaks and sustained measles transmission. During 2011, a total of 222 measles cases (incidence rate: 0.7 per 1 million population) and 17 measles outbreaks (defined as three or more cases linked in time or place) were reported to CDC, compared with a median of 60 (range: 37\u2013140) cases and four (range: 2\u201310) outbreaks reported annually during 2001\u20132010. This report updates an earlier report on measles in the United States during the first 5 months of 2011 (2). Of the 222 cases, 112 (50%) were associated with 17 outbreaks, and 200 (90%) were associated with importations from other countries, including 52 (26%) cases in U.S. residents returning from abroad and 20 (10%) cases in foreign visitors. Other cases associated with importations included 67 (34%) linked epidemiologically to importations, 39 (20%) with virologic evidence suggesting recent importation, and 22 (11%) linked to cases with virologic evidence of recent importation. Most patients (86%) were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status. The increased numbers of outbreaks and measles importations into the United States underscore the ongoing risk for measles among unvaccinated persons and the importance of vaccination against measles (3). \n \n Confirmed measles cases in the United States are reported by state and local health departments to CDC using a standard case definition.* A measles case is considered confirmed if it is laboratory-confirmed or meets the clinical case definition (an illness characterized by a generalized rash lasting \u22653 days, a temperature of \u2265101\u00b0F [\u226538.3\u00b0C], and cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis) and is linked epidemiologically to a confirmed case. Laboratory confirmation of measles is made by detection in serum of measles-specific immunoglobulin M (IgM), a significant rise in measles immunoglobulin G (IgG) level, isolation of measles virus, or detection of measles virus by nucleic acid amplification from a clinical specimen. Cases are considered importations if exposure to measles virus occurred outside the United States 7\u201321 days before rash onset and rash occurred within 21 days of entry into the United States, with no known exposure to measles in the United States during that time. \n \n For this report, U.S. residents were classified as eligible or ineligible for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination according to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for measles vaccination (3). Vaccine-eligible patients were defined as U.S. residents who 1) were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, 2) did not have any contraindications for vaccination, and 3) were either born after 1957 and aged \u226512 months without previous documentation of presumptive evidence of immunity to measles\u2020 or aged 6\u201311 months with recent history of international travel. \n \n During 2011, a provisional total of 222 measles cases were reported from 31 states (Figure 1). The median age of the patients was 14 years (range: 3 months to 84 years); 27 (14%) were aged <12 months, 51 (26%) were aged 1\u20134 years, 42 (21%) were aged 5\u201319 years, and 76 (39%) were aged \u226520 years. Most patients were unvaccinated (65%) or had unknown vaccination status (21%). Of the 222, a total of 196 were U.S. residents. Of those U.S. residents who had measles, 166 were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status, 141 (85%) were eligible for MMR vaccination, 18 (11%) were too young for vaccination, six (4%) were born before 1957 and presumed immune, and one (1%) had previous laboratory evidence of presumptive immunity to measles. Among the 141 patients who were unvaccinated and eligible for MMR vaccination, nine (6%) were infants aged 6\u201311 months and had recent history of international travel; 14 (10%) were aged 12\u201315 months, the age recommended for receiving the first dose of MMR vaccine; and 66 (47%) were aged 16 months through 19 years. Of those 66 patients, 50 (76%) had not been vaccinated because of a philosophic, religious, or personal objection. \n \n Among the 70 (32%) measles patients who were hospitalized, 17 (24%) had diarrhea, 15 (21%) were dehydrated, and 12 (17%) had pneumonia. No cases of encephalitis and no deaths were reported. \n \n Of the 222 U.S. measles cases, 200 (90%) were associated with importations, of which 72 (36%) were importations from other countries, 67 (30%) were linked epidemiologically to importations, 39 (20%) had virologic evidence (i.e., isolation of a viral genotype known to circulate in a country with measles) that suggested recent importation, and 22 (11%) were linked to cases with virologic evidence of recent importation. The source of measles acquisition in 22 cases was not determined through contact tracing or viral isolation (i.e., linking the patient to a country with measles or isolation of a viral genotype known to circulate in a country with measles). Importations were reported during 31 of the 52 reporting weeks (Figure 2). Among the 72 cases of measles importation, 52 were linked to U.S. residents who had traveled abroad, and 20 were linked to foreign visitors. Almost half (46%) of the 72 measles importations occurred among persons who acquired the disease in the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region (Table). \n \n Seventeen outbreaks accounted for 112 (50%) of the 222 cases. The median outbreak size was six cases (range: 3\u201321 cases), and outbreaks lasted a median of 18 days (range: 6\u201369 days). \n \n Measles was laboratory confirmed in 200 (90%) cases: 94 (47%) by detection of measles-specific IgM and measles virus nucleic acid, 69 (35%) by detection of IgM only, and 37 (19%) by detection of measles virus nucleic acid only. Six genotypes of measles virus were identified among samples collected: D4, D9, D8, B3, G3, and H1 (Table). \n \n Reported by \n \n Div of Viral Diseases, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, CDC. Corresponding contributor: Huong McLean, PhD, hmclean@cdc.gov. \n \n Editorial Note \n \n Measles elimination has been maintained in the United States for more than a decade through high population immunity secondary to high MMR vaccination coverage. Coverage with 1 dose has been >90% among children aged 19\u201335 months since 1996. The increase in measles importations and outbreaks during 2011 serves as a reminder that measles remains endemic in many parts of the world and unvaccinated U.S. residents continue to place themselves and others in their communities at risk for measles and its complications. \n \n The increase in importations reflects recent increases in the incidence of measles in countries visited by U.S. travelers. The source of almost half of the measles importations in 2011 was the WHO European Region, which reported >30,000 cases of measles, including 27 cases of measles encephalitis, a complication that often results in permanent neurologic sequelae, and eight measles-related deaths in 2011. Five countries (France, Italy, Romania, Spain, and Germany) accounted for more than 90% of cases reported to the European Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (4). Although measles has been eliminated in the Region of the Americas since 2002 and considerable progress has been achieved in global measles control, measles is still common in many countries. Importations of measles virus into the United States will likely continue and cause outbreaks in communities that have clusters of unvaccinated persons. Maintenance of high MMR vaccination coverage is essential to prevent measles outbreaks and sustain measles elimination in the United States. Despite the relatively small number of reported cases in the United States, the public and the health-care providers must remain vigilant. A drop in MMR vaccination coverage in a community can increase the risk for large, sustained measles outbreaks, as experienced recently in Canada and France (4,5), or reestablishment of endemic transmission, as experienced in the United Kingdom (6). \n \n Occasionally, measles cases are reported without apparent links to importations, but virologic evidence suggests recent importation of an undetected case or chain of cases. Given travel patterns, the highly infectious nature of measles virus, and limitations of surveillance systems, not every importation of measles virus into the United States is detected. Therefore, collection of samples for virus detection is extremely important. Genetic characterization of viruses can help to confirm or suggest the likely source of imported viruses because measles genotypes are distributed heterogeneously in regions that have not yet eliminated measles (7,8). \n \n Health-care providers play an important role in maintaining elimination of measles in the United States. Patients with measles frequently seek medical care; therefore, health-care providers should maintain a high awareness of measles and suspect measles in persons who have a febrile rash illness and clinically compatible symptoms (e.g., cough, coryza, or conjunctivitis) and who recently have traveled abroad or have had contact with travelers. Providers should implement isolation precautions immediately and promptly report suspected measles cases to their local health department to limit spread to other susceptible persons, including those who cannot be vaccinated because of medical contraindications or those too young for vaccination. In several outbreaks during 2011, despite seeking medical care, the source case was not identified until after the first or second generation of cases was reported. Misdiagnosis and delayed reporting resulted in missed opportunities to prevent additional cases because of delayed implementation of control measures. Nevertheless, for most cases, early reporting by providers and rapid control efforts by state and local public health agencies have prevented measles transmission and limited the size of outbreaks. \n \n Health-care providers should encourage vaccination of all eligible patients, including children and adults. MMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all children at age 12\u201315 months, with a second dose at age 4\u20136 years. Two doses of MMR vaccine also are recommended for unvaccinated health-care personnel, international travelers, and students attending post\u2013high school educational institutions. Other adults without evidence of measles immunity should receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine (3). In addition, providers should remind their patients who plan to travel internationally of the increased risk for measles and potential exposures during bus, train, or air travel and at large international events or gatherings (e.g., Euro 2012 and the 2012 Summer Olympics), and of the importance of vaccination. All persons aged \u22656 months who will be traveling outside the United States and are eligible to receive MMR vaccine should be vaccinated before travel. Children aged \u226512 months should receive 2 doses of MMR vaccine separated by at least 28 days, before travel (3). \n \n References \n \n What is already known on this topic? Achievement of measles elimination was declared in the United States in 2000, but the disease remains poorly controlled in much of the world. Cases of measles are imported regularly into the United States. What is added by this report? During 2011, 222 cases of measles and 17 outbreaks were reported in the United States, an increase compared with cases and outbreaks reported during 2001\u20132010. Importations accounted for 72 (32%) cases, including 52 (72%) cases among U.S. residents who had traveled abroad recently. Among patients who were U.S. residents, 85% were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status and were eligible for measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccination. What are the implications for public health practice? MMR vaccine is highly effective in preventing measles and its complications. Rapid public health response and high 2-dose MMR vaccine coverage are essential in preventing measles outbreaks and sustaining elimination in the United States. One dose of MMR vaccine is recommended routinely for all children at age 12\u201315 months, with a second dose at age 4\u20136 years. Adults without evidence of measles immunity should receive 1 MMR vaccine dose, whereas 2 doses are recommended for unvaccinated health-care personnel, international travelers, and students attending post\u2013high school educational institutions. \n \n FIGURE 1.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 From 1988 to 1990, California was slammed with a measles epidemic that affected at least 16,000 people, per the Western Journal of Medicine. Now public health officials are trying to avoid a similar scenario, encouraging people in the Golden State to a) get vaccinated, and b) stay away from Disney parks where the current outbreak started if they're not. Although a Disneyland spokeswoman tells the AP \"it's absolutely safe to visit if you're vaccinated,\" a state epidemiologist warns that those who haven't received the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) shot should keep away for \"the time being.\" Seventy people\u2014the \"vast majority\" of them unvaccinated, notes the AP\u2014have reportedly been infected so far in the outbreak. Measles has officially been eradicated since 2000 in the US; California officials speculate the current outbreak was caused by a foreign visitor or a resident who traveled overseas. The vaccination debate has been renewed, with many health officials lambasting those who refuse to get their shots due to fears about risks. \"[These cases] wouldn't have happened otherwise. \u2026 There are some pretty dumb people out there,\" an infectious disease specialist tells the New York Times, while a deputy director at the California Center for Infectious Diseases urges \"unvaccinated Californians to consider getting vaccinated against measles.\" Even Bill Gates, who has lobbied for vaccinations around the globe, tells Wired, \"It will take cases like this Disneyland thing to remind people how irresponsible [not being vaccinated] is.\" The head of the National Vaccine Information Center, however, says it's all overblown. \"Fifty-seven cases of measles coming out of Disneyland in a country with a population of 317 million people is not a lot ... . We should all take a deep breath,\" she says.",

    "document": "There are three Republican presidential candidates left in the race, and chances are, one of them will be the party\u2019s nominee. On \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d yesterday, Chris Wallace asked RNC Chairman Reince Priebus the question that\u2019s on the minds of many: Isn\u2019t it possible, at a contested convention, that the nomination could go to someone who isn\u2019t already a candidate? \n \n Priebus described such as a scenario as an \u201cextreme hypothetical,\u201d which he considers \u201chighly unlikely.\u201d The Republican leader twice said it\u2019s \u201cpossible\u201d for a non-candidate to end up as the nominee, but Priebus reiterated his belief that the Republican ticket will be led by \u201cone of the three people [currently] running.\u201d \n \n And yet, some in Priebus\u2019 party can\u2019t seem to let go of their dream. Politico reported this morning there are still \u201ctop\u201d Republican insiders talking up the idea of nominating House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.). \n \n On the eve of the Wisconsin primaries, top Republicans are becoming increasingly vocal about their long-held belief that Speaker Paul Ryan will wind up as the nominee, perhaps on the fourth ballot at a chaotic Cleveland convention. One of the nation\u2019s best-wired Republicans, with an enviable prediction record for this cycle, sees a 60 percent chance of a convention deadlock and a 90 percent chance that delegates turn to Ryan \u2013 ergo, a 54 percent chance that Ryan, who\u2019ll start the third week of July as chairman of the Republican National Convention, will end it as the nominee. \n \n The piece, from Politico\u2019s Mike Allen, added that the Wisconsin congressman is \u201cmore calculating and ambitious than he lets on.\u201d It added that Ryan \u201cis running the same playbook he did to become speaker: saying he doesn\u2019t want it, that it won\u2019t happen. In both cases, the maximum leverage is to not want it \u2013 and to be begged to do it.\u201d \n \n The Speaker happens to be in Israel right now, but he called into Hugh Hewitt\u2019s conservative radio show this morning to once again he rejects the speculation. \u201cI think you need to run for president in order to be president,\u201d Ryan said . \u201cI\u2019m not running for president, so, period. End of story.\u201d \n \n Except, it\u2019s probably not the end of the story. \n \n The Republicans and pundits keeping these embers burning have been quick to note, accurately, that Paul Ryan made similar comments after John Boehner\u2019s retirement, saying he wouldn\u2019t be a candidate for Speaker. The Wisconsin Republican, we now know, can be talked into accepting great power when it\u2019s offered to him on a platter \u2013 which means the speculation will continue, probably until the convention itself. \n \n But so long as the chatter continues, let\u2019s keep a few relevant details in mind. The first is the simple fact that if Republicans hold 50+ nominating contests over a six-month period, and then nominate someone who did not run for president \u2013 and has said repeatedly that he does not want to be president \u2013 the prospect of party-wide chaos shouldn\u2019t be dismissed too quickly. \n \n Second, the assumption that Paul Ryan represents electoral magic for the GOP continues to be wrong. The Speaker was on the Republican ticket four years ago \u2013 when he failed to win his home state \u2013 and recent polling suggests the American mainstream doesn\u2019t share the Beltway\u2019s affection for the GOP House leader. \n \n Finally, let\u2019s say for the sake of conversation that all of the obvious hurdles simply disappear. Let\u2019s imagine convention delegates were willing to embrace Ryan without controversy; the Speaker decided he wouldn\u2019t mind being president after all; the party wouldn\u2019t fracture; and polls turned in his favor. Even then, the idea would be dubious on the merits: The Republican Party would find itself in late July with a presidential nominee who has no campaign infrastructure, no platform, no stump speech, no staff, and no money. ||||| POLITICO Playbook: Crisis \n \n Speaker Nancy Pelosi is essentially in open war with President Donald Trump. | Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images \n \n DRIVING THE DAY \n \n IS THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IN A STATE OF CRISIS? \u2026 There\u2019s no doubt we have gotten accustomed to lurching from standoff to standoff, diplomatic row to global skirmish.

And he noted that \u201cCruz is doing pretty well. He\u2019s pulling ahead in polls.\u201d \n \n But Ryan, the VP candidate on Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 ticket, was quick to stress that \u201cI\u2019m the co-chair of the convention, so I\u2019m perfectly neutral on this.\u201d \n \n Pressed, nonetheless, on how he might respond if prevailed upon to come forward as the nominee who could heal a divided party, Ryan was adamant: \u201cNo, I\u2019ve already said that that\u2019s not me. \n \n \u201cI decided not to run for president,\u201d Ryan elaborated. \u201cI think you should run, if you\u2019re going to be president. I think you should start in Iowa and run to the tape.\u201d \n \n Asked why he had opted to stay out of the race this time, Ryan, 46, who is married with a daughter and two sons, said there were \u201clots of reasons\u201d including \u201cPhase of life: I have a young family.\u201d He said he had \u201cthought I could make a huge difference\u201d in his former position as head of the House Ways and Means Committee, \u201cand still be the kind of dad and husband I want to be.\u201d \n \n What\u2019s more, he added, \u201cWe had 17 people running. We had a deep bench of qualified people. So I thought we had that fairly well taken care of.\u201d \n \n Ryan said he ascribed the rise of Trump and anti-establishment Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders to \u201cdeep anxiety\u201d among Americans over the \u201cflat\u201d economy and threats to national security. \n \n Ryan\u2019s trip to Israel is his first overseas visit since he assumed the Speaker\u2019s office last October, and he said it was highly important for him to have come to Israel on the first day of his first foreign trip in the job, \u201cto buttress and reinforce our alliance and my belief in a stronger alliance between our two countries.\u201d \n \n The Times of Israel\u2019s full interview with Paul Ryan will be published on Monday.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Paul Ryan, a man who is not running for president and swears that he doesn't want the job, continues to get about as much press about it as the official remaining candidates. In his Politico Playbook on Monday, Mike Allen talks to a Republican in the know who \"sees a 60% chance of a convention deadlock, and a 90% chance that delegates turn to Ryan\u2014ergo, a 54% chance that Ryan, who'll start the third week of July as chairman of the Republican National Convention, will end it as the nominee.\" Ryan, meanwhile, tells the Times of Israel while on a visit to Jerusalem that he's not interested. \"No, I've already said that that's not me,\" he tells the newspaper. Of course, as Allen and Steve Benen at MSNBC point out, Ryan said much the same thing about becoming House speaker before accepting the job as John Boehner's successor. Saying he doesn't want the job gives him \"maximum leverage\" and sets up a scenario in which he's \"begged to do it,\" writes Allen. Benen thinks those in the GOP hoping for just this scenario should be careful: \"The Republican Party would find itself in late July with a presidential nominee who has no campaign infrastructure, no platform, no stump speech, no staff, and no money.\"",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 President Trump and the rest of the Republican Party appear to be getting increasingly confident that Paul Ryan will be the nominee for the 2016 presidential election, Politico reports. Top Republicans are \"becoming increasingly vocal about their long-held belief\" that Ryan will wind up as the nominee, according to Talking Points Memo. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus has said it's \"possible\" for a non-candidate to end up as a nominee, but he has also said that the nomination could go to \"one of the three people [currently] running.\" Priebus has described a hypothetical scenario in which Ryan is the nominee as \"highly unlikely.\"",

A sheriff in Missouri said a tourist boat has apparently capsized on the lake, leaving... (Associated Press) \n \n BRANSON, Mo. (AP) \u2014 At least 13 people, including children, died after a boat carrying tourists capsized and sank on a lake during a thunderstorm in a country music mecca in southwest Missouri, authorities said Friday. \n \n Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Jason Pace said four people remain missing Friday after the Ride the Ducks boat sank on Table Rock Lake in Branson Thursday evening. He said 14 people survived, and that seven of them were injured. \n \n Patrol divers found two more bodies early Friday, raising the death toll from 11 to 13, Pace said. \n \n A spokeswoman for the Cox Medical Center Branson said four adults and three children arrived at the hospital shortly after the incident. Two adults are in critical condition and the others were treated for minor injuries, Brandei Clifton said. \n \n Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader said Thursday that stormy weather likely made the boat capsize.

Then the wind began to pick up and the water started to churn as a powerful thunderstorm crashed through. \n \n Rain pummeled the amphibious boat, waves tossed it like a toy, 65 mph gusts of wind hit it with spray, and water crashed over its bow. As the boat struggled toward the dock and safety for its 29 passengers and two-member crew, it was overwhelmed. Gripping video footage from the lake showed the boat seesawing and lurching in unrelenting waves. Before long, the small, flat-bottomed, half-boat half-bus capsized and sank, plunging to the bottom of the lake and killing more than half of the people aboard. \n \n By the end of the day Friday, authorities had recovered the bodies of 17, a list of victims that crossed generations, ranging from 1 to 76 years old, many of them out-of-state visitors \u2014 including nine members of one family. Authorities said the captain survived, while the boat\u2019s driver was killed. Branson Mayor Karen Best identified the driver as local resident Robert \u201cBob\u201d Williams, 73. \n \n Late Friday night, authorities released the names of the passengers who died. Four, including Williams, were from Missouri: William Asher, 69; Rosemarie Hamann, 68; Janice Bright, 63; and William Bright, 65. Two \u2014 Steve Smith, 53; and Lance Smith, 15 \u2014 were from Arkansas. One, Leslie Dennison, 64, was from Illinois. \n \n The remaining nine were from Indiana, all from the Coleman family: Angela, 45; Belinda, 69; Ervin 76; Glenn, 40; Horace, 70; Reece, 9; Evan, 7; Maxwell, 2; and Arya, 1. Only two members of the family survived. \n \n Duck boats are a popular tourist attraction in cities across the country, allowing passengers to sightsee by land and water in the same vehicle. The boat here, near this resort town in southwest Missouri, had been on a regular tour around Table Rock. Though Table Rock Lake is normally placid, some authorities and experts said Friday that it is unclear why operators did not heed forecasts and warnings that the potentially violent storm was approaching. \n \n [The violent storm behind the duck boat tragedy was well-predicted, not \u2018out of nowhere\u2019] \n \n Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader told reporters that he believed the boat \u2014 which he said was one of two duck boats still on the lake during the storm \u2014 sank because of the weather. When asked Friday whether he thought operator or design error played a role in the tragedy, Rader declined to answer. The second boat made it back to the dock safely. \n \n Jim Pattison Jr., president of Ripley Entertainment, which bought the duck boat operation in 2017, said in an interview Friday that it appeared the storm came on suddenly on a lake that normally is \u201cvery, very flat,\u201d taking the crew by surprise. He said the boat captain has 16 years\u2019 experience. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re absolutely devastated,\u201d Pattison said. \u201cOur hearts just really go out to everybody, and it\u2019s just something that is very sad.\u201d \n \n Suzanne Smagala, a spokeswoman for Ripley Entertainment, said that the company later became aware of the severe weather alert that had been issued before the storm and that boat captains receive weather alerts by email or text message. \u201cHowever, we don\u2019t know if the captain received it\u201d on Thursday night, she said. \n \n \u201cWhen the weather picked up, the captain turned it around,\u201d she added. The boat was heading toward the shore when it capsized. \n \n Though tourists might have known generally that thunderstorms were expected sometime Thursday, meteorologists had been tracking the storm for hours, and their forecasts offered considerable lead time. The National Weather Service issued a severe thunderstorm watch at 11:20 a.m., nearly eight hours before the storm struck, and at that time, it predicted \u201cwidespread damaging winds likely with isolated significant gusts to 75 mph possible.\u201d \n \n The Weather Service then issued a severe thunderstorm warning \u2014 indicating a violent storm was imminent \u2014 at 6:32 p.m., about 30 minutes before police were called about the boat capsizing. \n \n Marshall Shepherd, a past president of the American Meteorological Society and a professor at the University of Georgia, tweeted that the \u201ctragedy was completely preventable.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis is not 1901,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe have satellites, advanced radars, good weather models, all short-term weather information showed that storms approaching well before the boat was on the water.\u201d \n \n Authorities said they expected to recover the sunken boat late Friday from its resting place in 80 feet of water. Rader said the boat went down in about 40 feet of water but rolled to a deeper point and ended up on its wheels. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s going to take time to know the details of everything that occurred,\u201d Gov. Mike Parson (R) said at a news briefing Friday, noting that the sprawling investigation had just begun. \u201cUntil that investigation is completed, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s my place or anyone\u2019s place to speculate all the things that could have happened or why they happened.\u201d \n \n The duck boat that sank Thursday was owned by Ride the Ducks Branson, a tourism company that takes people on tours of the Ozarks by land and water using the amphibious vehicles. Ride the Ducks is a national duck tour operator with locations across the United States, and Ripley\u2019s purchase of the Branson company last year added to its collection of more than 100 entertainment venues. Those include the Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not! franchise and the Guinness World Records Attractions, as well as mazes, haunted houses, traveling shows and other attractions across the United States and 10 other countries worldwide. \n \n Pattison told The Post on Friday that the company bought Ride the Ducks Branson \u2014 to date, Ripley\u2019s only duck boat outfit \u2014 in part because Ripley already had a Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not! Odditorium in Branson. \n \n A press release announcing the purchase described the tour as a 70-minute, guided amphibious tour that takes passengers through the Ozarks. At the time of the announcement, the company operated 22 duck vehicles from March to November. The announcement has since been removed from Ripley\u2019s website. \n \n Duck boats were originally developed as amphibious military vehicles used in beach landings. The duck boat tours in Branson include a trip up a nearby mountain to look at decades-old military equipment. \n \n While some tourism duck boats were converted from the Army\u2019s World War II-era \u201cDUKW\u201d boats, those used by Ride the Ducks Branson were replicas, the company said, updated with modern safety equipment. \n \n Smagala said the boat tragedy was the first accident involving the duck boats in Branson. The company has been operating in the city for 40 years and is \u201ca staple of Branson,\u201d Smagala said. \n \n Federal investigators also headed to the scene to join state and local officials, with the National Transportation Safety Board dispatching a \u201cGo Team\u201d to the lake to help probe the latest disaster involving duck boats, which have been involved in several fatal accidents in water and on land. Thirteen people died in 1999 when a duck boat took on water and sank while touring Lake Hamilton in Hot Springs, Ark. The NTSB found that when the boat was converted for tourism, it was not given enough built-in buoyancy to stay afloat if flooded. Just seven minutes after that boat entered the lake, it sank in 60 feet of water. \n \n In 2015, a Ride the Ducks boat crashed into a charter bus on the Aurora Bridge in Seattle; five college students were killed and dozens of other people injured. Ride the Ducks International agreed the following year to pay $1 million for violating federal safety regulations, according to the Seattle Times. \n \n \n \n Flowers and a note rest on a car believed to belong to a victim of the duck boat accident in Branson, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) \n \n Two passengers on a duck boat were killed in 2010 near Philadelphia when a barge collided with the smaller vessel. The NTSB determined that the accident \u2014 which caused the duck boat to sink \u2014 occurred because the person guiding the barge was focused on his cellphone, although federal investigators also criticized the duck boat\u2019s operator, Ride the Ducks, for actions they said contributed to the accident. \n \n Some of the deadly accidents show dangers that come with some versions of the hybrid vessels. Often the boats are covered by thick canopies that shield riders from the sun and rain, but can create an obstacle to safety in emergencies, trapping passengers inside as the vessels sink. \n \n Four of the passengers who died on the Miss Majestic in 1999 in Arkansas were pinned against the underside of the canopy. \n \n \u201cContributing to the high loss of life was a continuous canopy roof that entrapped passengers within the sinking vehicle,\u201d an NTSB report on the incident said. \n \n The Coast Guard issued nationwide standards for inspections of the vehicles in December 2000, which still cover the industry. The NTSB recommended in 2002 that built-in flotation devices or other means be added to the retrofitted military boats to make sure the vessels \u201cremain afloat and upright.\u201d \n \n The duck boats in Branson are popular with tourists and locals alike, said Best, the mayor. She said she could not recall previous problems with the two companies that have operated the boats in the 16 years she has lived in Branson. \n \n \u201cThe duck boats are such a great asset to our community,\u201d she said. \u201cAs a local, I\u2019ve ridden in them I can\u2019t tell you how many times.\u201d \n \n 1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The scene after a duck boat sinks, killing 17 during a storm near Branson, Mo.

The vacationers from Panama planned to stay in the nation\u2019s capital for a week, and they said they had no intention of changing their plans to ride the duck boat. \n \n \u201cOne random accident doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re a bad company,\u201d said Gabby Valdonedo, 25. \u201cIt\u2019s a good way to see the city.\u201d \n \n Her sister, Monique Valdonedo, 19, added that duck boats are \u201cway more fun than going down the Metro.\u201d \n \n But other tourists expressed some concern about the amphibious tours. Tiffany Li, 19, was visiting Washington with a friend on Friday and considered taking a DC Duck tour to pass time before their train back to New York. \n \n \u201cClearly it\u2019s a safety issue,\u201d said Kume. \u201cThe boats don\u2019t seem that stable, but tourists don\u2019t know any better. They just pay to have fun.\u201d \n \n Li compared the danger to riding a roller coaster at an amusement park. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to question things when you\u2019re having a good time, so you just don\u2019t think about it,\u201d she said. \n \n Ultimately, they decided against taking the tour, though Li said the decision was based more on money than safety. \n \n Branson, near the Arkansas border, is a destination for country and live-music fans, with many acts covering Elvis, Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton standards. Its main boulevard includes Dolly Parton\u2019s Dixie Stampede Dinner Attraction, and Silver Dollar City, an 1800s-themed amusement park. Best, who is in her second term in office, said the city has about 10,000 residents and welcomes more than 8 million visitors yearly; July is one of its busiest months. \n \n Best and her staff prepared Branson City Hall as a refuge for those waiting for news of their loved ones, and the city brought in certified grief counselors. Best said she saw one of the grief counselors take wet socks from a young man and dry them with the bathroom hand drier. \u201cThat was such a small thing, but for that young man, having dry socks was such an improvement from being cold and wet,\u201d she said. \u201cLittle things like that meant a lot to the families.\u201d \n \n Seven passengers were injured, and two of those were in serious condition. \n \n Williams, the driver of the boat, lived in Branson with his wife of 30 years. He was described as having loved his role promoting Branson. \n \n \u201cEvery time you saw him he was smiling,\u201d Best said. \u201cHe was a great guy. He loved Branson.\u201d \n \n Victor Richardson, a grandson of Williams\u2019s, said in a telephone interview that \u201che was the calmest spirit you could ever meet.\u201d \n \n Police were called about the duck boat sinking shortly after 7 p.m. Thursday, officials said. While dive teams headed to the scene, people already there began to help, Rader said. Among those helping were one of his deputies, who was off-duty and providing security on the Branson Belle, a showboat used for lake tours. \n \n The weather had been nice until shortly before the disaster, Allison Lester, who saw what happened from a nearby boat, said in a television interview. \n \n \u201cThe wind really picked up bad, and debris was flying everywhere, and just the waves were really rough,\u201d Lester told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d on Friday. \u201cIt was just suddenly and out of nowhere.\u201d \n \n In video captured by onlookers from the lake, two duck boats can be seen plunging up and down in choppy waves and high spray. One boat lags behind the other, nose-diving into the water. \n \n \u201cOh my gosh, oh no,\u201d a woman is heard saying in the background of the video. \u201cSomebody needs to help them.\u201d \n \n Crazy storm... 17 fatalities on Table Rock Lake.

Authorities in Branson, Missouri, have confirmed that at least 13 people, including children, died Thursday night when an amphibious boat carrying tourists capsized and sank in Table Rock Lake. Missouri State Highway Patrol Sgt. Jason Pace said Friday that four people remain missing, reports the AP. He added that 14 people survived, and that seven of them were injured. Stone County Sheriff Douglas Rader said the boat apparently sank due to intense winds and thunderstorms in the area, reports the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A blustery day on a Virginia bridge led to a truck driver's death Thursday, the AP reports. Joseph Chen, a 47-year-old employee of Evans Transport, was crossing the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in his tractor-trailer around 12:30pm, shortly after weather reports had indicated a Level 1 wind advisory, meaning winds were clocking in at over 40mph, the Virginian-Pilot reports. The North Carolina man was driving his truck southbound when his vehicle went over the side and into the 45-degree Chesapeake Bay. As his truck began to sink, Chen was spotted standing atop it, offering hope he'd survive the freak accident. But after a Navy chopper pulled him from the water, he died en route to the hospital. Just 30 minutes after Chen's truck was swept off the bridge, the wind advisory was raised to a Level 2, which means winds had crept up past 47mph.

They are asking regulators to apply tougher rules on San Francisco-based Uber, whose software allows customers to order a ride from drivers who don\u2019t need licenses that can cost 200,000 euros ($270,000) apiece. \n \n The biggest city-center protest was in London, where black-cab drivers were joined by private car services and trainees to protest what they saw as the government\u2019s failure to hold Uber to the same standards as other car services and taxis. While similar demonstrations this year have led to smashed windshields and traffic chaos in Paris, a united front in Europe highlights the challenges for Uber\u2019s expansion. \n \n Related: \n \n \u201cA strike won\u2019t work,\u201d European Commission Vice President Neelie Kroes said in a statement today. \u201cWhat we need is real dialogue where we talk about these disruptions caused by technology.\u201d \n \n Photographer: Simon Dawson/Bloomberg London taxi drivers next to their parked cabs on The Mall, leading away from Buckingham Palace, during a protest against Uber Technologies Inc.'s car sharing service on June 11, 2014.

Out of some 128 cities it serves, 20 are in Europe, including Manchester, Lyon and Zurich. \n \n Tourist Hubs \n \n In London, thousands of black cabs and private hire cars descended on the tourist hubs of Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square, blocking some of the city\u2019s busiest streets. Scooter and motorbike riders studying for the cab-driver exam joined in, honking their horns as the police tried to regulate traffic. \n \n London taxi drivers have said that the app\u2019s fare calculator amounts to a meter, which aren\u2019t allowed in hired cars that aren\u2019t registered taxis. Last month, TFL asked the High Court to rule on whether the fare system was legal. \n \n \u201cWe have to have a license to own a cab, we have to have a driver\u2019s license, a cab driver\u2019s license,\u201d said Mark Haslam, a 58-year-old black-cab driver, who took part in the protest. \u201cFor some reason they seem to be outside the law.\u201d \n \n Another driver, John Maloney, 64, was standing on top of a black cab on the corner of Whitehall and Trafalgar Square with a sign saying \u201cenforce the law.\u201d He was dressed as a judge, wearing a white wig and black cape. \n \n Photographer: Angel Navarrete/Bloomberg Spanish flags fly from a taxi cab painted with graffiti reading \"RIP Uber Taxi G$$gle\" as it leads demonstrators along a city highway to protest against the Uber Technologies Inc. taxi app in central Madrid, today.

The London police, saying organizers hadn\u2019t asked for proper permission to assemble, had threatened to arrest protesters if they arrived before 2 p.m. and didn\u2019t leave by 3 p.m. \n \n London organizers had called on drivers to join the demonstrations with posters mimicking a World War I recruiting campaign, featuring military commander Horatio Kitchener and his characteristic handlebar mustache. \n \n In Paris, drivers blocked the Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports this morning and prevented private-car services from picking up passengers, said Nadine Annet, vice president at the FNAT taxi association. Cabbies also slowed down traffic the A1 highway that circles Paris, leading to a 200-kilometer (120-mile) jam, local TV reported. The vast majority of France\u2019s 55,000 professional taxis and Paris\u2019s 15,000 cabs are on strike today, Annet said. \n \n Kader Djielouli, a 44-year-old protester who\u2019s been driving taxis in Paris for 15 years, said he\u2019s lost 40 percent of his revenue since 2009 because of services like Uber. \n \n Paris, Madrid \n \n Private-car services \u201care taxis without being taxis,\u201d he said at a cab stand near the Opera metro station in Paris. \u201cWe are against them.

Photorgapher: Fred Dufour/AFP via Getty Images \n \n In Madrid, thousands of drivers marched to block the Paseo de la Castellana, one of the city\u2019s main avenues, as police escorted the demonstration by cars, a helicopter and officers on foot. Protesters chanted insults targeted at Uber and chased taxis that weren\u2019t taking part in the rally. \n \n In Berlin, more than 500 taxis lined up in columns of 20 in the plaza stretching out from the Olympic stadium. Four youth chanting \u201cfriends of Uber\u201d were escorted away by security under shouts of a few enraged drivers. \n \n Berlin cabs earlier packed airports and the upscale Kurfuerstendamm shopping district. At the Tegel airport, one of the three starting locations for the Berlin demonstration, taxi driver Kubilay Sarikaya said this morning he was skeptical about the protests. While he\u2019d been working since 3 a.m., he said he\u2019ll go along if his friends do. \n \n \u201cWhile we are demonstrating, the other guys are hauling people around,\u201d said Sarikaya, 33. \u201cThere have to be other ways. Ultimately I think folks know that they can always count on the good old cab to get them where they need to be.\u201d \n \n Berlin, Milan \n \n In Milan, no taxi was to be seen after about 5,000 drivers this morning went on a strike that is set to last until 10 p.m. \n \n Uber took the demonstrations as an opportunity to promote its service, saying in a statement its teams across Europe will keep the cities moving today. \n \n \u201cWhile the taxi protests may seek to bring Europe to a standstill, we\u2019ll be on hand to get our riders from A to B.\u201d \n \n Uber also chose this morning to open its service in London to black-cab drivers, describing its 5 percent commission as the lowest of all booking systems in the city. Uber has thus far offered luxury cars and cheaper rides in London, while excluding licensed black cabs. Later in the day, Uber said signups in London to its service today were 850 percent higher than last Wednesday, declining to give the actual number. \n \n Internet Backlash \n \n The protests have a deeper significance beyond the taxi industry. They underscore the growing backlash against the likes of room-booking service Airbnb Inc. and video-streaming provider Aereo Inc. as they clash with traditional industries arguing the competitors should be subject to the same regulations. \n \n \u201cEuropean cities have tended to regulate taxi drivers much more than the U.S.,\u201d said Charles Lichfield, an analyst at Eurasia Group in London. \u201cI do think the protests have a better chance of succeeding.\u201d \n \n In the U.S., local taxi groups have also lobbied against Uber and similar services in cities such as Seattle. In Europe, regulators and courts are struggling with the disconnect between the desire to protect a regulated industry and the need for more technological innovation. \n \n \u201cFor years the government has slapped new fees onto taxis and imposed more constraints -- everything from car colors to, now, GPS tracking,\u201d FNAT\u2019s Annet said. \u201cThe least we\u2019re asking for is that our competitors get the same tough love.\u201d \n \n French Court \n \n Following complaints by Paris cab drivers, France this year imposed a rule on private services, requiring a minimum 15-minute wait between the time a car is booked and the passenger is picked up. The decree was later struck down by the country\u2019s constitutional court. \n \n Hamburg\u2019s economy ministry on June 6 issued an order preventing Wundercar, a German peer of Uber, from operating in the city, saying that transporting people for profit and without a license is against the law. Berlin administrators are probing a similar move against Uber, spokeswoman Petra Rohland said. A Berlin court banned the Uber Black chauffeur service in April, although the injunction hasn\u2019t been enforced. \n \n The Spanish region of Catalonia said yesterday it will ask Uber -- which is available in Barcelona -- to immediately stop its activities in the area. The regional government is also telling security forces to increase control and detection of illegal taxi services. \n \n European Regulation \n \n \u201cConsumers want to have these services. I\u2019ve personally never sat in a run-down Uber car, but I\u2019ve definitely experienced a lot of run-down taxis,\u201d said Arndt Ellinghorst, head of automotive research at ISI Group in London. \u201cIt is a bit scary how protectionist Europe can be.\u201d \n \n Uber raised $1.2 billion in new financing led by Fidelity Investments last week, valuing the company at about $17 billion, before added investments. The company had earlier raised $307.5 million from investors including Google Ventures, TPG Capital and Menlo Ventures. \n \n The company\u2019s assets may be worth just $5.9 billion, Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University, wrote on his blog this week. He said the figure was based on optimistic assumptions about the taxi industry\u2019s growth and Uber\u2019s market share and profitability. \n \n Lower Prices \n \n Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick -- who started Uber in 2009 after he and partner Garrett Camp couldn\u2019t find a cab in Paris -- has pushed the company into 37 countries. He said the low prices and ease of use that their drivers can offer will lead to a base of support from consumers that regulators won\u2019t be able to ignore. \n \n A typical journey from Finsbury Square, near London\u2019s financial district, and Paddington Station takes between 20 and 30 minutes by car to travel approximately four miles. Uber estimates that that journey would cost between 14 pounds ($24) and 16 pounds. London\u2019s transportation authority estimates that the trip could cost between 15 pounds and 22 pounds. \n \n The German market for taxis and rental cars was 4.3 billion euros last year, said Michael Mueller, the president of the German Association of Taxis and Rental Cars. It would shrink by 1 billion euros at the price levels Uber advocates, he said. \n \n Job Creation \n \n Uber said in its blog it\u2019s responsible for 20,000 new jobs per month. The median income for drivers using the UberX platform, Uber\u2019s low-cost service, is $90,000 per year in New York and more than $74,000 in San Francisco, the company said. \n \n Uber advertises itself to prospective drivers as a way to start your own business, drawing users who aren\u2019t professional chauffeurs. That\u2019s different from apps such as Hailo, which recruit from the industry.

In Berlin hundreds choked the main road to the city's historic centre while commuters juggled buses and trains, or simply walked, to get to work in Madrid and Barcelona. \n \n San Francisco-based Uber Technologies Inc., valued last week at $18.2 billion just four years since its 2010 launch, has touched a raw nerve by bringing home the threat of technological advances to one of the world's most visible trades. \n \n \"This about an all out assault on our profession, our livelihoods,\" said Max Small, a driver of one of London's black taxis for 34 years. \"These big companies are coming in, not playing by the rules.\" \n \n Taxi drivers across Europe level a variety of charges against Uber: that its applications break local taxi rules; that its drivers fail to comply with local insurance rules; and that it is therefore in breach of licensing and safety regulations. \n \n Uber, backed by investors such as Goldman Sachs and Google, refute all those allegations, a spokeswoman said. Uber said it, its applications and its drivers comply with local regulations. \n \n \"What you are seeing today is an industry that has not faced competition for decades. Now finally we are seeing competition from companies such as Uber which is bringing choice to customers,\" said Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, Uber Regional General Manager for Europe. \n \n \"Across a number of different countries the taxi industry is very similar - an industry which is highly regulated and arranged in a way that is not pro-consumer but just promotes protectionism.\" \n \n UBER \n \n Uber has expanded rapidly since it was founded by two U.S. technology entrepreneurs, Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp, and now operates in 128 cities across 37 countries. \n \n Uber Chief Executive Officer Kalanick last week announced $1.2 billion in new funding, valuing the company at $18.2 billion, one of the highest valuations ever for a Silicon Valley startup. [ID:nL1N0ON1G6] But it has faced a series of hurdles from the beaches of Miami to the piazzas of Rome. Ordinances keep it out of cities such as Las Vegas and Miami while in Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., Uber and similar companies have faced lawsuits from taxi companies hoping to keep the new competition out. \n \n In London, the European Union's biggest city by population, police helicopters monitored the traffic snarl around the seat of the British government as mopeds and cyclists tried to navigate the chaos and crowds of bemused tourists looked on. \n \n Uber says its fares are cheaper than black taxis in London. Other taxi drivers allege Uber's technology is effectively a taximeter and thus contravenes a 1998 British law reserving the right to use a meter for licensed black taxis. [ID:nL6N0OK2AA] \n \n They say the city's transport regulator, Transport for London, is failing to enforce the rules. The regulator says its provisional view is that smart phone applications do not constitute a taximeter but has asked the High Court for a view. \n \n After the disruptions, Uber hit back in Germany by emailing its clients offering a 50 percent discount on all shared rides for the duration of the day. In London the company offered new customers 20 pounds ($33.58) off their first journey. \n \n In Spain, the Ministry of Public Works has warned that companies or individuals offering Uber-type services faced fines of up to 6,000 euros, while users could be fined up to 600 euros. The ministry has not specifically named Uber. \n \n Neelie Kroes, the European Union commissioner in charge of digital and telecoms policy, said responding to companies like Uber with strikes was pointless. \"We cannot address these challenges by ignoring them, by going on strike, or by trying to ban these innovations out of existence,\" she said in a blog published on Wednesday. \n \n It was an argument that failed to sway taxi drivers around Europe, however. \n \n \"Yes this is chaos, its causing havoc in the very centre of London, but what other choice have we got?\" said Ian Hay, a taxi driver with 14 years experience. \n \n ($1 = 0.5956 British Pounds) \n \n (Additional reporting by Sonya Dowsett and Paul Day in Madrid, Nicholas Vinocur in Paris, Robin Emmott in Brussels and Anja Nilsson in Berlin; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)",

    "document": "During Charles Darwin\u2019s journey to the Gal\u00e1pagos in the 1830s, he noted the existence of \u201ca curious group of finches\u201d found only on the islands. The story that those birds inspired the theory of evolution has long been doubted. But the finches still bear Darwin\u2019s name and are prized by biologists as one of the best examples of speciation\u2014the process by which new species arise. \n \n Now, research suggests that at least some of Darwin\u2019s famous finches might soon be driven to extinction by parasitic flies introduced to them by humans in the 1960s. A paper published this week in the Journal of Applied Ecology blames the parasitic nest fly Philornis downsi for the threat to Geospitza fortis, also known as the medium ground finch. \n \n While adult P. downsi flies are not themselves parasitic, they lay their eggs in bird nests. The eggs hatch into maggots, which feed on both brooding adult finches and their babies. The adult birds are unaffected, but it\u2019s another story with the tiny nestlings. P. downsi kills huge numbers of baby birds among Darwin\u2019s finches and other land birds. The flies can be found on every island in the Gal\u00e1pagos. \n \n \u201cThis is like a really bad horror flick,\u201d senior author Dale Clayton, an ecologist and parasite specialist at the University of Utah, says with a rueful laugh. \u201cThe babies can\u2019t withstand even one night with these parasites.\u201d The susceptibility of the baby finches has something to do with their size\u2014Clayton compares the newly-hatched birds to peanut M&M's\u2014and their immune responses. \n \n The sight of a parasite-infested G. fortis isn\u2019t just alarming because of the tiny bird\u2019s anemic looks and bulging lesions. It is also a harbinger of the species\u2019 coming extinction. Clayton and his team used five years of field data to predict the species\u2019 long-term viability and found that, in two out of three scenarios, medium ground finches could be gone within the next century. \n \n The team first manipulated the parasite load in actual nests, studying only the medium ground finches, which are the most abundant and have the most accessible nests. They created a control group of nests that they sprayed with plain water, while a second set of nests was sprayed with permethrin, an insecticide that is also used to kill mosquitoes, lice and ticks. The use of treated and untreated nests allowed the team to determine the direct effects of the flies on the birds. They then used that data in models of good, bad and neutral years for the birds\u2019 reproduction and ultimate survival. \n \n The team predicts that if the finches were to run into a series of bad reproductive years in which extreme weather cuts off their food supply, they\u2019d go extinct in about 50 years. A model weighted toward neutral years indicates they\u2019d be extinct within about 80 years. Unsurprisingly, a run of good reproductive luck would spell longer survival for the species: about 100 years. Reducing the number of flies could help the birds hold on even longer, or even prevent them from going extinct at all. \n \n While Clayton\u2019s team focused on medium ground finches, given that there are at least 14 species of Darwin's finches in the Gal\u00e1pagos\u2014and that they are so closely related\u2014the problem likely extends to other species. \n \n For instance, a cousin of the ground finch, the mangrove finch, has already become one of the rarest birds on Earth due to the flies and other predators. If any species is lost, it will be a disaster not just for biodiversity, but for researchers who see the finches as an example of real-time evolution due to their rapid adaptations. \n \n Since the Gal\u00e1pagos so far has its entire native population of birds intact, its importance to biologists is unparalleled. But for Clayton, it goes further than that. \u201cIf Darwin\u2019s finches go extinct, it will be because people brought this fly to the islands,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the fly had gotten to the island more gradually, perhaps, maybe the birds would have had more time to adapt. But at this point, it\u2019s just an arms race.\u201d \n \n Luckily, there are ways that the finches could beat both P. downsi and time. The team estimates that if nest fly infestations were reduced by just 40 percent, the birds won\u2019t go extinct. Scientists are batting around ideas such as flooding the island with sterile male flies or allowing birds to fumigate their own nests with permethrin. \n \n And don\u2019t underestimate evolution, either: Clayton says there\u2019s an outside chance the finches could still develop their own defenses against the flies. In the meantime, can humans stave off the finches\u2019 untimely demise? \u201cMaybe not. But we\u2019re hopeful.\u201d ||||| An even more compelling mystery concerns a common sight in springtime\u2014bright blue eggs in a robin\u2019s nest. To human eyes, they are beautifully unmistakable. They stand out from both the nest and the parent birds, so why are they bright blue? No one yet knows for sure. Biologists do know that pigment glands in the mother bird\u2019s body deposit the blue coloration onto the eggs, so it must have a critical function. Perhaps the dark color camouflages the eggs when the eggs are at the bottom of a dark nest, or the blue might blend in with the sky for some viewers. Some researchers have even speculated that the striking color helps mother birds to find their own eggs. For now, however, the case of the mysteriously blue robin\u2019s egg has yet to be cracked. \n \n This Adelie penguin laid a speckled egg that matches its environment. The matching phenomenon could lead to a twist to the old riddle: Which came first, the chicken or the egg? In this case, the teaser could be: Which came first, the egg color and pattern, or the choice of nesting site? \n \n By itself, the egg of a swan is just as visible as a bright white egg on a breakfast plate. Under the mother swan, however, the egg disappears. \n \n This cockatiel, with its proud expression, has a right to boast. Its egg not only matches the mother bird\u2019s coloration, but it also matches the environment. In the wild, a hunter would have a hard time finding such an egg. \n \n A mother cowbird must have worked hard to find this perfect spot for her eggs. \u201cInterestingly, all birds seem more concerned in minimizing the mismatch between nest and the darker speckles on their eggs than the mismatch between nest and the underlying, predominant egg color, but particularly so for birds with more dark speckling,\u201d Cuthill said. Lovell and his team speculate that the dark and light markings serve as a disruptive camouflage, breaking up the outline of the otherwise revealing oval shape. That shape, for humans and countless other predators, serves as a visual signal for good eats. \n \n Sometimes avian parents enjoy the best of both worlds: camouflage for their eggs as well as fooling other birds. Cuckoo finches can be deadbeat parents, matching their eggs (seen in the inner circle) to those of the tawny-flanked prinia (outer circle). The prinia parents are sometimes fooled into caring for the cuckoo finch eggs and later hatchlings. \n \n Brown with speckles is just one egg color/pattern combo, as these reed warbler eggs reveal. Their greenish hue, set off by the green leaves surrounding the nest, would make them less visible to predators scanning the area from a distance. This nest also includes a, slightly larger, common cuckoo egg. Demonstrating another bit of bird trickery, common cuckoo mothers frequently match the appearance of their eggs to those of reed warblers, which wind up caring for the hatchlings. \n \n Japanese quail themselves are brown and speckled, like their eggs. The bodies of many birds appear to match their eggs. A parent bird could then likely better shield the egg when resting upon it. Speckles appear to be key to camouflage, at least for eggs. Avian expert Innes Cuthill of the University of Bristol\u2019s School of Biological Sciences, told Discovery News, \u201cAlfred Russel Wallace concluded that the brown and speckled colors of many eggs had evolved as camouflage against nest predators and that the ancestral color of white only persisted in species whose eggs were laid in well-protected cavities, were covered by nest material or, in birds such as ostriches, could be defended by their parents.\u201d \n \n Yet another Japanese quail egg matches its environment, but the egg is not invisible to us. \u201cSome have asked why they can still see the eggs if they are camouflaged,\u201d Lovell said. \u201cIt\u2019s important to remember that the eggs are less visible, not invisible\u2026The photographs are taken quite close up to the egg, and a predator wouldn\u2019t necessarily be that close. It would be scanning an area, rather than staring straight at the egg.\u201d \n \n Close-ups of the individual Japanese quail eggs really show how well the bird moms can match their eggs to the environment. One of the first scientists to theorize that coloration and speckles evolved for camouflage against predators was Alfred Russel Wallace, who gained fame as Charles Darwin\u2019s co-discoverer of the principle of natural selection. \n \n Eggs come in a multitude of colors and patterns, from subtle pastels to vivid bright hues. Now a new study, published in Current Biology, supports a centuries-old theory that shell variation, at least for some birds, helps to camouflage eggs. The masters of egg disguise turn out to be Japanese quail. This photo amazingly features eggs just from this one species. Mother quails somehow learn the patterning of their own eggs and choose laying spots to hide them best. \u201cWe currently do not know the mechanisms by which the (mother) bird learns its own egg patterns,\u201d lead author P. George Lovell of Abertay University and the University of St. Andrews, told Discovery News. Nevertheless, the ground-nesting birds often perfectly match the eggs to substrate, helping to prevent the precious contents from being some hungry predator\u2019s dinner. \n \n A species of Darwin\u2019s finch could face extinction in as little as four decades because of a parasitic fly, new mathematical models show. \n \n In a study that will be published December 18 in the Journal of Applied Ecology, University of Utah researchers forecast turbulent flying ahead for the medium ground finch (Geospiza fortis), one of the most common of the dozen-plus species of Darwin's finch. (They're named for the man who first collected them, naturalist Charles Darwin, who used observations of the finches' adaptations to inform his work on natural selection. They're also known as Galapagos finches, for the islands they call home.) \n \n The fly in question is the nest fly Philornis downsi, first documented in birds\u2019 nests in the Galapagos in 1997. It lays its eggs in finches' nests, the larvae infesting the area and feeding, to a fatal degree, on new nestlings. \n \n Eggs Say \u2018Hey Mom We Match\u2019: Photos \n \n This medium ground finch has nostril and abdomen lesions caused by a nest infested with parasitic fly larvae. Jennifer Koop, University of Utah \n \n The researchers gathered five years\u2019 worth of data from the island of Santa Cruz, documenting the harm the fly was causing to the finch\u2019s reproductive success. Then they used those results to help fuel mathematical models of different long-term outcomes for the finch species. \n \n The team ran simulations based around three broad future scenarios: \u201cgood\u201d years likely to come, where conditions such as weather and food supply were conducive to successful breeding; \u201cbad\u201d years ahead; and neutral years, where both bad and good conditions were equally likely. \n \n Two of the three model runs -- \"bad\" and neutral -- predicted the medium ground finch's extinction. Only the \"good\" model showed the species able to survive. \n \n The \"bad\" model predicted extinction in anywhere from 43 to 57 years, while the \"neutral\" model had the bird disappearing in 65 to 95 years. \n \n Video Shows Birds Having An Argument \n \n Worse still, the problem may not just apply to the medium ground finch. Study lead author Dale Clayton, a University of Utah biology professor, pointed out that the bird's other Galapagos cousins could be at risk as well. \n \n If a species of Darwin's finch as common as the medium ground finch can face extinction because of the nest fly, \"then the less common species, which have the same fly problem, are likely at risk as well,\" Clayton said in a release. \n \n Pretty Plumage Sets These Shimmering Birds Apart: Photos \n \n Glum scenarios aside, there is still hope. The bird's extinction risk is closely tied to the fly infestation problem, so there's no mystery, and the scientists have a clear target. \n \n \u201cEven though these guys may be going locally extinct, the model also shows that if you can reduce the probability of infestation, then you significantly alleviate the risk of extinction,\u201d said study co-author Jennifer Koop, a professor of biology now teaching at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. She said extinction could be avoided if nest infestation could be reduced by 40 percent. \n \n World's Oldest Known Bird: Photos \n \n To tackle the problem, the scientists suggested several tactics to fight the fly and rescue the finch. Use of insecticides, introduction of fly-parasitizing wasps, breeding of sterile male nest flies to suppress egg production, and even the hand-rearing of at-risk chicks could each help improve matters, the scientists said. \n \n Other good outcomes might come from the birds themselves. Clayton said a \u201crapid evolutionary response\u201d by the birds could spur their immune systems to figure out how to defeat the fly. \n \n \u201cThat happens in other animals,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is: Will these finches have enough time to develop effective defenses before they are driven to extinction by the fly? It\u2019s an arms race.\u201d",

The medium ground finches of Santa Cruz Island are having their newly hatched babies decimated by Philornis downsi, a parasitic nest fly humans brought to the islands half a century ago. The flies lay their eggs inside the birds' nests, and the hatching maggots feed on the young birds. \"This is like a really bad horror flick,\" study author Dale Clayton says. \"The babies can't withstand even one night with these parasites.\" According to Discovery News, the flies were first spotted in the finches' nests in 1997. Since then, the population has been growing, and none of the Galapagos Islands is free of the flies. Researchers looked at five years of field research on the medium ground finches specifically on Santa Cruz and came up with three scenarios\u2014good, bad, and neutral\u2014based on breeding, weather, and food supplies, Discovery News reports. In both the bad and neutral scenarios, the finches have less than 100 years before they're extinct. According to Smithsonian, the same fate is likely facing some of the other 14 species of Darwin's finches. \"If Darwin's finches go extinct, it will be because people brought this fly to the islands,\" Clayton says. \"If the fly had gotten to the island more gradually, perhaps, maybe the birds would have had more time to adapt.\" Researchers believe a 40% reduction of nest infestations could save the finches and are looking at options to accomplish that, Discovery News reports.

Relatives had last spoken to DiFrancesco on Feb. 12. A visiting nurse found the woman dead in her bathroom Feb. 15, when the nurse entered DiFrancesco's home after unsuccessful attempts to summon her by knocking on the door. It is unclear when DiFrancesco died. Her death was ruled an accident, Fox 43 reports. The device (similar to the ones popularized by \"I've fallen and I can't get up\" commercials) did not have a breakaway lanyard, as some do, per the Patriot-News. The FDA has warned of potential choking with such devices, which typically include a pendant with a button to call for help, saying the agency is aware of at least six serious injuries or deaths related to their use between 1998 and 2009. \"Risks are greater for those with mobility limitations or for those who use wheelchairs, walkers, beds with guard rails, or other objects that could entangle with a neck cord,\" the FDA says in a press release. DiFrancesco, who was retired, had worked for 25 years for the federal government and 18 years for the state, according to an obituary. (A freak accident claimed the life of a pregnant woman in Oregon this week.)",

    "document": "The small town of Ku\u015fk\u00f6y, which is tucked into an isolated valley on the rainy, mountainous Black Sea coast of Turkey, looks much like the other villages in the region. Houses balance on steep hillsides beside tea fields and hazelnut orchards. A narrow white minaret and a small domed mosque stand beside a noisy creek. Ku\u015fk\u00f6y is remarkable not for how it looks but for how it sounds: here, the roar of the water and the daily calls to prayer are often accompanied by loud, lilting whistles\u2014the distinctive tones of the local language. Over the past half-century, linguists and reporters curious about what locals call ku__\u015f dili, or \u201cbird language,\u201d have occasionally struggled up the footpaths and dirt roads that lead to Ku\u015fk\u00f6y. So its thousand or so residents were not all that surprised when, a few years ago, a Turkish-born German biopsychologist named Onur G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn showed up and asked them to participate in a study. \n \n Photograph courtesy Onur G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn \n \n Whistled languages, although unusual, have been around for centuries. Herodotus described communities in Ethiopia whose residents \u201cspoke like bats,\u201d and reports of the whistled language that is still used in the Canary Islands date back more than six hundred years. Most of the forty-two examples that have been documented in recent times arose in places with steep terrain or dense forests\u2014the Atlas Mountains, in northwestern Africa; the highlands of northern Laos, the Brazilian Amazon\u2014where it might otherwise be hard to communicate at a distance. All are based on spoken languages: Ku\u015fk\u00f6y\u2019s version, for example, adapts standard Turkish syllables into piercing tones that can be heard from more than half a mile away. The phrase \u201cDo you have fresh bread?,\u201d which in Turkish is \u201cTaze ekmek var m\u0131?,\u201d becomes, in bird language, six separate whistles made with the tongue, teeth, and fingers. \n \n For G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn, whistled Turkish was not only a fascinating cultural oddity but also an exciting natural experiment. How, he wondered, does the brain handle a language that renders words as something like music? Although neuroscientists have long understood that brain functions do not divide cleanly between the left and right hemispheres, the left hemisphere appears to play a consistently dominant role in our understanding of language\u2014regardless of whether the language is tonal or atonal, spoken or written, signed with the hands or clicked with the tongue. The right hemisphere, meanwhile, seems to govern our understanding of pitch, melody, and rhythm. In Ku\u015fk\u00f6y, G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn tested this cranial division of labor by recruiting thirty-one volunteers, all fluent in both spoken and whistled Turkish, to listen to pairs of different syllables played simultaneously through headphones, one in each ear. When he gave them spoken Turkish, the participants usually understood the syllable played through the right speaker, suggesting that the left hemisphere was processing the sound. When he switched to whistled Turkish, however, the participants understood both syllables in roughly equal measure, suggesting that both hemispheres played significant roles in the early stages of comprehension. \n \n Although the technique that G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn used, called dichotic listening, isn\u2019t as precise as laboratory techniques for measuring brain activity, his results, published in today\u2019s issue of Current Biology, are tantalizing. \u201cThey tell us that the organization of our brain, in terms of its asymmetrical structure, is not as fixed as we assume,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe way information is given to us appears to change the architecture of our brain in a radical way.\u201d He now wonders whether people whose spoken-language comprehension is damaged by a left-hemisphere stroke could learn to understand a whistled dialect, much as some people with stroke-damaged speech can communicate by singing. \n \n The opportunity to study whistled Turkish, however, is fading. In 1964, a stringer for the Times reported that children in Ku\u015fk\u00f6y were learning to communicate by whistling before they started school, and that both men and women regularly gossiped, argued, and even courted via whistle. Three years later, a team of visiting linguists observed that whistling was widely used in both the village and the surrounding countryside. But G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn found that few, if any, young women had learned the language, and that, although some young men were fluent whistlers, they had learned the skill as teen-agers, more out of pride than any practical need. In recent years, the town has organized a whistling contest to encourage both tourism and cultural preservation, but the bird language is rapidly disappearing from daily life. In a small town filled with nosy neighbors, texting affords a level of privacy that whistling never did. \n \n From time to time, though, whistled Turkish still comes in handy. When the residents of Ku\u015fk\u00f6y call G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn\u2019s university office, they often reach his secretary, who speaks German. When that happens, he says, they know exactly how to make themselves understood: they just whistle. ||||| JavaScript is disabled \n \n You need to enable JavaScript to use SoundCloud",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The rapidly disappearing \"bird language\" that is spoken\u2014or whistled, actually\u2014by about 10,000 residents in the mountains of Turkey is changing the way scientists think about language and the brain. The left hemisphere has always been dominant when interpreting language, be it spoken, written, signed, or even clicked, explains New Scientist. But that changed when German researcher Onur G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn decided to study the whistled version of Turkish. G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn wanted to see if its musicality might require the brain's right hemisphere, which handles frequency, pitch, and melody. His study of 31 whistled Turkish speakers showed the left hemisphere was 75% dominant with spoken Turkish, but the split between hemispheres was even with the whistled language. \"We\u2019ve shown for the first time equal contributions from both hemispheres,\" says G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn, whose study was published in Current Biology. He tells the New Yorker that this suggests our brain structure \"is not as fixed as we assume\" and that the way information is delivered changes it. The language developed because whistles carry further than spoken words, and its messages can be understood across mountains and valleys. (The New Yorker offers an example of a whistle that means, \"Do you have fresh bread?\") It's lucky G\u00fcnt\u00fcrk\u00fcn got his study in when he did, as modern technology is killing off whistled Turkish. \"You can gossip with a mobile phone, but you can't do that with whistling because the whole valley hears,\" he says. (But, how does any of this explain how one man could lose most of his brain and not even notice?)",

    "document": "Researchers ought to be able to duplicate the findings of other scientists\u2019 work, but a new study suggests that many published psychology results can't be recreated. \n \n A huge, collaborative research project attempted to recreate 100 studies that were recently published in major psychology journals, and it found that only 39 of those studies' results could be replicated. That could mean that the studies were wrong in the first place, but researchers say that the findings tell more about the difficulty of designing a reproducible study than the accuracy of the studies themselves. \n \n Studies need to be reproducible so that scientists can confirm their effects. That's why scientists have generally pushed toward reproducing studies \u2014 and not just in psychology. In part, that's to catch scientific fraud, but it's also simply to make scientific findings more trustworthy. In January 2014, the National Institutes of Health announced it would create new initiatives to address these concerns, but there still aren't widely established reproducibility guidelines. The study being published today speaks to why a bigger focus on reproducibility is necessary. \n \n \"The results present an opportunity.\" \n \n \"I don\u2019t see this story as negative or pessimistic,\" Brian Nosek, a University of Virginia researcher and the study's corresponding author, told reporters this week. \"The results present an opportunity, and the project is a demonstration of science demonstrating one of its central qualities: self-correction.\" \n \n That self-correction even extended to the 39 studies that researchers were able to replicate. Of those, 83 percent had smaller effects that were in the initial reports; the drop in effect size was usually around 50 percent. The report is being published today in the journal Science. \n \n Nosek says that there are three reasons studies' results may not have been replicated or may have changed. First, it's possible that the original result identified an effect that wasn't real. Second, it's possible that the researchers failed to detect a real effect in the reproduction. Finally, it's possible that both studies were accurate but that their methodologies differed in slight but meaningful ways. \n \n The scientists attempting to reproduce studies tried to hew closely to the originals; they even worked with the original researchers and published their study designs for feedback from the over 270 people who worked on the reproduction project. That certainly suggests that errors are being made throughout these experiments, which mostly focused on social psychology and cognitive psychology. But for these researchers, the differing results suggests something else: that there\u2019s a problem with the reproduction process. \n \n \"Despite its central importance, there is little known about the reproducibility of research in general,\" Nosek said. \"And there has been a growing concern that reproducibility may be lower than expected or desired.\" \n \n Research is typically focused on new results, not reproduction \n \n One factor encouraging that, Nosek suggests, is researchers' desire for publication. Succeeding in academia means regularly publishing work, and novel results \u2014 rather than reproductions of older results or results that fail to establish a correlation \u2014 are far more likely to make it into prestigious journals. \"If this occurs on a broad scale, then the published literature may be more beautiful than reality,\" Nosek says. \n \n To move toward more repeatable studies, researchers and journals need to shift their interests away from novelty, the current focus. That's part of why the people behind this study \u2014 operating as part of an initiative from the Open Science Collaboration called the Reproducibility Project: Psychology \u2014 worked with the original researchers whose studies they were replicating. It encouraged them to view these experiments as steps forward, not as threats to their work. \n \n E.J. Masicampo, a researcher at Wake Forest University, both conducted one of the reproductions and had one of his own studies reproduced by someone else. \"Mine was a study that did not successfully replicate,\" Masicampo told reporters. His study had looked at whether giving someone a sugary beverage made it easier for them to make mentally challenging decisions while fatigued. \n \n Both Masicampo's study and its replication asked students to decide between apartments of different sizes and distances from a college campus. It turned out that the decision was difficult for students at Florida State, where Masicampo was working, but the question was too easy for students at the University of Virginia, where it was being reproduced. \"What we found, I think, was that the [methodology] that worked at the original location ... didn't quite translate for participants at the replication location,\" Masicampo said. \n \n How exact must a replication be? \n \n The group was trying to be very faithful to the original study, Masicampo said. The fact that doing so resulted in a failed replication, \"highlighted the issue of how exact these replications should be and how much things change going from one place to another.\" Were replication standards to be put in place, these questions might be answered and lead to a clearer view of each finding's accuracy. \n \n The researchers want to underscore that this isn't a failure of science \u2014 it's just science working normally. \"The real challenge here is that we so much want to have clear answers from any individual study, from any program of research, from any report about studies,\" Nosek said. \"But science doesn't provide certainty. At least not immediately.\" \n \n Of course, all that may make you wonder: how reproducible are these findings? \"It's a very good question and I don't envy the group trying it again,\" Nosek said. \"But it does illustrate the precise point of the reproducibility effort: that even this project itself is not a final word, a last word, a definitive word about reproducibility.\" ||||| Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error. \n \n There is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science. \n \n We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects (M r = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects (M r = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results (P < .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams. \n \n CONCLUSION \n \n No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here. \n \n Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that \u201cwe already know this\u201d belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A new study on psychology research is essentially bashing all other psychology studies. The research area has gotten a bad rap recently thanks to retracted research papers, so psychologists set out to discover what was going on.

But when more than 250 scientists tried to re-create 100 studies from three respected psychology journals\u2014working closely with original researchers\u2014the results matched in just 39 cases. Even among those, 83% were found to have smaller effects than first reported, reports the Verge.

    "document": "Buy Photo University of Cincinnati President Santa Ono speaks in the Fifth Third Arena during the 197th Spring Commencement Saturday April 30, 2016. (Photo: Madison Schmidt for The Enquirer)Buy Photo \n \n Santa Ono, president of the University of Cincinnati, astonished a fund-raising audience and his 70,000-plus Twitter followers over the weekend by revealing that, in his youth, he twice tried to kill himself. In a week when UC remembers a student who died by suicide in 2014, Ono said he wanted to send the message that depression is treatable, and sufferers can move on with life. \n \n In an interview with The Enquirer after his revelation, Ono, 53, said he recovered from depression and being suicidal, and he wanted to erase the stigma attached to the mental illnesses. \n \n \"Someone was there for me to help me work my way through that with medication and also seeing a professional to help me through very dark times in my life,\" Ono said. \"There's light at the end of the tunnel. If you have the proper counseling and support, it's really possible for you to move past that and move back into functioning life.\" \n \n A university official said Sunday that in the immediate aftermath of UC student Brogan Dulle\u2019s May 2014 death, Ono was instrumental in finding the resources for UC to provide any student with five free sessions of mental health counseling. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a courageous revelation for him to put it out there,\u201d said Dr. Phil Diller, who oversees the University Health Service in his role as chairman of UC\u2019s department of family and community medicine. \u201cHe\u2019s using his office to really communicate this point: that people who are highly successful in their lives have issues with mental health as well. This is a very courageous thing to do.\u201d \n \n College students are particularly vulnerable to depression and suicide, Diller said. The most recent data shows that 174 Ohioans between 15 and 24 died in 2012 by suicide. More than 100,000 college students nationwide attempted suicide in 2012. \n \n Saturday night, Ono attended an Indian Hill fundraiser for a group called 1N5, named for the statistic that one in five people will suffer from mental illness; the group is focused on helping teenagers. At that event, Ono told about 200 people that, when he was 14, he locked himself in his bedroom and tried to overdose on cold medication and beer. He attempted suicide again in his late 20s. \n \n The Indian Hill event raised more than $115,000, according to organizers. \n \n After the event, Ono took to social media. Ono told his more than 70,000 followers on Twitter about his suicide attempts. He later told The Enquirer: \"Speaking at the event, I reached a couple hundred people and I felt that if I really wanted to break the silence, the right thing to do was to take advantage of the fact that I communicate with a lot of people over Twitter and social media. I wanted to get that message out to a broader audience.\" \n \n Diller said Sunday that Ono\u2019s revelation did not surprise him. More than a year ago, Ono met with Diller and other mental health care providers at UC following Dulle\u2019s death. The 21-year-old UC student went missing May 18, 2014, and a massive search ended eight days later when his body was found in the basement of the building next door to Dulle\u2019s apartment. He had hanged himself. \n \n Dulle\u2019s mother, Beth, of Cincinnati, said of Ono\u2019s statement: \"It's amazing that he was willing to share that to help other people. It's not easy for people to talk about things like that.\" \n \n She said Ono has become a great friend of her family since he helped with the search for her son. She said he has supported their efforts to honor her son with the \u201c8 Days of Greatness\u201d campaign, a movement of kindness and generosity. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing person,\u201d she said. \u201cFor him, such a public person, to come out. I think it has to give a lot of people courage to open a dialogue. It\u2019s hard to ask for help.\u201d \n \n Diller said, at the meeting after Dulle\u2019s death with the mental health care providers, Ono confided about his own suicide attempts and struggle with depression. \u201cYou could tell that (Dulle\u2019s death) really touched him, and he really wanted to do more. It was, 'what can I do to help?' He was very open about trying to see what he could do to make a difference.\u201d \n \n The result, Diller said, was that Ono was instrumental in arranging for University Health Services to provide more mental health services, a key request of the UC student government. Students now can have the five free counseling sessions. If they need more help, Diller said, they can be referred to other resources, and, \u201cwe take all the insurances there.\u201d \n \n Dr. Charles W. Collins, a UC Health physician and executive vice chairman of the UC College of Medicine\u2019s department of psychiatry and behavioral neuroscience, saw the Ono statements pop up Saturday night on Facebook. \n \n \u201cI thought, \u2018Wow, this is an important revelation,\u2019 because he is at the top of his game as a person and as a great individual, and he admits this, which can be quite helpful to people,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIt has a powerful effect because it brings it out of the darkness. So many people have depression and have no one to really discuss it.\u201d \n \n Collins said Ono can counteract the misimpression that people harbor about depression \u201cthat it\u2019s a weakness, and to have such a powerful figure who clearly is not weak talk about something that happened to him and something that he clearly overcame, that can help make people seek treatment earlier.\u201d \n \n Ono said he did research into mental illness during his time at Emory University under his mentor, Earl Lewis, now president of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. They focused on the high suicide rates among Korean students who felt extreme shame in failure. Since then, Ono said, he's been passionate about suicide prevention. \n \n \"Our students really are an inspiration to me,\" he said. \"The millennial students are much more empathetic toward each other. Many of them have seen someone commit suicide. People are much more aware of what's happening, and that's a good thing. It's motivating them to do something about it. That's motivating them to demand adults and leaders within organizations to do something about it.\" \n \n Ono is the son of a noted mathematician who emigrated from Japan after World War II and held research posts in Princeton, New Jersey, and at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Ono, an accomplished cellist as well as a college administrator, became UC president in 2012. \n \n \"For the last 25 years, I've been symptom-free,\" Ono told The Enquirer. \"A big part of the balance in my life is that I have a loving family, and they're there for me even though I have a stressful life.\u201d Speaking about his own dark periods \"will be an encouragement to other people who are going through difficult times.\" \n \n When he was younger, Ono said, he would have been \"petrified\" to tell his story. \"Now I'm speaking from a much stronger station in life, and it's important for me and others to speak about this to encourage legislators to support more programs.\" \n \n Twitter responded warmly to Ono\u2019s revelations. Many people thanked him for speaking out. \n \n \"As a staff member at UC, I'm so thankful you said this. Proud of your leadership and vulnerability. Our students need to see this,\" Alex Fields wrote. \n \n \"Honesty like this from a man who has seen so much success and is loved by so many is incredibly inspiring,\" Mike Hawke wrote. \n \n Resources for mental health services \n \n University of Cincinnati Counseling & Psychological Services: Provides counseling, outreach programs, and related services for UC students and those concerned about their welfare.

Meanwhile, Dulle's mom says Ono has become a family friend. \"It's amazing that he was willing to share that to help other people,\" she says. \"It's not easy for people to talk about things like that.\" Ono says he's now been free of symptoms for 25 years and that although he would've been \"petrified\" to talk about his struggles during his younger years, \"now I'm speaking from a much stronger station in life, and it's important for me and others to speak about this to encourage legislators to support more programs.\" (The suicide rate has jumped for most Americans.)",

The 53-year-old said he had tried to kill himself twice in his youth, but \"someone was there to help me work my way through that with medication and also seeing a professional,\" Ono said. \"There's light at the end of the tunnel.

However, the two maintain robust informal ties, while Washington sells Taiwan arms and is legally bound to regard any threat to the island as a matter of grave concern. \n \n Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have risen since Tsai's election last year, with Beijing cutting off contacts and working to deepen Taiwan's diplomatic isolation.",

In an effort to discourage these travellers, the Palau government halved the number of charter flights from China in 2015. \n \n The move appeared to pay off. \u201cWhile the numbers went down, the actual tourist spending went up,\u201d said Remengesau. \u201cIt confirms our direction [to attract] less tourists who spend more which equates to more tax dollars.

Negotiations over the surrender of one of Moammar Gadhafi's remaining... (Associated Press) \n \n Moammar Gadhafi is determined to fight his way back to power, the toppled dictator's spokesman said Tuesday, but a large convoy of his soldiers has apparently deserted, crossing the Libyan desert into neighboring Niger. \n \n Also Tuesday, tribal elders in a Gadhafi stronghold were trying to persuade regime loyalists holed up inside to lay down their arms, a rebel negotiator said. \n \n Still, Gadhafi spokesman Moussa Ibrahim was defiant. \n \n Gadhafi is \"in excellent health, planning and organizing for the defense of Libya,\" Ibrahim told the Syrian TV station al-Rai, adding that both Gadhafi and his sons remain in Libya. \n \n \"We are fighting and resisting for the sake of Libya and all Arabs,\" Ibrahim said. \"We are still strong and capable of turning the tables on NATO.\" \n \n Gadhafi loyalists have been holed up in several towns, including Bani Walid, some 90 miles (140 kilometers) southeast of Tripoli. Thousands of rebel fighters have surrounded the town, as rebel leaders tried to negotiate a surrender deal. \n \n Rebel negotiator Abdullah Kanshil said Tuesday that tribal elders want assurances that the rebels will not take revenge, and are trying to persuade Gadhafi loyalists to lay down their arms. \n \n A member of the rebel transitional council said by telephone Tuesday he was in a village near Bani Walid called al-Manasser that had just raised the rebel flag. \n \n \"We want the rest of the tribes to do like al-Manasser to avoid bloodshed and to realize that the regime is over and it will not come back,\" said Mubarak Sabah, who is from Bani Walid and represents the town on the transitional council. \"They should realize that their brothers around the country are enjoying freedom and that they can follow them.\" \n \n Sabah reiterated that rebel fighters would not move into Bani Walid before Saturday unless the town surrendered, so as to avoid \"a bloody war\" with what he said was a minority of Gadhafi supporters in the town. \n \n Across the desert late Monday, a large convoy of Gadhafi loyalists rolled into the frontier town of Agadez, Niger, said Abdoulaye Harouna, the owner of the local newspaper. The convoy consisted of more than a dozen pickup trucks bristling with well-armed Libyan troops, said Harouna, who saw the arrival. \n \n At the head of the convoy, he said, was Tuareg rebel leader Rissa ag Boula, a native of Niger who led a failed war of independence on behalf of ethnic Tuareg nomads a decade ago. He then sought refuge in Libya and was believed to be fighting on behalf of Gadhafi. \n \n It was not immediately clear if the convoy included any members of the Gadhafi family or other high-level members of his regime. \n \n Gadhafi's regime is believed to have financed the Tuareg rebellion in the north of Niger. African nations where Tuaregs represent a significant slice of the population, like Niger, have been among the last to recognize the rebels that ousted Gadhafi. \n \n Gadhafi remains especially popular in towns like Agadez, where a majority of the population is Tuareg. The Sahara Desert market town is the largest city in northern Niger. \n \n Harouna says the pro-Gadhafi soldiers accompanying Boula were coming from the direction of Arlit. \n \n The desert that stretches north of Arlit borders both Libya and Algeria. Some members of Gadhafi's family, including his wife, his daughter Aisha and two of his sons, recently sought refuge in Algeria. \n \n A rebel spokesman for Tripoli's military council said the rebel leadership was aware of the convoy but had few details. \n \n \"It was not a large number of soldiers. We think it was a protection team of some sort,\" Anis Sharif said. \n \n A NATO official in Brussels said the alliance did not have any immediate information about the convoy. \n \n NATO warplanes don't normally patrol that deep south in the Sahara, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with standing alliance policy. \n \n NATO reported bombing several sites overnight near Gadhafi's Mediterranean hometown of Sirte, a region NATO has targeted heavily every day in recent days. \n \n Gadhafi's whereabouts are unknown, but speculation has centered on Sirte and the other loyalist holdouts of Sabha in the far south and Bani Walid. \n \n The rebels hold most of Libya and have sketched out plans for a transition to democratic rule that would begin with a \"declaration of liberation\" that was likely to come before Gadhafi's strongholds are defeated and he is captured. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Dalatou Mamane in Niamey, Niger; Slobodan Lekic in Brussels and Karin Laub in Tripoli contributed to this report.",

    "document": "MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 A species of snake that had been \"lost\" for almost 80 years has been re-discovered on a remote Mexican island. \n \n According to a study published in the PLOS ONE scientific journal, the Clarion nightsnake was found again on one of the Revillagigedo Islands, more than 400 miles (650 kilometers) off Mexico's Pacific coast. \n \n The original, and until recently the only, spotting of the species was made by American naturalist William Beebe in a 1936 visit to Clarion, one of the four Revillagigedo Islands. He returned with one snake preserved in a glass jar. \n \n Subsequent visits failed to find more nightsnakes, and no further sightings were reported over the years from the island, which is inhabited only by a small detachment of Mexican marines. The existing dead sample was assumed to be a labelling error and the snake was largely struck from taxonomic registries. \n \n But Daniel Mulcahy, a researcher for the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, suspected it might still exist. He and Juan Martinez Gomez of Mexico's Ecology Institute set out to find it. \n \n Martinez Gomez, an expert on the Revillagigedo Islands, noted the islands change a lot from season to season, so they timed the expedition last May to replicate Beebe's steps as they looked for the snake, which blends in with the island's rock formations and is largely active at night. And they used Beebe's original field notes as a guide. \n \n \"Basically, following those directions, we essentially put ourselves in his place,\" Martinez Gomez said. \n \n One of his graduate students, Juan Alberto Cervantes, was the first to spot one of the snakes for the first time since 1936. \n \n The researchers performed DNA analysis to establish the long, dark spotted snake as its own species and see where it had come from. The tests showed it is most closely related to snakes from Mexico's Sonora-Sinaloa coast more than 500 miles (800 kilometers) away. Martinez Gomez said the snake's ancestors may have made the trip from the mainland on a tree trunk felled by a storm and washed out to sea. \n \n The National Museum of Natural History said Mulcahy \"uncovered the controversy surrounding the inclusion of this snake in the scientific record, and found that it appears to be the only species ever to be discarded due to a presumed locality error.\" \n \n Patricia Escalante, a biologist who curates bird collections at Mexico's National Autonomous University and who was not involved in the snake project, said the re-discovery of the Clarion nightsnake was \"very interesting\" and significant because of the fragility of island ecosystems. \n \n One inhabitant of the Revillagigedo Islands, the Socorro dove, went extinct in its natural habitat sometime in the 1970s. But live specimens had been taken off the islands in the 1920s, and their descendants were recently re-introduced to the islands. ||||| Image copyright Daniel Mulcahy Image caption The Clarion Nightsnake has a distinctive pattern of spots Photo: Daniel Mulcahy \n \n A lost species of snake that eluded scientists for nearly 80 years has been rediscovered in Mexico, a US museum says. \n \n The Clarion Nightsnake was found on the Pacific island of Clarion in Mexico by a researcher from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. \n \n The snake was first discovered in 1936 by naturalist William Beebe. \n \n Although never declared extinct, it was struck from the record after scientists were unable to rediscover it. \n \n The museum said that researcher Daniel Mulcahy, working with an expert from a Mexican institute, carried out an expedition to Clarion Island where their team identified 11 snakes matching Beebe's description. \n \n DNA tests confirmed that the Clarion Nightsnake was indeed genetically distinct from others found in mainland Mexico. \n \n The museum said the snake species is found exclusively on the island and could have remained unknown to science if not for the team's efforts. It is now recognised as a full species. \n \n \"The rediscovery of the Clarion Nightsnake is an incredible story of how scientists rely on historical data and museum collections to solve modern-day mysteries about biodiversity in the world we live in,\" Mr Mulcahy said in a museum statement. \n \n \"Proper identification is the first step toward conserving this snake, and we plan to continue monitoring this species to learn more about the role it plays in the delicate Clarion Island ecosystem.\"",

Saxby Chambliss (R-GA) speaks to members of the media after a hearing in November 2012. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) \n \n Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), one of the Republicans most vulnerable to a conservative primary challenge, will retire in 2014 rather than seek a third term. \n \n Chambliss denied in a statement Friday morning that the potential primary was a factor in his decision, saying he was confident he would have won re-election. \n \n \u201cInstead, this is about frustration, both at a lack of leadership from the White House and at the dearth of meaningful action from Congress, especially on issues that are the foundation of our nation\u2019s economic health,\" Chambliss said. \"The debt-ceiling debacle of 2011 and the recent fiscal-cliff vote showed Congress at its worst and, sadly, I don\u2019t see the legislative gridlock and partisan posturing improving anytime soon.\" \n \n The news of Chambliss's retirement was first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \n \n Two Republican House members, Paul Broun and Tom Price, were considering campaigns against Chambliss. Former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel was also interested in the race. \n \n Despite his largely conservative record, Chambliss has attracted conservative ire for his interest in bipartisan compromise. His recent public break with anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist earned him particular scrutiny. He also struggled in the 2008 election, forced into a runoff with Democrat Jim Martin. \n \n Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), another senator vulnerable to a primary challenge, responded with \"great sadness and disappointment\" to the news of his friend's retirement. \n \n Given how many big names were already interested in the seat, there will almost certainly be a crowded primary. Polling suggests former presidential candidate Herman Cain would be a strong contender, but he said again Friday that he is not running. \n \n Democrats are also expressing interest. \n \n \u201cGeorgia will now offer Democrats one of our best pick-up opportunities of the cycle,\" said Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Executive Director Guy Cecil, noting changing demographics and a potentially divisive GOP primary. \"This will be a top priority.\u201d Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed is considered a top Democratic prospect, along with Rep. John Barrow. ||||| Georgia Senator Saxby Chambliss is theoretically very vulnerable to a primary challenger in 2014: it's just a question of whether any of the folks interested in taking him on can run a strong enough campaign to take advantage of that vulnerability. \n \n Only 38% of Republican primary voters say they want Chambliss to be their nominee next year, compared to 43% who would prefer someone more conservative. But Chambliss stomps most of the people who've shown the most interest in taking him on. He leads Congressman Paul Broun by a 57/14 margin in a head to head, has a 50/22 advantage over Congressman Tom Price, and leads former Secretary of State Karen Handel 52/23. \n \n By far and away the Republican who would pose the greatest threat to Chambliss in a primary, if he changed his mind about running, is Herman Cain. Cain would lead Chambliss 50-36 in a hypothetical match up. Cain has a 68/20 favorability rating with GOP primary voters, which compares quite favorably to Chambliss' 45/36 approval spread. Other long shot candidates we tested against Chambliss were Allen West, who trails 47/26, and Erick Erickson who trails 51/22. \n \n Chambliss is extremely weak with Republicans describing themselves as 'very conservative.' 61% of them would like to replace him, compared to only 23% who would like to see him nominated again. He would trail Cain 68/19 with that group of voters. \n \n In terms of the general election the Georgia Senate race is somewhat reminiscent of the Indiana contest this cycle- if Chambliss is the nominee the seat is probably safe for the GOP, but if someone far to his right wins the primary the Democrats might have a chance if everything goes their way.",

(Associated Press) \n \n Beji Caid-Essebsi will replace Mohammed Ghannouchi, who resigned earlier Sunday after becoming a major irritant to Tunisians behind the so-called \"Jasmine Revolution\" that toppled autocratic President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali last month and sparked a wave of upheaval in the Arab world. \n \n The caretaker president, Fouad Mebazaa, made the appointment later Sunday. \n \n As Ben Ali's prime minister for 11 years, Ghannouchi became the emblem of an entrenched old guard that many Tunisians feared were hijacking their revolution. \n \n It was not immediately clear how much the shake-up would mollify the protesters in Tunisia, at a time when its leaders are attempting to rebuild its tourism industry and cope with an influx of Tunisians and others fleeing from violence in neighboring Libya. \n \n The change in the government's leadership follows renewed street protests. Officials said that at least five people have died in violent street protests since Friday. \n \n Ghannouchi had previously vowed to stay on to guide Tunisia until elections could be organized this summer. \n \n As he stepped down, Ghannouchi sought to take the high ground. \n \n \"This (resignation) is not a flight from my responsibilities, but to open the way for another prime minister who _ I hope _ will have more margin for action than I have had, to give hope to the Tunisian people,\" he said. \n \n \"I am not ready to be the man of repression, and I will never be,\" Ghannouchi said, warning that unspecified forces appeared to be swelling to try to quash the move toward democracy. \n \n Caid-Essebsi is an elderly statesman and lawyer who served in government posts under the Tunisia's two longtime leaders since it gained independence from France in 1956: Habib Bourguiba and Ben Ali. \n \n Ben Ali was driven from power on Jan. 14 and fled to Saudi Arabia following weeks of a deadly popular uprising that has fanned similar upheaval across the Arab world. \n \n Some Tunisians believe that Ben Ali loyalists in the country have sought to sow discord and discredit the movement that brought the former authoritarian leader down. \n \n \"There needs to be reconciliation among all Tunisians to show the world that Tunisia is a civilized country,\" Ghannouchi said. \"My resignation will help create this new atmosphere.\" \n \n The Interior Ministry, in a statement Saturday, blamed \"provocateurs\" for fomenting violence in otherwise peaceful rallies and for allegedly using young people as human shields in renewed demonstrations. \n \n On Saturday, police and troops backed by tanks used tear gas to disperse hundreds of youths protesting against the caretaker government. Officers were seen chasing some youths through town after the rally ended. \n \n Authorities then ordered a temporarily ban on vehicle and pedestrian traffic on the capital's central Bourguiba Avenue until midnight Sunday _ the first of its kind since Ben Ali's downfall. \n \n On Friday, police fired tear gas and warning shots as violence erupted alongside a sit-in that drew tens of thousands of protesters near the seat of the interim government. \n \n Officials said nearly 200 people were arrested over the last two days.",

    "document": "Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn and a hotel maid who accused him of trying to rape her have reached an agreement to settle her lawsuit, likely ending a legal saga that forced the onetime French presidential contender's resignation and opened a floodgate of accusations against him, a person familiar with the case said Thursday. \n \n Details of the deal, which comes after prosecutors dropped related criminal charges last year, weren't immediately known and likely will be veiled by a confidentiality agreement. That could prevent the two from speaking publicly about a May 2011 encounter that she called a brutally sudden attack and he termed a consensual \"moral failing.\" \n \n Lawyers for Strauss-Kahn and the housekeeper, Nafissatou Diallo, made the as-yet-unsigned agreement within recent days, with Bronx Supreme Court Justice Douglas McKeon facilitating that and a separate agreement to end another lawsuit Diallo filed against the New York Post, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private agreement. A court date is expected next week, though the day wasn't set, the person said. \n \n Strauss-Kahn lawyer William W. Taylor III declined to comment. Lawyers for the housekeeper didn't immediately respond to phone and email messages. \n \n Diallo, 33, and Strauss-Kahn, 63, crossed paths when she arrived to clean his luxury Manhattan hotel suite. She told police he chased her down, tried to yank down her pantyhose and forced her to perform oral sex. \n \n The allegation seemed to let loose a spiral of accusations about the sexual conduct of Strauss-Kahn, a married diplomat and economist who had long been dubbed the \"great seducer.\" He now faces charges linking him to a suspected prostitution ring in his home country. \n \n With DNA evidence showing a sexual encounter and Diallo providing a gripping description of an attack, the Manhattan district attorney's office initially said it had a strong and compelling case. But within six weeks, prosecutors' confidence began to ebb as they said Diallo had lied about her past _ including a false account of a previous rape _ and her actions after leaving Strauss-Kahn's room. \n \n Diallo, who's from Guinea, said she told the truth about their encounter. But the district attorney's office dropped the charges in August 2011, saying prosecutors could no longer ask a jury to believe her. \n \n Diallo had sued Strauss-Kahn in the meantime, with her lawyers saying she would get her day in a different court. Strauss-Kahn called the lawsuit defamatory and countersued her for $1 million. \n \n Her lawsuit against the Post concerned a series of articles that called her a prostitute and said she sold sex at a hotel where the Manhattan DA's office had housed her during the criminal case. The News Corp. newspaper has said it stands by its reporting; a spokeswoman declined to comment Thursday. \n \n In helping resolve the cases, McKeon averted what could have been an ugly court drama. \n \n Strauss-Kahn initially said he had diplomatic immunity, an argument the judge turned down in May. Strauss-Kahn's lawyers had since asked McKeon to throw out part of her claim for other legal reasons. Court records show the judge had yet to rule on that and several other legal issues, and it appeared that a high-stakes step _ depositions, or pretrial questioning under oath _ had not yet been taken. Depositions can give both sides information and a better picture of how strong the key parties and other witnesses might be in court. \n \n While the vast majority of civil cases end in settlements, some legal observers were surprised that the deal between Strauss-Kahn and Diallo came before the legal arguments were resolved. \n \n \"I really expected it to go a little farther,\" said Matthew Galluzzo, a criminal defense lawyer and civil litigator who has been following the Strauss-Kahn case closely. \n \n Still, the case likely had taken a toll on both Diallo, a single mother of a teenage daughter, and Strauss-Kahn, who has found himself plagued by accusations of sexual misconduct that further tarnished his reputation. The Socialist had been seen as a potential leading candidate for the French presidency before his New York arrest. \n \n In France, judges are to decide by Dec. 19 whether to annul charges linking him to a suspected prostitution ring run out of a luxury hotel in Lille. He acknowledges attending \"libertine\" gatherings but denies knowing that some women present were paid. \n \n In August, a separate case against Strauss-Kahn, centered on allegations of rape in a Washington, D.C., hotel, was dropped after French prosecutors said the accuser, an escort, changed her account to say she wasn't raped. \n \n Soon after Strauss-Kahn's arrest in New York last year, French writer Tristane Banon accused him of attempting to rape her during an interview in 2003, a claim he called imaginary and slanderous. Prosecutors said they believed the encounter qualified as a sexual assault, but the legal timeframe to pursue her complaint had elapsed. \n \n Strauss-Kahn has separated from his wife, journalist and heiress Anne Sinclair, who stood by him through the allegations in New York. The two said they were filing a lawsuit this summer against a French magazine, citing invasion of privacy, for reporting they had split, but Sinclair later acknowledged it was true. \n \n The New York Times first reported the agreement between Strauss-Kahn and Diallo. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press Writer Colleen Long contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Jennifer Peltz at http://twitter.com/jennpeltz ||||| Dominique Strauss-Kahn and the hotel housekeeper who accused him of sexually assaulting her last year have quietly reached an agreement to settle a lawsuit she brought against him stemming from the case, which made international headlines, people with knowledge of the matter said Thursday. \n \n French media reported on Friday that Mr. Straus-Kahn, 63, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, would pay $6 million to the housekeeper, Nafissatou Diallo, who accused him of attacking her at a Midtown Manhattan hotel. \n \n Mr. Strauss-Kahn\u2019s lawyer, William W. Taylor III, said in a telephone interview on Friday morning that the French reports were \u201ccompletely false\u201d and that the $6 million figure \u201cis off by orders of magnitude,\u201d but he would not elaborate and details of the agreement could not immediately be determined. One of the people with knowledge of the matter had cautioned on Thursday that no settlement had yet been signed. \n \n Ms. Diallo\u2019s lawyer, Kenneth P. Thompson, declined to comment on Friday morning. \n \n Photo \n \n The parties are scheduled to appear next week before Justice Douglas E. McKeon in State Supreme Court in the Bronx, the people said. \n \n Mr. Strauss-Kahn, once a leading candidate for the French presidency, was arrested in May 2011 after Ms. Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea, told the police that he had sexually assaulted her when she came to clean his 28th-floor suite at the Sofitel hotel. Several days later, a grand jury indicted Mr. Strauss-Kahn on charges including attempted rape, sexual abuse, criminal sexual act, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. \n \n He resigned his I.M.F. post in disgrace. \n \n But the case fell apart in the weeks after the indictment, as prosecutors began to have concerns about the housekeeper\u2019s credibility. \n \n Photo \n \n In August 2011, the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., moved to dismiss the seven-count indictment, and a judge dropped the charges. By then, her lawyers had already filed the civil case in the Bronx, where she lives. Mr. Strauss-Kahn later filed a countersuit, saying the housekeeper\u2019s statements had damaged his political career. \n \n Ms. Diallo\u2019s lawsuit sought unspecified damages for what court papers called a \u201cviolent and sadistic attack\u201d that humiliated and degraded her, and robbed her \u201cof her dignity as a woman.\u201d Her lawyer indicated that he was prepared to introduce testimony from other women who say they were attacked by Mr. Strauss-Kahn in \u201chotel rooms around the world\u201d and in apartments specifically used by him \u201cfor the purpose of covering up his crimes.\u201d \n \n Mr. Strauss-Kahn has said the sex with Ms. Diallo was consensual, though in a French television interview after the charges were dismissed, he acknowledged that the encounter was \u201can error\u201d and \u201ca moral failure\u201d he would regret his whole life. \n \n One person with knowledge of the matter said media reports about the agreement to settle Ms. Diallo\u2019s lawsuit had raised concerns that they would disrupt the sensitive negotiations. \n \n Mr. Strauss-Kahn also has legal troubles in France, where he was charged in Lille in October 2011 with participating in an organized prostitution ring, a result of sex parties that he attended in northern France and at a deluxe hotel in Washington. \n \n Eight other men were also charged. French prosecutors said the ring organized sex parties with mostly Belgian prostitutes in Lille, Paris, Brussels and Washington.",

Authorities are also permitted to stop Thai citizens from leaving the country. \n \n Demonstrators Wednesday had been keeping a promise to intensify protests unless Vejjajiva dissolves parliament. \n \n Explainer: What are the protests about? \n \n The state of emergency was declared a few hours after the protesters stormed into the parliament building and then dispersed to regroup at their main gathering places at Phan Fa Bridge and Rajaprasong Intersection. \n \n Lawmakers who were inside the parliament building as the protesters began arriving made a quick exit, some climbing over fences. \n \n A helicopter was dispatched to pick up Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thuangsuban and some other officials, Abhisit's office said. \n \n iReport: Scene from Wednesday demonstration \n \n The cabinet met to extend the country's Internal Security Act for another two weeks to help maintain order in the capital as the protests show no signs of abating. \n \n The act has been in effect since March 11, two days before the protesters began their mass demonstrations in Bangkok. \n \n On Tuesday, Abhisit spoke on television saying the rallies violated the constitution. \n \n The demonstrators have disregarded all calls to disperse from Bangkok's commercial hub. The nation's tourism minister, Chumpol Silapaarcha, has said the protests could affect tourism by about 10 percent. \n \n The group, United Front for Democracy Against Dictatorship, is made up of supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. \n \n He fled the country in 2008 while facing trial on corruption charges that he says were politically motivated. He remains hugely popular. \n \n The protesters say Abhisit was not democratically elected and have demanded that he call elections. ||||| Unrest in Thailand intruded for the second straight year on a summit of Southeast Asian leaders as the Thai prime minister was forced to abandon his trip at the last minute Thursday amid fears of violence. \n \n One day after declaring a national state of emergency, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva announced he would skip the 16th annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Vietnam to deal with thousands of \"Red Shirt\" anti-government protesters who have paralyzed parts of the Thai capital. \n \n The tensions seized the attention of ASEAN leaders, who pride themselves on keeping one another's political affairs out of the limelight. \n \n \"The situation in Bangkok is worrying, and it's a somber backdrop to our discussions,\" Singaporean Foreign Minister George Yeo said at the summit's opening. \"I really hope that the situation there will not lead to violence.\" \n \n The Thai upheaval even upstaged concerns about Myanmar's upcoming elections, which have been boycotted by the main opposition party because its leader has been forbidden from participating. \n \n Myanmar's junta plans to call elections sometime this year, but under the election laws, detained pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi is forbidden from participating. \n \n Last week, members of her party, the National League for Democracy, announced they would not participate in the polls, the first in 20 years. \n \n \"It's disappointing that, because of the way the election laws have been crafted, it's not possible for the NLD to participate in the elections,\" Yeo said, speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the meeting Thursday morning. \n \n However, he said, it was unlikely that the group would strongly criticize Myanmar's junta. \n \n \"We are not in a position to punish Myanmar,\" Yeo said. \"If China and India remain engaged with Myanmar, then we have to.\" \n \n Leaders from the 10 ASEAN nations had planned to focus on economics, where member countries with widely diverging political systems _ ranging from democracies to communism to a military junta _ share more common ground. \n \n ASEAN hopes to advance its goals of forming a European-style economic community by 2015 and promoting development across the region. \n \n Last year's summit was hijacked by the same protesters, forcing some visiting leaders to be airlifted out by helicopter. The Red Shirts, who briefly raided Parliament on Wednesday, are calling for Abhisit to dissolve Parliament within 15 days and call new elections. Instead, the prime minister has offered to do so by the end of the year. The Red Shirts claim he took office illegitimately in December 2008 with the help of military pressure on parliament. \n \n The confrontation is part of the long-running battle between partisans of former leader Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted by a 2006 military coup, and those who oppose him.

Oklahoma\u2019s execution procedures are under review after the April 29 botched lethal injection of Clayton Lockett, who writhed, groaned and tried to speak. He suffered what corrections director Robert Patton said appeared to be a massive heart attack and died 43 minutes after the execution began. There have been no executions in the US since Lockett's. \n \n Attorneys for Charles Warner, who was to die the same night as Lockett in a rare double execution, are watching the review closely. He was granted a stay of execution after Lockett's death and is now scheduled to die on November 13. \n \n The dispute over the chair predates the current execution crisis. Massie told the McAlester News-Capital on Friday that he stands by the department\u2019s claim to the chair. \n \n \n \n McAlester mayor Steve Harrison told the Guardian that the electric chair should be on display for the public to see. \n \n \u201cI would like to get it displayed somewhere since it is a historical artefact,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it does anybody any good for it to sit in storage somewhere.\u201d \n \n He said the chair, nicknamed Old Sparky, had been in a museum McAlester \u2013 a town of about 18,000 that is home to the state\u2019s death chamber \u2013 until the corrections department took it back. \n \n \u201cThe transfer happened a number of years ago, and I\u2019m not sure anybody has the complete story on who legally owns it,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where it is.\u201d \n \n Harrison said he expects if Oklahoma planned to electrocute an inmate, the state would get a new electric chair. \n \n \u201cThat chair has not been used since 1966,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cMy assumption would be if it ever got to the point the electric chair was needed again they would start with a new one. Can\u2019t imagine they would use one that hasn\u2019t been used in 50 years.\u201d \n \n The chair, first used in 1915, was used to execute 82 inmates before it was retired. The last inmate to sit in it was James French, who was killed on 10 August, 1966, for the murder of his cellmate. \n \n Bill Ervin, of McAlester, whose law firm represents the city, said the chair is \u201cnot much to look at.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s an antique,\u201d Ervin said. \u201cIf that\u2019s the one they\u2019re talking about, I don\u2019t know why they would use that one (in an execution).\u201d \n \n As states grapple with a European-led boycott over lethal injection drugs, some have proposed returning to old methods such as the electric chair and the firing squad. This month, Tennessee\u2019s governor approved the use of the electric chair for executions where drugs could not be acquired. \n \n Some states \u2013 Florida, Alabama and Virginia \u2013 have long listed electrocution as an optional execution method.

    "document": "Photo \n \n After decades of decline, the prevalence of smoking in China has held steady in recent years. Coupled with population growth, this means there are now more smokers in China than ever, according to a new study on global smoking prevalence published this month in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \n \n China gained almost 100 million smokers between 1980 and 2012, despite an overall decrease in smoking prevalence in the same period from 30.4 percent to 24.2 percent. But prevalence has plateaued, remaining nearly unchanged since 2006. Prevalence is defined as the percentage of the population that smokes every day, adjusted for age. \n \n Photo \n \n Using a wide range of sources, including in-country surveys, government statistics and World Health Organization data, researchers also found that China had the highest number of smokers in the world in 2012 with 281 million, about one-third of the world\u2019s smoking population. A report late last year by the state-run broadcaster CCTV put the number of smokers in China around 350 million. \n \n The study, titled \u201cSmoking Prevalence and Cigarette Consumption in 187 Countries, 1980-2012,\u201d was conducted by researchers at the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The paper is among the first to produce a comprehensive global time series on smoking prevalence. \n \n The findings are significant, said Judith Mackay, senior adviser to the World Lung Foundation, because they highlight the \u201cabsolute need for China to awake and really grasp the political nettle of tobacco control.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe study shows that the tobacco epidemic is going to be a whole lot worse before it gets better, particularly in lower income countries,\u201d Dr. Mackay said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf they do nothing at all there are going to be massive costs for China in terms of premature deaths, health care costs, environmental costs, economic costs, family costs \u2014 there are all manners of costs.\u201d \n \n Substantial population growth and unchanging smoking prevalence in populous countries such as China, Bangladesh and Indonesia help explain why since 2006 the global decline in daily tobacco smoking has decelerated. \n \n Photo \n \n The leveling off of smoking prevalence in China and globally can also be attributed in part to varying degrees of addictiveness. \n \n \u201cChange in tobacco prevalence typically has been slow, underscoring what a hard habit it is to break,\u201d said Emmanuela Gakidou, professor of global health and director of education and training at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, in a news release. \n \n The average number of cigarettes consumed daily per smoker in China has increased as well. According to the study, whereas the average smoker consumed about 15 cigarettes a day in 1980, by 2012 that number had risen to 22. \n \n By contrast, four countries \u2014 Canada, Iceland, Mexico and Norway \u2014 reduced their smoking prevalence by more than half in the same period. Globally, the average number of cigarettes consumed per smoker per day declined from about 18 to about 17 in 2012. \n \n The increase in number of smokers in China has taken place in spite of a number of measures enacted by the government in recent years to restrict smoking, which researchers say is among the leading risk factors for death in China. \n \n These efforts have included a ban on smoking in restaurants and other public places as well as a directive issued in December urging Communist Party officials to quit altogether. But with no penalty for noncompliance, these measures are rarely enforced. \n \n But while the overall number of smokers in China has increased, the skewed gender ratio of China\u2019s smoking population has only become more pronounced. Only about 4 percent of smokers in China in 2012 were female, down from about 8 percent in 1980. That greater independence and improved economic conditions have not led to an increase in smoking among Chinese women \u2014 and Asian women more generally \u2014 is \u201cpuzzling,\u201d said Dr. Mackay of the World Lung Foundation, considering that these factors have been associated with a rise in smoking among women in the West. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s been surprising,\u201d said Dr. Mackay. \u201cBut we are very thankful for that surprise.\u201d ||||| Story highlights China moves to ban public indoor smoking by end of 2014 \n \n Half of Chinese men smoke, according to survey \n \n China is largest consumer and producer of tobacco \n \n China, the world's largest tobacco consumer, is aiming to ban indoor smoking in public areas by the end of the year. \n \n About one in three cigarettes smoked in the world is in China, according to the World Health Organization. And more than half of Chinese men smoke, according to the Global Adult Tobacco Survey in 2010. \n \n Although the nation's health ministry issued guidelines in 2011 to ban smoking in places like hotels and restaurants, they haven't been \"strictly enforced,\" according to Xinhua, China's state-run news agency. \n \n The China's National Health and Family Commission is now working on a tobacco control law with clear punishments, according to Xinhua. \n \n The country's health authorities estimate over a million deaths from tobacco-related diseases every year. The WHO warns that if tobacco use is not decreased in China, these deaths will increase to 3 million by 2050. \n \n JUST WATCHED China's smoking habit Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH China's smoking habit 04:28 PLAY VIDEO \n \n Last month, Chinese government officials were told not to smoke in public places such as hospitals, public transport or schools to set a good example for the public. \n \n The latest moves by the Chinese government on tobacco are \"hopeful,\" said Dr. Judith Mackay, the senior adviser at the World Lung Foundation, who examines tobacco issues in China. \n \n About 32 Chinese cities have passed their own rules to restrict public smoking, she added. \n \n \"China stands on its own in the magnitude of the problem,\" said Mackay. \"Unless there is change in China, we won't proceed further in reducing the tobacco epidemic in the world.\" \n \n Tobacco use in China has far-reaching consequences, she said. \n \n \"This isn't a health problem. It's a huge economic problem. There's all these things ranging from medical and health care costs, the costs to the families and there's the cost of secondhand smoke.\"",

But, in the third installment of an interview which Turkey\u2019s Cumhuriyet newspaper has published this week, Mr. Assad showed no readiness to heed either cease-fire calls or a plan proposed by Kofi Annan, the special envoy on Syria, for a transitional government. \n \n The series of excerpts from the interview, conducted last Sunday in Damascus, has provided a rare insight into Mr. Assad\u2019s thinking both on his plight at home and on regional relationships, strained by the action of Syrian gunners who shot down a Turkish warplane over the Mediterranean last month. \n \n Turkey's military said in a statement on Thursday that the bodies of the two pilots, found a day earlier at the bottom of the eastern Mediterranean 8.6 nautical miles from Syria's shoreline, were recovered and sent to the Turkish town of Malatya, home to their air base, where the doomed F-4 Phantom took off on its final mission June 22. A memorial service was planned there for Friday. \n \n The military statement also included photographs of what were described as 31 pieces of their downed plane recovered in the search, which was aided by Robert Ballard, the American undersea explorer and his vessel, the Nautilus, perhaps best known for discovering the remains of the Titanic in 1985. \n \n Turkey says Syria brought down the plane over international waters, but Syria says it was in Syrian airspace at the time. \n \n In discussing the incident with Cumhuriyet, Mr. Assad also ranged over the broader issue of his survival through 16 months of uprising, his determination to put down the revolt and his insistence that he has the support of the bulk of Syrians. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The fight against terrorism will continue decisively in the face of this. And we will defeat terror.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe overwhelming majority of the people think like me on this subject,\u201d he said. \n \n Mr. Assad referred to the shah of Iran, who was overthrown by the Islamic revolution in 1979, but said his own position was different because he has popular support among Syrians. \n \n The shah, he said, \u201cled the most important country in the region, he had a powerful army and was supported by the whole world.

However, he could turn up as a guest on the network, but we haven\u2019t heard of any pending bookings for FNC, CNN or MSNBC. \n \n There\u2019s a reason Fox is quick to distance itself from Bannon, as revealed in Michael Wolff\u2018s Trump tell-all Fire and Fury. Bannon has no love for Rupert Murdoch, executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, and, since the departure of Roger Ailes in 2016, chairman of Fox News Channel. Wolff writes: \n \n Bannon collected enemies. Few fueled his savagery and rancor toward the standard-issue Republican world as much as Rupert Murdoch\u2013not least because Murdoch had Donald Trump\u2019s ear. It was one of the key elements of Bannon\u2019s understanding of Trump: the last person Trump spoke to ended up with enormous influence. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know anything about American politics; and has no feel for the American people,\u201d said Bannon to Trump, always eager to point out that Murdoch wasn\u2019t an American. \n \n Murdoch, born in Australia, has been living in the U.S. since 1973. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1985. \n \n Bannon had been executive chairman of Breitbart since 2012. He left the publication to join the Trump campaign and became the president\u2019s chief strategist. He was fired 6 months into that job and returned to Breitbart. But after his comments to Wolff about the president\u2019s mental fitness, revealed in Fire and Fury, Breitbart began to distance itself from Bannon leading to his resignation Tuesday. \n \n Comments ||||| Over time, Bannon\u2019s influence waned over rising tensions with the president, and his association with controversial figures like former Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, fired after video emerged of comments he made seeming to endorse pedophilia, and Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican who lost a Senate race after being accused of preying on teenage girls. \n \n During Bannon's tenure, Breitbart had become increasingly devoted to promoting him, welcoming him back as a \"populist hero\" after he returned following his ouster from the White House. Bannon left the White House in August 2017, in the aftermath of the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, and after giving an unfettered interview bashing colleagues to the liberal American Prospect. \n \n In a statement on Tuesday, Sirius XM announced that Bannon would no longer host Breitbart's radio show: \"Breitbart News has decided to end its relationship with Stephen K. Bannon, therefore he will no longer host on SiriusXM since our programming agreement is with Breitbart News.\u201d \n \n Bannon\u2019s position leading Breitbart became untenable after the release of Wolff\u2019s book Fire and Fury, an inside-the-White-House tell-all in which Bannon was evidently a key source and which features him making a number of harsh comments about Trump\u2019s family. The most controversial of these was Bannon\u2019s comment to Wolff that Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in 2016, in which Trump Jr. sought damaging information on Trump\u2019s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, was \u201ctreasonous.\u201d Federal investigators are currently trying to determine whether the Trump campaign aided what U.S. intelligence agencies have described as an effort to boost Trump\u2019s candidacy in the 2016 election. \n \n Bannon\u2019s comments enraged Trump, with whom Bannon had occasionally spoken after Bannon was forced out of the White House in August. In a statement last week, Trump said Bannon had \u201clost his mind\u201d and accused him of being a leaker. \n \n Though Bannon\u2019s circle pushed him to release a statement smoothing over the incident last week, Trump\u2019s came out first, making Bannon\u2019s position in Trumpworld clear. Then, in a rare public statement, Bannon\u2019s wealthy conservative patron Rebekah Mercer said she was cutting ties with him and that her family was no longer supporting his political projects. Mercer had been unhappy with Bannon for some time; according to a source with direct knowledge of her comments, Mercer told people over six weeks ago that she was finished with Bannon. \n \n Breitbart\u2019s board, meanwhile, reportedly debated firing Bannon. According to disclosures the company made while trying to obtain congressional press credentials last year, Breitbart is owned by Solov, company founder Andrew Breitbart\u2019s widow Susie, and the Mercer family with a minority stake. ||||| (CNN) Donald Trump made Steve Bannon. And, on Tuesday, he unmade him. \n \n Bannon, who served as Trump's senior White House strategist until he was fired in August 2017 , left as the head of Breitbart News -- roughly one week after quotes critical of Trump and his family went public in Michael Wolff's blockbuster book, \"Fire and Fury.\" \n \n Bannon's allegations -- that the July 2016 meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and several Russians who had promised dirt on Hillary Clinton was \"treasonous,\" for one -- set the President off. \n \n Trump took a flamethrower to Bannon , whom he suggested had lost his mind. He even gave Bannon a much dreaded nickname -- \"Sloppy Steve\" -- presumably in reference to Bannon's unshaved appearance and penchant for wearing three (or more) collared shirts layered on top of one another. \n \n By the time Bannon realized just how badly he had screwed up, it was too late. His groveling apology to Trump didn't move the needle. And his longtime financial patron, Rebekah Mercer, abandoned Bannon too. \n \n Read More",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Now that he's out of the White House, lost his main financial backer, and been ousted from Breitbart News, what comes next for Steve Bannon? That remained very much unclear on Wednesday, although one thing was clarified: \"Fox News will not be hiring Steve Bannon,\" a network spokesperson tells the Hill. That's not a huge surprise, notes Adweek, which points out a passage in the new book by Michael Wolff (a co-founder of Newser) that makes clear Bannon and Fox honcho Rupert Murdoch are not on great terms\u2014\"not least because Murdoch had Donald Trump's ear.\" Bannon reportedly doesn't think Murdoch understands US politics and told Trump as much. More on the Bannon fallout: The midterms: Bannon had vowed to lead a slate of anti-establishment candidates into office this year, \"but it's unclear\u2014and unlikely\u2014that Bannon could continue to be a player in politics during this year's midterms without major donors behind him and after being disavowed by the president, writes Rosie Gray at the Atlantic. What's more, Bannon also has lost his radio show on SiriusXM, because the company's contract was with Breitbart, not Bannon. His mistake: At CNN, Chris Cillizza thinks Bannon made one huge mistake in regard to Trump, who brought him from the political fringe to the White House. \"Somewhere along the way, Bannon forgot that Trump was the boss and he was the underling,\" writes Cillizza. \"Everything that happened after that was sadly predictable.\"",

    "document": "Story highlights Source says Broadwell is unlikely to be prosecuted for release of classified info \n \n \"He wants to maintain a distance and focus on his family,\" ex-aide says \n \n Petraeus to testify Friday before the House Intelligence Committee, says aide \n \n Contact continued between Petraeus and Broadwell after they split 4 months ago, says ex-aide \n \n Former CIA Director David Petraeus has not been following the media firestorm that erupted in the wake of his resignation last week after admitting to having had an affair, a former aide said Wednesday. \n \n \"He wants to maintain a distance and focus on his family at this time,\" said retired Col. Peter Mansoor, who added that he had spoken earlier in the day with Petraeus. \"He realizes it was a severe and morally reprehensible action, but he violated no laws,\" Mansoor said. \n \n The affair between the married former military man and his married biographer, Paula Broadwell, ended about four months ago, Mansoor said, though the two remained in contact afterward. \"Mostly in a professional capacity, where she's still trying to get her dissertation done and he was still trying to help her with that,\" he said. \n \n Asked how Petraeus, 60, was holding up, Mansoor said, \"He describes it as putting one foot in front of the other, and then repeating the process. So it's going to be a long, long road of healing for them. He understands that and he's focusing on it.\" \n \n Mansoor's remarks came hours after President Barack Obama declined Wednesday to join congressional voices calling for an investigation into why the FBI did not notify the White House and other political leaders sooner about the investigation into the affair that led to Petraeus' resignation. \n \n \"I am withholding judgment with respect to how the entire process surrounding Gen. Petraeus came up,\" Obama told reporters at the White House. \"We don't have all the information yet, but I want to say I have a lot of confidence generally in the FBI. So I'm going to wait and see.\" \n \n Obama said he agreed with Petraeus' decision to resign after acknowledging an affair, but praised his service to the country. \n \n \"From my perspective, at least, he has provided this country an extraordinary service,\" Obama said. \n \n He also said he had seen no evidence of any potentially damaging breach in national security stemming from the affair. \n \n JUST WATCHED Obama: Fiscal cliff a 'solvable' problem Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Obama: Fiscal cliff a 'solvable' problem 03:10 \n \n JUST WATCHED Gen. Allen's place in perplexing scandal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Gen. Allen's place in perplexing scandal 03:35 \n \n \"I have no evidence at this point from what I've seen that classified information was disclosed that in any way would have had a negative impact on our national security,\" Obama said. \n \n In Congress, lawmakers from both parties have complained about not having been notified sooner of the investigation that led to the resignation or about potential security breaches. \n \n Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, said he was increasingly concerned about the potential fallout from the affair and any national security implications, including possible links to the September 11 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans. \n \n Graham has called for a special select committee to investigate the attack. \n \n FBI Director Robert Mueller joined Deputy Director Sean Joyce and acting CIA Director Mike Morell in briefing the lawmakers. \n \n Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, D-California, said Tuesday that she had \"many questions about the nature of the FBI investigation, how it was instituted.\" \n \n \"And we'll be asking those questions,\" she said. \n \n But the committee's ranking Republican member, Sen. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, said Wednesday the group would not look into questions about the FBI investigation and how congressional leaders learned about it until after the bureau concludes its work. \n \n Petraeus has been scheduled to testify this week in private hearings on Capitol Hill about the Benghazi attack. Some Republicans have criticized the administration's response to the attack and have speculated that the timing of Petraeus' departure may have been linked to the congressional inquiry. \n \n But Petraeus offered Wednesday through his chief of staff to testify on Benghazi, Mansoor said. \"He did not like the conspiracies going around that somehow he had something to hide on Benghazi,\" he said. \"I think his offer to testify crossed with the Congress' request to him to testify. But anyway, he looks forward to that.\" \n \n Petraeus will testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Friday, a senior aide said. Feinstein said Tuesday that she hoped Petraeus would address her Senate panel as early as Friday. \n \n Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta on Wednesday defended his request to withhold the nomination of Gen. John Allen to NATO commander pending an investigation into his contacts with Jill Kelley, whose complaints about anonymous, harassing e-mails led to the discovery of the affair between Petraeus, 60, and Broadwell, 40. \n \n Broadwell's government security clearance has been suspended pending the outcome of investigations, two U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the move told CNN Wednesday. \n \n Defense officials announced Tuesday that the FBI had referred information to them indicating Allen may have exchanged potentially inappropriate e-mails with Kelley, who was a volunteer at MacDill Air Force Base. \n \n Kelley's access to MacDill without an escort has been suspended, a Defense Department official said Wednesday. \n \n She had been given access to the base because of her position as a booster and promoter of programs to help U.S. troops, the official said. \n \n A U.S. official familiar with the e-mails Allen sent to Kelley described them as warranting the investigation. \n \n \"If they got out, John Allen would be very embarrassed by them,\" said the official, who added that there was no evidence of physical contact between the two. \n \n The official said that the e-mails under investigation are from Allen. \n \n But a senior official close to Allen told CNN on Tuesday that the e-mails contained nothing pointing to sex or anything of a romantic nature. Allen may have said, informally, \"thanks sweetheart\" in an e-mail, the official close to Allen said. \n \n \"Anyone who knows him knows his style; he has a habit of replying to every single e-mail (he is sent). Kelley would e-mail his business and personal accounts,\" the official said. \n \n It will be up to the Defense Department's inspector general to decide if the e-mails' content represents conduct unbecoming an officer, said a third source, a senior U.S. official. \n \n Allen has yet to be questioned by Defense Department inspector general staff, but that could be completed in days, a U.S. official with knowledge of the investigation said. \n \n Allen, who was once stationed at the base, has denied wrongdoing, a senior defense official said. In a statement, Col. John Baker, the chief defense counsel of the Marine Corps, said Allen \"fully intends to cooperate\" with the inspector general's investigators. \n \n Broadwell's anonymous e-mail to Allen was sent after May, perhaps in June, the official said. \n \n The e-mail, which had also been sent to a number of other officers, bore the handle \"kelleypatrol -- or something similar,\" the official said. \n \n He described the e-mail as \"a warning that Kelley was a seductress or something along those lines\" and said it was vaguely threatening, but above all weird. \n \n \"Allen did not know it was (from) Broadwell,\" the official said. \n \n The official also said it was unclear when Kelley went to the FBI or whether Allen's warning to her was the trigger, but that Allen saw nothing in the e-mail's wording to warrant referral by him to the FBI. \n \n Kelley's version differs from one offered by the senior official close to Allen, who said it was Allen who received an anonymous e-mail about Kelley, and tipped her off that someone was threatening her. \n \n One of the sources familiar with Kelley said she first mentioned the alleged harassment in a casual conversation with an FBI agent whom she knew socially. She did not seek him out for action on the matter, but he was happy to help, the source said. The source added that Kelley did not know at first that the e-mails led to Petraeus. \n \n A source familiar with Kelley's version of events said the anonymous e-mails traced to Broadwell began in June. It wasn't until two months later that the FBI told Kelley who had sent the e-mails, said the source, adding that Kelley does not know Broadwell. \n \n The general counsel for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association identified Frederick Humphries as the agent initially contacted by Kelley about the anonymous e-mails. \n \n The counsel, Lawrence Berger, said Humphries and his wife had been friends for years with Kelley and her husband. \n \n Berger said Humphries took Kelley's concerns over the e-mails to the \"appropriate components\" at the FBI to investigate. \"He reported it to the proper channels and had no further part on the case.\" \n \n Kelley, 37, and her husband have released a statement saying they have been friends with Petraeus and his family for more than five years and asked for privacy. \n \n A source close to Kelley said Wednesday that Kelley said she had not had a sexual relationship with Petraeus or Allen. \n \n In mid-May, Allen got the first anonymous e-mail from someone using the handle \"Kelleypatrol\" that maligned Kelley and warned him to be wary of her, the source said. \n \n Allen forwarded it to Kelley, thinking she might have sent it as a joke, but she told him she had not, the source continued. \n \n The move to delay Allen's nomination was \"a prudent measure until we can determine what the facts are, and we will,\" Panetta told reporters Wednesday. \"No one should leap to any conclusions.\" \n \n He said Allen \"certainly has my continued confidence to lead our forces,\" a view shared by Obama, White House spokesman Jay Carney said. \n \n That Allen remains in command in Afghanistan suggests that there is no criminal issue, a U.S. official told CNN. But the official said the Defense Department's inspector general could still find evidence of criminal conduct. \n \n Kelley has not responded publicly to the latest news. \n \n Both Allen and Petraeus appear to know Kelley's sister, Natalie Khawam. The men wrote letters in support of the sister in a custody battle, court records show. \n \n On Monday, FBI agents were at Broadwell's home in Charlotte, North Carolina, according to spokeswoman Shelley Lynch. She declined to say what the agents were doing there. \n \n A senior law enforcement official close to the Broadwell investigation said Wednesday night that it appeared unlikely she would be prosecuted for any unauthorized release of classified information. \n \n The official told CNN National Security Contributor Fran Townsend that investigators were reviewing materials taken Monday from Broadwell's home, but that the information in question did not appear to be substantial; there may have been a technical violation but, if so, it was not egregious. \n \n Broadwell had previously turned over a computer to investigators. \n \n The official said Broadwell agreed to the search of her home but that officials also had secured a search warrant. \n \n The official stressed the decision whether to prosecute rests with the Justice Department. \n \n A source told CNN that Broadwell was acting as Petraeus' archivist and that the FBI had gone to her house to look for any documents she might have. \n \n As a commissioned officer in the military reserves, Broadwell would have had \"secret\" or \"top secret\" security clearance, military officials said. \n \n Access to information would have depended on what she needed to know to carry out an assigned task, said the officials, who would not go on the record about an ongoing investigation. \n \n Broadwell has said that she was working on a second book about Petraeus. Her LinkedIn profile lists her as \"Archivist/Biographer for General (Retired) David Petreaus.\" Her first book, \"All In,\" was about Petraeus' leadership. \n \n Broadwell has spoken about how she had to deal with sensitive information in the course of researching the first book. \n \n \"I had to follow very clear lines of non-disclosure and sign non-disclosure agreements, like my colleagues. I felt like I was almost held to a higher level of accountability because I could lose my clearance,\" Broadwell said in a speech last year. \"I think it was important to inform my writing, but I knew there was a clear line that I couldn't cross when I was writing it out.\" \n \n Petraeus has said he never shared classified information with Broadwell, said retired military officer John Nagl, who cited conversations in recent days with Petraeus. \n \n Broadwell, a military intelligence reservist, is assigned to West Point, the Army's military academy, according to her service record, which lists her assignment as \"United States Military Academy Staff & Faculty.\" In August, she was promoted to lieutenant colonel. \n \n Last month, during a speech at the University of Denver, Broadwell suggested the Sept. 11 attackers in Libya were targeting a secret prison at the Benghazi consulate annex, raising unverified concerns about possible security leaks. \n \n \"I don't know if a lot of you have heard this, but the CIA annex had actually taken a couple of Libyan militia members prisoner and they think that the attack on the consulate was an effort to get these prisoners back,\" she said. \n \n A senior intelligence official said no prisoners had been held at the annex. Broadwell did not provide a source for her information, and no evidence has emerged that it came from Petraeus. \n \n Administration officials have said the Benghazi assault was a terrorist attack. ||||| FILE POOL - In this July 9, 2011 file photo, USMC Gen.

    "document": "\"Someone is terrorizing'' Seminole Heights after third slaying in 11 days \n \n TAMPA \u2014 When asked Friday if Tampa police believe a serial killer is stalking the residents of Seminole Heights, interim Tampa Police Chief Brian Dugan paused for a moment. \n \n \"We can call it what we want,\" said a clearly frustrated Dugan, who called a news conference to talk about the discovery Thursday of yet another body, the third person to be shot and killed in the neighborhood in 11 days. \"If that brings attention to it, that's fine.\" \n \n The latest killing took place about 8 p.m. Thursday, Dugan said. It was both frustrating and hauntingly tragic. \n \n Anthony Naiboa, 20, should not even have been in the southeast part of Seminole Heights when he was shot, apparently without motive. After he left work Thursday night, he got on the wrong bus. His body was found near the intersection of 15th Street N. and E. Frierson Avenue, just 200 yards from where he left the bus and began walking. \n \n Police officers who were flooding the area because of the two previous murders heard the gun shots, Dugan said, but arrived too late. The shooter was gone. \n \n Authorities are releasing little information about their investigation, which is being assisted by the FBI. The three victims, Naiboa, Benjamin Edward Mitchell, 22, and Monica Caridad Hoffa, 32, are all connected by proximity and time-frame, said Dugan, who declined to say whether there is any connection between the type of weapon or ammunition used in the killings. \n \n As of now, he said, there is no suspect or motive. \n \n In addition to the FBI's help, Dugan said the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office and St. Petersburg Police have offered support. Crime Stoppers and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are teaming up on a $25,000 reward for information that leads to a suspect's arrest. \n \n Meanwhile, the hunt continues. \n \n \"I go from frustration to anger,'' Dugan said. \"Now we have someone terrorizing the neighborhood. It's just difficult to see this happen.\" \n \n \u2022\u2022\u2022 \n \n Naiboa's father began to worry Thursday night when his son didn't come home. He finally called police. \n \n \"We had to regretfully inform him that his son had been murdered,\" the chief said. \n \n The father of Benjamin Mitchell, whose body was found Oct. 9, was still grappling Friday with his loss along with the news that someone else's son had been killed. He met Friday with Naiboa's parents and they grieved together. \n \n \"To hear there was a third victim, and for him to meet Anthony Naibo's parents this morning, you can just imagine what's that's like,\" Dugan said. \n \n Authorities have said repeatedly that the victims did nothing wrong and there is no connection between them. \n \n But there are similarities. \n \n All three victims were bus riders and all three were shot at or near bus stops. Mitchell and Naiboa both attended Middleton High School. \n \n Mitchell was waiting for a bus at the stop on North 15th and E. Frierson when he was shot. Two days later, Hoffa was killed, but it would be another two days until her body was found on the 1000 block of E. New Orleans Avenue \u2014 about six blocks west of the Ellicott Street bus stop on the No. 9 line. A city worker found her body in a vacant lot. \n \n Naiboa was found at North 15th and Conover streets, a few hundred yards south from the No. 9 bus stop where he had gotten off and where Mitchell was killed 11 days earlier. \n \n Hoffa did not drive and relied heavily on public transportation, said Caz Taylor, 34, a close friend of Hoffa. \n \n \"Every day she was walking to the bus stop,\" Taylor said. \"That was not unusual.

It makes three killings in less than two weeks with no arrests. \n \n Police found Anthony Naiboa, 20, dead on North 15th Street near East Conover Street around 8 p.m. Thursday, according to Interim Chief Brian Dugan. \n \n \"Anthony last night was at work. He took the wrong bus to this neighborhood,\" Dugan said. \"He should not have been in this neighborhood.\" \n \n Police are investigating three suspicious deaths - on Oct. 9, Oct. 13 and Oct. 19 - in the Seminole Heights neighborhood. Dugan said police believe the three deaths are related. \n \n \u201cWhen you look at the timeframe, the proximity, that there is no apparent motive, that they are alone, the victims are a lot of the time, it's clear to me that they're all linked,\u201d Dugan said. \n \n Three people have been killed in less than 2 weeks in Seminole Heights. \n \n \"I go from frustration to anger on these unsolved homicides,\" Dugan said. \"Now we have someone terrorizing the neighborhood.\" \n \n Sign up for the daily Brightside Blend Newsletter Sign up for the daily Brightside Blend Newsletter Something went wrong.

The video shows a man who could help solve the Oct. 9 homicide of Brian Mitchell. \n \n \"Do not assume this is a white person. Do not assume this is a black person,\" Dugan said. \"Do not assume it's a {man}.\" \n \n Dugan said Tampa police do not have any leads or motives on the homicides as of Friday morning. He also recommended residents to turn on their porch lights and to stay in groups outside. \n \n \"We're not going to be held hostage,\" Dugan said. \n \n Dugan warned people not to walk alone in the Seminole Heights neighborhood after Mitchell's homicide and the Oct. 11 homicide of Monica Hoffa. Police found Hoffa dead on Oct. 13. \n \n Naiboa's murder happened between 200-300 yards of Mitchell's house, according to Dugan. \n \n As a result of the first two murders, Tampa police had already saturated the neighborhood. They got to the scene of the Thursday's shooting in minutes. They brought in the dogs and called in the SWAT team. However, the suspect has already gotten away. \n \n \u201cWe instantaneously had a perimeter set up last night. I was convinced that we were going to catch this person,\u201d Dugan said. \n \n Dugan said law enforcement needed the public's help in finding who is responsible for the crimes. \n \n \"There's no doubt in my mind that this person is out there, and it's frustrating and it makes me angry that they're able to vanish so quickly,\" Dugan said. \n \n The shootings have frightened people living and working in the area. \n \n Just a few blocks away, at a stretch of trendy stores and restaurants along Nebraska Avenue, there is concern customers could stay away. \n \n \u201cPeople will be scared to come in,\u201d said Marez George, who works at a local cafe. \u201cEspecially, I'm not talking about just this restaurant, the area itself. Like me, I'm scared to come around this area now,\u201d she said. \n \n Investigators are now checking area houses and businesses looking for security cameras that might have captured images around the time of the shootings. \n \n Dugan described the shooter as an animal and a terrorist, but stopped short of using the words \u2018serial killer\u2019. \n \n \u201cWe are still sifting through evidence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can call it what we want. If that brings attention to this, that's fine.\u201d \n \n Anyone with information on the crimes is asked to call the police. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and Crime Stoppers are also offering an $25,000 reward for tipsters at 1(800)873-8477. \n \n Last year, there was one murder in Seminole Heights and 14 shootings.

    "document": "The United States is home to an estimated 70 to 80 million pet dogs, making up 37 to 47 percent of all American households. We affectionately call them man\u2019s best friend, and they are, in fact, humankind\u2019s oldest \u201cfriend\u201d in the animal kingdom. Canis familiaris, the domestic dog, was the first species to be domesticated by humans from Eurasian gray wolves at least 15,000 years ago. What is largely unknown, however, is where. A new genomic study, published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, offers up strong evidence that domesticated dogs originated in Central Asia, around modern day Nepal and Mongolia. \n \n Previous genetic studies of dog lineages have concluded that domestication occurred in Southern China around 16,500 years ago, but the earliest archaeological evidence of domesticated canines is found in Europe and Siberia. All of this contrasting evidence has understandably created not a small amount of debate, but one thing that can be agreed upon is that all dogs came from Eurasian gray wolves at least 15,000 years ago. One key factor was largely neglected in previous studies, however. \n \n Canis familiaris can be broken down into essentially two main groups: One of pure breeds and mixed breeds\u2014about 400 types\u2014that make up most American pets and another, much larger group of free-roaming and breeding populations known simply as \u201cvillage dogs.\u201d Despite the wide variation in outward physical appearance, pure breeds are not genetically very diverse, because they come from such small, controlled gene pools. (Remember, as crazy as it seems, a Chihuahua and a St. Bernard are still the same species.) Most modern breeds, in fact, are only about 200 years old (though artificial selection by humans on dogs has been occurring for thousands of years). The majority of dogs, along with their genetic diversity, fall in the group of \u201cvillage dogs,\u201d and have much older lineages than the pure breeds. It makes them particularly important when studying dog evolution. Adam Boyko, of Cornell University, and his colleagues factored this group of dogs heavily into their study. \n \n Boyko\u2019s team analyzed 185,800 genetic markers in 5,392 dogs, including 549 village dogs from 38 countries, making their study the largest ever of worldwide canine genetic diversity. They found that genetic diversity is highest in Central Asia, specifically Nepal and Mongolia. Genetic diversity then fans out like ripples in a pool, with areas like Afghanistan, Egypt, India, and Vietnam\u2014all ringing around the possible center of origin in Central Asia\u2014having the next highest levels and so on. \u201cIt mirrors what we see in humans and how they spread out of East Africa,\u201d says Boyko. \n \n Dogs studied in geographic regions farther away, like the South Pacific and Americas were almost exclusively of European origin. This complicates things a bit, but the reason for that is likely the spread of modern Western culture and the appeal of pure breeds. \u201cEverybody wants a golden retriever,\u201d says Boyko. Perhaps one of the reasons village dogs with more indigenous traits have not been overcome by foreign gene flow in Central Asia is because they originated there and have large populations. They also might be better adapted to that environment, notes Boyko. \n \n \u201cAt Bichon Frise running wild in Mongolia is not going to do very well,\u201d he says, \u201cBut if Ulaanbaatar (the capital) became the next biggest city in Asia, then perhaps some Bichons would do alright there,\" and mix with the indigenous village dogs. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

The work looked at DNA from thousands of living dogs to piece together their ancestry and geographical origins. \n \n \u201cThis is the first global study of genomic patterns of dog diversity,\u201d says Adam Boyko of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who led the team. \u201cWe find a clear pattern of genetic diversity focused on central Asia, suggesting the first domesticated dogs came from this region.\u201d \n \n That departs from earlier studies that pinpointed Europe as where dogs were domesticated, although more recent work puts the location in southern China, just 1000 kilometres from the area Boyko\u2019s team proposes. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The team broke new ground by analysing DNA samples from so-called \u201cvillage dogs\u201d, which have lived alongside humans throughout the world since dogs first evolved from wolves and were domesticated around 15,000 years ago. \u201cAlthough they associate with humans, village dogs are more or less expected to make it on their own,\u201d says Boyko. \n \n Authentic signature \n \n \u201cThey are very different from pure-bred dogs genetically because they are free-breeding, so in a genetic sense, they are a natural population.\u201d Village dogs therefore carry a more authentic genetic signature of original dog populations than the modern-day breeds created in the past 200 years, mainly in Europe. \n \n Boyko\u2019s team took DNA samples from 549 village dogs in 38 countries all over the globe. They also took samples from 4676 pure-bred \u201cmodern\u201d dogs of 161 breeds, many of European origin. \n \n To further improve the reliability of the analysis, the team broadened the amount of DNA examined to include chromosomes inherited from both parents. Previous studies had relied mainly on mitochondrial DNA transmitted through the female line, or DNA from male sex chromosomes. \n \n By analysing 185,805 genetic markers, Boyko\u2019s team traced how all the animals were related, and from that how they had spread around the world. This essentially gave them a trail back to \u201cfounder\u201d dogs in Nepal and Mongolia. \n \n The analysis also revealed that following domestication, village dogs rapidly fanned out to other areas of Asia, particularly India and south-west and east Asia. \n \n Scavenging \n \n Boyko\u2019s team speculates that hunter-gatherers in central Asia domesticated dogs from grey wolves. A combination of increasing human population density, better hunting methods and climate change may have reduced the availability of prey and pushed some wolves towards scavenging, which favoured tameness and smaller size. This would in turn have reduced their hunting prowess further, setting them on the path to domestication. \n \n Other researchers have welcomed the tracing of domestication to the neighbourhood of central Asia, although some dispute the precise site. \n \n \u201cThey are actually putting the origin very close to where we put it, just 1000 kilometres away in parts of Asia south of the Yangtze river,\u201d says Peter Savolainen of the Royal Institute of Technology in Solna, Sweden. \u201cSo I would say the consensus pointing to south and east rather than central Asia is quite clear.\u201d \n \n Savolainen compliments the thoroughness of the study, but says that what is lacking is DNA from southern China, where he thinks dogs originated. \u201cSince they don\u2019t have a single sample from south China, they haven\u2019t falsified [my] theory,\u201d he says. \n \n Olaf Thalmann at Uppsala University in Sweden praises the scale of the study, and says its conclusion is reasonable. \u201cWe know that this region was pivotal for ancient trade, and it seems plausible that animals followed the trading routes and thus increased the local diversity,\u201d he says. \n \n But Thalmann doubts that the study is the final word on where dogs were tamed, because the DNA comes only from animals living today. \u201cI\u2019m convinced the only way to shed further light on the topic is by analysing ancient remains,\u201d he says. A consortium led by Greger Larson of the University of Oxford is now looking to doing just that. \n \n Larson says Boyko\u2019s result is important because it reaches a clear conclusion that can be tested further. \u201cWe are excited to be working with Boyko\u2019s group and others,\u201d he says. \n \n \u201cHaving collected more than 1500 ancient dogs and wolves over the past few years, our lab has begun our next-generation sequencing effort.\u201d The genetic data will then be compared with morphological data from more than 4000 specimens going right back into the late Pleistocene, he says. \n \n Journal reference: PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1516215112 \n \n (Image credit: FLPA/REX Shutterstock) \n \n Read more: \u201cMan\u2019s best friends: How animals made us human\u201c ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dogs may have become man's best friend in Central Asia, according to the study \n \n Today's dogs can trace their origins to Central Asia, according to one of the most comprehensive genetic surveys yet. \n \n Dogs are the most diverse animal on the planet - a legacy of thousands of years of selective breeding by humans. \n \n But they derive from wild wolves that were gradually tamed and inducted into human hunting groups - perhaps near Mongolia or Nepal. \n \n The findings come from an analysis of DNA from thousands of pooches, and are published in PNAS journal. \n \n Cornell University's Dr Adam Boyko and his colleagues studied 4,676 purebred dogs from recognised breeds, as well as 549 \"village dogs\" - free-ranging animals that live around human settlements. \n \n They hitched themselves to us, which was a pretty good gamble as it turned out Dr Adam Boyko, Cornell University \n \n This latter group are the least studied, yet represent a crucial piece in the picture of modern dog diversity. \n \n \"The fact that we looked at so many village dogs from so many different regions, we were able to narrow in on the patterns of diversity in these indigenous dogs,\" Dr Boyko told BBC News. \n \n Dog domestication is the kind of event that could have taken place independently in different corners of the globe. But the DNA of modern pooches doesn't provide any support for this idea. \n \n \"We looked exclusively to see if there was evidence of multiple domestication events. And like every other group that's looked for that, we found no evidence of it,\" said Dr Boyko. \n \n \"It looks like there's a single origin, although there are clearly situations where there has been... a little bit of gene flow between wolves and dogs post-domestication.\" \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Dog ownership is growing in popularity across many parts of Asia \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption A Tibetan mastiff dog is seen at a show in China's northern Hebei province \n \n Confusing picture \n \n The researchers studied genes that are located close to one another on dog chromosomes. The patterns of these closely linked genetic markers allowed the team to pinpoint the domestication event to Central Asia. \n \n But several other teams have tackled the same problem, and have come up with widely differing results. \n \n Previous studies have variously hinted at an origin for dogs in the Middle East - perhaps scavenging the food waste of early farmers - in East Asia, and in Europe. \n \n The latest results are unlikely to resolve the argument, but Dr Boyko said that localising the origin of dogs could stimulate further research. One of these further lines of inquiry could be the analysis of ancient DNA from dog remains found at archaeological sites. \n \n This tool could help support or refute hypotheses about the role of Central Asia and other regions in the domestication of \"man's best friend\". \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption DNA studies have shown that modern dogs descended from their wolf ancestors \n \n Dr Peter Savolainen, associate professor at KTH - Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, said the study had shown it was possible to find remote dog populations that had been unaffected by mixing with European varieties - a legacy of the era of colonisation. \n \n But he suspects the origins of domestication lie in East Asia, perhaps in southern China. \n \n \"Mongolia is technically in East Asia and Nepal is in South Asia... only a thousand kilometres from South China,\" he told BBC News. \n \n \"So we have a consensus that the origin is somewhere in this general region. But one important thing is that they do not have a specimen from China, so if they had, what would that have shown?\" \n \n Most researchers agree that dogs have been around for at least 15,000 years. But the reasons for their emergence remain opaque. \n \n \"There's no doubt they were hanging around [hunting] camps and becoming gradually more attuned to human life. The question is what was the first step for why that was happening,\" said Dr Boyko. \n \n \"It's tempting to ask whether it was something to do with hunting. I think it's clear that scavenging by wolves on human kills [of large mammals] could have been the driving force. \n \n He added that genetic changes in those wolves, that led to tameness, small body size and early age of first reproduction could have started the animals down an evolutionary course that was less compatible with a hunting lifestyle. \n \n \"They hitched themselves to us, which was a pretty good gamble as it turned out, because there are about a billion dogs in the world today and probably not even 10 million wolves.\" \n \n Follow Paul on Twitter.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Your best pal may have come a long way to curl up at your feet: A new DNA study of more than 5,000 dogs from 38 countries finds they probably originated in Central Asia, or Mongolia and Nepal more specifically, at least 15,000 years ago, reports the BBC. Cornell researchers drew blood from 4,676 purebred dogs\u2014making up 161 breeds typically created in the last 200 years\u2014and 549 street dogs with older lineages to study chromosomes inherited from the male and female line, reports New Scientist.

That suggests the most recent common ancestor of \"all the dogs alive today\" came from that region, says lead author Adam Boyko. \"It mirrors what we see in humans and how they spread out of East Africa.\" It's possible some dogs were domesticated elsewhere but diversified in Central Asia.

But as similar studies suggest dogs originated in the Middle East, East Asia, and Europe, some scientists are treating the results with caution. One tells the New York Times that only a study of ancient and modern DNA could provide definitive results.

Facebook can, however, cover the cost of employees\u2019 food if they dine in restaurants that are open to the public. \n \n The restriction was enforced after local restaurants complained that free meals at Google, the city\u2019s largest employer, had damaged their business. \n \n \u201cWe wanted to make sure businesses that were there were successful,\u201d the councilman John McAlister told the Chronicle. \n \n Neither Facebook nor Google responded to requests for comment. \n \n Tech companies offer staff free food partly because some of their offices were built in suburban wastelands with few local restaurants, partly as a deal sweetener in a highly competitive job market, and partly to squeeze more working hours out of every day. \n \n It\u2019s a popular perk, and one that causes Facebook employees to joke about the \u201cFacebook 15\u201d, the inevitable weight gain in pounds that comes from being surrounded by so many free delicious treats. \n \n In their efforts to satisfy tech workers\u2019 various appetites, tech companies have poached some of the Bay Area\u2019s best chefs, promising better pay and more sociable hours. \n \n The rules for Facebook\u2019s new office are designed to encourage the thousands of tech workers to spend some money in and integrate with the local community, rather than arriving in a bus each day and never leaving the building. \n \n \n \n This is what the restaurant industry says has happened in San Francisco, where tech companies like Twitter, Uber, Airbnb, Yelp and Square were offered tax breaks in exchange for locating their offices in the Mid-Market neighbourhood. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook\u2019s headquarters in Menlo Park.

But if people are bussed in, go to work and never leave the building, the effect isn\u2019t felt.\u201d \n \n Axing company cafeterias also means axing jobs that, depending on the company, can come with good pay and benefits. \n \n In March, cafeteria workers at Facebook\u2019s Menlo Park headquarters unionised, a move that secured $4.75 an hour in raises, affordable healthcare and a pension plan. The ban on having a free cafeteria in the Mountain View complex could mean losing well-paid jobs to minimum-wage jobs in nearby restaurants. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re not convinced an outright ban makes a lot of sense,\u201d said Ian Lewis, the research director at the labour union Unite Here. \n \n \u201cOne of the main problems here is an affordability crisis where working people are getting forced out and we need more good well-paying jobs with good healthcare and pensions,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cIf employee cafeterias provide those jobs that\u2019s fine with us.\u201d \n \n Contact the author: olivia.solon@theguardian.com ||||| When Facebook moves into its new offices in Mountain View this fall, a signature Silicon Valley perk will be missing \u2014 there won\u2019t be a corporate cafeteria with free food for about 2,000 employees. \n \n In an unusual move, the city barred companies from fully subsidizing meals inside the offices, which are part of the Village at San Antonio Center project, in an effort to promote nearby retailers. The project-specific requirement passed in 2014, attracting little notice because the offices were years away from opening. \n \n It came in response to local restaurants that said Google, the city\u2019s biggest employer, was hurting their businesses by providing free meals, according to John McAlister, a Mountain View councilman. \n \n \u201cWe wanted to make sure businesses that were there were successful,\u201d McAlister said. \n \n The daily banquets at big tech companies \u2014 fresh-made omelets for breakfast, hand-rolled sushi for lunch, braised chicken and kale for dinner \u2014 have become legendary. Google hired its first chef about 20 years ago, when the company had just 50 employees. Reviews of its corporate cuisine popped up on Bon Appetit, Serious Eats and Yelp. \n \n New companies such as Facebook and LinkedIn matched the perk as they tried to lure employees away. Staffing the cafeterias became a booming business for the formerly sleepy field of corporate catering. But the in-house eating places have drawn customers and potential employees away from neighboring businesses, and city officials are concerned that local restaurants struggle and potentially bustling streets are empty as a result. \n \n Under Mountain View\u2019s rules for the Village complex, meals within the offices can\u2019t be subsidized by more than 50 percent on a regular basis. Facebook can fully subsidize employees if they go to restaurants that are open to the public. \n \n \u201cIt really was geared more around trying to make sure we didn\u2019t have 400,000 square feet of office space with people that never left the building,\u201d said Michael Kasperzak, a former Mountain View mayor who worked on the legislation. \u201cIf we have all these restaurants, we want this to be a successful development. If employers pay for it, that\u2019s fine.\u201d \n \n After leaving office, Kasperzak went on to work as a consultant for WeWork, the large New York operator of co-working spaces. Though Facebook is the sole tenant for now, WeWork is managing Facebook\u2019s facility and is considering a public food hall in the ground floor, according to city officials. \n \n WeWork and Facebook declined to comment on the requirement. \n \n \u201cWe found the location attractive because of its proximity to public transportation, housing and public-serving amenities like shops and restaurants,\u201d said Facebook spokesman Jamil Walker. Unlike many tech campuses, the Village project is adjacent to a Caltrain station and includes housing. \n \n The absence of an in-house cafeteria will help boost local retailers, said Steve Rasmussen, owner of the Milk Pail Market, a 44-year-old open-air produce market blocks from Facebook\u2019s future office. \n \n \u201cA lot of small, independent restaurants had been impacted when some of these companies went in-house with their food offerings,\u201d Rasmussen said. \u201cI think collaboration is vital, and it makes total sense.\u201d \n \n Rasmussen is in talks with local restaurants to stock ready-to-eat meals at Milk Pail Market, which currently lacks such fare. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re very excited about what can we do to collaborate with the young folks who will come in with Facebook,\u201d he said. \n \n Mountain View has been seeking other concessions from tech giants. A November ballot measure proposes a per-employee tax that would hit Google the hardest. Last year, a new Google campus called Charleston East will be partially open to the public, including restaurants that anyone can dine in. \n \n While the cafeteria provision only applies to the Facebook site, it\u2019s possible Mountain View could seek to impose similar conditions on Google\u2019s next major expansion in the North Bayshore area, where it has its headquarters campus. \n \n Mountain View Councilwoman Margaret Abe-Koga said it\u2019s possible Google could help subsidize the rent for small businesses on its property or have agreements with retailers to patronize their businesses. \n \n Google didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on its North Bayshore plans regarding small businesses. \n \n Abe-Koga said the concept of tech companies offering free food was uncommon 20 years ago, and cities were in favor of companies in business parks having their own cafeterias because it reduced traffic. With projects like Village at San Antonio now featuring a mix of housing, office and retail, getting people outside their offices to frequent nearby businesses is key, she said. \n \n Mountain View\u2019s neighbors don\u2019t have plans to impose similar requirements on employee cafeterias. Cupertino Vice Mayor Rod Sinks said it\u2019s already common to see Apple employees dine at local restaurants; the company charges employees for meals, making outside offerings relatively more attractive. Apple is more concerned with secrecy: It built a glassy restaurant that resembles one of its gadget stores on Alves Drive in Cupertino. A stand-alone building, it\u2019s in walking distance of some Apple offices. Though the building is on a commercial street, the public can\u2019t enter unless they\u2019re the guest of an employee. \n \n In San Jose, there are no prohibitions on businesses offering free food, with the exception of its City Hall. When it was designed more than a decade ago, there were concerns that a cafeteria there would compete with local food businesses, so the city didn\u2019t build one. Adobe\u2019s downtown headquarters has partially subsidized cafeterias. \n \n Near San Jose\u2019s Diridon Station, Google is planning another huge development. There has been no talk of restricting subsidized meals there, said Nanci Klein, San Jose\u2019s assistant director of economic development. \n \n Chris Foley, co-owner of the Market, a food hall underneath Twitter\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco, hopes that one day the city will follow Mountain View\u2019s lead. Restaurants have opened in the Mid-Market neighborhood in hopes of gaining customers from the tech companies there, but a number have shuttered and struggled. If there were no meals served inside those offices, that would greatly benefit restaurants and food vendors like those in the Market, he said. \n \n \u201cHaving (tech workers) in their offices and not engaging with the community isn\u2019t really good for the community or these small businesses,\u201d Foley said. \n \n Zendesk, a customer-support software business located a couple of blocks down Market, doesn\u2019t offer free lunch. Instead, CEO Mikkel Svane has recommended employees go to nearby restaurants such as Tu Lan and Farmerbrown. Once a month, the company pays for a group of employees to try a new restaurant, said spokeswoman Courtney Mundell. \n \n Wendy Lee and Roland Li are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.

The sitter did not agree to clean the fish bowl or change the water and was told to feed it less, according to court documents. \n \n \n \n Documents provided by Richmond, the company's attorney, show only two pets on the contract -- dogs Bogey and Barley. \n \n The complaint also said McWhorter and her husband \"have had to deal with numerous rape and death threats\" and other forms of harassment. \n \n The Duchouquettes' review is still up on the page, which has an average of 4.5 stars, but the Yelp page for the company now features a consumer alert reminding reviewers that they have a First Amendment right to express their opinions. \n \n The business \"may be trying to abuse the legal system in an effort to stifle free speech, including issuing questionable legal threats against reviewers,\" the alert states. \n \n On Twitter: \n \n @clairezcardona ||||| The six-month saga of the Texas petsitter who sued a customer for up to $1 million in damages over a negative Yelp review appears to have come to an end, with a judge agreeing to dismiss the case that made national headlines. \n \n Just to backtrack, in case you\u2019ve somehow had more important things to read about than petsitter-related litigation in the Lone Star State. \n \n A couple in Plano, TX, hired a local petsitting company to look after their dogs and fish while they were on vacation. The customers weren\u2019t terribly thrilled about the quality of service they received and shared their feedback publicly on Yelp in Oct. 2015. \n \n The petsitting company not only responded to that write-up, but followed it with a cease-and-desist notice directing the customers to remove their review. When they did not take their Yelp post down, the petsitter filed a lawsuit in justice of the peace court for around $6,700, accusing the couple of violating a non-disparagement clause in the petsitter\u2019s customer agreement. \n \n Non-disparagement clauses are questionably legal conditions inserted into contracts and agreements that try to prohibit consumers from freely expressing their opinion on a transaction. California recently outlawed such clauses and a bipartisan bill that would make them illegal nationwide is waiting for Congress to return for a vote. \n \n After the initial lawsuit made national headlines, the petsitter dropped that complaint and re-filed their case in a state district court, expanding on the allegations to include defamation and upping the damage request to as much as $1 million. \n \n By this point, the case had attracted the attention of advocates for consumers and free expression. Attorney Paul Alan Levy from Public Citizen took on the task of asking the court to dismiss the case, arguing that the petsitter\u2019s complaint is a frivolous SLAPP. That\u2019s a \u201cStrategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation\u201d; in other words, a lawsuit filed in the hopes of getting the defendant to shut up. \n \n The Texas Citizens Participation Act is an example of a so-called \u201canti-SLAPP\u201d statute, allowing the defendants in cases involving issues of speech to seek a dismissal if the plaintiff can\u2019t \u201cestablish by clear and specific evidence a prima facie case for each essential element of the claim in question.\u201d \n \n READ MORE ABOUT SLAPPs & ANTI-SLAPP STATUTES \n \n The judge heard from all parties involved in this mess in late July and today issued an order [PDF] dismissing the petsitter\u2019s lawsuit. \n \n In accordance with the Texas anti-SLAPP law, the defendants are also now entitled to recover court costs and reasonable and necessary attorney fees from the petsitter. \n \n Levy says that by \u201cseeking to silence negative criticism,\u201d the petsitters may have ended up risking the future of their entire company. \n \n \u201cNot only did the company lose business when customers were disgusted over the non-disparagement lawsuit, it now is responsible to pay attorney fees and sanctions,\u201d he explains. \n \n In a statement, the couple expressed their relief and gratitude regarding today\u2019s ruling. \n \n \u201cWe should all have the opportunity to express our opinions without the fear of a lawsuit,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cWe are so grateful for the attorneys who have supported us through the case.

After the lawsuit received broad coverage in the media, and the couple filed an anti-SLAPP motion, the company dismissed its small-claims proceeding and sued in state district court alleging that the broader attention that had been brought to the controversy had hurt the company\u2019s business, warranting an award of up to a million dollars in damages as well as an award or attorney fees. Public Citizen then entered the case on behalf of the reviewer and her husband, filing both an appeal from the implicit denial of the anti-SLAPP motion in small-claims court, and a new anti-SLAPP motion in the Texas district court. The trial court dismissed both the libel claim and the non-disparagement clause claim with prejudice, and held that the Duchouquettes would be awarded their reasonable attorney fees as well as sanctions to deter future such lawsuits. \n \n",

The Duchouquettes posted the bad review after hiring the company to look after their two dogs and betta fish during a trip to Texas, and returning to find that the betta fish had apparently been overfed. The company initially sued for nearly $7,000, but later filed a suit for the higher amount, claiming the couple had violated a non-disparagement clause in their agreement.

Its campaign included full-page newspaper advertisements on Monday apologizing for the attack and the first interview since the breach by chief executive Gregg Steinhafel. \n \n He told CNBC TV business network that Target wanted to lead the retail industry\u2019s move to adopt payment card technology that stores customer information on computer chips and requires users to type in personal identification numbers. \n \n On Sunday, a top executive with the National Retail Federation called for tougher security standards that could mean more spending for the industry, its banks and business partners following the breaches at Target and other retailers in the United States. \n \n Steinhafel said he was proud of the way Target employees had responded once the breach was confirmed, yet he provided few details about what had happened. \n \n Target disclosed on December 19 that it was victim to one of the biggest credit card breaches on record. It said it ran for 19 days in the busy holiday shopping season through December 15. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to get to the bottom of this,\u201d Steinhafel told CNBC. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to rest until we understand what happened and how that happened.\u201d \n \n The company declined to say precisely when it first came to suspect its systems might have been compromised. \n \n Related Coverage Changing card PIN only first step after Target breach: experts \n \n In the CNBC interview, Steinhafel said the company \u201cconfirmed\u201d that it had been victim of a breach on December 15, but he provided no account of what happened in preceding weeks. \n \n \u201cDecember 15. That was the day we confirmed that we had an issue,\u201d he said. \n \n Sources familiar with the investigation have previously told Reuters that Target learned about the attack only after receiving warnings from financial industry sources who reported seeing a surge in fraudulent credit card activity from accounts of customers who had shopped at the retailer. \n \n Another retailer, Neiman Marcus, disclosed on Friday that it was warned about a possible breach in mid-December and that an outside forensics firm confirmed a breach on January 1, saying it found evidence that some payment card data may have been compromised. \n \n Target and Neiman Marcus are not the only U.S. retailers whose networks were breached over the holidays, according to sources familiar with attacks on other merchants that have yet to be publicly disclosed. \n \n Smaller breaches at least three other well-known U.S. retailers took place over the holiday season and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on Target, according to the people familiar with the attacks. Similar breaches may have occurred earlier last year. \n \n Stores and card processing companies have reported a steady stream of security breaches for years without a major backlash from consumers, such as those disclosed by TJX Cos in 2007 and by Heartland Payment Systems Inc in 2009. \n \n But the latest thefts could mark a watershed moment for security standards as calls grow for changes in the protection of consumer information. \n \n \u2018CHIP-AND-PIN\u2019 CARDS \n \n People shop at a Target store during Black Friday sales in the Brooklyn borough of New York, in this November 29, 2013, file photo. REUTERS/Eric Thayer/Files \n \n One sign of the change is the new enthusiasm for \u201cChip-and-PIN\u201d payment cards, which have computer chips built into them and require users to type in PINs. \n \n Mallory Duncan, general counsel of the National Retail Federation that represents Target, Wal-Mart and other stores, said on Sunday that the trade group encouraged its members to upgrade to the higher-security cards even though they cost more than old systems that store data on magnetic stripes. \n \n The breaches are \u201cunfortunate but we\u2019re not entirely surprised,\u201d Duncan said at his organization\u2019s annual convention in New York. \n \n \u201cThe technology that exists in cards out there is 20th-century technology and we\u2019ve got 21st-century hackers,\u201d he said. \n \n Duncan said the trade group had only made its backing for the higher-security cards public since the Target breach. Banks have quietly begun to offer the cards but mainly for customers to use while traveling. Big U.S. card networks led by Visa Inc will not require the higher security until next year at the earliest. \n \n It is not clear that \u201cChip-and-PIN\u201d technology would have prevented the breaches at Target and elsewhere. At the very least they make stolen data harder to re-use, a reason the technology has caught on widely in Europe and Asia. \n \n They have met with much less enthusiasm in the United States, in part because losses to fraud - just 5 cents for every $100 spent via plastic - have been manageable for merchants and their banks. But rising fraud rates, and the risk of identity theft, could change the calculation. \n \n The new scrutiny began after Target disclosed its breach. Investigators believe hackers used malware that captured data on customers from the magnetic stripes on their payment cards. \n \n Duncan said no other members had told the NRF they had been breached. \n \n Executives of several other companies said over the weekend that they were not aware of breaches at their companies. The executives included representatives of Sears Holdings Corp, JCPenney Co, Macy\u2019s Inc and Gap Inc. \n \n A shopper enters a Neiman Marcus store in Oak Brook, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, in this May 2, 2005 file photo.

Several speakers cited it in remarks and some tried to distance their companies from vulnerabilities. \n \n Stan Lippelman, vice president of marketing at Bass Pro Shops, a privately-held outdoor goods seller, said: \u201cWe feel very comfortable with where we are at.

    "document": "A recent Colorado Tourism Office survey of summer travelers shows 48 percent were influenced by legal recreational pot \n \n Marijuana businesses have long proclaimed that cannabis is drawing visitors to Colorado. Now they have proof. \n \n A study commissioned by the Colorado Tourism Office and presented to the office's board of directors on Wednesday shows legal weed as a growing motivator for trips to Colorado \u2014 conflicting with the mantra of tourism officials statewide that savvy marketing alone is responsible for record visitation and spending in the past two years. \n \n While the state's \"Come to Life\" ad campaign is certainly successful, surveys in October and November of potential summertime visitors who were exposed to the state's tourism ads revealed that the marijuana laws influenced vacation decisions nearly 49 percent of the time. \n \n Budtender Kate Evans, behind counter, helps a customer at Native Roots Dispensary at 1550 Champa street in Denver on December 9. (Helen H. Richardson, The Denver Post) \n \n \"I think it is rearing its head as a significant travel and tourism amenity for visitors coming to Colorado,\" said Al White, who retired as boss of the Colorado Tourism Office in August and now serves on the board of a cannabis tourism company. \n \n But the survey's director said the questions may not have captured the opinion of people who opted out of Colorado travel because of legal pot. And only 8 percent of the Colorado tourists who responded to the survey said they visited a marijuana dispensary. \n \n \"I think definitely the laws are having an influence when people are considering Colorado. We can see that it's still not a large percentage in terms of what people are doing, but it's become more of a motivator for those who want to do it,\" said Denise Miller, director of tourism surveys for Strategic Marketing and Research Insights, or SMARI, as she presented the midyear update to the tourism office's board of directors. \"It's certainly having some influence \u2014 both, I think, positive and negative \u2014 on that decision process.\" \n \n SMARI conducted 33-question surveys of 3,254 tourists from target markets in Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, San Diego, St. Louis and other cities. About 10 percent of those surveyed had vacationed in Colorado between April and September. \n \n The state tourism office has spent more than $5.3 million to run its \"Come to Life\" television, print, billboard and digital ads in these cities as well as nationally this summer. The campaign hit 11.1 million households, up from 9.4 million in 2014. \n \n SMARI estimated the 2015 summer ad campaign spurred 2.1 million leisure trips, generating an economic impact of $2.6 billion. That means for every dollar the state invested in its tourism promotion effort, it generated a $490 return, up from $344 in 2014. \n \n So the ad campaign is working very well. But those ads never mention marijuana. Yet, 22 percent of survey respondents said marijuana was \"extremely influential\" in their decision to visit Colorado. Twenty percent said it was \"very much influential\" and nearly 7 percent said it was \"somewhat influential.\" \n \n But only 8 percent of tourists said they visited a marijuana dispensary during their trip to Colorado \u2014 the same percentage who said they visited a pot shop last year, according to SMARI's survey. \n \n Of the 8 percent who went pot shopping, 85 percent this year said marijuana was a primary motivator of their visit to Colorado, up from 29 percent last year. \n \n Retail sales of recreational marijuana became legal Jan. 1, 2014. \n \n Last year \u2014 the first year SMARI asked marijuana questions to potential Colorado vacationers \u2014 65 percent of Colorado visitors did not consider legal weed in their vacation decision, with the remainder split between respondents saying they were \"more likely to visit\" and \"less likely to visit\" because of marijuana. \n \n This year, those results moved slightly, with 20 percent of potential Colorado vacationers saying the state's marijuana laws made them more likely to book a vacation and 15 percent saying they were less likely. The remainder said it wasn't an issue. \n \n The question in SMARI's summer survey asked: \"How much did the legalization of marijuana usage influence your decision to visit Colorado?\" \n \n SMARI's Miller said her team needs to follow up with better questions. \n \n New tourism office chief Cathy Ritter, who started her job last week, said last month that legal cannabis is \"a great topic for discussion and a great topic for more research.\" \n \n Ritter did not speak during the board discussion of marijuana Wednesday. But in November, when she was named to the post, she said it \"seems to be that the tourism program today is essentially silent on the whole issue.\" \n \n In Telluride, where 80 percent of voters approved recreational weed in 2012, the new tourism tagline is \"The Most Colorado Place on Earth.\" It's one of the few Colorado towns that doesn't ignore pot as a guest amenity. One local dispensary delivers goods through its own app. \n \n \"We dabble, but ... we don't want to fly the freak flag. I don't want to put it under the rug, but I don't want it to be the most important thing we do,\" said Michael Martelon, the president of the Telluride Tourism Board, noting that taxes from weed in the town rarely top 3 percent of the town's overall sales tax revenue. \n \n When White announced 2014's record visitation and spending in June this year, he was quick to not credit cannabis. \n \n \"This is because we are doing a good job in Colorado. Is marijuana beneficial?\" said White in June of this year. \"Marginally, yes, I think it may be a decision influencer for some people coming.\" \n \n Marijuana is no longer in the margins of Colorado tourism. It's taking a starring role. \n \n \"It's extremely influential,\" White said this week. \n \n Danny Schaefer let out a hoot when he heard the recent survey numbers. His My420Tours hosts 120 to 200 visitors a week and just inked a deal with a national hotel chain to host his clients, each getting a cannabis vaporizer to use in the room when they check-in. (He won't name the chain yet. White is a member of his board.) \n \n \"This is absolutely validating,\" said Schaefer, who has urged tourism leaders to celebrate marijuana before other states where the recreational sales are legal, including Oregon and Washington, steal the tourism thunder. He's making plans to expand to Portland, Ore., where, he said, local tourism officials are welcoming him. \n \n \"The state of Colorado has had an amazing opportunity to embrace this industry,\" he said. \"It a complete advantage for Colorado to become the Napa Valley and Sonoma County of cannabis.\" \n \n Selling, possessing and using marijuana is illegal under federal law. State officials say they have never promoted marijuana because Amendment 64 regulations prevent pot businesses from advertising outside Colorado. \n \n Schaefer says that's fine. But visitors need information. Why doesn't the state help on that front, he wondered. Education doesn't have to be advertising, he said. \n \n \"Shatter, wax, hash, dabs and transdermals. Our visitors, they have no idea what the modern industry has in the store for them and they are really lacking that education,\" Schaefer said. \"Consumption education is absolutely necessary. We have so many people saying we were looking for information on marijuana on Colorado.com or at a Visit Denver welcome center and they couldn't find anything even mentioning marijuana.

That\u2019s not what\u2019s happening,\u201d she said. \n \n Instead, most tourists are coming to Colorado to partake in other recreational activities, she said. But being able to purchase legal marijuana in Colorado is \u201cthe icing on the cake.\u201d \n \n The attraction of marijuana is likely to diminish as a tourism factor in the coming years because other states are working on legalization efforts, Taylor said. There are efforts in nine states to legalize marijuana in 2016, CNN reported in November. \n \n The study also found that while some people surveyed were purchasing marijuana legally for the first time, 200 of the 325 people used marijuana daily. \n \n \u201cIf you are a daily user, you probably have access to product that you wouldn\u2019t have to pay such a high tax on, but yet these people are going to the legal shops as opposed to the black market,\u201d she said. \n \n Many people said they preferred to buy products legally because legal weed is more likely to have been tested. Therefore, it\u2019s safer to use. \n \n The views reflected in the survey came mostly from men younger than 30 because that demographic was the most open to sharing, Taylor said. \n \n Taylor plans to continue her survey work in the spring. At that time, she plans to hone in on the main reasons why tourists purchase marijuana using a methodology that could be replicated by other researchers. ||||| Partygoers listen to music and smoke marijuana on one of several days of the annual 4/20 marijuana festival, in Denver's downtown Civic Center Park, Saturday April 18, 2015.

The Denver Post reports a study commissioned by the Colorado Tourism Office found nearly 49% of Colorado visitors between April and September came at least in part because of pot. \"I think it is rearing its head as a significant travel and tourism amenity for visitors coming to Colorado,\" a former tourism office head says. The survey also showed 20% of potential tourists were more likely to visit Colorado because of legal weed compared to 15% who were less likely. Somewhat surprisingly, only 8% of tourists surveyed admitted to actually visiting a marijuana dispensary while in the state. A smaller study out of Fort Lewis College found most tourists come to Colorado for other reasons, but legal marijuana is \"the icing on the cake,\" the Durango Herald reports. According to the Post, Colorado has welcomed a record number of tourists in the past two years. Prior to the study, tourism officials had been crediting that increase solely to \"savvy marketing.\" The Colorado Tourism Office spent more than $5.3 million on a new advertising campaign, which doesn't mention pot at all, Colorado Public Radio reports. But it shouldn't be that way, the owner of one pot tourism company tells the Post: \"The state of Colorado has had an amazing opportunity to embrace this industry.

Two policemen were hurt. \n \n Previously police detained members of Women of the Wall, a group challenging the Orthodox monopoly over rites at Jerusalem's Western Wall, for wearing prayer shawls in violation of Orthodox tradition. \n \n This time police arrested five religious protesters instead. \n \n The police response followed a court ruling last month that found that the group was not in violation of the law. \n \n The issue is at the heart of a long struggle between a secular majority and an ultra-Orthodox minority over lifestyle in a country where institutions such as marriage, divorce and burial are controlled by religious authorities. \n \n Dozens of border policemen formed a cordon to keep the protesters at the site - revered as part of the Biblical Jewish Temple compound - from charging at the approximately 100 women and some male supporters as they prayed. \n \n \"They're desecrating the site of our holy temple,\" shouted one of the hundreds of Orthodox women who also came to protest against Women of the Wall. \n \n Yocheved Malachi called it shocking that women would wear prayer shawls or other religious gear, which Orthodox tradition reserves solely for men. \n \n Friday's prayers were the first in weeks in which police avoided any showdown with Women of the Wall, whose members have been detained in the past and charged with disruption for violating Orthodox traditions at a holysite. They are seeking a greater role in prayer ritual. \n \n \"I'm seeing signs of progress,\" one woman worshipper, Lisa Kainan, said about the police presence at the site. \n \n Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has asked former cabinet minister and Jewish leader Natan Sharansky to seek a compromise to permit the Women of the Wall to hold prayers without exacerbating tensions with the ultra-Orthodox Jews. \n \n Sharansky has since proposed a formula to widen a separate zone at the Western Wall once designated for egalitarian prayer, a suggestion neither side nor the government has yet embraced. \n \n Also spurring Israel's drive to resolve the dispute is the growing support for the Women of the Wall movement among Jews in the United States, Israel's main ally. \n \n (Editing by Angus MacSwan) ||||| Haredi worshippers clashed with police in Jerusalem's Old City early Friday in the wake of the court authorization for the Women of the Wall to pray at the Jewish holy site. \n \n Thousands of female haredi worshipers arrived at the site, heeding the call of community leaders rabbis Ovadia Yosef and Aharon Leib Shteinman who entreated female Ulpan students to hold a mass prayer at the Western Wall on Friday in an attempt to push aside the Women of Wall prayer set for the same time. However, the rabbis stressed there is no need to act provocatively or violently. \n \n Holy Site Zionist rabbis vs. Women of Wall Kobi Nachshoni Religious Zionism leaders join battle against liberal female worshippers following court ruling allowing them to wear prayer shawl at Western Wall. Yeshiva students prepare to gather at holy site on Friday during women's monthly prayer Zionist rabbis vs. Women of Wall \n \n A mass brawl erupted at the site at around 6:30 am, during which garbage, water, coffee and various objects were flung at dozens of Women of the Wall and police forming a human barrier between the female group and the ultra-Orthodox. Three yeshiva students were detained during the clashes. Two police officers were injured lightly. \n \n \n \n \n \n Women of the Wall (photo: Gil Yohanan) \n \n The protest comes in response to a Jerusalem District Court ruling last month, whereby the Women of the Wall may conduct their pluralistic customs in the holy site. \n \n Knesset members Miri Regev (Likud ) and Tamar Zandberg (Meretz ) arrived on the scene. Zandberg described the scenes as \"tumultuous and exciting,\" saying those objecting to the female group's right to pray at the site have shown themselves to be seeking antagonism at any cost. \n \n Video courtesy of jn1.tv \n \n Deputy Jerusalem Mayor Isaac Pindar (United Torah Judaism) branded Women of the Wall \"the women of provocation.\" Pindar told Ynet the thousands of haredi women who came this morning to hold a mass prayer nearby were \"the true women of the wall.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n Police forces at the scene restraining a haredi man (photo: Gil Yohanan) \n \n Reform Movement CEO Rabbi Gilad Kariv, who also arrived at the site, said the leaders of the haredi public \"desecrated the sanctity\" of the Western Wall by calling on ultra-Orthodox to confront the Women of the Wall. \n \n The Rabbi of the Western Wall Shmuel Rabinovich said \"these pictures hurt the eye. The Jewish Torah should unify and I ask the Lord above to give everyone the wisdom to overcome the controversy.\" \n \n He added a compromise regarding the praying sectors at the site was achieved through a Supreme Court ruling over a decade ago, but \"a small group nevertheless decided to start the argument all over.\" \n \n The riot again brings to the fore the issue of religion\u2019s role \u2013 and the authority wielded by religious authorities associated with religious practice \u2013 in the modern State of Israel . In addition to being portrayed as the epicenter of Jewish prayer, the Western Wall is simultaneously a holy site and a site used for ceremonies such as soldiers\u2019 swearing-in ceremonies and other national activities. \n \n Until now, the site has been run in the manner of an Orthodox synagogue, with a high partition separating men\u2019s and women\u2019s prayer areas. Women coming to attend a bar mitzvah (a coming-of-age ceremony for boys at age 13) have had to climb up on chairs to peek over the partition in order to be part of the festivities. \n \n Women of the Wall's Catherine Leff, 17, whose father is a Conservative rabbi, said the events actually strengthened the group and encouraged the members to sing and pray even louder. She said that at some point the haredim began to spit at the women until police cleared them from the area. According to Leff, the bus which transported the Women of the Wall out of compound was pelted with huge stones, but no one was injured. \n \n Students enrolled in the Reform Movement's pre-military academy were also on hand to support the Women of the Wall. \"We arrived from Tel Aviv to show our support,\" one of them said. \"It is also a lesson in democracy, as there is no law that forbids women from praying in this manner.\" \n \n During the prayer, a woman approached the yeshiva students and yelled out \"Israel's chief rabbi will be a woman.\" She was immediately removed from the area by police. \n \n Yaakov, a 21-year-old haredi, said, \"What these women are doing is disgraceful and against the Torah. We will continue to fight them. A woman draped in a tallit (prayer shawl) is ridiculous. Jews do not act this way. I am willing to get arrested. Some things justify a violent reaction.\" ||||| Israeli soldiers stand still as a siren sounds nationwide during a ceremony marking Memorial Day at the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City April 14, 2013. \n \n JERUSALEM | \n \n JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Women seeking equal prayer rights at the Western Wall are planning a further challenge to Jewish Orthodox tradition at the site after a court ruling bolstered their cause, an activist said on Sunday. \n \n The Women of the Wall movement hopes to have its members read from a Torah (holy scriptures) scroll at the Jerusalem site, a ritual reserved under Orthodox practice for men only, when it holds its monthly prayer session there on May 10, according to Anat Hoffman, a leader of the group. \n \n The women have already broken with tradition in gatherings at the Western Wall, which is divided into separate men's and women's sections, by wearing prayer shawls that Orthodox law says only men should don. \n \n Israeli police, saying they were enforcing Supreme Court guidelines on keeping the peace and following local customs at the site, have routinely arrested women worshippers from the group during the prayer meetings. \n \n The protests have exposed a rift between Israel's government, which supports Orthodox practice at the Western Wall, and the U.S. Jewish Reform and Conservative movements, in whose synagogues men and women sit together. \n \n In a ruling that Women of the Wall called revolutionary, the Jerusalem District Court said on Thursday that customs change and women should not be arrested for wearing prayer shawls at the site. \n \n Women reading from the Torah at the Western Wall, revered as part of the Biblical Jewish Temple compound, could cause further friction with Orthodox worshippers. \n \n Earlier this month, an envoy appointed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seek a compromise over religious practices at the holy site proposed adding a mixed-gender section for non-Orthodox denominations of Judaism. \n \n Hoffman told Reuters she planned to meet with the envoy, former Israeli cabinet minister Natan Sharansky, on Monday. \n \n \"Then we will have a better understanding of what is on the table,\" she said. \n \n Sharansky has said the plan to convert an old archaeological dig south of the Western Wall into an area where men and women would be allowed to mix and worship freely would not entail structural damage around nearby al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third-holiest site. \n \n The sites came under Israel's control in the 1967 Middle East war when it captured East Jerusalem and the West Bank. \n \n (Reporting by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Angus MacSwan) ||||| Protests at the Western Wall in Jerusalem opposing the Women of the Wall prayer group ended on Friday morning with the arrest of three haredi men suspected of disturbing the peace. Two police officers who suffered light injuries during the unrest were treated at the scene. A large number of security forces at the holy site attempted to create a human barrier between the men and women's sections. \n \n \n \n Haredi protesters threw water bottles and other objects and shouted insults at the Women of the Wall activists, according to Israel Radio. \n \n \n \n \n \n The Jerusalem Post \n \n Post \n \n Rabbi Susan Silverman, comedian Sarah Silverman's sister who prays with the Women of the Wall, was at the protest where she said that haredi men spit globs of spit on her three daughters, she told. Silverman also said that the haredim threw coffee at the Women of the Wall activists and that a little girl next to her was hit in the head with something hard.Silverman told thethat the haredi protesters represent \"a fundamentalism and a belief in a single and very narrow view of God that I believe is idolatrous.\"Women of the Wall Spokesperson, Oshrat Ben Shimshon told Israel Radio, \"Orthodox rabbis have determined that there is no halachik barrier to women praying with prayer shawls and tefillin and reading from the Torah.\"Meanwhile, chairman of the Jewish Agency for Israel, Natan Sharansky said that a sustainable solution is urgent and this morning's clashes at the Western Wall dramatically reinforce Israel's need to allow any Jew, group of Jews or Jewish community to pray at the Western Wall according to their own customs.Sharansky praised police for the appropriate and level-headed action they have taken under extremely complicated circumstances, dealing with clashes and riots, and ensuring respect was given to those engaged in prayer.Several thousand yeshiva students and haredi school girls convened at the Western Wall plaza in Jerusalem to protest the monthly prayer service of the Women of the Wall.The protesters shouted at the Women of the Wall activists as they were conducting their first monthly service without restrictions after a court ruling two weeks ago reinterpreted existing laws and allowed them to be able to perform their own customs, such as wearing prayer shawls and tefillin, without fear of being arrested.The idea to send haredi school girls to protest the Women of the Wall was devised by MKs from the United Torah Judaism party earlier this week in consultation with principals of haredi girls schools, on condition the initiative received approval from the leading haredi rabbis.According to a report on haredi website Kikar Hashabbat, spiritual leader of the haredi world Rabbi Aharon Leib Shteinman gave his blessing to the proposal on Thursday.Many participants in the Women of the Wall services don prayer shawls and perform other customs usually performed by men in Orthodox practice, that has until now been prohibited by state law, and as of late, women have been arrested on a frequent basis for wearing prayer shawls during the WoW services. A court ruling two weeks ago reinterpreted existing laws and the Women of the Wall will on Friday be able to perform their own customs.At a hearing of the Knesset Committee on the Status of Women earlier this week, a representative of the Jerusalem Police confirmed that the police would not act against the recent Jerusalem District Court ruling which decided that WoW\u2019s customs did not contravene \u201clocal custom,\u201d that has been the basis for outlawing the group\u2019s non- Orthodox customs.United Torah Judaism MK Yisrael Eichler expressed outrage during the committee hearing at what he referred to as the Women of the Wall\u2019s \u201cprovocations.\u201d He asked if the police would allow the right of protest and demonstration against the group\u2019s prayer service.The Women of the Wall issued a statement on Thursday celebrating their new found freedoms.\u201cWe have the great merit that Israeli women will arrive in their masses tomorrow for the prayer service for the New Month of Sivan. We call on the public which supports us, women and men, to come and pray with us, to liberate the Western Wall and to turn it into to the home of everyone,\u201d the group said.",

Worst of all, he would go down in history as the man who lost to Ed Miliband. \n \n Launching his bid for another five years in Downing Street in an exclusive interview with The Mail on Sunday, Mr Cameron: \n \n Vows to \u2018hit the ground running and hard\u2019 if he is re-elected, introducing reforming legislation on education and welfare within the first 50 days. \n \n Warns German Chancellor Angela Merkel ahead of discussions this week on Britain\u2019s future in the EU that he is prepared to take Britain out of Europe, saying: \u2018If I don\u2019t get what is needed, I rule nothing out.\u2019 \n \n Is so close to the American President that Obama calls him \u2018bro\u2019. \n \n Reveals that he authorised the removal from the Tory candidates list of an aide to Home Secretary, and future leadership prospect Theresa May. \n \n Tells Boris Johnson that he will have to wait for a Cabinet seat. \n \n And claims that Labour\u2019s budget plans will cost \u00a313.5billion extra just in interest payments on the deficit, more than the police budget. \n \n As he surveys the green patchwork of fields and villages across the United Kingdom where he needs to win enough votes to avoid disaster, he says starkly: \u2018The choice is competence or chaos.\u2019 \n \n Drain duty aside, Cameron had a very merry Christmas. He cooked, went for bicycle rides and long walks (\u2018to run off the mince pies\u2019), played winter tennis with his son Elwyn on the court which Tony Blair had specially renovated, found Downton Abbey too long but watched a re-run of Out Of Africa with four-year-old daughter Florence falling asleep on his lap (\u2018nothing nicer in the world\u2019). \n \n There was only one major work interruption, a quick dash to London over ebola. After turkey at Chequers, it was home to Chipping Norton. \n \n As Father Christmas (he claims that all his children, even his ten-year-old daughter, still believe), he delivered stockings. \n \n \u2018We always, on Christmas morning, have the stockings opened all in our bed. It\u2019s my favourite hour of the year.\u2019 \n \n His gift from his wife Samantha was a casserole dish \u2013 \u2018we exchanged practical presents\u2019 \u2013 while he gave her the latest Nick Hornby, Funny Girl, before immediately borrowing it back. \n \n Scroll down for video \n \n Passionate: The Prime Minister, right, spells out his plan to to The Mail on Sunday editors Geordie Greig, left, and Glen Owen \n \n What has not changed is his quirky music sense.

Picture the PM in apron, stirring the beef bourguignon in time to a song called Cucurucu. \n \n A big change in the Cameron holidays this year was that he was also chief supervisor for the children\u2019s homework. He discovered the modern way of calculating long division and hated it. \n \n \u2018What was wrong with the old way?\u2019 he asks. It is clearly something his new Education Secretary Nicky Morgan may well be looking into. \n \n This is the most important Election for a generation, a real choice between continued competence or disaster David Cameron \n \n \u2018It\u2019s very confusing as suddenly your children look at you and say why are you doing it in a totally different way.\u2019 \n \n His Christmas reading was dominated by Do No Harm, a frank memoir by Henry Marsh, an outspoken brain surgeon, whose opening line is: \u2018I often have to cut into the brain and it is something I hate doing.\u2019 \n \n It is an intriguing choice, because the NHS is one of the main subject areas \u2013 Europe and the threat from Nigel Farage\u2019s Ukip are the others \u2013 which the PM appears reluctant to dwell on. \n \n The party\u2019s campaign chief, Lynton Crosby, has been emphatic in his advice to Mr Cameron: if the election is dominated by the economy, you will win. \n \n If it becomes mired in rows about Brussels, or protecting the NHS, Ed Miliband will enter Downing Street. \n \n Mr Cameron is on a plane to cover as much ground as possible in a day, taking in marginal seats in Cornwall and Yorkshire. \n \n Chancellor George Osborne meanwhile is campaigning against Vince Cable in Twickenham. \n \n Focused: The Prime Minister's election campaign is firmly concentrating on the economy \n \n Today, Mr Miliband unveils his predictable core strategy \u2013 that the NHS is not safe in Tory hands. \n \n The Battle for Britain has begun. Cameron passionately argues that the country\u2019s future prosperity has never been more at risk. \n \n His message is simple and he is sticking religiously to it: if Labour get in they will wreck the economy. \n \n \u2018This is the most important Election for a generation, a real choice between continued competence or disaster. \n \n 'This is all about security from the Conservatives and the chaos you\u2019d get from everybody else.

You get appalling insecurity, jobs lost, firms going overseas.\u2019 \n \n He is an extraordinarily assured politician, with a grasp of detail on everything from local planning in Cornwall to employment legislation in Yorkshire, allied to an almost messianic drive to win. \n \n Cameron said: \u2018Samantha is passionate about me continuing what I am doing. The Government has done a good job but it isn\u2019t finished' \n \n His confidence is particularly impressive given that he is in the fight of his political life. Even if he does defy the polls to win on May 7, Tory rebels are poised to strike \u2013either if the margin is so slim he is forced into another Coalition with the Lib Dems, or because he campaigns to stay in Europe on terms which the Tory Right find unacceptable. \n \n With his Old Etonian schoolfriend Boris Johnson on the brink of returning to Westminster, and growing speculation about the leadership ambitions of Mrs May, Tory MPs openly discuss the prospect of Mr Cameron stepping down halfway through the next Parliament after a victory. \n \n According to this theory, if the 2017 referendum on our membership of the EU goes against Mr Cameron, he would be forced to resign. But if he won, he would also think it was the right time to attempt to pass the leadership mantle to Mr Osborne. \n \n The Prime Minister says not: he is committed to serving a full, five-year second term. And if he wins in May, he will \u2018hit the ground running and hit it hard\u2019, legislating on school and welfare reforms within the first 50 days. \n \n He says he is fully backed by his wife. \u2018Samantha is passionate about me continuing what I am doing. The Government has done a good job but it isn\u2019t finished. We have to see it through, that is her strong view.\u2019 \n \n Mrs Cameron, the 43-year-old \u2018First Lady\u2019, is key to understanding the Prime Minister, who next year will celebrate his 20th wedding anniversary. \n \n When he lies awake in the middle of the night, worrying about whether to send in the special forces to rescue a hostage, she is the first person he turns to. \n \n \u2018She has very good judgment. I talk to Samantha about the most difficult decisions, life and death situations such as rescuing hostages or putting troops potentially in harm\u2019s way. You worry a lot. It is a very turbulent night when something like that is going to happen. \n \n \u2018There is a whole process in Cobra (the emergency committee) and listening to military advice, but in the end I make the decision.\u2019 \n \n He adds dotingly: \u2018If she\u2019d organised Napoleon\u2019s march on Moscow, they would have reached Vladivostok in good time. This year she did a lot of the Christmas shopping but I tried to make up for it with some cooking.\u2019 \n \n And the secret to their marriage? \n \n \u2018We love each other, that\u2019s a good start. We try not to go to bed on an argument and we spend time together and don\u2019t take it for granted.\u2019 \n \n The dreaded European issue will take centre stage next week when Cameron meets German Chancellor Angela Merkel in London \n \n THE PRIME MINISTER ON... \n \n Taking hostage-rescuing advice from Sam 'I talk to her about the most difficult decisions. There is a process in Cobra [but] she has very good judgment' Boris joining Cabinet after a victory in May 'Boris can do almost anything. I am sure there will be an opportunity... in time' His close relationship with Obama 'Yes, he sometimes calls me 'Bro' Gay weddings 'Lots of people have invited me. I\u2019m sure I will go to one soon' \n \n Last week saw the first gay marriages in Scotland and his legislation on the issue is something of which he is proud. \n \n Not that he has yet attended a gay wedding. \u2018Lots of people have invited me and sent me lovely letters saying if it wasn\u2019t for you, I wouldn\u2019t be able to marry the person I love. But I haven\u2019t been to one yet. I\u2019m sure I will soon.\u2019 \n \n So did he do it for libertarian reasons? \u2018No, I\u2019m not a libertarian. I believe in it as a man who believes in family and marriage. I don\u2019t see why gay people who love each other shouldn\u2019t be able to as well.\u2019 \n \n The dreaded European issue will take centre stage next week when Cameron meets German Chancellor Angela Merkel in London. \n \n She has made it clear she will not countenance any prospect of heeding reformist Tory calls to rip up the European Union\u2019s principle of freedom of movement to give the UK more power to block immigration from the rest of the EU. \n \n The Prime Minister has pledged that if EU leaders do not give Britain more control over certain policy areas \u2013 his so-called \u2018red lines\u2019 \u2013 then he will not tell the country to back continued membership of the EU in the 2017 vote. \n \n Merkel\u2019s agreement is essential to his \u2018red lines\u2019 and it will be on the table for their meeting. \u2018I am sure it will be part of our discussions,\u2019 he says. \n \n \u2018The most important thing of all is being able to make changes to the welfare system. The key areas are safeguarding the single market, getting out of ever closer union, being able to veto regulations and a package of measures on welfare. \n \n If you look at the reaction to my welfare speech in Germany and one or two European capitals, you will see they gave it a broad welcome. Germany wants Britain to stay in Europe.\u2019 Striking a defiant note, he declares: \u2018If I don\u2019t get what is needed, I rule nothing out.\u2019 \n \n Is it true that up to nine members of his Cabinet want to be free to campaign for an \u2018Out\u2019 vote in the referendum? \n \n \u2018That\u2019s news to me,\u2019 he insists. \n \n His relationship with Washington is less fraught. Obama rings and now calls him \u2018bro\u2019 \u2013 far better than George W Bush\u2019s patronising \u2018Yo, Blair\u2019. \n \n The leaders of the Right in the UK and the Left in the US found strong common ground. Like most Prime Ministers, he likes their approbation. \u2018The President has said the special relationship is stronger than it has ever been privately and in public and I agree.\u2019 \n \n Friends: Cameron said Obama rings and now calls him \u2018bro\u2019 \u2013 far better than George W Bush\u2019s patronising \u2018Yo, Blair\u2019 \n \n Unveiling the Tories\u2019 campaign poster in Halifax, Cameron is focused on the single message: It is all about the economy. He worries about Britain\u2019s fortunes going down the drain without DIY Dave and his team there to keep everything flowing. \n \n The big number he bandies about is the \u00a313.5 billion in extra interest. \n \n \u2018That is the difference between the two parties in what it would cost Britain if we went with Labour\u2019s plans. It\u2019s like going on a spending binge with a credit card and having absolutely no idea how you are going to meet the interest. That is what Labour are about. They have learnt absolutely nothing in the past five years. It\u2019s still more borrowing, more spending, more debt. That is totally unfair on future generations, let alone our own generation. I think its utterly irresponsible.\u2019 \n \n Cameron boasts of record employment and a responsible stewardship of the UK economy out of the disaster created by Labour overspending. But is he blue enough for the Tory heartland? \n \n \u2018Of course I am. I am a very instinctive Conservative. I have created a welfare system where it pays to work. I have created independent schools within the state sector bringing excellence to children wherever they are. Labour are na\u00efve in thinking they can build a stronger country on a whole lot of debt.\u2019 \n \n Cameron is careful to praise Boris Johnson as his Old Etonian schoolfriend is on the brink of returning to Westminster \n \n He is ready to roll out his plans for the first 50 days, new laws and incentives to roll back the frontiers of the state. But he will not be drawn on any specific so early in the Election race. \u2018On tax cuts, we have set out our plans that you should be able to earn \u00a312,500 before you pay any tax at all and you should be earning \u00a350,000 before you pay the 40p rate. We couldn\u2019t be clearer.\u2019 \n \n Several Ministers believe Cameron is yet to play his Election trump card, a cut or perhaps even the abolition of inheritance tax. If so, he is not showing his hand today. \n \n \u2018I want to go through the stages of people\u2019s lives \u2013 making sure they can get a job, cutting taxes so you keep more of your own money, more school places. That might sound prosaic but to me it is what politics is about, public service.\u2019 \n \n He remains fundamentally opposed to the state taking more than it needs of taxpayers\u2019 hard-earned money and he detests the idea of a wealth tax, or Mansion Tax as Labour calls it, which has so spectacularly backfired in France. \n \n \u2018That [tax] is alive and part of Ed Balls\u2019s plan for Britain. Having a homes tax like that is wrong. Extracting money from people every year in respect of the same asset is wrong. People have worked hard all their lives and put their money in this asset. This Government has done a lot to make sure wealthy foreigners pay their taxes. \n \n \u2018But if you want to be successful you have also got to make sure your country is attractive to invest in.\u2019 \n \n With some simmering signs of a potential leadership fight within the Tory ranks after the Election, Cameron is lightly dismissive. \n \n He is careful to praise Boris Johnson and Theresa May, but reveals that he authorised the removal last month of May\u2019s close aide Nick Timothy from the list of Tory candidates at the next Election for not campaigning for the party in the Rochester by-election. If selected, Mr Timothy would have been in prime position to run a May leadership bid. \n \n The fact about Boris is he can do almost anything, as I have discovered. What happens to him after the Election will have to be discussed \n \n \u2018We had to apply a rule fairly that everyone on a candidates list has to canvass in a by-election.\u2019 Was he consulted about Mr Timothy\u2019s removal? \u2018I am consulted about everything.\u2019 \n \n And he makes no promise of an early Cabinet seat for the London Mayor. \u2018The fact about Boris is he can do almost anything, as I have discovered. What happens to him after the Election will have to be discussed. He has an enormous talent. \n \n \u2018I\u2019m delighted he is coming back to the House. I hope I played a role in helping him do that. He is an absolute star. He wants to focus on being Mayor because he will be an MP and Mayor but I am sure in time there will be an opportunity for him to serve in other ways.\u2019 \n \n This Election is the first where social media will play a crucial role. On Friday, Cameron was asked to do more than a dozen selfies in as many minutes. \n \n \u2018The danger is everything becomes an obsession for five minutes, rather than getting to the heart of the issues,\u2019 says the man who famously posed for one at Nelson Mandela\u2019s funeral. \n \n Actually, he often grabs the cameras to expedite the selfie process and knows it is the best way to get his presence out beyond the traditional campaign trail. \n \n But it is the deficit and the spectre of Labour as debt gorgers to which he keeps returning for lasting effect. ||||| Barack Obama is so close to David Cameron that the US President calls him \"bro\", the Prime Minister has revealed. \n \n Speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Mr Cameron described the famously \u201cspecial\ufffd? relationship between Washington and Westminster as \u201cstronger than it has ever been, privately and in public,\ufffd? and that during phone calls Obama refers to him as \u201cbro\ufffd?. \n \n For those less well-versed in youth vernacular, the Urban Dictionary helpfully defines the term as describing \u201can alpha male idiot\ufffd? or \u201cobnoxious partying males often seen at college parties\ufffd?. \n \n \u201cBro\ufffd? may also describe a type of bra designed specifically for men. \n \n However, perhaps it should be assumed Obama uses it as a term of endearment, to mean close pals or \u201cbrothers\ufffd?. \n \n Either way, it can be seen as a step forward from George W Bush\u2019s condescending idiom: \u201cYo, Blair.\ufffd? \n \n As if we needed any more proof of the blossoming bromance, here are some pictures of the transatlantic \u201cbros\ufffd? looking all buddied-up.",

    "document": "Is sexual addiction the real deal? \n \n Nicole Prause \n \n Controversy exists over what some mental health experts call \"hypersexuality,\" or sexual \"addiction.\" Namely, is it a mental disorder at all, or something else? It failed to make the cut in the recently updated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-5, considered the bible for diagnosing mental disorders. Yet sex addiction has been blamed for ruining relationships, lives and careers. \n \n Now, for the first time, UCLA researchers have measured how the brain behaves in so-called hypersexual people who have problems regulating their viewing of sexual images. The study found that the brain response of these individuals to sexual images was not related in any way to the severity of their hypersexuality but was instead tied only to their level of sexual desire. \n \n In other words, hypersexuality did not appear to explain brain differences in sexual response any more than simply having a high libido, said senior author Nicole Prause, a researcher in the department of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA. \n \n \"Potentially, this is an important finding,\" Prause said. \"It is the first time scientists have studied the brain responses specifically of people who identify as having hypersexual problems.\" \n \n The study appears in the current online edition of the journal Socioaffective Neuroscience and Psychology. \n \n A diagnosis of hypersexuality or sexual addiction is typically associated with people who have sexual urges that feel out of control, who engage frequently in sexual behavior, who have suffered consequences such as divorce or economic ruin as a result of their behaviors, and who have a poor ability to reduce those behaviors. \n \n But, said Prause and her colleagues, such symptoms are not necessarily representative of an addiction \u2014 in fact, non-pathological, high sexual desire could also explain this cluster of problems. \n \n One way to tease out the difference is to measure the brain's response to sexual-image stimuli in individuals who acknowledge having sexual problems. If they indeed suffer from hypersexuality, or sexual addiction, their brain response to visual sexual stimuli could be expected be higher, in much the same way that the brains of cocaine addicts have been shown to react to images of the drug in other studies. \n \n The study involved 52 volunteers: 39 men and 13 women, ranging in age from 18 to 39, who reported having problems controlling their viewing of sexual images. They first filled out four questionnaires covering various topics, including sexual behaviors, sexual desire, sexual compulsions, and the possible negative cognitive and behavioral outcomes of sexual behavior. Participants had scores comparable to individuals seeking help for hypersexual problems. \n \n While viewing the images, the volunteers were monitored using electroencephalography (EEG), a non-invasive technique that measures brain waves, the electrical activity generated by neurons when they communicate with each other. Specifically, the researchers measured event-related potentials, brain responses that are the direct result of a specific cognitive event. \n \n \"The volunteers were shown a set of photographs that were carefully chosen to evoke pleasant or unpleasant feelings,\" Prause said. \"The pictures included images of dismembered bodies, people preparing food, people skiing \u2014 and, of course, sex. Some of the sexual images were romantic images, while others showed explicit intercourse between one man and one woman.\" \n \n The researchers were most interested in the response of the brain about 300 milliseconds after each picture appeared, commonly called the \"P300\" response. This basic measure has been used in hundreds of neuroscience studies internationally, including studies of addiction and impulsivity, Prause said. The P300 response is higher when a person notices something new or especially interesting to them. \n \n The researchers expected that P300 responses to the sexual images would correspond to a person's sexual desire level, as shown in previous studies. But they further predicted that P300 responses would relate to measures of hypersexuality. That is, in those whose problem regulating their viewing of sexual images could be characterized as an \"addiction,\" the P300 reaction to sexual images could be expected to spike. \n \n Instead, the researchers found that the P300 response was not related to hypersexual measurements at all; there were no spikes or decreases tied to the severity of participants' hypersexuality. So while there has been much speculation about the effect of sexual addiction or hypersexuality in the brain, the study provided no evidence to support any difference, Prause said. \n \n \"The brain's response to sexual pictures was not predicted by any of the three questionnaire measures of hypersexuality,\" she said. \"Brain response was only related to the measure of sexual desire. In other words, hypersexuality does not appear to explain brain responses to sexual images any more than just having a high libido.\" \n \n But debate continues over whether sex addiction is indeed an addiction. A study published in 2012 by Prause's colleague Rory Reid, a UCLA assistant professor of psychiatry, supported the reliability of the proposed DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for hypersexual disorder. However, Prause notes, that study was not focused on the validity of sex addiction or impulsivity, and did not use any biophysiological data in the analysis. \n \n \"If our study can be replicated,\" she said, \"these findings would represent a major challenge to existing theories of a sex 'addiction.' \" \n \n Other authors on the study included Dr. Timothy Fong, associate professor of psychiatry at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA and director of the UCLA Impulse Control Disorders Clinic; Vaughn R. Steele of the University of New Mexico; and Cameron Staley of Idaho State University. Funding was provided by an Idaho State University Graduate Student Committee grant (Staley). \n \n The UCLA Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences is the home within the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA for faculty who are experts in the origins and treatment of disorders of complex human behavior. The department is part of the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA, a world-leading interdisciplinary research and education institute devoted to the understanding of complex human behavior and the causes and consequences of neuropsychiatric disorders. ||||| Photos by Andy Lyons/Getty Images, Andrew Kelly/Reuters, Vincent Kessler/Reuters, and Caroline McCredie/Getty Images \n \n Does sex addiction really exist? A new study published in last week\u2019s journal of Socioaffective Neuroscience and Psychology suggests that maybe it doesn\u2019t\u2014bad news for celebrities like Tiger Woods and Russell Brand who have made it trendy in recent years to claim a clinical addiction to sex as an explanation for sexual misbehavior. \n \n The study (which, amazingly, is the first of its kind) measured how the brains of people who struggle with sexually compulsive behavior respond to sexual images. If sex can be addictive in the clinical sense, scientists theorized, then the neural response of sex addicts to pornography should mimic the neural responses of drug or alcohol addicts to their drugs of choice. Instead, researchers found that hypersexual brains don\u2019t react in the same way as other addicts\u2019 brains\u2014in fact, the neural responses to pornography only varied based on levels of sexual libido, rather than on measures of sexual compulsivity. People with higher libidos had more active brain reactions to the sexual images than people with lower libidos, but that was the only correlation. Degrees of sexual compulsivity did not predict brain response at all. If the results of this first study can be replicated, it would represent a major challenge to the notion that sex and pornography can be literally addictive. \n \n \u201cThis is controversial territory because it represents a substantial shift in the way we view mental illness,\u201d Dr. Nicole Prause, an assistant research scientist in the department of psychiatry at UCLA and one of the investigators involved with the study, told me. \u201cMost people describe high-frequency sexual problems as an \u2018addiction\u2019\u2014that\u2019s how the public and even many clinicians talk about it. But this data challenges the addiction model and forces us to reconsider how we think and talk about these problems.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n For the study, researchers recruited 52 people (39 men and 13 women) who reported having difficulties controlling their use of pornography and used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure their brain responses to various images. Some images were sexual in nature, such as kissing, nudity, and penetrative sex, while others were designed to be neutral or even unpleasant, such as pictures of skiers and dismembered bodies. Researchers analyzed brain response to the pictures in the first 300 milliseconds after the images appeared, commonly called a \u201cP300.\u201d Hundreds of neuroscience studies have relied on P300 measurements to analyze the brain\u2019s response to various stimuli; for example, Prause said, several studies of substance addicts found increased P300 responses to images of their drugs of choice as compared to neutral images. \n \n \u201cWe expected the brain response to sexual stimuli to be consistent with other drugs of addiction, or even other behavioral addiction studies,\u201d said Prause. \u201cBut we just don\u2019t see that at all. We weren\u2019t able to find evidence for any relationship between the measures of high-frequency sexual problems and the brain response to sexual images.\u201d \n \n In a 2010 Psychology Today blog post, Dr. Michael Bader provocatively argued that \u201cthe addiction made me do it\u201d is merely an excuse for people who want to avoid the difficult psychological thought and introspection required to address the real issues behind sexually compulsive behavior. Now this study has reignited the ongoing debate about whether sex and other so-called behavioral addictions\u2014also known as process addictions, such as shopping and tanning\u2014should be considered pathological alongside substance addictions such as nicotine, alcohol, and drugs. The third edition of the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, released in 1987, included the term \u201csex addiction\u201d under the category \u201cSexual Disorder\u2014Not Otherwise Specified,\u201d but that term was removed in subsequent editions. Hypersexual disorder was considered for inclusion in the recently released DSM-5 but was removed by the final draft. \n \n So here\u2019s where we stand: Despite the familiarity of sex addiction in pop culture, hypersexual disorder is not an officially categorized diagnosis\u2014and studies like this suggest that won\u2019t change anytime soon. Nevertheless, mental health professionals around the world have reported patients who come to them seeking help with sexually compulsive behavior. So a problem does exist, and people who want treatment and support deserve access to it. But the debate about sex addiction underlines important questions about how psychiatrists should categorize the difference between a clinical mental illness that can be demonstrated in a lab, such as substance addiction, and other forms of mental distress, which deserve equal care and compassion but don\u2019t necessarily indicate a medical mental illness. If we turn every single quirk of human sexuality into a \u201cdisease,\u201d after all, then we\u2019re all screwed. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n \u201cWe don't have a lot of information about what constitutes normative sexual behavior, so how can we conclusively determine what is deviant?\u201d said Dr. Rory Reid, a neuropsychologist at UCLA and the principal investigator for the DSM-5 field trial on hypersexual disorder. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is enough evidence to conclude that patterns of hypersexual behavior constitute a bona fide disorder in the scientific realm, but we also don\u2019t have enough evidence to dismiss that possibility. It certainly warrants further research and discussion.\u201d \n \n Dr. Eli Coleman, who directs the program in human sexuality at the University of Minnesota Medical School, argues that any study that looks at compulsive sexual behavior from a traditional addiction model may be missing the mark. \n \n \u201cOne of the big problems with the term \u2018sex addiction\u2019 is that it immediately assumes that you can apply the same kinds of research methodologies and treatments that you would use for substance addiction,\u201d said Coleman. \u201cThere are no sex receptors in the brain to develop tolerance and dependence, as there are with alcohol and drug addiction.\u201d Hypersexuals don\u2019t experience seizures or other physical symptoms of withdrawal when they abstain, for example, like alcohol and drug addicts do. Coleman suggests that for many people, hypersexual behavior seems to be a problem of impulse control or compulsive drive rather than a neural addiction. But, he added, even that explanation is probably too simplistic: Some people use sexual behavior to modulate mood states, and in others hypersexuality looks almost like attention deficit disorder. \u201cIt\u2019s really very complex,\u201d said Coleman. \u201cAnd there has not been enough research to fully examine all of the underlying mechanisms.\u201d \n \n Previous investigations into sex addiction have only measured the brains of sexual compulsives at rest (that is, without exposure to sexual imagery) or relied entirely on self-reported questionnaires, which are likely to be influenced by social ideas about what constitutes \u201cnormal\u201d degrees of sexual behavior or desire. This new study is the first time that scientists have measured the active responses of hypersexual brains to sexual stimuli, which seems closer to the mark if scientists want to prove or dispel the clinical case for sex addiction. \n \n \u201cThe field is very strange, because experimental work is very rare in this area. Many people report feeling out of control sexually, but when we actually look for evidence of that in a lab, we can\u2019t find it,\u201d said Prause. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m aghast that we\u2019re not doing more research in this area. Questionnaires are valuable, but we need to do more work to determine if what people are reporting is actually true.\u201d \n \n Prause points out why there haven\u2019t been funds directed toward scientific research that might challenge the existence of sex addiction: If something is a disease, there is money to be made from treating it. (One Christian organization, for example, charges $1,275 for a three-day seminar called \u201cEvery Man\u2019s Battle\u201d that claims to treat men who \u201cfind themselves pulled into the use of pornography\u201d or who \u201cseek out sexual gratification through compulsive masturbation.\u201d)",

Whatever killed them happened so suddenly that they never made a run for the escape hatch. What's more, they had no obvious physical injuries. \n \n There was no major damage to the hull that could be definitively traced back to the day the H.L. Hunley, a 40-foot-long Confederate submarine, sank to the ocean floor off Charleston, South Carolina, on February 17, 1864. \n \n Researchers had unsealed the crew compartment of the submarine, but they have yet to find conclusive evidence of how the eight men aboard died. \n \n But in research published Wednesday in the journal Plos One one group of scientists thinks they've finally cracked the case of what killed the crew so swiftly. \n \n Shrinking down, blowing up \n \n The Hunley became the first sub to sink an enemy ship in battle: the USS Housatonic. But sometime after, it went down, too. \n \n It sank the enemy ship with a 135-pound torpedo, which was filled with black powder and attached to a pole 16 feet from the ship's hull. The study authors say the torpedo is the key -- but many have wondered how an explosion could've killed the entire crew without leaving a trace. \n \n Rachel Lance set off explosions near a miniature replica of a Civil War submarine. \n \n To answer this question, biomechanist Rachel Lance designed a model of the Hunley, one-sixth the length of the 40-foot-long submarine. The model, built by Durham-based sculptor Tripp Jarvis, was christened the CSS Tiny. \n \n Lance, then a graduate student at Duke University and an engineer with the Naval Surface Warfare Center , decided she would set off test explosions next to the model submarine. So she found an eight-acre pond on a family-run farm in St. Louis, North Carolina. Bert Pitt of Pitt Family Farms agreed to let Lance use the pond to conduct her experiments. \n \n \"Initially, when she was talking about blasting, I was a little concerned,\" said Pitt, 65, a sixth-generation family farmer, whose grandchildren now make eight generations. \n \n Pitt recalled the wires snaking into the lake and the charges that detonated beneath the surface, splashing water into the air like a large firecracker, he said. One of his grandkids got to press the button. \n \n \"It had a little geyser to it,\" he said. \"It was neat to see.\" \n \n Pitt, a self-proclaimed history buff, had always been interested in the Civil War. He has ancestors who were in the North Carolina Regiments, and at least one of them is buried in their own family graveyard. The house he lives in was built in 1830, before the Hunley sank. \n \n He keenly eyed reports about the Hunley on the History Channel and the National Geographic Channel. \n \n \"They were sitting perfectly still in that submarine,\" Pitt said. \"I think people would like to know what did happen to the crew. Everything about the story is intriguing.\" \n \n Without a trace \n \n Suspended inside the CSS Tiny was a small pressure gauge, which revealed how the sub's own torpedo blast could have killed the Hunley crew without leaving a lasting mark: the shock wave created by the blast. \n \n The shock wave hit the Hunley's hull, which was less than an inch thick, said Lance, lead author of the new study. The metal bent ever so slightly but fast enough to transfer the blast wave to the inside of the cabin. \n \n That wave then traveled through the cabin, hitting each of the eight crewmembers, traveling through their bodies. But the real damage, Lance said, probably occurred when the pressure wave reached their lungs. \n \n \"The issue is when it's passing through (the tissues) and it suddenly hits air,\" she said. \n \n Shock waves, like sound waves, travel quickly in water and solids but not air. The wave slows as it hits the lung, Lance said, and \"that energy has to transmit somewhere.\" \n \n The end result: The blood vessels in the lungs can rupture, known as a pulmonary hemorrhage. \n \n \"It was ... noted that men could be killed or disabled at considerable distance\" from an explosive, Dr. Thomas Chiffelle, a pathologist from Albuquerque, New Mexico, wrote in a 1966 report for the US Department of Defense. \"The man or animal may be killed outright, without external signs of injury, but often with blood-tinged froth or frank blood appearing in the nose and mouth.\" \n \n It is possible to survive a blast wave from far enough, according to Chiffelle's accounts. Witness accounts from the night of the Hunley's sinking claimed that there was a blue light coming from the ocean. Some speculated that it was the Hunley crew signaling that they'd accomplished their mission. \n \n Photos: Delving into mysteries of submarine H.L. Hunley Confederate submarine H. L.

The blast can also change with how tightly the powder is packed and how fine the grains are, according to the Naval History and Heritage Command. Replicating the black powder explosion, Lance said, was the trickiest part of the experiment. \n \n So Lance lowballed it, testing several blasts in the process. She concluded that the shock wave would have instantly killed those aboard the Hunley, based on her calculations and a wealth of prior air blast experiments on large animals. \n \n \"Any explosive we've seen in the field ... would definitely create a lethal wave,\" Lance said. \n \n \"These types of injuries are not subtle,\" she added. \"The damage is immediate.\" \n \n Tick tock \n \n There was another piece of evidence that stood in her favor: a gold pocket watch that belonged to the Hunley's captain, Lt. George Dixon. \n \n The watch had stopped at 8:23, about the time of the Hunley's attack, historians believe. \n \n \"Most importantly, it appears it didn't wind down naturally,\" according to a 2007 update by a research partnership known as the Hunley Project. \"Something traumatic -- perhaps water, a shock wave, or some other intervening force -- caused it to stop at that precise time.\" \n \n Friends of the Hunley -- part of the Hunley Project, which was not involved in the new research -- declined to comment on the research.

Hunley made history by becoming the first combat submarine to sink an enemy ship. The Confederate crew never returned from its mission, sparking a mystery that\u2019s lasted for over 130 years. An exhaustive new analysis suggests these pioneering submariners didn\u2019t drown or suffocate as commonly believed, but instead died from the shockwave triggered by their very own weapon. \n \n The eight-man crew of the 40-foot Confederate submarine H.L. Hunley died instantly when its powerful barrel torpedo exploded into the hull of the 1,200-ton Union warship USS Housatonic, according to new research published today in PLoS One. Duke University biomechanist Rachel Lance\u2019s exhaustive, three-year investigation suggests the explosion caused minimal damage to the sub, which was less than 20 feet away, but the ensuing shockwave caused catastrophic injuries to the crewmen\u2019s soft tissues, especially to their brains and lungs. The finding subsequently fills in an important gap in US Civil War history, while offering fresh insights into human physiology and the physical forces we\u2019re able\u2014or unable\u2014to endure. \n \n Advertisement \n \n On the evening of February 17, 1864, the H.L. Hunley, commanded by Charles Pickering, embarked on what would be its first and final combat mission. As part of the Confederate campaign to dismantle the stifling Unionist naval blockade, the sub\u2019s crew managed to sink the USS Housatonic with a submersible barrel bomb. \n \n This \u201ctorpedo\u201d wasn\u2019t a self-propelled bomb in the conventional sense. Rather, it was a copper keg filled with 135 pounds of black powder that was positioned slightly ahead and below the sub\u2019s bow at the tip of a 16-foot pole known as a spar. The crew plunged this bomb into the Housatonic\u2019s hull just below the waterline, causing a tremendous explosion. The Union warship sunk in just five minutes, killing five of her crew. The ship came to rest upright in 30 feet of water, allowing the remaining seamen to be rescued. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The mission may have been a success, but the crew of H.L. Hunley was never heard from again. Its fate was finally revealed in 1995 when the sunken sub was found a mere 300 meters from the wreck of the Housatonic near Charleston Harbor in South Carolina. The sub was raised in 2000, and it has been under investigation by Clemson University scientists ever since. \n \n \n \n But while the sub\u2019s fate was finally revealed, it still wasn\u2019t clear what transpired during the military engagement, and what led to the death of its eight seamen. Historians have speculated that the Hunley crew drowned or suffocated, or that shear forces broke a valve causing the sub to sink\u2014or even that the H.L. Hunley was shot by a seaman aboard the doomed Housatonic. \n \n Advertisement \n \n But none of these explanations fit the evidence. Confusingly, the crewmen\u2019s skeletons were all found at their hand-crank stations, which were used to manually propel the craft. They exhibited no broken bones, the drain pumps were closed, as were the air hatches. The sub was startlingly intact, the only noticeable blemishes being a hole in one conning tower and an apparently broken window. The only satisfactory explanation, argues Lance, is that the crew was killed instantly by the shockwave generated from the barrel bomb explosion. \n \n To prove her case, Lance constructed a 6-1/2-foot scale model of the sub and subjected it to pressurized air blasts and black powder explosions while monitoring the effects with a series of onboard sensors. With the help of a Civil War reenactor and his fully functional, historically accurate rifle, she shot at period-accurate iron plating meant to mimic the sub\u2019s hull. She analyzed the effects of energy blasts onto the human respiratory system, pored through documents at the National Archives in Washington, interviewed an ATF explosives expert, and even visited an original black powder mill. The whole endeavour took about three years, but the results are compelling. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Lance\u2019s conclusion is that all crew members died instantly from the tremendous force of the explosion. The ensuing shockwave travelled through the soft tissues of seamen\u2019s bodies, especially their lungs and brains. \n \n Normally, a shockwave of this strength would travel at a rate of 340 meters per second (m/s) through the open air, but underwater it accelerates to 1,500 m/s. By the time this shockwave hit the sub and penetrated the crewmen\u2019s skin (the distance to the explosion varied for each crew member, ranging from 18 to 42 feet depending on where they were positioned in the sub), it slowed down to 30 m/s, which was still enough to cause catastrophic physical damage. Each seaman was subjected to about 60 milliseconds of shockwave trauma, as compared to about 10 milliseconds had the men been exposed above water. Lance assesses the probably of this happening to each crew member at about 85 percent. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \u201cInjuries and fatalities from blasts occur instantaneously,\u201d Lance told Gizmodo. \u201cSince we calculated the blast exposure levels to be in the lethal range, the crew probably did not even have time to realize what occurred. They would have known they were approaching the Housatonic and preparing to attack, but once the torpedo exploded they would have suffered fatal pulmonary and brain traumas before they processed that their attack had been successful.\u201d \n \n \n \n This cause of death would have left no mark on the skeletal remains. The soft tissues, which would have shown what happened, are long gone. But in addition to this shockwave analysis, other evidence exists to show that the men died instantly. Had they survived the blast, the crewmembers would\u2019ve tried to release the keel ballast weights, start pumping water, or make an effort to escape the sub\u2014but it appears none of these actions were taken. \n \n \n \n Lance says these findings hold dual significance. \n \n \u201cAs an injury biomechanist it is a fascinating example of a completely unprecedented injury mechanism,\u201d she said. \u201cThe physiology of human beings has not really changed in the past 150 years with the exception of better nutrition, so humans in 2017 still have the same physical vulnerabilities as in 1864. Therefore the Hunley, even though it is a historical case, provides insight into our own physiology that is still applicable to us today. Historical case studies are incredibly important to injury biomechanists because they often present unique scenarios that are unlikely to occur in modern times.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n For Lance, the other important aspect of this work was finally being able to solve an enduring maritime mystery. \n \n \u201cThe mystery of the Hunley has been one of the big question marks of history since it disappeared in 1864,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile the archaeologists of Clemson did the majority of the heavy lifting with their conservation work, it has been a real honor to be able to contribute my expertise to help finally answer the question.\u201d \n \n [PLoS One] ||||| The submarine H.L. Hunley was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship during combat; however, the cause of its sinking has been a mystery for over 150 years. The Hunley set off a 61.2 kg (135 lb) black powder torpedo at a distance less than 5 m (16 ft) off its bow. Scaled experiments were performed that measured black powder and shock tube explosions underwater and propagation of blasts through a model ship hull. This propagation data was used in combination with archival experimental data to evaluate the risk to the crew from their own torpedo. The blast produced likely caused flexion of the ship hull to transmit the blast wave; the secondary wave transmitted inside the crew compartment was of sufficient magnitude that the calculated chances of survival were less than 16% for each crew member. The submarine drifted to its resting place after the crew died of air blast trauma within the hull. \n \n Funding: We would like to gratefully acknowledge funding and support from the Josiah Charles Trent Memorial Foundation Endowment Fund at Duke University for directly funding this research.

Primary injuries from blast predominantly affect the gas-filled organs, most often causing pulmonary trauma such as hemorrhaging, but can also present as traumatic brain injuries [ 36 , 37 ]. These injury types would not be evident from skeletal or highly decomposed remains. \n \n TNT is conventionally used as a yardstick to compare the strengths of different explosives, both low and high, which are typically described by stating their TNT relative equivalency (RE) [ 33 ]. RE is a fractional number that describes the strength of an explosive relative to the strength of TNT. Most explosives have RE values in the range 0.8\u20131.2 [ 33 , 34 ]. \n \n Black powder is a low explosive, a volatile blend of crushed charcoal, sulfur, and either sodium or potassium nitrate [ 28 ]. Unlike high explosives, which have burn rates faster than the speed of sound, black powder deflagrates rather than detonates. Variables such as grain size, powder density, and even the type of wood used to make the charcoal can potentially have noticeable effects on powder performance because of their impact on burn rate [ 29 \u2013 31 ]. Tests of modern black powder have shown comparable performance in both burn rate and pressures produced to cannon-grade Union powder from the Civil War [ 29 ]. Black powder performance is also highly dependent upon the strength with which it is confined [ 30 ]. When it is spread on the ground and lit in an open, unconfined environment it burns with negligible pressure generation; however, when it is confined the charge casing allows the gradual generation of internal pressure until the point of casing failure [ 32 ]. While it is categorized as a low explosive, the data presented in this study show that it is capable of generating a sharp-rising pressure wave with certain confinement conditions. \n \n Momentum transfer into a structure produces motion of that structure, and rapid initiation of motion can create a shock wave off the structure\u2019s back surface [ 22 , 25 , 26 ]. Transmitted blast waves have been observed computationally behind structures and experimentally measured behind armor [ 22 , 27 ]. Computational simulations confirm that backface pressure response is the product of rapid motion of the structure wall in response to the original external blast, and because the motion response of the structure increases for stronger blasts, so will the magnitude of the transmitted blast [ 22 , 25 ]. Such a backface wave means that, even if the original blast wave is largely reflected at the front material interface of the structure, it is possible that people behind the structure could still be injured or killed by transmitted shock from a sufficiently large charge at a sufficiently close range without overt damage to the structure. \n \n Blast interactions with structures can be prohibitively complex to test experimentally, so these tests are often performed both in air and in water by scaling down the size of the experiment according to the relevant dimensionless parameters [ 17 , 22 ]. G.I. Taylor first described the pi groups that dictate the behavior of an underwater blast wave hitting a solid structure with air behind that structure, primarily in an attempt to predict damage to ships from TNT depth charges [ 23 ]. Taylor\u2019s dimensional analysis and subsequent studies by other groups concluded that the amount of momentum transferred into a structure by a blast wave can be scaled by size if the time-relevant parameters of the blast wave are also scaled [ 22 , 23 ]. Dimensionless parameters dictating the amount of momentum transferred are shown as Eqs ( 3 ) & ( 4 ). \n \n The increase in both the density and the speed of sound in water means that when explosions occur underwater, the resulting shock and pressure waves travel more efficiently and further than they do in air [ 17 , 18 ]. The most critical behaviors of underwater shock waves follow traditional scaling laws since peak overpressure, duration, and impulse scale with the overall length scale of the experiment [ 17 , 19 ]. However, it is more informative and convenient to describe the output of the charge via the equations provided by Hopkinson scaling, also referred to as the principle of similitude [ 20 ]. The Hopkinson scaling equations for peak pressure and time constant for underwater blast are shown as Eqs ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) [ 17 , 21 ]. \n \n Both of two previous primary theories of sinking, suffocation and damage to the hull from arms fire, have been found to be implausible in recent publications [ 15 , 16 ]. In addition, evaluation of the attack showed that the Hunley likely drifted before finally sinking [ 16 ]. \n \n The two large holes discovered in the bow and side of the hull were determined not to be the cause of sinking by analysis of the sediment layers within, which showed that both breaches occurred long after the sinking, and no additional damage was found to the hull that provided an explanation. The holes were determined to have occurred at a later date because analysis of the types and quantity of sedimentary materials, including marine macrofauna, showed strata of sediment deposition that permitted analysis of the general patterns of sediment accumulation over time within the hull [ 13 ]. These strata indicated that the holes were not present during the vessel\u2019s initial time underwater. The pattern of damage of the holes was determined to have been caused by a combination of galvanic corrosion, stresses from riveted seams, and erosion from ocean currents [ 14 ]. \n \n The Hunley was raised from the ocean floor in 2000, and conservation efforts have been ongoing since [ 5 , 6 ]. The skeletal remains of the crewmembers were found seated at their respective stations, with no physical injuries or apparent attempts to escape [ 7 \u2013 9 ]. The conning towers, which formed the only path of escape, were closed with the aft tower still securely locked [ 10 ]. The bilge pumps were not set to pump out water [ 11 ]. The keel ballast weights, which could be released from within the boat, remained firmly attached [ 1 , 12 ]. \n \n The vessel\u2019s commander could see out the fore conning tower and was responsible for navigation, while the remaining crewmen powered the vessel\u2019s propeller from the inside using a hand crank [ 2 , 3 ]. At the other end of a hinged 16-foot spar was firmly bolted the Hunley\u2019s torpedo, a copper torpedo of the common Singer\u2019s design type filled with 61.2 kg (135 lbs) of black powder and fitted with a pressure-sensitive trigger ( S1 Fig )[ 4 ]. \n \n The Hunley sank the Union ship Housatonic and killed 5 Union soldiers by setting off a black powder torpedo against the ship\u2019s hull on the evening of February 17, 1864. The narrow, tapered submarine was 12 m (40 ft) long with a maximum width of only 1.2 m (4 ft) [ 1 ]. It was shaped out of the wrought iron boiler of a previous ship, and carried a crew of 8 men ( Fig 1 ). \n \n Methods \n \n Scale model construction A 1/6 length-scaled model of the HL Hunley was constructed out of 16-gauge mild steel, which is materially similar to the wrought iron of the submarine\u2019s hull in many properties including those that dictate structural response to blast exposure (S1 Table) [14, 38, 39]. Key physical design properties of the Hunley were incorporated in the scale model construction, including ballast tanks that could be filled with water and ballast weighting by lining the keel with lead. Information about the methods used to obtain the measurements of the Hunley that formed the basis of the scale model can be found in Ref [15]. The finished model is shown in Fig 2.

For each exposure type, an omnidirectional incident pressure gauge was suspended in the center of the interior of the hull. An identical pressure gauge was also suspended in the water external to the boat, at the centerline along the length of the boat and at a distance of 6 cm horizontal standoff from the side of the hull. The gauges used were oil-filled tourmaline gauges validated for measurement of underwater and air blasts (Naval Surface Warfare Center Carderock Division, Bethesda, MD), amplified with a PCB Piezotronics 402A amplifier and powered with PCB Piezotronics model 482A10 and model 482 power supplies (PCB Piezotronics, Inc., Depew, NY). The gauge cables were foam-covered and insulated along the length of the cable between the boat and the pier. Data acquisition was performed at 1 MHz rate with 500 kHz antialiasing filters using a Hi-Techniques MeDAQ Win600e (Hi-Techniques Inc., Madison, WI). The experiment was scaled so that the degree of pressure transmission into the scaled model hull would be similar to the degree of pressure transmission into the full-sized Hunley [17, 19, 21, 40\u201342]. Some changes, such as the change in density from salt to fresh water, were experimentally unavoidable, but the effects are expected to be small (differences in density and bulk modulus increase the speed of sound in salt water 2\u20134% over that in freshwater). \n \n Shock tube blasts The shock tube exposures were performed in the Duke University Reclamation Pond. The shock tube was composed of a driver section only, made of size 3 high-pressure stainless steel pipe flanges, fitted with a variable number of Mylar membranes (S2 Fig). The shock tube driver was braced from behind with water-saturated wooden rails and pressurized with helium until the Mylar membranes ruptured, creating a shock wave. A live charge creates spherically expanding shock waves, so because the Hunley\u2019s spar held the torpedo at a downward angle the Hunley would have been directly exposed from all sides along the entire length of its hull. Since shock tubes create highly directional shock waves rather than spherical shock waves like those produced by live charges, the shock tube was used to characterize which sections of the hull were responsible for transmitting the effects of blast. The characterization was performed by directing the shock tube at the bow of the vessel, at the side of the vessel, at the vessel\u2019s keel, and at oblique angles relative to the axis of the hull. Once it was determined that the bow of the vessel transmitted negligible blast effects into the main cabin, and the perpendicular component of the blast was responsible for blast transmission into the cabin, the transmission tests were performed by directing the shock tube perpendicularly at the side of the hull. The external pressures were estimated to be the perpendicular component of a blast with the correct direction of propagation, and so were divided by sin(11\u00b0) to calculate the overall peak pressure values of the estimated blast [43]. \n \n Live charge blasts The test site for the live charges was a freshwater pond with a bottom depth slightly greater than the scaled value (9 m/6 = 1.3 m) of the bottom depth at the location of the Hunley attack on the Housatonic [44]. This depth would ensure that reflections of the blast waveform off the bottom would be equal to or less than those experienced by the Hunley, and so would either approximate the amount of bottom reflection or err on the low side since bottom reflections augment the strength of an underwater blast exposure [17]. All necessary permits and legal permissions were obtained prior to each round of testing. Charges were packed with 4Fg black powder (Goex Powder, Inc., Minden, LA) with casings constructed out of schedule 80 PVC pipe with threaded end caps. The historical drawing of the Hunley torpedo indicates that it was filled with grade FF cannon powder (S1 Fig). However, samples of powder from recently uncovered Union cannonballs from the Civil War indicate that the historic FF grain size more accurately matches the modern 4F grain size standard for musket powder [29]. The charges were triggered using NPb squibs (Martinez Specialties, Groton, NY). Isolated squibs were set off to evaluate their detonation signatures at the distances of interest, but were determined not to have a noticeable impact on the pressure waveforms. Several preliminary underwater tests were conducted with variations in charge size, casing construction, and range to the point of measurement to assess black powder\u2019s performance with respect to the scaling of time constant for the non-dimensional groups. Charge size was varied, with sizes of 283 g, 455 g, 490 g, and 1 kg, and range between the charge and the point of measurement was varied between 80 cm and 1.8 m. The range values were selected to validate the scaling principles in the regions most relevant to the Hunley. Initial testing showed that orientation and position of the charge relative to the gauges had a measurable effect on the pressure waveforms. Therefore, test data were only used for the analysis of scaling if they had the same charge orientation and depth as the tests with the scale boat model, and gauge locations that would fall along the length of the submarine hull. Specifically, the tests evaluating the effects of confinement strength were eliminated from the scaling data set because the measurements were taken at the same depth as the charges. The initial time constant of decay (\u03b8) was measured for all blasts. Theta was scaled using Hopkinson scaling by division by the cube root of charge weight (W1/3) (Eq (2)). This value was then plotted as a function of the scaled distance (W1/3/Range) at which the waveform was measured. A power law equation was fitted to the data in the scaling data set using least-squares regression. This method is the standard procedure for describing the time-scaling behavior of explosives and is referred to as the principle of shock wave similitude [17, 21]. The Tiny model was blasted with black powder charges of three sizes: 283 g and 455 g charges, corresponding to 1/6 and 1/5 size scale of the 61.4 kg (135 lb) Hunley torpedo, and 1 kg charges, which were the maximum size as requested by the ATF. While 283 g is the properly mass-scaled value for black powder, the larger charge sizes were constructed to evaluate the degree of propagation of higher pressures through the hull wall. Experimental limitations on scaling burn rate of the powder and methods of charge confinement meant that the PVC 283 g charges would severely underestimate the strength of the exposure compared to the original copper-cased torpedo; larger charges were therefore also tested to evaluate how the transmission properties changed with increases in external pressure. All charges except one were attached via a size-scaled spar to position them in the same manner as the Hunley\u2019s torpedo. One 283 g charge was positioned beside the boat to further increase external pressure of exposure. The external pressure from this charge was divided by the sine of the angle between the direction of blast propagation and horizontal at the centerline of the keel (11\u00b0) to calculate the total external peak pressure from a spar-mounted charge that would have the same amount of propagation through the hull. This angular correction for direction of transmission is often used in structural shock testing for charges in different geometric orientations from their targets [43]. \n \n Shock tube blasting of metal plate Propagation of a sharp-rising shock wave through the full-sized Hunley structure was investigated using a mild steel plate with greater thickness (1.6 cm, 5/8\u201d) than the original Hunley hull (1.0 cm, 3/8\u201d). The purpose of this test was to ensure that the shock wave maintained the sharp rise time critical to cause injuries even when propagating through a material at least the thickness of the full-sized submarine hull. The steel plate was a square 61 cm (24\u201d) on each side and was exposed to airblast using a helium-driven shock tube. The shock tube was 30.5 cm (12\u201d) in diameter and was aimed at the center of the plate. A standoff distance of 4 cm was set between the plate and the end of the tube to allow lateral venting of the shock and provide reduced impulse on the plate relative to peak incident pressure. Incident pressure was measured at the end of the shock tube using 200 psia Endevco pressure gauges (Model 8530B-200, Meggitt Sensing Systems, Irvine, CA) that were flush with the internal wall of the tube body. Two additional Endevco pressure gauges were rigidly fixed behind the center of the steel plate, with 10 cm between the back of the plate and the center of the gauge faces. Both gauges were oriented to measure incident pressure. ||||| Around 6:30 p.m. on February 17, 1864, eight men crammed into the Confederate submarine H. L. Hunley, a self-propelled metal tube attached to a bomb, and slipped quietly into the freezing black water off the coast of Charleston, South Carolina. The crew hand-cranked the sub more than six kilometers toward its target\u2014the Union blockader USS Housatonic\u2014and surfaced like a leviathan for the charge. By 9:00 p.m., it was over: The Hunley had thrust its spar-mounted torpedo into the Housatonic\u2019s hull and within seconds, 60 kilograms of black powder had caved in the ship. \n \n Just after the brief moment of glory, the Hunley, which had just become the world\u2019s first successful combat submarine, mysteriously sank. \n \n Its demise has baffled scores of researchers and Civil War buffs for more than a century. Now, one maverick scientist is making the bold claim that she has cracked the case. After three years of sleuthing, Rachel Lance, a U.S. Navy biomedical engineer who holds a PhD from Duke University\u2019s Pratt School of Engineering in North Carolina, concludes that the blast from the sub\u2019s own torpedo sent blast waves through its iron hull and caused instant death for the eight men inside. \n \n If she\u2019s right, the mystery of the Hunley may finally be put to rest. But how she made the discovery is almost as surprising as the discovery itself: She did it without access to the physical sub, which was excavated in 2000; without prior experience in archaeology or forensics; and without help from the Hunley Project, a team of researchers and scientists at Clemson University in South Carolina that has been on the case full time for the past 17 years. \n \n Without collaboration or key pieces of data, could Lance\u2019s account of the final moments of the Hunley and its crew be right? \n \n ********** \n \n On a warm September Saturday, I\u2019m standing outside the student center at Duke, a low-rise contemporary building accented with the university\u2019s signature neo-Gothic stone, when Lance swings around the bend in a blue Pontiac Grand Prix straight out of Motor City where she grew up. As I open the passenger door to introduce myself, I\u2019m hit by a wall of thumping workout music. Lance just came from the gym, and her brown, shoulder-length hair is thrown up in an elastic. A blue, stonewashed T-shirt that reads Detroit rides up her pale, lanky arms. \n \n As we make our way off campus, the music keeps pumping. \n \n \u201cWhere are we headed?\u201d I yell. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m taking you to the campus pond to see where we ran some of our experiments,\u201d she thunders back. \u201cIt\u2019s quiet there so we can talk.\u201d \n \n Lance was modeling an underwater explosion at a computer in Duke\u2019s Injury Biomechanics Lab, where she studied blast injuries, when her adviser had the epiphany that set her Hunley obsession in motion. What if, biomechanical engineer Dale Bass suggested, the modeling software could virtually reconstruct the attack on the Housatonic and reveal insights into the fate of the Hunley? Lance, a history buff, was hooked: a historical mystery with a tantalizing lead to follow. Eventually she\u2019d abandon the software for a more hands-on experimental approach, but Bass\u2019s idea was the catalyst she needed. \n \n She began reading theories about why the Hunley went down. One prevailing idea was that the crew ran out of oxygen and suffocated. It was exactly the type of theory she was poised to tackle: she\u2019s been a civil service engineer with the U.S. Navy since 2009 and has expertise in breathing system dynamics and, more specifically, rebreathers\u2014the closed-circuit breathing systems divers use to recycle breathing gas underwater. \n \n As her investigation got underway, Lance noticed there was very little, if any, published research on the crew\u2019s oxygen consumption during the mission. With the navy, she had researched the phenomenon of how much oxygen people used while operating hand-pedal ergometers requiring the same type of motion as the Hunley\u2019s hand-cranked propulsion system. So, she dug up the data and used it to calculate how much oxygen the crew would have used while cranking their way toward the Housatonic. \n \n It wasn\u2019t clear how much oxygen there was to begin with, though. After hauling up the sub, the Hunley Project conservators calculated how much air was likely available. Their data suggests the crew had enough air for little more than two hours. Lance, however, didn\u2019t have access to the actual data. She had met with project members to discuss collaboration, but they wouldn\u2019t share their calculations with her (and, later on, would ask Lance to sign a non-disclosure agreement, which she\u2019d decline). She\u2019d have to go her own way. \n \n ********** \n \n She mulled over the problem for days. Then, she remembered thumbing through a newsletter published by Friends of the Hunley, a nonprofit in Charleston that handles outreach, fundraising, and development for the Hunley Project and runs tours at Clemson\u2019s Warren Lasch Conservation Center where the Hunley is being restored. It was filled with interior and exterior photos of the sub, most of which had measurement notations below them. That gave her an idea. \n \n For the next month, Lance sat hunched over her desk printing out photos of the sub, measuring each demarcated point with a ruler. After weeks of painstaking work, she finally had all the measurements necessary to calculate oxygen consumption versus supply. The results leapt off the page. Suffocation was not a plausible explanation for why the Hunley sank. \n \n \u201cEven with conservative calculations, the crew would have been experiencing noticeable hyperventilation, gasping for breath, choking, symptoms of panic, and likely physical pain from high levels of CO2 in the blood,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we also know from records that they were seated peacefully at their stations without any signs of struggle. So, from my perspective, this tossed the suffocation theory out the window.\u201d The findings were published in the March 2016 issue of the journal Forensic Science International. \n \n Richard Moon, the medical director of the Duke Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Environmental Physiology, agrees. He helped Lance run the calculations and says, \u201cYou have a bunch of submariners who were working moderately hard in an enclosed space. There\u2019s no way they would be working away at the crank in a 10 percent oxygen environment with high levels of CO2 and say, \u2018Oh well, things are fine; we\u2019ll just keep on going.\u2019\u201d \n \n The folks at Clemson weren\u2019t convinced. Kellen Correia, president and executive director of the Friends of the Hunley, stated in an email that, \u201cIt\u2019s premature to draw any final conclusions about the causes of the loss of the submarine or death of the crew, especially when looking at only one aspect of the situation.\u201d She didn\u2019t, however, reference any specific issues with Lance\u2019s findings. \n \n ********** \n \n Debunking the suffocation theory offered Lance some short-term satisfaction, but by this point, she was in deep. She began thinking about the Hunley around the clock, obsessing over it to the point where she\u2019d zone out and stare into her plate of food during dinner with her fianc\u00e9. \u201cThere was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\u201d she says. \n \n In the meantime, Hunley Project conservators at the Warren Lasch Conservation Center were chiseling\u2014and continue to chisel\u2014their way through the stubborn, concrete-like layer of sand and silt that formed around the Hunley as it sat on the seafloor for more than 100 years. \n \n \u201cThe de-concretion has the opportunity to give us more information,\u201d says Clemson archeologist Michael Scafuri, \u201cbut we haven\u2019t uncovered any definitive evidence to completely explain the loss of the Hunley. Nothing in and of itself explains what happened.\u201d \n \n There hasn\u2019t been any case-cracking evidence on the human remains side, either. Linda Abrams, a forensic genealogist who has been working on and off with the Hunley Project since 2006, says all of the crew member skeletons were in good shape when they were excavated from the Hunley\u2019s interior. The sub was completely filled with sediment when it was salvaged, so layer upon layer of muck had to be carefully removed before the bones were exposed. \u201cThere were no bullet wounds in any of these guys,\u201d she says. And no signs of desperation. \n \n While the scientists haven\u2019t come up with a smoking gun, there is a small area of damage to the sub\u2019s exterior that has stumped them. The forward conning tower has a softball-sized chunk of iron missing where a viewport had been. \n \n Through her research, Lance learned of the damage to the conning tower and the so-called lucky shot theory: a stray bullet fired by Housatonic sailors during the attack punctured the tower, causing the sub to fill with water and sink. \n \n From Scafuri\u2019s perspective, it is a possibility. \u201cThe gunfire from the Housatonic may have played a role in this,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we cannot confirm that at this point.\u201d \n \n Lance tested the theory by shooting Civil War-era firearms at cast iron samples\u2014the damage to the sub was inconsistent with damage from her rifle fire. Plus, she says, a bullet hole would have allowed water to rush into the sub quickly and caused it to sink much closer to the attack site than where it was found. \n \n Based on her results, Lance crossed the lucky shot theory off her list and documented the findings in a second paper in Forensic Science International. \n \n The Friends of the Hunley declined to comment on the specific findings, but Correia wrote, \u201cAgain, Ms. Lance doesn\u2019t have any primary knowledge or data of the Hunley Project.\u201d \n \n Lance pressed on. If the crew hadn\u2019t suffocated, and a bullet hole didn\u2019t sink the sub, what did happen? \n \n ********** \n \n When the Hunley took down the towering Housatonic, it was less than five meters away from the blast. And, it was still attached to the torpedo; inspired by Confederate steam-powered torpedo boats known as Davids during the Civil War, the Hunley\u2019s crew had bolted the sub\u2019s torpedo onto the end of its spar. This meant the same explosion that rocked the Housatonic could just as well have meant lights out for the Hunley crew. \n \n Lance had spent the better part of two years investigating the suffocation and lucky shot theories, published twice, and still hadn\u2019t solved the mystery. For her, this explosion theory was the next obvious avenue to explore, and one that meshed well with her injury biomechanics focus at Duke. If a blast wave from the explosion propagated into the interior of the sub, she reasoned, it could have immediately killed the crew or at least injured them sufficiently that they would have been unable to pilot the boat to safety. \u201cWhen blast waves hit an air space, they slow down like a car hitting a wall,\u201d she explains. \u201cExcept in this case, the wall is the surface of the lungs.\u201d The sailors\u2019 lungs could have ruptured and filled with blood. \n \n To test the theory, Lance needed a physical model of the sub. Enter the CSS Tiny, a scale model a sixth the size of the tour bus-length Hunley. Made out of sheet metal, it was a Hunley mini-me right down to ballast tanks filled with water and a steel spar mounted to the bow. \n \n Engineering a miniature submarine wasn\u2019t a stretch for Lance, who grew up working on old cars with her father, a now-retired GM autoworker. As a kid, she was small enough to slide under their 1966 Mustang to change the oil without jacking up the car. \u201cGrowing up around car culture makes it easy to fall in love with machinery and engineering,\u201d she says. \n \n A few minutes after peeling away from campus in Lance\u2019s Pontiac, we pull into a dusty lot at the Duke University reclamation pond. The thumping bass line cuts out abruptly and the soundtrack is replaced with the ratchet-like chorus of crickets. At the pond\u2019s edge, she gestures to the water, thick with algae: this is where the Tiny took a test run. Lance and a few members from her lab used blast simulation devices known as shock tubes to test the Tiny\u2019s pressure gauges and other equipment in advance of the live explosives phase of the experiment. As she stood in the water, raising and lowering the shock tubes, fish chomped at her legs. It was as if she was being repeatedly stabbed with tiny knives\u2014but by the end of it, Lance and the Tiny were ready for the big event. \n \n ********** \n \n The campus pond was off limits to real explosives, so, two weeks later, Lance and her research team trekked out to a three-hectare pond on a rural North Carolina farm for the live ammo tests. They parked the Tiny in the middle of the pond, and with an explosives agent standing guard, the stage was set. Lance began the countdown: \u201cFive! Four! Three! \u2026\u201d The culmination of months of hard work all came down to the next few seconds, and her nerves were frayed as she frantically clicked between sensor readout screens on her laptop. \n \n From a safe distance, farmer Bert Pitt and his grandchildren were ready for the show. Lance had sweet-talked him into volunteering his pond for the project. \u201cWhen Rachel came out to the farm,\u201d says Pitt in a thick southern drawl, \u201cshe tried to butter me up with red velvet cake and explained that it would only be a one-sixth-scale explosion.\u201d \n \n \u201cTwo! One!\u201d Pfffsssssttt! The black powder charge exploded on the Tiny\u2019s spar, and a small geyser of pond water erupted. Pressure gauges hung inside and outside the vessel to measure the underwater blast waves. Below the surface, the explosion jetted a blast wave into the Tiny\u2019s hull with so much force that it caused the metal to flex. That motion, in turn, generated a second blast wave that transmitted straight through the hull into the cabin. \n \n \u201cThe secondary blast wave from this would have easily caused pulmonary blast trauma that killed the whole crew instantly,\u201d Lance says. \u201cThis is what sank the Hunley.\u201d \n \n Moon supports the conclusion. He says most people would assume that the cabin walls would have protected the crew from the blast waves\u2014but few people know much about underwater explosions. \u201cSpeculation up to this point has been fine,\u201d he says, \u201cbut when you hold it up to hard science, I think the blast wave theory is the most plausible explanation.\u201d \n \n While Lance believes the mystery of the Hunley can finally be put to rest, the Hunley Project scientists aren\u2019t ready to jump to conclusions. They\u2019ve acknowledged the explosion theory as a possibility in the past, but began to doubt it prior to Lance\u2019s experiment based on results from a computer modeling study conducted by the US Navy in 2013. The study suggests the blast wave would not have harmed the crew, yet further studies continue to second-guess any previous study conclusions. \n \n \u201cThe problem is, it\u2019s a complicated scenario,\u201d says Scafuri. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of like trying to reconstruct the causes of a car accident with limited information. Would you be able to find evidence of an accident that happened because a bee flew in through the window and distracted the driver, who happened to be texting, on a stretch of road that was slick?\u201d \n \n ********** \n \n \u201cOh, I have something for you,\u201d says Lance at Duke\u2019s reclamation pond. She reaches into her backpack and hands me a cigar-sized, 3D-printed replica of the Hunley\u2014a souvenir of sorts. It offers a micro, yet detailed, view of the sub\u2019s interior that makes me realize how confining the crew compartment\u2014which at full-scale was only one meter wide and 1.2 meters high\u2014must have been for eight grown men. It was a death trap. The fact they crammed themselves into the tube anyway was a sacrifice Lance seems to have unwavering respect for. It\u2019s part of what drove her to press on to the finish line, despite the odds being stacked against her. \n \n ********** \n \n But how could it be that Lance was able to unravel a century-old mystery in such a relatively short period of time, particularly given the Hunley Project\u2019s 14-year head start? Was it beginner\u2019s luck, or her ability to approach the problem from a different scientific vantage? Maybe it simply came down to old-fashioned determination. \u201cYou have to deal with a lot when doing this kind of research, especially when you\u2019re doing things on your own, which can be difficult and lonely,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need to have a lot of perseverance, because that\u2019s where the good stuff is\u2014past that limit where nobody\u2019s been able to push through the problem before.\u201d \n \n In the end, maybe it had more to do with the fact that the Hunley Project is intent on both carrying out the painstakingly slow process of conserving the sub and explaining its disappearance. Although, from a revenue perspective, the mystery in and of itself may be a real positive for the Hunley Project and Friends of the Hunley, considering the sales of T-shirts, shot glasses, and lab tours it helps generate. \n \n Regardless, when Lance\u2019s findings from her blast wave experiment are published (a research paper will be released imminently), the Hunley Project team will be watching. \n \n This time, it will be their theory to disprove. \n \n Related Stories from Hakai Magazine:",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 For more than 150 years, researchers have scratched their heads over a Civil War mystery\u2014and now a Navy engineer says she's solved it. Rachel Lance has been diving deep into the 1864 sinking of the Confederate submarine HL Hunley, which mysteriously went down shortly after sinking the Union's USS Housatonic sloop with a torpedo, reports a Hakai Magazine article posted at Smithsonian.com. Over three years, Lance\u2014a Duke grad student with no experience in forensics, no help from experts who'd long been on the case, and no access to the excavated sub itself\u2014carried out what Gizmodo calls an \"exhaustive \u2026 analysis\" and finally arrived at a conclusion published in PLOS ONE: that the torpedo created blast waves that pierced the Hunley's hull and instantly killed the eight crew, whose skeletons were found intact during the sub's excavation near Charleston, SC, in 2000. Lance looked at other theories swirling around the Hunley's fate, including low oxygen or a bullet fired by the Housatonic that punctured the sub. She became obsessed, to the point she'd zone out during meals. \"There was something viscerally terrifying about the fact that eight people died that night, and we had no idea how or why,\" she tells Hakai. Her injury biomechanics background finally led her to her shock wave theory. \"When blast waves hit an air space, they slow down like a car hitting a wall,\" she says. \"Except in this case, the wall is the surface of the lungs.\" A mini replica of the Hunley she dubbed the CSS Tiny and a series of test explosions in a rural pond helped her prove her theory, per CNN. Other researchers remain unconvinced, but Hakai says now Lance's theory is \"their theory to disprove.\" More on her project here. (The Hunley looks a lot better these days.)",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 When the HL Hunley was raised from the ocean off Charleston, SC, in 2000, its dead crew members hadn't moved from their stations for nearly 150 years. They had no obvious physical injuries, and their deaths appeared to occur so suddenly that they never made a run for the escape hatch, CNN reports. Now, in the journal Plos One, scientists say they've finally cracked the case of what killed the crew so swiftly: a 135-pound torpedo filled with black powder and attached to a pole 16 feet from the ship's hull. The sub was the first to sink an enemy ship in battle, the USS Housatonic, in 1864, but sometime after that, it went down, too. Researchers had unsealed the crew compartment of the Hunley, but they had yet to find conclusive evidence of how the eight men aboard died. The 40-foot-long submarine had no major damage to the hull that could be definitively traced back to the day it sank. The researchers say the torpedo is the key\u2014but many have wondered how an explosion could've killed the entire crew without leaving a trace. Each seaman was subjected to about 60 milliseconds of shockwave trauma, as compared to about 10 milliseconds had the men been exposed above water. They exhibited no broken bones, the drain pumps were closed, as were the air hatches. By the time this shockwave hit the sub and penetrated the crewmen's skin, it slowed down to 30 m/s, which was still enough to cause catastrophic physical damage.\"",

    "document": "p PDF: A front page in Trump\u2019s America \n \n Donald J. Trump\u2019s vision for the future of our nation is as deeply disturbing as it is profoundly un-American. \n \n It is easy to find historical antecedents. The rise of demagogic strongmen is an all too common phenomenon on our small planet. And what marks each of those dark episodes is a failure to fathom where a leader\u2019s vision leads, to carry rhetoric to its logical conclusion. The satirical front page of this section attempts to do just that, to envision what America looks like with Trump in the White House. \n \n It is an exercise in taking a man at his word. And his vision of America promises to be as appalling in real life as it is in black and white on the page. It is a vision that demands an active and engaged opposition. It requires an opposition as focused on denying Trump the White House as the candidate is flippant and reckless about securing it. \n \n Advertisement \n \n After Wisconsin, the odds have shrunk that Trump will arrive in Cleveland with the requisite 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination outright. Yet if he\u2019s denied that nomination for falling short of the required delegates, Trump has warned, \u201cYou\u2019d have riots. I think you\u2019d have riots.\u201d Indeed, who knows what Trump\u2019s fervent backers are capable of if emboldened by the defeat of their strongman at the hands of the hated party elite. \n \n But the rules are the rules \u2014 and if no candidate reaches that magic number, the job of choosing a nominee falls to those on the convention floor. \n \n That\u2019s not a pretty picture. But then nothing about the billionaire real estate developer\u2019s quest for the nation\u2019s highest office has been pretty. He winks and nods at political violence at his rallies. He says he wants to \u201copen up\u201d libel laws to punish critics in the news media and calls them \u201cscum.\u201d He promised to shut out an entire class of immigrants and visitors to the United States on the sole basis of their religion. \n \n The toxic mix of violent intimidation, hostility to criticism, and explicit scapegoating of minorities shows a political movement is taking hold in America. If Trump were a politician running such a campaign in a foreign country right now, the US State Department would probably be condemning him. \n \n Realizing that the party faces a double bind, a few conservatives have been clear-eyed enough to see the need for a plausible, honorable alternative that could emerge from the likely contested convention. Names like Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney have come up. If no candidate gets a majority on the convention\u2019s first ballot, such a nomination might be theoretically possible. \n \n Advertisement \n \n This would have no modern precedent: Ordinarily, parties put aside their differences after primaries and rally to the front-runner because they share basic common goals and values. In any other election cycle, anti-Trump Republicans would just look like sore losers. But Trump lacks those common values \u2014 not just the values of Republicans but, it becomes clearer every day, those of Democrats. \n \n House Speaker Ryan spoke to the possible long-term damage with which the party is flirting. \u201cLeaders with different visions and ideas have come and gone; parties have risen and fallen; majorities and White Houses won and lost,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the way we govern endures: through debate, not disorder.\u201d The problem is that Trump has already crossed lines that a politician with a sincere commitment to democratic norms must never cross. \n \n At some point, after the election, Republicans will also need to ask themselves some tough questions about how their actions and inactions made the party vulnerable to Trump. After all, a candidate spewing anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, authoritarian rhetoric didn\u2019t come out of nowhere; the Tea Party has been strong enough long enough that someone like him shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. Chasing short-term political gains, the GOP missed a lot of chances to fight the hateful currents that now threaten to overwhelm it. \n \n Get Today in Opinion in your inbox: Globe Opinion's must-reads, delivered to you every Sunday-Friday.

Sign up for more newsletters here \n \n For now, Republicans ought to focus on doing the right thing: putting up every legitimate roadblock to Trump that they can. Unexpectedly, a key moment in American democracy has snuck up on the GOP. When he denounced Trump, Romney said he wanted to be able to say he\u2019d fought the good fight against a demagogue. That\u2019s the test other Republicans may want to consider. \n \n Action doesn\u2019t mean political chicanery or subterfuge. It doesn\u2019t mean settling for an equally extreme \u2014 and perhaps more dangerous \u2014 nominee in Ted Cruz. If the party can muster the courage to reject its first-place finisher, rejecting the runner-up should be even easier. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The Republican Party\u2019s standard deserves to be hoisted by an honorable and decent man, like Romney or Ryan, elected on the convention floor. It is better to lose with principle than to accept a dangerous deal from a demagogue. \n \n PDF: A front page in Trump\u2019s America \n \n Discuss: Trump\u2019s vision for America \n \n Letters: Readers respond to the editorial ||||| This image shows a portion of a satirical front page of The Boston Globe published on the newspaper's website on Saturday, April 9, 2016.

Over all, though, he described the flight as mostly normal. He said he could feel the plane slow down and descend after the damage occurred. He arrived in Newark only about an hour and a half behind schedule. \n \n Airplane windows typically have multiple acrylic layers. To deal with the rigors of flight, their curve follows the shape of the fuselage, and their rounded edges make them less susceptible to stress-induced damage. \n \n Southwest said the damage to the window on Wednesday had affected only one layer. \n \n Jim Lee, the founder and chief executive of Lee Aerospace of Wichita, Kan., said plane windows are built to weather that kind of damage. \n \n \u201cOn the 737, there\u2019s two, there\u2019s an outer ply and an inner ply.\u201d said Mr. Lee, whose company makes and repairs airplane windows. Until 1994, he said, Lee Aerospace produced windows on the 737. \u201cEither one of those windows is strong enough to hold the pressure.\u201d \n \n Each pane of an airplane window, he said, is designed to withstand two to four times the amount of pressure it would normally experience while in flight. \n \n \u201cThat outer pane that cracked is generally the one that day in and day out is taking the pressure of the aircraft,\u201d Mr. Lee said. The inner one \u201csits there and just prepares for that outer one to break. And when that outer one breaks, it takes over the pressure. It did a good job.\u201d \n \n He said it was understandable that passengers would worry when a window was damaged, but the window was made with such problems in mind. \u201cWhen that outer pane fails, although it\u2019s going to startle somebody,\u201d it is not dangerous, he said. \n \n Mr. Lee said he expected investigators to be able to determine what had happened fairly easily. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019ll be able to take that window and analyze it under a microscope and understand if it was fatigued over time or what the failure may have been,\u201d he said.",

WSJ's Charles Forelle reports. \n \n Devlin Barrett reports on how federal investigators are working to make the case against accused shooter Jared Loughner in this weekend's massacre in Tucson. Plus, former House Majority Leader Tom Delay is sentenced to three years in prison. \n \n Randy and Amy Loughner disappeared from view shortly after the shootings, and a statement would be the family's first public comments since the attack. \n \n Even in normal times, many on his block describe the elder Mr. Loughner as a reclusive man who had little time for neighborhood niceties. \n \n Few people besides law-enforcement officers have been spotted entering the family home. Neighbor Wayne Smith did so on Monday evening, after he said Mr. Loughner asked him to bring in the mail. \n \n Mr. Smith emerged to tell a small group of reporters that Randy Loughner had written a statement but isn't sure when to release it. Mr. Loughner is reluctant to greet the public and will try to coordinate the release through the local sheriff's office, Mr. Smith said. \n \n \"They're hurting real bad,\" Mr. Smith said, outside the house, in a neighborhood north of Tucson amid a flat carpet of strip malls and low subdivisions. \"They are devastated.\" \n \n Officials say Mr. Loughner had psychological problems and plotted his attack, which killed six people, gravely wounded congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and injured 13 others. \n \n Mr. Loughner's parents have been unreachable since. The parents told investigators they didn't realize the severity of their son's problems, say people familiar with the matter. \n \n The Loughners' single-level ranch house stands out on the quiet and open block: its entire front is shrouded by shrubbery\u2014a billowing mesquite, a cactus with droopy paddles and a stunted palm whose fronds shield a street-facing window. \n \n \"They liked their privacy,\" says George Gayan, a retired mechanic who has lived next door for three decades.

And Mr. Loughner didn't know his, he said. Still, he said he was probably one of Randy Loughner's closest acquaintances in the neighborhood. \n \n He said he believes Randy hasn't worked since Jared was born. Amy had a steady job and Randy raised Jared, he said. \n \n Residents interviewed on the block said they barely knew the Loughners. Stephen Woods, who lives next door, had run-ins with Mr. Loughner over uncollected trash that he said were vituperative and hostile. \n \n Once, Mr. Woods said, Mr. Loughner spotted him from a distance in a Wal-Mart parking lot and repeatedly shouted \"Trash people!\" \n \n It was Mr. Smith who told the Loughners what had happened Saturday. They returned from shopping, grocery bags in their peeling white Chevy truck, to find sheriffs' cars parked in front of the house and deputies stringing up crime-scene tape. \n \n Mr. Smith, who had seen the news on TV, walked up and told them their son was suspected in a mass shooting. \n \n \"She almost passed out right there,\" Mr. Smith said. \"He sat in the road with the tape up and cried.\" \n \n \u2014Evan Perez contributed to this article. \n \n Write to Charles Forelle at charles.forelle@wsj.com",

(Associated Press) \n \n Revellers run with a Puerto de San Lorenzo fighting bull during the third running of the bulls at the San Fermin Festival, in Pamplona, northern Spain, Sunday, July 9, 2017. Revellers from around the world flock to Pamplona every year to take part in the eight days of the running of the bulls. (AP Photo/Alvaro... (Associated Press) \n \n PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 After five gorings on the first two days of this year's San Fermin festival, officials in the northern Spanish city of Pamplona said Sunday's third running of the bulls was quick and resulted in only minor injuries. \n \n The regional government of Navarra said that four men, three Spaniards and one Frenchman, needed to be treated at a nearby hospital for minor injuries caused by knocks and falls. \n \n \"It was a tranquil bull run,\" hospital spokesman Tomas Belzunegui said. \n \n Over the first two days of the festival, four Americans and a Spaniard were gored during the daily bull runs. None were life-threatening injuries. \n \n The bulls from the Puerto de San Lorenzo ranch, which debuted at the festival, completed the 930-yard (850-meter) cobbled-street course in 2 minutes, 22 seconds. That is well under the average of three minutes for the run that weaves through the city center. \n \n A brown bull named \"Huracan,\" or Hurricane, broke away early and sped ahead through the parting crowds of runners, several of whom barely dodged its swinging horns. \n \n Huracan came close to catching a runner when it hooked a horn in the pant leg of a young man entering the bullring, lifting him along the wall before dragging him for a few meters (yards). The man apparently escaped unscathed. \n \n The nine-day San Fermin fiesta attracts tens of thousands of partygoers from Spain and abroad. It was popularized by Nobel Literature laureate Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel \"The Sun Also Rises.\" ||||| A Chicago man who was gored by a bull three years ago while running with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, was gored again on Saturday \u2014 but he still plans to run again on Monday. \n \n Bill Hillmann, an author who has been participating in the annual tradition for 12 years, tells PEOPLE the 1,200-lbs. bull named Sentido jabbed one of its horn into his buttocks and then tossed him up a few feet. However, he says he managed to land on the ground with a relatively soft thud. \n \n \u201cI looked back again, and he was just on me,\u201d Hillmann said in a phone call from Pamplona. \u201cAt the last second, he shot me straight up in the air. The horns just went in in a really weird way, and he gored me.\u201d \n \n Hillmann, 35, explains he immediately went into shock, which blunted the pain. \n \n \u201cI felt the blow send me in the air, but I didn\u2019t feel piercing pain,\u201d he says. \u201cI walked to the medics.\u201d \n \n Stan Olszewski/SOSKIphoto \n \n At first, he says, he didn\u2019t even know he had been gored because his pants were intact after the animal had somehow pulled down his pants and rammed its horn through his yellow underwear into a lower part of his backside. \n \n \u201cThe medics pulled my pants down and there was blood everywhere,\u201d he recalls, adding he avoided serious injury because the horn came near his anus and testicles but missed them. \n \n Hillmann was taken to the hospital where doctors evaluated his wound. \u201cWhen he put his finger in there to check it, it felt like his finger went in two to three inches in my body,\u201d he says. \n \n Stan Olszewski/SOSKIphoto \n \n Hillmann spent 36 hours in the hospital, where doctors stitched up the surface of the deep wound and inserted a small tube which continues to drain the blood. He is able to walk and sit. \n \n The author was released Sunday and is now feeling some pain. However, he said he\u2019ll be back running with the bulls on Monday. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m really in love with the bulls and I\u2019m really in love with the culture, so it\u2019s almost an impossibility I would stop,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019m a daredevil at heart. It\u2019s just who I am.\u201d \n \n Hillmann was more seriously injured during the event in 2014 when a bull gored him twice in the thigh, through one side of his leg and then the other. That time he spent 11 days in the hospital and needed a cane to help him walk for two months, he told The Atlantic. \n \n Stan Olszewski/SOSKIphoto \n \n Hillmann said his initial inspiration to run with the bulls was sparked after he read vivid depictions of bullfighting and bull running in Ernest Hemingway\u2019s 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises. \n \n He said he travels annually to Pamplona for the San Fermin festival, the famed stampede when bulls run through the narrow streets alongside runners in white outfits with red scarves tied around their necks or waists. \n \n This year, Hillmann is being filmed by a crew working on an interactive documentary called \u00a1Fiesta Pamplona! with Hillman as the main character in the \u201cforeign runner\u201d section of the story, producer Jennifer Gonzalez tells PEOPLE from Pamplona. \n \n \u201cHis part of the story is integral in informing viewers the part that foreigners play,\u201d said Gonzalez. \n \n Hillmann says he is happy to be able to live his dream. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m here to run, not sit in a hospital,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to get back out there.

Revellers from around the world flock to Pamplona every year to take part in the eight days of the running of the bulls. (AP... (Associated Press) \n \n BARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 One of the two Americans gored Saturday during this year's second running of the bulls in the Spanish city of Pamplona is swearing that he will run again before the festival is over. \n \n Bill Hillmann, a 35-year-old writer who also was gored three years ago at the San Fermin festival, was in stable condition. The bull that led the pack thrust its horn into Hillmann's buttocks before flipping him onto the street. \n \n \"In a split second he was on me. I tried to jump, but he hit me in the butt,\" the Chicago resident told The Associated Press by telephone from a hospital in Pamplona. \n \n \"I flew up in the air and landed on my back. I didn't know I was gored at first,\" he said. \"Then people started telling me I was gored and pulled me over to the medics. I pulled down my pants and there was blood.\" \n \n Despite his run-in, Hillmann says his love for the chaotic and treacherous spectacle of Pamplona's rampaging bulls hasn't wavered. \n \n \"I am probably going to run tomorrow or the next day, sure at this festival,\" he said. \"I am already walking. The first time, I wasn't walking for a week.\" \n \n Hillmann's wound was less severe than those of a 22-year-old American who also was gored on Saturday.

It made me want to be a writer, to run the bulls, to come to Spain,\" he said. \"When I got here everything in the book was still here, but a thousand times more. And it just keeps getting more interesting. People think this is just crazy people running. There is real art. If you pay attention, you can see it.\" \n \n Hillmann claims to have participated in over 300 bull runs across Spain at traditional summer festivals. He has written a guide on bull running, along with a novel, and was back in Pamplona to make a documentary featuring him as a bull runner. \n \n \"The thing is that when you run, you always have doubts because you are taking a decision that can end your life,\" he said. \"There is a shadow that follows you. Sometimes I don't run because I don't feel right. I usually get premonitions. Not today. I felt good today, but it didn't go my way.\"",

You can\u2019t breathe in there,\u201d said evacuated resident Robynn Stagg, 58, who drove through the thick, orange sulfur dioxide haze earlier this week in a failed attempt to check on her home. \n \n Hawaii\u2019s governor has warned that mass evacuations may be required as more fissures open in the ground and spew lava and gas into semi-rural residential areas on the east flank of Kilauea, one of the world\u2019s most active volcanoes. \n \n During an evening meeting with community members, an official with the United States Geological Survey\u2019s Hawaii Volcano Observatory said that while no new fissures have opened during the last 24 hours, there has been \u201cquite a bit\u201d of ground cracking over the last day and that they were releasing steam. \n \n \u201cBecause the lava intrusion is still active and earthquakes are still occurring, we still think there\u2019s a decent chance of new eruptive activity at the surface,\u201d Steven Brantley said. \n \n Authorities on Thursday completed the removal of highly flammable chemicals from a nearby geothermal power plant that was in the path of creeping lava. \n \n The latest upheaval at Kilauea began last week after the crater floor of a long-active side vent collapsed suddenly in a cloud of ash, triggering a similar plunge in the molten lake inside the larger crater at the volcano\u2019s summit. \n \n What followed was a flurry of earthquakes as huge volumes of magma \u2014 the term for lava beneath the surface \u2014 drained back through deep-underground passages that carried the molten rock far downslope. The lava then forced its way back to the surface through large cracks, or fissures, that opened at ground level in a residential area miles (km) away. \n \n (GRAPHIC: Scorched earth - tmsnrt.rs/2IldVyS) \n \n \u2018BALLISTIC BLOCKS\u2019 \n \n Geologists said Kilauea may be entering a new phase of explosive eruptions not seen in nearly a century that could hurl \u201cballistic blocks\u201d weighing up to 12 tons for half a mile (800 meters), and rain pebble-sized fragments for another mile or two (1.8 to 3.2 km). \n \n Deposits are seen on a road in Puna, Hawaii.

In addition, acid rain damages vegetation and causes tools, barbed-wire fencing and items that can rust to do so a lot faster. \n \n Light winds may allow volcanic haze to become more widespread on the Big Island through Friday night, but weather forecasters said there did not appear to be enough southeast flow to carry the vog to other islands. By late Friday night or Saturday morning, tradewinds should be back, helping to push the vog out to sea. \n \n The primary pollutants in vog, or volcanic smog, are sulfur dioxide gas and fine particulate matter. \n \n The American Lung Association warned the public that sulfur dioxide can have harmful effects on the lungs and cause respiratory problems. Sulfur dioxide irritates the nose, throat and airways to cause coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath or a tight feeling around the chest \u2014 and can trigger asthma attacks. \n \n The effects of sulfur dioxide can be felt very quickly, according to the association, and are especially harmful to children, older adults and people with respiratory conditions. \n \n A two-person team from the Hawaii and Arizona National Guards monitored air quality near fissures in Leilani Estates Wednesday and found no dangerous levels of sulfur dioxide. \n \n Sgt. Milo Kalama of the Hawaii National Guard\u2019s 93rd Weapons of Mass Destruction-Civil Support Team approached a steaming fissure on Leilani Avenue wearing a black, full-face mask. As his air-monitoring equipment buzzed, Kalama removed his mask and declared the air quality normal. \n \n Kau Hospital and Rural Health Clinic reported an uptick in the number of patients with respiratory illness in the emergency room and clinic. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re having difficulty breathing and respiratory issues. It\u2019s starting in Kau,\u201d said hospital spokeswoman Elena Cabatu. \u201cPeople please continue to heed civil defense warnings and read up on the precautions they can take. We\u2019re definitely monitoring our supplies very closely and taking inventory of respiratory therapy supplies. We\u2019re making sure we\u2019re stocked so we\u2019re ready to go.\u201d \n \n Hilo Medical Center, however, has not seen an increase in respiratory patients, she said. \n \n The state Health Department has placed sulfur dioxide and particulate monitoring equipment around the eruption site. Once it is up and running, air quality data from the site will become available online. \n \n Honolulu Star-Advertiser writers Dan Nakaso and Kristen Consillio contributed to this report. ||||| Evacuee Jon Warner, left, walks through rain with son Ethan, right, and daughter Iris after picking up some basic necessities at a makeshift donation center Tuesday, May 8, 2018, in Pahoa, Hawaii. \"We've...

David Ige said Thursday the disaster is so severe that direct federal help is needed. \n \n State officials estimate it will cost more than $2.9 million to protect residents over the next 30 days. The costs will skyrocket if there needs to be large-scale air and sea evacuations. \n \n Two subdivisions were ordered to evacuate last week after lava oozed from cracks in the ground, burning down some two dozen homes. \n \n Ige says there's potential for a larger-scale evacuation as more fissures open.

It is thought to have this effect because it in some way \u2018recreates\u2019 the restricted space of the womb and therefore stops the baby making its startle (Moro) reflex; however, it is not known what the long-term effects of swaddling a baby are. \n \n If the purpose of swaddling your baby is simply to stop them thrashing around, then it may be best to use a muslin (particularly indoors), as it is important that your baby does not overheat. \n \n How to swaddle a baby \n \n Place a large cot blanket on the floor, and lay it in a diamond shape, folding the top point over to create a flat edge for your baby\u2019s shoulders to lie among. Bring one top corner across to tuck under her bottom, and bring the bottom point up to tuck into this wrap. You can wrap the other top corner around her and tuck the corner in to secure in the material at her neck (this section has been copied from \u2018Babycalming\u2019 by Caroline Deacon, by agreement). The baby's legs should be able to move into a \u2018frog position\u2019, rather than being held straight (see Natural Positioning below). \n \n Arguments against swaddling \n \n Recently, some experts have reviewed studies on swaddled infants, and it has been suggested that swaddling could have implications for: \n \n increased risk of cot death, \n \n reduced breastfeeding at birth and/or \n \n increased early weight loss \n \n Additional concerns raised regarding swaddling have included increased incidences of developmental hip dysplasia, acute respiratory infections and overheating; however these may be circumvented by modifying the swaddling style used (see video above) and by avoiding extra bedding. \n \n Natural positioning \n \n Heavily swaddling a baby in order to breastfeed may feel easier, but allowing your baby freedom of movement with their hands leads to a more natural latch - babies naturally explore with their hands when breastfeeding. Your baby may also get very warm while breastfeeding, so it's safer not to have constrictive blankets. \n \n An infant's natural hip position is 'frog' style \u2013 with legs drawn up and thighs roughly at right angles to the body. This helps the ball and socket joint develop properly in the hip. There is some evidence that excessive swaddling with legs 'straight down' prevents this joint developing properly (hip dysplasia or DDH). Babies\u2019 legs need to be able to move in a more natural 'frog' position. \n \n Keeping safe when swaddling \n \n The Lullaby Trust (formerly FSID) makes the following recommendations: \n \n Parents should be aware of the potential risks of swaddling their infant, particularly of the use of heavy materials for swaddling. \n \n Don't cover a baby's head, and only use thin materials for swaddling. \n \n Infants must NEVER be placed on their stomach when swaddled. \n \n Other carers, such as grandparents, should also be made aware of your baby\u2019s usual sleeping environment and practices. \n \n Further information \n \n NCT's helpline offers practical and emotional support in all areas of pregnancy, birth and early parenthood: 0300 330 0700. \n \n You might find attending one of NCT's Early Days groups helpful as they give you the opportunity to explore different approaches to important parenting issues with a qualified group leader and other new parents in your area. \n \n The Lullaby Trust (formerly FSID) has information on swaddling. ||||| Historically infant swaddling was almost a universal practice. It involved binding or bundling babies in blankets with the arms restrained and the lower limbs extended. It remains common in the Middle East1 and in some ethnic groups with or without a board or cradle.2 There has been a recent resurgence of swaddling because of its perceived palliative effect on excessive crying, colic and promoting sleep. Approximately 90% of infants in North America are swaddled in the first few months of life.3 \n \n A recent systemic review4 concluded that in general swaddled infants do arouse less and sleep longer. Preterm infants showed improved neuromuscular development. \n \n In the UK a recent Drug and Theraputics Bulletin review of the management of infant colic5 concluded that the current evidence base does not support the use of swaddling in its management. This review and the systematic review however noted the association of swaddling with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), the latter concluding \u2018attention to this adverse effect is of utmost importance\u2019. DDH is one of \u2026 ||||| Swaddling babies is on the rise: Add it to the long list of mixed messages new parents get about infant care. It helps fussy babies calm down, but given some health concerns, your swaddling technique (and frequency) should be checked out. \n \n One of the first things many new parents learn these days is the craft of swaddling their infant children. I, for one, remember with a feeling almost approaching fondness the moment during parenting class when I had to demonstrate for all assembled how to swaddle a doll in a theoretically sound manner. (I did it, more or less, a rare personal triumph over my own lack of spatial relations skills.) \n \n Swaddling is great. It has a way of transforming a wildly flailing, highly annoyed noise-emitting little vortex of fuss into a sweet, restful, convenient-to-carry bundle of joy \u2013 the kind you'd always anticipated bringing into your lives, and have been somewhat disappointed to see only intermittently among all the diaper changes and random meltdowns. \n \n But \u2013 like basically anything baby related \u2013 the practice has a recently renewed sheen of controversy. Via BBC: \n \n Writing in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, Prof [Nicholas] Clarke [of Southhampton University Hospital] argued: \"There has been a recent resurgence of swaddling because of its perceived palliative effect on excessive crying, colic and promoting sleep. \n \n \"In order to allow for healthy hip development, legs should be able to bend up and out at the hips. This position allows for natural development of the hip joints. \n \n \"The babies' legs should not be tightly wrapped in extension and pressed together.\" \n \n Fear of hip damage runs side-by-side with other concerns about infants overheating (ah, the often grandma-instigated temptation of adding that second ... and third ... and fourth blanket) and a raised risk of crib death. Granted that the concerns largely focus on improperly restrictive swaddling (and/or parents who place swaddled infants to sleep on their faces, who are hopefully a small-to-nonexistent percentage of the population) but it's still scary stuff. \n \n So: fantastic. Swaddling is the best way to help your infant sleep and make your lives as parents feel manageable, and it's also, of course, dangerous. Throw it on the pile of stresses of being a new parent, along with exclusive-to-the-point-of-exhaustion breast-feeding, controversy over co-sleeping, and the ambitious and almost certainly overstated diaper-free fad that seemed to be sweeping one small, extremely well-documented part of Brooklyn earlier this year. \n \n The controversy over the safety of swaddling isn't, of course, new \u2013 the practice has gone into and out of vogue many times over the years. Early this year, Huffington Post noted a back-and-forth over the practice taking place in day cares, where a pitched battle was and still is being fought about the balance between absolute child safety (fears over hip problems or swaddled babies struggling with loose blankets or ending up on their faces) and child happiness (getting adequate sleep). \n \n All that written, there is, thankfully, some agreement on methods of swaddling that avoid some or all of the risk: If you're a parent of an infant well-and-truly freaked out by all the back and forth there is a nicely written resource on the website of Britain's National Childbirth Trust that provides an overview of the practice, the risks, and (most helpfully) how to do it right, including a video called \"How to Hip-Healthy Swaddle your Baby.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Swaddling is by all accounts on the rise among new parents, but a pediatric orthopedic surgeon thinks it's a bad trend, reports the BBC. Wrapping a baby tightly with blankets restricts the infant's hips from moving freely and raises the risk that they won't develop properly, the UK doctor writes in the Archives of Disease in Childhood. \"In order to allow for healthy hip development, legs should be able to bend up and out at the hips.\" In other words, \"the babies' legs should not be tightly wrapped in extension and pressed together.\" Swaddling is thought to work because it mimics the feel of the womb and thus calms the baby. Great, writes James Norton at the Christian Science Monitor, this is yet more conflicting advice for confused parents. Controversy over swaddling isn't new, he adds, and his blog post provides a link to techniques that he says avoid most or all of the risk to infants.",

In a piece titled \"The Art of Swaddling,\" Dr. Nicholas Clarke, an orthopaedic surgeon and co-founder of Southhampton University Hospital, explains that the art of swaddling is back in vogue \"because of its perceived palliative effect on excessive crying, colic, and promoting sleep.\" He goes on to explain that in order to \"allow for healthy hip development, legs should be able to bend up and out at the hips.\" In fact, he says, it's one of the only ways in which one can have a healthy hip without damaging it. So how does he manage it? Well, first of all, he's a doctor, so he knows exactly what he's doing. He's also, as the BBC puts it, \"an expert in the field of obstetrician-gynecology.\" But he's also a co-author of a book on the subject, and he's written a book of his own about the subject as well. He says he was inspired to write the book after reading an article in the journal Archives of Disease in Childhood, which is published by the University of Nottingham. In the book, he describes the phenomenon as a \"recent resurgence\" of \"swaddling\" because of its effect on crying and colic. He also explains why he thinks it's important for parents to learn how to swaddle their children. (Click to read about a study that found one in four babies is suffocated.)",

    "document": "Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords is in critical condition after being shot in the head on Saturday morning. \"I am very optimistic about her recovery,\" said a doctor at the University Medical Center in Tucson, while acknowledging that the bullet went through her brain. In 2007, Michelle Tsai explained how one might survive a gunshot to the head. The article is reprinted below. \n \n A sheriff's deputy in Wisconsin killed his ex-girlfriend and five others at a house party on Sunday, then fled. When he was caught hours later, he used his .40-caliber Glock pistol to commit suicide\u2014shooting himself twice from under the chin, and then once through the right side of his head. How'd he manage to shoot himself in the head three times? \n \n He kept missing the brain. A gunshot to the head isn't always fatal; when the gun is aimed upward from the chin, the recoil can angle the muzzle toward the face. In this case, the bullet travels through the mouth and nose instead of back into the head, where the brain lies. The victim of such a wound would suffer serious injuries to the face; he might also suffocate if the bullet hit part of his nose, or if bits of flesh block the breathing pathway. But the pain isn't necessarily excruciating; survivors say it's like being punched or kicked in the face. A victim might even remain alert enough to use his hands, or, in the case of the sheriff's deputy, to reposition his gun and try again. \n \n The severity of a self-inflicted bullet wound to the head depends on a few factors. The larger the bullet, the more damage, since the projectile destroys any tissue in its path. Hollow-point bullets that shatter are especially dangerous, as the fragments can spread into a larger swath of brain tissue. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n But where the bullet goes is most important: the farther from the center of the brain, the greater the chance of survival. If a bullet grazes the tip of one of the lobes of the brain, the patient will probably live with proper medical treatment. If a bullet enters just one hemisphere, it's still possible to make a reasonable recovery. Someone who took a shot just to the front of the brain might suffer personality changes, like Phineas Gage, the 19th-century railroad worker who became obstinate and profane after an accident. A patient with a wound to the side of the head usually arrives at the hospital unconscious but breathing. \n \n The gravest bullet trajectories cross from one side of the head to the other, striking the center of the brain along the way. Here lie the brain stem, the diencephalon, and other structures that together govern basic life functions such as breathing, the heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature. A bullet through the mouth, Hitler-style, can kill immediately if it strikes the brain stem. \n \n Whatever the angle, gunshot wounds to the head are usually fatal. According to unpublished data from the University of Maryland, of 264 such victims from 2000, all but 29 died on the spot. Of the 27 who were accounted for, only 18 made it into an operating room. Eight survived with significant disabilities; 10 had a good recovery. \n \n Got a question about today's news?

Linda Lopez, confirmed the bullet entered Giffords\u2019 head at her temple and exited through her forehead. Lopez said Giffords was responding to commands before surgery but is not sure what Giffords' long-term prognosis is. \n \n \u201cIf the bullet goes through both hemispheres and leans toward the base of skull, that is where most of the vascular tissues are, and that can be a deadly result,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cIf the bullet goes through both hemispheres, but there is a clean exit wound, the patient can be lucky and there might not be any significant damage. Of course, the best prognosis is when the bullet affects only one hemisphere. Nonetheless, any gunshot wound to the head is going to leave residual side effects.\u201d \n \n Alvarez said the next three to four days is considered the most critical for Giffords, and recovery could take years to achieve. \n \n \u201cDoctors carefully opened the skull and looked for any type of bleeding and then cauterized blood vessels,\u201d Alvarez said. \u201cPatients are kept under anesthesia for three to four days to monitor brain swelling, which is one of the complications of this surgery.\" \n \n Alvarez pointed to the story of a British soldier who survived a gunshot wound to the brain but learned to walk and talk again and in October 2010 was quoted in the The Sun as saying, \u201cThey say I\u2019m a walking miracle.\u201d \n \n The soldier, Liam Brentley, was shot near the ear, and the bullet came out the other side of his head, pinging a wall, according to the U.K. newspaper. \n \n Brentley is deaf in one ear and has some memory loss.",

    "document": "As far as wartime sacrifices go, it\u2019s hard to beat the plight of the wood ants of Templewo, Poland. \n \n There, near the border of Germany, a large colony has established over a Soviet nuclear arms base that was operational from the 1960s until 1992. Except, no one thought to tell the ants that the Cold War is over. And every year hundreds of thousands of ants soldier off and fall down a ventilation pipe into the weapons storage bunker below ground, never to see the light of day again. \n \n In the bunker, the ants find themselves in total darkness, with very little food to eat. Temperatures rarely hit 50 degrees, even in the summer. But do these ants give up in despair? No, they do not. They simply keep working, building, and maintaining their mound. They\u2019ll do it until they die, of starvation or old age, but it won\u2019t matter. A younger generation is on its way, ready to cart off the fallen to a two-million-strong ant cemetery beyond the mound and continue their endless, pointless labor. \n \n Researchers stumbled upon this strange colony in 2013, after crawling into the bunker through \u201csome illegally dug cracks\u201d to count a small population of bats that had made a home inside the nuclear storage facility. The scientists, led by Wojciech Czechowski of the Polish Academy of Sciences, published their descriptions of the ants Monday in the Journal of Hymenoptera Research. \n \n Monitoring since then has found no evidence that the colony is able to produce offspring. In July 2015 the researchers dismantled a section of the 10-inch-high mound looking specifically for larvae, pupae, empty cocoons, and queens, but found none. When they returned in January 2016, the damage had been repaired. The scientists suspect that the cold temperatures and paucity of nutritious food sources make reproduction impossible. \n \n story continues below \n \n Nevertheless, the colony appears to be maintaining its size, and perhaps even growing. The researchers estimate that at least several hundred thousand ants, possibly a million, call the bizarre barren mound home. \n \n In the summer, the ants climb the walls of the bunker, perhaps in an effort to touch the warmer air coming from above. But the researcher saw no ants on the ceiling, and no evidence that any of them had ever returned to the mother colony above. \n \n If the ants closer to the surface had self-awareness of their plight, surely by now they would have developed some complicated mythology about those lost down the pipe, destined to toil away below and never to return. They are the chosen ones, off to serve some higher purpose, they tell one another. Their work must mean something, though they are blinded to it in the darkness. \n \n story continues below \n \n But here we are, like the omniscient narrator of some perfect dystopian fiction, and we know the truth: The war is over, and your cold, sexless mound serves no purpose except to bring some small comfort to the latest batch of arrivals that there is still some work to be done. \n \n Photos via Wojciech Stephan / Journal of Hymenoptera Research ||||| Wojciech Stephan \n \n Wojciech Stephan \n \n Wojciech Stephan \n \n Wojciech Stephan \n \n Wojciech Stephan \n \n Wojciech Stephan \n \n Wojciech Stephan \n \n Wojciech Stephan \n \n For the past several years, a group of researchers has been observing a seemingly impossible wood ant colony living in an abandoned nuclear weapons bunker in Templewo, Poland, near the German border. Completely isolated from the outside world, these members of the species Formica polyctena have created an ant society unlike anything we've seen before. \n \n The Soviets built the bunker during the Cold War to store nuclear weapons, sinking it below ground and planting trees on top as camouflage. Eventually a massive colony of wood ants took up residence in the soil over the bunker. There was just one problem: the ants built their nest directly over a vertical ventilation pipe. When the metal covering on the pipe finally rusted away, it left a dangerous, open hole. Every year when the nest expands, thousands of worker ants fall down the pipe and cannot climb back out. The survivors have nevertheless carried on for years underground, building a nest from soil and maintaining it in typical wood ant fashion. Except, of course, that this situation is far from normal. \n \n Polish Academy of Sciences zoologist Wojciech Czechowski and his colleagues discovered the nest after a group of other zoologists found that bats were living in the bunker. Though it was technically not legal to go inside, the bat researchers figured out a way to squeeze into the small, confined space and observe the animals inside. Czechowski's team followed suit when they heard that the place was swarming with ants. What they found, over two seasons of observation, was a group of almost a million worker ants whose lives are so strange that they hesitate to call them a \"colony\" in the observations they just published in The Journal of Hymenoptera. Because conditions in the bunker are so harsh, constantly cold, and mostly barren, the ants seem to live in a state of near-starvation. They produce no queens, no males, and no offspring. The massive group tending the nest is entirely composed of non-reproductive female workers, supplemented every year by a new rain of unfortunate ants falling down the ventilation shaft. \n \n Like most ant species, wood ants are tidy animals who remove waste from their colony. In the case of the bunker ants, most of this waste is composed of dead bodies. The researchers speculate that mortality in the \"colony\" is likely much higher than under normal circumstances. \"Flat parts of the earthen mound [of the nest] and the floor of the adjacent spaces ... were carpeted with bodies of dead ants,\" write Czechowski and colleagues. This \"ant cemetery\" was a few centimeters thick in places, and \"one cubic decimeter sample contained [roughly] 8,000 corpses,\" which led the researchers to suggest that there were likely 2 million dead ants piled around the nest mound. The sheer numbers of dead bodies suggest that this orphaned wood ant nest has been active for many years. \n \n The ant graveyard is also host to a tiny ecosystem, where mites and a few other invertebrates feed on the bodies of the dead wood ants. The question is, what are the wood ants eating? It's possible they have figured out how to eat the creatures who feast in their cemeteries, essentially making them cannibals at one remove. But Czechowski and his team dismiss this as unlikely. It's also possible that there are nutrients growing in the bat guano from the ants' only living neighbors in the bunker. But in their years of observation, the scientists still haven't figured out for certain what the ants' source of food is. \n \n Wood ants are known for surviving in harsh conditions, and they have been found on remote islands as well as living in small, closed boxes. And it's not impossible that this underworld colony could bloom into something more. In a previous experiment, Czechowski showed that orphaned wood ant colonies will adopt queens from related species. So if a queen ant fell down the pipe, she might join this colony and start reproducing. Unfortunately, however, without a steady food supply the ants probably wouldn't have enough energy to raise a new generation and keep the nest warm for them. So the only way this nest carries on is by waiting for a new rain of ants from the free colony above ground. \n \n The paper's conclusion reads like a dystopian science fiction scene from the 1970s: \n \n The wood-ant \u2018colony\u2019 described here \u2013 although superficially looking like a functioning colony with workers teeming on the surface of the mound \u2013 is rather an example of survival of a large amount of workers trapped within a hostile environment in total darkness, with constantly low temperatures and no ample supply of food. The continued survival of the \u2018colony\u2019 through the years is dependent on new workers falling in through the ventilation pipe. The supplement of workers more than compensates for the mortality rate of workers such that through the years the bunker workforce has grown to the level of big, mature natural colonies. \n \n Life in an abandoned nuclear weapons bunker is nightmarish, even for the humble ant. It appears that the legacy of the Soviet occupation of Poland doesn't just haunt the country's human population. It has affected the social structures of insects too. \n \n Journal of Hymenoptera Research, 2016. DOI: 10.3897/jhr.51.9096 \n \n Listing image by Wojciech Stephan",

Scores of wood ants living near an old nuclear weapons bunker in western Poland plunge seemingly to death each year\u2014and their descendants follow them\u2014in a bizarre ritual that has amazed scientists. The story begins with hard-working ants that built a colony atop a defunct Soviet-era bunker, reports ArsTechnica. When metal covering a ventilation pipe rusted way, the ants began tumbling down. What sounds like a death sentence (they can\u2019t climb out, there is no food, and it is very cold) has turned into a survival story because these worker ants keep doing what they always do: building until they die. And when they do? \"A younger generation is on its way, ready to cart off the fallen to a two-million-strong ant cemetery beyond the mound and continue their endless, pointless labor,\" reports Inverse. Researchers write in the Journal of Hymenoptera that a million or so trapped ants have managed to carry on in a virtual Cold War nightmare, living in a near-starvation state and total darkness. The colony rests atop a thick cemetery of ant ancestors, indicating this has been going on for quite some time. Zoologists who stumbled upon the odd discovery in Templewo while counting bats doubted cannibalism was keeping the insects alive, suggesting bat excrement could be doing the trick. The ants produce no offspring, and so the colony's survival depends on surface ants making the same mistake they did. Wood ants are known to be resilient, though, with one colony surviving on a barren islet for nearly 30 years with only pine trees to munch, the researchers write.

Passengers were allowed to board the flight, Bridges said, and once the flight was filled those on the plane were told that four people needed to give up their seats to stand-by United employees that needed to be in Louisville on Monday for a flight.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 People are outraged after video surfaced Sunday night showing a passenger being forcibly and violently removed from a United Airlines flight that had been overbooked. As the Courier-Journal reports, four seats were needed on the Chicago-to-Louisville flight so that crew members could get to Louisville for a flight assignment Monday morning. Passengers were told that volunteers were needed to give up their seats and that they would receive $400, a hotel stay, and a flight the following day. They were told the flight wouldn't take off until four people had given up their seats, but no one volunteered. The airline then doubled the offer to $800 and still no one volunteered. A manager then came on board and used a computer to randomly select passengers who would need to leave the flight. A couple was selected and left, and then the man in the video was selected. He explained that he's a doctor and had patients he needed to see Monday morning, but was told that security would be called if he didn't exit the flight voluntarily. He said he would be calling his lawyer, and eventually, three security officials came onboard, pulled him from his seat, and dragged him down the aisle and off the plane. Passengers say everyone on the flight was appalled, and children onboard were scared. The man got back on the plane, reportedly \"disoriented\" and with his face bloodied, and ran to the back of the plane. A medical crew came aboard and passengers were asked to return to the gate while the plane was \"tidied up.\" Eventually the plane departed two hours late. United has since apologized for overbooking, the Week reports, but no update has been given on the passenger who was removed. Video of the incident from two different angles is here and here.",

    "document": "Abstract \n \n We tested several hypotheses regarding the relationship between marital characteristics and sexual outcomes among 1,656 married adults ages 57\u201385 years from the 2005\u20132006 National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project. Results showed that individuals in their first marriage had more frequent sex than remarried individuals; marital duration had a curvilinear (U-shaped) relationship with frequency of sex; and a linear relationship between marital duration and frequency of sex varied by gender such that men had more frequent sex than women in younger marriages. We speculate that relationship permanency may drive the greater sexual activity in first marriages and sicker men in younger marriages may drive frequency of sex for women in younger marriages. ||||| The study also found that older people still in first marriages have sex more often than those who have remarried \n \n While people in the early years of marriage have sex more frequently, and their sexual activity tapers off over time, a slight rebound occurs for those whose marriages endure longer than half a century, according to new research. \n \n The study also found that people who remain in their first marriages have sex more frequently than those who remarry. But frequency aside, marriage order made no difference when it came to actual physical pleasure and emotional satisfaction, said researchers from Louisiana State University, Florida State University and Baylor University. \n \n Their study -- \"Marital Characteristics and the Sexual Relationships of U.S. Older Adults: An Analysis of National Social Life, Health and Aging Project Data\" -- is published in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior, the official publication of the International Academy of Sex Research. \n \n Researchers analyzed the relationship between marital characteristics and sexual outcomes among 1,656 married adults ages 57-85, using data from the first wave of the National Social Life, Health and Aging Project. They noted that people who survive until their 50th year of marriage -- among whom the slight rebound occurred -- are relatively few in number. \n \n \"Additionally, the study used a snapshot in time -- and therefore cannot prove that length and order of marriage caused sexual frequency,\" said former Baylor researcher Samuel Stroope, Ph.D., now an assistant professor of sociology at Louisiana State University. \n \n Nevertheless, the study provided \"intriguing results\" for one of the fastest growing age groups in the United States -- and one whose sexual behavior rarely has been studied, he said. \n \n One uncertainty that could be the subject of future research is the \"why\" of the findings. While sex becomes less of a novelty over time and frequency tends to diminish, \"it may be that the permanency of the relationship contributes to sexual relations picking up a bit at the end,\" Stroope said. \n \n \"Growing old as a couple, with the experience and knowledge that come with that, may play a part,\" he said. \"You are able to learn about your partner and build on that over time. You may have a higher level of trust when you feel that your spouse isn't going to go anywhere. The expectation that the relationship will continue may give you more reason to invest in the relationship -- including in sexual aspects of the relationship.\" \n \n As to why \"remarrieds\" have less frequent sex than those in first marriages, \"it may be that those who have been married in the past may not have as strong of a sense of permanence or lasting investment,\" Stroope said. \n \n Michael McFarland, Ph.D., assistant professor of sociology and public health at Florida State University, was a study co-author. Researcher Jeremy Uecker, Ph.D., an assistant professor of sociology at Baylor and also a co-author, noted that \"we know a great deal about sexual behavior at younger stages of the life course. This study adds to a small but growing body of research on the sexual behavior of older adults.\" \n \n Added Stroope: \"As people age, they tend to be more even-keeled, which may help cut down on marital conflict and facilitate regular sexual activity into advanced age.\" \n \n The findings may surprise some in a society in which youth is the ideal and older adults are often subjected to ageism, researchers say. Despite stereotypes, the study joins other research in revealing that regular sexual activity remains a part of many older adults' lives -- even with declining health and the death of a spouse on the horizon. \n \n ###",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's no secret that most married couples have less sex as the years go by, but those who stick it out tend to see something of a romantic renaissance\u2014it just takes five decades to get there. Researchers looking at 1,656 married adults ranging in age from 57 to 85 have found there is eventually an uptick in the frequency with which couples have sex. What's more, those in first marriages are having more sex than those who have remarried, report researchers from Louisiana State University, Florida State University, and Baylor University in the journal Archives of Sexual Behavior. However frequently or infrequently couples were engaging in sex, marriage order didn't appear to influence emotional satisfaction or physical pleasure. \"Growing old as a couple, with the experience and knowledge that come with that, may play a part,\" one researcher said in a Baylor University news release. \"The expectation that the relationship will continue may give you more reason to invest in the relationship\u2014including in sexual aspects of [it].\" While the results about the sex lives of one of the fastest growing groups in the US proved \"intriguing,\" particularly because it's a topic that has yet to be studied extensively, the researchers did point out that the 50-year second wind was a slight one, and that relatively few couples make it to 50 years to begin with, thus the sample size was small. (Some research has found that couples who are more equal tend to be happy but have less sex.)",
