    "document": "The House That Spite Builds On Malicious Erection, Everlasting Fights, and Fire's Power \n \n Aaron Young\u2019s \u2018Tumbleweed,\u2019 2009. Courtesy the artists and Lawrimore Project \n \n Spite is a step beyond anger. It happens when anger has hardened, you've polished it shiny, and you've fallen in love with it. Now in dangerous territory, you nevertheless can't stop, and you decide it needs a monument. What you do next is inescapably, pigheadedly wrong\u2014and also epically right. You build a spite house. \n \n There is a spite house at 2022 24th Avenue East in Montlake. It is pink stucco on the outside and only four-and-a-half feet wide at one end. Legend has it that a wife put it up after a judge awarded her husband their house and her just the front yard in the divorce. But that's not true. It went up in 1925; the next-door neighbor who wanted the sliver of land it sits on made the landowner such a low offer that he responded by building the little house right up in the neighbor's face. The spiter won: The neighbor moved. \n \n The neighbor should have fought harder, because the law, dreadful downer that it is, was on his side. \"Malicious erection\" (I know) statutes in many states, including Washington, specifically prohibit spite houses, giving neighbors the right to an injunction or a teardown if the foundation is, say, poured in the dead of night (it has happened). The existence of such laws is a testament to the unstoppable drive to build spite houses, and most of the laws were implemented late in the 19th century, including Washington's. Older East Coast states had more time to litter the land with their spite. Skinny, weirdly shaped, charming, divided-in-half houses for spurned wives, rivalrous brothers, and affronted landowners \"uncover our creepy and creeping psychologies of ownership,\" Will Owen writes in a new limited-edition chapbook called Spite House. They set out in the open the foul \"swell of psychic things that exist despite never being meant to be placed alongside each other.\" They are fights that last forever. \n \n Given the depthless cheer and facade of rationality that pervades American public life, there is something deeply calming about spite houses. They are homicidally sincere, wanton, and unwise. As in the case of Edith Macefield's Ballard house\u2014which in 2007 she refused to sell for a cool million to developers, who had to build around her until she died, inspiring a rash of tattoos depicting her house with the word \"STEADFAST\" (after her death it was sold, but not to the original developers)\u2014these houses are volcanoes of meaning, like heroes or great works of art. They're a terrific\u2014maybe a little too terrific\u2014premise for an art show. The show is spending this month at Lawrimore Project, curated by Yoko Ott and Jessica Powers. (The Spite House chapbook is part of Spite House the show.) It is both a fascination and a disappointment, maybe inevitably. Little of the art on display has the bilious, committed power of an actual spite house (and much of it seems peculiarly impersonally motivated) or the ability to compete with an odd and unexpected intervention: nature's own fury. \n \n What happened is that precisely on the eve of the show's opening, a house caught on fire in the side courtyard of the gallery. The house was a work of art called There Goes the Neighborhood by the performance trio SuttonBeresCuller, and the only thing convincing about their claim that this wasn't a performance was the fact that they seemed genuinely glum\u2014and that the facade of the gallery itself was broadly singed, its windows blasted out, its insulation melted into a crawling still-life. Boxes full of an entire earlier exhibition, held inches away in storage inside, were nearly decimated. \"At first we thought, maybe? Maybe an artist broke in and did this? But arson is not painting a corner black or something. Arson is going too far,\" curator Powers said later. (The police suspect somebody homeless stole into the open house\u2014maybe not for the first time? It has sat there for months\u2014and accidentally set it on fire.) The remaining visual spectacle is incredibly beautiful (meant both ways, as in very beautiful and beautiful in particular because it is not quite believable). \n \n Now, an act of god and poverty does not provide grounds for fair criticism, but in this case it embodies a level of intensity that is as difficult to achieve in art as it is in life. Spite House is a smart show that succeeds best when it displays less good judgment. As much as I dislike New York artist Aaron Young's cocky, Viacom-scaled, I-make-paintings-with-motorcycles-in-an-arena bullshit, his tumble\u00adweed made of a crumpled-up chain-link fence plated in 24-karat gold\u2014and his intact 24-karat fence obscuring a video by Vancouver's Andrew Dadson\u2014hit exactly the right snarling but formalized tone. Spite houses, after all, are not instantaneous ejaculations: They take formal planning. \n \n When Dadson goes creeping across the roofs of his neighbors' houses in his slightly slowed-down 2005 video, it's a perfect encapsulation of what seethes and seeps through every neighborhood, so invisible and yet so visible. From inside these houses, you might hear his faint steps or you might not\u2014but outside, Dadson is plain as day. The photographs of sections of his neighbors' lawns that he's guerrilla-spray-painted black feel easier, less unlikely, less haunting (though the image of a white picket fence in blackface is a satisfying symbol). I love his white roses set in a vase of black ink: They absorb the ink like a disease, the petals taking on black spots, then the dots join, and eventually the rot becomes mournfully complete. It's not spiteful; it's gothic and melancholy. \n \n Not all the spite is as literal or as contained as Dadson's boundary-stompings. The artworks in the show (as in any group show) spite each other, as with Young's partial blockage of the view of Dadson's video; or they spite you, the viewer. Miami artist Bert Rodriguez's thick white wall\u2014an ongoing and rather heartwarming project wherein he builds white walls with his father, who cannot understand why his son must be an artist, in various locations\u2014is here turned mean. It is the precise width of the gallery's extrawide double door, so the show rebuffs you with a big white nothing. Sutton\u00adBeresCuller spited the viewer by blocking the entrance to the white-cube gallery, which people seem to miss entirely, rendering the spite rather ineffectual. \n \n On your way up to the door, you probably missed Matt Browning's contribution: the Seattle artist painted black the pink sections of the gallery's exterior, spiting the architects, two other Seattle artists: Lead Pencil Studio. Christian Kliegel spited them, too, and the gallery's owner, Scott Lawrimore. Kliegel, of Vancouver, broke into the gallery one night before the show was up. He took a look around and made drawings that were then added as tape marks on the floor for his suggested redesign of their space. \n \n Eli Hansen and Herman Beans are spiting the human attempt to spite death with neatness (I think). They made a messy, dirty coffin-house with windows and a bookshelf (the inverse of SuttonBeresCuller's paranoically sterile Homesick, not in this show). They thought people would rummage through the blankets (which I recommend), but people haven't. \n \n What we have here are good artworks not equally served or activated by the theme. They're sort of... spited. In the eternal property war between curators and artists, curators can count this spite house as their own. Which, in a weird way, works. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

And, depending on the story you believe, there's a home in Montlake -- a small one at that -- that was likely built with the capital 'S' in mind. \n \n \n \n To neighbors the 830-square-foot house on the corner of 24th Avenue East and East Boston in Montlake is an icon; but what the home, known as the Montlake Spite House, lacks in size it more than makes up for in story, myth and legend. \n \n \n \n The house, which is currently up for sale, was originally built in 1925. The listing agent describes it best when she says the original owner took full advantage of the pie-shaped property by creating a pie-shaped home; the back of the home is just 4.5 feet wide and the front is only 15 feet. But aside from its unique shape and size, what sets this home apart from its neighbors is how it allegedly came to be. \n \n \n \n \"I can't imagine why else someone would build a house like that if it wasn't out of spite,\" says Lisa Horton, the owner of the home. \n \n \n \n Some neighbors tell the tale of a husband, a wife and a divorce settlement. Allegedly a judge awarded the husband the house and the wife the front yard; so out of spite up went the tiny home, by the wife, on top of her front yard. But that's not true, according to The Stranger. A story published several years ago by the newspaper supports a different tale, one which is very familiar to Horton. \n \n \n \n \"I always heard it was a land dispute,\" Horton says. \n \n \n \n The story alleges the home went up after the next-door neighbor, who wanted to buy the pie-shaped corner lot, made a low-ball offer to the property owner. The property owner was so mad at the offer he built the house to get back at his neighbor, who eventually ended up moving. \n \n \n \n Horton, who has owned the home since 2000, says with all its quirks - like having to stand off to the side to make enough room to open the oven door - the local legend must be true. \n \n \n \n \"Of course I buy into it,\" she says. \n \n \n \n Eugene Smith, a retired professor at the University of Washington, lived in Montlake for 40 years. Fascinated by local history, in 2004 Smith wrote a book about Montlake's history, devoting one of the chapters to what he calls the eclectic collection of houses seen throughout the neighborhood. \n \n \n \n \"(The Montlake Spite House) was certainly the oddest of all the bungalows,\" Smith says. \"It was the smallest, most peculiar shape.\" \n \n \n \n Smith says he was intrigued by the asymmetry of the spite house and came up with his own version of its creation. \n \n \n \n \"What I concluded, since I wasn't able to track down any particular feuds or hate, was that someone came up with a design to fit the lot and built it so it didn't interfere with anyone's view,\" Smith says. \n \n \n \n It turns out Montlake's Spite House doesn't stand alone. A handful of stories have been published from across the country featuring similar cases where a home has been built, added-on to or painted to deliberately irritate and annoy others - in many cases a neighbor or city entity. \n \n \n \n The Montlake Spite House is currently listed for sale at $397,500 and is touted as the \"perfect condo alternativein one of Seattle's best neighborhoods.\" \n \n \n \n The home, currently unoccupied, previously sold for $239,500 in 2000, according to Redfin. ||||| You might think that a little wedge-shaped house built explicitly to aggravate someone would be a tough sell. \n \n Not in Seattle. Listed at $397,500, the home was just snapped up over the weekend, the real estate agent told Yahoo Homes, after spending only a couple of weeks on the market. \"We had quite the interest!\" she told us. (A local news story published Tuesday and picked up internationally might have helped the quick sale.) \n \n Click here or on a photo to go to a slideshow. \n \n Locals call it the Montlake Spite House. Legend has it that the home, on a mere sliver of a lot, was built by: \n \n \u2022 A woman who won only a bit of yard in a divorce settlement, while her ex got the rest of the property, including the (normal-shaped) house they'd shared. Or ... \n \n \u2022 A landowner who was furious when the neighbor who owned the adjacent (normal-sized) lot made him a lowball offer on the sliver. Or ... \n \n \u2022 A traveler who, while visiting Germany, gave permission for someone to build on the lot -- with the provision that enough land be left for a second house. When the traveler returned, he discovered that the new house took a lot more space than he'd expected, so, \u201cout of spite, he [the landowner] built that funny little pie-shaped home\" as an obstacle, the current homeowner told KPLU-FM's Martha Kang. \u201cI also heard that back when it was first built, the side that was facing the neighbor had been painted black.\u201d \n \n The house at 2022 24th Avenue East has 830 square feet, and it's just 55 inches wide at its narrowest point. The house is shaped like a right triangle with its sharpest point slightly blunted -- that's the 55-inch-wide edge, where a mudroom and exit door lead into the yard. The longest side of the triangle (the hypotenuse) faces the street, with the entrance placed roughly at its center. \n \n Click here or on a photo to go to a slideshow. \n \n Lisa Horton, the current homeowner, told KPLU that the shape of the house was never much of an impediment, except when she was cooking: The kitchen is toward the narrow end of the house, so you can't stand in front of the oven when you open it; you have to stand to the side. ||||| It looks like such a sweet home. But once you know the history of this pie slice-shaped dwelling, you'll see why it's nicknamed the Seattle Spite House and you'll learn there are laws to prevent you from intentionally building to block views, light or access that your neighbor enjoys. \n \n Washington State spite law 7.40.030: Malicious erection of structure may be enjoined. An injunction may be granted to restrain the malicious erection, by any owner or lessee of land, of any structure intended to spite, injure or annoy an adjoining proprietor. And where any owner or lessee of land has maliciously erected such a structure with such intent, a mandatory injunction will lie to compel its abatement and removal. \n \n In legalese - forgive me - an act like that is called a \"malicious erection.\" \n \n Still, there are so many examples of cranky citizen's constructions to irritate adjacent landowners that Wikipedia has an entry for both a spite house and the less-expensive revenge, a spite fence. \n \n Warring neighbors have painted exterior walls garish colors, posted unsightly signs and tried other ways to pique the people nearby. But it's expensive, and now illegal, to block with a vengeance. \n \n The tiny Seattle spite house at 2022 24th Ave. E, which is now listed for sale at $519,900, was built in 1925. Stories of its origin vary, but all focus on serious payback. \n \n The most popular rumor centers on a wacky divorce case in which a judge awarded the house to the husband and a sliver of the property - the 3,090-square-foot front yard - to the wife. \n \n Some say out of spite, she squeezed a pie slice-shaped structure onto her odd corner lot, which dictated that one end only be 55 inches wide. In this mini mudroom, you can stretch out your arms and touch opposite walls. \n \n The footprint widens a little in the cramped kitchen, but not enough to stand in front of the oven and open the oven door. The living room in the center of the triangle house offers more elbow room. Finally, at the end, the master suite is a luxurious 15 feet wide. \n \n Hallways? Forget it. But there is a daylight basement/garage conversion. Buried beneath the main floor is a bedroom and bath that benefit from carriage doors that open to the outdoors. The center of the subterranean space is a cozy seating room. At the almost pointed, narrow end is an elevated platform with a mattress. Tiny house dwellers would feel right at home here. \n \n At 860 square feet, the listing price breaks down to $605 a square foot, about three times the median in Portland. \n \n That's pricey. So is the idea of constructing a wall or something larger to retaliate. Building codes and expenses squelch many planned spite houses. Instead, may we suggest calling a neighborhood mediator? \n \n - Janet Eastman \n \n jeastman@oregonian.com \n \n 503-799-8739 \n \n @janeteastman",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 From the front, a half-million-dollar home on the Re/Max website looks like a quaint Spanish Revival in the heart of Seattle. Head to the side for a different perspective, and you'll see appearances are deceiving. You're looking at what Yahoo says locals call the \"Montlake Spite House,\" an 860-square-foot sliver of a house that's legendary even among tiny houses. The front of the pie-shaped home built in 1925 is just 15 feet wide, while the back comes in at under 5 feet wide, KOMO reported in 2013, the last time the house was up for sale. Eugene Smith, a retired professor at the University of Washington who wrote a book on area history, says the wedge-like residence \"was certainly the oddest of all the bungalows\" in the area. \"It was the smallest, most peculiar shape,\" he told KOMO. And the story behind its supposedly spiteful construction is just as strange as its shape. Yahoo dug up a few origin tales, including that it may have been built by an enraged landowner to spite a neighbor for a lowball offer on the land, per the Stranger. It also may have been a revenge move by a long-ago owner, said to have given permission for someone to build a home while he was traveling, as long as there was room left for his own house, which \u2026 there wasn't, really, Quirksee has reported. But one of the catchiest stories, offered by the Oregonian, claims a divorce judge awarded the original, larger home to the husband, and a tiny portion of land to the wife, who then built this minuscule abode to be up in her ex's face. These days there's a law on the books against such a \"malicious erection,\" which involves building a structure to purposely \"spite, injure or annoy\" neighbors by blocking their view, access, or light.

    "document": "CAIRO/ISMAILIA, Egypt Five people were shot dead in the Egyptian city of Suez during nationwide protests against President Mohamed Mursi on Friday, the second anniversary of the uprising that toppled Hosni Mubarak. \n \n One of the dead was a member of the security forces, medics said. Another 280 civilians and 55 security personnel were injured, officials said, in demonstrations fuelled by anger at the president and his Islamist allies in the Muslim Brotherhood. \n \n Thousands of opponents of Mursi massed in Cairo's Tahrir Square - the cradle of the revolt against Mubarak - to rekindle the demands of a revolution they say has been hijacked by Islamists who have betrayed its goals. \n \n Street battles erupted in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Port Said. Arsonists attacked at least two state-owned buildings as symbols of government were targeted. An office used by the Muslim Brotherhood's political party was also torched. \n \n The January 25 anniversary laid bare the divide between the Islamists and their secular rivals. \n \n This schism is hindering the efforts of Mursi, elected in June, to revive an economy in crisis and reverse a plunge in Egypt's currency by enticing back investors and tourists. \n \n Inspired by the popular uprising in Tunisia, Egypt's revolution spurred further revolts across the Arab world. But the sense of common purpose that united Egyptians two years ago has given way to internal strife that had already triggered bloody street battles last month. \n \n \"Our revolution is continuing. We reject the domination of any party over this state. We say no to the Brotherhood state,\" Hamdeen Sabahy, a popular leftist leader, told Reuters. \n \n The Brotherhood decided against mobilizing for the anniversary, wary of the scope for more conflict after December's violence, stoked by Mursi's decision to fast-track an Islamist-tinged constitution rejected by his opponents. \n \n The Brotherhood denies accusations that it is seeking to dominate Egypt, labeling them a smear campaign by its rivals. \n \n DEATH IN SUEZ \n \n There were conflicting accounts of the lethal shooting in Suez. Some witnesses said security forces had opened fire in response to gunfire from masked men. \n \n News of the deaths capped a day of violence which started in the early hours. Before dawn in Cairo, police battled protesters who threw petrol bombs and firecrackers as they approached a wall blocking access to government buildings near Tahrir Square. \n \n Clouds of tear gas filled the air. At one point, riot police used one of the incendiaries thrown at them to set ablaze at least two tents erected by youths, a Reuters witness said. \n \n Skirmishes between stone-throwing youths and the police continued in streets around the square into the day. Ambulances ferried away a steady stream of casualties. \n \n Protesters echoed the chants of 2011's historic 18-day uprising. \"The people want to bring down the regime,\" they chanted. \"Leave! Leave! Leave!\" chanted others as they marched towards the square. \n \n \"We are not here to celebrate but to force those in power to submit to the will of the people. Egypt now must never be like Egypt during Mubarak's rule,\" said Mohamed Fahmy, an activist. \n \n There were similar scenes in Suez and Alexandria, where protesters and riot police clashed near local government offices. Black smoke billowed from tires set ablaze by youths. \n \n In Cairo, police fired tear gas to disperse a few dozen protesters trying to remove barbed-wire barriers protecting the presidential palace, witnesses said. A few masked men got as far as the gates before they were beaten back. \n \n Tear gas was also fired at protesters who tried to remove metal barriers outside the state television building. \n \n Outside Cairo, protesters broke into the offices of provincial governors in Ismailia and Kafr el-Sheikh in the Nile Delta. A local government building was torched in the Nile Delta city of al-Mahalla al-Kubra. \n \n BADIE CALLS FOR \"PRACTICAL, SERIOUS COMPETITION\" \n \n With an eye on parliamentary elections likely to begin in April, the Brotherhood marked the anniversary with a charity drive across the nation. It plans to deliver medical aid to one million people and distribute affordable basic foodstuffs. \n \n Writing in Al-Ahram, Egypt's flagship state-run daily, Brotherhood leader Mohamed Badie said the country was in need of \"practical, serious competition\" to reform the corrupt state left by the Mubarak era. \n \n \"The differences of opinion and vision that Egypt is passing through is a characteristic at the core of transitions from dictatorship to democracy, and clearly expresses the variety of Egyptian culture,\" he wrote. \n \n Mursi's opponents say he and his group are seeking to dominate the post-Mubarak order. They accuse him of showing some of the autocratic impulses of the deposed leader by, for example, driving through the new constitution last month. \n \n \"I am taking part in today's marches to reject the warped constitution, the 'Brotherhoodisation' of the state, the attack on the rule of law, and the disregard of the president and his government for the demands for social justice,\" Amr Hamzawy, a prominent liberal politician, wrote on his Twitter feed. \n \n The Brotherhood says its rivals are failing to respect the rules of the new democracy that put the Islamists in the driving seat via free elections. \n \n Six months into office, Mursi is also being held responsible for an economic crisis caused by two years of turmoil. The Egyptian pound has sunk to record lows against the dollar. \n \n The parties that called for Friday's protests list demands including a complete overhaul of the constitution. \n \n Critics say the constitution, which was approved in a referendum, offers inadequate protection for human rights, grants the president too many privileges and fails to curb the power of a military establishment supreme in the Mubarak era. \n \n Mursi's supporters say enacting the constitution quickly was crucial to restoring stability needed for economic recovery. \n \n (Additional reporting by Ahmed el-Shemi, Ashraf Fahim, Marwa Awad, Shaimaa Fayed and Yasmine Saleh in Cairo and Abdel Rahman Youssef in Alexandria; Writing by Tom Perry; Editing by Robert Woodward) ||||| FILE - In this Wednesday, Feb. 2, 2011 file photo, A supporter of President Hosni Mubarak, on camel, fights with anti-Mubarak protesters in Cairo, Egypt.

Goldfein, while traveling Saturday morning to the annual conference of the National Guard Association of the United States in Louisville, Ky., ruled out speculation the aircraft involved may have been an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. \n \n \"I can definitely say it was not an F-35,\" he told a Military.com reporter accompanying him on the trip. \n \n In an article on the website of The Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland, Schultz was identified as a 1991 graduate of Annapolis High School and a former civilian test pilot who received multiple graduate degrees before joining the Air Force in 2001. \n \n A YouCaring page to establish a memorial fund for Schultz's family states he received six degrees, including a doctorate in aerospace engineering from the California Institute of Technology and a master's of business administration from Penn State University. \n \n Schultz was a U.S. Air Force combat veteran and test pilot with over 2,000 hours flying numerous aircraft, including the F-35 and CF-18, Canada's variant of the F/A-18 Hornet, and the F-15E, in which he flew more than 50 close air support missions in Afghanistan, according to the page. \n \n He also held management positions, serving as director of operations and exchange officer at the Canadian Forces Flight Test Center, and performed systems engineering for the Airborne Laser program, the page states. \n \n Prior to joining the military, Schultz was the senior scientist and business development manger at the Pratt & Whitney Seattle Aerosciences Center, and a rotary wing flight test engineer at the Naval Air Warfare Center, it states. \n \n He's survived by a wife, Julie, and five children, Noah, Elijah, Zion, OliviaMae, and Naomi; parents Larry and Linda Schultz of Annapolis; brother Lars (his children Ava and Tristan) of Alexandria, Virginia; and aunts, uncles, nieces, and nephews, according to the YouCaring page. \n \n Schultz in 2011 was also named the 28th pilot to fly the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a stealthy fifth-generation fighter jet made by Lockheed Martin Corp., according to information released by the Air Force and the manufacturer. \n \n The F-35 is the Pentagon's most expensive weapons acquisition program, estimated to cost more than $400 billion to develop and buy more than 2,400 of the single-engine fighters. \n \n While the program has encountered cost overruns, schedule delays and mishaps in decades of development, including engine fires -- one in 2016 resulted in burns to a pilot's head, neck and face -- the airframe hasn't yet experienced a fatal accident. \n \n The deadly crash occurred a day before a pair of A-10 Thunderbolt II ground-attack aircraft crashed at the same training range. Both pilots safely ejected in that incident, according to a separate release from Nellis issued Thursday. \n \n The A-10C jets, known as Warthogs, from the 57th Wing at Nellis were also on a routine training mission when they went down around 8 p.m. The service didn't say whether the planes collided. \n \n It wasn't immediately clear why Friday's release came three days after an accident involving a fatality. \n \n Both mishaps are under investigation. \n \n \"These are separate incidents and both are currently under investigation to determine their causes,\" Sukach said in a separate email. \n \n -- Oriana Pawlyk can be reached at oriana.pawlyk@military.com.

The researchers used the semisynthetic psychedelic drug to facilitate discussions about the cancer patients' fears of dying. The patients who took LSD, most of whom were terminally ill, experienced 10-hour-long supervised \"trips.\" One patient described the trips to The New York Times as a \"mystical experience,\" where \"the major part was pure distress at all the memories I had successfully forgotten for decades.\" \n \n These periods of distress are regarded as therapeutically valuable because they allow patients to address their memories and the emotions they evoke.

Dr. Peter Gasser's study involved 12 people who were dying, most of terminal cancer, and suffering from \"deep anxiety,\" the Seattle Times reports. After undergoing talk therapy, eight of the patients were given a 200-microgram dose of LSD designed to \"produce the full spectrum of a typical LSD experience\" on two occasions; the other four received a 20-microgram \"active placebo\" that wasn't expected to have an impact. They took their 10-hour \"trips\" in Gasser's office, and, he says, \"Their anxiety went down and stayed down.\" Specifically, subjects who received full doses of LSD saw a 20% improvement in their anxiety symptoms, and for those who were still alive a year later, the improvement had lasted, the New York Times reports. Those who took the placebo reported increased anxiety. It doesn't sound like a comforting experience at first: The Verge says the purpose of administering the psychedelic drug was to \"facilitate discussions about the patients' fears of dying,\" and one patient reports that \"the major part was pure distress at all these memories I had successfully forgotten for decades. These painful feelings, regrets, this fear of death.\" But he talked about all that with Gasser, something he'd found difficult prior to the trip; the Times refers to such distress as \"therapeutically valuable,\" and many subjects had similar experiences.

    "document": "Former President George W. Bush had his official presidential portrait unveiled at a special ceremony at the White House today. It\u2019s fairly standard issue: Bush stands in the Oval Office, his hands on a chair, with a look that Roland Barthes noted decades ago is typical of political portraits . (\u201cThe gaze is lost nobly in the future, it does not confront, it soars and fertilizes some other domain, which is chastely left undefined.\u201d) You can see the new portrait over at Talking Points Memo . \n \n One detail stands out, though: President Bush\u2019s favorite painting, the one he kept by his desk, and the one for which he named his 1999 autobiography, A Charge to Keep . Bush loved to regale visitors with what he thought was the story behind the painting, telling how it depicted the famous circuit riders who in the nineteenth century spread the message of Methodism across the Alleghenies. Bush, a Methodist since the 1970s, identified with the quest of the noble cowboy missionary, and visitors often noted the resemblance between Bush and the lead rider. There\u2019s only one problem with that story: As Slate Group editor-in-chief Jacob Weisberg wrote in his 2008 book The Bush Tragedy , \u201cthat is not the title, message, or meaning of the painting.\u201d * Weisberg explains: \n \n Whether or not Bush ever learned the true story behind the painting seems to be unclear, but if so, he\u2019s sticking to his guns, unwanted ironies be damned. Indeed, President Bush seems determined to ride off with Koerner\u2019s painting into history. \n \n \n \n *Update, June 1, 2012: While Bush\u2019s story of the painting\u2019s origins still appears to be false, aspects of Weisberg\u2019s account have also been disputed. As University of Illinois professor Cara Finnegan points out on her blog First Efforts, an illustration that ran with the horse thief story \u201cThe Slipper Tongue\u201d in The Saturday Evening Post is actually a very similar-looking but different Koerner composition, also depicting a man working his way up a hill on a horse. The Google Books archive, similarly, shows the same similar-looking but different Koerner illustration. \n \n \n \n Contacted about the dispute, Weisberg agreed that he may have confused the two illustrations, and explained that his photocopy of \u201cThe Slipper Tongue\u201d may simply have been blurry. \n \n \n \n Not disputed by Finnegan is the later appearance of the composition, also mentioned in Weisberg\u2019s book, with the 1918 Country Gentleman story \u201cA Charge to Keep.\u201d Both Finnegan and Weisberg note that this illustration, now the first confirmed appearance of the painting, is not about Methodist missionaries either. As Weisberg points out, the story\u2014about a son\u2019s fight to keep his land, inherited from his father, from \u201crapacious timber barons\u201d\u2014may contain a different irony altogether. \n \n ||||| President Obama welcomed his predecessor back to the White House on Thursday for the unveiling of the official George W. Bush and Laura Bush portraits. As we watched the two men interact graciously during the event, we could not help but wonder: Where did it come from? \n \n Not the amity. Obama and Bush are members of the presidents\u2019 club and have more in common with each other than with the leaders of their respective parties. We mean the picture itself. Who chooses the artists for official presidential portraits, and how? Who pays for the painting \u2013 taxpayers, private citizens, or presidents themselves? \n \n Well, presidents choose their own painters. But it\u2019s not an easy process. Sometimes things don\u2019t work out \u2013 Lyndon B. Johnson picked a second artist after the first produced a painting he thought \u201cugly\u201d in all ways. And there are many applicants. Portfolios flood into the White House from artists, their agents, galleries, staff members, friends, and family. \n \n During the Clinton administration, Hillary Rodham Clinton reviewed these submissions. The first lady sought advice from the White House curator and the director of the National Portrait Gallery, according to an article by White House curator emeritus Betty C. Monkman in the journal White House History. \n \n After Clinton won reelection, Mrs. Clinton began interviewing artists, sometimes with the president in tow. Just before leaving office Bill Clinton picked the Alabama-born Simmie Knox to produce his official likeness. After seeing the likeness \u2013 which depicts a rather formal Clinton standing in the Oval Office \u2013 Mrs. Clinton picked Knox for her official first lady portrait as well. \n \n Taxpayers don\u2019t foot the bill for this art. At least, not all taxpayers do. They\u2019re paid for via private donations channeled through the nonprofit White House Historical Association. \n \n \u201cWe have for years been underwriting the cost of official presidential portraits,\u201d says Maria Downs, WHCA director of public affairs. \n \n This is a fairly recent phenomenon. Prior to the historical association\u2019s founding in 1961, there was no organized effort to produce a line of presidential and first lady portraits for the White House itself. Well into the twentieth century the commission of official portraits was a \u201chaphazard affair,\u201d according to former curator Ms. Monkman. \n \n In 1800, for instance, Congress allocated $700 to purchase a portrait of the recently deceased George Washington. This paid for what has since become one of the icons of American art, indeed one of the touchstones of American history \u2013 the full-length \u201cLansdowne\u201d portrait by Gilbert Stuart. \n \n Four years after Abraham Lincoln\u2019s death, Congress allocated funds for a Lincoln portrait competition. President Ulysses S. Grant picked the winner: a full-length portrait by Chicago artist William Cogswell. Ironically, today a losing effort from that contest is better known.

He is awaiting trial on charges that he attacked and attempted to kill a woman in Fairfax City in 2005; authorities have said that they found Matthew\u2019s DNA under one of the victim\u2019s fingernails. \n \n Graham, a U-Va. sophomore who graduated from West Potomac High School, disappeared after a night out in Charlottesville on Sept. 12. Police said she had been socializing with friends earlier in the night but left the group with plans to meet up with them later. She never showed up and apparently became disoriented while walking through Charlottesville. \n \n Police said witnesses saw Matthew with his arm around Graham at a downtown mall about 1 a.m. Sept. 13, and surveillance video recordings show the two walking together.

(Associated Press) \n \n Formally embarking on his second term, President Barack Obama will take the oath of office Sunday surrounded by family in an intimate inauguration at the White House, 24 hours before re-enacting the ceremony before an excited crowd of hundreds of thousands outdoors at the Capitol. \n \n The subdued swearing-in is a function of the calendar and the Constitution, which says presidents automatically begin their new terms at noon on Jan. 20. Because that date fell this year on a Sunday _ a day on which inaugural ceremonies historically are not held _ organizers scheduled a second, public swearing-in for Monday. \n \n A crowd of up to 800,000 people is expected to gather on the National Mall to witness that event, which will take place on the Capitol's red, white and blue bunting-draped west front. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts, who famously flubbed the oath of office that Obama took in 2009, will swear the president in both days. \n \n Vice President Joe Biden will also be sworn in Sunday in a small, early morning ceremony at the Naval Observatory, his official residence. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was appointed by Obama during his first term, will administer the oath of office to the vice president. \n \n Once the celebrations are over, Obama will plunge into a second-term agenda still dominated by the economy, which slowly churned out of recession during his first four years in office. The president will also seek to cement his legacy with sweeping domestic changes, pledging to achieve both an immigration overhaul and stricter gun laws despite opposition from a divided Congress. \n \n But for one weekend at least, Washington was putting politics aside. Obama called the nation's inaugural traditions \"a symbol of how our democracy works and how we peacefully transfer power.\" \n \n \"But it should also be an affirmation that we're all in this together,\" he said Saturday, as he opened a weekend of inaugural activities at a Washington elementary school. \n \n Only a small group of family members is expected to attend Obama's Sunday swearing-in, including first lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha. A small group of reporters will also be in the room to witness the event. \n \n Roberts will administer the oath of office shortly before noon in the White House Blue Room, an oval space with majestic views of the South Lawn and the Washington Monument. Named for the color of the drapes, upholstery and carpet, the Blue Room is not typically used for ceremonies and instead has primarily been a reception room as well as the site of the only presidential wedding held in the White House, between then-President Grover Cleveland and Frances Folsum in 1886. \n \n Later Sunday, Obama and Biden will speak at an inaugural reception attended by supporters. \n \n But the president will save his most expansive remarks for Monday, when he delivers his second inaugural address to the crowd gathered on the Mall and millions more watching across the country and the world. Obama started working on the speech in early December and was still tinkering with it into the weekend, aides said. \n \n The president's address will set the stage for the policy objectives he seeks to achieve in his second term, including speeding up the economic recovery, passing comprehensive immigration and gun control measures and ending the war in Afghanistan. However, aides said Obama would save the specifics of those agenda items for his Feb. 12 State of the Union address. \n \n The president launched a weekend of inaugural activities Saturday by heading up a National Day of Service. Along with his family, Obama helped hundreds of volunteers spruce up a Washington area elementary school. \n \n His shirt sleeves rolled up, Obama donned a pair of rubber gloves, picked up a paint brush and helped volunteers stain a bookshelf. \n \n Obama added the service event to the inaugural schedule in 2009 and is hoping it becomes a tradition followed for future presidents. \n \n Mrs. Obama, speaking to volunteers Sunday, espoused the importance of giving back in the midst of the weekend of pomp, circumstance and celebration. \n \n \"The reason why we're here, why we're standing here, why we're able to celebrate this weekend is because a lot of people worked hard and supported us, and we've got a job to do and this is a symbol of the kind of work that we need to be doing the next four years,\" Michelle Obama said at Burrville Elementary. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Julie Pace at http://twitter.com/jpaceDC ||||| Barack Obama and John Roberts were all smiles when the chief justice swore in the president on Sunday \u2014 a cordial performance they\u2019ll likely repeat during the public swearing-in on Monday. \n \n But the serene tableau obscures the tumultuous relationship between the two since their first awkward public interaction during the botched oath of office four years ago. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Inauguration 2013: Obama official swearing-in \n \n On Sunday, Roberts read the oath from a piece of paper \u2014 and both men seemed relieved when it was over.

For much of Obama\u2019s first four years in office, the pair seemed to be at loggerheads \u2014 particularly after the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision upheld corporations\u2019 right to spend money on elections. Obama trashed the ruling at his State of the Union Address with Roberts and six other justices sitting right in front of him. \n \n The tension lifted briefly and dramatically last June, when Roberts joined with Democrats on the court to uphold a pivotal part of Obama\u2019s signature health care reform law, the individual mandate. But experts predict the Roberts-led court will continue to challenge the president\u2019s policies in areas that will shape the future of the nation, including affirmative action, immigration and the environment. \n \n (PHOTOS: Obama\u2019s first term) \n \n And that means the two men, each with a keen sense of his place in history, are likely to clash again during Obama\u2019s second term. \n \n \u201cWhen you have a president and a chief justice of distinctly opposing philosophies, that\u2019s a recipe for conflict, and it has been one, and it will be one,\u201d said Jeffrey Toobin, an author of several books on the court and a legal analyst for CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t think there has been a level of ideological conflict between the president and the chief justice like this since the \u201930s.\u201d \n \n Other analysts say it\u2019s still too early to say whether the Obama-Roberts rivalry is destined for the history books. \n \n \u201cThe Obama and Roberts differences are real and meaningful and will probably find expression in a number of other important cases over the next four years,\u201d said Jeff Shesol, author of \u201cSupreme Power: Franklin Roosevelt vs. The Supreme Court.\u201d \u201cWhether it rises to the level of other kinds of presidential-judicial rivalries is something we\u2019ll probably have to judge in retrospect.\u201d \n \n Obama and Roberts\u2019s relationship got off to a famously rocky start during the 2009 Inauguration, when Obama jumped in prematurely to recite the oath and the chief justice then mangled the wording. Both men reportedly apologized for the episode, which Roberts may have exacerbated by trying to recite the oath by memory. The White House summoned him to the Map Room for a do-over the next day, just to make sure Obama was officially the president. \n \n (PHOTOS: 10 inaugural controversies from history) \n \n The first big flash point came about a year later, when the Supreme Court handed down the Citizens United decision. Obama immediately denounced it as \u201ca green light to a new stampede of special interest money in our politics\u201d and \u201ca major victory for big oil, Wall Street banks, health insurance companies and the other powerful interests that marshal their power every day in Washington to drown out the voices of everyday Americans.\u201d",

Today, the glassy-eyed cherubs that are still around stand about 2 feet tall; they have wooden limbs and a metal body; and they sound supercreepy. (If you're looking for a soundtrack to your nightmares, listen to the audio story above.) Edison built and sold about 500 of them back in 1890. Now, new technology has made hearing them possible for the first time in decades. \n \n Jerry Fabris, who curates sound recordings at the Thomas Edison National Historical Park, says part of what makes the recordings so unsettling is that they were most likely read by a female factory worker imitating a little girl. (For example: Here's a shrieking recitation of \"A Child's Prayer\" that you will never unhear.) \n \n Fabris says Edison was, for the first time, trying to market the then-brand-new wax cylinder phonograph for people to use at home, and he thought the best vehicle would be a doll. Its metal body held a miniature phonograph that was spring-activated by a crank sticking out of the doll's back. Edison knew the sound quality was raw, so he had the dolls recite recognizable verses like \"Hickory Dickory Dock.\" \n \n i itoggle caption John Reed/National Park Service John Reed/National Park Service \n \n The recordings didn't sound much better in 1890 than they do today. Fabris says, \"Edison himself thought they were unpleasant.\" And so did everyone else. The dolls flopped in the market, not because people thought they were creepy but because they were expensive \u2014 about $200 in today's money. People also thought the dolls weren't lifelike enough; they wanted moving mouths and for the dolls' voices to be understandable. Edison stopped making the dolls after about a month. \n \n \"After the business failed, he referred to them as 'little monsters,' \" Fabris says. \n \n And that raises a larger question: Why do we find talking dolls so scary? Talking toys occupy a horror subgenre so established that it's led to parodies. According to Georgetown University horror scholar Caetlin Benson-Allott, a talking toy belongs in an unsettling middle space: It's human, but not that human. \n \n \"It's both familiar and different,\" she says, \"and we don't kind of understand if it's entirely dead or entirely alive.\" \n \n It's what Sigmund Freud called \"the uncanny,\" and we can feel it as a subconscious holdover from childhood, when we pretended our dolls were real. Even as knowing grown-ups, Benson-Allott says, there's a lurking apprehension \"that that doll is actually alive and watching me.\" \n \n She says we've probably freaked ourselves out with dolls for as long as we've used dolls \u2014 in ritual and in play. From a talking doll to technology, she says, when we give anything power there's a sense \u2014 even a fear \u2014 that that power might turn back on us. ||||| Published on May 5, 2015 \n \n Thomas Edison's talking dolls contain some of the oldest surviving voice recordings.

(Edison reportedly later referred to the failed dolls as \"little monsters.\") Some still exist, but they've been silent for years. Robin and Joan Rolfs, owners of two dolls, feared that operating the cranks on their backs could break them, the New York Times reports. Their voices came from recordings on wax cylinders, but if a doll's phonograph needle hit the cylinder again today, it could ruin it. The good news, at least for fans of extremely creepy 19th-century recordings, is that we can finally hear them again. That's thanks to the work of a physicist and an engineer, who developed a technology that uses a microscope to study the grooves on the cylinders before they are re-created as computer images and, ultimately, extremely accurate sounds. The cylinders don't have to be touched at all, the Times notes. \"We are now hearing sounds from history that I did not expect to hear in my lifetime,\" the curator of the Thomas Edison National Historical Park tells the paper.

She said Germany had made a promise to increase defence over the next decade and would fulfil that commitment rather than be forced into the faster rises that Trump is looking for. \n \n Merkel said the focus on defence spending could be misleading. Even if Germany was to spend more, there was not the military capacity available to invest in. She added that Germany saw spending on development in countries in Africa and elsewhere as being as vital to security as military spending. \n \n The conference marks the first major meeting between the Trump administration and leaders from across Europe since Trump took office. \n \n Pence went further than the US defence secretary, James Mattis, at Nato headquarters on Wednesday in warning Nato allies to stump up more. He said: \u201cAs of this moment, the US and only four other Nato members meet that basic standard.\u201d \n \n Those four countries are the UK, Estonia, Greece and Poland. The other 23 Nato members do not meet the target of spending 2% of GDP on defence. \n \n In a thinly veiled warning, Pence said that while the US was bound by Nato\u2019s article five \u2013 an attack on one member would be an attack on all \u2013 he also reminded the audience that article three contained a commitment to sharing the financial burden, echoing Trump\u2019s warning last year that he did not feel bound to come to the defence of countries that did not pay their share. \n \n Pence peppered his speech with regular references to Trump, stressing that he was delivering messages from the president.

    "document": "Should the campus police at the University of Central Florida ever need a grenade launcher, one sits waiting in the department\u2019s armory. Repurposed to fire tear-gas canisters, the weapon was used several years ago for training exercises, according to Richard Beary, the university\u2019s chief of police. It hasn\u2019t left storage since. \n \n At Central Florida, which has an enrollment of nearly 60,000 and a Division I football team, the device was acquired, a police spokeswoman said, for \u201csecurity and crowd control.\u201d But the university\u2019s police force isn\u2019t the only one to have come upon a grenade launcher. Hinds Community College\u2014located in western Mississippi, with a student population of 11,000\u2014had one too. (Campus police officers at Hinds declined to comment. A woman who worked for the department but declined to identify herself said that the launcher had been repurposed to shoot flares but that the college no longer possessed it.) \n \n Both institutions received their launchers from the same source: the Department of Defense. At least 117 colleges have acquired equipment from the department through a federal program, known as the 1033 program, that transfers military surplus to law-enforcement agencies across the country, according to records The Chronicle received after filing Freedom of Information requests with state governments (see table of equipment). \n \n Campus police departments have used the program to obtain military equipment as mundane as men\u2019s trousers (Yale University) and as serious as a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle (Ohio State University). Along with the grenade launcher, Central Florida acquired 23 M-16 assault rifles from the Department of Defense. \n \n Ask participants in the program, and they\u2019ll say it provides departments, particularly those with limited budgets like campus police forces, with necessary gear at very little cost (colleges pay only for shipping). Responsible departments, advocates say, develop plans for specific instances in which the equipment will be used\u2014crowd-control situations, say, or active-shooter incidents like the Virginia Tech massacre. Outside of those cases, community members are unlikely to know that the gear even exists. \n \n But on campus and off, there are detractors. Some argue that the procurement of tactical gear doesn\u2019t help with the types of crimes that occur more frequently on college campuses, like alcohol-related incidents and sexual assault. Others worry that military equipment is an especially poor fit for college campuses, fearing that it may have a chilling effect on free expression. \n \n The 1033 program has received heightened scrutiny in the wake of protests in Ferguson, Mo. After the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, reporters and phone-wielding protesters captured images of police officers armed with military-grade guns, camouflage, and armored vehicles. Observers characterized the police response as heavy-handed and criticized officers for improperly using their weaponry. \n \n In Washington renewed attention to the transfer of military weapons has led some lawmakers to call for a review of the 1033 program. Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri who heads the oversight subcommittee for the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, led a hearing on Tuesday to consider revisions in the program. She suggested that local police departments that enjoy cost savings from free military equipment be required to receive 200 hours of training. \n \n \u201cIf we\u2019re gonna give you money, we\u2019re going to make you jump through a few hoops first,\u201d she said. \n \n Hilary O. Shelton, director of the NAACP\u2019s Washington bureau, told the committee that if the 1033 program is to be continued, it should be restructured to focus on \u201cprotecting and serving citizens.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has said he plans to review the 1033 program before the Senate considers reauthorizing the annual military-spending bill. President Obama has also called for a review. \n \n Ms. McCaskill, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Obama joined Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, and Rep. Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia, in questioning the program. In an announcement that he would formally draft a bill in September imposing limits on the transfer of certain equipment\u2014including armored vehicles and large-caliber weapons\u2014Mr. Johnson mocked Ohio State\u2019s procurement of its heavy-duty vehicle, known as an MRAP, through the 1033 program. \n \n \"Apparently, college kids are getting too rowdy,\" Mr. Johnson said. \n \n Significant Savings \n \n The scrutiny may be increasing now, but the 1033 program has been available to colleges for quite some time. In 1990, Congress passed a version of the National Defense Authorization Act that allowed for the transfer of excess Department of Defense equipment to federal and state agencies if gear was deemed \u201csuitable for use by such agencies in counter-drug activities.\u201d In 1996 the law was reauthorized, with Section 1033 allowing for the transfer of equipment for terrorism-related purposes as well. \n \n Now more than 8,000 federal and state law-enforcement agencies\u2014many campus police departments among them\u2014are eligible to participate. Participating agencies don\u2019t buy equipment; they are given it. They are prohibited from reselling or leasing the gear, and required to provide updates on the location of \u201ctactical\u201d gear, like armored vehicles and weaponry. When a police department decides a piece of equipment has outlived its usefulness, it is returned to the government. \n \n After the buildup and winding down of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the amount of surplus equipment available to law-enforcement agencies increased drastically. At colleges, where terrorist attacks and shootouts with drug cartels are virtually unheard of, the active-shooter scenario became the primary justification for colleges to acquire tactical gear. \n \n Central Florida got eight of its M-16 assault rifles in 2011, and 15 more were transferred to the department in February of the following year. At campus police departments, much like their counterparts at the local, state, and federal level, the most popular weapon procured through the 1033 program is the M-16 assault rifle. \n \n At least 60 institutions have acquired M-16s through the program. Arizona State University holds the most, with 70 in its arsenal, followed by Florida International University and the University of Maryland with 50 M-16s each. Central Florida received its grenade launcher in 2008; Hinds acquired its in 2006. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Gear through the 1033 program is free to participating departments, with receiving agencies having to pay only delivery and maintenance costs. The University of Louisiana at Monroe paid $507.43 for 12 M-16 rifles; the University of Alabama at Huntsville paid $220.40 for the transfer and shipping of five M-16s. \n \n \u201cFor me, this is a cost savings for taxpayers,\u201d said Jen Day Shaw, associate vice president and dean of students at the University of Florida and chair of the Campus Safety Knowledge Community, a forum for members of Naspa: Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education. When police departments \u201chave the ability to get equipment that will help them do their jobs at a greatly reduced price,\u201d Ms. Shaw said, \u201cit is a benefit for the whole campus.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt is a force multiplier for us,\u201d said David Perry, chief of police at Florida State University and president of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators. \u201cTypically, we are not staffed at optimum levels. We are not given budgets comparable to some large cities and municipalities, so we need to find ways to make it reach.\u201d \n \n Indeed, many police departments use the 1033 program to acquire basic supplies along with tactical equipment. \u201cAside from body armor and weapons,\u201d Mr. Perry said, \u201cthere is furniture, hand sanitizers, bandages. There are all types of equipment, materials, and supplies we need to support our overall mission.\u201d \n \n 'Better to Be Prepared' \n \n At Central Florida, Chief Beary said, M-16 rifles are stored in vehicles for emergencies, like the one his officers responded to at midnight on March 18, 2013. Answering a call for a pulled fire alarm, officers eventually raided the dormitory room of James Seevakumaran, 30, and found a handgun, an assault rifle, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and four homemade bombs. Mr. Seevakumaran was also in the room, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The police said the would-be gunman had intended to force students into the hall with the fire alarm, where he would be waiting with his weapons. \n \n \u201cWhat was once the unthinkable has become the inevitable,\u201d Mr. Beary said. \u201cThese bad guys have plans and are heavily armed, and law enforcement needs to be able to keep up with them. In order to do that, police officers need to be highly trained, well equipped, and ready to respond to any scenario.\u201d \n \n Michael Qualls, an associate professor of criminal justice at Fort Valley State University, in Georgia, agrees. A retired Army officer, Mr. Qualls worked for several campus police departments before he began teaching. \u201cIf we continue on with the 1033 program, as those items become obsolete at the military level and if they become available, why not get \u2019em?\u201d Mr. Qualls said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be prepared than not prepared.\u201d \n \n But seeing that much firepower on college campuses is worrisome to some observers like Peter Kraska, a professor at Eastern Kentucky University\u2019s School of Justice Studies. Mr. Kraska has studied police militarization since the late 1980s. \n \n \u201cThe typical college-campus chief of police might say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve had serious incidents occur around the country on college campuses,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Kraska. \u201cThe flaw in that thinking is that they are not going to be able to respond, even if they have all of that stuff. Those incidents are usually over very, very quickly\u201d\u201425 minutes, tops. Longer than that, Mr. Kraska said, and the campus police will be joined by local and state law-enforcement officials, who will have greater capability and firepower. \n \n For Mary Anne Franks, an associate professor of law at the University of Miami, the possibility that an extraordinary event could occur doesn\u2019t justify the procurement of assault rifles and armored vehicles. The real danger Ferguson residents faced came not from a terrorist attack, she said, but from police officers armed with this sort of equipment. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \u201cMostly, I\u2019m wondering why,\u201d she said. \u201cAs much as one might wonder about why major cities are getting this type of equipment\u2014which I think we should wonder about and ask questions about\u2014it seems even stranger to talk about it happening in voluntary communities that don\u2019t experience much violent crime.\u201d \n \n Ms. Franks raised another concern: As students become aware of the military gear some police departments possess, she said, that may curtail their willingness to express themselves and protest. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not just the question of what happens in any one particular incident, but the tone it sets about what an environment needs to be,\u201d Ms. Franks said. \u201cThis presumption of danger\u2014this presumption of hostility\u2014is really toxic in many ways and avoids the problems that the community might actually be suffering from.\u201d \n \n 'A Profound Cultural Impact' \n \n To alleviate some of the apprehension surrounding the use of military weapons on a college campus, said Linda J. Stump, the University of Florida\u2019s police chief, transparency is key. The University of Florida police department acquired an armored truck in 2007 under the 1033 program. Ms. Stump said the vehicle would be deployed only during an active-shooter situation and never for a civil disturbance. \n \n Campus police officers are professionals, with processes in place to maintain their training levels, she said, and communities will be better served if departments explain that. \n \n Administrative oversight and communication are also necessary, said Mr. Perry of Florida State. Administrators outside the police department should be briefed not only on what type of equipment is being acquired but also on the circumstances under which such gear would be used. \n \n When the Florida State police department acquired a Humvee through the 1033 program, Mr. Perry said, he briefed administrators on the instances in which the vehicle would be used\u2014in active-shooter scenarios, for example, but also during a hurricane or at events for community outreach. \n \n When Ms. Stump talks about the value of transparency, she\u2019s also tackling the issue of training: Are college police officers experienced enough to handle assault rifles and other military gear? \n \n Yes, as long as they\u2019ve had the training required for departmental accreditation, said Mr. Perry. \n \n To earn accreditation from the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, for example, an organization must show proof that officers have attended training to use any new weapon, vehicle, or tool they acquire, Mr. Perry said. Training must be proctored by third-party instructors who know how to use the gear proficiently. Neither the Department of Defense nor the association administers the training. The Department of Defense does not require any training to obtain or keep the gear. \n \n \u201cAt a nonaccredited school, there is not an expectation for formalized policies and procedures,\u201d Mr. Perry said. The association\u2019s website lists 40 accredited college departments. Another group, the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, has accredited 70 college police departments, according to its website. \n \n The University of Virginia\u2019s police department purchased 12 M-16 rifles through the 1033 program, and the university converted them to patrol rifles\u2014guns that cannot be fired automatically. Officers who are issued patrol rifles receive three levels of training, said Mike Coleman, a captain in the department. Training sessions cover marksmanship, safety, decision making, and threat identification. The police department at the University of Virginia is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, as is the University of Florida. \n \n \u201cThe public is not aware of much of the training that university police officers receive,\u201d Mr. Coleman said. \u201cOur department not only attends the same police academy that municipal officers attend; they teach at that academy.\u201d \n \n Professors like Mr. Kraska remain concerned about how the 1033 program could affect campuses. \n \n \u201cIt can have a profound cultural impact on a small police department when you start adding weaponry, battle-dress uniforms, all the advanced military technologies,\u201d he said. \u201cThat small agency can go rapidly from one of protecting and serving to one of viewing the community as the enemy, and a potential threat.\u201d \n \n Lance Lambert and Max Lewontin contributed to this article. ||||| Should the campus police at the University of Central Florida ever need a grenade launcher, one sits waiting in the department\u2019s armory. Repurposed to fire tear-gas canisters, the weapon was used several years ago for training exercises, according to Richard Beary, the university\u2019s chief of police. It hasn\u2019t left storage since. \n \n At Central Florida, which has an enrollment of nearly 60,000 and a Division I football team, the device was acquired, a police spokeswoman said, for \u201csecurity and crowd control.\u201d But the university\u2019s police force isn\u2019t the only one to have come upon a grenade launcher. Hinds Community College\u2014located in western Mississippi, with a student population of 11,000\u2014had one too. (Campus police officers at Hinds declined to comment. A woman who worked for the department but declined to identify herself said that the launcher had been repurposed to shoot flares but that the college no longer possessed it.) \n \n Both institutions received their launchers from the same source: the Department of Defense. At least 117 colleges have acquired equipment from the department through a federal program, known as the 1033 program, that transfers military surplus to law-enforcement agencies across the country, according to records The Chronicle received after filing Freedom of Information requests with state governments (see table of equipment). \n \n Campus police departments have used the program to obtain military equipment as mundane as men\u2019s trousers (Yale University) and as serious as a mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicle (Ohio State University). Along with the grenade launcher, Central Florida acquired 23 M-16 assault rifles from the Department of Defense. \n \n Ask participants in the program, and they\u2019ll say it provides departments, particularly those with limited budgets like campus police forces, with necessary gear at very little cost (colleges pay only for shipping). Responsible departments, advocates say, develop plans for specific instances in which the equipment will be used\u2014crowd-control situations, say, or active-shooter incidents like the Virginia Tech massacre. Outside of those cases, community members are unlikely to know that the gear even exists. \n \n But on campus and off, there are detractors. Some argue that the procurement of tactical gear doesn\u2019t help with the types of crimes that occur more frequently on college campuses, like alcohol-related incidents and sexual assault. Others worry that military equipment is an especially poor fit for college campuses, fearing that it may have a chilling effect on free expression. \n \n The 1033 program has received heightened scrutiny in the wake of protests in Ferguson, Mo. After the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, reporters and phone-wielding protesters captured images of police officers armed with military-grade guns, camouflage, and armored vehicles. Observers characterized the police response as heavy-handed and criticized officers for improperly using their weaponry. \n \n In Washington renewed attention to the transfer of military weapons has led some lawmakers to call for a review of the 1033 program. Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri who heads the oversight subcommittee for the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, led a hearing on Tuesday to consider revisions in the program. She suggested that local police departments that enjoy cost savings from free military equipment be required to receive 200 hours of training. \n \n \u201cIf we\u2019re gonna give you money, we\u2019re going to make you jump through a few hoops first,\u201d she said. \n \n Hilary O. Shelton, director of the NAACP\u2019s Washington bureau, told the committee that if the 1033 program is to be continued, it should be restructured to focus on \u201cprotecting and serving citizens.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat from Michigan and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has said he plans to review the 1033 program before the Senate considers reauthorizing the annual military-spending bill. President Obama has also called for a review. \n \n Ms. McCaskill, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Obama joined Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky, and Rep. Hank Johnson, a Democrat from Georgia, in questioning the program. In an announcement that he would formally draft a bill in September imposing limits on the transfer of certain equipment\u2014including armored vehicles and large-caliber weapons\u2014Mr. Johnson mocked Ohio State\u2019s procurement of its heavy-duty vehicle, known as an MRAP, through the 1033 program. \n \n \"Apparently, college kids are getting too rowdy,\" Mr. Johnson said. \n \n Significant Savings \n \n The scrutiny may be increasing now, but the 1033 program has been available to colleges for quite some time. In 1990, Congress passed a version of the National Defense Authorization Act that allowed for the transfer of excess Department of Defense equipment to federal and state agencies if gear was deemed \u201csuitable for use by such agencies in counter-drug activities.\u201d In 1996 the law was reauthorized, with Section 1033 allowing for the transfer of equipment for terrorism-related purposes as well. \n \n Now more than 8,000 federal and state law-enforcement agencies\u2014many campus police departments among them\u2014are eligible to participate. Participating agencies don\u2019t buy equipment; they are given it. They are prohibited from reselling or leasing the gear, and required to provide updates on the location of \u201ctactical\u201d gear, like armored vehicles and weaponry. When a police department decides a piece of equipment has outlived its usefulness, it is returned to the government. \n \n After the buildup and winding down of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, the amount of surplus equipment available to law-enforcement agencies increased drastically. At colleges, where terrorist attacks and shootouts with drug cartels are virtually unheard of, the active-shooter scenario became the primary justification for colleges to acquire tactical gear. \n \n Central Florida got eight of its M-16 assault rifles in 2011, and 15 more were transferred to the department in February of the following year. At campus police departments, much like their counterparts at the local, state, and federal level, the most popular weapon procured through the 1033 program is the M-16 assault rifle. \n \n At least 60 institutions have acquired M-16s through the program. Arizona State University holds the most, with 70 in its arsenal, followed by Florida International University and the University of Maryland with 50 M-16s each. Central Florida received its grenade launcher in 2008; Hinds acquired its in 2006. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Gear through the 1033 program is free to participating departments, with receiving agencies having to pay only delivery and maintenance costs. The University of Louisiana at Monroe paid $507.43 for 12 M-16 rifles; the University of Alabama at Huntsville paid $220.40 for the transfer and shipping of five M-16s. \n \n \u201cFor me, this is a cost savings for taxpayers,\u201d said Jen Day Shaw, associate vice president and dean of students at the University of Florida and chair of the Campus Safety Knowledge Community, a forum for members of Naspa: Student Affairs Administrators in Higher Education. When police departments \u201chave the ability to get equipment that will help them do their jobs at a greatly reduced price,\u201d Ms. Shaw said, \u201cit is a benefit for the whole campus.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt is a force multiplier for us,\u201d said David Perry, chief of police at Florida State University and president of the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators. \u201cTypically, we are not staffed at optimum levels. We are not given budgets comparable to some large cities and municipalities, so we need to find ways to make it reach.\u201d \n \n Indeed, many police departments use the 1033 program to acquire basic supplies along with tactical equipment. \u201cAside from body armor and weapons,\u201d Mr. Perry said, \u201cthere is furniture, hand sanitizers, bandages. There are all types of equipment, materials, and supplies we need to support our overall mission.\u201d \n \n 'Better to Be Prepared' \n \n At Central Florida, Chief Beary said, M-16 rifles are stored in vehicles for emergencies, like the one his officers responded to at midnight on March 18, 2013. Answering a call for a pulled fire alarm, officers eventually raided the dormitory room of James Seevakumaran, 30, and found a handgun, an assault rifle, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, and four homemade bombs. Mr. Seevakumaran was also in the room, dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The police said the would-be gunman had intended to force students into the hall with the fire alarm, where he would be waiting with his weapons. \n \n \u201cWhat was once the unthinkable has become the inevitable,\u201d Mr. Beary said. \u201cThese bad guys have plans and are heavily armed, and law enforcement needs to be able to keep up with them. In order to do that, police officers need to be highly trained, well equipped, and ready to respond to any scenario.\u201d \n \n Michael Qualls, an associate professor of criminal justice at Fort Valley State University, in Georgia, agrees. A retired Army officer, Mr. Qualls worked for several campus police departments before he began teaching. \u201cIf we continue on with the 1033 program, as those items become obsolete at the military level and if they become available, why not get \u2019em?\u201d Mr. Qualls said. \u201cIt\u2019s better to be prepared than not prepared.\u201d \n \n But seeing that much firepower on college campuses is worrisome to some observers like Peter Kraska, a professor at Eastern Kentucky University\u2019s School of Justice Studies. Mr. Kraska has studied police militarization since the late 1980s. \n \n \u201cThe typical college-campus chief of police might say, \u2018Look, we\u2019ve had serious incidents occur around the country on college campuses,\u2019\u201d said Mr. Kraska. \u201cThe flaw in that thinking is that they are not going to be able to respond, even if they have all of that stuff. Those incidents are usually over very, very quickly\u201d\u201425 minutes, tops. Longer than that, Mr. Kraska said, and the campus police will be joined by local and state law-enforcement officials, who will have greater capability and firepower. \n \n For Mary Anne Franks, an associate professor of law at the University of Miami, the possibility that an extraordinary event could occur doesn\u2019t justify the procurement of assault rifles and armored vehicles. The real danger Ferguson residents faced came not from a terrorist attack, she said, but from police officers armed with this sort of equipment. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \u201cMostly, I\u2019m wondering why,\u201d she said. \u201cAs much as one might wonder about why major cities are getting this type of equipment\u2014which I think we should wonder about and ask questions about\u2014it seems even stranger to talk about it happening in voluntary communities that don\u2019t experience much violent crime.\u201d \n \n Ms. Franks raised another concern: As students become aware of the military gear some police departments possess, she said, that may curtail their willingness to express themselves and protest. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not just the question of what happens in any one particular incident, but the tone it sets about what an environment needs to be,\u201d Ms. Franks said. \u201cThis presumption of danger\u2014this presumption of hostility\u2014is really toxic in many ways and avoids the problems that the community might actually be suffering from.\u201d \n \n 'A Profound Cultural Impact' \n \n To alleviate some of the apprehension surrounding the use of military weapons on a college campus, said Linda J. Stump, the University of Florida\u2019s police chief, transparency is key. The University of Florida police department acquired an armored truck in 2007 under the 1033 program. Ms. Stump said the vehicle would be deployed only during an active-shooter situation and never for a civil disturbance. \n \n Campus police officers are professionals, with processes in place to maintain their training levels, she said, and communities will be better served if departments explain that. \n \n Administrative oversight and communication are also necessary, said Mr. Perry of Florida State. Administrators outside the police department should be briefed not only on what type of equipment is being acquired but also on the circumstances under which such gear would be used. \n \n When the Florida State police department acquired a Humvee through the 1033 program, Mr. Perry said, he briefed administrators on the instances in which the vehicle would be used\u2014in active-shooter scenarios, for example, but also during a hurricane or at events for community outreach. \n \n When Ms. Stump talks about the value of transparency, she\u2019s also tackling the issue of training: Are college police officers experienced enough to handle assault rifles and other military gear? \n \n Yes, as long as they\u2019ve had the training required for departmental accreditation, said Mr. Perry. \n \n To earn accreditation from the International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators, for example, an organization must show proof that officers have attended training to use any new weapon, vehicle, or tool they acquire, Mr. Perry said.

    "document": "Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images \n \n An interesting thing happened in my neighborhood recently. A small posse of local busybodies organized as the Shaw Dupont Citizens Alliance proposed a moratorium on new liquor licenses for the increasingly vibrant nightlife corridors on 14th Street and U Street in Washington, D.C. Similar moratoria already constrain longer-established D.C. drinking hubs, and when I heard about the Shaw Dupont proposal, initially I felt despondent. But, in fact, the NIMBYs look set to lose. A guy named Michael Hamilton founded a counter-group called In My Backyard\u2014D.C. to argue for growth-friendly policies. At a neighborhood listening session, moratorium proponents were vastly outnumbered. For now it looks as if Logan Circle and U Street will continue to be safe for entrepreneurs who want to turn vacant storefronts and derelict structures into bars and restaurants. \n \n Similar fights play out in cities all around the country but not always with the same happy outcome. Almost invariably, these fights give the extreme deference to the concerns of immediate neighbors. But this deference has a cost for everyone else. Cities need to recognize that bars and restaurants are not the ugly stepchildren of the modern urban economy: They are its greatest strength. They spur small-business growth and creation citywide. When cities consider whether to allow them, they should think about the overall benefits to the region, not the particular complaints of near neighbors. \n \n My neighborhood is hardly the only nightlife cluster in urban America featuring a version of this controversy. Last fall a group of residents of the Lower East Side in New York\u2014some oddly appropriating the \u201cOccupy\u201d brand\u2014tried to bring a halt to the issuance of new liquor licenses. Chicago has areas that have voted to become completely \u201cdry\u201d and moratorium zones where existing businesses stay open but no new liquor licenses can be issued. In California, many whole counties\u2014including all of San Francisco\u2014have gone into moratorium status. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Proponents of curtailing licenses typically cite local nuisance effects as the key reason. One of the Lower East Side anti-booze crusaders was quoted as worrying about a \u201cWild West atmosphere.\u201d In Washington, agitators cite the nightmare of becoming \u201cthe next Adams-Morgan\u201d\u2014while the actual Adams-Morgan is itself one of the areas operating under a moratorium. \n \n These complaints ought to be understood in the larger context of urban economics. Moratorium boosters often seem to think there\u2019s something unnatural about the heavy concentration of booze-serving establishments in a single area. They also think restricting bars and restaurants will cause the kind of thriving local retail they remember from old Jane Jacobs books to magically appear. \n \n In reality, there\u2019s nothing particularly unusual about similar firms clustering together. Auto companies were all near Detroit for a long time; high-tech firms huddle in the Bay Area; And nightlife hubs arise for similar reasons. Drinking and dining establishments want to be where people are likely to look for them. And people want to go to places where they\u2019ll find options. Complicated interdependencies and complementarities can arise. The late-night pizza joint\u2019s proximity to the dive bar increases the value of both. Alternatively, you might want to meet friends for dinner in a neighborhood where you\u2019re also likely to be able to grab a drink afterwards. Theaters and live-music venues benefit from proximity to other after-hours activities and also drive customers to bars and restaurants. Forcing the cluster to disperse destroys its value. Preventing new firms from entering the cluster fosters high prices and mediocrity, as underperforming bars and restaurants can essentially free-ride on the rest of the cluster. \n \n Providing these kinds of dense networks of related but independent small undertakings is exactly what cities are good at. \n \n What they\u2019re not so good at is playing host to modern retailers. Traditional urban neighborhoods feature old buildings with small, often irregularly shaped spaces that are ill-suited to the needs of contemporary retail chains. Refusing to grant liquor licenses won't undo the decades of history that brought us big-box stores.* It just leads to empty storefronts and car rides out to Ikea or Costco. The good news for cities is that lately Amazon has been crushing the big-box sector, and e-commerce levels the shopping playing field between traditional urban neighborhoods and suburban ones. And those smallish and idiosyncratic structures are ideal spaces for bars and restaurants\u2014much better than personality-free malls. Even better is that the Internet isn\u2019t going to put restaurants out of business, for obvious reasons. \n \n Under the circumstances, promoting the development and expansion of nightlife hubs should be a key economic development priority for cities. Or, rather, preventing neighborhood busybodies from stifling them ought to be. That means making decisions about liquor-licensing rules at a higher level, with consideration of the full citywide effects in terms of tax revenue and job creation. And it means attempting to directly address perceived problems with crime and trash. Instead of refusing to issue new liquor licenses, why not send more cops and offer more frequent street cleaning in the hubs? Food service isn\u2019t the sexiest sector in the economy. But it\u2019s one that every city can be strong in. It also provides great opportunities for locally owned businesses, and meaningful opportunities for people with limited formal education to work their way up the ladder and go into business for themselves. Cities need to treat it as a more serious matter than a simple question of neighborhood opinion. ||||| Drinking too much can harm your health. Excessive alcohol use led to approximately 88,000 deaths and 2.5 million years of potential life lost (YPLL) each year in the United States from 2006 \u2013 2010, shortening the lives of those who died by an average of 30 years.1,2 Further, excessive drinking was responsible for 1 in 10 deaths among working-age adults aged 20-64 years. The economic costs of excessive alcohol consumption in 2010 were estimated at $249 billion, or $2.05 a drink.3 Download a PDF of this factsheet in English Cdc-pdf [PDF \u2013 0.9MB] or in Spanish Cdc-pdf [PDF \u2013 1.1MB] \n \n What is a \u201cdrink\u201d? \n \n In the United States, a standard drink contains 0.6 ounces (14.0 grams or 1.2 tablespoons) of pure alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in \n \n 12-ounces of beer (5% alcohol content). \n \n 8-ounces of malt liquor (7% alcohol content). \n \n 5-ounces of wine (12% alcohol content). \n \n 1.5-ounces of 80-proof (40% alcohol content) distilled spirits or liquor (e.g., gin, rum, vodka, whiskey).4 \n \n What is excessive drinking? \n \n Excessive drinking includes binge drinking, heavy drinking, and any drinking by pregnant women or people younger than age 21. \n \n Binge drinking, the most common form of excessive drinking, is defined as consuming For women, 4 or more drinks during a single occasion. For men, 5 or more drinks during a single occasion. \n \n Heavy drinking is defined as consuming For women, 8 or more drinks per week. For men, 15 or more drinks per week. \n \n \n \n Most people who drink excessively are not alcoholics or alcohol dependent.5 \n \n What is moderate drinking? \n \n The Dietary Guidelines for Americans defines moderate drinking as up to 1 drink per day for women and up to 2 drinks per day for men.4 In addition, the Dietary Guidelines do not recommend that individuals who do not drink alcohol start drinking for any reason. \n \n However, there are some people who should not drink any alcohol, including those who are: \n \n Younger than age 21. \n \n Pregnant or may be pregnant. \n \n Driving, planning to drive, or participating in other activities requiring skill, coordination, and alertness. \n \n Taking certain prescription or over-the-counter medications that can interact with alcohol. \n \n Suffering from certain medical conditions. \n \n Recovering from alcoholism or are unable to control the amount they drink. \n \n By adhering to the Dietary Guidelines, you can reduce the risk of harm to yourself or others. \n \n Short-Term Health Risks \n \n Excessive alcohol use has immediate effects that increase the risk of many harmful health conditions. These are most often the result of binge drinking and include the following: \n \n Injuries, such as motor vehicle crashes, falls, drownings, and burns. 6,7 \n \n Violence, including homicide, suicide, sexual assault, and intimate partner violence. 6-10 \n \n Alcohol poisoning, a medical emergency that results from high blood alcohol levels. 11 \n \n Risky sexual behaviors, including unprotected sex or sex with multiple partners. These behaviors can result in unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. 12,13 \n \n Miscarriage and stillbirth or fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) among pregnant women.6,12,14,15 \n \n Long-Term Health Risks \n \n Over time, excessive alcohol use can lead to the development of chronic diseases and other serious problems including: \n \n High blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, liver disease, and digestive problems. 6,16 \n \n Cancer of the breast, mouth, throat, esophagus, liver, and colon. 6,17 \n \n Learning and memory problems, including dementia and poor school performance. 6,18 \n \n Mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. 6,19 \n \n Social problems, including lost productivity, family problems, and unemployment. 6,20,21 \n \n Alcohol dependence, or alcoholism.5 \n \n By not drinking too much, you can reduce the risk of these short- and long-term health risks. \n \n References ||||| AIMS: \n \n Substituting cannabis for alcohol may reduce drinking and related problems among alcohol-dependent individuals. Some even recommend prescribing medical cannabis to individuals attempting to reduce drinking. The primary aim of this review is to assess whether cannabis satisfies the seven previously published criteria for substitute medications for alcohol [e.g. 'reduces alcohol-related harms'; 'is safer in overdose than alcohol'; 'should offer significant health economic benefits'; see Chick and Nutt ((2012) Substitution therapy for alcoholism: time for a reappraisal? J Psychopharmacol 26:205-12)]. \n \n METHODS: \n \n Literature review. \n \n RESULTS: \n \n All criteria appear either satisfied or partially satisfied, though studies relying on medical cannabis patients may be limited by selection bias and/or retrospective designs. Individual-level factors, such as severity of alcohol problems, may also moderate substitution. \n \n CONCLUSIONS: \n \n There is no clear pattern of outcomes related to cannabis substitution. Most importantly, the recommendation to prescribe alcohol-dependent individuals cannabis to help reduce drinking is premature. Future studies should use longitudinal data to better understand the consequences of cannabis substitution. ||||| Blogger-pundit Matt Yglesias really wants more bars. First at Think Progress, then at Slate and now at Vox, the commentator has waged a one-man rhetorical war on the country\u2019s urban liquor boards. The current licensing system, in which the number of bars is constrained by city bureaucrats rather than market demand, Yglesias has argued, leaves us with a paucity of public drinking spots where they\u2019re wanted. From New York\u2019s East Village to Adams Morgan in Washington, D.C., license limitations have caused bars to become rare, expensive, crowded and all around worse. \n \n There\u2019s just one problem with Yglesias\u2019 more-bars plan: alcohol. America has a serious issue with responsible drinking, and increasing the number of sales locations probably won\u2019t help. Alcohol abuse already kills tens of thousands of Americans annually and costs hundreds of billions of dollars a year in lost productivity, health care and property damage. It\u2019s an especially big problem for college students and other young people; Jake New reported for Insider Higher Education that at least eight college freshman died in the first few weeks of school this year, most in alcohol-related accidents or overdoses. \u201cOver the last 10 years, we\u2019ve seen a fairly dramatic increase of alcohol-related hospitalizations in this age group,\u201d George Koob, the director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism at the National Institutes of Health, told New. More bars would contribute to what\u2019s already a public health crisis. Studies in Los Angeles and Cleveland suggest adding a bar is associated with about three additional violent crimes a year. \n \n It\u2019s hard to imagine bars without alcohol. Caffeine is popular, but it\u2019s not what economists call a substitute good for booze. Luckily, those aren\u2019t our only options. In a post for Vox, German Lopez suggested that the strongest argument for marijuana legalization might be that people will use it instead of alcohol. Although prohibition has no doubt suppressed use, marijuana\u2019s social costs per user are negligible, especially compared with alcohol\u2019s. A recent National Institutes of Health study suggested that marijuana appears to fit the seven published criteria to be a substitute medication for alcohol, in the same way doctors prescribe methadone for heroin dependence. From a public health perspective, every drink we can replace with a toke is a victory. \n \n Individual states, moved by a combination of hard evidence and shifting public opinion, are advancing with plans to legalize recreational marijuana use. So far, only Colorado and Washington have gone all the way to legalization, but the whole country is headed quickly in that direction. Despite all the new regulatory architectures for growing, distributing and using marijuana without violating the law, no states have been willing to propose what responsible common use in public could look like. Not one Amsterdam-style coffee shop has managed to keep its doors open. Still, there\u2019s a demand for marijuana bars or weed cafes or whatever we end up calling them, a demand that\u2019s being suppressed far more strongly than the demand for more alcohol bars. ||||| BACKGROUND: \n \n Excessive alcohol consumption causes premature death (average of 79,000 deaths annually); increased disease and injury; property damage from fire and motor vehicle crashes; alcohol-related crime; and lost productivity. However, its economic cost has not been assessed for the U.S. since 1998. \n \n PURPOSE: \n \n To update prior national estimates of the economic costs of excessive drinking. \n \n METHODS: \n \n This study (conducted 2009-2010) followed U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines to assess the economic cost of excessive alcohol consumption in 2006. Costs for health care, productivity losses, and other effects (e.g., property damage) in 2006 were obtained from national databases. Alcohol-attributable fractions were obtained from multiple sources and used to assess the proportion of costs that could be attributed to excessive alcohol consumption. \n \n RESULTS: \n \n The estimated economic cost of excessive drinking was $223.5 billion in 2006 (72.2% from lost productivity, 11.0% from healthcare costs, 9.4% from criminal justice costs, and 7.5% from other effects) or approximately $1.90 per alcoholic drink. Binge drinking resulted in costs of $170.7 billion (76.4% of the total); underage drinking $24.6 [corrected] billion; and drinking during pregnancy $5.2 billion. The cost of alcohol-attributable crime was $73.3 billion. The cost to government was $94.2 billion (42.1% of the total cost), which corresponds to about $0.80 per alcoholic drink consumed in 2006 (categories are not mutually exclusive and may overlap). \n \n CONCLUSIONS: \n \n On a per capita basis, the economic impact of excessive alcohol consumption in the U.S. is approximately $746 per person, most of which is attributable to binge drinking. Evidence-based strategies for reducing excessive drinking should be widely implemented. \n \n Copyright \u00a9 2011 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. All rights reserved.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Malcolm Harris doesn't have a problem with more bars\u2014he just thinks those bars should sell pot, not alcohol. In an opinion piece for Al-Jazeera America, Harris offers his take on how marijuana bars would give Americans more palatable gathering spaces with fewer health risks, creating an \"urban-planning win-win\" and possibly even saving lives. Some highlights: Harris points out the 88,000 deaths annually from excessive alcohol use as noted by the CDC and the \"hundreds of billions of dollars a year in lost productivity, health care, and property damage\" that the National Institutes of Health has researched. Citing another NIH study, Harris says that pot would serve as an acceptable \"substitute medication\" for booze: \"From a public health perspective, every drink we can replace with a toke is a victory.\" There are few places these days that resemble the famous bar from Cheers. \"Fewer and fewer people have a third place (not work or home) where everyone knows their name,\" Harris writes. Because so many people have migrated to the suburbs and holed up with their cable TV and Internet, not as many people are heading out to congregate. \"These spaces [would] promote community integration, friendship, and extrafamilial networks of support,\" Harris notes. Although he's optimistic that \"eventually Americans will have public places to go and get high with their friends,\" Harris thinks government should ease up on strict regulations. \"Not one Amsterdam-style coffee shop has managed to keep its doors open,\" he writes. \"Though owners seem willing to conform to whatever guidelines they're given, so far, no locality wants to be the first to host an American marijuana bar.\" Harris also acknowledges some of the logistical hurdles that businesses may have to overcome. \"One problem with weed bars is employees' right to a smoke-free workplace; even if cops allowed indoor marijuana smoking, no one would be allowed to work there,\" he writes.

(Published Thursday, Aug. 13, 2015) ||||| Family of Bart Palosz sues Greenwich, public schools for failing to protect him from bullying \n \n Almost two years after 15-year-old Bart Palosz committed suicide on the first day of his sophomore year at Greenwich High School, a lawsuit brought against the town sheds new light on the case and again raises the question of whether the school district should share the blame in the teenager\u2019s decision to take his life. \n \n The lawsuit, filed Wednesday by Bart\u2019s parents, Anna Izabela Palosz and Franciszek Palosz, claims school staff were well aware of bullying he endured at school for years, yet did not follow mandatory anti-bullying policies, a failure they claim contributed to their son\u2019s death. \n \n School documents that indicate what officials did know about Bart\u2019s history, undisclosed until now, have been revealed in filings in state Superior Court in Stamford. They include a record of Bart in the district\u2019s \u201csharings\u201d program, which details important information for Greenwich High staff about incoming ninth-graders. \n \n \u201cThe middle school sharings document is a smoking gun,\u201d said David Golub, the attorney representing the Paloszes. \u201cIt shows that the school system knew, but ignored\u201d the Board of Education\u2019s anti-bullying procedures. \n \n Bart is described in the sharings document as a \u201cvery socially awkward\u201d student who was bullied regularly during his years at Western Middle School but did not tell anyone about it. The teenager was \u201cannoying\u201d to his peers and would stare at them, but he wanted to be liked and needed to be connected, the document states. \n \n \u201cSocial work needed\u201d was written on the form. It was a recommendation that was never acted upon, according to the lawsuit. \n \n School records show that the bullying of Bart included name-calling and teasing, repeated incidents of property theft and hitting and kicking from classmates, according to the lawsuit. \n \n Bart was hit in the head with a locker \u2014 an injury that required stitches \u2014 and had his shoelaces tied together, according to the sharings document. \n \n \u201cI wanted to make you aware that Bart was pretty severely bullied in middle school,\u201d his guidance counselor wrote in a November 2012 email to Bart\u2019s classroom teachers when he was in ninth grade, another new revelation contained in the lawsuit. \u201cHe would not report any of the incidents to the school, so the only way it was brought to light was if it was observed or if he told at home.\u201d \n \n Superintendent of Schools William McKersie and Greenwich High Headmaster Chris Winters declined to comment on the lawsuit. They referred inquiries to Town Attorney John Wayne Fox, who was not available for comment Wednesday. \n \n First Selectman Peter Tesei did not return a message left for him by press time. Board of Education members either did not return messages or declined to comment. \n \n Lawyers for the Paloszes and the town tried for many months to negotiate a settlement, but they could not come to terms, according to Golub. The lawsuit had to be filed before a two-year statute of limitation from the date of Bart\u2019s death went into effect on Aug. 27. \n \n \u201cWe feel this lawsuit is important so that other students in Greenwich don\u2019t suffer the same kind of treatment that Bart did,\u201d the Palosz family said in a statement. \u201cIt is our hope that this lawsuit will result in changes to how the Greenwich school system responds to students in need of help so that there will be no more needless deaths.\u201d \n \n The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of damages in excess of $15,000, the threshold for filing in the court. The complaint marks the first legal action brought against the district and town related to Bart\u2019s death. \n \n School and municipal officials have until Sept. 8 to respond. \n \n History of bullying \n \n Reports of bullying became widespread in the immediate aftermath of Bart\u2019s death, a tragedy that shocked the Greenwich community. \n \n \u201cI knew it was a matter of time, but it's very painful to relive what happened to Bart,\u201d Lori Keegan, a friend of the Paloszes, said in an email Wednesday. \u201cBart was an easy target; he didn\u2019t fight back. He was quiet and shy. I think about him every day.\u201d \n \n Family and friends have said Bart was picked on for a number of reasons, including his socially awkward demeanor, his tall and heavy-set frame, his acne and his Polish accent. His family immigrated to the U.S. from Poland when he was four years old. \n \n Bart\u2019s troubles were known to Western administrators, including two assistant principals, according to the lawsuit. In a May 2012 meeting with then-Assistant Principal Albert Sackey, an eighth-grade Bart reportedly admitted to several instances of being physically and verbally abused. \n \n But Palosz\u2019s treatment by his peers apparently did not improve at Greenwich High, which Bart began attending in the fall of 2012. Less than two months into his freshman year, a classmate in a biology class smashed his new Android smartphone, according to the lawsuit. Shortly after Bart died, his sister, Beata, recalled the same incident. \n \n By the spring of his freshman year, Bart was showing major signs of his distress, the lawsuit said. His grades dropped off precipitously, he decided to stop turning in his homework and he was biting his hands in class. \n \n While he was reluctant to share his ordeals with others face-to-face, Bart did open up on the social network Google+. There, he posted plans to harm himself due to \"school caused insanity.\" \n \n \"I have chosen to go with 3 peoples (sic) advice and kill myself,\" he wrote in June 2013, adding that he had just swallowed pills. \"I just wish it was faster.\" \n \n He would survive that episode and show up for the first day of classes to start his sophomore year, on Aug. 27, 2013. It would be his first and only day at Greenwich High without Beata, who had graduated the previous June. She was a crucial source of company and protection from his antagonists. \n \n After school that day, Bart returned to an empty home. He grabbed the key to a gun safe in his bedroom where his father kept his hunting rifles. With one of those weapons, he ended his life by shooting himself in the head. \n \n Culpability \n \n The lawsuit charges that teachers, administrators and counselors were negligent because they failed in a number of ways to meet the district\u2019s anti-bullying policies and procedures. Their failure comprised a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in Bart\u2019s decision to take his own life, the complaint claims. \n \n They did not, according to the lawsuit, properly carry out the following required actions: \n \n Reporting and investigating bullying of Bart. \n \n Taking the steps prescribed on the middle school \u201csharings\u201d form. \n \n Notifying and meeting with Bart\u2019s parents and the parents of students who bullied Bart. \n \n Disciplining the students who bullied Bart. \n \n Developing student safety support and intervention plans in response to the bullying of Bart. \n \n \u201cHad defendants\u2019 personnel complied with the mandatory provisions of the policy, as required, Bart would have received counseling, including appropriate encouragement to advocate on his own behalf (which school personnel universally recognized Bart could not do,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cBart also would have been protected from his tormentors and would have been to feel less tormented.\u201d \n \n While school and municipal officials have acknowledged that Palosz was bullied, they have argued that educators cared about him and did their best to help him. \n \n \u201cWe knew Bart very well,\u201d McKersie said at Board of Selectmen meeting a couple of weeks after Bart died. \u201cI remember his dad, I remember his mom, I remember his sister... This is a case of a young man who took his life who we knew well.\u201d \n \n But school officials have declined to specify the support that Bart received. Citing privacy laws, they have opposed Freedom of Information requests for access to Bart\u2019s school records. \n \n The district launched an investigation immediately after Bart\u2019s death but handed it over less than two weeks later to the town\u2019s legal department. \n \n In April 2014, Fox, the town attorney, reported on the findings of a draft report, but the document has never been made public. \n \n \u201cIt is clear from our investigation that this young man was subjected to acts by students or groups of students directed against him with what I would define and describe as an intent to ridicule, humiliate or to intimidate him,\u201d Fox said at a Board of Education meeting. \n \n \u201cIt was also clear to me and to our findings that the school system was aware of those difficulties that Bart was having, was attentive to them and set up procedures and programs in an attempt to address them. There will always be a question and debate as to whether enough was done or if some things could have been done better.\u201d \n \n Other town officials took a more emphatic position. \n \n \u201cWe as a community failed this child,\u201d Selectman Drew Marzullo said in February 2014. \n \n \u201cWe tried very hard to resolve this matter with the town without the need for a lawsuit, but unfortunately were unable to do so,\u201d Golub said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that the town, while admitting that it \u2018failed this child,\u2019 won\u2019t actually take responsibility for what happened here.\u201d \n \n Golub said the town decided against settling, but he declined to specify the reason. \n \n pschott@scni.com; 203-625-4439; twitter: @paulschott",

Roughly 500 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean are at risk for Zika virus infection, so even modest increases in the incidence of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 are worrisome. \n \n The nations in the study included the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Suriname, Venezuela and Colombia, along with the state of Bahia in Brazil.

The condition can cause temporary paralysis and in rare instances, death. \n \n Rivera noted that it's unusual for the victim to be so young. \n \n \"What does this tell us? That all of us are susceptible,\" Rivera said as she urged Puerto Ricans to protect themselves from the mosquito-borne virus. \n \n The man, who died last month, was obese but did not have any other health conditions, she said. No further details about the victim were provided. \n \n The U.S. territory has a total of 13,186 confirmed Zika cases, with a total of 102 hospitalizations and 34 cases of Guillain-Barre. The number of Zika cases is believed to be much higher because eight of 10 people have no symptoms and many do not go to the doctor. Those infected include 1,106 pregnant women, which is a concern because Zika has been linked to severe birth defects. \n \n \"We are not going to see the effects of Zika today,\" Rivera said. \"We are going to see them in the next couple of months, in the next several years.\" \n \n Puerto Rico reported the first Zika-related microcephaly case acquired on U.S. soil in May, involving a dead fetus that a woman turned over to health authorities. Since then no microcephaly cases have been reported, but federal officials say it is only a matter of time. A study published Friday in JAMA Pediatrics estimates that up to 10,300 pregnant women in Puerto Rico could be infected with Zika and that between 100 to 270 babies could be born with microcephaly through mid-2017. \n \n In addition, some babies infected with Zika may present other type of problems such as eye abnormalities, hearing loss and inflexible joints, said Dr. Peggy Honein, chief of the birth defects branch at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n \n \"We are very concerned about these often devastating outcomes,\" she said in a phone interview. \n \n Honein, who was involved in the study, said that one of the major challenges of the Zika outbreak is the time delay in babies being born with severe defects. \n \n \"It doesn't mean that it's not happening because we don't see the effects yet,\" she warned. \n \n The U.S. government last week declared a public health emergency in Puerto Rico because of Zika, and federal officials have warned that up to 25 percent of Puerto Rico's nearly 3.5 million people could become infected. \n \n The CDC recently urged Puerto Rico fight Zika with the insecticide naled through aerial spraying, but the governor rejected that proposal and instead authorized the use of Bti, an organic larvicide. ||||| Our apologies.

At the very least, rates doubled, the officials said in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. \n \n A specialist at Harris County Public Health and Environmental Services holds a box that contains captured mosquitoes. Jennifer Weiss / NBC News \n \n \u201cDuring the weeks of Zika virus transmission, there were significant increases in the incidence of the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, as compared with the pre-Zika virus baseline incidence, in (Brazil\u2019s) Bahia State (an increase of 172 percent), Colombia (211 percent), the Dominican Republic (150 percent), El Salvador (100 percent), Honduras (144 percent), Suriname (400 percent), and Venezuela (877 percent),\u201d they wrote. \u201cWhen the incidence of Zika virus disease increased, so did the incidence of the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\u201d \n \n Doctors are fairly certain that Zika can cause Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a little understood reaction in which the immune system attacks the nerves. It can cause temporary but often severe paralysis. In extreme cases, patients must be put on ventilators to help them breathe until they recover. \n \n Related: Rare Zika Complication Hits 30 in Puerto Rico \n \n It can be fatal \u2014 Guillain-Barr\u00e9 caused by Zika killed a man in Puerto Rico last month. It's usually seen in about every 5,000 to 10,000 infections like Zika. Other infections also can cause Guillain-Barr\u00e9. \n \n \u201cWhen the incidence of Zika virus disease increased, so did the incidence of the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\u201d \n \n Zika\u2019s worst effect is the brain and nerve damage it causes in developing fetuses. It can devastate the growing brain and there is no way to prevent or reverse the effects. \n \n Pregnant women in Zika-affected zones are warned to avoid mosquito bites if they possibly can by using repellents, covering up with clothing and staying inside behind screens and air conditioning. But these facilities are often not available in some of the worst-hit places. \n \n The researchers found more women than men reported Zika infections, but said that might be because women are more aware of the risks because of the pregnancy link. However, men were more likely to develop Guillain-Barr\u00e9. \n \n \u201cFrom April 1, 2015, to March 31, 2016, a total of 164,237 confirmed and suspected cases of Zika virus disease and 1,474 cases of the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome were reported in Bahia, Brazil; Colombia; the Dominican Republic; El Salvador; Honduras; Suriname; and Venezuela,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe reported incidence of the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome was 28 percent higher among males than among females and consistently increased with age, findings that are in line with previous reports.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe reported incidence of the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome was 28 percent higher among males than among females.\u201d \n \n Zika has often circulated quietly, in part because it doesn\u2019t cause symptoms in most people and in part because it looks like so many other mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue virus. \n \n The health officials suggested that watching for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 cases might be one way to spot Zika outbreaks. \n \n Related: Zika Link to Birth Defects, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 'Alarming' \n \n \u201cApproximately 500 million people in Latin America and the Caribbean are at risk for Zika virus infection,\u201d they wrote. \n \n \u201cIt is clear that increases in the incidence of the Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome to a level that is 2 and 9.8 times as high as baseline, as we have reported here, impose a substantial burden on populations and health services in this region.\u201d ||||| Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon sickness of the nervous system in which a person\u2019s own immune system damages the nerve cells, causing muscle weakness, and sometimes, paralysis. Several countries that have experienced Zika outbreaks recently have reported increases in people who have Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). \n \n Current CDC research suggests that GBS is strongly associated with Zika; however, only a small proportion of people with recent Zika virus infection get GBS. CDC is continuing to investigate the link between GBS and Zika to learn more. \n \n Symptoms of GBS \n \n GBS symptoms include weakness of the arms and legs and, in severe cases, can affect the muscles that control breathing. \n \n These symptoms can last a few weeks or several months. Most people fully recover from GBS, though some people have permanent damage. Very few people die from GBS. \n \n Causes of GBS \n \n Researchers do not fully understand what causes GBS. Most people with GBS report an infection before they have GBS symptoms. Rarely, vaccination has also been associated with the onset of GBS (for example, the 1976 Swine influenza vaccine). \n \n GBS is rare \n \n An estimated 3,000 to 6,000 people, or 1-2 cases for every 100,000 people, develop GBS each year in the US. Most cases of GBS tend to occur for no known reason, and true \u201cclusters\u201d of cases of GBS are very unusual. \n \n What to do if you are concerned \n \n If you want to know more about the number of GBS cases in a certain area, contact the state or local health department in the state where the cases happen. CDC collaborates with state and local health departments to investigate reports of possibly unusually large numbers or \u201cclusters\u201d of GBS cases. \n \n Additional Resources \n \n Vaccine Safety Concerns- Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome \n \n Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and Flu Vaccine: Questions and Answers",

Rescuer J.R. Atkins, a former firefighter and medic, was contaminated through an insect bite on his arm while helping Missouri City neighbors. He survived. \n \n Now Playing: \n \n \"It's tragic,\" said Dr. David Persse, director of the city's emergency medical services. \"This is one of the things we'd been worrying about once the flooding began, that something like this might occur. My heart goes out to the family.\" \n \n According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, necrotizing fasciitis is a serious bacterial skin infection that kills the body's soft tissue, spreads quickly and can be fatal in a short time. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics can prevent death. \n \n The infection is not considered a reportable disease in Texas, meaning doctors or laboratories who diagnose it are not required to alert health authorities. But they are required to report many of the organisms that cause the disease \u2014 streptococcus, E. coli, vibrio vulnificus and certain types of drug-resistant staphylococcus. \n \n Strep is the most common cause of flesh-eating bacteria. Vibrio is the most common in salt water. \n \n Since 2010, the CDC has documented 700 to 1,100 cases of necrotizing fasciitis annually caused by group A strep, but details were not immediately available how many deaths were caused by the infection. \n \n Reed fell at her son's home in Kingwood, breaking and cutting her arm, according to a family friend. After the injury became infected, she was treated at Memorial Hermann Hospital - The Woodlands and then taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital - Texas Medical Center, where she died. \n \n The Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences concluded that the infection complicated the blunt trauma to her arm. Reed is the county's 36th death to be officially linked to Hurricane Harvey and its aftermath, which contributed to more than 75 deaths statewide. \n \n Reed was remembered during a memorial service on Friday at First Presbyterian Church of Kingwood. \n \n According to her obituary, Reed was a community volunteer and chief executive of the LivingTributes.com website of online memorials to the deceased. She was widowed with one son, John Reed. \n \n Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Jan. 4, 1940, she was a former elementary school teacher and worked at The Reed Agency with her husband, Gary, until he died in 1999. She was also president of the Reed Foundation. \n \n \"Nancy was a kind, caring member of the Kingwood community and gave of her time and many talents generously,\" her obituary said. \n \n She was active in her church, serving on multiple committees, and worked with the Village Learning and Achievement Center and the Upbring Krause Children's Center. \n \n Her relatives could not be reached for comment. ||||| EMBED More News Videos J.R. Atkins tells reporter Kevin Quinn about his battle with a rare bout of flesh-eating bacteria after Harvey. \n \n EMBED More News Videos Doctors in Houston are working on a vaccine they hope will fight off flesh-eating bacteria. \n \n A Missouri City man says he contracted flesh-eating bacteria right in his own neighborhood as he was trying to help his neighbors during Hurricane Harvey.With flood waters still rising and a mandatory evacuation in effect, J.R. Atkins hopped into a kayak to check on elderly neighbors who were staying behind during the emergency.\"A day or two before, it was going to be at critical mass,\" Atkins said.Only later did he realize his arm was swelling up.\"That's not good,\" he said.What started as a mosquito bite on his arm during the flood landed him in the ER before a stay in intensive care.When he got there, he was quickly diagnosed with flesh-eating bacteria, and it was advancing so rapidly his heart rate was quickly dropping to critical levels.\"That was when I got concerned,\" Atkins said.Doctors stabilized Atkins and put him on at least four antibiotics, but he had to endure three surgeries to relieve pressure in his arm and debride the wound.Atkins, a former paramedic, has medical knowledge which led to both calm and concern.\"Once I got past the 'imminent death,' that wasn't...it wasn't as scary after that,\" he said.Harris County Public Health officials said this sort of infection is rare, typically only seen in those with compromised immune systems. But they have seen an uptick since the flood in people with skin gastro-intestinal and respiratory infections.Just because the water is gone doesn't mean the threat is completely, says Dr. Umair Shah.\"I think that's the big misnomer,\" Dr. Shah said. \"People think, 'Oh, I don't have water anymore, I'm not at risk.\"The bacteria can still be present on anything the floodwaters touched, Shah said.Meantime, researchers with the Houston Methodist Research Institute are studying group A strep infections that can lead to this flesh-eating disease.They've identified a critical target which they hope can help reduce the severity of infections or clear them up more quickly.That development could save countless lives and decrease the amount of suffering for so many who otherwise must deal with this silent disease.One thing public health officials said should be clear: You should throw out anything that can't be disinfected. It's not worth the risk of infection, which apparently can still occur even though the waters are gone.By the way, Atkins says if there is another flood, he would go back out and try to help his neighbors again, even though he knows he could put himself at risk.",

    "document": "When visiting a new city for the first time, it\u2019s customary to purchase a souvenir that not only represents the culture but also marks your adventure away from home. Typically, a miniature Empire State Building after a jaunt to New York or a pashmina shawl found at a souk in Dubai will do, but one entrepreneur from Paris takes the concept of procuring a piece of the land quite literally, selling a range of hand-painted cobblestones that come directly from Paris\u2019s storied streets. \n \n Last summer Margaux Sainte-Lag\u00fce noticed a line of jackhammers tearing up the cobblestones on Paris\u2019s tony Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es as she rode her Vespa down the street. Sainte-Lag\u00fce, who has a collection of eccentric decorative objects throughout her home, thought a small cut of cobblestone would make for a perfect addition to her library\u2019s bookshelf. \u201cI only wanted one for myself but ended up buying five tons,\u201d Sainte-Lag\u00fce says. \n \n In early 2016 the city of Paris began selling thousands of tons of cobblestones from its most iconic roads and secret-trodden alleyways as part of its circular economy, with goals of reducing waste and saving energy, which resulted in the attraction of buyers like Sainte-Lag\u00fce. With several tons of chiseled cobblestones in her possession, Sainte-Lag\u00fce launched her online store, Mon Pav\u00e9 Parisien , offering three styles of the five-pound stones: a classic version hand-painted in the colors of France\u2019s flag, one gilded in 22.5 carats of gold, and the May 68 series stone, whose bottom half is sheathed in sand and features the inscription \u201csous les pav\u00e9s,\u201d a popular phrase used during the protests of the May 1968 revolution. \n \n If Sainte-Lag\u00fce\u2019s signature stone variations don\u2019t suit your home\u2019s decor, she will customize the design to your liking.

French entrepreneur Margaux Sainte-Lague has something for you. \n \n Earlier this year, when Paris began selling thousands of tons of cobblestones that once paved the city\u2019s streets and alleys, Sainte-Lague bought five tons. She is now reselling them to tourists and collectors keen to own a well-trodden piece of the French capital\u2019s history. \n \n A cobblestone from Mon Pave Parisien Source: Mon Pave Parisien \n \n Her company, Mon Pave Parisien, is an illustration of how used materials like stones, glass and concrete are being put on the market for construction projects or, in this case, as souvenirs for lovers of Paris and visitors to the city of light. The activity is rooted in a movement to create a so-called circular economy that\u2019s being promoted by the French government, European Commission and some builders to reduce waste and save energy through recycling and reuse. \n \n \u201cThe Parisian cobblestones have attracted the interest of many people, including tourists,\u201d said Patrick Marchetti, who runs the Paris city maintenance center where the cobblestones are sorted and cleaned. \u201cThey are cheap and have some charm.\u201d \n \n While Sainte-Lague\u2019s sales are relatively low so far -- she has sold 50 of the chiseled stones -- customers are steady and come from far-flung places. They have ranged from Chinese brides to a U.S.-based French expatriate nostalgic about her youth during the protests of May 1968, when cobblestones were hurled at the police by demonstrators during national strikes. Sainte-Lague now plans to sell her wares in luxury boutiques and souvenir shops near the city\u2019s monuments. \n \n \u201cFirst in concept stores, and then, why not, in souvenir boutiques,\u201d she said. \n \n Champs-Elysees \n \n On a larger scale, French builder Eiffage SA has said it will recycle materials from public works into cement aggregate. Cie de Saint-Gobain, Europe\u2019s biggest supplier of construction materials, is working with recycling company Paprec Group to collect discarded residential windows for use in new products. \n \n The French capital may sell as many as 3 million tons of the cube-shaped granite, Marchetti estimates. The cobblestones, first laid in Paris in the 11th century, were retrieved from several layers below pavements ripped up during civil works projects, including a new tramway. The city put the blocks on the market in March. \n \n Paris is by no means getting rid of all its its cobblestones. The ones around the famous Arc de Triomphe and Place de la Concorde will remain, while those along the Champs-Elysees are being polished and refurbished into smoother, more regular shapes for cars, bikes, strollers and high heels, Marchetti said. \n \n Picasso\u2019s Path \n \n Most of the cobblestones sold directly by the city from a warehouse in a southern suburb of Paris have gone to small companies recycling them to pave terraces and driveways, he said. The city\u2019s customers have included the foundation created by French photographer and environmentalist Yann Arthus-Bertrand for the renovation of the Longchamp castle, in front of the famous horse-racing course. \n \n At a retail price of eight euros a square meter (11 square feet), or 40 euros a ton, the sales could add about 400,000 euros ($371,000) annually to municipal coffers if 10,000 tons are extracted from under asphalt every year. At that rate, the supply is estimated to last for about three centuries. \n \n At between 60 euros and 150 euros a cobblestone, shipping within France included, Sainte-Lague is making a tidy profit from her central Parisian workshop where she cleans and custom decorates each stone -- some elaborately with gold leaves. With the possibility that some of the cobblestones were trod on by Vincent Van Gogh or Pablo Picasso in the neighborhood of Montmartre, buyers can own a piece of Paris\u2019s history, she said. \n \n \u2014 With assistance by Marie Mawad ||||| Some Paris streets still have visible cobblestone paving, but on many the stones have been buried under asphalt and are often torn up during construction.

It finally occurred to officials last March to salvage these rare gems of Parisian history and sell them to contractors so that they'd have \"a second life,\" say the head of the city maintenance yard that stores them. \"They are cheap and have some charm,\" he tells Bloomberg. In September, one enterprising woman bought five tons for $215 and set up a souvenir shop of sorts, where her team polishes, weighs, and hand-paints the stones. She sells them online for between $60 and $160, plus $15 to $40 in shipping fees. Tourists from as far afield as China and Oklahoma have paid for what entrepreneur Margaux Sainte-Lag\u00fce calls enduring little pieces of history.

If convicted, she could face life in prison, police said. \n \n Chambers, 25, is set to appear in court on Monday, the Stillwater Police Department said in a statement. \n \n The Saturday crash at the Oklahoma State University parade killed a toddler, a graduate student and a couple who'd worked at the school for decades, officials said. \n \n It also injured dozens of people, including 11 victims younger than 13. \n \n Injured victims' families await word \n \n A day later, family members of the injured waited for word as their loved ones underwent surgeries and medical tests. \n \n \"It's been a crazy 24 hours,\" Mark McNitt said, tearing up as he told reporters about the crash and its aftermath.

Leo, who was standing next to me, wasn't standing next to me. He was off to the side,\" McNitt said. \n \n Now his stepfather is one of four patients who remain in critical condition, while family members keep vigil. McNitt described his injuries as severe, but he praised doctors for their care and people from across the state for coming together during the tragedy. \n \n \"We missed the game,\" he said, \"but we feel the love, and we'll get through this.\" \n \n A family mourns \n \n Oklahoma State University President Burns Hargis called the crash an \"incomprehensible tragedy.\" In a statement, the school said three of the victims were \"members of the OSU family.\" \n \n Marvin Stone, 65, was a retired professor and researcher in the Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering. His 65-year-old wife, Bonnie, had worked for the university for more than 30 years as \"an unselfish and dedicated employee\" in Institutional Research and Information Management, the school said. \n \n Another employee at the school, Nicollete Strauch, survived the crash, but her 2-year-old son Nash was killed, the university said. Strauch, who is a sophomore majoring in chemical engineering and works in parking and transit, is recovering from injuries and devastated by her son's death, officials said. \n \n In a statement, the president of the University of Central Oklahoma said one of the people killed was Nikita Nakal, an MBA student from Mumbai, India. Police named a victim as 23-year-old Nakita Prabhakar. \n \n \"While our thoughts and prayers are with the Oklahoma State University community tonight following the tragic events during OSU's homecoming parade this morning, it is with deep sadness that I ask you to extend those sentiments to the family and friends of one of our own students,\" wrote President Don Betz. \"Our students come to Central with their unique goals, hopes and dreams, and Nikita was undoubtedly no different.\" \n \n She had been attending Saturday's parade with friends, Hargis said. \n \n Of the 47 people treated after the crash, 17 remained hospitalized and four were in critical condition Sunday, officials said. Eleven of those treated for injuries were 13 and younger, including a 1-year-old, a 3-year-old and four 6-year-olds, Stillwater police said. \n \n 'I flew over some strollers' \n \n Chambers allegedly drove her 2014 Hyundai Elantra into an unmanned police motorcycle before careening into the crowd of spectators. \n \n The deadly crash occurred at 10:31 a.m., just hours before the school's centerpiece homecoming event -- a football game between the nationally ranked, undefeated OSU Cowboys and the University of Kansas -- and only two blocks from the soon-to-be jampacked, 50,000-capacity Boone Pickens Stadium. \n \n The festive homecoming scene quickly turned into one of horror. \n \n \"I can't describe it any more clearly than this: people flying in the air,\" OSU graduate student Paul Sims said of the moment of impact. \n \n Student Kailey Carter told CNN affiliate KJRH she saw something black coming toward her. \n \n \"I didn't know what it was at first, so I just got up and ran,\" Carter said. \"The car hit me as it was stopping, and then I flew over some strollers.\" \n \n Another witness, Geoff Haxton, said he was about 100 yards from the crash site. \n \n \"All there was was smoke and panic. Half the emergency personnel in the county were here,\" Haxton said. \"People were running. (My) first instinct was to get my kids away from the street.\" \n \n Madison Atwell, 7, had six broken ribs, a concussion and stitches after the crash, her family said in a statement released through a hospital spokesman. \n \n Her aunt, Julie Franklin, was not at the parade but said the young girl had a guardian angel, with a woman at the scene pushing her out of the way as the car drove into the crowd. \n \n That guardian angel was one of the people who was killed in the crash, Franklin told KJRH. \n \n Madison's mother, Tasha, said on Facebook that her daughter had gone to the parade with her grandmother and aunt \"to experience homecoming cowboy style.\" \n \n Instead of seeing her first OSU football game, Madison had her first helicopter ride, to the hospital, her mother said. \n \n Game goes on \n \n After careful deliberation, officials decided to let the football game proceed, Hargis said. \n \n Oklahoma State University is saddened by the tragic parade incident earlier this morning. Our thoughts & prayers are with those affected. \u2014 Oklahoma State Univ. (@okstate) October 24, 2015 \n \n Before the game, the OSU football team knelt in solemn prayer at the 25-yard line. \n \n Fox Sports sportscaster Tim Brando described the pregame atmosphere as \"the kind of somber feeling\" that he'd never had before. ||||| 'Nobody knew what was going on' \n \n Sunday, October 25, 2015 | By Matt Dinger Staff writer mdinger@oklahoman.com \n \n Sunday, October 25, 2015 | By Matt Dinger Staff writer mdinger@oklahoman.com \n \n Two hours after kissing her boyfriend goodbye and leaving for work Saturday morning, a 25-year-old Stillwater woman found herself in handcuffs, accused of mowing down a crowd at the Oklahoma State University homecoming parade, injuring dozens and killing four. \n \n Adacia Avery Chambers is being held on four complaints of second-degree murder and driving under the influence of drugs. \n \n Alcohol is not believed to be involved in the crash, Payne County District Attorney Laura Austin Thomas said Sunday. \n \n Chambers has not been charged. She is expected to face a judge Monday afternoon. \n \n \u201cI don't believe right now that she was intoxicated,\u201d said Chambers' attorney, Tony Coleman. \n \n \u201cI have deep concerns about her competency at this point. I'm not a psychologist or psychiatrist, but I can tell you she's suffering from mental illness,\u201d Coleman said. \n \n An expert in alcohol intoxication, Coleman believes that his client suffered a blackout caused by underlying physical or mental problems. \n \n Her boyfriend, Jesse Gaylord, told him that she suffers from diabetes, but is not being treated or medicated for the condition, Coleman said. She also reportedly suffers from insomnia and had not slept for three days before the crash. \n \n Gaylord also reportedly interrupted two attempts by Chambers to slash her wrists, Coleman said, but doesn't think the incident was intentional or a suicide attempt. \n \n Chambers' mother also reportedly suffers from bipolar disorder and has been hospitalized in the past due to her illness, Coleman said. \n \n Coleman said he's met with people who saw Chambers the night before, the morning of and just before the incident. No one saw her drink alcohol or take drugs, he said. \n \n Gaylord told CBS News that Chambers left work at Freddy's Frozen Custard and Steakburger about a half-mile from the scene early, but he isn't sure why. \n \n \"She's a really nice girl. Hasn't shown anything, I mean... I got her up this morning and gave her a hug and kiss and she made it to work,\" Gaylord said. \n \n Chambers reportedly left the restaurant a short time after arriving for work. A witness said she appeared to be crying, but was not unsteady on her feet as she walked down a street away from the restaurant, according to the Stillwater NewsPress. \n \n What happened over the course of the next hour leading up to the crash is unknown even to Chambers, Coleman said. \n \n \"There's an area there when she doesn't remember much of anything,\" he said. \n \n She did not remember the events leading up to the crash or the wreck itself, but recalls people pulling her out of the vehicle's wreckage, Coleman said. \n \n When he met with his client Saturday night, Coleman said Chambers gave \"inappropriate\" answers to some questions and lacked emotion at moments it would be expected. \n \n \"People who know her talk of a different Adacia than the one I met,\" Coleman said. \n \n What happened \n \n At 10:31 a.m., a 2014 Hyundai Elantra traveling southbound on North Main Street at a high rate of speed crashed into an unmanned police motorcycle and continued into a crowd near the end of the parade route at North Main and Hall of Fame Avenue, just a few blocks east of the university's football stadium. \n \n The aftermath left four dead and about four dozen hurt, several critically. \n \n Dead are retired OSU professor Marvin Lyle Stone, 65; Stone's wife, Bonnie Lynn Stone, also 65 and a longtime OSU employee; Nikita Nakal, 23, a University of Central Oklahoma graduate student from Mumbai, India; and 2-year-old Nash Lucas, the son of an OSU sophomore chemistry major who also works for the university's Parking and Transit Services. \n \n Several dozen others were treated at hospitals across the state. Several were admitted, including five who were critically injured. \n \n During a news conference Sunday afternoon at OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City, OSU alumnus Mark McNitt, of Houston, described seeing his stepfather, Leo Schmitz, injured during the crash. McNitt said he felt a gush of wind, then heard a boom, followed by screams. \n \n \u201cLeo, who was standing next to me, wasn't standing next to me,\u201d McNitt said. \n \n McNitt, 49, suffered a relatively minor injury to his calf, he said. But Schmitz's injuries were more severe. He was taken by helicopter to OU Medical Center, where he remained in critical condition Sunday evening. \n \n McNitt said he spoke publicly about the crash because he wanted to give victims like his stepfather a face. McNitt described him as a \u201cgood guy, everybody loves him. He would do anything for you. He loves horses and works hard. He's a family guy, loves to have a good time. Any opportunity to see a Cowboy football game, he's there.\u201d \n \n Never could McNitt have imagined what happened instead. \n \n \u201cThe only thing I can relate it to is maybe some type of bombing. Nobody knew what was going on. All we were really concerned with was our family and friends and everybody that was injured.\u201d \n \n Still wearing the OSU Cowboys shirt and Pistol Pete baseball cap he'd worn to the parade the previous day, McNitt said the family had barely managed to snatch a couple of hours of sleep since the crash, he said. Hospital staff did a good job of keeping the family abreast of Schmitz's situation, he said. \n \n \u201cIt's been a crazy 24 hours,\u201d McNitt said, beginning to tear up. \"Everybody kept a cool head. I think Leo and the rest of the families and children are in the best hands that they can be.\u201d \n \n Odd twist \n \n Also injured was the parent of an Oologah High School band member, who came to watch the band march in the parade, said Oologah Superintendent Max Tanner. \n \n The band had completed the route before the crash occurred, Tanner said, and had gathered in Strickland Park, which is adjacent to the crash site at the corner of Hall of Fame Avenue and N Main Street. Band members didn't see the crash, he said, but a band member's mother was injured in the crash, Tanner said. \n \n In an odd twist, Chambers, the driver, is a graduate of Oologah High School. Tanner said Chambers was a member of the band for four years. \n \n Counselors will be available Monday morning for students or adults who need to talk, Tanner said. Oologah residents have handled tragedies in the past, he said. Among them was an F4 tornado that devastated the community in 1991. Those experiences have taught the town how to cope with challenges like this one, he said. \n \n \"They come together,\" he said. \"Through prayer, family and friends, they get through everything.\u201d \n \n Without bail \n \n An employee at the Freddy's, where Chambers worked, hung up the phone when contacted by a reporter Sunday. Attempts to reach the restaurant's owner were unsuccessful. \n \n \"Our thoughts and prayers are with the entire Cowboy community and everyone affected by the event that occurred Saturday morning. We are deeply saddened by this terrible tragedy and our Stillwater franchise restaurant is cooperating fully with law enforcement officials,\" Freddy's corporate spokeswoman, Alexanda Pearce, wrote in a prepared statement. \n \n Police initially arrested Chambers on the DUI complaint, but Thomas, the district attorney, asked them to add four manslaughter complaints. On Sunday morning, investigators filed an affidavit to change those complaints to second-degree murder, according to a police press release issued Sunday evening. \n \n Chambers remains in Payne County jail without bail. \n \n Contributing: Staff writers Darla Slipke, Silas Allen, Jaclyn Cosgrove, Juliana Keeping and Phillip O'Connor",

The United States headed for the polls to vote for their new president... (Associated Press) \n \n MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 The latest on world reaction to the U.S. election (all times EST): \n \n 1:50 a.m. \n \n Indonesians on social media are questioning why Americans have voted in big numbers for billionaire Donald Trump, who many in the world's most populous Muslim country perceive as intolerant and reactionary. \n \n Twitter, Facebook and chatrooms in instant messaging apps are buzzing with speculation about whether Trump would follow through on campaign rhetoric that included a ban on Muslims entering the U.S. \n \n Some people say that under a Trump administration they fear they'll be prevented from visiting relatives and friends who live in America or traveling there as tourists. \n \n About 100,000 Indonesians live in the United States. \n \n President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo says on national television that his government will work with whoever becomes president. \n \n ___ \n \n 1:45 a.m. \n \n News of Trump's widening lead hit hard in Cuba, which has spent the last two years negotiating normalization with the United States after more than 50 years of Cold War hostility. \n \n Normalization has set off a tourism boom in Cuba and visits by hundreds of executives from the U.S. and dozens of other nations newly interested in doing business on the island. Trump has promised to reverse Obama's opening with Cuba unless President Raul Castro agrees to more political freedom on the island, a concession considered a virtual impossibility. \n \n Speaking of Cuba's leaders, Communist Party member and noted economist and political scientist Esteban Morales told the Telesur network that \"they must be worried because I think this represents a new chapter.\" \n \n Carlos Alzugaray, a political scientist and retired Cuban diplomat, said a Trump victory could, however, please some hard-liners in the Cuban leadership who worried that Cuba was moving too close to the United States too quickly. \n \n While many Cubans were unaware of the state of the race early Wednesday morning, those watching state-run Telesur or listening to radio updates said they feared that a Trump victory would mean losing the few improvements they had seen in their lives thanks to the post-detente tourism boom. \n \n \"The little we've advanced, if he reverses it, it hurts us,\" taxi driver Oriel Iglesias Garcia said. \"You know tourism will go down. If Donald Trump wins and turns everything back it's really bad for us.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 1:10 a.m. \n \n A couple of Chinese participants at a U.S. Embassy event in Beijing say they'd welcome a Trump presidency, while another says he thinks the Republican candidate projects a flawed image of the United States. \n \n Blogger Wang Yiming says he hopes Trump will win because the Republican Party has been typically more willing to demonstrate American leadership globally, and he hoped a Republican president would do more to encourage freedom of speech in China. \n \n Wang says: \"I think America has stagnated and Trump represents justice, the rule of law and personal freedom.\" \n \n Lou Bin, a 43-year-old academic at a university in Beijing, says he didn't support either candidate but Trump didn't come across as much of a \"gentleman.\" He says: \"As president you want someone who represents the country's image.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 1 a.m. \n \n Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop says at this stage, it would appear that Donald Trump is most likely to claim the presidency. \n \n Bishop told reporters in Canberra, Australia's capital, that her government is ready to work with whomever the American people, \"in their wisdom,\" choose to be their president. \n \n She says a U.S. presidential election is always a momentous occasion, and in this instance, \"it has been a particularly bruising, divisive and hard-fought campaign.\" \n \n She also says the new administration will face a number of challenges, including in Asia-Pacific, and Australia wants to work constructively with the new administration to ensure the continued presence and leadership of the United States in the region. \n \n She calls the U.S. \"our major security ally\" and the largest foreign direct investor and the second-largest trading partner. \n \n She says: \"The United States is also the guarantor and defender of the rules-based international order that has underpinned so much of our economic and security issues. And interests.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 11:45 p.m. \n \n Watching the results of the U.S. election at a New Zealand bar, 22-year-old student Sarah Pereira says she is looking forward to working as an intern in the U.S. Congress, but dreads the prospect of Donald Trump winning the presidency. \n \n Pereira, a master's student in strategic studies, says she will leave for Washington this weekend after winning a scholarship to work for Democratic Congressman Gregory Meeks. \n \n She predicts the effects of a Trump on international relationships would be \"catastrophic.\" \n \n Pereira commented while attending an event hosted by the U.S. Embassy in Wellington. \n \n ___ \n \n 11:20 p.m. \n \n Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told an aide that \"the competition is closer than expected\" in the U.S. election. \n \n Aide Takeo Kawamura tells Japan's Kyodo News service that Abe is following the vote count in his office. \n \n The Japanese government has remained neutral in public statements, but analysts on both sides of the Pacific have talked about a possible change in U.S. policy toward Japan and the rest of Asia if Republican candidate Donald Trump should win. \n \n Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga is reaffirming his government's commitment to the U.S.-Japan security alliance. He tells reporters that whoever is the next president, the Japan-U.S. alliance will remain the cornerstone of Japan-U.S. diplomacy. \n \n \u2014 This item corrects spelling of Takeo. \n \n ___ \n \n 11 p.m. \n \n Chinese state media outlets are casting the U.S. election as the embodiment of America's democracy in crisis in contrast to China's perceived stability under authoritarian rule. \n \n The state-run Xinhua News Agency says the campaign has highlighted that, in its words, \"the majority of Americans are rebelling against the U.S.'s political class and financial elites.\" \n \n The official Communist Party newspaper People's Daily says in a commentary that the presidential election reveals an \"ill democracy.\" \n \n On Tuesday, the Chinese state broadcaster CCTV ran man-on-the-street interviews with unidentified American voters in which they expressed disgust with the system and dissatisfaction with both candidates. ||||| \n \n CTVNews.ca Staff \n \n \n \n \n \n Following a deeply divisive election campaign, Americans have elected Donald Trump their next president. \n \n Over the course of the campaign, Trump has made many controversial remarks about America\u2019s relationship with other countries. Here\u2019s what his presidency could mean for Canada: \n \n Trade and the economy \n \n Trump\u2019s campaign trail proclamations could spell trouble for Canadian exporters. \n \n He has slammed the North American Free Trade agreement as the \u201cworst trade deal ever.\u201d He is also against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the proposed free trade agreement between a dozen Pacific Rim countries, including Canada. \n \n One expert told The Canadian Press that Canadian officials have likely thought of specific proposals to update NAFTA and protect Canadian interests should Trump demand changes to the agreement or tear it up altogether. \n \n But others have pointed out that withdrawing from NAFTA is not that simple. The U.S. Congress would have to repeal the legislation that enables NAFTA. \n \n Daniel Kiselbach, a partner at Deloitte Tax Law LLP, told CTVNews.ca last month that if Trump moves to ditch NAFTA, American importers would likely take the U.S. government to court. \n \n Keystone XL and climate change \n \n Trump has said that he would invite TransCanada to revive its application for the pipeline, which was vetoed by President Barack Obama. The pipeline would give Alberta crude a more direct route to refineries in the U.S. \n \n Since Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has supported Keystone XL, a re-do of the pipeline approval process would likely be welcomed by the Canadian government. And if the pipeline is built in the coming years, it would be a much-needed boost for Alberta\u2019s economy. \n \n On the broader issue of climate change, Trump has vowed to \u201ccancel\u201d the Paris climate deal that U.S., Canada and nearly 200 other nations signed last year. \n \n Security and defence \n \n Trump has repeatedly vowed to deport illegal immigrants from the U.S. and institute \u201cextreme vetting\u201d of Muslim immigrants and refugees. He has also promised to implement a biometric entry-exit visa tracking system at all border crossings. \n \n Since the U.S. and Canada work closely together on national security and border issues, this could create headaches for the Canadian government. \n \n Trump has also threatened to withhold American military support from NATO if its partner countries don't meet their targeted defence spending. All NATO countries pledged to devote two per cent of their GDP to their defence budgets, but Canada is among the countries that don't hit that target. That\u2019s another potential conflict with the U.S. once Trump is sworn in. \n \n With files from CTV\u2019s Laura Payton and The Canadian Press ||||| A woman watches a television broadcast of U.S. election in Hong Kong, Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016.

What terrible news.\u201d \n \n Some viewed thundershowers that lashed the capital shortly after dusk as a sign of turbulent times to come. \n \n \u201cThe rain was an omen of the storm that is coming this evening,\u201d said Juan Antonio Diaz, 34, as the television reported the peso headed toward a record low of 20 to the dollar. \n \n Early results showing Trump running strong in key states contributed to a drop in the Mexican peso on the spot market to almost 19.8 to the dollar, a decline of 7.37% compared to the exchange rate at closing time, Bloomberg reported. \n \n At an American-themed bar in the capital, where many gathered to watch electoral results, the mood was grim: There was little laughter, dazed patrons were chain smoking, and some called relatives in the United States to find out what had happened. \n \n \"It's so worrying,\" said Roberto Ascencio, 27, a Mexican urban planner who plans to study in the U.S. next year and was among the bewildered clients at the bar, Legion Americana. \"I'm seeing my savings reduced. It's scary to see how much the peso has been reduced in the last few hours.\" \n \n For Ascencio and many other Mexicans, the prospect of a President Trump seemed unimaginable \u2014 at least until Tuesday evening. \n \n \"This is the first time I actually imagined [a Trump victory] as a real scenario,\" said Ascencio. \"I really haven't had the chance to interact with people who are supporting him.\" \n \n During the campaign, Trump had thrown his weight behind a number of controversial Mexico-related policy plans \u2014 notably vowing to build a wall along the entire U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 earning him the enmity of many here and in much of Latin America. \n \n Apart from his infamous wall, Trump had backed large-scale deportations, pledged to nix trade deals with Mexico and threatened to cut cash funds wired home by Mexican immigrants \u2014 remittances that totaled almost $25 billion last year, overtaking oil as Mexico\u2019s second-largest source of foreign currency, after manufactured goods. \n \n The peso and the Mexican stock market have been oscillating in recent weeks in close correlation to U.S. polls \u2014 dropping as Trump has risen in the polls, gaining as surveys have shown Trump on the decline. That reflects fears that the Mexican economy could slide if Trump wins. \n \n Perhaps no other country outside the United States is as invested in the election as Mexico. It is the polarizing figure of Trump \u2014 widely reviled here as a Mexico basher \u2014 that drove up interest in the U.S. presidential contest. \n \n \"American elections are always important to us, because we're neighbors,\" said Cecilia Beaven, 30, who was watching election results roll in at the Legion Americana bar. \"But this year it feels personal.\" \n \n \"What will happen to me when I'm in the U.S.?\" asked Beaven, a Fulbright scholar who will be going to the U.S. to study art next year. \"I'm scared. There has never been anyone more threatening to Mexicans and immigrants in general.\" \n \n Throughout Tuesday, the election received extensive coverage in the Mexican media, with stations featuring expert panels and hours of talking-head air time. \n \n The two major networks, Televisa and Television Azteca, dispatched anchors to the United States to direct the detailed coverage \u2014 often focusing on the expected critical role of the Latino vote. \n \n Special correspondent Cecilia Sanchez contributed to this report. \n \n ALSO \n \n How Donald Trump put together such a strong showing in the presidential election results \n \n The people at Clinton's election night party wanted to celebrate. Their plans changed \n \n The USC/L.A. Times poll saw what other surveys missed: A wave of Trump support ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks rallied on Wednesday after a dramatic overnight sell-off, while bond yields jumped on inflation expectations and the Mexican peso was battered as investors reacted to Donald Trump\u2019s surprise win in the U.S. presidential election. \n \n While equity investors\u2019 election night panic turned to daytime jubilation, bond investors worried Trump\u2019s protectionist policies would ultimately weaken the dollar and hike inflation. \n \n U.S. 30-year Treasury bond yields gained almost 25 basis points in their sharpest rise in more than five years. \n \n Benchmark U.S. 10-year note yields also advanced, climbing 21 basis points to their highest since January in their biggest increase in more than three years. \n \n The U.S. dollar rose across the board and hit its highest against the Japanese yen in nearly four months. It gained support from the equity turnaround and the yield spreads, said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York. \n \n The Mexican peso recouped some losses after falling to a record low. The currency has been vulnerable to Trump\u2019s threats to rip up a free trade agreement with Mexico and to tax money sent home by migrants to pay for building a border wall. \n \n The three major U.S. stock indexes rose as investors piled into financial and healthcare stocks on hopes of weaker regulation than was expected from a Hillary Clinton presidency. \n \n \u201cThe fact the Republicans control all three branches of government made a lot of people think that some of Trump\u2019s ideas that were pro-business - lower taxes and lower regulation - could actually be passed,\u201d Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. \n \n Goldman Sachs chief investment officer Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani advised private wealth clients to \u201cstay the course\u201d on expectations for a large stimulus that would boost investments. \n \n Traders watch, as Hillary Clinton addresses her staff and supporters about the results of the U.S. election, on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) the morning after the U.S. presidential election in New York City, U.S., November 9, 2016. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid \n \n Investors also recalled that global stocks\u2019 dramatic decline after Britain voted in June to leave the European Union was short-lived and was ultimately seen as a buying opportunity. \n \n The MSCI world stock index plunged as much 7.2 percent in the two trading sessions after the June 23 Brexit vote before rising 8.8 percent in the following 12 days. The index, which was flat on Wednesday, was 8.6 percent higher than the post Brexit low. \n \n But many money managers said they expect volatility in the coming weeks as the world awaits January\u2019s inauguration for more concrete clues of what a Trump presidency means. \n \n \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t have a history in government that people can look back at,\u201d said Meckler. \u201cWhatever he has to say in the coming weeks will have an oversized effect on the market.\u201d \n \n The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 256.95 points, or 1.4 percent, to 18,589.69, the S&P; 500 had gained 23.7 points, or 1.11 percent, to 2,163.26 and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.58 points, or 1.11 percent, to 5,251.07. \n \n UNCERTAINTY \n \n Trump\u2019s victory speech pledge that he would forge strong relations with other big nations helped ease some concerns about heavy tariffs being slapped on imports to the United States and a starkly more aggressive geopolitical attitude. \n \n But emerging markets bore the brunt of the Republican nominee\u2019s victory, with Mexico\u2019s peso still down 8.2 percent after falling more than 13 percent to hit a record low overnight. \n \n LibertyView\u2019s Meckler said he would be surprised if Asian stocks don\u2019t bounce back Thursday. MSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan ended down 2.3 percent Wednesday while Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei fell 5.4 percent. \n \n Slideshow (10 Images) \n \n In commodity markets, safe-haven gold sharply pulled back initial gains and were essentially flat at $1,275 an ounce after climbing as much as 4.9 percent to $1,337.40. \n \n Oil prices recovered along with U.S. equities, with Brent crude up 0.96 percent at $46.47 a barrel and U.S. crude rising 0.6 percent to $45.27.",

A look around: Mexico: \"I'm in shock, my stomach aches, I can't believe it. This is like watching the Titanic sink,\" a woman told the Los Angeles Times late Tuesday from Mexico City, where a thunderstorm was viewed as an omen of tumult. Mexico's peso hit a record low overnight but has recovered slightly, per Reuters. \"I'm seeing my savings reduced,\" said one man. Canada: While some Canadians are ready to welcome Americans into their \"igloos,\" others fear Trump will tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement, putting a dent in the Canadian economy, reports CTV News. If Trump approves the Keystone XL pipeline, however, it would be considered an economic win. Cuba: A political scientist says Cuba's leaders \"must be worried.\" Based on his campaign remarks, Trump is likely to reverse Obama's course of a stronger relationship. Without US tourism dollars, Cubans may suffer. But some who were hesitant that the two countries would become too cozy might actually be pleased. Indonesia: Some in the world's most populous Muslim country believe they won't be able to set foot on US soil for the next four years, per the AP. President Joko \"Jokowi\" Widodo, however, expects \"no change\" in Indonesia's \"good relations\" with the US.

The scenes of Harold gripping the arrow were later depicted in the Bayeux Tapestry. \n \n Archaeologists will now explore a claim that the king survived the battle and lived as a hermit until he died of natural causes in his eighties \u2013 about 40 years after the battle. \n \n The alternative explanation, contained in a 12th-century document housed in the British Library called Vita Haroldi, is championed by Peter Burke, an amateur historian from Waltham Abbey who has been studying an alternative English version of events for the past five years. \n \n \"We have the Norman story put through the Bayeux Tapestry \u2013 the English story is a different one,\" said Mr Burke, 64. \"You put things together and it begins to build a picture that is quite solid. If everything backs you up in history, you should look at it.

This site is roughly 15 yards away from King Harold's reputed tomb at the High Altar. \n \n English Heritage granted permission for a ground-penetrating radar to scan the area. Debbie Priddy, the inspector of ancient monuments in the East of England, said they \"were happy to give consent for this work which involves no disturbance to the nationally important archaeological remains of the abbey church\". \n \n If the scan does provide evidence, excavation may still be a while off due to the consecrated nature of the site. English Heritage would need to advise the Secretary of State to consent to excavation, in an effort to \"conserve archaeological remains for future generations\". \n \n \"I'm very hopeful we will find something,\" said Mr Burke. \"I've always thought you should question things. You shouldn't just take history at face value. [The Battle of Hastings] is one of the biggest events in English history. Whether it will go as far as rewriting history books, I suppose they'll have to,\" he said. \n \n Although Mr Burke said that he expected criticism over the search, members of the Waltham Abbey Historical Society have said the king's remains are unlikely to be found because the site has been frequently disturbed for building works. \n \n The account by Guy, Bishop of Amiens, of the East Sussex battle, which delivered a decisive Norman victory, says that Harold was killed by four knights, probably including Duke William II of Normandy, and his body dismembered.",

    "document": "Cleanup crews are working inside the Air Route Control Center in Aurora after fire, smoke and water left the place quite a mess. Technical crews are still trying to assess the damage and determine how long it will take to fix it.Brian Howard, 36, of Naperville has been charged with one felony count of Destruction of Aircraft or Aircraft Facilities after he allegedly set a fire in the basement of an Aurora FAA facility, cut the feeds to the radar and damaged the communications system, forcing a ground stop at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway international airports, the FBI says.Investigators say Howard managed to do extensive damage to the host computer, as well as the lines to radar in the facility. The Air Route Control Center monitors high altitude aircraft before landing in Chicago or flying through the area.Much of that work is being handled for the time being by other facilities in surrounding states, but at a much more limited capacity. Experts say the thousands of flights cancelled and delayed today had a definite negative impact on the economy.Illinois Senator Mark Kirk said in a statement tonight, \"I want to see not only an immediate review by the FAA of the screening process....but also a report within 30 days outlining changes the FAA will make to prevent any one individual from having this type of impact on the heart of the United States economy.\"Authorities have stressed all day they believe this was an isolated incident and that Howard acted alone.\"This is a local issue with a contract employee,\" Aurora Police Chief Greg Thomas said. \"There is no terrorist act.\"According to the criminal complaint, Howard allegedly entered the FAA facility at approximately 5:06 a.m. with a black hard-sided roller board suit case. The complaint alleges that at approximately 5:36 a.m., a message appeared on a Facebook account in Howard's name that contained a reference to the three-letter call number for the facility. The message was forwarded to law enforcement.The complaint says paramedics from the Aurora Fire Department then responded to a 911 call placed at approximately 5:42 a.m. by an individual at the FAA center. Paramedics entered the basement and followed a trail of blood that led them to Howard, officials said.\"They covered him, attempted to get him out of the building. There was some degree of effort on their part to drag him out of the building. But he was conscious. And as far as being cooperative, I would say not necessarily. They had to fight with him physically,\" Aurora Fire Department Chief John Lehman said. Howard remains hospitalized with self-inflicted stab wounds and is under police guard.Howard had worked for the Control Center as a contract employee for approximately eight years, according to the complaint. Howard was authorized to be in the building, officials said. No firearms were found on the scene, Thomas said.Howard had intimate knowledge of the building and radar system. According to ABC7 sources, he cut every radar feed to FAA air controllers before setting gas-soaked rags on fire near sensitive equipment and also damaged the communications system.Naperville police said he also made suicidal threats, prompting his family to ask for a well-being check Friday morning at his Naperville apartment. After speaking with Aurora officials, Naperville officers searched his apartment and found no victims, police said.Police said Howard had no real record, only a few minor traffic citations from 2007. Sources said he was angry he was going to be transferred with work to Hawaii.\"We don't know what his motive was at this point, and so the evidence is still being collected,\" Tom Ahern, ATF spokesperson, said.\"The scene is being worked, as with any investigation would, trying to gather all the evidence, interview all the people, collect all the information so we know what's going on,\" Thomas said.Officials said there could be days of potential radar outages at the Aurora facility, which could result in significant flight delays in the Great Lakes region. Without the Aurora facility, planes are moving in and out of Chicago at a \"reduced rate\" after airspace management was transferred to adjacent FAA facilities.There are only three routes out of Chicago right now: east toward South Bend, north to Milwaukee, and west to Rockford. Planes have to stay at a lower altitude for a longer time to maintain contact with those smaller facilities, which can only handle about 25 percent of normal operations.The FAA is beefing up staffing at those facilities and others in the area, and has not said when the repairs will be made to the Aurora building and when controllers can come back to work.Hundreds of Chicago flights were canceled, delayed and re-routed Friday. Airlines are urging travelers to check the status of their flights at www.fly.faa.gov ||||| (CNN) -- The man accused of setting a fire in an air traffic control center, causing the shutdown of operations at Chicago O'Hare International and nearby Midway Airport, sent a private Facebook message to a relative just before he started the blaze, the FBI says in an affidavit. \n \n \"Take a hard look in the mirror, I have,\" the message said, according to the affidavit. \"And this is why I am about to take out ZAU [the three-letter identification for the control center] and my life. ... So I'm gonna smoke this blunt and move on, take care everyone.\" \n \n Then, 36-year-old Brian Howard apparently started the fire in the control center basement, the affidavit said. When firefighters arrived, they found him lying on the floor and slicing his throat with a knife, the affidavit said. \n \n The FBI charged Howard, a resident of Naperville, Illinois, with one count of destruction of aircraft or aircraft facilities, a felony. Howard was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries. \n \n The fire started at about 5:40 a.m. Friday and caused the evacuation of the air traffic control center in Aurora, Illinois, which controls flights in several Midwest states. \n \n Airlines at O'Hare canceled 1,550 flights and 470 at Midway, the Chicago Department of Aviation said at 8:45 p.m. Friday. Southwest Airlines suspended all fights for the day at Midway and Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport. \n \n The ripple effect caused the cancellation of flights at airports across the nation. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport had 70 cancellations on Friday, compared to seven on Thursday, according to Flightaware, a flight-tracking website. LaGuardia Airport in New York City had 56 on Friday and 10 on Thursday. \n \n By Friday afternoon, flights to the Chicago airports had resumed at a \"reduced rate,\" authorities said. The effect of the fire on Saturday's flight activity has not been determined and it was not clear when the center would reopen. \n \n Faced transfer to Hawaii \n \n Howard had worked eight years in the center but faced a transfer to Hawaii, the FBI says in an affidavit. The documents don't specify his job title but said he worked in \"telecommunications matters.\" \n \n The FBI said Howard arrived at the control center a little after 5 a.m. dragging a \"hard-sided roller board suitcase\" into the basement, where he usually worked. He allegedly sent the Facebook message about 30 minutes after arriving and the recipient notified police. \n \n At 5:42 a.m. somebody in the control center called 911 about a fire, the affidavit said. First responders found smoke in the air, blood on the floor, exposed cables, burned towels, a gasoline can, a lighter and a knife on the floor, the affidavit said. \n \n One paramedic saw some feet sticking out from under a table and found a shirtless Howard \"in the process of actively slicing his throat with another knife,\" the affidavit said. Howard, the affidavit said, told the paramedics to \"leave me alone.\" \n \n Police obtained search warrants for Howard's home and found \"legal documents that had been laid out in a staged manner, in an attempt to make them easier to find,\" the affidavit said. The affidavit didn't describe the documents. \n \n No court date has been set for Howard. If convicted, Howard faces a possible sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a maximum fine of $ 250,000. \n \n CNN affiliate WLS reported that Howard was a machinist mate in the Navy from 1996 to 2000 with nothing unusual about his military record. He had a few traffic citations in 2007, but nothing serious, WLS said. \n \n \"He seemed like an everyday, normal kind of guy to me,\" neighbor Colin McGrath told WLS. \n \n Travelers are frustrated \n \n When the two Chicago airports shut down, controllers at other airports helped manage traffic to and from Chicago. \n \n O'Hare last year handled 883,000 takeoffs and landings, ranking it as the second-busiest airport on the planet, according to Airports Council International. \n \n Travelers stood in long lines inside the O'Hare terminal trying to rearrange flight plans. They described a frustrating scene to CNN reporters. \n \n \"There's chaos mixed with outrage,\" said Bernard Thompson of Washington, D.C., who needs to be home by Sunday for a speaking engagement. \n \n Thompson said that after his flight was canceled, the airline told him the next flight with an open seat would leave Monday. He booked a flight with another airline, only to discover the first airline couldn't locate his luggage. \n \n \"I'll get there but it's a question of whether I'll have my luggage with me,\" he said. \n \n The fire ruined travel plans at other airports. \n \n Des Moines International Airport reported 19 cancellations on Friday, according to Flightaware, including the flight that would have carried Chelsea and Bill Wright to New York City. \n \n \"We boarded our dogs and our kids are here and we got babysitters for them so it's messing everything up,\" Chelsea Wright told CNN affiliate KCCI. \n \n Other control centers pitch in to help \n \n In a typical backup plan for a disabled FAA center, the FAA could assign air traffic control authority to FAA centers in other cities, such as Indianapolis, Cleveland, Minneapolis or Kansas City. \n \n Doug Church, a spokesman for the National Air Traffic Controllers Association union, said air traffic controllers braced for a tough day. \"Indianapolis Center is one of the major facilities bearing the brunt of the extra workload today due to the Chicago Center situation,\" Church said. \n \n O'Hare is a main hub for United Airlines and other major carriers, with flights headed to international destinations. When controllers stop flights scheduled to fly to O'Hare, it has the potential to trigger a line of falling air traffic dominoes that will ruin travel plans for countless would-be passengers. \n \n Illustrating the point, the flight tracking website FlightRadar24.com showed no aircraft flying in an area stretching from eastern Iowa to central Michigan. \n \n Smoke at FAA facility stopped flights in May \n \n Friday's flight stoppages come four months after smoke at an FAA radar facility in Elgin, Illinois, prompted flight cancellations and delays at O'Hare and Midway. \n \n In that May 13 incident, most flights in and out of O'Hare were delayed by an average of an hour or more, and more than 600 flights were canceled, the Chicago Department of Aviation said. Some 75 flights were canceled at Midway. \n \n The smoke in that May incident was caused by a faulty motor in an air conditioning system, the FAA said at the time. \n \n CNN's Mike Pearson and Amanda Watts contributed to this report.",

More than 850 flights have been canceled out of Chicago's O'Hare International and Midway International airports after an employee allegedly set a fire in the basement of a major Federal Aviation Administration air traffic control center around 6am local time. The FBI is on the scene after the man was found with self-inflicted cuts to his wrist, also in the basement, WLS reports. Sources say the fire, now extinguished, was intentional and that the employee \"used accelerant to start the fire near sensitive flight equipment.\" He also may have revealed his plan online, a source says. Authorities were seen confiscating a car at the facility hours after the fire began. All employees were evacuated. Another man was treated for smoke inhalation. Apart from flights into and out of Chicago, the incident at the Aurora, Ill., center could also delay thousands of \"long-distance routes to other regions\" as the center \"controls air traffic for a giant swath of the Midwest,\" CNN reports.

    "document": "Saddle up to the gate on your next United flight and you may notice that there's now a different system in place for loading passengers. Just this week, Chicago-based United Airlines updated its boarding process to rely on fewer boarding lanes, a move that will cut down on congestion and potentially speed up passenger loading. \n \n The new boarding process has been in the works for months. In June, United started experimenting with different boarding procedures in a handful of test gates in Chicago and Houston, two of the busiest hubs in the airline's network. Now, as of this week, the official new boarding process is finally in place. \n \n Moving forward, the airline will still have five boarding groups but will only use two lanes for boarding. Elite and other priority passengers in group 1 and 2 will load through lane 1, while customers in group 3, 4 and 5 will use lane 2. Those not actively boarding will be asked to remain seated until paged. Chase co-branded credit card holders, according to the blog Wandering Aramean, will board in group 2. \n \n In addition to the new boarding process, United is also launching push notifications for those who have the airline's mobile app. Those who opt in will be given a push notification when boarding starts, a tool that will be particularly useful if a flight is delayed or if the ground crew decides to load the aircraft early. \n \n This week's updates come as the latest milestone in a long history of experimentation that United and other airlines have performed around the oft-complicated and congested boarding process. Several years ago, in an effort to better segment the cabin and speed up loading, United started using five lanes to feed through passengers. And while that method successfully segmented passengers in the boarding zone and prepared them for departure, it also created a fair amount of idle, standing passengers and congestion near the gate \u2013 especially during delays. The new strategy launched this week helps alleviate that problem. \n \n Indeed, some of United's peers are already using this simplified process. American Airlines currently boards by zone using only two lanes while Delta Air Lines splits the difference and boards with four. One difference between United and its competitors, however, is that as of this week, top tier or \"1K\" elite members will be able to pre-board before the official process starts; with most carriers only VIP passengers are given that access. \n \n New boarding lanes and gateside notifications should roll out to airports this week. ||||| CHICAGO, Nov. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- United Airlines today announced it has reached an agreement with Compa\u00f1\u00eda Paname\u00f1a de Aviaci\u00f3n S.A. (Copa), Aerov\u00edas del Continente Americano S.A. (Avianca) and many of Avianca's affiliates, for a joint business agreement (JBA) that, pending government approval, is expected to provide substantial benefits for customers, communities and the marketplace for air travel between the United States and 19 countries in Central and South America. \n \n Many more choices for customers \n \n By integrating their complementary route networks into a collaborative revenue-sharing JBA, United, Avianca and Copa plan to offer customers many benefits, including: \n \n Integrated, seamless service in more than 12,000 city pairs \n \n New nonstop routes \n \n Additional flights on existing routes \n \n Reduced travel times \n \n Drive economic benefits for consumers and the communities we serve \n \n The carriers expect the JBA to drive significant traffic growth at major gateway cities coast to coast, which is expected to help bring new investment and create more economic development opportunities. Further, the JBA is expected to provide customers with expanded codeshare flight options, competitive fares, a more streamlined travel experience and better customer service, resulting in significant projected consumer benefits. \n \n Better serve our customers \n \n Additionally, allowing the three carriers to serve customers as if they were a single airline is expected to enable the companies to better align their frequent flyer programs, coordinate flight schedules and improve airport facilities. \n \n \"This agreement represents the next chapter in U.S.-Latin American air travel,\" said Scott Kirby, United's president. \"We are excited to work with our Star Alliance partners Avianca and Copa to bring much-needed competition and growth to many underserved markets while providing a better overall experience for business and leisure customers traveling across the Western Hemisphere.\" \n \n \"We are delighted to further solidify our existing partnership with United Airlines and look forward to increasing service options for our customers by working more closely with Avianca,\" said Pedro Heilbron, Copa Airlines' chief executive officer. \"We believe this agreement benefits our passengers by providing competitive fares and a superior network of more than 275 destinations throughout Latin America and the U.S., and promotes further growth and innovation within the airline industry in the Americas.\" \n \n \"We are certain that together we are stronger in the United States \u2013 Latin America market than any of the three airlines individually,\" said Hernan Rincon, Avianca's executive president \u2013 chief executive officer. \"This partnership will allow Avianca to strengthen its position as a first-level player in the airline industry in America as we will expand our scope in the continent with United and Copa, offering better connectivity to our customers.\" \n \n JBAs drive competition that benefits customers \n \n Although JBAs have been proven around the world to benefit consumers and enhance competition, currently 99 percent of the U.S. carrier passenger traffic that makes connections in Central and South America does so without a JBA. Competition in the U.S.-Latin American market has grown and includes a diverse set of carriers offering service across multiple price points. Yet the market lacks a comprehensive revenue-sharing, metal-neutral network of carriers and the associated heightened competitive forces that drive value and better consumer experiences. The JBA represents an innovative, best-in-class new product offering that will make competition in this robust market even stronger. \n \n \"Our analysis shows that a metal-neutral JBA among United, Copa and Avianca will provide substantial benefits to consumers traveling between the relevant countries,\" said Dr. Darin Lee, executive vice president of economic consulting firm Compass Lexecon and airline industry expert. \"This JBA will enable United, Copa and Avianca to compete more effectively, offer competitive fares, and increase service, encouraging innovation and establishing a more robust and vibrant marketplace.\" \n \n To enable the deep coordination required to deliver these benefits to consumers, communities and the marketplace, United, Copa and Avianca plan to apply in the near term for regulatory approval of the JBA and an accompanying grant of antitrust immunity from the U.S. Department of Transportation and other regulatory agencies. The parties do not plan on fully implementing the JBA until they receive the necessary government approvals. The JBA currently includes cooperation between the U.S. and Central and South America, excluding Brazil. With the recently concluded Open Skies agreement between the U.S. and Brazil, the carriers are exploring the possibility of adding Brazil to the JBA. \n \n About United \n \n United Airlines and United Express operate approximately 4,700 flights a day to 356 airports across five continents. In 2017, United and United Express operated more than 1.6 million flights carrying more than 148 million customers. United is proud to have the world's most comprehensive route network, including U.S. mainland hubs in Chicago, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Newark/New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.

Travelers spilled into corridors and arriving passengers who just stepped off a flight were met with hordes of departing travelers. \n \n \"It's too congested,\" said Maria Walter, United Airlines' managing director of global operations strategy. \"It created a lot of angst from our customers.\" \n \n The airline on Tuesday debuted a new boarding process in an effort to combat this passenger pain point, and make sure flights depart on time as more travelers than ever opt to fly. \n \n United reduced the boarding lines to two from five, and is urging travelers to wait until their boarding group \u2014 numbered 1 through 5 \u2014 is called. United carried close to 155 million passengers in the 12 months ended in August, up 6.1 percent from the year-earlier period, the company said last week. \n \n The airline now sends out notifications to passengers on their mobile devices to let them now boarding has begun once the first boarding pass is scanned, so that travelers don't have to hover around the gate. \n \n Travelers would sometimes queue up an hour before a flight, Walter said, which would attract even more passengers to the line. \"It's like a magnet,\" she said. ||||| Don't crowd the gate: United rolls out a new boarding process \n \n CLOSE United says it\u2019s streamlining its boarding process. Gone are the five boarding lines used in the previous process. It is a new two-lane, color-coded process that will handle a staggered boarding call. USA TODAY \n \n United has become the latest airline to tweak the way it calls passengers to board its planes. \n \n In a change that\u2019s rolling out to United gates nationwide on Tuesday, the carrier says it\u2019s streamlining its boarding process. \n \n With that, United joins American and Delta in making changes to the boarding call since early 2017. \n \n TODAY IN THE SKY: 'Nobody is winning' the airline boarding nightmare \n \n At United, gone are the five boarding lines used in the previous process. In is a new two-lane, color-coded process that will handle a staggered boarding call. \n \n The lanes will be numbered \u201c1\u201d and \u201c2.\u201d Beyond that, lane 1 is the \u201cblue\u201d lane while lane 2 is \u201cgreen.\u201d \n \n When it\u2019s time to board, United will call pre-boarding that's open to its top-tier \u201cPremier 1K\u201d and \u201cGlobal Services\u201d frequent-flyers, active military, customers with disabilities and families with children ages 2 and younger. They'll board via lane 1. \n \n This graphic provided by United attempts to explain its new boarding process. (Photo: United Airlines) \n \n Next comes Group 1, which includes first- and business-class customers plus Platinum- and Gold-level frequent-flyers. Group 1 also boards through lane 1, while Group 2 lines up in lane 2. \n \n Group 2 boards once the Group 1 queue clears. Who is in Group 2? Silver-level frequent-fliers and certain United credit-card holders and customers who\u2019ve purchased United\u2019s priority access or boarding privileges. \n \n Travelers in Groups 3, 4 and 5 will be asked to remain seated while the first two groups line up and board. \n \n After Group 1 and Group 2 have boarded, Groups 3 through 5 will board through the green-colored Lane 2. They\u2019ll be called by number, starting with 3 and ending at 5. Group 5 will include most Basic Economy customers. \n \n Members of Group 1 and 2 who are still arriving to the gate area will priority board via the blue-colored Lane 1. \n \n United says it\u2019s implementing the boarding change after \u201ctesting a variety of boarding concepts\u201d since last fall. The new system has been in affect at Los Angeles International Airport since February and will now roll out to all United locations beginning Tuesday. \n \n United\u2019s changes hint at the struggle airlines have had in creating a boarding process that doesn't stress out customers. Even with precisely delineated groups and queues, many travelers still feel compelled to stand in line to hold their spot. \n \n Both American and Delta rolled out similar changes in early 2017. \n \n Southwest, of course, has its own type of system since it has no assigned seats. It calls for fliers in its \u201cA\u201d group to line up at their corresponding pillars, which display numbers indicating where passengers should stand. As the \u201cA\u201d group boards, Southwest repeats the process for the \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d groups until all passengers have boarded. \n \n That system, enacted in 2007, was meant to address crowding in the gate areas as customers queued up to be first on the plane. The move didn\u2019t eliminate pre-boarding line-ups, but it did add order to the process. \n \n \u201cAirlines now have so many different tiers of boarding groups, between their different levels of elite-status members and their co-branded credit card customers and others,\" Henry Harteveldt, an airline analyst and founder of San Francisco-based Atmosphere Research, told USA TODAY's Today in the Sky blog at the time. \u201cThe result is frustration, crowding, unpleasantness and stress. Nobody is winning here.\u201d \n \n TODAY IN THE SKY: Would you bid 420,000 miles to see a parked plane? These frequent-fliers did (story continues below) \n \n United said customer feedback helped push it to come up with a new system. \n \n \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\u201d Sarah Murphy, United\u2019s vice president of Global Operations Strategy, Planning and Design, said in a statement. \u201cWe listened to customers and employees as we tested a variety of processes on thousands of flights until we found a better boarding process that results in less time spent waiting in lines, improved communication and a better way to recognize our Premier customers while balancing out the number of passengers in each boarding group.\u201d \n \n One big challenge that could remain for United is how its elite-level frequent-flyers will sort themselves out in the updated process. \n \n When a large number of United\u2019s elite customers are flying on a single flight, it's been a frequent complaint in recent years that it would seem as though half the plane (or more) boarded in the first two groups. Whether elite customers now filter more evenly into the updated boarding groups on such flights remains to be seen. \n \n Stay tuned \u2026 \n \n 30 COO AVIATION PHOTOS: The last MD-11 to Dreamlifters to test planes \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2NjrbY6",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The \"angst\" travelers feel at overcrowded gates may soon be eased at United Airlines terminals, an exec for the airline says. That's because United just began a new initiative designed to relieve that particular \"passenger pain point,\" as CNBC puts it, by changing up its departure protocol: The number of boarding lines has been cut from five to two, and overeager customers are now asked to stay out of the boarding area until their boarding group (one of six in total, including pre-boarders) is announced. \"It's too congested,\" a UA rep says of the current procedure, which often results in arriving fliers having to push their way through throngs of departing ones. Forbes notes customers can also opt in to receive push notifications via the mobile app, meaning they can hang out in nearby restaurants or shops until they receive an alert on their cellphones that it's time to board. Over the past year, United test-drove a variety of boarding options on about 12,000 flights, ending up with this system, which is similar to the way American, Delta, and Southwest queue up. United has been using the procedure at LAX since winter and will now implement it at all locations, per USA Today. It's also spreading passengers around more equitably within its six boarding groups, which includes pre-boarders (e.g., families with young kids, service members), first-class passengers and frequent fliers in groups 1 and 2, and then everyone else in groups 3, 4, and 5. \"The boarding process was one of the top areas customers told us they wanted improved,\" another UA rep says in a statement, noting customer and employee feedback guided the airline on the enhancements.

    "document": "Columnist with The Sunday Times and Irish Catholic. Director of Iona Institute. Author of 'How we killed God (and other tales of modern Ireland)'. \n \n Dublin ||||| DUBLIN The people of Ireland backed same-sex marriage by a landslide in a referendum that marked a dramatic social shift in a traditionally Catholic country that only decriminalized homosexuality two decades ago. \n \n After one of the largest turnouts in a referendum there, 62 percent of voters said 'Yes', making Ireland the first country to adopt same-sex marriage via a popular vote. \n \n 'Yes' supporters crowded into the courtyard of Dublin Castle to watch in blistering sunshine as results trickled in from around the country were shown on a large screen. They cheered with joy as the final tally was announced and then burst into a rendition of the national anthem. \n \n \"We woke up today to a new Ireland. The real Irish Republic that I have dreamed of my whole life,\" said Jean Webster, a 54-year-old administrator who came out as a lesbian eight years ago after separating from her husband. \n \n Government ministers waved a rainbow flag from the stage in front of the crowd and one lesbian senator proposed to her partner live on national television. \n \n \"The answer is yes to their future, yes to their love, yes to equal marriage. That 'Yes' is heard loudly across the world as a sound of pioneering leadership from our people,\" Prime Minister Enda Kenny told a news conference. \"Ireland, thank you.\" \n \n The Catholic Church, which teaches that homosexual activity is a sin, saw its dominance of Irish politics collapse after a series of child sex abuse scandals in the early 1990s and limited its 'No' campaigning to sermons to its remaining flock. \n \n The archbishop of Dublin said the result presented a challenge. \n \n \"It is a social revolution. It's very clear that if this referendum is an affirmation of the views of young people, then the Church has a huge task ahead of it,\" Archbishop Diarmuid Martin told national broadcaster RTE. \n \n \"The Church needs to do a reality check.\" \n \n TABOO \n \n Ireland follows several Western European countries including Britain, France and Spain in allowing gay marriage, which is also legal in South Africa, Brazil, Canada and some U.S. states, while homosexuality remains taboo and often illegal in many parts of Africa and Asia. \n \n U.S. Vice President Joe Biden tweeted: \"We welcome Ireland's support for equality. #LoveWins\" \n \n After Irish expatriates flocked home to vote, 60 percent of registered voters cast their ballot, the highest in two decades. \n \n \"This is a big placard from the people of Ireland to the rest of the world saying this is the way forward,\" said David Norris, who began a campaign for gay rights in the late 1970s. \n \n The proposal was backed by all political parties, championed by big employers and endorsed by celebrities, all hoping it would mark a transformation in a country that was long regarded as one of the most socially conservative in Western Europe. \n \n Only a third of the country backed the decriminalization of gay sex for men over 17 in 1993, according to a poll at the time. When voters narrowly legalized divorce in 1995, only five of the 30 constituencies outside Dublin backed the proposal. \n \n This time, all bar one of the 43 voting areas approved the marriage measure. \n \n \"It changes everything, the worries and fears I had as a young gay kid in Ireland, they're all gone,\" said Ger O'Keefe, 27, a 'Yes' campaigner from Waterford. \n \n \"This will tell kids now that you don't need to be afraid.\" \n \n (Editing by Robin Pomeroy) ||||| Full list of results \n \n Ireland has officially passed the same-sex marraige referendum with 1.2 million people voting in its favour. The result was confirmed just before 7pm on Saturday although the result was clear from very early in the count. The Yes vote prevailed by 62 to 38 per cent with a large 60.5 per cent turnout. \n \n In total, 1,201,607 people voted in favour with 734,300 against, giving a majority of 467,307. The total valid poll was 1,935,907. \n \n Roscommon-South Leitrim was the only county to reject same-sex marriage. The No vote there finished with 51.4 per cent. \n \n Donegal, against some expectations, approved the amendment to the Constitution by a small margin. Donegal South West was on a razor edge with 50.1 per cent voting Yes, representing a margin of just 33 votes. \n \n A referendum presented simultaneously on reducing the permissible age for presidential candidates was roundly defeated. \n \n The Yes vote in Dublin in the same-sex marriage referendum was particularly pronounced. \n \n Dublin Midwest recorded a Yes vote of 70.9 per cent, Dublin South West returned 71.3 per cent, D\u00fan Laoghaire 71.6 per cent, Dublin North West 70.6 per cent and Dublin South Central 72.3 per cent, all in keeping with the 70 per cent-plus positive vote that had been anticipated in the capital. \n \n As the result emerged on Saturday afternoon thousands of people gathered in the courtyard of Dublin Castle amid scenes of widespread jubilation. \n \n Senior politicians welcomed the result, with Minister for Health Leo Varadkar saying the overwhelming Yes vote makes Ireland a \u201cbeacon of light\u201d for the rest of the world in terms of liberty and equality. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a historical day for Ireland,\u201d he told RT\u00c9, a \u201csocial revolution\u201d, adding that had any constituencies voted No, it would only have been a handful. In the end there was just one. Mr Varadkar revealed publically during the referendum campaign that he was gay. \n \n Well done, Ireland. -H \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 23, 2015 Ireland did it! The 1st country to legalize marriage equality by popular vote, but they won't be the last! What an incredible accomplishment \u2014 Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) May 23, 2015 \n \n Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin said it was now time to focus on other myriad inequalities in Irish society. \n \n \u201cI have the strong belief - there is a strong belief in the church - about the nature of marriage and the family,\u201d he said, after the result was beyond dispute. \n \n \u201cI would like to have seen that the rights of gay and lesbian men and women could have been respected without changing the definition of marriage. That hasn\u2019t happened, but that is the world we live in today.\u201d \n \n The eyes of the world have been trained on Ireland with the story featuring prominently in international media throughout the weekend. \n \n Taoiseach Enda Kenny said the referendum turnout showed the \u201cpalpable movement\u201d of people wanting to be involved. \n \n He particularly noted how young people had travelled around the country to \u201cto put a single mark\u201d on a ballot paper, demonstrating the value of the issue at hand. \n \n Paul Moran of Millward Brown told RT\u00c9 voter turnout had proved vital and that youth had driven the result, if not entirely deciding it. Social media has played a central role, he said. \n \n No campaigners congratulated the Yes side. Prominent No campaigner and director of the Iona Institute David Quinn seemed to concede the vote shortly after counting began when he tweeted: \u201cCongratulations to the Yes site. Well done.\u201d \n \n The Iona Institute issued a statement congratulating the Yes side \u201con their win\u201d which they described as \u201ca handsome victory\u201d. \n \n \u201cWe hope the Government will address the concerns voters on the No side have about the implications for freedom of religion and freedom of conscience,\u201d it concluded. \n \n No campaigner Senator Ronan Mullen said he was not surprised by the seemingly \u201cvery substantial majority\u201d in the Yes vote but remains concerned about changes to the Constitution and its negative impacts. \n \n Nobody in the No campaign thought it was going to be easy, he said. \n \n \u201cWe are operating in a political time and place in Irish culture\u201d, up against a very skilled Yes campaign which had the support of all political parties. \n \n Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, who also campaigned for a No vote, said the referendum \u201cfor me was never anti-gay\u201d. She said she had switched her vote from Yes to No simply because of her concerns around constitutional change and its effect on a child\u2019s birthright. \n \n The No advocacy group Mothers and Fathers Matter expressed \u201cwarm congratulations\u201d to the Yes side but said that one in three Irish people - the vote ratio - were not represented by the political establishment. \n \n Yes campaigner and Fianna F\u00e1il Senator Averil Power said gay campaigners who told their stories on the doorsteps of voters had \u201chelped to change Ireland for all of us\u201d, not just the gay community. \n \n She said she had seen many of them reduced to tears by the experience they had during the campaign. For them, it was often \u201can incredibly difficult thing to do\u201d. \n \n Senator David Norris, who fought from the 1970s to 1993 to have homosexuality decriminalised, welcomed the result. \u201cI believe that by the end of today gay people will be equal in this country. I think it\u2019s wonderful,\u201d he said. \n \n Minister for Children James Reilly said while the same-sex marriage referendum yes vote is strong in Dublin, it is also strong around the country. He says a lot of voters have been thinking about their grandchildren and giving them the same opportunities in life, should they be gay. \n \n US vice president Joe Biden tweeted: \u201cWe welcome Ireland\u2019s support for equality #LoveWins.\u201d \n \n As with the last referendum, media facilities were made available at Dublin Castle, and a large international contingent was in attendance. \n \n Following calls from politicians and members of the public on Friday Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW Simon Harris announced that Dublin Castle would also be open to 2,000 members of the public.",

It turns out that a curious two-spotted octopus had disassembled a water recycling valve and directed a tube to spew out of the tank for about 10 hours, according to the Los Angeles Times. \n \n \n \n \"It found something loose and just pulled on it,\" the aquarium's education manager Tara Treiber told the Times. \"They are very smart creatures.\" \n \n \n \n Octopuses, some 300 species of which inhabit tropical waters around the world, can change colors, squirt out poison, and exert a force greater than their own body weight. But calling the eight-armed cousin of your garden snail \"smart\" seems a bit of a stretch. In fact, the animals are part of an elite group of slimy mollusks known as cephalopods that range from giant squid to the shelled nautilus and all have remarkably large \"brains\"\u2014at least for creatures sans backbones. \n \n Scientists have found that octopuses can navigate their way through mazes, solve problems quickly and remember those solutions, at least for the short term. \n \n \n \n To find out more about octopus intelligence, we spoke to Jennifer Mather, a comparative psychologist at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada. Mather has been studying octopuses for 35 years in an effort to gain insight into the evolution of intelligence. While most scientists hold octopuses in high regard, it's worth noting that not everyone shares Mather's lofty assessment of their intellectual abilities and personalities. \n \n \n \n [An edited transcript of the interview follows.] \n \n \n \n Are octopuses smart? \n \n Yes, but of course one has to ask what that means. I would say intelligence means learning information and using the information that you've learned. \n \n \n \n So, how do you know they are smart? \n \n We observed how octopuses figure out how to open clams and what sort of flexibility and variety they have. We give them clams and mussels in order to figure out which they like best. They are very strong, but we found they prefer mussels because mussels are easier to open. They switched to clams when we put the clams on a half shell. They clearly made a decision to go with what was easiest. We noticed along the way that yanking them open wasn't the only thing the octopuses could do to open them. They have a cartilaginous beak, which looks a lot like a parrot's beak, and they could chip at the edge of the clamshell and then they could inject poison and weaken the clam. Or they actually have a salivary papilla, and they can drill a hole to inject the toxin that way in the stronger clams. They were selective about what technique they would use with what species. We decided we would cheat on them: We took one of the easier ones and wired them shut. They switched techniques according to what would work best. Of course, this doesn't sound hard to you because you're a human, but most simple animals keep trying the same technique. \n \n \n \n What other indications are there that octopuses are intelligent? \n \n Octopuses play, and play is something that intelligent animals do. At the Seattle Aquarium, my colleague Roland Anderson and I figured out a situation in which they might play: a boring situation. We gave them an empty tank and a floating pill bottle and waited to see what would happen. Nothing happened the first time, but, after the fourth time, a couple animals did something we call \"play.\" The octopus blew a jet of water at the pill bottle and that caused it to go over a water jet in the tank and come back to the octopus. These two individual animals did it in a sequence over 20 times. That's just exactly the kind of thing we do when we bounce a ball. When you bounce a ball, you are not trying to get rid of the ball, you are trying to figure out what you can do with the ball. \n \n \n \n Octopuses also have personalities. We used the same kind of setup people use when they want to study human personalities. You just ask what do the animals commonly encounter during the day in different situations and look at the variability. We put them in three common situations: alerting (opening the top of the tank), threatening (touching the octopus with a test tube brush) and feeding (the octopus was given a crab to munch). This takes awhile because we tested 33 animals, each for two weeks. We found there are three dimensions and we settled for names: activity, reactivity and avoidance. Avoidance is how shy you are. Activity is if you are very active or passive. And reactivity indicates whether you are very emotional or more blas\u00e9. Octopuses can have any mix of those traits. We didn't take it any further, but there's a former graduate student in Australia looking at the extent to which personality affects ecology. \n \n \n \n Do octopuses have brains? \n \n The molluscan nervous system has a bunch of paired ganglia (a cluster of nerve cells), which in an animal like a clam or a snail are not very big and are widely distributed through the body. They control different functions and are located in different areas. Well, the cephalopods\u2014that's the octopuses, squids and cuttlefish\u2014they are unique in that all these ganglias have condensed so they form a centralized brain. The other thing that is unique amongst the mollusks is there are two areas of this brain that have developed that are specialized for memory storage. It's not just that the brain is larger and condensed, but they have areas of the brain dedicated to learning. That's the kind of thing we humans have, but it\u2019s a completely different brain. \n \n \n \n By invertebrate standards it\u2019s a huge brain, but by vertebrate standards, it\u2019s a small brain. What's interesting about the octopus is about one third of the neurons (nerve cells) are in the brain. They have a huge neural representation in the arms, and there's a ganglion controlling every sucker, so there's quite a bit of local control. As humans, we're very proud of having a pincer grasp\u2014the thumb and forefinger\u2014and we say that's responsible for our ability to manipulate the environment so well. The octopus can fold the two sides of its sucker together to form a pincer grasp and it can do that with every single one. It has a hundred pincer grasps. \n \n \n \n Why do you think octopuses evolved such big brains? \n \n Probably because the tropical coral reef is the most complex environment in the world. There's such a huge variety of situations, lots of kinds of prey, lots of predators, and if you are not armored, you'd better be smart. The octopus has gone the smart route. Also, we talk about mammalian intelligence evolving in social situations, but clearly the octopus, a solitary organism, has evolved intelligence to solve ecological problems. \n \n \n \n Do octopuses often cause trouble in aquariums? \n \n They are very strong, and it is practically impossible to keep an octopus in a tank unless you are very lucky. One of the early researchers said if you leave a floating thermometer in a tank, it will last about five minutes. Octopuses simply take things apart. I recall reading about someone who had built a robot submarine to putter around in a large aquarium tank. The octopus got a hold of it and took it apart piece by piece. There's a famous story from the Brighton Aquarium in England 100 years ago that an octopus there got out of its tank at night when no one was watching, went to the tank next door and ate one of the lumpfish and went back to his own tank and was sitting there the next morning. The aquarium lost several lumpfish before they figured out who was responsible.",

    "document": "Seattle-based Investigative Reporter Chris Halsne (KIROTV- CBS- COX MEDIA GROUP) just returned from El Salvador, where he interviewed a U.S. government subcontractor who worked extensively with the Secret Service advance team (snipers, K-9 and explosives sweeps) in San Salvador prior to President Obama\u2019s trip there in March of 2011. \n \n The eyewitness says he joined about a dozen Secret Service agents and a few U.S. military specialists at a strip club in San Salvador a few days before President Obama and his family arrived in El Salvador to meet with its new president, Mauricio Funes. \n \n This source witnessed the majority of the men drink heavily (\"wasted,\" \"heavily intoxicated\") at the strip club. He says most of the Secret Service \"advance-team\" members also paid extra for access to the VIP section of the club where they were provided a number of sexual favors in return for their cash. Although our source says he told the agents it was a \"really bad idea\" to take the strippers back to their hotel rooms, several agents bragged that they \"did this all the time\" and \"not to worry about it.\" Our source says at least two agents had escorts check into their rooms. It is unclear whether the escorts who returned to the hotels were some of the strippers from the same club. \n \n These alleged incidents in El Salvador occurred a full year prior to recent revelations that secret service agents used prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia, on a presidential trip this month. \n \n To further confirm information provided about behaviors in El Salvador that reportedly occurred in March of 2011, Halsne interviewed the owner of the San Salvador strip club in which the subcontractor said they visited. The strip club\u2019s owner confirmed a large number of U.S. secret service agents (and some military escorts) \u201cdescended on his club\u201d that week prior to President Obama\u2019s visit. He claims agents were there at least three nights in a row. \"No surprise to me.\" The owner told Halsne his club routinely takes care of high-ranking employees of the U.S. embassy in San Salvador as well as visiting FBI and DEA agents. The owner says his reputation for \"security\" and \"privacy\" makes him a popular strip club owner with \"those who want to be discreet.\" He told Halsne during a lengthy interview, he doesn\u2019t allow prostitution inside the club and that all his \"girls\" are at least 18-years-old. He says the girls can do what they want after work, but he discourages them from making contact with customers at other locations. \n \n This investigation is still fast-developing. Halsne has names of some of the agents allegedly involved in the partying and has viewed records which add credibility to the subcontractor\u2019s eyewitness testimony. KIRO-TV is currently writing and editing-together a series of television stories for air beginning at 5 p.m. on Thursday, April 26. ||||| ADVERTISEMENT \n \n The station also interviewed the owner of the strip club, who corroborated the allegations. The story is largely similar to the events that led up to an incident in Colombia earlier this month that prompted a widespread investigation into the agency.The Secret Service said Thursday it was investigating the report.\"The recent investigation in Cartagena has generated several news stories that contain allegations by mostly unnamed sources. Any information that is brought to our attention that can be assessed as credible will be followed up on in an appropriate manner,\" said Secret Service spokesman Max Milien in a statement.The Department of Defense did not respond to a request for comment.On Sunday, House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.) said he believed that there were instances of misconduct by Secret Service agents prior to the Colombian prostitution scandal that has led to a number of resignations and firings and shaken confidence in the agency tasked with protecting the president.\"Things like this don't happen once if they didn't happen before,\" Issa told CBS News. \n \n Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said the report was further evidence of the need for an independent investigation into the agency. \n \n \n \n \u201cThis latest allegation only reaffirms the need for independent investigations by the Inspector General. Regardless of whether the incidents were previously referred to internal investigators, they need to be examined,\" Grassley said. \"There are rumors flying about various incidents over several years about the conduct of Secret Service personnel, as well as other law enforcement and military personnel in locations around the world. The only way to put to rest the rumors of a much wider problem is for the allegations to receive transparent and independent reviews.\u201d \n \n \n \n But Wednesday, Napolitano insisted that there was no evidence of additional misconduct. \n \n \n \n \u201cThere was nothing in the record to suggest that this behavior would happen and it really was, I think, a huge disappointment to the men and women of the Secret Service,\u201d Napolitano said. \n \n",

On the night the Costa Concordia ran aground, she had dinner with the captain before he invited her to join him on the bridge as he oversaw what was meant to be a close sail-past of the little Tuscan island of Giglio. \n \n Local press have speculated the captain may have been distracted by her presence, or even showing off. \n \n In court, Ms Cemortan acknowledged after being pressed that they had been romantically involved. She had boarded the ship as a non-paying passenger hours before the crash, she said, adding: \"When you are someone's lover, no-one asks you for a ticket.\" She subsequently dismissed the remark as a joke to her translator. \n \n She said she had worked for the company that operated the Costa Concordia for about three weeks in December 2011, and had met Capt Schettino on a previous cruise. \n \n Image caption Capt Francesco Schettino blamed his Indonesian helmsman for steering the ship onto rocks \n \n After the ship hit the rocks, Ms Cemortan said the captain urged her to \"save herself\". \n \n She told court that she helped other passengers to abandon ship before getting into a lifeboat herself. \n \n Trial to take weeks \n \n The court is expected to hear evidence from about 1,000 surviving passengers and crew during Capt Schettino's trial. \n \n In testimony earlier in the day, ship maitre d' Antonello Tievoli told the court in Grossetto, Tuscany, that he had asked the captain if he could sail close to the island of Giglio because he has family there, the news agency AP reported. \n \n The captain obliged on 6 January, but was apparently disappointed with the result, and ordered the ship's helmsman to plot a closer route for next time. \n \n A week later, the ship ran aground on rocks after veering too close to the island, with 3,206 passengers and 1,023 crew aboard. \n \n The captain has acknowledged fault in the tragedy, but his defence team is arguing the ship sank in part because watertight doors did not function on the ship. \n \n He also told the court in late September that his Indonesian helmsman was to blame for steering the ship onto rocks and ignoring orders to slow down. \n \n Image caption The route of the Costa Concordia \n \n However, an Italian naval expert told the trial these were not crucial factors and the crash would have happened anyway. \n \n The helmsman, Jacob Rusli Bin, is one of five employees who were granted plea bargains in return for mild sentences in a separate proceeding. He was given a sentence of one year and eight months. \n \n The 290m-long vessel was righted last month in one of the largest, most complex salvage operations ever that took 18 hours and followed months of stabilisation and preparation work by a team of 500 engineers and divers. \n \n That operation allowed divers to retrieve the remains of one of the two people still missing in the disaster, believed to be an Italian passenger, Maria Grazia Trecarichi. An Indian waiter, Russel Rebello, is still unaccounted for. \n \n Plans are now being made to attempt to remove the wreckage of the ship next year. \n \n Image caption The Costa Concordia was righted in September \n \n Correction 30 October 2013: We initially reported that the remains of Russel Rebello, not Maria Grazia Trecharichi, had been found, based on out-of-date information. ||||| A Moldovan dancer who had been on the bridge of the Costa Concordia cruise ship when it crashed into a reef off Italy electrified the captain's manslaughter trial Tuesday by testifying reluctantly that the two were lovers. \n \n Domnica Cemortan, from Moldova, leaves the converted Teatro Moderno theater after testifying in a hearing in the trial of Captain Francesco Schettino, in Grosseto, Italy, Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2013.

The... (Associated Press) \n \n Domnica Cemortan, 26, only made the admission after being warned by the judge that she risked criminal charges if she didn't answer the question. \n \n The ship's former captain, Francesco Schettino, is the sole defendant on trial in the Tuscan town of Grosseto. He is charged with manslaughter for the 32 people who died in the crash, with causing the shipwreck on the night of Jan. 13, 2012, and with abandoning ship while many passengers and crew were still aboard. He risks 20 years in jail if convicted. \n \n Earlier in the day, ship ma??tre d' Antonello Tievoli testified that 10 days before the crash, he had asked Schettino for a favor: Would the captain sail close to the island of Giglio during the Mediterranean cruise because the crewman's family lived there? \n \n Heads in the courtroom turned Tuesday when Cemortan strode in wearing high-heeled pumps and a figure-hugging black top and skirt. She was questioned both by prosecutors and lawyers for the survivors who have attached civil suits to the manslaughter trial. \n \n Testifying through a translator, Cemortan said she had worked on the Concordia for three weeks in December 2011. She then re-boarded the ship in January 2012 as a non-paying passenger several hours before the crash near Giglio. \n \n \"When you are someone's lover no one asks you for any explanations\" about not having a ticket, she told the court. \n \n Some in the courtroom gasped at the bold remark. Cemortan insisted her comment was a joke, but the judge made it part of the trial record. \n \n As she testified, Schettino, who is married, sat at the defense table making a series of classic Italian hand gestures indicating incredulity. \n \n Cemortan repeatedly declined to answer whether she is or had been romantically involved with Schettino, relenting only after Judge Giovanni Puliatti warned her that she risked criminal charges. \n \n Tievoli, the maitre'd, said on Jan. 6, 2012, exactly a week before the collision, the cruise ship sailed closer than usual to Giglio and he thanked Schettino for the courtesy. Still, Tievoli recalled that Schettino was disappointed with that route and ordered his No. 2 officer to devise an even closer approach to the tiny island the following fateful week. \n \n When the Concordia rammed into the reef the night of Jan. 13, gashing its hull and quickly taking on water, many of the passengers were enjoying a gala supper. Cemortan said she had dined at the captain's table with him, and he told crew to slow down the ship so he could have dessert before taking the helm near Giglio. \n \n They both were on the bridge at the time of the crash. After it, Cemortan testified that she dashed into Schettino's private cabin to change out of her dinner outfit into more practical clothes. She noticed his laptop in the room and took it because she thought it was important. She said she gave it to him when she saw him on Giglio before dawn, after they both had taken separate lifeboats to the island. \n \n Cemortan told the court Schettino told her immediately after the crash to take good care of a high-ranking crew member who is the brother of the former director-general of Costa Crociere SpA, the Italian cruise line. \n \n She testified that the crew member, Ciro Onorato, pushed her onto a lifeboat. Because of the confusion and the darkness on the moonless night, she said she couldn't say if any passengers were still aboard the ship when she left the Concordia. \n \n Hours after Schettino left aboard a lifeboat and was spotted on Giglio, Italian rescue helicopters plucked many survivors from the capsized ship. Many other passengers jumped into the sea to try to swim to Giglio and some drowned. \n \n Cemortan said she and others aboard her lifeboat pulled several people out of the water. \n \n Cemortan is among those seeking damages from the captain. \n \n `'Today I died a second time,\" she told reporters outside the court, contending that she had suffered psychological trauma due to the shipwreck. \n \n Last month, a spectacular maritime salvage operation righted the Concordia after 20 months of lying half-submerged on its side off the port of Giglio. The ship will eventually be towed away and broken up for scrap.",

    "document": "Donald Trump wants to build a wall on the Mexico-US border \u2014 a big, beautiful wall, of course. And while this idea may sound inherently ridiculous to a lot of people, Trump is very serious about it. So on Sunday's Last Week Tonight, Oliver decided to take Trump's primary policy proposal seriously. \n \n There are lots of problems, according to Oliver: \n \n Cost: Trump has at varying times estimated that the wall will cost anywhere from $4 billion to $12 billion. But according to the Washington Post, experts put the estimate closer to at least $25 billion. And while Trump insists Mexico will pay for the wall, there is zero evidence for that: Mexican officials have flat-out rejected the idea. \n \n Trump has at varying times estimated that the wall will cost anywhere from $4 billion to $12 billion.

And while Trump insists Mexico will pay for the wall, there is zero evidence for that: Mexican officials have flat-out rejected the idea. Geography: Where does the wall go? As Oliver points out, this isn't as easy a question to answer as you might think. Large parts of the border are made up of the Rio Grande river. The wall can't be built to obstruct the flow of the river, per a 1970 treaty. \n \n \n \n As a consequence, big parts of the border fence approved in 2006 were built inland, sometimes actually blocking off US territory, such as the Fort Brown Memorial Golf Course. As the Guardian put it, the fence has turned into a \"costly logistical nightmare.\" \n \n Where does the wall go? As Oliver points out, this isn't as easy a question to answer as you might think. Large parts of the border are made up of the Rio Grande river. The wall can't be built to obstruct the flow of the river, per a 1970 treaty. As a consequence, big parts of the border fence approved in 2006 were built inland, sometimes actually blocking off US territory, such as the Fort Brown Memorial Golf Course. As the Guardian put it, the fence has turned into a \"costly logistical nightmare.\" Effectiveness: It's not clear whether the wall would do much, if anything, to stop the flow of unauthorized immigrants into the US. In a 2006 report, the Pew Research Center estimated that \"nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials\" \u2014 and then they just remained in the country without authorization. A wall wouldn't stop them. \n \n \n \n Not to mention all the people who would get around the wall with a ladder, rope, or underground tunnel. \n \n Does this matter to Trump and his supporters? Maybe not. As Oliver noted, many people may want the wall as a symbol \u2014 it feels like it keeps the US safe. Trump has said it keeps out Mexican immigrants whom he characterized as \"rapists\" and \"criminals.\" But a century of empirical research suggests Trump is wrong: Immigrants are potentially less, not more, likely to commit crime than their native-born counterparts. So it's not clear just how much safer it would make America. \n \n Ultimately, Oliver suggested that buying a $75 electric waffle iron for every American would be a better use of the money than building a wall. \n \n \"I know what you're thinking: 'John, this is a stupid idea.' But is it? Is it, really? Yes, obviously, it is,\" Oliver said. \"But is it significantly stupider than Donald Trump's wall? Because this waffle iron plan will cost less, it'll do nearly as much to keep out immigrants and drugs, it won't harm our relationship with our third-largest trading partner, if it is racist it's only toward Belgians, and, unlike Donald Trump's wall, this makes fucking waffles.\" \n \n Watch: Donald Trump's rise is a scary moment in America ||||| If there\u2019s one policy proposal Donald Trump has outlined in great detail, it\u2019s his idea to build a wall along the border between the United States and Mexico\u2014and, of course, to make Mexico pay for it. While the proposal has made a great talking point for Trump, it has also drawn a lot of well-deserved criticism\u2014and on Sunday night\u2019s episode of Last Week Tonight, John Oliver delivered what might be the most thorough takedown yet. \n \n \n \n At first, Oliver put aside the obvious racism implied by such a plan and instead tackled the absurdity of the plan itself\u2014highlighting its rising proposed costs, the silliness of believing Mexico would pay for it (even as Mexican officials insist they would not), and the practical complications of actually building the wall itself. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting a pet walrus,\u201d Oliver said. \u201cYou think it\u2019s stupid now? Wait until you find out what a bucket of sea cucumbers costs.\u201d And then there\u2019s the fact that the 30-foot wall could be surmounted by something as simple as a 31-foot ladder. \n \n \n \n But of course Oliver wasn\u2019t going to leave the racism and xenophobia aside for good. In fact, Trump\u2019s comments that frame immigrants as criminals ignore the data that show that immigrants are less crime-prone than their native-born counterparts. So Oliver ended the segment by making a counterproposal, putting forward a plan that would cost less and do a better job of giving Americans what they truly crave: a warm feeling inside. ||||| + READ ARTICLE \n \n \n \n \n \n In the wake of his nearly successful campaign to #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain (or at least sell a lot of hats emblazoned with the slogan), John Oliver once again has Donald Trump in his show\u2019s cross hairs. \n \n Last night, Oliver spent a new episode of Last Week Tonight doing his impression of the Kool Aid Man, knocking down the wall that the Republican presidential candidate wants to build to separate Mexico and the United States in order to curtail illegal immigration. While Trump has estimated the wall would only cost $4 billion, Oliver notes that, \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s margin of error is only the GDP of Moldova.\u201d Oliver did the math on the project and the cost in both dollars and common sense is much more. \n \n In his take down of the idea, Oliver noted that the wall would cost an estimated $26 billion, would sit on on private property, could take up to ten years to build and has serious effectiveness issues. Oliver believes there is a better way to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain \u2014 buy everyone waffle irons. \n \n And, yes, he knows he looks like a pygmy owl when he delivers the news. \n \n While the majority of the episode was dedicated to Trump\u2019s wall, the show ended with a very important poll question: \n \n Which dog would make the best Merrick Garland on their Dog Supreme Court?

Photograph: Eduardo Munoz/Reuters \n \n Donald Trump\u2019s successful campaign to become US president has claimed one of its first economic victims after luxury jeweller Tiffany blamed protests at Trump Tower for hitting sales at its flagship store. \n \n Many of the demonstrations before and after the election have centred on the president-elect\u2019s skyscraper in midtown Manhattan, located on the same block as the jewellery store on Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. \n \n The site, described by the luxury goods company as \u201csimply the most famous store there is\u201d, is a tourist attraction almost as much as a retail outlet, mainly because of the enduring image of Audrey Hepburn\u2019s alfresco dining and window shopping in the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s. \n \n While sightseers have never appeared to scare away customers, political protesters might be viewed differently by Tiffany\u2019s moneyed clients, at least according to a carefully worded results statement to Wall Street on Tuesday. \n \n \u201cWith respect to the impact of recent election-related activity near the company\u2019s New York flagship store, management has noted some adverse effect on traffic in that store and a continuation of sales softness relative to prior year and to the company\u2019s other US stores this year,\u201d the company said. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest A protest outside Trump Tower on 12 November. Tiffany\u2019s results do not cover the post-election period. Photograph: Kena Betancur/AFP/Getty Images \n \n \u201cThat store represented less than 10% of worldwide net sales for the three and nine-month periods ended 31 October 2016, as well as for each quarter in fiscal 2015. The company cannot provide any assurance that sales in that store will not be negatively affected by this activity in the fourth quarter or in any future period.\u201d \n \n The results take in the three months to the end of October, so do not include the final days before the election, nor the 8 November result, which led to further protests at the site. \n \n Tiffany said worldwide net sales rose by 1% to $949m (\u00a3761m) and comparable store sales fell by 2% over the period. \n \n Its chief executive, Frederic Cumenal, remained cautious about the company\u2019s prospects following a mixed year, with low bonuses for Wall Street bankers and weaker spending from foreign tourists. \n \n \u201cWe are encouraged by some early signs of improvement in sales trends, but we clearly need more positive data over time before this can be considered an inflection point,\u201d he said. ||||| Tiffany & Co (TIF.N) reported its first rise in sales in two years as more people shopped in its stores in Japan and China, and the upscale jeweler said sales in the United States declined at their slowest quarterly pace this year. \n \n The company's shares rose as much as 8 percent on Tuesday, their highest in 15 months. \n \n However, the luxury retailer - whose flagship store is next to the Trump Tower in New York - said it could not guarantee that sales in the current quarter would not be affected by protests and stepped-up security in the area since the election. \n \n While traffic has slowed at Tiffany's 5th Avenue store, it accounts for \"less than 10 percent\" of net sales, Tiffany said. \n \n The company said Japanese shoppers bought more at home and in the United States, in the third quarter ended Oct. 31, as the yen strengthened against the dollar. \n \n Net sales increased 1.2 percent to $949.3 million, beating the average analysts' estimate of $923.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \n \n \"The 1 percent uplift is modest, but it is far better than the string of poor numbers the company has been posting for well over a year,\" said Neil Saunders, chief executive of research firm Conlumino. \n \n \"That said, the figures do not show that all the problems at Tiffany have been resolved.\" \n \n Tiffany has been struggling to bring back wealthy American shoppers to its stores and woo hard-to-please millennials who are turning to cheaper and hipper brands such Denmark's Pandora A/S (PNDORA.CO) and online jeweler Blue Nile. \n \n In response, Tiffany has launched new silver products priced below $500 and has also aggressively marketed its diamond engagement rings. \n \n The strategy appears to be working. The company said on Tuesday that fashion jewelry performed well in the quarter, helped by higher sales of gold bracelets from its \"Tiffany T\" collection. \n \n TRUMP TOWER TROUBLES \n \n Tiffany, however, said sales at its stores open at least a year fell 2 percent in the quarter. Analysts on average had expected a 2.8 percent decline, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. \n \n While the company reaffirmed its full-year forecast of a decline in sales and adjusted earnings per share, it said it would remain cautious about how the Trump protests might impact sales over the coming weeks. \n \n While protests have eased in the neighborhood, the Tiffany store is still caught up in the Trump Tower security cordon. \n \n Amy Jones, a 22-year-old tourist from Liverpool, England, related to Reuters last week how she was able to buy a ring quickly from Tiffany because there were so few shoppers there, \"probably because of all the madness surrounding Trump.\" \n \n Fifth Avenue hosts some of the biggest names in luxury retailing, including Gucci, Prada and Armani. \n \n Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough, however, said the problem was short term in nature and wouldn't hurt holiday season sales much. \n \n Tiffany said third-quarter sales in China rose by \"double-digits\" while those in the United States, Canada and Latin America declined at the slowest pace in five quarters. \n \n Net income rose 4.5 percent to $95.1 million, or 76 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 67 cents per share. \n \n The company's shares had risen about 7 percent this year, through Monday's close. \n \n (Reporting by Abhijith Ganapavaram in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by Melissa Fares and Steve Holland in New York; Editing by Ted Kerr and Sayantani Ghosh)",

We have a stratospheric divorce rate and a surge of single parents. Couples who stay together are often trapped in sexless, passionless unions. An entire industry \u2014 from couples therapy to sex supplements \u2014 has emerged to help people \"rekindle the spark\" without straying from the confines of monogamy. \n \n But Ryan and Jeth\u00e1 also have a theory for what's causing this misery: From a biological perspective, men and women simply aren't meant to be in lifelong monogamous unions. In \"Sex at Dawn,\" which uses evidence gathered from human physiology, archaeology, primate biology and anthropological studies of pre-agricultural tribes from around the world, they argue that monogamy and the nuclear family are more recent inventions than most of us would expect \u2014 and far less natural than we've come to believe. \n \n Before the advent of agriculture, they argue, prehistoric humans lived in a much less sexually possessive culture, without the kind of lifelong coupling that currently exists in most countries. They also point to the bonobos, our closest relatives, who live in egalitarian and peaceful groups and have astronomical rates of sexual interaction, as evidence of our natural inclinations. While Ryan and Jeth\u00e1's book (Ryan is a psychologist, and Jeth\u00e1 a practicing psychiatrist, in Spain) is often a bit scattered and hard to follow, its provocative argument is also impossible to dismiss. \n \n Salon spoke to Ryan over the phone from Barcelona about the problem with American marriages, why gay men understand relationships better than straight men, and the hidden meaning of human testicle size. \n \n You paint a bleak picture of the state of marriage in the West, particularly in the United States. What makes it so bad? \n \n Marriage in the West isn\u2019t doing very well because it\u2019s in direct confrontation with the evolved reality of our species. What we argue in the book is that the best way to increase marital stability, which in the modern world is an important part of social stability, is to develop a more tolerant and realistic understanding of human sexuality and how human sexuality is being distorted by our modern conception of marriage. Certainly growing up in the '70s and '80s there were very few kids I knew whose parents weren\u2019t divorced at least once. The economic, emotional, psychological cost of fractured relationships is a major problem in American society \u2014 with single mothers and single-parent families. \n \n You argue that much of this misery stems from changes that occurred when humans developed agriculture, around 8000 B.C. What happened? \n \n The advent of agriculture changed everything about human society, from sexuality to politics to economics to health to diet to exercise patterns to work-versus-rest patterns. It introduced the notion of property into sexuality. Property wasn\u2019t a very important consideration when people were living in small, foraging groups where most things were shared, including food, childcare, shelter and defense. It makes perfect sense that sexuality would also be shared \u2014 why wouldn\u2019t it be when paternity wasn\u2019t an issue? \n \n When you have agriculture, men started to worry about whether or not certain children were theirs biologically, because they wanted to leave their accumulated property to their own child. At that point, people also made a very clear connection between sexual behavior and birth. Lots of people didn't have a very clear understanding of the cause and effect of sex and birth, but when you have domesticated animals living side by side with people, they start to notice that the characteristics of a certain male that has mated with a certain female show up in the offspring. \n \n One of the central ideas of much biological and genetic theory is that animals will expend more energy protecting those they\u2019re genetically related to \u2014 siblings, parents, offspring \u2014 as opposed to those they're not related to. Why wouldn't that apply to humans? \n \n There are many, many exceptions to that rule in nature. One of the exceptions we talk about in the book are the vampire bats that share blood with each other. They go out and they suck the blood at night and then they come back to the cave and the bats that didn\u2019t get any blood will receive blood from other bats. They share, and that has nothing to do with genetic connection. And in terms of animals that are much more closely related to humans, when you look at bonobos and their promiscuous interaction, it\u2019s virtually impossible for a male to know which of his offspring are related to him biologically. So to say that there\u2019s this inherent concern with paternity within our species, I just don\u2019t see evidence for that. \n \n Does this mean that humans didn't form couples before the advent of agriculture? \n \n Because human groups at the time knew each other so well and spent their lives together and were all interrelated and depended upon each other for everything, they really knew each other much better than most of us know our sexual partners today. We don\u2019t argue that people didn\u2019t form very special relationships \u2014 you can see this even in chimps and bonobos and other primates, but that bond doesn\u2019t necessarily extend to sexual exclusivity. People have said that we\u2019re arguing against love \u2014 but we're just saying that this insistence that love and sex always go together is erroneous. \n \n Given that these people have been dead for thousands of years, and we don't have a fossil record of sexual activity, isn't this hard to prove? \n \n The evidence comes from several different areas. We look at pre-agricultural people who have been studied today and horticultural people who have been studied by anthropologists. There\u2019s a fair amount of information about the sexuality of people who haven\u2019t been deeply exposed to Western influence. There are accounts from travelers and colonialists, first-contact accounts from historical records, that we rely on. But you can also extract a great deal of information from the human body itself \u2014 from the design of the penis to the volume of the testicles to the sperm-producing potential of the testicular tissue and the way we have sex. \n \n What does our testicle size tell us about the way we have sex? \n \n Our testicles aren\u2019t as big as those of chimps and bonobos, but our ejaculation is about four times as big in terms of volume. The theory is that when males compete on the level of the sperm cell, they develop much larger testicles, because in promiscuous animals, the sperm of the different males is competing with the sperm of other males to get to be the first to the egg. And the fact that our testicles are not as small relative to our body as the monogamous gibbon or gorillas reinforces the idea that we have been non-monogamous for a long time. \n \n Plus the design of our penis strongly suggests that it evolved to create a vacuum in the female reproductive system, thereby pulling out the semen of anyone who was there previously. There are all kinds of indications of sperm competition in the human male. And one of the things that we suggest in the book that no one else has suggested is that because the testicles are genetically the part of the body that adapts fastest to environmental pressure, it\u2019s quite possible that our testicles are much smaller than they were as recently as fifteen or twenty thousand years ago, to reflect the historical cultural imposition of monogamy. And of course we all know that sperm count is dropping precipitously even as we speak. \n \n But that drop in sperm count has been reported over the last few decades, and I don't think American culture has becoming less sexualized since the 1950s \u2014 I think the opposite is true. \n \n Well, it\u2019s hard to say because it\u2019s only been measured for about the last 100 years. So it\u2019s very difficult to know what was happening before that. But yeah, it does seem to be plummeting faster and faster, and there are indications that it has a lot to do with industrial contaminants in the environment, and antibiotics and growth hormones in the food supply and so on. \n \n But I think there\u2019s this bifurcation of American culture where you\u2019ve got the liberalization on one side with states passing gay marriage, but then you have other states veering off in the other direction. I think the Bill Clinton and Lewinsky situation could have been such a great opportunity for the culture to grow up instead of wasting so much time and money and political capital in this investigation of a victimless crime. If the Clintons had gone on their \"60 Minutes\" interview and just said, \"You know what, our sex life is nobody\u2019s business but ours,\" I think the country would have been so much better off. \n \n I think from a cultural standpoint the idea of strict monogamy has far less currency within the gay male world than it does within the straight world. I\u2019m a gay man, and I think probably about half the gay male couples I know are in open relationships. Why do you think that is? \n \n First of all, they\u2019re both men, so they both know what it\u2019s like to be a man. They both know from experience that love and sex are two very different things, and it seems that for women the experience of sexuality is much more embedded in narrative, in emotion, in emotional intimacy. But also it\u2019s really hard to judge what women would be like if they hadn\u2019t been persecuted for the last five or six thousand or ten thousand years for any hint of infidelity. \n \n Gay men in the United States have also by definition gone through a process of self-examination. The whole process of coming out is a process of integrating sexuality into your life in a way that takes courage, and it\u2019s not something that happens naturally. I think gay people have an advantage because they\u2019ve already gone through a process of saying: \"Look, my sexuality is what it is. I\u2019m not ashamed of it. I\u2019m going to live openly and in accord with it.\" That puts them on a different level than most heterosexual people who are able to pass along and pretend that they fit into the normal parameters. \n \n It seems like many Americans, in particular, have a very strong notion that a marriage must remain monogamous at all costs \u2014 and that any infidelity is grounds for divorce. In other countries, like France, for example, that doesn't seem to be the case. \n \n I\u2019ve been living off and on for almost 20 years here in Barcelona, and from outside, the United States looks very adolescent, in a positive and negative sense. There's its adolescent energy \u2014 its idealism \u2014 but there\u2019s also an immaturity and intolerance toward the ambiguity of life and the complexity of relationships. The American sense of relationships and sexuality tends to be very informed by Hollywood: It\u2019s all about the love story. But the love story ends at the wedding and doesn't go into the 40 years that comes after that. \n \n So if monogamous marriage isn't the right arrangement for us, what is? \n \n We\u2019re not really arguing for any particular arrangement. We don\u2019t even really know what to do with this information ourselves. What we\u2019re trying to do in the book is give people a more accurate sense of where we came from, why we are the way we are, and why certain aspects of life feel like a bad fit. I think a lot of people make a commitment when they\u2019re in love, which is a sort of a delusional state that lasts a couple of years at most. I think it was Goethe who said that love is an unreal thing, and marriage is a real thing, and any confusion of the real with the unreal always leads to disaster. \n \n All we\u2019re really hoping for is to encourage more tolerance and more open discussion between men and women about sexuality and about marriage, and to come to see that marriage isn\u2019t about sex. It's about things that are much deeper and more lasting than sex, especially if you have children. And the American insistence on mixing love and sex and expecting passion to last forever is leading to great suffering that we think is tragic and unnecessary.",

Hockett, a professor at Cornell Law School. \n \n \u201cThey look pretty bad,\u201d Hockett said in an interview. \u201cThey look like the strategy has blown up in their faces.\u201d \n \n Cote ordered the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which filed the case, to propose how much the banks should pay as a result of her ruling. \n \n \u2018Consistently Candid\u2019 \n \n \u201cNomura is confident that it was consistently candid, transparent and professional in all of its dealings with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,\u201d Jonathan Hodgkinson, a U.S.-based spokesman for the bank, said in an e-mailed statement. Nomura will appeal, he said. \n \n Linda Harper, a U.K.-based spokeswoman for RBS, declined to comment on the decision. \n \n FHFA is pleased with the ruling and \u201clooks forward to submitting proposed damages,\u201d the agency\u2019s general counsel, Alfred M. Pollard, said in an e-mailed statement. \n \n Nomura Shares \n \n Shares of Nomura fell 2 percent, the most among companies on the Topix index of securities firms, to 787.9 yen at the close of trading in Tokyo, paring this year\u2019s gain to 14 percent. \n \n \u201cThe drop may be due to profit-taking by short-term investors,\u201d said Mitsushige Akino, executive officer at Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. \u201cThe lawsuit could be the catalyst, although the impact won\u2019t last long because this has been expected.\u201d \n \n Legal costs are hampering Nomura\u2019s efforts to return its overseas operations to profit. The Japanese firm had a fifth straight annual loss in its businesses abroad in the year ended March as it set aside an unspecified sum for lawsuits in the fourth quarter, financial results showed last month. \n \n Cote rejected the banks\u2019 claim that the housing crash, and not defects in the loans, was responsible for the collapse of the mortgage-backed securities. \n \n David Reiss, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, called Cote\u2019s ruling \u201cincredibly thorough.\u201d The judge included detailed factual rulings that may make it difficult for Nomura and RBS to win on appeal, he said. \n \n \u2018Danger Batman!!\u2019 \n \n The U.S. presented evidence from Nomura executives\u2019 e-mails that suggested the bank might be aware it was selling troubled mortgage-backed securities. One e-mail described some of its mortgages as \u201ccrap.\u201d \n \n Another warned: \u201cDanger Batman!!\u201d \n \n \u201cThe reason for Nomura\u2019s lackluster due diligence program is not hard to find,\u201d Cote said. The bank, competing to buy and securitize loans, sought to foster a \u201cgood relationship\u201d with mortgage lenders and ignored \u201cspecific warnings about the risk of working with an originator,\u201d she said. \n \n The banks may use a series of rulings against them by Cote, before and during trial, as issues on appeal, lawyers said. \n \n The judge barred Nomura from presenting some evidence, including limiting the bank\u2019s ability to prove its claim that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac didn\u2019t suffer damages from buying the mortgage-backed bonds. The judge also ruled that FHFA didn\u2019t have to prove Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac knew of Nomura\u2019s alleged false statements. \n \n \u2018Expressed Skepticism\u2019 \n \n Elliott Stein, a Bloomberg Intelligence litigation analyst, wrote that Cote \u201cexpressed skepticism about some of Nomura\u2019s contentions and little to none about the FHFA\u2019s case\u201d in closing arguments April 9. \n \n The FHFA claimed Tokyo-based Nomura cheated Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by selling them $2 billion of bonds backed by faulty mortgages. RBS underwrote four of the seven securitizations at issue in the trial. \n \n Nomura and RBS argued that the documents issued in connection with bond sales adequately disclosed the risks and weren\u2019t misleading. The banks also said that any alleged misstatements didn\u2019t factor into decisions by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy the securities. \n \n Most of the trial testimony came from experts reviewing Nomura\u2019s diligence in packaging mortgages into securities and disclosures it made to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in sales from 2005 to 2007. \n \n \u201cThis case is complex from almost any angle, but at its core there is a single simple question,\u201d Cote wrote. \u201cDid defendants accurately describe the home mortgages in the offering documents for the securities they sold that were backed by those mortgages?\u201d \n \n \u2018Disturbing Examples\u2019 \n \n In concluding they didn\u2019t, Cote cited what she called \u201cdisturbing examples\u201d from Nomura\u2019s files showing it was willing to securitize defective loans. \n \n In at least 184 of 672 sample loans that were reviewed, home values were inflated and appraisers didn\u2019t believe the figures they provided were correct, Cote said. \n \n The FHFA also proved that from 45 percent to 59 percent of the loans backing the mortgage securities had underwriting defects that increased their credit risk. \n \n \u201cGuidelines were systematically disregarded,\u201d she said. \n \n Edinburgh-based RBS was sued separately by FHFA in federal court in Connecticut for selling $32 billion of its own mortgage-backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That case is scheduled for trial next year. \n \n The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Nomura Holding America Inc., 11-cv-06201, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). ||||| \u201cAs its witnesses repeatedly described and as its documents illustrated, Nomura\u2019s goal was to work with the sellers of loans and to do what it could to foster a good relationship with them,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cGiven this attitude, it is unsurprising that even when there were specific warnings about the risk of working with an originator, those warnings fell on deaf ears.\u201d \n \n During the trial, expert witnesses performed analyses of some of the loans backing the disputed bonds. The experts brought in by the housing finance agency said far more of the loans than the documents stated had characteristics that made them much more likely to default. \n \n Lawyers for Nomura and R.B.S. argued that those experts\u2019 analyses were seriously flawed. In his closing argument last month, David B. Tulchin, a lawyer for Sullivan & Cromwell, representing Nomura, called the experts\u2019 methodologies \u201centirely artificial in the extreme.\u201d \n \n The banks\u2019 lawyers could argue on appeal that even though Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac took steep paper losses on the bonds, their actual losses have been small. All payments on the roughly $2 billion in bonds have been made, except for about $25 million, according a member of Nomura\u2019s legal team, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \n \n More broadly, Nomura, in its appeal, will most likely continue to argue that the government\u2019s losses on mortgage bonds were caused by the wider housing crash, making it a legal stretch to tie the losses on those bonds to flaws in the underlying loans. \n \n Judge Cote, however, said that the banks\u2019 misconduct exacerbated the collapse in the mortgage market. \n \n \u201cThe origination and securitization of these defective loans not only contributed to the collapse of the housing market, the very macroeconomic factor that defendants say caused the losses,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut once that collapse started, improperly underwritten loans were hit hardest and drove the collapse even further.\u201d ||||| NEW YORK A U.S. judge on Monday ruled that Nomura Holdings Inc (8604.T) made false statements in selling mortgage-backed securities to Fannie Mae (FNMA.OB) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.OB) ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. \n \n U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan ruled for the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the conservator for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in a ruling that could allow the U.S. regulator to recover around $450 million. \n \n Cote, who presided over a non-jury trial, said the FHFA was entitled to judgment against Nomura and the Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS.L), which underwrote some of the $2 billion in mortgage-backed securities, in light of misstatements they made in offering documents. \n \n \"The offering documents did not correctly describe the mortgage loans,\" the judge wrote in a 361-page decision. \"The magnitude of falsity, conservatively measured, is enormous.\" \n \n The exact amount of damages to be awarded was unclear. Cote ordered the FHFA to submit a proposed judgment with updated damages figures based on her ruling by Friday. \n \n But Cote, citing figures previously submitted, said the FHFA was entitled to $624.4 million, minus over $178 million in payments it received since launching the lawsuit in 2011. \n \n The FHFA, which has acted as conservator for Fannie and Freddie since the government took them over in 2008, welcomed the ruling, which nonetheless appeared to deliver less than the $1 billion it sought at trial. \n \n \"It is clear the court found that the facts presented by FHFA were convincing,\" FHFA General Counsel Alfred Pollard said in a statement. \n \n Tokyo-based Nomura said in a statement that it plans to appeal, saying it was \"confident that it was consistently candid, transparent and professional in all of its dealings with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\" \n \n A spokeswoman for RBS declined comment. \n \n The lawsuit was the first to reach trial out of 18 the regulator filed in 2011 over some $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities that various banks sold Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \n \n The FHFA previously obtained nearly $17.9 billion in settlements with banks including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE). Those deals followed a series of adverse rulings by Cote. \n \n The seven deals at issue in Nomura's case were issued from 2005 to 2007. Nomura was the securities' sponsor, and RBS underwrote four of the deals. \n \n In her ruling, Cote said the securities sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \"were supported by loans for which the underwriting process had failed,\" with deals comprised of 45 percent to 59 percent \"materially defective\" mortgages. \n \n Nomura's lawyers countered that any losses incurred by Fannie and Freddie were not the banks' fault and were due to overall market conditions. \n \n But Cote said the banks \"have not quantified the loss that they say is due to macroeconomic factors.\" \n \n Nor did the banks deny that \"there is a link between the securitization frenzy associated with those shoddy practices and the very macroeconomic factors that they say caused the losses to the certificates,\" she wrote. \n \n The case is Federal Housing Finance Agency v Nomura Holding America Inc, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-06201. \n \n (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Alan Crosby and Christian Plumb)",

    "document": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Colonel Gaddafi told the BBC that the protesters are members of al Qaeda \n \n Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi has told the BBC he is loved by all his people and has denied there have been any protests in Tripoli. \n \n Col Gaddafi said that his people would die to protect him. \n \n He laughed at the suggestion he would leave Libya and said that he felt betrayed by the world leaders who had urged him to quit. \n \n US ambassador to the UN Susan Rice said the interview showed Col Gaddafi was \"delusional\" and \"unfit to lead\". \n \n World foreign ministers earlier condemned attacks on Libyan civilians and the European Union imposed sanctions including an arms embargo, asset freeze and travel ban on Col Gaddafi and his close entourage. \n \n Col Gaddafi is facing a massive challenge to his 41-year rule, with protesters in control of towns in the east. \n \n 'Mercenaries and thugs' \n \n Col Gaddafi was speaking in an interview in Tripoli with BBC Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen, US TV network ABC, and the UK's Sunday Times newspaper. \n \n Col Gaddafi accused Western countries of abandoning Libya and said that they had no morals and wanted to colonise the country. \n \n At the scene Colonel Gaddafi did not look like a man under pressure during the interview in a restaurant overlooking Tripoli's port. He was in a fairly relaxed mood throughout, looking as if he was relishing the biggest challenge he has had in almost 42 years as Libya's leader. Asked if he would follow the advice of Western leaders to quit, he said he no official position to give up. Foreigners didn't understand the Libyan system, Colonel Gaddafi said, claiming that power was already in the hands of the people. He had harsh words for the Western leaders who have been part of Libya's rapprochement with the outside world in recent years. He said he felt betrayed. The West, he said, wanted to recolonise Libya - and that was why it had been singled out. Excerpts: Gaddafi interview \n \n When asked whether he would resign, he said he could not step down as he did not have an official position and insisted that the power was with the people. \n \n Col Gaddafi challenged those, including UK Prime Minister David Cameron, who have accused him of having money abroad, to produce evidence. \n \n He said he would \"put two fingers in their eye\". \n \n Col Gaddafi said true Libyans had not demonstrated but those who had come on to the streets were under the influence of drugs supplied by al-Qaeda. \n \n He said those people had seized weapons and that his supporters were under orders not to shoot back. \n \n Ms Rice said Col Gaddafi was \"frankly delusional\". \n \n \"When he can laugh in talking to... journalists while he is slaughtering his own people, it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality,\" she said. \n \n Earlier, foreign ministers who had gathered at a UN human rights conference in Geneva called for Col Gaddafi to go. \n \n US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton accused Col Gaddafi and his followers of using \"mercenaries and thugs\" to attack unarmed civilians, and of executing soldiers who refused to turn their guns on fellow citizens. \n \n \"It is time for Gaddafi to go, now, without further violence or delay,\" she said. \n \n Mrs Clinton also said that although US naval vessels were being repositioned near Libya there was no military action pending. \n \n When asked whether the US would back Col Gaddafi going into exile, Mrs Clinton said: \"If violence could be ended by his leaving... it might be a good step but we believe accountability must be obtained for what he has done.\" \n \n The US Treasury said it had blocked $30bn (\u00a318.5bn) in Libyan assets - the largest sum it had ever frozen. \n \n US President Barack Obama met UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the White House on Monday and both expressed concern at the rising violence and called for a legitimately elected president. \n \n Mr Ban said of Col Gaddafi: \"He lost legitimacy when he declared war on his people.\" \n \n 'Blood of martyrs' \n \n Although protesters have secured towns in the east, Col Gaddafi shows no signs of giving up in and around Tripoli. \n \n In Tajoura, a suburb of the capital, about 400 people protested against him on Monday, chanting: \"The blood of martyrs won't go to waste.\" Gaddafi supporters have reportedly tried to break up the protest by firing into the air. \n \n Reporters say there have been long queues at banks in the capital as people tried to collect the 500 dinars ($410) promised to all families by the government in an attempt to quell the unrest. \n \n There has been fighting in the coastal town of Misrata, 200km (125 miles) east of Tripoli, with Col Gaddafi's opponents repelling a government counter-attack. \n \n Anti-government forces still control Zawiya, 50km west of Tripoli, but pro-Gaddafi forces are surrounding the city. One resident told Reuters: \"We are expecting attacks at any moment... They are in large numbers.\" \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Jim Muir says volunteers are helping to provide food and drink to those who manage to cross Libya's border with Tunisia \n \n Libyan air force planes also reportedly attacked ammunition depots in the eastern towns of Ajdabiya and Rajma. \n \n Deputy foreign minister Khaled Kaim said the authorities would attempt to talk to protesters in the east, but added: \"If all attempts and efforts for dialogue... are exhausted, a very well guided force will be used in accordance with international rules.\" \n \n About 100,000 people have fled anti-government unrest in Libya over the past week, the UN estimates. \n \n The exodus of Egyptian workers from western Libya began on Wednesday, but has since been intensifying, says the BBC's Jim Muir at the Ras Ajdir border crossing with Tunisia. About 1,000 people an hour are crossing into Tunisia, he says. ||||| I interviewed Col. Moammar Gadhafi this evening, when he told me he could not step down because he is not a president or king, and denied there were demonstrations against him anywhere in Libya. \n \n \"They love me. All my people with me, they love me,\" he said. \"They will die to protect me, my people.\" \n \n We conducted the interview at a beachfront restaurant in the Corniche, a coastal road on Tripoli's Mediterranean coast. Dressed in his flowing trademark robes and gold-rimmed aviator sunglasses, Gadhafi looked every inch the flamboyant character he's known to be. The longtime leader, who didn't seem to be surrounded by huge amounts of security, seemed relaxed and focused. Walking unabashedly into the restaurant, Gadhafi wanted to show he's not hiding in any underground bunker and that he believes he's still very much in charge. \n \n Play \n \n Gadhafi said he wanted to speak to the press to get the truth out, and he spent more than an hour with us trying to put forth his side of the story. \n \n The Libyan leader laughed when I asked him whether he would step down in response to calls against violence by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Obama. \n \n \"Would anyone leave his homeland? Why would I leave Libya?\" Gadhafi said, laughing. \n \n He invited the United Nations and any other organization to come to Libya and do a \"fact finding mission\" and questioned how they could freeze assets, impose sanctions and an arms embargo, and implement a travel ban based purely on media reports alone. \n \n The current uprising is the most serious challenge posed to Gadhafi's leadership since he came to power in 1969. The 11-day revolt has turned the international community against Gadhafi and spurred the United Nations to impose new sanctions against him. \n \n Just today, a funeral for one of the protesters killed last week in Tripoli turned into a small anti-Gadhafi rally. At Tripoli's central hospital, a doctor confirmed that he received the bodies of nine people shot to death during protests. \n \n But Gadhafi's version of the truth seemed to be at odds with what people have been talking about and reporting here, and he does not seem to fully comprehend the drama and the magnitude of what's going on around him. \n \n He said he would not be leaving Libya, and denied -- in very strong terms -- using any force against his people. I asked him several times about reports that aerial bombardments had been used against protesters, but Gadhafi said they did not happen and that they had only bombed military and ammunition depots. \n \n He seemed to be in complete denial about the protests against him, and that other big cities in Libya, particularly those in the east, had been taken by his opponents. \n \n He simply rejected the notion that any walls were closing in on him. He denied he was besieged in the capital and said he would survive the current situation. \n \n Gadhafi reiterated his mantra, saying he's not president and he's not in a formal position. Libya is ruled by the people, and he is one of the people, he told ABC News. \n \n Gadhafi instead blamed al Qaeda for encouraging young people to seize arms from military installations. \n \n He said the people who have taken over Benghazi in eastern Libya are terrorists and al Qaeda operatives. He doesn't believe people are demonstrating against him anywhere in Libya, and repeated the charge that those who are have been given hallucinogenic drugs -- a claim he first made in his televised speech broadcast last week. \n \n Though he spoke mostly in Arabic, at times he became passionate and broke into excited English. \n \n When I asked him about international fears that he might use chemical weapons or launch a scorched-earth campaign against vital oil supplies, Gadhafi responded with laughter. \n \n \"We solved all these WMD issues with the U.S. and Britain years ago. It's not reasonable to use against your enemy, let alone your own people,\" he responded. \"The terrorists will try. At night, they try and go into the oil fields.\" \n \n Gadhafi, who has ruled Libya for 41 years, said he felt betrayed by the United States. \n \n \"I'm surprised that we have an alliance with the West to fight al Qaeda, and now that we are fighting terrorists they have abandoned us,\" he said. \"Perhaps they want to occupy Libya.\" \n \n Libya gave up its weapons of mass destruction in 2003, after the invasion of Iraq, and the United States lifted sanctions and restarted business relations with Libya. \n \n In 2008, then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited Libya, marking the first such visit for an official of her position since 1953, and in 2009, Gadhafi visited the United States. \n \n Libya's longtime dictator called Obama a \"good man\" but said he might have been given \"misinformation.\" \n \n \"The statements I have heard from him must have come from someone else,\" Gadhafi said. \"America is not the international police of the world.\" \n \n U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice called Gadhafi's assertion that the Libyan people are behind him \"delusional.\" \n \n \"When he can laugh in talking to American and international journalists while he is slaughtering his own people, it only underscores how unfit he is to lead and how disconnected he is from reality,\" Rice said. \n \n ABC conducted the interview with two other reporters from the BBC and the Sunday Times of London. \n \n Read Christiane Amanpour's earlier reporter's notebook from Libya here. \n \n Follow Christiane Amanpour on Facebook and Twitter.",

    "document": "Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase on Tuesday announced a partnership to cut health-care costs and improve services for their U.S. employees. The announcement slammed the shares of multiple companies in the health-care sector. \n \n The giant companies, which together employ more than 1.1 million workers, will launch an independent operation that's intended to be free from profit-making incentives. \n \n The new company's goal at first will be to target technology solutions to simplify the health-care system. \n \n Details of the new company were sketchy, with principals of Amazon, Berkshire and J.P. Morgan noting that the way it will work remains to be seen. They're hoping that their sheer size will help bring the necessary scale and resources to tackle the issue. \n \n \"The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,\" Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett said in a statement. \"Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable. Rather, we share the belief that putting our collective resources behind the country's best talent can, in time, check the rise in health costs while concurrently enhancing patient satisfaction and outcomes.\" \n \n The announcement makes sense of Amazon's early moves in health care over the last year. It speaks to the desire to rip apart the traditional health-care system from distinctive silos. Experts have anticipated more deals and vertical integration in wake of CVS announcing its intention to buy Aetna. \n \n Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting, said it's \"long past time\" for employers like these three to force innovation into the health-care system. \n \n \"For better or worse, there are warped incentives baked into every aspect of the U.S. health-care system, from medical innovation to care delivery to insurance and benefit management,\" Fein told CNBC. \"Rather than merely bashing the current system, I hope this new organization can help patients and their physicians make more informed and more cost-effective decisions. Technology will be necessary but not sufficient to make positive changes.\" \n \n Analysts echoed the sentiment that the health-care system is outdated and ripe for disruption, paving the way for the new endeavor. However, they cautioned it could take time. Some experts are skeptical the three companies can meaningfully lower costs and improve outcomes. \n \n \"If this winds up being the low cost provider to make insurance more affordable at employer level, it could wind up being a real disruptive competitor to an industry that has not seen any new players in years/decades,\" Jefferies analyst Jared Holz told CNBC. \"[I'm] not going to call this black swan event yet because there are few details and would be making too many assumptions but it has potential to be.\" \n \n J.P. Morgan currently uses Cigna and UnitedHealth Group to administer health benefits on a self-insured basis and Amazon uses nonprofit Premera Blue Cross, according to Evercore analysts. Amazon uses ExpressScripts as its pharmacy benefits manager, said Leerink Partners' Ana Gupte. \n \n Shares of Berkshire and J.P. Morgan fell slightly, while Amazon edged higher. \n \n However, shares of health-care companies fell sharply. Express Scripts and Aetna sank 3 percent; Cigna slid percent while CVS and UnitedHealth fell 4 percent. \n \n \"Today's announcement by Amazon, J.P. Morgan & Chase company, and Berkshire Hathaway is clear recognition that the healthcare system needs to continue to create and deliver meaningful value to payors and patients,\" Express Scripts said in a statement.\"...We look forward to hearing more about this new initiative and how we can work together to improve health care for everyone.\" \n \n Amazon in particular can play a strong role if it promotes a greater presence for technological advances including artificial intelligence and information sharing platforms into health care, said Idris Adjerid, management information technology professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. \n \n \"We find that technology initiatives which facilitated information sharing between disconnected hospitals resulted in significant reductions in healthcare spending,\" Adjerid said in a statement. \"That said, it is unclear what the scope of this effort will be. If this partnership is to meaningfully improve healthcare delivery, it needs to include more than the employees of these companies.\" \n \n The announcement was light on details but said three top executives, one from each company, will take the lead on the project: Berkshire investment officer Todd Combs, J.P. Morgan's Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold and Beth Galetti, a senior vice president at Amazon. \n \n Combs was a hedge fund manager before joining Berkshire in 2010. Berchtold was previously global head of mergers and acquisitions at drugmaker Novartis before joining J.P. Morgan last year, and Galetti was FedEx's vice president for planning, engineering and operations before joining Amazon in 2013, according to their LinkedIn profiles. \n \n \"The healthcare system is complex, and we enter into this challenge open-eyed about the degree of difficulty,\" said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. \"Hard as it might be, reducing healthcare's burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort.\" \n \n \n \n \"Our people want transparency, knowledge and control when it comes to managing their healthcare,\" said J.P. Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon. \"The three of our companies have extraordinary resources, and our goal is to create solutions that benefit our U.S. employees, their families and, potentially, all Americans.\" \n \n Here's the full press release: \n \n Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A, BRK.B) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today that they are partnering on ways to address healthcare for their U.S. employees, with the aim of improving employee satisfaction and reducing costs. The three companies, which bring their scale and complementary expertise to this long-term effort, will pursue this objective through an independent company that is free from profit-making incentives and constraints. The initial focus of the new company will be on technology solutions that will provide U.S. employees and their families with simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost. Tackling the enormous challenges of healthcare and harnessing its full benefits are among the greatest issues facing society today. By bringing together three of the world's leading organizations into this new and innovative construct, the group hopes to draw on its combined capabilities and resources to take a fresh approach to these critical matters. \"The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy.

    "document": "Actor George Takei took to his Facebook page Thursday night to explain what he meant by calling Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas a \u201cclown in blackface,\u201d saying the term was \u201ctheater lingo\u201d that \u201cis not racist.\u201d \n \n A few fans have written wondering whether I intended to utter a racist remark by referring to Justice Thomas as a \u201cclown in blackface.\u201d \u201cBlackface\u201d is a lesser known theatrical term for a white actor who blackens his face to play a black buffoon. In traditional theater lingo, and in my view and intent, that is not racist. It is instead part of a racist history in this country. I feel Justice Thomas has abdicated and abandoned his African American heritage by claiming slavery did not strip dignity from human beings. He made a similar remark about the Japanese American internment, of which I am a survivor. A sitting Justice of the Supreme Court ought to know better. I have expressed my full thoughts on the matter here. \n \n A few thoughts from one of Takei\u2019s (former) fans. \n \n 1. No, no one cared if you \u201cintended to utter a racist remark.\u201d They cared that you uttered a racist remark. The outrage stemmed not from the fact that you intended to be racist, but that you seem so utterly clueless that what you were saying was unacceptable. \n \n 2. Blackface is a \u201clesser known theatrical term\u201d? Don\u2019t be condescending. The people who took offense to your comments knew exactly what blackface is, and the entire ugly racist history behind it. On the contrary, you sound like the ignorant one for seriously trying to downplay that ugly history as just some cute theater factoid. \n \n 3. So blackface \u201cis not racist,\u201d but \u201cis instead part of a racist history in this country.\u201d I\u2026 I won\u2019t even respond to this because it\u2019s literally nonsense. I honestly don\u2019t even know what he\u2019s getting at. \n \n 4. \u201cI feel Justice Thomas has abdicated and abandoned his African American heritage\u2026\u201d Let\u2019s pause you right there. Who in God\u2019s name are you that you have the right to tell someone that they have abandoned their entire race? It\u2019s bad enough when conservatives of color get this from people of their own race, but now it\u2019s apparently a racial elimination free-for-all. \n \n And what kind of screwed up person believes that someone abandons their entire race because of their politics anyways? What sort of discourse will this country have when people are told that unless they toe the line on certain beliefs, they will be considered traitors to their race and Hollywood actors can shame them without facing any sort of retribution at all? \n \n Of course, I suspect that if someone tried to erase George Takei\u2019s entire racial (or sexual) identity in retaliation for an unpopular view he held, he\u2019d have a slightly different take on the matter. \n \n 5. \u201c\u2026by claiming slavery did not strip dignity from human beings. He made a similar remark about the Japanese American internment, of which I am a survivor.\u201d Takei had several hours to look up and read Thomas\u2019 dissent to know that he was intentionally taken out of context. Many, many people pointed out that he was wrong. At this point, his stubbornness can only be chalked up to intentional blindness. \n \n For God\u2019s sake, Clarence Thomas was born in the rural Jim Crow South. He understands what it\u2019s like to live under the thumb of a racist, oppressive government. Did anyone outside of the most hateful partisans really believe that he\u2019s some sort of slavery apologist, and that he was open about that fact in the most widely read legal opinion for decades? \n \n But apparently Thomas\u2019 experiences with racism don\u2019t mean squat, because some actor who scored one significant role and coasted for fifty years ago thinks he isn\u2019t black anymore. And worse yet, judging by the complete silence from nearly everyone on the in Hollywood and on the left side of the aisle, a lot people have no problem with that*. \n \n *Shout-out to Marc Lamont Hill, whose been one of the few liberals to date to loudly and publicly condemn Takei. \n \n [Image via screenshot] \n \n \u2014\u2014 \n \n >>Follow Alex Griswold (@HashtagGriswold) on Twitter \n \n Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com",

This time, he's the one catching flak from critics.

    "document": "CLOSE Brevard Hall of Fame wants the remains of Jim Morrison in Melbourne. Video by Craig Rubadoux. Posted Dec. 30, 2015. \n \n Jim Morrison of The Doors died in July 1971 of an alleged heroin overdose in Paris. (Photo: Pensacola News Journal) \n \n MELBOURNE \u2014 The president of the Brevard Hall of Fame wants to move Jim Morrison's remains from his Paris gravesite to Melbourne, the birthplace of the controversial, magnetic \"Lizard King\" lead singer of The Doors. \n \n One of the most iconic frontmen in rock history, Morrison was born Dec. 8, 1943, at the former Brevard Hospital on U.S. 1. His parents, Steve and Clara, moved to town when Steve was transferred to Naval Air Station Melbourne for flight training during World War II, and they lived in a downtown home on Vernon Place. \n \n Though Morrison's resting place is a heavily visited pop-culture shrine listed among TIME's Top 10 Celebrity Grave Sites \u2014 alongside the likes of Princess Diana, Elvis Presley and Bruce Lee \u2014 scant evidence exists in Melbourne of his local ties. \n \n John Tice wants to change that. In August 2012, he founded the Brevard Hall of Fame, a nonprofit organization that occupies a back room inside the Liberty Bell Memorial Museum and honors more than 30 famous people with Space Coast residential ties. A modest Morrison display features posters, two record albums by The Doors (\"13\" and \"Strange Days\"), and a framed copy of his last will and testament. \n \n \"Jim Morrison was the most popular public figure from this area, in my opinion,\" Tice said, seated at a table inside the hall of fame. \"He and Kate Upton are the two biggest draws here.\" \n \n \"I can see the Morrison display morphing into something much bigger,\" he said. \n \n Tice, who is a West Melbourne city councilman, hopes to contact authorities at the sprawling P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, where Morrison was interred after his 1971 death. If cemetery officials agree, and any potential legal issues are ironed out, Tice plans to organize a fundraising drive to move Morrison's remains to Melbourne for display at the Brevard Hall of Fame. \n \n A couple of years ago, Tice said he heard that French cemetery officials offered to move Morrison\u2019s remains to Melbourne to his Vernon Place birth home. However, the homeowner declined the offer. \n \n Today, Jim Morrison's display serves as the centerpiece of the Brevard Hall of Fame main wall, near a football autographed by NFL quarterback Doug Flutie of Melbourne Beach, a surfboard autographed by 11-time world champion Kelly Slater of Cocoa Beach, and both of Upton's Sports Illustrated swimsuit-issue covers. The supermodel, who was crowned People's Sexiest Woman Alive last year, attended Melbourne's Holy Trinity Episcopal Academy. \n \n Two Morrison posters and a \"Jim Morrison Way\" replica street sign were donated by Applebee\u2019s at Wickham Road and Eau Gallie Boulevard, where they had been displayed in the dining room. Last year, an Ohio fan of The Doors donated both records and the poetry book \u201cWilderness: The Lost Writings of Jim Morrison.\u201d \n \n The newest Brevard Hall of Fame inductee is pro wrestler \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan, a former Titusville resident and member of the WWE Hall of Fame.

Everybody knows that Jim Morrison was born in Melbourne, Florida,\" said John Tice, Brevard Hall of Fame President. \n \n Tice said that he received word that officials in Paris were interested in returning Morrison's remains to the states after contacting the owner of Morrison's childhood home. \n \n \"The officials that own the cemetery in Paris offered his remains according to the owner of the house on Vernon street to bring him there,\" said Tice. \"I talked to him real recent because I heard he reconsidered and he said no he's not going to do it. So I said well give me the contact information and I'd like to see what I can do.\" \n \n Morrison left the United States for Paris after an arrest warrant was issued for him out of Miami for indecent exposure during a concert. \n \n Tice said not everyone in Brevard County would support Morrison's possible return. \n \n \"I think it's going to be mixed reviews. I think some people will say, 'I can't wait.' I think other people will say, 'Shame on you,'\" said Tice. \n \n Tice said that it is his understanding that the lease for Morrison's grave site is almost up, and officials in Paris are concerned about vandalism near his memorial. \n \n \"If he can't be where he's at which is where he passed away, then I think he ought to be where he was born because where else would be better than that?\" \n \n Tice is still waiting to hear back from officials in Paris. \n \n Copyright 2015 by WKMG ClickOrlando - All rights reserved.",

John Tice, a city councilman in Melbourne, Brevard County, operates the Brevard Hall of Fame and he tells Florida Today that he plans to talk to officials in Paris about bringing Morrison's remains back to the US. Morrison \"was the most popular public figure from this area, in my opinion,\" Tice says, adding that he \"can see the Morrison display morphing into something much bigger.\" Tice plans to hold a fundraising drive if he gets permission to move the remains from the city where Morrison died in 1971. Tice tells WKMG that he's waiting to hear from officials that he contacted after hearing that the lease on Morrison's Paris grave may be up soon. He says he expects controversy if the singer, who was born in Brevard Hospital 72 years ago, is moved to Melbourne. \"I think it's going to be mixed reviews,\" he says. \"I think some people will say, 'I can't wait.' I think other people will say, 'Shame on you.'\" Florida Today notes that Morrison didn't linger in Melbourne for long: Baby Jim and his mother moved elsewhere in Florida after six months when his father, a Navy pilot who later became an admiral, graduated flight training and left to serve in the Pacific theater of World War II.

It's not just the sound of crickets you hear watching this movie. It's the sound of dead crickets. \n \n Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker play the Morgans, a Manhattan power couple on the outs and the brink of divorce. He cheated on her, citing reasons of infertility-related stress; she is not in the forgiving vein and has already begun thinking about adoption on her own.

Running time: 1 43 ||||| Jeff Bridges and his Crazy Heart \n \n Under the Eightball \n \n GO CRAZY HEART Yesterday\u2019s honky-tonk hero, Bad Blake, arrives at a Clovis, New Mexico, bowling alley. It\u2019s another in a string of low-paying, low-turnout gigs with pickup bands half his age, grinding the Greatest Hits out of an old Fender Tremolux, including his breakout \u2014 with the chorus, \u201cFunny how falling feels like flying ... for a little while.\u201d Bad\u2019s not flying these days; he\u2019s dying slowly on a bourbon diet, holed up in motels, watching Spanish-language smut. Actor-turned-writer-director Scott Cooper adapted Crazy Heart from Thomas Cobb\u2019s 1987 novel (the title is a Hank Williams B-Side). Cobb wanted Waylon Jennings for Bad Blake; Jeff Bridges got the part, though the now-deceased Jennings and Bad\u2019s other inspirations hang over it. It\u2019s easy to forget, as Billboard\u2019s Country charts fill with faintly twangy pop and lazy paeans to dogs and trucks, that this music has an atavistic darkness. Bad has just about bottomed out when a small-time journalist, Jean (Maggie Gyllenhaal), meets him for a rare interview \u2014 and sticks around. Crazy Heart follows the slow recovery of atrophied emotional responses, which starts when Bad gets involved with Jean and her young son. The subject, rehabilitation, is old and resonant. (Says Waylon: \u201cWe\u2019ve been the same way for years/We need to change.\u201d) No scene feels obligatory, and Crazy Heart shows a pragmatic but tender understanding of the relationship between physical breakdown and the discovery of morality. It\u2019s merely a well-done, adult American movie \u2014 that is to say, a rarity. (ArcLight Hollywood; AMC Century City) \n \n GO DID YOU HEAR ABOUT THE MORGANS? Let\u2019s be honest here: Did You Hear About the Morgans? is multiplex meringue compared to the meat-and-potatoes cinema at this most award-whoring time of year. Which is fine. Better than fine, frankly, as Hugh Grant yet again proves he\u2019s the most reliable deadpan smart-ass this or that side of the Atlantic \u2014 and the actor Paul Rudd should aspire to be once he grows out of his bromantic period. Grant\u2019s Paul Morgan is a Manhattan attorney who, along with his estranged wife (Sarah Jessica Parker as New York\u2019s real estate goddess), witnesses a murder, is forced by U.S. Marshals into a relocation program, and learns how to love again. Their destination: Ray, Wyoming, where they share a log cabin with the sheriff (Sam Elliott and his mustache) and his deputy missus (Mary Steenburgen). At which point the comedy turns blue \u2014 as in, blue state versus red state, \u201creal America\u201d versus the one populated by liberal vegetarian New Yorkers and Brits who are probably real Jewish, too. While the story never strays from its formula (how will these battling Bickersons find love again after all that betrayal and ... oh, look, a bear\u2019s chasing Grant!), it\u2019s a thoroughly delightful throwaway \u2014 the kind of movie for which cable TV was made. Marc Lawrence writes and directs \u2014 as he did for Grant\u2019s Music and Lyrics \u2014 and he sure knows his way \u2019round a snappy tune. (Citywide) (Robert Wilonsky) \n \n DON\u2019T FADE AWAY was not screened in advance of our publication deadline, but a review will appear here next week and can be found online at laweekly.com/movies. (Music Hall) \n \n FALL DOWN DEAD A straightforward, old-fashioned exploitation movie, replete with the usual gratuitous sex scene featuring no-name actors, gory set pieces and some clever stunt casting, Fall Down Dead is reasonably entertaining if unexceptional. Dominique Swain is the damsel in distress, Udo Kier the art-crazy serial killer, and the late David Carradine a comic-relief security guard; if this movie receives any notoriety at all, it will likely be for the fact that Carradine\u2019s character meets his demise in a manner that\u2019s uncomfortably similar to real life. Shooting in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (which apparently has a Figueroa Street \u2014 who knew?), director John Keeyes (an Oscar nominee for the short Angela\u2019s Body, and a maker of direct-to-DVD thrillers ever since) swiftly traps us in a downtown building during rolling blackouts, as a madman with a straight razor and love of Picasso corners a group of unlikely stragglers, none of whom \u2014 not even the plainclothes cops \u2014 seems to know how to use a gun properly. An unsatisfactory ending setting up for a sequel that will never happen is the most significant sour note; otherwise, there\u2019s little here worth paying full price for or getting too upset about \u2014 unless you\u2019ve read the press kit that tries to compare this schlock to Hitchcock. (Music Hall) (Luke Y. Thompson) \n \n GO HOME The opening scenes of Home \u2014 a nighttime game of street hockey, a bathing session that turns into a five-way splash fight \u2014 establish the anarchic sense of play that defines the interactions of the film\u2019s central family, while the casual nudity on display hints at the vaguely incestuous tensions in this uniquely insular clan. The rest of Ursula Meier\u2019s confident, appealingly bizarre debut feature subjects these tensions to the hothouse environment of a self-willed isolation. When the five members of the family find their remote domestic paradise invaded by the reopening of the abandoned highway adjacent to their house, they resort to increasingly lunatic measures to block out the noise \u2014 it\u2019s but a small step from earplugs to bricking up their house entirely. Eventually, paranoia and open hostility set in as a family defined from the start by too great a sense of closeness is forced into even closer proximity. Working with all-star DP Agn\u00e8s Godard, Meier effectively communicates the sense of upended privacy, moving easily from the nighttime intrusion of brightly clad construction workers (the eye-straining oranges and yellows of their uniforms registering as a truly alien presence) to the incongruous sight of Isabelle Huppert tending her garden as blurry streaks of traffic zip by.

    "document": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A trade deal fight led by U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Saturday failed to fully materialize as rival and presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton announced a compromise to expand mandatory healthcare funding over the next decade. \n \n Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to the General Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church during their annual convention at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., July 8, 2016. REUTERS/Charles Mostoller \n \n At a meeting of the Democratic Party draft platform committee in Orlando, Florida, on Saturday, supporters of Sanders were unable to influence the committee to adopt strong language opposing the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade pact, marking a powerful blow to the efforts by the U.S. senator from Vermont to push the party further to the left. \n \n \u201cWe did everything we could to win that vote,\u201d said Sanders policy adviser Warren Gunnels. \u201cIt was very disappointing.\u201d \n \n Instead of a condemnation specific to the TPP, the committee reached language saying they would oppose \u201ctrade agreements that do not support good American jobs.\u201d \n \n Sanders has headed the effort on the U.S. left to oppose the TPP and trade deals like it, which he says are unfair to American workers. Clinton has also come out as opposed to the agreement. \n \n Despite Clinton having already secured the requisite delegates to clinch the party\u2019s nomination at the July 25-28 convention, Sanders remains in the race to be the party\u2019s nominee. \n \n He has indicated that he would hold off on endorsing Clinton for the Nov. 8 general election fight against Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump until she adopted policies and campaign language that more closely resembled his own more liberal tone. \n \n \u201cI would like to say that while this vote was disappointing, we have won some tremendous victories,\u201d Gunnels said, including securing language in the draft supporting a federal $15 minimum wage, another trademark issue for Sanders. \n \n On the same day, the Clinton campaign announced changes to its healthcare policy proposal, including increasing mandatory healthcare funding under the Affordable Care Act by $40 billion over the next 10 years, highlighting the significant influence Sanders still yields over the party. \n \n \u201cWe have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable healthcare to everyone in America,\u201d Clinton said in a statement that included her intention to give Americans the choice of a public-option insurance plan and allow for individuals below Medicare age, beginning at 55, to opt in to the U.S. federal program that pays elderly Americans\u2019 hospital bills. \n \n Sanders has made combating healthcare costs a rallying cry of his campaign and often battled with Clinton during the primary race on how best to reach their shared goal of universal healthcare. \n \n On Saturday, Sanders praised the updates to Clinton\u2019s proposal as a step in the right direction to \u201csave lives and ease suffering,\u201d indicating, along with the more liberal tone in several parts of the 2016 platform draft, a growing compromise between the two camps. \n \n For Clinton, an endorsement from Sanders - seen as a champion of the progressive left - could open the door to many of his supporters who have been reluctant to support the more moderate Clinton. \n \n \u201cThe proposal brought forth today by Secretary Clinton, working with our campaign, is an important step forward in expanding healthcare in America - and expanding health insurance and healthcare access to tens of millions of Americans,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \n Slideshow (2 Images) \n \n \u201cI congratulate Secretary Clinton for this extremely important initiative.\u201d \n \n The New York Times reported on Thursday that an endorsement is imminent, and Sanders is expected to officially throw his support behind Clinton, a former U.S. secretary of state, at a campaign stop in New Hampshire early next week. \n \n (This story corrects age at which individuals could opt in to Medicare under Clinton plan in paragraph 10) ||||| Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-V.t, right, speaks as Hillary Clinton listens during the CNN Democratic Presidential Primary Debate at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York on April 14, 2016. (Photo: Seth Wenig, AP) \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 Hillary Clinton on Saturday announced her plan to expand investments in community health care centers, the second of two proposals in a week apparently aimed at courting supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders ahead of his possible endorsement. \n \n The presumptive Democratic nominee's proposal would double funding for primary care services at Federally Qualified Health Centers, which serve populations with limited access to health care. Community health care centers have been a key priority for Sanders, I-Vt., who successfully fought for the inclusion of $11 billion in funding for such centers in the Affordable Care Act of 2010. \n \n Clinton also affirmed her commitment to giving Americans in every state the choice of a \"public-option\" insurance plan \u2014 which she supported during her 2008 presidential campaign and Sanders pushed for during the ACA debate \u2014 and allowing people below Medicare age to opt into the programby offering it to those who are 55 and older. \n \n An hour after her health care announcement, Clinton's campaign announced firm details about her Tuesday campaign event in Portsmouth, N.H., where Sanders is expected to endorse his primary campaign rival. The announcement does not mention Sanders. \n \n \"We have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable health care to everyone in America,\" Clinton said in a statement. \"Already, the Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans. As president, I will make sure Republicans never succeed in their attempts to strip away their care and that the remaining uninsured should be able to get the affordable coverage they need to stay healthy.\" \n \n Sanders, in a press call timed 15 minutes after Clinton's announcement, said the proposal by Clinton \u2014 \"working with our campaign\" \u2014 is an important step forward in expanding access to health care and addressing a crisis in primary health care. \n \n \"It will save lives, it will ease suffering, it will improve health care in America and it will cut health care costs,\" he said. \"It is a significant step forward as we advance toward the goal of health care for for all Americans.\" \n \n The announcement follows a higher education proposal Clinton released Wednesday that Sanders called a \u201cbold initiative\u201d to \u201crevolutionize the funding of higher education in America.\u201d That proposal is designed to eliminate college tuition for working families and reduce debt. \n \n Sanders was asked if he is now in a position to endorse Clinton. \n \n \"It\u2019s fair to say that the Clinton campaign and our campaign are coming closer and closer together in trying to address the major issues facing this country, which is what my campaign was all about, and we look forward to continue working with the Clinton campaign and will have more to say in the very near future,\" he said. \n \n Sanders has long called for a \"Medicare-for-all\" proposal that would grant all Americans access to health care through a single-payer national program. During the primary campaign, Clinton questioned how he'd pay for his proposal and said she wants to defend and build on the progress made by the Affordable Care Act. She accused him during a debate of wanting to \"tear (the ACA) up and start over again,\" a claim he rejected. \n \n Her proposal Saturday would extend the current mandatory funding for community health centers and expand it by $40 billion over the next 10 years. A Clinton campaign official said the proposal would be fully paid for with savings, innovations and tax reform that closes loopholes and \"makes the wealthiest pay their fair share.\" \n \n Community health centers provide care for about 25 million people in the United States, more than half of whom are Hispanic or African Americans, according to the Clinton campaign. Sanders said the centers offer savings to the overall health care system of $49 billion a year, and access to health care when people need it avoids costly illnesses, hospital stays and trips to the emergency room. \n \n \"These are good investments for patients and these are very good investments for taxpayers,\" he said. He said Clinton's efforts to provide Americans with the choice of a public-option insurance plan and to expand Medicare \"will get us closer to the day when everyone in America has access to quality, affordable health care.\u201d \n \n Clinton's announcement came on a day when Democrats in Orlando were finalizing the party platform they will bring to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia later this month. \n \n The 187-member Platform Committee voted down an amendment by a Sanders supporter that would have blocked a vote in Congress on the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed 12-nation trade pact that Sanders says will hurt U.S. workers and the environment. But they approved an amendment by a Clinton representative that, without explicitly opposing the TPP, says that Democrats will oppose trade agreements that do not support good American jobs, raise wages and improve national security. \n \n Platform language aimed at blocking the TPP was a top priority for Sanders. Warren Gunnels, Sanders' policy director, said the campaign is \"very disappointed\" that the Sanders-backed amendment failed, but he said it's \"good news\" that virtually everyone who spoke during the debate made it clear they oppose the TPP. \n \n \"Sen. Sanders, Sec. Clinton and the overwhelming majority of Democrats agree: the TPP should not come up for a vote after the election,\" Gunnels said in a statement. \"If Democrats are going to prevail in November we must make clear to the American people that we stand firmly against the TPP. We will continue fighting to protect American jobs and to ensure Congress does not pass this disastrous trade agreement.\" \n \n Sanders has said he is prepared to bring amendments to the floor of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia if the party doesn\u2019t take more progressive stances in its platform. A convention floor fight seems unlikely now, given his confirmation that he is preparing to endorse Clinton. \n \n Follow @ngaudiano on Twitter. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/29qNDpD ||||| Hillary Clinton reaffirmed her support on Saturday for creating a \u201cpublic option\u201d within Obamacare and allowing people to enroll in Medicare at age 55. \n \n The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee also called for a substantial increase in funding in medical clinics that serve low-income Americans, fully embracing a proposal from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). \n \n While Clinton has long supported the creation of new government-run insurance options and reiterated that support several times this year, Saturday\u2019s statement comes three days before she is scheduled to make her first joint campaign appearance with Sanders \u2015 who has championed government-run insurance and federally financed clinics throughout his career and during his own bid for the presidency. \n \n Sanders, who ran a surprisingly strong but ultimately unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic nomination, is expected to endorse Clinton at that Tuesday event. Saturday\u2019s announcement on health policy follows a similar one from Clinton earlier in the week, that she was enhancing her own proposal on college tuition assistance to match the considerably more generous version Sanders had sketched out. \n \n In describing the proposals to The Huffington Post, senior Clinton campaign aides noted that Sanders had championed these ideas \u2015 and, in particular, that the former Secretary of State\u2019s funding proposal for the clinics matched one that the independent senator had made. \n \n Already, the Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans. Hillary Clinton \n \n \u201cWe have more work to do to finish our long fight to provide universal, quality, affordable health care to everyone in America,\u201d Clinton said in a press release that the campaign circulated late Saturday morning. \u201cAlready, the Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage to 20 million Americans. As president, I will make sure Republicans never succeed in their attempts to strip away their care and that the remaining uninsured should be able to get the affordable coverage they need to stay healthy.\u201d \n \n Sanders said in a conference call shortly afterwards that the announcement was the product of discussion between the two campaigns. He praised Clinton\u2019s proposal in strong, unambiguous terms \u2015 describing it as \u201can extremely important initiative\u201d and predicting that \u201cit will save lives, it will ease suffering, it will improve health care in America, and it will cut health care costs.\u201d \n \n The idea of the public option \u2015 as first sketched out by Jacob Hacker, a Yale political scientist \u2015 is to create a separate, government-run insurance plan that would compete with private insurers offering coverage through the Affordable Care Act\u2019s exchanges. The hope is that this competition can help keep premiums for all the insurance plans low, particularly if the government-run plan has the ability to dictate low reimbursement rates to doctors, hospitals, drugmakers, and other suppliers of medical care. \n \n President Barack Obama and Democratic leaders included versions of the public option in their proposals when they first began working on health care reform in 2009. But they ended up jettisoning the idea in response to protests from more conservative Democrats, who were less enthusiastic about government programs and industry groups, like hospitals and insurance companies, that feared what a public option would do to their income streams. \n \n The idea of a Medicare buy-in has been around for even longer, although it, too, appeared in 2009 when Democrats were drawing up health care legislation. The goal, again, would be to give consumers \u2015 in this case, those older than 55 and at greater risk of becoming sick \u2015 one more insurance option if they can\u2019t get coverage through an employer or an existing government program. \n \n Clinton has expressed support for both ideas during the 2016 campaign, noting that she had called for them previously. (She made a public option part of her campaign proposal to reform health care in 2008.) But campaign aides said Saturday\u2019s announcement is a reminder of how seriously she takes the idea \u2015 and her determination to promote it as president. \n \n Jim Young / Reuters U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s call to increase funding for federally run health clinics is a bit more specific, in that she\u2019s put a dollar figure on it. It would be $40 billion over 10 years. \n \n That might reassure some of the progressive Sanders supporters skeptical of Clinton\u2019s commitment to their values and goals \u2015 and, in some cases, angry at her attacks on Sanders\u2019 proposal to create a single, government-run insurance plan that would provide coverage to all Americans, supplanting private insurance altogether. \n \n Of course, Clinton\u2019s announcement comes with no policy details. She isn\u2019t answering any of the many complicated questions that either proposal would raise \u2015 like exactly how either the Obamacare public option or Medicare buy-in plan would pay the providers of medical services, or exactly who could enroll in either one. \n \n Clinton\u2019s call to increase funding for federally run health clinics is a bit more specific, in that she\u2019s put a dollar figure on it. It would be $40 billion over 10 years. She hasn\u2019t identified new revenue or spending cuts to cover the cost of the proposal, but she has said that she will remain true to her pledge to pay for the price of any proposals \u2015 a pledge that she has largely kept in this campaign, independent budget analysts say. \n \n And while the clinic proposal likely to get a lot less attention than anything Clinton says about the public option of Medicare, the idea, if implemented, could help a great many people get medical care. \n \n The clinics are the backbone of the nation\u2019s health care safety net, providing primary care to millions of Americans who either have no health insurance or whose insurance doesn\u2019t meet their needs \u2015 a group that, even after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, is large and underserved. \n \n About one in 14 Americans currently gets health care through a federally funded clinic, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. That\u2019s thanks to annual funding of about $5 billion, a big chunk of which comes from a provision in the Affordable Care Act that Sanders championed. \n \n \u201cThis would be a substantial infusion of funding,\u201d Larry Levitt, senior vice president of the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, told HuffPost. \u201cMore funding for community health centers creates an infrastructure to care for increasing numbers of insured people and also provides resources to reach the remaining uninsured to encourage them to get covered.\u201d \n \n Federal clinics happen to be one of the few government-run healthcare programs with a history of strong bipartisan support. George W. Bush was a big fan during his presidency, for example. So while both a public option and Medicare buy-in would likely run into the same political opposition that stopped them in 2009,more money for clinics would have a chance of becoming law even with Republicans controlling a house of Congress. \n \n This article has been updated to include more specific details on Clinton\u2019s proposal and reactions to it.",

    "document": "Donald Trump's hopes of delivering a \"big surprise\" at the Republican National Convention are officially rained out. \n \n The real estate mogul had been excitedly promoting his scheduled contribution to this year's conservative confab, despite suggestions that his participation would simply amount to a bit where he'd fire an Obama impersonator. \n \n Tropical Storm Isaac had other plans however, as the threat of heavy rains and extreme winds forced the GOP's planning committee to postpone the RNC, shifting Monday's events and canceling others. Trump's act, slated to take place on Monday, wasn't spared the chopping block. Some Republicans are thankful, the Washington Post reports, though Trump spokesman Michael Cohen maintained that Trump's show would have been quite the spectacle. \n \n Trump was in Florida on Sunday to receive a \"statesman of the year\" award from the Sarasota GOP. At a reception dinner, he addressed the development and also continued on his birther tear. \n \n \"They gave me a big role and I was looking forward \u2013- I was actually going to Tampa right after this, right after this dinner, but now I probably will be going back to New York,\" Trump said, according to Politico. \"I may come back but I\u2019ll probably be going to New York after the dinner.\" \n \n Trump also spoke on another contribution he has provided to the political debate: His near-constant appeal to beliefs that President Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States, and that his long-form birth certificate is a forgery. Pressed by reporters on an incident last week in which GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney appeared to make a joke about the nagging conspiracy theory, Trump suggested it was no laughing matter. \n \n \"Let\u2019s just say this there\u2019s a huge group of people that are not believers in what [Obama] did, what he said and where he came from,\" Trump said, going on to explain that his birther crusade may continue. \"We\u2019ll see what happens. Well see what happens over the coming weeks and months.\" \n \n Trump also encouraged Republicans to get nasty in the upcoming election against Obama. \n \n \"I don't think the Republicans should be or can be, they can't afford to be politically correct and nice,\" he said. \"You have to fight fire with fire. And if they don't do it, they're not going to have a good result.\" \n \n Also on HuffPost: ||||| Tampa, Florida (CNN) -- Monday was supposed to be Obama-bashing day to launch the Republican National Convention, and GOP organizers showed they were not going to let something like bad weather totally derail their agenda. \n \n While the full proceedings of the first day were canceled because of Tropical Storm Issac, effectively cutting the planned four-day convention to three, Republican officials kept up their efforts to frame President Barack Obama's leadership as a failure in terms of achievement, direction and substance. \n \n Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus gaveled the convention to order at 2 p.m. ET to cheers from several hundred delegates who showed up to witness the brief session that then went into recess until Tuesday. \n \n He pointed out a digital clock in the convention hall tabulating the amount of additional national debt accrued during the proceedings, telling the delegates and journalists, \"We also wanted to draw your attention to the unprecedented fiscal recklessness of the Obama administration.\" \n \n The original schedule called for targeting Obama on the first day to set up the desired contrast with MItt Romney at the gathering that will formally nominate the former Massachusetts governor as the Republican candidate against the incumbent president in November. Despite the lost day, GOP officials said criticism of Obama's presidency would be a consistent theme throughout the week. \n \n \"What we would want to do is define what President Obama has done over the last four years, how and why he's failed, and why his leadership has really failed the American people,\" said Russ Schriefer, a strategist for Romney's campaign. \"Stagnant economy, increasing debt, you know, and more importantly, the disappointment that many Americans feel in President Obama that he just hasn't lived up to the promises of the past four years.\" \n \n Isaac could hinder GOP chance to define Romney at convention \n \n Schriefer acknowledged at the same time Monday that convention organizers were keeping a nervous eye on Tropical Storm Isaac. Forecast to reach hurricane strength, Isaac churned through the Gulf of Mexico on the same path as Hurricane Katrina, a storm that devastated New Orleans seven years ago this month. \n \n Full proceedings are now scheduled to begin Tuesday, when the convention's 2,200-plus delegates will adopt a conservative platform and endorse Romney and his running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, as the GOP ticket. Romney will arrive in Tampa on Tuesday, his campaign said. \n \n \"We are continuing to go ahead with our program with Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday,\" Schriefer said, adding that \"we're gonna make sure that we monitor the storm as it proceeds and see what happens over the next few days.\" \n \n The concern is the perception of a celebratory convention atmosphere with colorful balloons and soaring rhetoric as a hurricane slams into the Gulf Coast, evoking memories of the havoc caused by Katrina and the ensuing criticism of the Republican administration's response. \n \n Did the RNC jump the gun by delaying convention? \n \n \"Obviously, our first concern is for the people who are in the path of the storm,\" Schriefer said, describing \"a wait-and-see attitude to see what happens with the storm.\" \n \n Romney has shown no inclination to further delay the proceedings that offer his best chance to define himself to Americans who, according to polls, think Obama is more in touch with their daily lives and needs. \n \n \"Our sons are already in Tampa and they say it's terrific there, a lot of great friends,\" he told reporters in a brief exchange Monday, adding: \"We're looking forward to a great convention.\" \n \n Delegates who found themselves with an open day attended state meetings and talked about travel challenges getting to Tampa, as well as packing for a possible hurricane. \n \n \"I packed a flashlight! Never done that before,\" Cyndy Aafedt of North Dakota said. \"I even went and bought batteries before I came.\" \n \n So far, the biggest casualty of the shortened schedule has been a planned appearance by Donald Trump. The real estate mogul and outspoken conservative was going to take part on Monday, but has scheduling conflicts the rest of the week, Schriefer said. He added it was still possible that Trump would show up before the convention ends Thursday night. \n \n Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, considered a rising conservative star in the Republican Party, also will not attend because of the storm bearing down on his state. \n \n Members of the Louisiana delegation in Tampa sounded torn over being away from loved ones under possible threat. \n \n \"I think that for Louisiana people, we know that the political part of it is important, what we're here for, but it is hard to celebrate in some ways when you have your heart in a different place,\" delegate Adonica Duggen said. \n \n A more reclusive Republican backer, Nevada billionaire Sheldon Adelson, is expected to attend the convention, a source with knowledge of the plan told CNN. Adelson and his wife are expected to listen to many of the speeches, especially ones by Ann Romney on Tuesday night and Mitt Romney on Thursday night. \n \n Together, Sheldon and Miriam Adelson have given at least $36 million to various organizations and candidates this campaign season, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks the influence of money in politics. \n \n Adelson, a casino magnate and one of the nation's richest men, has told friends he is willing to spend up to $100 million this election season to make sure a Republican is elected to the White House and to support GOP congressional candidates. \n \n Such unlimited backing from private and corporate donors has helped Romney and Republicans gain a big fundraising advantage over Obama and Democrats. \n \n Has the tea party 'sold out' to the GOP? \n \n In a new ad on Monday, the liberal MoveOn.org's political wing attacked Romney for what the group claims is his focus on the rich. The 30-second spot, titled \"Stepping on the Middle Class,\" features Romney and Ryan look-alikes stepping on people dressed as typical middle-class Americans -- firefighters, students, seniors and children -- as they walk across the convention floor to accept the GOP nomination. \n \n \"The ad is aimed at conveying to voters how Romney and Ryan would raid the middle class to transfer wealth to the top 1%,\" the group said in a statement. \n \n While the CNN/ORC International Poll indicates a dead heat between Romney and Obama, the new numbers released Sunday show that likely voters believe Obama is more in touch with their needs. \n \n \"The public gives Obama a big advantage over Romney on questions on caring about people and understanding their concerns,\" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland, adding that Romney's strong points in the minds of poll respondents are his managerial skills and having a clear plan to solve the country's problems. \n \n According to the poll, 53% of likely voters say Obama cares about the needs of people, with 39% feeling the same way about Romney. Obama leads by an equal margin when it comes to being in touch with the middle class, and six in 10 say Obama is in touch with the problems facing women today, with just over three in 10 feeling the same way about Romney. \n \n Romney has a 48%-44% margin over Obama on managing the government effectively and a 6-point advantage on having a clear plan for fixing the nation's problems. Both are within the survey's margin of error. \n \n No more niceness: Obama, Romney try to rain on each other's parade \n \n \"The challenge facing Romney at the GOP convention is to build on those managerial strengths while at the same trying to convince average Americans that he is in touch with their problems. Obama's personal characteristics, for the moment, outshine Romney's,\" Holland said. \n \n On specific issues, the poll results show a similar dynamic: Obama is generally ahead on foreign policy and social issues while Romney is generally preferred on economic issues. \n \n According to the survey, likely voters prefer Obama's policies on gay and lesbian issues by 59%-33% and choose Obama over Romney on abortion by 53%-40%. The president also has a 51%-44% advantage over Romney on foreign policy and a 50%-43% margin on terrorism. \n \n The candidates were statistically even on the economy, with Romney's 50%-46% advantage within the survey's margin of error, and Romney holds a 10-point advantage on handling the federal deficit. \n \n Another new poll released Monday showed Romney and Obama neck-and-neck in Florida, a battleground state, and North Carolina, where the Democratic convention will take place next week. \n \n The CNN/Time Magazine/ORC poll had both races statistically even, with Obama's 50%-46% advantage in Florida and Romney's 48%-47% lead in North Carolina both within the margin of error. \n \n Republican organizers say the shortened convention schedule provides enough time for all the planned major speeches, though some will be shortened to fit the revised schedule. \n \n Sen. John McCain, the Republican nominee in 2008 who had the first day of his nominating convention in Minneapolis shortened because of a hurricane then threatening the Gulf Coast, agreed that losing one night is manageable. However, McCain told NBC on Sunday, \"It could be harmful if we lose more than that.\" \n \n Speakers guide to the RNC \n \n In a sign of how badly the party wants to hold the convention to showcase Romney, GOP officials have not ruled out extending it by a day to Friday if necessary, a Republican source told CNN. \n \n On Sunday talk shows, Republicans said the convention must focus on Romney's character and show how he can lead the nation to economic prosperity, which is the top issue with voters. \n \n \"It's the vision of Mitt Romney versus the record of Barack Obama, and facts just are stubborn things,\" Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell told ABC, adding that \"the middle class is hurting\" and people want \"results, not rhetoric.\" \n \n The Obama campaign, anticipating the Romney branding effort by Republicans, released a movie trailer-style video Sunday that previewed a \"do-over\" moment for Romney. \n \n In a statement accompanying the video, the Obama campaign said it is \"presenting Americans with an epic cinematic preview of Mitt Romney's 'convention reinvention' -- the Do-Over moment that voters have grown to expect -- because they've seen this movie before.\" \n \n Responding to the video, Romney's campaign said Sunday the president was relying on \"negative attacks\" as a way to distract from his own record. \n \n However, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa told ABC that Romney is vulnerable to being portrayed as a political opportunist because of the right-wing positions he adopted during the rugged primary campaign against conservatives such as Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich. \n \n \"I suspect that they are not going to be able to Etch A Sketch their way out of this campaign,\" Villaraigosa, a Democrat, said in a reference to a Romney aide's comment earlier this year about resetting the campaign message. \"They're not going to be able to put away all the things they said in the primary and all the things they have in their platform right now.\" \n \n Last week, controversial comments by conservative Republican Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri ignited a political firestorm about rape and abortion as the Romney team sought to build momentum up to the convention. \n \n Akin, who won Missouri's Republican Senate primary to challenge Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in November, told an interviewer that women have an undefined biological response to what he called \"legitimate rape\" that oftentimes prevents pregnancy. \n \n Rove slams Akin \n \n Romney and a full spectrum of GOP politicians, from the RNC to tea party groups, condemned Akin's comments and called for him to drop out of a race considered crucial to Republican hopes of winning a Senate majority. \n \n Akin apologized and called his remarks incorrect, but he has refused to end his Senate bid. The imbroglio has given new life to McCaskill, considered the most vulnerable Democratic senator running, and caused chagrin within the Republican establishment. \n \n Republican strategist Karl Rove kept up the criticism of Akin on Monday, telling a breakfast in Tampa hosted by Politico that Akin is a good man with a good heart who \"said a really stupid, indefensible thing from which there is no recovery, and if he really cares about the values of conservatism and pro-life, he will not go down for defeat as the biggest loss by a Republican candidate for Senate in modern history.\" \n \n Some conservatives, including former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, have defended Akin's decision to stay in the Missouri race, but Rove was unmoved. \n \n \"I talk to some conservatives who say, 'It's not fair. We have to stand with him,'\" Rove said. \"Well, it is unfair. I get that. But it was also incredibly wrong, and there was no recovery from it. It would be one thing if it was some minor misstatement. But this was pseudo-science and morally incomprehensible.\" \n \n A further concern is that Akin's comments focused attention on the volatile abortion issue in the run-up to the convention, when the Romney campaign wanted to talk about the candidate's prescriptions for high unemployment and slow economic growth under Obama. \n \n Instead, Romney and Ryan, the conservative House Budget Committee chairman, have been asked repeatedly about differences between their personal views on whether abortion should be banned in all cases or permitted only for pregnancies from rape, incest or that threaten the life of the mother. \n \n Romney's Mormon faith supports the narrow exceptions, while Ryan -- a devout Catholic -- supports a blanket ban. The campaign has made clear the ticket supports Romney's stance, which also contrasts with the party platform that convention delegates are scheduled to vote on this week. \n \n In an interview with Fox broadcast on Sunday, Romney again answered questions on the Akin comments, saying \"it obviously is being used by Democrats to try and cast a shadow on our entire party, and it's not.\" \n \n At the same time, Romney noted that Democrats are \"wise enough to understand\" that Akin's comments can hurt Republicans. \n \n Meanwhile, a new Romney ad Sunday continued his campaign's aggressive stance on another potentially vulnerable issue: Medicare. \n \n Romney on faith, family and private life \n \n Like previous Romney spots, the new ad includes a claim that, \"As president, Barack Obama cut $700 billion from Medicare to pay for Obamacare,\" the 2010 health care reform law despised by Republicans. \n \n The claim cites a report from the Congressional Budget Office that shows repeal of the president's health care law would mean an additional $716 billion in spending on Medicare. However, it ignored the same report's finding that the additional spending would come from rising costs and inefficiencies that the health care law would have addressed, rather than restoring money cut from Medicare. \n \n The Obama campaign has called the Romney claim on Medicare false, citing the CBO report, and repeatedly attacked the Medicare reform plan proposed by Ryan that would partially privatize the government-run health care program for senior citizens. Democrats claim the Republican proposal would \"end Medicare as we know it,\" while Ryan says his plan is the kind of reform necessary to ensure Medicare's long-term solvency. \n \n According to the poll results released Sunday, likely voters are evenly divided between the candidates on the Medicare issue. \n \n CNN's social media guide to the conventions \n \n CNN's Kevin Bohn, Paul Steinhauser, Dana Davidsen, Ashley Killough, Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Halimah Abdullah, Martina Stewart and Mark Preston contributed to this report.",

    "document": "Pieces of flint tools dropped more than 4,300 years ago on the floor of a house as old as Stonehenge have been laid bare on the edge of Marden Henge, a giant ditch and bank enclosure so buried in rich Wiltshire farmland that it has almost vanished from view. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve over-fetishised Stonehenge for far too long, because those giant trilithons are just so damn impressive,\u201d said Dr Jim Leary, director of this summer\u2019s excavation with the Reading University archaeology summer school, in the lush Vale of Pewsey. \u201cIt could well be that this was really where it was at in the Neolithic.\u201d \n \n The rectangular building will welcome visitors next weekend for an open day which is part of the national festival of archaeology. The house, believed to be one of the best preserved from the period ever found in the UK, and made to look smarter with tonnes of white chalk brought from miles away and stamped into a kind of plaster, is as neatly levelled and regular as the nearby postwar bungalows built on top of part of the henge bank. \n \n The house and other parts of the huge site have already produced finds including beautifully worked flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery including some pieces with the residue of the last meals cooked in them, shale and copper bracelets and a beautiful little Roman brooch \u2013 and the tiny jawbone of a vole. Analysis of the mass of seeds and charred grains recovered will reveal what the people were growing and eating. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Some of the flint arrowheads discovered at the site Photograph: Kevin Standage \n \n Pig bones \u2013 probably the remains of at least 13 animals, food for hundreds of people \u2013 and scorch marks from a charcoal firepit suggest the house was never a permanent residence but connected with great gatherings for feasts. When it was abandoned the entire site, pig bones and all, was cleaned and neatly covered with earth, so it would never be used again. \n \n The structure originally stood on a terrace overlooking a mound, within a small earth-banked circle, in turn part of the enormous Marden Henge. \n \n Leary, joined by archaeology students, professionals and amateurs from all over the world, who will continue working on the site for years to come, is peeling back the layers of a monument that was once one of the biggest and most impressive in Britain. Ramparts three metres high enclosed a vast space of 15 hectares, far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use. \n \n Leary believes the purpose must have been status, showing off wealth and power in the ability to mobilise a massive workforce. \u201cAvebury had the huge ditches, Stonehenge upped the ante with the massive trilothons, Marden had this enormous enclosure.\u201d \n \n The site is so vast that it takes Leary and fellow director Amanda Clarke 40 minutes to walk from the team working on the house to the diggers who have uncovered a previously unrecorded Roman complex including the foundations of an impressive barn. \n \n Like the Durrington Walls henge a few miles downstream, and Stonehenge itself, Marden was linked to the river Avon by a navigable flow, now a sedge- and nettle-choked stream, which forms one side of the henge. \n \n \u201cAvebury in one direction and Stonehenge in the other have been excavated and studied for centuries because the preservation of the monuments on chalk is so much better. Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valleys because the land is so good the monuments have often been ploughed out above ground \u2013 but it is a key part of understanding the story.\u201d \n \n Marden\u2019s banks, cut through by later roads or lying under modern farm buildings, grazing cows and ripening crops in many places, once stood three metres tall, towering over an equally deep ditch. The outer ring enclosed a complex of smaller monuments, including the Hatfield Barrow, which was once 15 metres tall, and now survives only as a 15cm ripple in the field. It was excavated in 1807 and, after a collapse caused by the shaft, later completely levelled by the farmer. \n \n The site welcomes visitors every day, but the open day will have finds on display, tours and activities. It will be among more than 1,000 events across the country over the last fortnight of July, including lectures, site tours and visits to archaeology stores and structures normally closed to the public. ||||| Image copyright Reading University Image caption The body, which is about 1.5m in length and wearing an amber necklace, was found lying in a foetal position \n \n A 4,000-year-old Bronze Age skeleton, believed to be that of a child, has been unearthed by archaeologists at a dig in Wiltshire. \n \n The team from the University of Reading made the discovery while excavating Wilsford henge in the Vale of Pewsey. \n \n The body was found lying in a foetal position and wearing an amber necklace. \n \n Reading University archaeologist Dr Jim Leary described the skeleton as a \"wonderful discovery\". \n \n He said: \"Scientific analysis will provide information on the gender of the child, diet, pathologies and date of burial. \n \n \"It may also shed light on where this young individual had lived.\" \n \n The three-year Vale of Pewsey dig is a partnership between the University of Reading, Historic England, the Arts and Humanities Research Council and Wiltshire Museum. \n \n The aim is to gain a better understanding of the people who lived in the areas surrounding Stonehenge. \n \n Findings to date include flint arrowheads and blades, decorated pottery, shale and copper bracelets and a Roman brooch. \n \n Image copyright Reading University Image caption Scientific analysis will provide information on the gender of the child, its diet and date of burial \n \n During the last six weeks the team has focused on Marden henge and Wilsford henge. \n \n Dr Leary said: \"Finds from the first five weeks of the dig were exciting - but as so often during excavations the best is revealed last.\" \n \n Built in 2,400 BC, Marden henge is the largest prehistoric monument of its kind in the country. \n \n Duncan Wilson, of Historic England, said: \"Bigger than Avebury, 10 times the size of Stonehenge and halfway between the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Sites, comparatively little is known about this fascinating and ancient landscape. \n \n \"The work will help Historic England focus on identifying sites for protection and improved management, as well as adding a new dimension to our understanding of this important archaeological environment.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 You think Stonehenge is impressive? Archaeologists in Britain are excavating a monument ten times larger than the iconic structure, though it appears to the naked eye to be little more than farmland. A henge is a circular earthwork, and the one in question is Marden Henge, which sits a few miles north of Stonehenge in Wiltshire. National Geographic reports that roughly 4,500 years ago it featured 10-foot-tall earthen berms that encompassed some 40 acres. The Guardian writes that the henge was \"far larger than the Avebury or Stonehenge circles, and too large for any imaginable practical use.\" But over the ages Marden Henge's berms have \"slumped\" and farmers have worked the land, and archaeologists have gravitated to the more breathtaking Stonehenge. Until now. Jim Leary of the University of Reading has just kicked off a three-year study of the site; his excavations (he worked at the site in 2010, too) are the only ones to have occurred there in nearly 50 years. He hopes the berms will help explain the \"insane, utterly unsustainable\" construction boom that led to Marden Henge and four other nearby Neolithic monuments, including Stonehenge. \"Not nearly enough attention has been paid to the archaeology of the fertile valley in between these places,\" says Leary.

(AP) \u2014 A prominent builder for celebrities' homes was identified by authorities Sunday as being one of four people on board a small plane that crashed off the coast of Long Island, killing two and leaving two missing. \n \n East Hampton Town Police identified the people as 70-year-old builder Bernard Krupinski, 70-year-old Bonnie Krupinski, 22-year-old William Maerov and 47-year-old Jon Dollard. \n \n The Federal Aviation Administration said the Piper PA31 aircraft that the four people were in went down about 3 p.m. Saturday.

East Hampton police confirmed the trio were aboard the flight, along with 47-year-old pilot Jon Dollard. \n \n All are believed to have perished in the crash, sources said. \n \n The Piper PA-31 Navajo plane went down about a mile off shore near Indian Wells Beach at about 2:50 p.m., officials told The Post. \n \n The cause of the crash is under investigation, but local pilot Bill Gardiner noted that the weather had turned stormy. \n \n \u201cThere was a very nasty thunderstorm going on. It was unexpected. There were very strong downdrafts.\u201d \n \n The Krupinskis had owned the plane since at least the 1980s, Gardiner added. \n \n The couple\u2019s real-estate empire is worth a reported $150 million, and included the popular East Hampton restaurant Citta Nuova, where grieving workers and patrons gathered Saturday night in shock, some in tears. \n \n see also Bodies recovered from plane crash off Long Island coast A plane with four people aboard crashed into the Atlantic... \n \n The couple, known and loved by locals as \u201cBennie and Bonnie\u201d \u2014 high-school sweethearts well known for their charitable endeavors \u2014 had been expected there for dinner that night. \n \n Instead, the restaurant was shuttered, a sign explaining that the closing was \u201cdue to a family emergency.\u201d \n \n \u201cThey were generous beyond belief,\u201d sobbed longtime employee Jeanne Nielsen. \n \n \u201cThey were very philanthropic . . . their grandson Will had worked here for the summer in the past. He was a student at Georgetown,\u201d she said. \n \n \u201cTheir granddaughter, Charlotte, is 15 or 16. She was not on the plane. She was going to work here this summer.\u201d \n \n The family \u201cflew all the time,\u201d Nielsen said. \u201cThey were coming here for dinner tonight, and then going to the movies. Their plane was supposed to land at 3.\u201d \n \n She added, still crying, \u201cThey were together forever. They were the couple that was together \u00adforever.\u201d \n \n As for the restaurant\u2019s workers, Nielsen said, \u201cWe\u2019re broken. All of us.\u201d \n \n Cops blockading the couple\u2019s home on Three Mile Harbor Road asked a reporter to give the family privacy. \n \n Two bodies were \u00adrecovered by Saturday night, the U.S. Coast Guard said. \n \n One was recovered by an East Hampton lifeguard using a Jet Ski, and the other by the Coast Guard, an agency spokeswoman for the Coast Guard told Newsday. \n \n A pocketbook was plucked from the water by commercial fisherman Dave Aripotch, who told Newsday he responded to the scene after mariners were given notice of the crash. \n \n \u201cI wish we could have got there sooner,\u201d he said of seeing a piece of the plane\u2019s nose in the water. \n \n Ben Krupinski, an East Hampton native, pilot and golf lover, rose to prominence building lavish homes for Stewart, Joel and rocker Roger Waters of Pink Floyd. \n \n He counted moguls such as Leon Black among his clients \u2014 but would pitch in and repair a broken sidewalk out of his own pocket, said those who knew him. \n \n Fellow developer Joe Farrell called Krupinski \u201ca legendary builder.\u201d \n \n \u201cTruly a great builder that built the biggest and most expensive homes,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cI admired and respected him very much. \n \n \u201cHis wife Bonnie was a Bistrian, and a huge land owner. Bonnie sold me many lots,\u201d Farrell recalled. \n \n \u201cBen used to lend me his helicopter. He was very nice to me even though we were competitors.\u201d \n \n Famous adman Jerry Della Femina once told The New York Times, \u201cIn East Hampton, Ben\u2019s the star.

It\u2019s Ben Krupinski!\u2019\u201d \n \n East Hampton gallery owner Terry Wallace said Ben Krupinski would often be at the controls of the plane. \n \n \u201cA lot of times he flies his own plane. He does a lot of things in the village,\u201d Wallace said. \n \n \u201cHe just finished the Ladies\u2019 Village Improvement Society. If there\u2019s a problem like the sidewalks, he\u2019ll just fix it for nothing. He does a lot of things for nothing,\u201d Wallace said. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re good people.\u201d \n \n Krupinski was so close with lifestyles queen Stewart, \u201che took his plane and got her\u201d when she was released from prison in 2005, \u00adWallace added. \n \n Local resident Bob Miller said, \u201cIt\u2019s so sad. It was Ben and Bonnie? That\u2019s so sad. He\u2019s been very involved for decades. Incredibly highly regarded. He\u2019s been a builder out here for a long, long time. I\u2019ve never heard a bad thing about him out here.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe are stricken by this loss,\u201d said Coast Guard Capt. Kevin B. Reed, commander Sector Long Island Sound. \n \n \u201cOur deepest sympathies go out to the families and loved ones of the two recovered individuals.\u201d \n \n Krupinski\u2019s only child, Laura Krupinski, 52, is a former Wilhelmina model who once publicly accused her father of having an affair with Stewart. \n \n Grandson Maerov had just started a job with ad agency Chandelier Creative, according to a post on his Facebook page. \n \n The crown jewel of Ben Krupinski\u2019s real-estate empire was East Hampton Point, a five-acre property with a 400-seat restaurant facing Three Mile Harbor. \n \n It included a full-service marina, boatyard, 14 guest houses, a pool and tennis courts. \n \n In 2015 he began building for Waters a 14,000-square-foot house with a swimming pool, a pool house and a sunken tennis court. \n \n Among the properties on which Ben worked for Stewart was a cottage and a 24-room manse, for which he was said to have created a hidden kitchen-exhaust system. \n \n In 1989, Krupinski renovated Bill Joel\u2019s 12,000-square-foot Amagansett home. \n \n Saturday\u2019s tragedy was the second small-plane crash on Long Island in less than a week.

    "document": "Image courtesy of Before the site went down for prolonged \"maintenance\" Accessory Outlet included a clause in its Terms of Sale that charged a $250 penalty to complaining customers. \n \n Online Retailer Will Fine You $250 If You Even Threaten To Complain About Purchase \n \n If you were put off by KlearGear.com\u2019s ridiculous \u201cNon-Disparagement\u201d fee , which penalizes customers for sharing their bad shopping experiences with the public, another online retailer is apparently trying to go one further, by not only banning customers from saying bad things online, but by also forbidding them from even bringing up the threat of a complaint or a credit card chargeback. \n \n \u2014\u2014 \n \n UPDATE: For more on the sketchy shenanigans of Accessory Outlet, check out this follow-up story. \n \n UPDATE #2: On the morning of 8/29/2014, the various Accessory Outlet sites were all pulled down and replaced with a message saying they were \u201cundergoing maintenance.\u201d \n \n \u2014\u2014 \n \n Buried at the bottom of the Terms page for OnlineAccessoryOutlet.com, you\u2019ll find the following insanely overreaching stipulations (bolded for emphasis): \n \n \u201cYou agree not to file any complaint, chargeback, claim, dispute, or make any public forum post, review, Better Business Bureau complaint, social media post, or any public statement regarding the order, our website, or any issue regarding your order, for any reason, within this 90 day period, or to threaten to do so within the 90 day period, or it is a breach of the terms of sale, creating liability for damages in the amount of $250, plus any additional fees, damages \u2013 both consequential and incidental, calculated on an ongoing basis.\u201d \n \n The Terms also claim the customer agrees that, even after the 90 days are up, the \u201csole method of dispute resolution in all cases\u2026 shall be binding arbitration to take place in New York City, with all expenses paid by the respective parties.\u201d \n \n So if your purchase is late, lost, damaged, broken, etc., and you even make the vague statement of \u201cI\u2019m going to write about this on Facebook\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m going to call my bank to cancel this charge,\u201d Accessory Outlet will tag you for $250. And even if you wait the full 90 days for that period to end, the only way to resolve the issue is by traveling \u2014 at your own expense \u2014 to New York City for an arbitration hearing. \n \n And this is apparently neither a joke nor an exaggerated policy made in the hope that someone will be too scared of the fine to complain. \n \n One Accessory Outlet customer in Wisconsin was fined the $250 for telling the retailer that she would issue a chargeback on her credit card because the $40 iPhone case she\u2019d ordered hadn\u2019t arrived after 10 days. And then when she refused to pay that fine, it was sent to collections. \n \n The customer has sued Accessory Outlet in a New York state court, arguing that the $250 \u201cdebt\u201d she is now being hassled over is bogus. According to the complaint [PDF], the \u201cterms are unenforceable, both because they are unconscionable as a matter of law and because [the Plaintiff] never agreed to them.\u201d \n \n That last claim is the most obvious and the easiest to prove. Though the Terms are on the Accessory Outlet website, at no point in the purchase process is the customer required to check a box or otherwise acknowledge that the Terms have been read. We attempted to verify the Plaintiff\u2019s claim by going all the way through the ordering process (up until actually hitting the \u201ccomplete purchase\u201d button, of course) and could not find any place in which it was even suggested that we read the Terms before placing an order. \n \n According to the customer, she placed her order on July 6 of this year. Four days later, she received an e-mail saying her order had shipped. The customer then checked the supposed USPS tracking number of her order and found that it had not been received by the Postal Service. \n \n When the item had not been received by July 16, she contacted the company via its website and requested that the order be canceled. Accessory Outlet replied that it could not be canceled because it had shipped. \n \n The customer checked the USPS tracking number again and then replied to Accessory Outlet that she would be requesting a chargeback from her credit card company because she believed the retailer was lying about whether the order had actually shipped. \n \n This is when they told her about the $250 fine that she hadn\u2019t agreed to. \n \n The company told her in an e-mail that not only would she be hit for the $250 penalty but that her account would be sent to a collections agency, which would \u201cput a negative mark on your credit for 7 years and will also result in calls to you home and/or work.\u201d \n \n Accessory Outlet also threatened her with the prospect of \u201cadditional fees for any correspondence with your card issuer\u2026 billed to you on an hourly basis and a flat rate $50 fee for the dispute or claim.\u201d \n \n When the customer replied that she had the right to contact her credit card company, the retailer replied that she now owed them \u201cdamages\u201d and that her account would be referred to \u201cmultiple collections agencies.\u201d \n \n After receiving additional, similar e-mails from Accessory Outlet, the customer responded that she was getting a lawyer. \n \n To which the retailer replied: \n \n \u201cContact your lawyer, spend more time and money if you wish. You will be billed and the amount we bill you for will continue to rise with every email and every second we dedicate o correspondence of any kind pertaining to your breach of the terms of sale. Thank you.\u201d \n \n A subsequent e-mail from Accessory Outlet personally attacks the customer and closes on a menacing tone: \n \n \u201cRead the agreement or have someone competent do so for you since your emails make it clear you did not read the agreement or do not understand the clauses contained therein. You obviously do not know how to use the tracking or are ignoring it\u2026 You are playing games with the wrong people and have made a very bad mistake given the legally binding contract we have in place. One we have successfully enforced on many individuals the same we will do with you.\u201d \n \n The customer eventually received her order \u2014 nine days after it supposedly shipped \u2014 and claims it was defective and unusable. Her complaints to Accessory Outlet received no response. \n \n She seeks to have her alleged debts voided because she did not actively agree to the Terms of Sale, nor was she required to view them. Additionally, the customer claims the terms are unreasonably favorable to Accessory Outlet. \n \n \u201cI want to go online and warn other customers about Accessory Outlet\u2019s unfair terms and shoddy products,\u201d said the customer in a statement. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid Accessory Outlet will claim I owe it more money and try to ruin my credit.\u201d \n \n \u201cAccessory Outlet is using unfair terms hidden in fine print, along with threatening emails, to bully a customer into keeping quiet about her bad experience with the company,\u201d said Scott Michelman, the Public Citizen attorney handling the case. \u201cBut terms that prevent a customer from speaking publicly about her transaction and from contacting her credit card company are unreasonable and unenforceable.\u201d \n \n UPDATE: While we had assumed that Accessory Outlet\u2019s touted \u201cA+\u201d rating from the Better Business Bureau was as real as the time I made out with Scarlett Johansson, a reader points us to the New York BBB site, where Accessory Outlet not only has an \u201cF\u201d rating, but where the BBB states in all caps that \u201cTHIS FIRM IS NOT CURRENTLY A BBB ACCREDITED BUSINESS,\u201d and that it has been served a cease-and-desist demanding it remove the badge from the site. \u201cAs of August 19, 2014 this firm has not replied to BBB\u2019s requests and continues to advertise the BBB name, logo, and incorrect rating on its website,\u201d writes the BBB. \n \n For fun and giggles, we\u2019ve written to the three other organizations touted on the site \u2014 Angie\u2019s List, buySAFE, and Trusted Shops \u2014 to confirm that these endorsements are also false. \n \n We\u2019ve heard back from a rep for buySAFE, who confirmed that Accessory Outlet is not certified. \n \n \u201cThe seal you see is an old, bad copy of a buySAFE seal,\u201d explains the rep. \n \n And a rep for Angie\u2019s List says there is no way Accessory Outlet could have won a Super Service Award \u2014 which requires perfect scores \u2014 because it has no reviews on the site. \n \n \u201cThey have no reviews, which equals no grade,\u201d explains the Angie\u2019s rep. \u201cThey aren\u2019t SSA winners and shouldn\u2019t be using the badge.\u201d \n \n And a rep for Trusted Shops, which does not certify companies in the U.S. says Accessory Outlet is definitely not certified by the service. ||||| A Wisconsin woman has filed a lawsuit in New York state court against a shady online retailer, Accessory Outlet, which had threatened her by saying, \u201cYou are playing games with the wrong people\u201d after she attempted to cancel an order for a $40 iPhone case that did not arrive on time. \n \n The woman, Cindy Cox, is being represented by the advocacy group Public Citizen, which recently won summary judgment and damages of over $300,000 earlier this year in a related case in Utah involving the French parent company of KlearGear, a similarly unscrupulous vendor. She is seeking declaratory judgment that the company\u2019s self-imposed \u201cdebt\u201d of $250 is invalid and that the company engaged in deceptive practices. \n \n \u201cAccessory Outlet is using unfair terms hidden in fine print, along with threatening emails, to bully a customer into keeping quiet about her bad experience with the company,\u201d Scott Michelman, the Public Citizen attorney handling the case, said in a statement. \u201cBut terms that prevent a customer from speaking publicly about her transaction and from contacting her credit card company are unreasonable and unenforceable.\u201d \n \n According to the civil complaint filed Wednesday, Cox is a disabled veteran of the United States Navy and is a substitute teacher for special needs children in the Kenosha Unified School District. \n \n Accessory Outlet did not immediately respond to Ars\u2019 request for comment. \n \n \u201cYou agree not to file any complaint\u2026\u201d \n \n The story begins on July 6, 2014, when Cox placed an order for $39.94 for an iPhone case. In so doing, she accepted to be bound by \u201call terms and conditions contained in [the site's] agreement,\u201d which describes a refund policy and a privacy policy, but not the actual Terms of Sale that the company posts in a hard-to-find link at the bottom of the site. \n \n Those terms include this provision: \n \n You agree not to file any complaint, chargeback, claim, dispute, or make any public forum post, review, Better Business Bureau complaint, social media post, or any public statement regarding the order, our website, or any issue regarding your order, for any reason, within this 90 day period, or to threaten to do so within the 90 day period, or it is a breach of the terms of sale, creating liability for damages in the amount of $250, plus any additional fees, damages - both consequential and incidental, calculated on an ongoing basis. \n \n On July 10, Cox received an e-mail from Accessory Outlet saying that her order had shipped and provided her with a tracking number. When Cox went to check the tracking number online, she discovered that the package was not being processed via the United States Postal Service. \n \n Six days later, Cox e-mailed the company, asking that the order be canceled as it had not been received. Accessory Outlet informed her that the order could not be refunded as it had already shipped. When she checked the tracking number a second time and saw that the item had still not shipped, she informed the company that she would tell her credit card company to reverse the payment. \n \n \u201cContact your lawyer, spend more time and money if you wish.\u201d \n \n Accessory Outlet responded with rhetorical force, saying that it would impose its aforementioned $250 penalty and would employ a collections agency to get its money. According to the complaint, the firm told her that \u201cthis will put a negative mark on your credit for 7 years and will also result in calls to your home and/or work.\" \n \n \u201cFurther,\" the company told her, \"additional fees for any correspondence with your card insurer will also be billed to you on an hourly basis and a flat rate $50 for the dispute or claim.\u201d \n \n Cox, undeterred, told the company not to threaten her and said that she would be contacting a lawyer and the Better Business Bureau. \n \n Accessory Outlet responded the next day, July 17: \u201cContact your lawyer, spend more time and money if you wish. You will be billed and the amount we will bill you for will continue to rise with every email and every second we dedicate to correspondence of any kind pertaining to your breach of the terms of sale. Thank you.\u201d \n \n Cox discussed the transaction with her credit card company, but she opted to not dispute the charge on the off-chance that the item would finally arrive. She then informed Accessory Outlet that she had done so, to which it replied: \n \n There is clear proof it was sent and left NY and we will have proof of delivery. The collections action is separate and based solely on breach of contract and will be done even though you paid for and received the merchandise due to your breach of the terms of sale. Read the agreement or have someone competent do so for you since your emails make it clear you did not read the agreement or do not understand the clauses contained therein. You also obviously do not know how to use the tracking or are ignoring it. Either way you will pay us $250 on top of the order total or have continuous calls to your home, cell, and/or work phones to collect the debt due. You are playing games with the wrong people and have made a very bad mistake given the legally binding contract we have in place. One we have successfully enforced on many individuals the same we will do with you. \n \n On July 19, Cox finally received her iPhone case, but \u201cit was warped and would not snap closed.\u201d",

The Secretary of State said an individual tried to register the vehicles under the same VIN number. \n \n \u201cSCAR identified the first one in the Holland area back in October,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThe second vehicle recently resurfaced in the state of Mississippi.\u201d \n \n Mississippi Bureau of Investigation officials said the car was located at a residence in Columbia, Miss. \u201cThe investigation is ongoing regarding the vehicle\u2019s history and whereabouts during the past three decades,\u201d the MBI said in a statement. \n \n Shaw said SCAR worked with the Mississippi police and the National Insurance Crime Bureau to trace the vehicle back to Talley. The investigation revealed that Talley\u2019s claim was never paid by his insurance and he remains the owner of the car. \n \n Talley said when he received an initial phone call from his insurance company notifying him that the car was found, he thought it was a joke. But when the Michigan State Police called, he couldn\u2019t believe his luck. \n \n \u201cI said, \u2018This isn\u2019t no joke. They wouldn\u2019t be joking with me because I don\u2019t think they have time to play with me,\u2019\u201d Talley said. \u201cI was shocked.\u201d \n \n The last time Talley, now 71 and retired in Detroit, saw his beloved car was when it was parked on Jefferson Avenue in July 1981. Then the car disappeared. Talley reported the incident to police, but never thought he\u2019d see his car again. \n \n Talley said he\u2019s a Corvette lover and has owned four different models. \n \n \u201cThey looked into it, but didn\u2019t recover it and nothing happened and 33 years passed,\u201d Talley said. \u201cIt was a great thing that the MSP and Mississippi State troopers, they did their job and found it.\u201d \n \n \u25a0 Related: Stolen Mustang returns home, 20 years later \n \n \u25a0 Related: Last Corvette retrieved from museum sinkhole \n \n Talley was told the car still runs, has 47,000 miles on it and is at the Hattiesburg police station. But he was concerned about how he would fetch it. \n \n \u201cI woke up this morning,\u201d Talley said during an interview with Paul W. Smith on WJR Wednesday. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ve got to get on the phone and find a trucker or somebody to bring it back\u2019 \u2014 or go get it or something.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, GM\u2019s Executive Vice President Mark Reuss had heard the radio segment and offered to pick up Talley\u2019s car. \n \n \u201cI listened to you this morning,\u201d Reuss said on the show. \u201cWe just had to do something.\u201d \n \n Talley, who said he worked at GM\u2019s Milford Proving Grounds, was happy to hear the news. \n \n \u201cI was worried,\u201d he said, referring to how he was going to get the car back. \n \n \u201cWell,\u201d Smith told him. \u201cNothing to worry about now. The Corvette is on its way safe and sound.\u201d \n \n Talley said GM told him they would notify him within the next few days to let him know when the car will arrive. \n \n \u201cGM is paying for all of that, which is beautiful,\u201d Talley said. ||||| (WXYZ) - When George Talley tells an old story, there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019ll mention his old rides. \n \n \"I\u2019ve always liked Corvettes. It was attractive. The ladies like \u2018em,\u201d said George. \n \n But so did the thieves, and George learned that the hard way. The last time he saw his \u201879 Corvette, it was parked on Jefferson Avenue 33 years ago. \n \n \"I made a police report, and I haven\u2019t seen it since July of 1981,\u201d said George. \n \n George often wondered about the one that got away. That is until recently. \n \n \"I was sitting at home last Friday looking at Judge Mathis, and I get a call from AAA telling me you have a Corvette in Mississippi, come and get it. And, uh\u2026 I said, \u2018what?\u2019\u201d \n \n Authorities say a dubious vin number helped track the Vette three decades later. And the car is still in pretty good shape. \n \n \"I\u2019ve heard it was running, it had 47,000 miles on it, and right now, it\u2019s at the police station in Hattiesburg,\u201d said George. \n \n As of Tuesday it\u2019s still up in the air whether George would ship it or bring the car back himself. That all changed Wednesday morning when General Motor's Executive Vice President, Global Product Development, Purchasing and Supply Chain Mark Reuss announced that he was offering to bring the Vette home - at GM's expense. \n \n The offer came during The Paul W. Smith show on News/Talk 760 AM WJR radio. \n \n \"It\u2019s a lucky day. When I get that car here in that driveway, we\u2019ll go from there,\u201d said George, before learning of the offer.",

Better yet, it seems to be in decent shape, with only 47,000 miles. Talley, now 71 and still the rightful owner, told the tale on a Detroit radio station today, his only lament being that he had to figure out how to get the car shipped to Michigan. Enter GM exec Mark Reuss, who happened to catch the show, reports the Detroit Free Press. The company is going to pick up the car for its former employee and ship it back free of charge.

Lots of prospective voters are speaking out against him and don\u2019t feel he has any place even running for office. Many of those voices belong to celebrities, and here is a list of those who have publicly said they will leave the United States if Trump is elected president. \n \n Rev. Al Sharpton is the latest to reveal that he is willing to leave the United States if Trump is elected president. Right now, he is giving his support to virtually anyone but Trump, yet he has been very complimentary of Marco Rubio in hopes he wins the Republican nomination, according to The Washington Examiner. \n \n \u201cIf Donald Trump is the nominee, I\u2019m open to support anyone [else], while I\u2019m also reserving my ticket to get out of here if he wins, only because he\u2019d probably have me deported anyway.\u201d \n \n According to the NY Daily News, Raven Symone is making a lot more waves than she normally does on The View, and it is for her views on the next election. Symone is planning on moving to Canada if any Republican at all, including Trump, wins the presidency. \n \n \u201cI already have my ticket. I literally bought my ticket, I swear.\u201d \n \n Jon Stewart, former host of the Daily Show, was one of the the first celebrities to throw his name out there. He had been asked if he\u2019d considered returning to his old desk if Trump were to become president, but he shot that down in an instant and said that wasn\u2019t happening. \n \n [Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images] Not only is Stewart prepared to leave the United States, but he\u2019s intent on actually departing Earth if Trump gets into office. Stewart said that he would get in a rocket and think about going to another planet because this planet \u201chas gone bonkers.\u201d \n \n Yes, he said it in a joking fashion and took it to another level, but not all celebrities and comedians are as lighthearted about it. \n \n As Fox News reported near the end of January, another host on The View is ready to depart the United States should Donald Trump become president. Whoopi Goldberg believes that the country electing him means \u201cit\u2019s time\u201d for her to move out. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve always been an American, and this has always been my country, and we\u2019ve always been able to have discussions.

They don\u2019t want to relive this. So I need all the candidates to get it together. Get back to American values.\u201d \n \n There are many more that are joining the list of celebrities who just want nothing more to do with the United States if Donald Trump keeps winning states. He\u2019s having a very strong showing in the primaries and caucuses, and he\u2019s not showing any signs of slowing down. \n \n [Image by Mike Coppola/Getty Images] Here is a list of other celebrities who have said they\u2019d be willing to leave the United States if Donald Trump is elected president. \n \n Rosie O\u2019Donnell \n \n Eddie Griffin \n \n Cher \n \n Samuel L.

Numerous political experts expect him to pull away on Super Tuesday, and move far enough in front of other Republican candidates that he won\u2019t be able to be caught. \n \n If Donald Trump does end up winning the presidency, then there could end up being a lot more controversy than there is now. One other thing to realize is that if Trump does end up in the White House, there will be a lot less celebrities in the United States as Al Sharpton, Samuel L. Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, Jon Stewart, and others may be gone. \n \n [Image by Tom Pennington/Getty Images] ||||| Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump once again took to Twitter Thursday to troll his favorite arch-nemesis -- Rosie O'Donnell -- as his administration faces an intensifying political firestorm over the firing of FBI Director James Comey. \n \n \"We finally agree on something Rosie,\" Trump tweeted, along with a link to a December 2016 O'Donnell tweet that read: \"FIRE COMEY.\" \n \n While this latest attack is tame in comparison to the colorful and harsh insults Trump has hurled at the actress, there is one big thing that ups the stakes: Trump is now President, and as CNN's Chris Cillizza writes , \"the single most powerful person in the world.\" \n \n \"@realDonaldTrump - u don't even realize the kind of trouble u r in - comeys people believe in him - for real - they have the proof - u r a sadistic man #USA\" O'Donnell replied in a tweet Thursday. \n \n @realDonaldTrump - u don't even realize the kind of trouble u r in - comeys people believe in him - for real - they have the proof - u r a sadistic man #USA \n \n But this is only the latest development -- and likely not the last -- in Trump and O'Donnell's decades-long, highly public feud. \n \n How did it start? Here is a timeline, documenting highlights from 2006-2017: \n \n December 2006 \n \n When Trump decided not to fire Miss USA Tara Conner after revelations of drug use, underage drinking and sexual activities, the co-owner of the Miss USA pageant raised some eyebrows. \n \n \"I've always been a believer in second chances. Tara is a good person. Tara has tried hard. Tara is going to be given a second chance,\" Trump said on December 19. Conner was allowed to keep her crown but had to go to rehab. \n \n The next day O'Donnell, who was a co-host of \"The View\" at the time, criticized his decision, saying that she doesn't \"enjoy\" Trump and said he went bankrupt -- a claim Trump continues to deny, most recently at Thursday's GOP debate. \n \n She added that Trump is \"not a self-made man\" but a \"snake-oil salesman on Little House On The Prairie,\" and she proceeded to slam his multiple marriages: \"[He] left the first wife -- had an affair. [He] had kids both times, but he's the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America. Donald, sit and spin, my friend.\" \n \n Following those comments, Trump fired back at the comedian and told People Magazine that O'Donnell is \"a real loser\" and \"a woman out of control.\" \n \n \"You can't make false statements. Rosie will rue the words she said,\" referencing her claims that he went bankrupt. \"I'll most likely sue her for making those false statements -- and it'll be fun. Rosie's a loser. A real loser. I look forward to taking lots of money from my nice fat little Rosie.\" \n \n May 2007 \n \n Only eight months after joining \"The View,\" O'Donnell left the show after a heated spat with fellow co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck over the war in Iraq. \n \n Trump, who insulted both hosts, surprisingly took O'Donnell's side because he was also against the war. \n \n \"On this one I think Rosie should win, but Rosie is not much herself. I think anybody that's against the war in Iraq is the winner of the fight, because to justify the war in Iraq -- only an imbecile could do that,\" he told \"Extra,\" calling Hasselbeck \"not a very smart person, she's one of the dumber people in television.\" \n \n But this was not the beginning of a change of heart. \n \n December 2011 \n \n After O'Donnell announced her engagement to then-girlfriend Michelle Rounds in December, Trump took to Twitter to share his thoughts, tweeting, \"I feel sorry for Rosie 's new partner in love whose parents are devastated at the thought of their daughter being with @Rosie--a true loser.\" \n \n I feel sorry for Rosie 's new partner in love whose parents are devastated at the thought of their daughter being with @Rosie--a true loser. \u2014 Donald J.

When I don't like somebody their shows do really badly,\" he said, adding that it \"upsets\" him that O'Donnell's show is a \"disaster\" because he loves Oprah and wants her to be successful. \n \n May 2012 \n \n While attacking Cher for slamming then-Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Trump snuck in an insult directed at his favorite nemesis, tweeting \".@Cher attacked @MittRomney. She is an average talent who is out of touch with reality. Like @Rosie O'Donnell, a total loser!\" \n \n .@Cher attacked @MittRomney. She is an average talent who is out of touch with reality.

    "document": "After a Chicago cop paid a 14-year-old girl for sex in 2015, the girl told federal investigators intimate, granular details about their encounters \u2014 including the exact types of condoms he used: LifeStyles condoms and Trojan Magnum condoms in gold wrappers, court records said. \n \n It may seem like a trivial detail that William Whitley, 61, used one type of condom over another. But an FBI criminal complaint against the 20-year veteran of the Chicago Police Department points to the brands\u2019 relevance. The Trojan Magnum and LifeStyles condoms Whitley used to commit the crime came from outside Illinois, where the crime occurred \u2014 meaning his \u201cconduct affected interstate commerce,\u201d the complaint said. \n \n That interstate element (in addition to Whitley\u2019s use of a phone and other factors) made it possible to charge him in federal court, where Whitley pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of sex trafficking a minor, according to court records. \n \n Had Whitley not been charged at the federal level, he may have faced a state sentence less harsh than the mandatory 10-year minimum sentence that federal sex trafficking charges carry, the Chicago Tribune reports \u2014 which could explain why prosecutors sought federal charges.

He faces at least 10 years in prison, and could face up to life. \n \n Whitley said he didn\u2019t know the girl was only 14 when he had sex with her, according to court records. The teen girl had told Whitley she was 23 during their multiple sexual encounters in 2015. Investigators suggested the braces on the 14-year-old\u2019s teeth could have been a hint about her real age. \n \n Whitley maintained in court that braces \u201cdon\u2019t dictate a person\u2019s age,\u201d the Chicago Sun-Times reports. \n \n Whitley invited the 14-year-old girl to have sex with him at his apartment from June to September 2015, court records said. During the encounters, Whitley left his Chicago Police Department uniform hanging from his bedroom door, she said \u2014 and he even bragged about being a cop. Whitley also had a loaded firearm stashed under his pillow in bed, court records said. \n \n SHARE COPY LINK Human trafficking is a widespread concern that advocates and law enforcement officials say is on the rise throughout Fresno. Three women tell their stories of horror, survival and healing. \n \n Whitley used his smartphone to take sexually-explicit photos of the girl at his apartment, she told investigators. Authorities found the photos (which Whitley had texted to to the girl) when they searched the girl\u2019s phone. And when investigators searched Whitley\u2019s apartment, they discovered the same type of leopard print bedding that had been visible in the naked pictures, court records said. \n \n The October 2015 search of Whitley\u2019s home also revealed contacts on his phone \u2014 \u201cJasmine,\u201d \u201cBunny,\u201d \u201cBrittany Aka Mocha\u201d and \u201cStar\u201d \u2014 with whom Whitley was discussing prices and meeting times, suggesting he was engaged in prostitution with them, court records said. Investigators also found the kind of Trojan Magnum gold condom wrappers the girl had described. \n \n Beyond the 14-year-old victim, Whitley was also paying a 16-year-old runaway for sex, he admitted in his plea agreement. Whitley had originally met the 16-year-old girl at a party where older men were paying young runaways for sex, the 16-year-old told authorities. \n \n Later, Whitley spotted the girl walking though Chicago\u2019s Englewood neighborhood with a friend, court records said. Whitley pulled up next to them and asked the girl if she wanted to get in the car for a ride with him and \u201chis partner\u201d \u2014 which she believed meant he was a police officer, the girl told investigators. The girl got in the car, where Whitley was in the driver\u2019s seat and the \u201cpartner\u201d was in the passenger\u2019s seat. \n \n As they were driving, Whitley paid the girl $65 to perform oral sex on him, she told investigators. After that, Whitley became \u201cone of her primary commercial sex customers,\u201d court records said. \n \n When the 16-year-old had been with Whitley for some time, she began giving his phone number out to friends so they could also have sex with Whitley for money, court records said. \n \n Chicago police took away Whitley's police powers in September 2015, the Sun-Times reports. ||||| CPD veteran admits to paying young girls for sex, faces life in prison \n \n William Whitley acknowledged Tuesday he paid young girls for sex. \n \n The longtime veteran of the Chicago Police Department admitted he would order them up before he\u2019d go to work \u2014 leaving his uniform hanging on the bedroom door and his gun under his pillow while they were in bed. \n \n But even as he prepared to admit his guilt to a federal judge Tuesday, Whitley insisted that braces on the teeth of one young girl \u201cdon\u2019t dictate a person\u2019s age.\u201d He still thought she was older. \n \n U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall nevertheless accepted Whitley\u2019s guilty plea to one count of sex trafficking of a minor. He now faces a minimum of 10 years in prison but could be looking at a lifetime behind bars. His sentencing is set for Sept. 4. \n \n CPD has previously said Whitley was stripped of his powers in September 2015. He must register within days as a sex offender. Court personnel said his current residence is problematic, but Kendall gave him until Friday to find a new place to live. \n \n A grand jury accused Whitley last year of trafficking four teenage girls for sex, as well as producing child pornography. That followed a 2015 FBI investigation that authorities said led them to Whitley. \n \n When confronted, Whitley acknowledged he saw braces on the teeth of a 14-year-old girl he paid for sex, according to the criminal complaint that led to his arrest. But he said he did not know her age. She apparently told him she was 23. \n \n That same girl was arrested in a September 2015, but she told authorities about her \u201cjohns,\u201d including Whitley, according to the complaint. She said she was introduced to him in June 2015 and had sex with him about five times, collecting between $60 and $150 from him each time. \n \n She said he also wore a gold chain with the CPD logo on it. And at times, she said, he bragged about being a cop. \n \n The feds said Whitley was in touch with the girl by phone \u201chundreds of times\u201d between July 24, 2015 and Sept. 17, 2015. Once, after he began texting the girl, she replied, \u201cAwww ok wassup then.\u201d And he replied, \u201cYou already know\u201d and added, \u201cB4 I gotta work.\u201d \n \n The girl also said Whitley took naked photographs of her inside his apartment. \n \n The 14-year-old girl led authorities to a 16-year-old girl who also said she had sex with Whitley for money. She said Whitley pulled up next to her and a friend once in Englewood and asked if they wanted to take a ride with him and \u201chis partner.\u201d They agreed, though the girl said she suspected Whitley might be a cop based on the way he spoke. \n \n The 16-year-old girl said Whitley was in the driver\u2019s seat, and the partner was in the passenger seat. That\u2019s when she said Whitley gave her $65 \u201cin exchange for giving him oral sex.\u201d She said she had oral sex with Whitley five times, each time collecting $60 to $65 from him. ||||| Plenty of crimes have a technical element that allows prosecutors to pursue charges at the federal level, from using a phone to conduct illegal business across state lines to firing a gun manufactured in a different state. \n \n In the case of former Chicago police Officer William Whitley, it wasn\u2019t guns. It was condoms. \n \n Whitley\u2019s use of Trojan and LifeStyles brand condoms when he paid for sex acts with a 14-year-old girl, federal prosecutors say, meant he illegally affected interstate commerce. Because the condoms are made outside Illinois, using them in the act of a potential sex crime contributed to the ability to charge Whitley in U.S. District Court instead of the state level. \n \n Whitley pleaded guilty Tuesday in federal court to one count of sex trafficking of a minor. In the plea agreement, prosecutors specifically mention the condom use, stating \u201cWhitley used condoms during the commercial sex acts with Minor A\u201d and he \u201cacknowledges that Trojan condoms and LifeStyles condoms are manufactured outside the state of Illinois.\u201d \n \n There were other aspects of Whitley\u2019s actions that hit the \u201cfederal nexus,\u201d including his use of a cellphone to take compromising pictures of two girls and using money to pay them, prosecutors said. \n \n Whitley was a Chicago police officer during 2015 when, he now admits, he paid between $60 to $150 for sex acts with the girl referred to as Minor A. He also admitted to engaging in commercial sex acts with three other teenage girls. He is no longer employed by the department. Whitley\u2019s lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. \n \n The mechanisms that allowed prosecutors to pursue Whitley at the federal level are often used for gun crimes. Invoking condoms as an avenue to interstate commerce is a different twist. \n \n \u201cThe gun traveling is analogous to the condom traveling,\u201d said Juliet Sorensen, a Northwestern University law professor and former federal prosecutor. \u201cThe person who pulled the trigger may not have traveled, but the gun did. This police officer may not have traveled, but an aspect that he used to commit the crime did.\u201d \n \n Most LifeStyles condoms are manufactured in Thailand and India. Trojan corporate parent Church & Dwight is headquartered is in Ewing, N.J., and some of its varieties are made in Thailand and Japan, according to packaging. \n \n A federal sex trafficking charge carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison, a distinction that may have been important to prosecutors, Sorensen said. If Whitley would have been charged with the most serious level of sex crime in state court, a Class X felony, the minimum prison time would have been six years. \n \n The U.S. attorney\u2019s office also may have been making a policy statement about the seriousness of human trafficking when it made its decision to charge Whitley, she said. \n \n The preface to the \u201cPrinciples of Federal Prosecution\u201d page on the U.S. Department of Justice website offers a detailed explanation on how these decision should be made. The highlight: \u201cA determination to prosecute represents a policy judgment that the fundamental interests of society require the application of federal criminal law to a particular set of circumstances \u2014 recognizing both that serious violations of federal law must be prosecuted, and that prosecution entails profound consequences for the accused, crime victims, and their families.\u201d \n \n Joseph Fitzpatrick, the spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Chicago, declined to go into the specific reasoning why Whitley was charged federally. \n \n Prosecutors said Whitley violated Title 18, Sections 1591(a)(1) of the United States Code, which addresses sex trafficking of children by force, fraud or coercion. Whitley\u2019s sex acts with Minor A meant he \u201cknowingly recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, maintained, patronized, and solicited\u201d a minor, prosecutors said. \n \n Whitley, 61, who worked for more than two decades as a Chicago police officer, paid for sex with underage teen runaways at parties, in his apartment and even in his vehicle while riding around with his partner, federal prosecutors say. Whitley also took graphic photos of many of the girls on top of his leopard-print bedspread and had their numbers stored in his phone under names such as \u201cBunny,\u201d \u201cMocha\u201d and \u201cJasmine.\u201d He was arrested in November 2016. \n \n Minor A, who was 14 at the time of the sex acts, told investigators she initially lied to Whitley and told him she was 23. She wore metal braces on her teeth at the time. Data recovered from the girl\u2019s phone showed Whitley called or texted her hundreds of times. \n \n Whitley told the girl he was a police officer and kept his police uniform hanging up in his apartment on his bedroom door, according to court documents, and also kept a loaded firearm under his pillow on the bed where he engaged in commercial sex acts with the girl. \n \n In the plea agreement, Whitley also acknowledged he paid for sex acts with three other girls during his time as a police officer between 2012 and 2015. \n \n Although Whitley faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years in prison, he could receive more. He also will have to register as a sex offender. \n \n On Friday, Whitley, out on bond pending sentencing, was ordered jailed by U.S. District Judge Virginia Kendall after he failed to find a place to live that did not violate the terms of the sex offender registry. With Whitley unable to find a place to stay that met the guidelines, and with Friday as his deadline to register, Kendall ordered federal marshals to detain him. \n \n Whitley\u2019s sentencing hearing is scheduled for Sept. 4. \n \n The Tribune\u2019s Jason Meisner contributed. \n \n poconnell@chicagotribune.com \n \n Twitter @pmocwriter \n \n RELATED \n \n Chicago cop pleads guilty to having sex with 14-year-old girl, admits similar conduct with 3 other minors \u00bb",

And there are certainly aspects of its iconic \u201cReal Beauty\u201d campaign that resonate. The company\u2019s ads have tackled the culture\u2019s focus on youth, how stereotypical ideas about beauty can undermine young girls\u2019 confidence, and the gap between women\u2019s self-perception and how others see them. Given that beauty industry has historically spent a lot of time making women feel bad about themselves, it\u2019s refreshing to see any message of positivity and self-love. \n \n But Dove took a wrong turn yesterday when it released its latest body wash bottles, which come in a variety of shapes to\u2026 well, I\u2019ll let the company explain: \u201cFrom curvaceous to slender, tall to petite, and whatever your skin colour, shoe size or hair type, beauty comes in a million different shapes and sizes.

While the campaign isn\u2019t a misfire on the scale of Pepsi\u2019s recent \u201cprotest\u201d commercial, it still feels silly at best, condescending at worst. I don\u2019t know about you, but I have never felt oppressed by the shape of my toiletry bottles\u2014and I do not appreciate a company that so oversimplifies the complicated issue of how our society views women\u2019s bodies. \n \n It\u2019s a good reminder: Companies that use feminist themes in their ads may well buy into some of the messaging they use and can even help spread important ideas. But at the end of the day, they create those campaigns for one reason\u2014to sell you their stuff. \n \n A version of this post ran in the May 9th, 2017 edition of The Broadsheet, Fortune\u2019s daily newsletter about the world\u2019s most powerful women. ||||| Here\u2019s me. \n \n Close your eyes and picture the last bottle of bodywash you used in the shower. What was it shaped like? Was it tall and thin? Short and squat? Did it in any way resemble the shape of your own body? If no, were you deeply offended? Dove\u2019s latest campaign aims to help you overcome those (likely nonexistent) feelings of soap-induced self-loathing by selling bodywash in bottles with varying degrees of curves to promote body positivity. (The Real Beauty bottles are a limited run and currently only available in the U.K.) \n \n Naturally, the Dove bottles quickly jumped from promotional gag to Twitter meme. Just pick a bottle \u2014 a wine jug, two liters of Cheerwine, a plastic container of Draino, one of those blender things swole people use at the gym to let you know how swole they are \u2014 and let Dove know your body type is already being properly represented by a bottle out there. \n \n .@Dove matches its new body wash bottles to your body type pic.twitter.com/zzxy21DYuH \u2014 chekov's mankrik (@vrunt) May 8, 2017 \n \n sorry, Dove, I already found my body type pic.twitter.com/mBLzHgGzIw \u2014 Brett _______ (@BrettRedacted) May 8, 2017 \n \n thanks Dove but I already have a body wash that matches my natural curves :) pic.twitter.com/IIkKAn0LjQ \u2014 Tim Federle (@TimFederle) May 8, 2017 \n \n sry @Dove but i already have a body wash that looks like me pic.twitter.com/uT2oAtZ9f0 \u2014 sarah gorman (@thesarahgorman) May 8, 2017 \n \n Y'all are late to this game.

Hips larger than the bust? Pear. Waist larger that the hips? Apple. No curves? Banana. \n \n But now there\u2019s a new choice: Dove says women can also be soap bottles. \n \n The Unilever brand that\u2019s been on a mission to get women to embrace their \u201creal beauty\u201d for a few years\u2014while other Unilever brands teach other women to change the color of their own skin\u2014has launched a new campaign to empower women to embrace their body shape. \n \n In the UK, the company will sell a limited edition of six Real Beauty Bottles: unusually curvy shampoo bottles that look like they were inspired by a mix of illegal drugs and Constantin Brancusi. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve created a limited edition range of Dove Body Washes, designed to show how beauty is diverse and diversity is beautiful,\u201d said Unilever in a press release, explaining how these are intended to depict real women\u2019s bodies. All body wash bottles\u2014I mean, women\u2014are beautiful as they are. \n \n Many women do not seem pleased. Not only are they not running to the drugstore, they are making fun of the bottles. \n \n This is the apotheosis of Dove\u2019s misguided brand of \u201cempowering advertising,\u201d which tends to end up exploiting the very female insecurities that it claims to destroy. Well-intentioned or not, the message behind all of these campaigns is the same we\u2019ve always heard: Be beautiful. \n \n Of course, Dove is selling soap, not programming classes, so it makes sense\u2014but the attempt to mask that mandate as stereotype-busting is ineffective at best. It\u2019s just not that empowering to overhaul the ideals of feminine beauty: We\u2019re never going to find all people and bodies equally beautiful, no matter how many commercials feature women getting teary-eyed after embracing their own outer beauty. Some women will always be more beautiful than others, just like men are. The only way to actually help women escape the \u201cbeauty trap\u201d is to simply make beauty less important\u2014just like it is for men. ||||| But even those ads are too ordinary to notice over time. So marketers also try to get creative with form. Here\u2019s one example. A public-transit staircase sits next to an escalator. The treads of the escalator are painted yellow, and the DHL brand mark is imprinted on the landing. Next to it, the word \u201cOtherServices\u201d is applied to the floor in blue and orange\u2014which just happen to be the colors of the FedEx logo. The implication is clear: DHL is faster than FedEx. \n \n Clever advertising by DHL pic.twitter.com/MxlqIIwaKz \u2014 Brilliant Ads (@Brilliant_Ads) May 7, 2017 \n \n Here\u2019s another. The wall of a bus shelter is encased in 3M Security Glass, which is also the product to be advertised. The wall appears to contain be hundreds of bundles of currency. The ad dares its subject to test the promise the product makes. \n \n This is how a security glass company shows their products are \"unbreakable\"! pic.twitter.com/8YPh3wALUq \u2014 Brilliant Ads (@Brilliant_Ads) April 26, 2017 \n \n In both of these cases, the ads work because they give consumers an experience of the product advertised. In the DHL ad, the comparison of the escalator and the stairs lets the consumer feel the speed differential. In the 3M Security Glass ad, the consumer almost can\u2019t help but accept the invitation to try to test the glass's durability. These advertisements mix reason and emotion, creating delight in coming to understand the product. \n \n And then there\u2019s the Dove Real Beauty Bottle. Like 3M and DHL, Dove aims to mix reason and emotion. The setup is right\u2014a product that embodies its message. But the problem is that the result is incoherent and contradictory. The bottles negate rather than support the advertiser\u2019s associative claims. \n \n Consider some scenarios. A pear-shaped woman has run out of body wash. She visits the local drug store, where she finds a display of Dove Real Beauty Bottles. To her chagrin, now she must choose between pear- and hourglass-shaped soap. She must also present this proxy for a body\u2014the one she has? the one she wishes she did?\u2014to a cashier to handle and perhaps to judge. What otherwise would have been a body-image-free trip to the store becomes a trip that highlights body-image. \n \n Now imagine actually using the bottles. In the shower, they become slippery. The pear shapes are unwieldy, all their weight pressed to the sides. That will make them hard to hold in a single-hand. The tall, thin bottles are gangly. They fall over easily when bumped on the shelf. \n \n Ah, but which bottle is least cumbersome? The hourglass-shaped bottles, of course. The ones with big \u201cbosoms\u201d and \u201chips,\u201d providing firm grip around the \u201cwaist\u201d when wet. And just like that, against the campaign\u2019s hopes, Dove engineered bottles that, through functional differences, inadvertently imply there is a best body after all. \n \n * * * \n \n Capitalism doesn\u2019t care about you. But usually it takes some work to uncover that truth. Dove is owned by the conglomerate Unilever, which also owns Axe. Axe makes the same kind of products Dove does, but markets them to young men, often in overtly sexist ways. That\u2019s a hypocrisy that reveals advertising\u2019s true scruples, which involve extracting incremental value from your wallet as efficiently as possible. But at least hiding the hypocrisy in the common ownership of a parent company also obscures it from the consumer\u2019s view. ||||| We know we\u2019re not alone in this \u2013 women around the world are using their influence to advance the real beauty debate, in their everyday lives and across social media. We\u2019ve been gifting these bottles to them as a \u2018thank you\u2019 (the range is not available to purchase). \n \n Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes. \n \n \n \n From curvaceous to slender, tall to petite, and whatever your skin colour, shoe size or hair type, beauty comes in a million different shapes and sizes. Our six exclusive bottle designs celebrate this diversity: just like women, we wanted to show that our iconic bottle can come in all shapes and sizes, too. \n \n \n \n \n \n Recent research from the Dove Global Beauty and Confidence Report revealed that one in two women feels social media puts pressure on them to look a certain way. Thankfully, many women are fighting with us to spread beauty confidence. Women using their influence to advance the real beauty debate across social media, and helping women embrace their own individuality as a source of confidence. ||||| Of course this is how it ends. \n \n Dove, friendly soap company and bastion of body-positive marketing, finally goes too far and literally engineers its packing to reflect the women to whom it markets. \n \n According to Dove: \n \n \"Each bottle evokes the shapes, sizes, curves and edges that combine to make every woman their very own limited edition. They\u2019re one of a kind\u2013just like you. But sometimes we all need reminding of that. \n \n Recent research from the Dove Global Beauty and Confidence Report revealed that one in two women feels social media puts pressure on them to look a certain way. Thankfully, many women are fighting with us to spread beauty confidence.\" \n \n And apparently the best way to make sure women are reminded daily of our special snowflakeness is to turn our soap bottles into literal reminders of our figures. Because bathing isn't just a time to get clean and enjoy a hot shower and some peace, but also to be, you know, empowered. By our soap bottles. \n \n We've reached out to Dove to ask a few of our most burning questions, including: \n \n Will the bottles all contain the same amount of soap? \n \n Do the body-positive cost bottles cost the same as normal ones, or will we pay a premium for our empowerment? \n \n How long will we be able to purchase these limited-edition keepsakes? \n \n Where in the world did this idea come from? \n \n The shade is already starting to roll in. \n \n @Dove Is this real?

Or is the benefit of the doubt something that simply doesn\u2019t exist for brands today? ||||| In an inspired packaging stunt, Ogilvy London has created a limited-edition set of Dove Body Wash bottles that come in various shapes and sizes, communication the brand\u2019s longtime celebration of body-diverse beauty. \n \n \u201cEvery woman\u2019s version of beauty is different, and if you ask us, these differences are there to be celebrated,\u201d Dove said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s what real beauty is all about\u2014the unique things that set us apart from each other and make us one of a kind. We\u2019ve championed this version of beauty for the past 60 years, and celebrated diverse women in our groundbreaking real beauty campaigns. But we wanted to bring this to life through our products, too.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe Real Beauty Bottles is one of those rare ideas which condenses decades of a brand\u2019s legacy in two seconds\u201d, said Andre (Dede) Laurentino, global executive creative director for Unilever at Ogilvy U.K. \u201cIt\u2019s deceivingly simple and quite nuanced: a message about our body conveyed by Dove bottles themselves, it cares for the physical and the emotional, and it brings brand essence and product design seamlessly together.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Dove's latest ad idea doesn't appear on its bottles\u2014it is the bottles. The company has rolled out \"limited edition\" body wash in the UK packaged in bottles of various shapes, the idea being that women come in various shapes, too. \"Every woman\u2019s version of beauty is different and, if you ask us, these differences are there to be celebrated,\" says a company statement on the Real Beauty Bottles campaign. (See a company video.) Unfortunately for Dove, reaction has been less than kind. At the Atlantic, Ian Bogost digs into the nuances of advertising to point out the campaign's failings. Among the points: Imagine a pear-shaped woman in a drug store having to choose between the bottles. \"She must also present this proxy for a body\u2014the one she has? the one she wishes she did?\u2014to a cashier to handle and perhaps to judge,\" he writes. \"What otherwise would have been a body-image-free trip to the store becomes a trip that highlights body image.\" Ditto the general sentiment at Quartz: This type of \"empowering advertising\" just winds up \"exploiting the very female insecurities that it claims to destroy,\" writes Annalisa Merelli. \"Well-intentioned or not, the message behind all of these campaigns is the same we\u2019ve always heard: Be beautiful.\" At AdWeek, however, Tim Nudd thinks it's an \"inspired packaging stunt,\" one in sync with Dove's theme of celebrating \"body-diverse beauty.\" The post includes a quote from creator Ogilvy UK saying it's \"one of those rare ideas which condenses decades of a brand\u2019s legacy in two seconds.\" And a post at Creativity has the ad among its top five \"brand ideas of the week.\" But that's the minority view. A Jezebel blogger puts the problem in question form: \"What doorway would you walk through if one was labeled 'Beautiful Bottle' and the other was labeled 'Average Bottle'?\" writes Aimee Lutkin. \"Until every woman sees herself as a beautiful bottle, Dove\u2019s lessons on #RealBeauty aren\u2019t over.\" Mashable blogger Alex Hazlett has some questions, including, \"Do the body-positive bottles cost the same as normal ones, or will we pay a premium for our empowerment?\" It's \"silly at best, condescending at worst,\" writes Kristen Bellstrom at Fortune. Companies that champion messages like this might occasionally do some good, but this is a reminder that these campaigns have but one real purpose: \"to sell you their stuff.\" New York rounds up mocking memes with a common theme: People choosing a different bottle that captures their essence, like one of those bear-shaped honey bottles. And Twitter is on fire with put-downs, including this gem: \"Can someone come over and help me measure my butt so I know which dove body wash to buy\"",

    "document": "A Southern California man has been charged with murder in the death of a 63-year-old woman who was mauled to death by a pack of pit bulls earlier this month. \n \n Alex Donald Jackson, 29, was arrested Thursday morning and charged with one count of murder in the fatal mauling of 63-year-old Pamela Devitt, who was out for a jog in the Mojave desert on May 9 when she was attacked. Passing motorists witnessed the mauling and called 911. \n \n \"When the deputy showed up, Dewitt was still alive. Paramedics thought she would live,\" Lt. John Corina of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Homicide Division told ABCNews.com. But she died on the way to the hospital, Corina said. \n \n An autopsy revealed that Devitt had died of blood loss attributed to sharp-force trauma. She sustained approximately 150 to 200 puncture wounds, Corina said. \n \n When an officer arrived at the scene, one of the dogs was still mauling Devitt, according to Corina. The deputy approached, and the dog ran off but soon turned around and came at the officer. He fired a shot, and the dog ran off again, only to turn around a moment later and come at the officer a second time. The officer fired a second shot, and the dog again took off, Corina said. \n \n Acting on information, sheriff' and animal-control officials obtained a warrant and searched Jackson's home, located about a block from the site of the attack. Eight dogs, six pit bulls and two mixed-breeds, were taken from the home. \n \n Jackson will be arraigned Friday at Los Angeles Superior Court, according to a statement from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. He's being held on $1 million bail. \n \n Deputy District Attorney Samantha MacDonald said that since January authorities had received at least three other reports of Jackson's pit bulls attacking people. \n \n Corina said that the fence around the property was only 3- to 4-feet feet high, and the dogs could easily hop over it. He said that police found other people who had similar stories, and area residents told ABC's Los Angeles station KABC-TV they feared the dogs. \n \n \"It's really scary,\" Diane Huffman told KABC-TV. \"I don't know what to think. I really think I'm going to be getting a gun to protect myself. \n \n \"They'd be walking past the house, and the dogs would attack them or their livestock, he said. \"In one instance, they were attacking a guy on a horse. [Jackson} encouraged it. When he tried to stop the dogs, [Jackson] threw rocks at him, and said to leave his dogs alone.\" \n \n Jackson, who allegedly ran a marijuana operation at his home, according to the Los Angeles County DA, was also charged with cultivating marijuana, possession of marijuana for sale, possession for sale of a controlled substance, and assault with a deadly weapon. \n \n Corina said that the dogs, which appear to be of varying ages, were all fully grown. He said that they were currently with the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Control, and would likely be euthanized. ||||| Pamela Devitt was taking a morning walk through her neighborhood earlier this month when a pack of pit bulls mauled her. \n \n The retired office manager suffered 150 to 200 puncture wounds in the fatal attack. When the first sheriff's deputy arrived on the scene in the Antelope Valley town of Littlerock, he saw Devitt on the ground with one of the dogs still mauling her. \n \n On Thursday, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office charged the dogs' owner with murder. Prosecutors could not recall ever filing a similar murder case, but said the incident warranted such serious charges because the owner's dogs had attacked others before mauling Devitt. \n \n DISCUSSION: Should dog owner face murder charge? \n \n District attorney spokeswoman Jane Robison said authorities had received at least three reports of attacks by dogs belonging to Alex Donald Jackson, 29, since January. \n \n \"We believe there was evidence that he was aware the dogs were vicious and they have attacked before and he knew of the danger they posed,\" Robison said. \n \n Jackson, who authorities say was growing marijuana in his home, was arrested Thursday and is being held on $1,050,000 bail. He is expected to be arraigned Friday. \n \n Devitt, 63, died en route to a hospital, and the attack sparked outrage in the neighborhood and beyond. Sheriff's officials said detectives found Devitt's blood on the muzzle and coats of four of Jackson's eight dogs. \n \n \"There's no way I can get the brutality of this out of my head,\" Devitt's husband, Ben Devitt, told The Times. \"The fact that there's animals out there roaming around with that kind of killer instinct, it's just kind of something I can't shake.\" \n \n Animal control officials took custody of Jackson's dogs. \n \n Murder cases involving dog attacks remain extremely rare, despite an increasing willingness by prosecutors throughout the country to file other types of charges, such as manslaughter and child endangerment, said Donald Cleary, a spokesman for the National Canine Research Council. The organization, which tracks dog attack cases, documented 34 dog-related fatalities last year. Six resulted in prosecutions; none involved murder charges. \n \n Cleary said fatal dog attacks tend to occur in outlying locations much like Littlerock, a desert community of about 1,400 where chain-link fences surround scattered homes and signs caution trespassers and warn that dogs are present. \n \n \"It happens on the fringes of society \u2014 where people live to avoid others,\" he said. \n \n Littlerock residents complained Thursday about stray dogs roaming the neighborhood. Kimberly Eslick, 29, said her cat was killed by a stray dog in the area. \n \n \"It doesn't surprise me at all,\" she said of Devitt's death, adding that she does not allow her kindergarten-age daughter out front alone anymore. \n \n Another resident, Jane Hammer, 60, said she carries a pistol with a hot-pink handle whenever she leaves the house as protection against bands of wild dogs she has seen in the area. \n \n The state's highest-profile dog-mauling murder case was tried in Los Angeles about a decade ago when a San Francisco judge moved a Bay Area case south in reaction to local outrage at the victim's death. In that case, a pair of Presa Canarios fatally mauled a woman in the hallway of her Pacific Heights apartment complex, leaving her with 77 bite marks. \n \n A Los Angeles jury convicted the dog's owner, Marjorie Knoller, of second-degree murder and her husband of involuntary manslaughter. A judge reduced Knoller's conviction to involuntary manslaughter, but the jury's verdict was reinstated following an appeal. \n \n To prove murder in a dog-mauling case, prosecutors must show that a dog owner knew the animal could endanger someone's life and acted in a way that showed a conscious disregard for that danger. The key is to show jurors that the animal's owner was previously warned that the animal was capable of killing, said Jim Hammer, who successfully prosecuted Knoller. \n \n \"What this case will turn on is the prior incidents,\" said Hammer, who is now in private practice and is not related to Jane Hammer. \"These are preventable deaths. I applaud any prosecutor who pursues such a case.\"",

(Apparently, it's enough of a difference to be noticeable to the naked eye: Last week, a reader wrote in to the Los Angeles Times complaining about a \"26% reduction in surface area.\") And, as Consumer Reports noted last year, the cardboard tubes are also increasing in diameter as the number of sheets per roll decreases.

Though toilet paper is essential\u2014Americans are estimated to use an average of 46 sheets per day, and that's probably not set to change any time soon\u2014paper towel and napkin sales are falling. In particular, large companies, like offices and restaurants, are moving toward things like air dryers or, the analyst explains, rationing how many napkins they dole out to customers. But they'll never cut down on their TP orders in an attempt to ration that particular product, so orders will remain steady. (As for those hand dryers, you might not want to use them.)",

    "document": "Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Democrats were gleeful this week when Donald Trump blurted out in Tuesday's debate that \u201cwages [are] too high.\u201d But as Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley prepare to debate Saturday night, the Democrats have a wage problem of their own: American incomes have dropped during the Obama presidency. \n \n It's a vulnerability that Republicans haven't figured out how to exploit, and it's clearly one of the biggest weaknesses in the Obama economic recovery. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n In 2014, the last year for which Census data are available, median household income was $1,656 lower than it was in January 2009, when President Barack Obama took office. A recent survey by the private firm Sentier Research showed household income finally rose this year above its level in June 2009, when the Great Recession ended \u2014 but only by 1.3 percent. That's a terrible record for any presidency. But that such stagnation occurred during a Democratic one is potentially a big problem for Democratic candidates, and especially for Clinton, who's running on her role in that administration. \n \n \u201cI think that there are two phenomena here,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, a senior strategist in Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign. \u201cThose who normally are the most articulate, passionate voices for those who are doing least well in the economy have been muted over the past seven years\u201d because they don\u2019t want to undercut Obama. That should create an opening for Republicans. \n \n But \u201cRepublicans have never been great at talking about this,\u201d Stevens said. \n \n The Republican candidates\u2019 wage conundrum isn\u2019t about excoriating the Democrats. They\u2019re all too happy to call out Obama for failing to lift incomes. \n \n \u201cThese last seven years,\u201d Bobby Jindal said at this week\u2019s GOP \u201cundercard\u201d debate, \u201cinequality has gone up. Only the top 10 percent have seen their incomes go up.\u201d Rick Santorum said not once, not twice, but three times that the middle class was \u201chollowing out.\u201d In the primetime debate that followed, Jeb Bush said \u201cthe disposable income of the great middle is down 2,300 bucks \u2026 Jobs are being created, but they\u2019re lower-income jobs than the jobs that were lost.\u201d \n \n But while the GOP candidates are eager to state the wages problem, they struggle to explain how they would fix it. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a bit awkward,\u201d says Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth, \u201cif Republicans are talking about the need for wage growth and opposed to a minimum wage increase.\u201d \n \n Only one of the Republican presidential candidates has endorsed a specific minimum-wage hike: Rick Santorum, who would raise the hourly minimum to $8.75, up from the current $7.25, over a period of three years. The Democratic field, meanwhile, proposes raising the minimum to $12 (Clinton) or $15 (Sanders, O\u2019Malley). \n \n Ben Carson expressed in the September CNN debate tentative support for an unspecified increase. He also said he favored a lower \u201cstarter\u201d minimum wage for young people. And Carson said the wage minimum should rise automatically with inflation \u201cso that we never have to have this conversation again.\u201d \n \n Romney also favored indexing the minimum wage, figuring, like Carson, that it would remove the topic permanently from the partisan arena. (Because the minimum wage is popular, politicizing it mostly hurts Republicans.) \u201cIt was a position [Romney] had as governor and a position he kept,\u201d Stevens said, \u201cand he ended up with a higher percentage of the GOP vote than Bush in 2000.\u201d (Actually, Romney muddied his support in 2012 by proposing the minimum be indexed not only to inflation but also to \u201cthe jobs level throughout the country, unemployment rate [and] competitive rates in other states, or, in this case, other nations.\u201d) \n \n But earlier this week Carson appeared to back away from his pro-minimum wage stance. \u201cI would not raise it,\u201d Carson said at Tuesday\u2019s debate, \u201cbecause I'm interested in making sure that people are able to enter the job market and take advantage of opportunities.\u201d \n \n The Carson campaign didn\u2019t answer POLITICO\u2019s request for clarification, but spokesman Doug Watts told the Daily Beast that Carson\u2019s position was unchanged. \u201cHis answer focused on the lower tier, which he does not believe needs raising, as it is an entry-level wage. He believes in a second, higher tier that, once determined, is indexed,\u201d Watts told the Daily Beast\u2019s Gideon Resnick in a post-debate email. \n \n The other Republican candidates all oppose raising the minimum wage, and two of them \u2014 Carly Fiorina and Jeb Bush \u2014 have indicated a preference for leaving the matter to the states. Then there's Trump, who since Tuesday has clarified that when he said wages were too high he was referring to the minimum wage, not to wages in general. (He did not propose lowering it.) \n \n Perhaps no candidate has underscored the Republicans\u2019 wage dilemma more than Marco Rubio. \u201cYou can\u2019t live on $10 an hour,\u201d Rubio said in October. \u201cYou can\u2019t live on $11 an hour.\u201d That would indicate, logically, that still less can one live on $7.25 an hour. But Rubio opposes raising the federal minimum. \n \n To Republicans, \u201craising the minimum wage is a Band Aid solution,\u201d explains Matthew Dickinson, a political scientist at Middlebury College. Lara Brown, a political scientist at George Washington University, says Republicans aren\u2019t necessarily wrong about that. \u201cThe Democratic solution is dealing with the minimum wage. But the vast majority of people in the country are not making the minimum wage.\u201d \n \n Instead, the Republican candidates favor stimulating the economy mainly through tax cuts and deregulation. But such policies yielded only modest growth in median household income under President Ronald Reagan, and a decline under President George W. Bush. Awareness has grown that sluggish wage growth is a long-term problem that's prevailed for four decades (excepting a period of brisk wage growth during the tech boom of the late 1990s). \n \n \u201cWages for the bottom 90 percent of the economy have been stagnant for 40 years,\u201d Mike Huckabee said at Tuesday\u2019s debate. Huckabee blamed the Federal Reserve. He favors a return to the gold standard, along with Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. But this position, long favored by many in the party\u2019s more conservative wing, has never stirred much excitement among voters. \n \n The most dramatic initiative that Obama has undertaken to intervene in the wage economy has earned almost no mention from the Republican field. That\u2019s the Labor Department\u2019s proposed rule to more than double (to $50,440) the threshold under which virtually all salaried employees would qualify for time-and-a-half pay if they worked more than 40 hours in a given week. \n \n The overtime rule, which is expected to increase by five million the number of workers eligible for overtime pay, was welcomed warmly by Clinton and especially by Sanders and O\u2019Malley. Congressional Republicans have denounced it as burdensome, echoing strong opposition by the business lobby. But the GOP\u2019s presidential candidates have been largely silent on the topic. \n \n \u201cIt will probably become an increasing topic of debate,\u201d said Dickinson, \u201cparticularly as the Labor department prepares for a final rule.\u201d But with a final rule now not expected until late in 2016, \u201cthis one\u2019s not close enough to fruition to become a target of attack.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Politico has an interesting article on what it's calling \"the Democrats' wage problem,\" a major takeaway of which is that the average American income has actually gone down during Obama's years as president. The median household income in 2014 was more than $1,600 lower than it was in January 2009, according to Census data. And while a recent survey says median household income is finally above its 2009 level this year, it's barely 1% above it. Politico calls this \"one of the biggest weaknesses in the Obama economic recovery\" and says it could be a big problem for Hillary Clinton since she was part of the administration. However Politico reports none of that is to say Republicans know how to fix stagnant wages or have even shown themselves able to capably address the issue. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit awkward if Republicans are talking about the need for wage growth and opposed to a minimum wage increase,\" one political scientist tells Politico.

    "document": "A San Francisco judge's scathing ruling ordering Wells Fargo to pay its customers $203 million for manipulating debit transactions to maximize overdraft fees might be just the start of troubles for the bank. \n \n U.S. District Judge William Alsup's 90-page opinion Tuesday described Wells Fargo's motive as profiteering and said the San Francisco-based bank's goal was to \"maximize the number of overdrafts and squeeze as much as possible\" out of customers. \n \n But the hefty tab represents only what Wells owes its California customers. That figure is far smaller than the potential bill from a separate suit in which Wells' clients in other states have accused the bank of the same unfair practices. \n \n That case, consolidated in federal court in Miami, includes similar claims against 30 other lending institutions, including Bank of America, Citibank, Chase, Union Bank and U.S. Bank. \n \n The crux of the claims is that the banks processed debit transactions from the largest to the smallest, instead of the order in which they occurred, depleting accounts faster and boosting the number of overdrafts, which cost as much as $35 per transaction. \n \n Billions in overdraft fees \n \n Wells Fargo garnered more than $1.4 billion in overdraft fees just in California from 2005 to 2007, according to court documents. Nationwide, banks and credit unions collected almost $24 billion in overdraft fees in 2008, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. \n \n Wells Fargo, which continues to follow the \"high-low\" practice that it has had in place since 1998, said it would appeal Alsup's decision. Wells representatives declined to forecast what the ruling might mean in the Florida matter, other than to say that the California order was not in line with the facts and that the bank's transactions have been \"consistent with the laws and rules of governing regulatory authorities.\" \n \n \"We have found that high-low gives priority to larger payments and have found that those are the customers' priority payments ... it gives priority to larger transactions,\" said Richele Messick, spokeswoman for Wells Fargo. \n \n Messick said that many transactions are received by the bank in a random order without a time stamp, and therefore, the bank needed to determine an order in which to process them. \n \n Effect on other case \n \n Richard Heimann, lead attorney for the Wells Fargo customers in California, also is representing plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit in Florida. \n \n Heimann said Alsup's order could affect the outcome of that case, even though the judge there is not legally bound to follow it. \n \n \"The decision may very well be influential because it was based on a well-regarded justice's review of a full evidentiary record,\" Heimann said. \"There's no doubt that the defendants' lawyers had been waiting to see the outcome of (the California) case and will be concerned about what it will portend for the case in Florida.\" \n \n Heimann noted that representatives from several banks named in the Florida suit sat in on the California court proceedings. \n \n The Florida action is not scheduled to go to trial until the fall of 2011, but its timeline is not affected by Wells Fargo's appeal of Alsup's decision. \n \n As part of his ruling Tuesday, Alsup also found that Wells' improper debit processing was exacerbated by the murky manner in which it explained the practice to customers. \n \n \"In shaping the reasonable expectations of its customers, the bank should have prominently disclosed its high-to-low scheme ...,\" Alsup wrote. \"`````````````The bank's 'disclosures' on posting order, however, were buried 20-or-so pages into a 60-plus-page document of single-spaced, ten-point font text.\" \n \n He proceeded to say that Wells' internal documents showed that the bank's practices were intentional and meant to generate profit. \n \n New regulations \n \n Alsup's decision comes just as new federal regulations are set to kick in. They will require banks to obtain customers' permission to provide overdraft protection. \n \n Historically, most banks have automatically provided the service, unless customers opt out. Now, customers who do not agree to the service - and its fees - won't be able to make purchases if they do not have sufficient funds. \n \n This article appeared on page A - 1 of the San Francisco Chronicle ||||| A federal judge in California ordered Wells Fargo & Co. to change what he called \"unfair and deceptive business practices\" that led customers into paying multiple overdraft fees, and to pay $203 million back to customers. \n \n In a decision handed down late Tuesday, U.S. District Judge William Alsup accused Wells Fargo of \"profiteering\" by changing its policies to process checks, debit card transactions and bill payments from the highest dollar amount to the lowest, rather than in the order the transactions took place. That helped drain customer bank accounts faster and drive up overdraft fees, a policy Alsup referred to as \"gouging and profiteering.\" \n \n Wells Fargo adopted the policies beginning in 2001, and they became widespread across the banking industry. It is unclear how the ruling would apply to the rest of the industry. \n \n The ruling detailed the experiences of two Wells Fargo customers who used their debit cards for multiple small purchases, and were then charged hundreds in overdraft fees because the order the purchases were cleared by the bank depended on the amounts. The judge found the customers, who were part of a class action, were not properly informed of the bank's policies on processing payments and were unaware the bank would allow debit purchases to go through when their accounts were overdrawn. \n \n \"Internal bank memos and e-mails leave no doubt that, overdraft revenue being a big profit center, the bank's dominant, indeed sole, motive was to maximize the number of overdrafts,\" Alsup wrote. That policy would \"squeeze as much as possible\" from customers with overdrafts, in particular from the 4 percent of customers who paid what he called \"a whopping 40 percent of its total overdraft and returned-item revenue.\" \n \n The judge dismissed Wells Fargo's arguments that customers wanted and benefited from the policies, and detailed evidence he said showed efforts to obscure the practices in statements and other materials. Wells Fargo's online banking system, for example, would display pending purchases in chronological order, \"leading customers to believe that the processing would take place in that order.\" \n \n \"The supposed net benefit of high-to-low resequencing is utterly speculative,\" he wrote. \"Its bone-crushing multiplication of additional overdraft penalties, however, is categorically assured.\" \n \n Alsup also criticized the bank for allowing overdraft purchases after accounts had been drained by offering a \"shadow line of credit\" that customers were unaware existed. \n \n The decision noted that the Federal Reserve has outlawed some of the practices detailed in the case, most notably debit card overdrafts permitted without customers agreeing to accept overdraft protection. \n \n Judge Alsup ordered Wells Fargo to stop posting transactions in high-to-low order by Nov. 30 and to reverse overdraft fees charged to customers from Nov. 15, 2004, to June 30, 2008, as a result of the policy. A study cited in the decision by a Wells Fargo witness put the restitution at \"close to $203 million.\" \n \n Wells Fargo spokeswoman Richele Messick said the bank is \"disappointed\" with the ruling. \"We don't believe the ruling is in line with the facts of this case and we plan to appeal,\" she said. \n \n Messick noted that Wells Fargo changed its policies earlier this year, and customers can no longer incur more than four overdraft charges in one day. \n \n Wells Fargo shares closed Wednesday trading down $1.47, or 5.3 percent, at $26.30, as the broader markets dropped sharply on economic concerns, with banks being particularly hard hit. \n \n The case, heard in the U.S. District Court for Northern California, is Gutierrez vs. Wells Fargo. \n \n (This version CORRECTS Corrects spelling of spokeswoman's name to Richele sted Rochele.)",

    "document": "On His Way to Speak At FBI, Trump Slams The Bureau And Opens Door To Pardoning Flynn \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Evan Vucci/AP Evan Vucci/AP \n \n President Trump, minutes before heading to speak at the FBI's National Academy, lashed out at the bureau, saying, \"It's a shame what's happened with the FBI\" and claiming there are \"a lot of very angry people that are seeing it.\" \n \n Speaking to reporters on the White House lawn, Trump said, \"We're going to rebuild the FBI\" after what he described as \"really, really disgraceful\" documents. He appeared to be referring to text messages the Justice Department provided Congress this week in which a senior agent described candidate Trump as an \"idiot\" and made other political remarks in the course of the presidential campaign. \n \n Trump's comments are the latest in a barrage of criticism he has directed at the FBI. Earlier this month, he declared on Twitter that the bureau's reputation is \"in Tatters \u2014 worst in History!\" \n \n That assessment came days after special counsel Robert Mueller, who is leading the Russia investigation, secured a guilty plea from Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn. \n \n Trump opened the door Friday to pardoning Flynn. \n \n \"I don't want to talk about pardons with Michael Flynn \u2014 yet,\" Trump said. \"We'll see what happens. Let's see.\" \n \n Flynn has not been sentenced and appears to be a cooperating witness as part of Mueller's Russia probe. Trump called the investigation a \"Democrat hoax,\" \"an excuse for losing the election\" and claimed again \"there is absolutely no collusion.\" \n \n toggle caption Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images \n \n Later, White House lawyer Ty Cobb said, \"There is no consideration at the White House of a pardon for Michael Flynn.\" \n \n Trump's remarks on his way to Quantico, Va., carried new potency given the president's audience Friday morning: the latest graduating class at the FBI's National Academy for law enforcement managers. \n \n In his speech, the president refrained from attacking the FBI. He made only passing references to the bureau in his remarks before U.S. and international law enforcement officers who were graduating from a program at the FBI's prestigious training center. \n \n Instead, Trump's speech focused on his \"law and order\" agenda, and he echoed comments Attorney General Jeff Sessions has frequently made since Inauguration Day: The administration backs the police. \n \n \"With me as your president, America's police will have a true friend and loyal champion in the White House. More loyal that anyone else can be,\" Trump said. \"You very rarely get the recognition you deserve.\" \n \n He promised to work with law enforcement to crack down on drug cartels and gangs, such as MS-13, whose members he referred to as \"savages.\" \n \n \"We'll get rid of them completely, very soon, right?\" Trump said as he turned and pointed to Sessions. \"To any member of MS-13 listening: We will find you; we will arrest you; we will jail you; we will throw you the hell out of the country.\" \n \n While Trump refrained from criticizing the FBI in his speech, his comments earlier in the day hung over his appearance in Quantico \u2014 and dominated TV news coverage leading up to his address. \n \n That is because it's unusual for a president to blast the bureau \u2014 the premier law enforcement agency in the country. \n \n In fact, over the past 15 years, it has been the other way around. President Barack Obama famously visited bureau headquarters a few months after he took office in 2009, donning an FBI baseball cap and sharing \"the thanks of a grateful nation.\" A year earlier, President George W. Bush praised \"the character and courage of those who carry the badge.\" \n \n The appearance at the FBI had already promised to be complicated for Trump, given his record of derogatory public statements and negative tweets about the FBI this year. \n \n Recently, Trump tweeted that the FBI's reputation was in \"Tatters - worst in History!\" He called popular former FBI Director James Comey, whom he fired in May, \"a liar\" and \"a leaker.\" Trump also accused the FBI, without providing any evidence, of illegally wiretapping Trump Tower in 2016. And he continues to cast doubt on a conclusion by the bureau and other intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in last year's presidential election. \n \n On Friday morning, Trump reaffirmed to reporters, \"there is absolutely no collusion. I didn't make a phone call to Russia. I have nothing to do with Russia. Everybody knows it. That was a Democrat hoax. It was an excuse for losing the election.\" \n \n Another source of awkwardness: the FBI's longtime former leader, Mueller, is the man running the ongoing special counsel probe into election interference \u2014 and into whether anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign took part. So far, Mueller's team has secured indictments against Paul Manafort, Trump's onetime campaign chairman, and won guilty pleas from a campaign foreign policy official and Flynn. \n \n That last development, on Dec. 1, prompted a new wave of attacks from Trump and his supporters on the integrity of the FBI and the Justice Department, fueled by the disclosure that the Justice Department Inspector General had uncovered text messages in which a senior agent working on the Russia probe had called Trump an \"idiot\" during the campaign. \n \n While Mueller removed the agent from the investigation months ago, one of Trump's lawyers, Jay Sekulow, has cited the matter to call for a second special counsel to investigate conflicts of interest at the bureau. \n \n In response to a stream of harsh criticism this month, the FBI Agents Association mounted a rare public defense. \n \n \"Every day, FBI special agents put their lives on the line to protect the American public from national security and criminal threats,\" President Tom O'Connor tweeted. \"Agents perform their duties with unwavering integrity and professionalism and a focus on complying with the law and the Constitution. This is why the FBI continues to be the premier law enforcement agency in the world.\" \n \n Trump's pick to lead the FBI, former Justice Department official Christopher Wray, also raised his voice to defend the workforce in congressional testimony last week. \n \n \"Let me start by saying that it is for me the honor of a lifetime to be here representing the men and women of the FBI,\" Wray said. \"There is no finer institution than the FBI and no finer people than the men and women who work there and are its very beating heart.\" \n \n Trump appeared on stage with Wray to welcome the new class of National Academy graduates at what is known as the agency's \"police training center.\" \n \n The program puts attendees through a series of academic and physical challenges, building partnerships between police and the FBI. Nearly 10 years ago, Mueller told an FBI graduating class at Quantico, \"For the past 100 years, the FBI has stood for the best of America.\" \n \n It remains to be seen whether the new president agrees. ||||| President Donald Trump gestures to the crowd at the FBI National Academy graduation ceremony, Friday, Dec. 15, 2017, in Quantico, Va.

Why won't Southwest stop kicking people off flights for reasons even the airline will admit are over-the-top? \n \n Although Avital was told she wouldn't be able to fly if she didn't button up her flannel shirt, she bravely bared her breasts all the way onto the plane. \"I didn't want to let the representative's Big Feelings about my breasts change the way I intended to board my flight,\" she explained. \"And lo and behold, the plane didn't fall out of the sky...my cleavage did not interfere with the plane's ability to function properly.\" Imagine that! \n \n Advertisement \n \n Check out Avital's early morning flying attire; pretty casual, right? (And cute, which is impressive, given that she probably woke up before daybreak.) She wasn't exactly verging into XXX territory with her rope belt and Birkenstock-y sandals. Is it really inappropriate for a self-described large-chested woman to wear a non-constricting sundress on a 100-degree day? More to the point: is it really the airline's responsibility to dictate what is and isn't appropriate apparel? \"To add insult to injury, the guy sitting in front of me on the plane was wearing a shirt with an actual Trojan condom embedded behind a clear plastic applique and had no trouble getting on his flight,\" Avital added. \"Slut shaming, pure and simple.\" We'd have to agree. \n \n Southwest spokesperson Christi McNeill told us that the company offered Avital an apology and a refund \"as a gesture of goodwill,\" but that their Contract of Carriage allows them to refuse to transport a customer whose clothing is lewd, obscene, or patently offensive. \"As a Company that promotes a casual and family-focused atmosphere onboard our aircraft and in our airports, we simply ask that our Customers use good judgment and exercise discretion in deference to other Customers who depend on us to provide a comfortable travel experience,\" she explained after I asked her how customers should dress for Southwest flights so they're not publicly humiliated and/or prohibited from boarding. \"Our Flight Crews and Employees are responsible for the safety and comfort of everyone onboard the flight.\" \n \n Advertisement \n \n A Brief History of Southwest Humiliation \n \n Southwest Airlines has become synonymous with people getting kicked off flights for ridiculous reasons. Avital is not the first woman to be deemed too slutty-looking to fly; according to Southwest's history, cleavage is not \"family-friendly,\" even though today's median bra size in the US is 36DD. There's Kyla Ebbert, who was escorted off a flight by a Southwest customer service supervisor who called her outfit \"inappropriate\" back in 2007, even though she looked like any SoCal resident dressed for 106-degree weather, maybe one having a particularly conservative day. A week later, Setara Qassim was forced to wear a blanket by a Southwest flight attendant who thought Setara's top was too low cut. Hey, Southwest: it's difficult \u2014 not to mention uncomfortable \u2014 to completely cover yourself up if you have larger breasts. What's family-friendly about making your customers feel both emotionally and physically shitty about themselves? \n \n Advertisement \n \n Then there are the multiple people who Southwest felt were too fat to fly, most notoriously Kevin Smith, who tweeted nearly 200 times to his then 1.6 million followers after being told he was a \"safety risk\" due to his size. Most recently, Kenlie Tiggerman sued the airline in hopes of pressuring them to enact rules barring flight attendants from determining whether or not an obese passenger has to purchase a second seat. \"If you're telling me I have to buy two seats, you should tell me at the point of purchase, not the day I'm flying when I check in at the terminal,\" she said. \n \n If Southwest is legally forced to change their weight policies, will that stop them from kicking people off their flights who are \"too emotional\" to fly, too vaguely terrorist-y to fly, or, in the case of The L Word's Leisha Hailey, who was kicked off a flight for kissing her girlfriend, too gay to fly? Lest you think they haven't managed to cover all of their bases, the airline once kicked Greenday's Billie Joe Armstrong off a flight for wearing baggy pants. Maybe Southwest Airlines should really be called \"Stepford Airlines.\" Or maybe they should just stop letting their employees judge what's \"family-friendly\" based on vague standards that aren't even officially mandated by the company. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Hey, Southwest: Sorry Won't Cut It Anymore \n \n Southwest eventually apologized and offered refunds to many of the customers in the cases listed above, but that's because they were either celebrities or spoke out about the situation; who knows how often people who are too embarrassed to come forward get kicked off flights for not living up to Southwest employees' morals? Doesn't it send mixed messages to say \"sorry\" but still reserve the right to boot people who don't promote the \"casual and family-focused atmosphere\"? Why won't Southwest publish a dress code on their website? I asked those questions multiple times, but just received different variations on this: \n \n Our Employees are extensively trained to use their best judgment and exercise discretion when handling any Customer issues or concerns. Regarding what to wear when flying Southwest \u2014 We simply ask that our Customers use also use good judgment and exercise discretion in deference to other Customers who depend on us to provide a comfortable travel experience. \n \n Advertisement \n \n That's no consolation for Avital, who told us she'll never fly Southwest again but wishes there was a way to make sure other people don't go through the same embarrassing experience. \"It seems like only people who raise a big stink get an apology,\" she said. \"What I want to avoid is being subject to individual employee's whims. There's no official channel at Southwest to make sure that doesn't happen.\" ||||| Woman claims Southwest wouldn't let her board plane because of her cleavage: report Man with condom on his shirt didn't have a problem, female flyer fumes \n \n A woman told the blog Jezebel that a Southwest worker told her she couldn't fly unless she covered up her cleavage. \n \n Southwest Airlines was forced to apologize to a woman who was told she couldn't board her flight because her cleavage was \"inappropriate.\" \n \n Jezebel reports that the woman, Avital \u2014 she only gave her first name \u2014 was boarding a 6 a.m. flight from Las Vegas to New York on June 5 when a ticket agent remarked that she couldn't fly unless she covered her breasts. \n \n Clad in a comfy cotton dress, a baggy flannel shirt and bright scarf, Avital ignored the warning and marched aboard anyway. \n \n \"I didn't want to let the representative's Big Feelings about my breasts change the way I intended to board my flight,\" she told Jezebel. \n \n \"And lo and behold, the plane didn't fall out of the sky... my cleavage did not interfere with the plane's ability to function properly.\" \n \n Avital slammed the Southwest for \"slut shaming,\" and said a man on her flight had on a provocative piece of clothing, but wasn't hassled. \n \n \"The guy sitting in front of me on the plane was wearing a shirt with an actual Trojan condom embedded behind a clear plastic applique and had no trouble getting on his flight,\" she said. \n \n A Southwest spokesperson told Jezebel that the airline apologized to Avital for the flap and offered her a refund. \n \n Company policy allows agents to turn away passengers they feel are dressed inappropriately, the spokesperson said. \n \n Southwest has a history with rubbing plus-sized passengers the wrong way. \n \n Last month, New Orleans political strategist and weightloss blogger Kenlie Tiggerman sued the airline after she claimed a ticket agent told her to buy a second seat because she was too fat to fit into one.",

    "document": "Saturn's biggest ring just broke its own record. Scientists have found that the planet's Phoebe ring is more than twice the thickness once thought \u2013 even though it can\u2019t be seen with the human eye. \n \n The study, published in the journal Nature, also finds that this oversized ring is made mostly of tiny particles. The findings could shed fresh light on the evolution of the Saturnian ring system. \n \n \u201cI was giving talks saying Saturn has a giant invisible ring, which makes you sound just perfectly crazy,\u201d said lead author Douglas Hamilton, a planetary scientist at the University of Maryland, College Park. \u201cIt is 10 to 20 times larger than the second-biggest ring, so this thing is absolutely gargantuan.\u201d \n \n Many of Saturn\u2019s rings seem to hug the planet, forming the beautiful striped disc for which the gas giant is so well known. But in 2009, NASA\u2019s infrared-sensing Spitzer Space Telescope picked up another ring so large that the entire planet and its main rings appear as a small dot in the middle. \n \n The ring is difficult to detect in visible light (NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft did so a few years later), but it can be clearly seen as a ghostly halo at infrared wavelengths. \n \n Hamilton and colleagues first went looking for this \"giant invisible ring\" because of the strange two-tone coloring of Iapetus, one of Saturn\u2019s moons. One side is pale, but the other side of the moon is dark, as if covered with soot. The scientists theorized that unseen particles from farther out were hitting Iapetus and blackening one side. (Iapetus is tidally locked with Saturn and can't rotate fast enough to get an all-around coating.) \n \n \u201cIf that material was coming inward and coating the face of Iapetus, then maybe we could see the ring,\u201d Hamilton said, and the team started searching. \u201cUsually those things don\u2019t pay off, but this one did.\u201d \n \n At the time, they estimated that the ring stretched from 4.8 million to 7.76 million miles, though with Spitzer's relatively narrow field of view, they couldn't say how thick it really was. \n \n Now, with NASA\u2019s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer telescope, they have found that it stretches from about 3.75 million to 10.1 million miles \u2013 a little beyond Phoebe, a far-out moon that is the same color as the stuff in the ring, and is probably the source for the dark material. \n \n While the Phoebe ring is enormous, the particles within are surprisingly tiny \u2013 the scientists estimate that the vast majority of them, roughly 90%, are smaller than the size of a soccer ball. \n \n Understanding why the particle size distribution is so skewed could offer researchers \u201ca window into the history of the Saturn system,\u201d Hamilton said. \n \n Follow @aminawrite for more science news. ||||| WISE Band 4 mosaic of the Phoebe ring. a, Individual WISE frames manually combined: scattered light from Saturn forms the large white overexposed blob with a black centre while four diagonal diffraction spikes radiate outward.

Credit: (c) Nature 522, 185\u2013187 (11 June 2015) doi:10.1038/nature14476 (Phys.org)\u2014A small team of researchers with members affiliated with the University of Maryland, the University of Virginia and Caltech, has found that the outermost ring of Saturn is much bigger than had been previously thought. In their paper published in the journal Nature, the team describes how they studied the ring using an infrared telescope and what they believe caused its immense size to come about. \n \n Back in 2009, a team of researchers working with NASA's infrared Spitzer Space Telescope discovered that there was an outer ring circling Saturn that had not been known to exist\u2014made mostly of extremely tiny dark dust particles, the ring was difficult to see. They estimated at the time that the ring was likely over two hundred times the radius of its host planet. In this new effort, the researchers studied images taken from NASA's WISE probe, which has also been taking infrared pictures. Those pictures, the team reports, suggest the ring is actually over 270 times the radius of Saturn, which mean it stretches from almost four million miles from the planet to just over ten million miles, making it approximately ten times the size of the E ring, until this new discovery, Saturn's largest ring. Putting it into perspective, if Saturn were merely the size of a basketball, this new outer ring would extend nearly two thirds the length of a football field away from it. \n \n The ring has only been revealed by infrared cameras because the dust particles in it absorb heat from the sun\u2014such particles the researchers report are extremely small, just microns in size. They also report that there are some other much larger, though far less in number particles, some as large as soccer balls. Because of the huge distance between the ring and planet, the researchers theorize that the material in the ring is probably very old, perhaps in the billions of years. They also suspect the tiny particles are material ejected from the distant moon Phoebe. \n \n Prior to the discovery of Saturn's largest ring, it was believed material ejected from moons at such a distance would coalesce into a new moon, rather than form a ring\u2014now it appears such theories will have to be rethought. Also, because of similarities between Saturn's moons and Jupiter's moons, the researchers suspect Jupiter likely has a massive unseen ring around it as well. \n \n Explore further: Image: Groovy rings of Saturn \n \n More information: Small particles dominate Saturn's Phoebe ring to surprisingly large distances, Nature 522, 185\u2013187 (11 June 2015) DOI: 10.1038/nature14476 \n \n Abstract \n \n Saturn's faint outermost ring, discovered in 2009 (ref. 1), is probably formed by particles ejected from the distant moon Phoebe2, 3. The ring was detected1 between distances of 128 and 207 Saturn radii (RS = 60,330 kilometres) from the planet, with a full vertical extent of 40RS, making it well over ten times larger than Saturn's hitherto largest known ring, the E ring. The total radial extent of the Phoebe ring could not, however, be determined at that time, nor could particle sizes be significantly constrained. Here we report infrared imaging of the entire ring, which extends from 100RS out to a surprisingly distant 270RS. We model the orbital dynamics of ring particles launched from Phoebe, and construct theoretical power-law profiles of the particle size distribution. We find that very steep profiles fit the data best, and that elevated grain temperatures, arising because of the radiative inefficiency of the smallest grains, probably contribute to the steepness. By converting our constraint on particle sizes into a form that is independent of the uncertain size distribution, we determine that particles with radii greater than ten centimetres, whose orbits do not decay appreciably inward over 4.5 billion years, contribute at most about ten per cent to the cross-sectional area of the ring's dusty component. \n \n ||||| Rings around planets are supposed to stay close to home, as any Astro 101 textbook will tell you. Once they venture too far afield from their gravitational overlord, conventional astronomical wisdom dictates that they will collapse and form new satellites. \n \n \u201cThat does a really good job of explaining rings\u2014except for this one,\u201d says Douglas Hamilton, an astrophysicist at the University of Maryland. Hamilton and colleagues describe Saturn\u2019s biggest, strangest, most recently-discovered ring in a study published today in Nature. The so-called Phoebe ring is not only bigger than the researchers thought, it appears to be made of unusually fine particles\u2014particles that continually collide with Saturn\u2019s moon Iapetus as it circles the planet, turning the moon\u2019s leading face black. \n \n Hamilton was part of the team that discovered the Phoebe ring in 2009, with help from the Spitzer Space Telescope. They wouldn\u2019t have found it except for that weird pattern on Iapetus\u2019 surface: one face an icy white, the other inky black. Like Earth\u2019s own moon, Iapetus keeps one constant face toward its planet. So one side\u2014the darkened one\u2014is forever leading the charge through space. Phoebe, a dark-as-coal moon further away from Saturn than Iapetus, was the second piece of the puzzle. \n \n \u201cYou can imagine something big smashed into Phoebe a billion years ago, and all of this debris was flung out,\u201d Hamilton says. When he calculated how long it would take for this debris to be cleaned up (either by collapsing into a new satellite or to fall to Saturn) he found that it would take a shockingly long time: about 10 billion years. That\u2019s longer than the solar system has existed. \u201cWe realized that all of the debris coating the face of Iapetus, that didn\u2019t happen long ago. It\u2019s going on now,\u201d he says. So his team started searching for the source of the material painting the moon black. \u201cFinding it was really gratifying.\u201d \n \n That was six years ago. Back then, when his team first wrote about their findings, the only available data on this vanishingly faint ring came in the form of a small cross-section. For Hamilton the picture felt \u201cnot much bigger than a postage stamp.\u201d Now, using data from NASA\u2019s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer spacecraft launched in 2009, they\u2019ve gathered a complete view of Phoebe\u2019s enormous ring. \u201cIt was immense beforehand, and we just made it even bigger,\u201d Hamilton says. \n \n The Phoebe ring, they now know, is 30 percent larger than previous estimates, covering a section of sky equal to more than 500 times the size of Saturn. That makes it the largest ring\u2014and possibly the slowest developing\u2014ever discovered. \u201cThe thing that makes this unique is that, because it\u2019s far from the planet, time scales are really slow,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cAnything that comes off Phoebe just stays out there.\u201d \n \n No other rings like this have been found, though theoretically they may exist. Jack Lissauer, a planetary scientist at NASA Ames, says that although the evidence is strong that much of the material in the ring comes from Phoebe, he\u2019d like to see closer imaging: Perhaps some of Saturn\u2019s more distant satellites (the planet has 53 moons in total) are contributing material as well. \n \n Phoebe\u2019s ring is \u201cfantastically faint,\u201d in the words of Luke Dones, astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute. While its mere detection is impressive, it may also point the way toward understanding debris disks around other stars, which could contain unseen planets. Even in our own solar system, Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune may have similar, albeit fainter and more spread out, rings. \u201cThere we expect much wider rings,\u201d Hamilton says. \u201cMaybe ring isn\u2019t even the right word anymore. Maybe we should call them clouds. Those are much harder to detect and convince yourself that they\u2019re real.\u201d \n \n For Hamilton, the Phoebe ring\u2019s quirks are is a reminder that the universe still holds a lot of surprises. \u201cWe see it over and over again with exoplanets where you find them doing something you\u2019d never expect, just because planets in our solar system don\u2019t do that,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is another reminder that there are lots of mysteries out there\u2014we don\u2019t understand everything yet.\u201d",

The police intervened, and as one regent left, about 100 students clustered around him, yelling \u201cShame on you!\u201d \n \n Mark Yudof, the university president, said the state budget cuts had left the university no choice but to raise fees, and noted that the system received only half as much, per student, from the state as it did in 1990. \n \n \u201cMy biggest fear,\u201d Mr. Yudof said, \u201cis an exodus of faculty.\u201d \n \n At U.C.L.A. on Wednesday, 14 demonstrators, including 12 students, were arrested for disrupting the Regents meeting. Some demonstrators barricaded themselves inside Campbell Hall, where they spent Wednesday night; others spent the night in tent cities on campus. \n \n Rodrigo Verdugo, 18, a freshman at Cal State San Marcos and the first in his family to go to college, carried a sign that said \u201cno fee hikes.\u201d He said he worried that if his parents, migrant farm workers from Mexico, could not afford state university fees, his younger siblings \u201cmight have to work in the fields, too, if this becomes so expensive.\u201d \n \n Standing next to him, Maria Isabel Rocha mentioned ways the budget cuts were already being felt. \u201cThe library has cut hours, we can\u2019t print, staff have been furloughed and T.A.s have been cut,\u201d she said, referring to teaching assistants. \u201cSo there is less instruction and less office hours, but we\u2019re still responsible for the same amount of material.\u201d \n \n Ms. Rocha, 19, said she already worked two jobs, and higher fees would mean taking on another. \u201cI might have to take a quarter off to make money to afford tuition,\u201d she said. ||||| Amid loud student protests that roiled the UCLA campus, the UC Board of Regents this afternoon approved a 32% increase in student fees. \n \n The fee hike of $2,500, or 32%, will come in two steps by next fall. That would bring the basic UC education fees to about $10,300, plus about another $1,000 for campus-based charges, for a total that would be about triple the UC cost a decade ago. Room, board and books can add another $16,000. \n \n Only student regent Jesse Bernal voted against the undergraduate fees. \n \n The noise of protesters came through the window as the regents voted. It was only lightly discussed, with UC President Mark G. Yudof urging that students explore all the financial-aid possibilities so they don\u2019t get scared away or drop out. \n \n Groups of UC students from several other campuses arrived in Westwood to join a demonstration against the fee hike, and a group of protesters was occupying a UCLA classroom building. \n \n UCLA officials declared Campbell Hall, where the sit-in continued, closed for the day. Inside, about 40 to 50 students who had chained the doors shut shortly after midnight were issuing e-mail statements. \n \n \u201cWe choose to fight back, to resist, where we find ourselves, the place where we live and work, our university,\u201d their statement said. Campus police surrounded the classroom building, but no arrests were made.",

Pollizi, who recently began filming a reality spin-off of the Jersey Shore with costar and friend Jenni Farley in my hometown of Jersey City, NJ, is experiencing what millions of single American women will go through this year: the weighty iron wrench that a bambino throws into even the best-laid plans for life, career, relationships, you name it. \n \n According to recent reporting in the NYTimes, the fastest-growing group of new moms are young, single women. \u201cMore than half of births to American women under 30 occur outside marriage,\u201d Sabrina Tavernise writes, \u201cIt used to be called illegitimacy. Now it is the new normal.\u201d \n \n Only in Snooki\u2019s case, we get to watch it play out in the tabloids. And in terms of her career, it\u2019s a much bigger, heavier and potentially more destructive wrench. See, the 4\u20199\u201d star has built her name upon her Jersey Shore antics\u2014skipping work, flashing her panties, getting arrested\u2014most often with the lubrication of liquor. She\u2019s lined her pockets with endorsement deals for energy drinks and diet pills\u2014definite no-no\u2019s for a mommy-to-be. \n \n It would be easy to say that Snooki\u2019s troubles\u2014should this baby turn out to be true\u2014are worlds away from those of your run-of-the-mill (read: non reality star) pregnant 24-year-old. But the truth is that her issues are just heightened versions of the same. Will she be able to provide for her child? Likely, although it depends on whether she\u2019s hired a real-deal wealth manager or if she\u2019s squandering her $100K an episode on leopard print and spray tans. Will her career plans survive this unexpected baby-bump in the road? If she can convince producers that her labor should be televised, then maybe. And in the end, will Snooki be a good mother? \n \n While the premise of the new series, rumored to be titled \u201cSnooki and JWoww v. The World,\u201d is still unknown, it\u2019s easy to imagine producers thought it would follow suit: on the pair\u2019s first weekend in Jersey City they celebrated Jenni \u201cJWoww\u201d Farley\u2019s 26th birthday at O\u2019Connell\u2019s Bar by renting out a full floor for partying. For her part, Polizzi\u2019s told the press that it won\u2019t be all vodka and club-hopping this season. \u201cWe want it to be different than \u2018Jersey Shore,\u2019 so it\u2019s not always going to the club, drinking and partying,\u201d she told US Weekly. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019m going to be on my own for real. You\u2019ve only seen the party side of us.\u201d \n \n On her own, or drinking for two? Reps for both Polizzi and 495 Productions, which produces the show in addition to Jersey Shore, did not respond to phonecalls, but given the delayed production schedule, it\u2019s worth speculating that it was Snooki\u2019s big news that slowed things down, not the conflicts over locations that were fed to the press. Were production assistant scrambling for set pieces to hide the bump as it grows over the six weeks of filming? \n \n According to the unnamed sources in Wednesday\u2019s Post, Snooki is one step ahead of everyone, plotting to parlay the wrench of an unexpected pregnancy into (yet another) media moment: she\u2019s allegedly brokered a deal to announce her pregnancy on the cover of US Weekly. We\u2019ll just have to wait and see if 495 Productions and their cameras are in on the fun. \n \n What do you think? If Snooki told 495 bigwig Sally Ann Salsano that she was in a family way, did Salsano see red\u2014or only dollar signs? ||||| IS THERE A TEST FOR FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME AT THREE MONTHS IN UTERO? Sources tell the New York Post that perpetual party girl is preggers but keeping the news under wraps so she can sell it to a tabloid. Check out What To Expect When Snooki's Expecting: The Fallout On Jersey Shore \n \n Jersey Shore's breakout star -- and by that we don't mean herpes -- is currently filming her spinoff series with Jenni \"JWoww\" Farley in Jersey City. \n \n \n \n Star reported several weeks ago that Snookums was pregnant, but the diminutive star with the loud persona denied those claims on GMA on Feb. 2. \n \n \n \n Snooki's obviously ambivalent boyfriend, Jionni LaValle, is speculated to be the father.

For other uses, see FASD (disambiguation) \n \n Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy.[1] Problems may include an abnormal appearance, short height, low body weight, small head size, poor coordination, low intelligence, behavior problems, and problems with hearing or seeing.[1][2] Those affected are more likely to have trouble in school, legal problems, participate in high-risk behaviors, and have trouble with alcohol or other drugs.[7] The most severe form of the condition is known as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS).[1] Other types include partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS), alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD).[1][8] Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types.[9] \n \n Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are caused by drinking alcohol during pregnancy.[1] Surveys from the United States have found about 10% of pregnant women have drunk alcohol in the last month, and 20% to 30% drank at some point during the pregnancy.[10] About 4.7% of North American women who are pregnant are alcoholics.[11] The risk of problems depends on the amount consumed and the frequency of consumption as well as when during pregnancy the alcohol is consumed.[10] Other risk factors include an older mother, smoking, and poor diet.[12][10] There is no known safe amount or safe time to drink during pregnancy.[1][13] While drinking small amounts of alcohol does not cause abnormalities in the face, it may cause behavioral issues.[11] Alcohol crosses the blood brain barrier and both directly and indirectly affects a developing baby.[14] Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in the person.[1] \n \n Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are preventable by avoiding alcohol.[4] For this reason, medical authorities recommend no alcohol during pregnancy or while trying to become pregnant.[15][16][17] While the condition is permanent, treatment can improve outcomes.[1][3] Interventions may include parent-child interaction therapy, efforts to modify child behavior, and possibly medications.[5] \n \n FASD is estimated to affect between 2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe.[6] FAS is believed to occur in between 0.2 and 9 per 1000 live births in the United States.[6] In South Africa, some populations have rates as high as 9%.[8] The negative effects of alcohol during pregnancy have been described since ancient times.[8] The lifetime cost per child with FAS was $2,000,000 in 2002 in the US.[6] The term fetal alcohol syndrome was first used in 1973.[8] \n \n Types [ edit ] \n \n FASDs encompass a range of physical and neurodevelopmental problems that can result from prenatal alcohol exposure.[1] The most severe condition is called fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS),[1] which refers to individuals who have a specific set of birth defects and neurodevelopmental disorders characteristic of the diagnosis.[18] \n \n Some accept only FAS as a diagnosis, seeing the evidence as inconclusive with respect to other types.[9] Partial fetal alcohol syndrome (pFAS) refers to individuals with a known, or highly suspected, history of prenatal alcohol exposure who have alcohol-related physical and neurodevelopmental deficits that do not meet the full criteria for FAS.[18] The subtypes of pFAS are alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD).[18] In addition to FAS, pFAS, ARND, and ARBD, any other conditions believed to be related to prenatal alcohol exposure, such as spontaneous abortion and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), are also considered to be on the spectrum of related disorders.[18] It is unclear as of 2017 if identifying a FASD-related conditions benefits the individual.[9] \n \n Signs and symptoms [ edit ] \n \n Facial characteristics of a child with FAS \n \n The key of FASD can vary between individuals exposed to alcohol during pregnancy. While consensus exists for the definition and diagnosis of FAS, minor variations among the systems lead to differences in definitions and diagnostic cut-off criteria for other diagnoses across the FASD continuum. The central nervous system damage criteria particularly lack clear consensus. A working knowledge of the key features is helpful in understanding FASD diagnoses and conditions, and each is reviewed with attention to similarities and differences across the four diagnostic systems. More than 400 problems, however, can occur with FASD.[19] \n \n Growth [ edit ] \n \n In terms of FASD, growth deficiency is defined as significantly below average height, weight or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure, and can be assessed at any point in the lifespan. Growth measurements must be adjusted for parental height, gestational age (for a premature infant), and other postnatal insults (e.g., poor nutrition), although birth height and weight are the preferred measurements.[20] Deficiencies are documented when height or weight falls at or below the 10th percentile of standardized growth charts appropriate to the population.[21] \n \n Criteria for FASD are least specific in the IOM diagnostic system (\"low birth weight..., decelerating weight not due to nutrition..., [or] disproportional low weight to height\" p. 4 of executive summary),[16] while the CDC and Canadian guidelines use the 10th percentile as a cut-off to determine growth deficiency.[2][22] The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" allows for mid-range gradations in growth deficiency (between the 3rd and 10th percentiles) and severe growth deficiency at or below the 3rd percentile.[20] Growth deficiency (at severe, moderate, or mild levels) contributes to diagnoses of FAS and pFAS, but not ARND or static encephalopathy. \n \n Growth deficiency is ranked as follows by the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\":[20] \n \n Severe: Height and weight at or below the 3rd percentile. \n \n Moderate: Either height or weight at or below the 3rd percentile, but not both. \n \n Mild: Either height or weight or both between the 3rd and 10th percentiles. \n \n None: Height and weight both above the 10th percentile. \n \n In the initial studies that discovered FAS, growth deficiency was a requirement for inclusion in the studies; thus, all the original people with FAS had growth deficiency as an artifact of sampling characteristics used to establish criteria for the syndrome.[citation needed] That is, growth deficiency is a key feature of FASD because growth deficiency was a criterion for inclusion in the study that defined FAS. This suggests growth deficiency may be less critical for understanding the disabilities of FASD than the neurobehavioral sequelae to the brain damage.[16] \n \n Facial features [ edit ] \n \n Several characteristic craniofacial abnormalities are often visible in individuals with FAS.[23] The presence of FAS facial features indicates brain damage, although brain damage may also exist in their absence. FAS facial features (and most other visible, but non-diagnostic, deformities) are believed to be caused mainly during the 10th and 20th week of gestation.[24] \n \n Refinements in diagnostic criteria since 1975 have yielded three distinctive and diagnostically significant facial features known to result from prenatal alcohol exposure and distinguishes FAS from other disorders with partially overlapping characteristics.[25][26] The three FAS facial features are: \n \n A smooth philtrum: The divot or groove between the nose and upper lip flattens with increased prenatal alcohol exposure. \n \n Thin vermilion: The upper lip thins with increased prenatal alcohol exposure. \n \n Small palpebral fissures: Eye width decreases with increased prenatal alcohol exposure. \n \n Measurement of FAS facial features uses criteria developed by the University of Washington. The lip and philtrum are measured by a trained physician with the Lip-Philtrum Guide,[27] a five-point Likert Scale with representative photographs of lip and philtrum combinations ranging from normal (ranked 1) to severe (ranked 5). Palpebral fissure length (PFL) is measured in millimeters with either calipers or a clear ruler and then compared to a PFL growth chart, also developed by the University of Washington.[28] \n \n Ranking FAS facial features is complicated because the three separate facial features can be affected independently by prenatal alcohol. A summary of the criteria follows:[20][29] \n \n Severe: All three facial features ranked independently as severe (lip ranked at 4 or 5, philtrum ranked at 4 or 5, and PFL two or more standard deviations below average). \n \n Moderate: Two facial features ranked as severe and one feature ranked as moderate (lip or philtrum ranked at 3, or PFL between one and two standard deviations below average). \n \n philtrum ranked at 3, PFL between one and two standard deviations below average). Mild: A mild ranking of FAS facial features covers a broad range of facial feature combinations: Two facial features ranked severe and one ranked within normal limits, One facial feature ranked severe and two ranked moderate, or One facial feature ranked severe, one ranked moderate and one ranked within normal limits. \n \n None: All three facial features ranked within normal limits. \n \n Central nervous system [ edit ] \n \n Central nervous system (CNS) damage is the primary key feature of any FASD diagnosis. Prenatal alcohol exposure, which is classified as a teratogen, can damage the brain across a continuum of gross to subtle impairments, depending on the amount, timing, and frequency of the exposure as well as genetic predispositions of the fetus and mother.[16][30] While functional abnormalities are the behavioral and cognitive expressions of the FASD disability, CNS damage can be assessed in three areas: structural, neurological, and functional impairments. \n \n All four diagnostic systems allow for assessment of CNS damage in these areas, but criteria vary. The IOM system requires structural or neurological impairment for a diagnosis of FAS, but also allows a \"complex pattern\" of functional anomalies for diagnosing PFAS and ARND.[16] The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" and CDC guidelines allow for a positive CNS finding in any of the three areas for any FASD diagnosis, but functional anomalies must measure at two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains for a diagnosis of FAS, PFAS, and ARND.[20][22] The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" also allows for an FASD diagnosis when only two functional domains are measured at two standard deviations or worse.[20] The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" further elaborates the degree of CNS damage according to four ranks: \n \n Definite: Structural impairments or neurological impairments for FAS or static encephalopathy. \n \n Probable: Significant dysfunction of two standard deviations or worse in three or more functional domains. \n \n Possible: Mild to moderate dysfunction of two standard deviations or worse in one or two functional domains or by judgment of the clinical evaluation team that CNS damage cannot be dismissed. \n \n by judgment of the clinical evaluation team that CNS damage cannot be dismissed. Unlikely: No evidence of CNS damage. \n \n Structural [ edit ] \n \n Structural abnormalities of the brain are observable, physical damage to the brain or brain structures caused by prenatal alcohol exposure. Structural impairments may include microcephaly (small head size) of two or more standard deviations below the average, or other abnormalities in brain structure (e.g., agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar hypoplasia).[16] \n \n Microcephaly is determined by comparing head circumference (often called occipitofrontal circumference, or OFC) to appropriate OFC growth charts.[21] Other structural impairments must be observed through medical imaging techniques by a trained physician. Because imaging procedures are expensive and relatively inaccessible to most people, diagnosis of FAS is not frequently made via structural impairments, except for microcephaly. \n \n Evidence of a CNS structural impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS, and neurological and functional impairments are highly likely.[2][16][20][22] \n \n During the first trimester of pregnancy, alcohol interferes with the migration and organization of brain cells, which can create structural deformities or deficits within the brain.[31] During the third trimester, damage can be caused to the hippocampus, which plays a role in memory, learning, emotion, and encoding visual and auditory information, all of which can create neurological and functional CNS impairments as well.[32] \n \n As of 2002, there were 25 reports of autopsies on infants known to have FAS. The first was in 1973, on an infant who died shortly after birth.[33] The examination revealed extensive brain damage, including microcephaly, migration anomalies, callosal dysgenesis, and a massive neuroglial, leptomeningeal heterotopia covering the left hemisphere.[34] \n \n In 1977, Dr. Clarren described a second infant whose mother was a binge drinker. The infant died ten days after birth. The autopsy showed severe hydrocephalus, abnormal neuronal migration, and a small corpus callosum (which connects the two brain hemispheres) and cerebellum.[34] FAS has also been linked to brainstem and cerebellar changes, agenesis of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, neuronal migration errors, absent olfactory bulbs, meningomyelocele, and porencephaly.[34] \n \n Neurological [ edit ] \n \n When structural impairments are not observable or do not exist, neurological impairments are assessed. In the context of FASD, neurological impairments are caused by prenatal alcohol exposure which causes general neurological damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the peripheral nervous system, or the autonomic nervous system. A determination of a neurological problem must be made by a trained physician, and must not be due to a postnatal insult, such as a high fever, concussion, traumatic brain injury, etc. \n \n All four diagnostic systems show virtual agreement on their criteria for CNS damage at the neurological level, and evidence of a CNS neurological impairment due to prenatal alcohol exposure will result in a diagnosis of FAS or pFAS, and functional impairments are highly likely.[2][16][20][22] \n \n Neurological problems are expressed as either hard signs, or diagnosable disorders, such as epilepsy or other seizure disorders, or soft signs. Soft signs are broader, nonspecific neurological impairments, or symptoms, such as impaired fine motor skills, neurosensory hearing loss, poor gait, clumsiness, poor eye-hand coordination. Many soft signs have norm-referenced criteria, while others are determined through clinical judgment. \"Clinical judgment\" is only as good as the clinician, and soft signs should be assessed by either a pediatric neurologist, a pediatric neuropsychologist, or both. \n \n Functional [ edit ] \n \n When structural or neurological impairments are not observed, all four diagnostic systems allow CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure to be assessed in terms of functional impairments.[2][16][20][22] Functional impairments are deficits, problems, delays, or abnormalities due to prenatal alcohol exposure (rather than hereditary causes or postnatal insults) in observable and measurable domains related to daily functioning, often referred to as developmental disabilities. There is no consensus on a specific pattern of functional impairments due to prenatal alcohol exposure[16] and only CDC guidelines label developmental delays as such,[22] so criteria (and FASD diagnoses) vary somewhat across diagnostic systems. \n \n The four diagnostic systems list various CNS domains that can qualify for functional impairment that can determine an FASD diagnosis: \n \n Related signs [ edit ] \n \n Other conditions may commonly co-occur with FAS, stemming from prenatal alcohol exposure. However, these conditions are considered alcohol-related birth defects[16] and not diagnostic criteria for FAS. \n \n Cause [ edit ] \n \n Fetal alcohol syndrome usually occurs when a pregnant woman has more than four standard drinks per day.[36] Milder symptoms have been found with two drinks per day during the early part of pregnancy.[36][37] Among those who are alcoholic about a third of children have FAS.[36] \n \n Evidence of harm from less than two drinks per day or 10 drinks per week is not clear.[36][38] While small amounts of alcohol do not cause an abnormal appearance, it may cause behavioral issues.[11] There is conflicting evidence regarding whether drinking by fathers before conception can cause FAS.[36] \n \n Mechanism [ edit ] \n \n Despite intense research efforts, the exact mechanism for the development of FAS or FASD is unknown. On the contrary, clinical and animal studies have identified a broad spectrum of pathways through which maternal alcohol can negatively affect the outcome of a pregnancy. Clear conclusions with universal validity are difficult to draw, since different ethnic groups show considerable genetic polymorphism for the hepatic enzymes responsible for ethanol detoxification.[39] \n \n Genetic examinations have revealed a continuum of long-lasting molecular effects that are not only timing specific but are also dosage specific; with even moderate amounts being able to cause alterations.[40] \n \n A human fetus appears to be at triple risk from maternal alcohol consumption:[41][42] \n \n The placenta allows free entry of ethanol and toxic metabolites like acetaldehyde into the fetal compartment. The so-called placental barrier is of almost no barrier with respect to ethanol. The developing fetal nervous system appears particularly sensitive to ethanol toxicity. The latter interferes with proliferation, differentiation, neuronal migration, axonic outgrowth, integration, and fine-tuning of the synaptic network. In short, all major processes in the developing central nervous system appear compromised. Fetal tissues are quite different from adult tissues in function and purpose. For example, the main detoxicating organ in adults is the liver, whereas the fetal liver is incapable of detoxifying ethanol, as the ADH and ALDH enzymes have not yet been brought to expression at this early stage. Up to term, fetal tissues do not have significant capacity for the detoxification of ethanol, and the fetus remains exposed to ethanol in the amniotic fluid for periods far longer than the decay time of ethanol in the maternal circulation. The lack of significant quantities of ADH and ALDH means that fetal tissues have much lower quantities of antioxidant enzymes, like SOD, glutathione transferases, and glutathion peroxidases, resulting in antioxidant protection being much less effective.[ citation needed ] \n \n Diagnosis [ edit ] \n \n Because admission of alcohol use during pregnancy can stigmatize birth mothers, many are reluctant to admit drinking or to provide an accurate report of the quantity they drank. This complicates diagnosis and treatment [22] of the syndrome. As a result, diagnosis of the severity of FASD relies on protocols of observation of the child's physiology and behavior rather than maternal self-reporting. Presently, four FASD diagnostic systems that diagnose FAS and other FASD conditions have been developed in North America: \n \n The Institute of Medicine's guidelines for FAS, the first system to standardize diagnoses of individuals with prenatal alcohol exposure; [16] \n \n The University of Washington's \"The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code\", which ranks the four key features of FASD on a Likert scale of one to four and yields 256 descriptive codes that can be categorized into 22 distinct clinical categories, ranging from FAS to no findings; [20] \n \n The Centers for Disease Control's \"Fetal Alcohol Syndrome: Guidelines for Referral and Diagnosis\", which established consensus on the diagnosis FAS in the U.S. but deferred addressing other FASD conditions; [22] and \n \n and Canadian guidelines for FASD diagnoses, which established criteria for diagnosing FASD in Canada and harmonized most differences between the IOM and University of Washington's systems.[2] \n \n Each diagnostic system requires that a complete FASD evaluation includes an assessment of the four key features of FASD, described below. A positive finding on all four features is required for a diagnosis of FAS. However, prenatal alcohol exposure and central nervous system damage are the critical elements of the spectrum of FASD, and a positive finding in these two features is sufficient for an FASD diagnosis that is not \"full-blown FAS\". \n \n While the four diagnostic systems essentially agree on criteria for fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), there are still differences when full criteria for FAS are not met. This has resulted in differing and evolving nomenclature for other conditions across the spectrum of FASD, which may account for such a wide variety of terminology. Most individuals with deficits resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure do not express all features of FAS and fall into other FASD conditions.[16] The Canadian guidelines recommend the assessment and descriptive approach of the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" for each key feature of FASD and the terminology of the IOM in diagnostic categories, excepting ARBD.[2] \n \n Thus, other FASD conditions are partial expressions of FAS. However, these other FASD conditions may create disabilities similar to FAS if the key area of central nervous system damage shows clinical deficits in two or more of ten domains of brain functioning. Essentially, even though growth deficiency and/or FAS facial features may be mild or nonexistent in other FASD conditions, yet clinically significant brain damage of the central nervous system is present. In these other FASD conditions, an individual may be at greater risk for adverse outcomes because brain damage is present without associated visual cues of poor growth or the \"FAS face\" that might ordinarily trigger an FASD evaluation. Such individuals may be misdiagnosed with primary mental health disorders such as ADHD or oppositional defiance disorder without appreciation that brain damage is the underlying cause of these disorders, which requires a different treatment paradigm than typical mental health disorders. While other FASD conditions may not yet be included as an ICD or DSM-IV-TR diagnosis, they nonetheless pose significant impairment in functional behavior because of underlying brain damage. \n \n Fetal alcohol syndrome [ edit ] \n \n The following criteria must be fully met for an FAS diagnosis:[2][16][20][22] \n \n Growth deficiency: Prenatal or postnatal height or weight (or both) at or below the 10th percentile[21] FAS facial features: All three FAS facial features present[28] Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural neurological, or functional impairment Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed or Unknown prenatal alcohol exposure \n \n Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the first diagnosable condition of FASD that was discovered. FAS is the only expression of FASD that has garnered consensus among experts to become an official ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnosis. To make this diagnosis or determine any FASD condition, a multi-disciplinary evaluation is necessary to assess each of the four key features for assessment. Generally, a trained physician will determine growth deficiency and FAS facial features. While a qualified physician may also assess central nervous system structural abnormalities and/or neurological problems, usually central nervous system damage is determined through psychological, speech-language, and occupational therapy assessments to ascertain clinically significant impairments in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains.[43] Prenatal alcohol exposure risk may be assessed by a qualified physician, psychologist, social worker, or chemical health counselor. These professionals work together as a team to assess and interpret data of each key feature for assessment and develop an integrative, multi-disciplinary report to diagnose FAS (or other FASD conditions) in an individual. \n \n Partial FAS [ edit ] \n \n Partial FAS (pFAS) was previously known as atypical FAS in the 1997 edition of the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\". People with pFAS have a confirmed history of prenatal alcohol exposure, but may lack growth deficiency or the complete facial stigmata. Central nervous system damage is present at the same level as FAS. These individuals have the same functional disabilities but \"look\" less like FAS. \n \n The following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of Partial FAS:[2][16][20] \n \n Growth deficiency: Growth or height may range from normal to deficient[21] FAS facial features: Two or three FAS facial features present[28] Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural, neurological, or functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains[43] Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure \n \n Fetal alcohol effects [ edit ] \n \n Fetal alcohol effects (FAE) is a previous term for alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder and alcohol-related birth defects.[1] It was initially used in research studies to describe humans and animals in whom teratogenic effects were seen after confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure (or unknown exposure for humans), but without obvious physical anomalies.[44] Smith (1981) described FAE as an \"extremely important concept\" to highlight the debilitating effects of brain damage, regardless of the growth or facial features.[45] This term has fallen out of favor with clinicians because it was often regarded by the public as a less severe disability than FAS, when in fact its effects can be just as detrimental.[46] \n \n Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder [ edit ] \n \n Alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder (ARND) was initially suggested by the Institute of Medicine to replace the term FAE and focus on central nervous system damage, rather than growth deficiency or FAS facial features. The Canadian guidelines also use this diagnosis and the same criteria. While the \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" includes these criteria for three of its diagnostic categories, it refers to this condition as static encephalopathy. The behavioral effects of ARND are not necessarily unique to alcohol however, so use of the term must be within the context of confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure.[47] ARND may be gaining acceptance over the terms FAE and ARBD to describe FASD conditions with central nervous system abnormalities or behavioral or cognitive abnormalities or both due to prenatal alcohol exposure without regard to growth deficiency or FAS facial features.[47][48] \n \n The following criteria must be fully met for a diagnosis of ARND or static encephalopathy:[2][16][20] \n \n Growth deficiency: Growth or height may range from normal to minimally deficient[21] FAS facial features: Minimal or no FAS facial features present[28] Central nervous system damage: Clinically significant structural, neurological, or functional impairment in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains[43] Prenatal alcohol exposure: Confirmed prenatal alcohol exposure;0 \n \n Alcohol-related birth defects [ edit ] \n \n Alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), formerly known as possible fetal alcohol effect (PFAE),[44] was a term proposed as an alternative to FAE and PFAE[49] The IOM presents ARBD as a list of congenital anomalies that are linked to maternal alcohol use but have no key features of FASD.[16] PFAE and ARBD have fallen out of favor because these anomalies are not necessarily specific to maternal alcohol consumption and are not criteria for diagnosis of FASD.[47] The Canadian guidelines recommend that ARBD should not be used as an umbrella term or diagnostic category for FASD. \n \n Exposure [ edit ] \n \n Prenatal alcohol exposure is determined by interview of the biological mother or other family members knowledgeable of the mother's alcohol use during the pregnancy (if available), prenatal health records (if available), and review of available birth records, court records (if applicable), chemical dependency treatment records (if applicable), or other reliable sources. \n \n Exposure level is assessed as confirmed exposure, unknown exposure, and confirmed absence of exposure by the IOM, CDC and Canadian diagnostic systems. The \"4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" further distinguishes confirmed exposure as High Risk and Some Risk: \n \n High Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy known to be at high blood alcohol levels (100 mg/dL or greater) delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy. \n \n Some Risk: Confirmed use of alcohol during pregnancy with use less than High Risk or unknown usage patterns. \n \n Unknown Risk: Unknown use of alcohol during pregnancy. \n \n No Risk: Confirmed absence of prenatal alcohol exposure. \n \n Confirmed exposure [ edit ] \n \n Amount, frequency, and timing of prenatal alcohol use can dramatically impact the other three key features of FASD. While consensus exists that alcohol is a teratogen, there is no clear consensus as to what level of exposure is toxic.[16] The CDC guidelines are silent on these elements diagnostically. The IOM and Canadian guidelines explore this further, acknowledging the importance of significant alcohol exposure from regular or heavy episodic alcohol consumption in determining, but offer no standard for diagnosis. Canadian guidelines discuss this lack of clarity and parenthetically point out that \"heavy alcohol use\" is defined by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism as five or more drinks per episode on five or more days during a 30-day period.[50] \n \n \"The 4-Digit Diagnostic Code\" ranking system distinguishes between levels of prenatal alcohol exposure as high risk and some risk. It operationalizes high risk exposure as a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) greater than 100 mg/dL delivered at least weekly in early pregnancy. This BAC level is typically reached by a 55 kg female drinking six to eight beers in one sitting.[20] \n \n Unknown exposure [ edit ] \n \n For many adopted or adults and children in foster care, records or other reliable sources may not be available for review. Reporting alcohol use during pregnancy can also be stigmatizing to birth mothers, especially if alcohol use is ongoing.[22] In these cases, all diagnostic systems use an unknown prenatal alcohol exposure designation. A diagnosis of FAS is still possible with an unknown exposure level if other key features of FASD are present at clinical levels. \n \n Confirmed absence of exposure [ edit ] \n \n Confirmed absence of exposure would apply to planned pregnancies in which no alcohol was used or pregnancies of women who do not use alcohol or report no use during the pregnancy. This designation is relatively rare, as most people presenting for an FASD evaluation are at least suspected to have had a prenatal alcohol exposure due to presence of other key features of FASD.[20][22] \n \n Ten brain domains [ edit ] \n \n A recent effort to standardize assessment of functional CNS damage has been suggested by an experienced FASD diagnostic team in Minnesota. The proposed framework attempts to harmonize IOM, 4-Digit Diagnostic Code, CDC, and Canadian guidelines for measuring CNS damage vis-\u00e0-vis FASD evaluations and diagnosis. The standardized approach is referred to as the Ten Brain Domains and encompasses aspects of all four diagnostic systems' recommendations for assessing CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure. The framework provides clear definitions of brain dysfunction, specifies empirical data needed for accurate diagnosis, and defines intervention considerations that address the complex nature of FASD with the intention to avoid common secondary disabilities.[43] \n \n The proposed Ten Brain Domains include:[43] \n \n The Fetal Alcohol Diagnostic Program (FADP) uses unpublished Minnesota state criteria of performance at 1.5 or more standard deviations on standardized testing in three or more of the Ten Brain Domains to determine CNS damage. However, the Ten Brain Domains are easily incorporated into any of the four diagnostic systems' CNS damage criteria, as the framework only proposes the domains, rather than the cut-off criteria for FASD.[51] \n \n Differential diagnosis [ edit ] \n \n The CDC reviewed nine syndromes that have overlapping features with FAS; however, none of these syndromes include all three FAS facial features, and none are the result of prenatal alcohol exposure:[22] \n \n Prevention [ edit ] \n \n The only certain way to prevent FAS is to avoid drinking alcohol during pregnancy.[47][52] In the United States, the Surgeon General recommended in 1981, and again in 2005, that women abstain from alcohol use while pregnant or while planning a pregnancy, the latter to avoid damage even in the earliest stages (even weeks) of a pregnancy, as the woman may not be aware that she has conceived.[15] In the United States, federal legislation has required that warning labels be placed on all alcoholic beverage containers since 1988 under the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act. \n \n There is some controversy surrounding the \"zero-tolerance\" approach taken by many countries when it comes to alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The assertion that moderate drinking causes FAS is said to lack strong evidence and, in fact, the practice of equating a responsible level of drinking with potential harm to the fetus may have negative social, legal, and health impacts.[53] In addition, special care should be taken when considering statistics on this disease, as prevalence and causation is often linked with FASD, which is more common and causes less harm, as opposed to FAS.[54] \n \n Treatment [ edit ] \n \n There is no cure for FASD, but treatment is possible. Because CNS damage, symptoms, secondary disabilities, and needs vary widely by individual, there is no one treatment type that works for everyone. \n \n Medication [ edit ] \n \n Psychoactive drugs are frequently tried on those with FASD as many FASD symptoms are mistaken for or overlap with other disorders, most notably ADHD.[55] \n \n Behavioral interventions [ edit ] \n \n Behavioral interventions are based on the learning theory, which is the basis for many parenting and professional strategies and interventions.[48] Along with ordinary parenting styles, such strategies are frequently used by default for treating those with FAS, as the diagnoses oppositional defiance disorder (ODD), conduct disorder, reactive attachment disorder (RAD) often overlap with FAS (along with ADHD), and these are sometimes thought to benefit from behavioral interventions. Frequently, a person's poor academic achievement results in special education services, which also utilizes principles of learning theory, behavior modification, and outcome-based education. \n \n Developmental framework [ edit ] \n \n Many books and handouts on FAS recommend a developmental approach, based on developmental psychology, even though most do not specify it as such and provide little theoretical background. Optimal human development generally occurs in identifiable stages (e.g., Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development, Erik Erikson's stages of psychosocial development, John Bowlby's attachment framework, and other developmental stage theories). FAS interferes with normal development,[56] which may cause stages to be delayed, skipped, or immaturely developed. Over time, an unaffected child can negotiate the increasing demands of life by progressing through stages of development normally, but not so for a child with FAS.[56] \n \n By knowing what developmental stages and tasks children follow, treatment and interventions for FAS can be tailored to helping a person meet developmental tasks and demands successfully.[56] If a person is delayed in the adaptive behavior domain, for instance, then interventions would be recommended to target specific delays through additional education and practice (e.g., practiced instruction on tying shoelaces), giving reminders, or making accommodations (e.g., using slip-on shoes) to support the desired functioning level. This approach is an advance over behavioral interventions, because it takes the person's developmental context into account while developing interventions.[citation needed] \n \n Advocacy model [ edit ] \n \n The advocacy model takes the point of view that someone is needed to actively mediate between the environment and the person with FAS.[47] Advocacy activities are conducted by an advocate (for example, a family member, friend, or case manager) and fall into three basic categories. An advocate for FAS: (1) interprets FAS and the disabilities that arise from it and explains it to the environment in which the person operates, (2) engenders change or accommodation on behalf of the person, and (3) assists the person in developing and reaching attainable goals.[47] \n \n The advocacy model is often recommended, for example, when developing an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for the person's progress at school.[55] \n \n An understanding of the developmental framework would presumably inform and enhance the advocacy model, but advocacy also implies interventions at a systems level as well, such as educating schools, social workers, and so forth on best practices for FAS. However, several organizations devoted to FAS also use the advocacy model at a community practice level as well.[57] \n \n Public health and policy [ edit ] \n \n Treating FAS at the public health and public policy level promotes FAS prevention and diversion of public resources to assist those with FAS.[47] It is related to the advocacy model but promoted at a systems level (rather than with the individual or family), such as developing community education and supports, state or province level prevention efforts (e.g., screening for maternal alcohol use during OB/GYN or prenatal medical care visits), or national awareness programs. Several organizations and state agencies in the U.S. are dedicated to this type of intervention.[57] \n \n The US Centers for Disease Control estimates 3 million women in the United States are at risk of having a baby with FASD, and recommended that women of child-bearing age should be on birth control or abstain from drinking alcohol as the safest way to avoid this.[58] \n \n Prognosis [ edit ] \n \n Primary disabilities [ edit ] \n \n The primary disabilities of FAS are the functional difficulties with which the child is born as a result of CNS damage due to prenatal alcohol exposure.[59] Often, primary disabilities are mistaken as behavior problems, but the underlying CNS damage is the originating source of a functional difficulty,[60] rather than a mental health condition, which is considered a secondary disability. \n \n The exact mechanisms for functional problems of primary disabilities are not always fully understood, but animal studies have begun to shed light on some correlates between functional problems and brain structures damaged by prenatal alcohol exposure.[47] Representative examples include: \n \n Functional difficulties may result from CNS damage in more than one domain, but common functional difficulties by domain include:[47][48][56][60] Note that this is not an exhaustive list of difficulties. \n \n Secondary disabilities [ edit ] \n \n The secondary disabilities of FAS are those that arise later in life secondary to CNS damage. These disabilities often emerge over time due to a mismatch between the primary disabilities and environmental expectations; secondary disabilities can be ameliorated with early interventions and appropriate supportive services.[59] \n \n Six main secondary disabilities were identified in a University of Washington research study of 473 subjects diagnosed with FAS, PFAS (partial fetal alcohol syndrome), and ARND (alcohol-related neurodevelopmental disorder):[47][59] \n \n Mental health problems: Diagnosed with ADHD, Clinical Depression, or other mental illness, experienced by over 90% of the subjects \n \n Disrupted school experience: Suspended or expelled from school or dropped out of school, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older) \n \n Trouble with the law: Charged or convicted with a crime, experienced by 60% of the subjects (age 12 and older) \n \n Confinement: For inpatient psychiatric care, inpatient chemical dependency care, or incarcerated for a crime, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older) \n \n Inappropriate sexual behavior: Sexual advances, sexual touching, or promiscuity, experienced by about 50% of the subjects (age 12 and older) \n \n Alcohol and drug problems: Abuse or dependency, experienced by 35% of the subjects (age 12 and older) \n \n Two additional secondary disabilities exist for adults:[47][59] \n \n Dependent living: Group home, living with family or friends, or some sort of assisted living, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older) \n \n Problems with employment: Required ongoing job training or coaching, could not keep a job, unemployed, experienced by 80% of the subjects (age 21 and older) \n \n Protective factors and strengths [ edit ] \n \n Eight factors were identified in the same study as universal protective factors that reduced the incidence rate of the secondary disabilities:[47][59] \n \n Living in a stable and nurturing home for over 73% of life \n \n Being diagnosed with FAS before age six \n \n Never having experienced violence \n \n Remaining in each living situation for at least 2.8 years \n \n Experiencing a \"good quality home\" (meeting 10 or more defined qualities) from age 8 to 12 years old \n \n Having been found eligible for developmental disability (DD) services \n \n Having basic needs met for at least 13% of life \n \n Having a diagnosis of FAS (rather than another FASD condition) \n \n Malbin (2002) has identified the following areas of interests and talents as strengths that often stand out for those with FASD and should be utilized, like any strength, in treatment planning:[48] \n \n Music, playing instruments, composing, singing, art, spelling, reading, computers, mechanics, woodworking, skilled vocations (welding, electrician, etc.), writing, poetry \n \n Participation in non-impact sport or physical fitness activities \n \n Epidemiology [ edit ] \n \n FASD is estimated to affect between 2% and 5% of people in the United States and Western Europe.[6] FAS is believed to occur in between 0.2 and 9 per 1000 live births in the United States.[6] The lifetime cost of an individual with FAS were estimated to be two million USD in 2002.[6] Drinking any quantity during pregnancy, the risk to give birth to a FAS is about 1,5%, and to a FASD about 15%. Drinking large quantities, defined as 2 standard drinks a day, or 6 standard drinks in a short time, give a 50% risk to a FAS birth.[64] \n \n Australia [ edit ] \n \n FASD among Australian youth is more common in indigenous Australians.[65] The only states that have registered birth defects in Australian youth are Western Australia, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.[66] In Australia only 12% of Australian health professionals are aware of the diagnostics and symptoms of FASD.[65] In Western Australia, the rate of births resulting in FASD is 0.02 per 1000 births for non-Indigenous Australians, however among indigenous births the rate is 2.76 per 1000 births.[66] In Victoria, there have been no registered FASD related births for indigenous Australians, but the rate for the general population in Victoria is 0.01-0.03 per 1000 births.[66] There have been no dedicated FASD clinics within Western Australia, but there are also no nationally supported diagnostic criteria anywhere in Australia.[67] Passive surveillance is a prevention technique used within Australia to assist in monitoring and establishing detectable defects during pregnancy and childhood.[66] \n \n History [ edit ] \n \n From the 1960s to the 1980s, alcohol was commonly used as a tocolytic, a method to stop preterm labor. The method originated with Dr. Fritz Fuchs, the chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Cornell University Medical College.[68][69] Doctors recommended a small amount of alcohol to calm the uterus during contractions in early pregnancy or Braxton Hicks contractions. In later stages of pregnancy, the alcohol was administered intravenously and often in large amounts. \"Women experienced similar effects as occur with oral ingestion, including intoxication, nausea and vomiting, and potential alcohol poisoning, followed by hangovers when the alcohol was discontinued.\"[70] Vomiting put the mother at a high risk for aspiration and was \"a brutal procedure for all involved.\" [68] Because the alcohol was being given intravenously, the doctor could continue giving the treatment to the mother long after she had passed out, resulting in her being more intoxicated than would otherwise be possible. Such heavy intoxication is highly likely to contribute to FASD.[68] \n \n Historical references [ edit ] \n \n Anecdotal accounts of prohibitions against maternal alcohol use from Biblical, ancient Greek, and ancient Roman sources[71] imply a historical awareness of links between maternal alcohol use and negative child outcomes.[33] For example, in the Bible, Judges 13:4 (addressed to a woman who was going to have a baby) reads: \"Therefore be careful and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean\" (ESV). In 1725 British physicians petitioned the House of Commons on the effects of strong drink when consumed by pregnant women saying that such drinking is \u201c\u2026too often the cause of weak, feeble, and distempered children, who must be, instead of an advantage and strength, a charge to their country.\u201d[72] There are many other such historical references. In Gaelic Scotland, the mother and nurse were not allowed to consume ale during pregnancy and breastfeeding (Martin Martin). Claims that alcohol consumption caused idiocy were part of the Teetotalism's message in the 19th century,[73] but such claims, despite some attempts to offer evidence, were ignored because no mechanism could be advanced.[74] \n \n The earliest recorded observation of possible links between maternal alcohol use and fetal damage was made in 1899 by Dr. William Sullivan, a Liverpool prison physician who noted higher rates of stillbirth for 120 alcoholic female prisoners than their sober female relatives; he suggested the causal agent to be alcohol use.[75] This contradicted the predominating belief at the time that heredity caused intellectual disability, poverty, and criminal behavior, which contemporary studies on the subjects usually concluded.[47] A case study by Henry H. Goddard of the Kallikak family\u2014popular in the early 1900s\u2014represents this earlier perspective,[76] though later researchers have suggested that the Kallikaks almost certainly had FAS.[77] General studies and discussions on alcoholism throughout the mid-1900s were typically based on a heredity argument.[78] \n \n Prior to fetal alcohol syndrome being specifically identified and named in 1973, only a few studies had noted differences between the children of mothers who used alcohol during pregnancy or breast-feeding and those who did not, and identified alcohol use as a possible contributing factor rather than heredity.[47] \n \n Recognition as a syndrome [ edit ] \n \n Fetal Alcohol Syndrome was named in 1973 by two dysmorphologists, Drs. Kenneth Lyons Jones and David Weyhe Smith of the University of Washington Medical School in Seattle, United States. They identified a pattern of \"craniofacial, limb, and cardiovascular defects associated with prenatal onset growth deficiency and developmental delay\" in eight unrelated children of three ethnic groups, all born to mothers who were alcoholics.[79] The pattern of malformations indicated that the damage was prenatal. News of the discovery shocked some, while others were skeptical of the findings.[80] \n \n Dr. Paul Lemoine of Nantes, France had already published a study in a French medical journal in 1968 about children with distinctive features whose mothers were alcoholics,[81] and in the U.S., Christy Ulleland and colleagues at the University of Washington Medical School had conducted an 18-month study in 1968\u20131969 documenting the risk of maternal alcohol consumption among the offspring of 11 alcoholic mothers.[82] The Washington and Nantes findings were confirmed by a research group in Gothenburg, Sweden in 1979.[83] Researchers in France, Sweden, and the United States were struck by how similar these children looked, though they were not related, and how they behaved in the same unfocused and hyperactive manner.[83] \n \n Within nine years of the Washington discovery, animal studies, including non-human monkey studies carried out at the University of Washington Primate Center by Dr. Sterling Clarren, had confirmed that alcohol was a teratogen. By 1978, 245 cases of FAS had been reported by medical researchers, and the syndrome began to be described as the most frequent known cause of intellectual disability. \n \n While many syndromes are eponymous, i.e. named after the physician first reporting the association of symptoms, Dr. Smith named FAS after the causal agent of the symptoms.[84] He reasoned that doing so would encourage prevention, believing that if people knew maternal alcohol consumption caused the syndrome, then abstinence during pregnancy would follow from patient education and public awareness.[84] At the time, nobody was aware of the full range of possible birth defects from FAS or its rate of prevalence.[84] Over time, as subsequent research and clinical experience suggested that a range of effects (including physical, behavioral, and cognitive) could arise from prenatal alcohol exposure, the term Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) was developed to include FAS as well as other conditions resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure.[84] Currently, FAS[16][44][79] is the only expression of prenatal alcohol exposure defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems and assigned ICD-9 and diagnoses. \n \n See also [ edit ] ||||| Snooki Talks Drinking on 'Ellen': 'Why Did I Wake Up in a Garbage Can?' \n \n Email This Nicole \" \n \n \n \n Polizzi, who was \n \n \n \n The reality star-turned-author, whose book, 'A Shore Thing,' hit shelves yesterday, Nicole \" Snooki \" Polizzi has a well-documented history of having a darn good time, and in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres, the 'Jersey Shore's' littlest lush admits that she may occasionally overdo it.Polizzi, who was fined $500 for disorderly conduct in September following an alcohol-fueled beach outing, confesses that episodes of over-imbibing used to happen as often as once a month.The reality star-turned-author, whose book, 'A Shore Thing,' hit shelves yesterday, told DeGeneres , \"I want to remember my night and sometimes I just don't.\" She went on to admit, \"I don't want to be a role model.\" \n \n While her hard-partying ways have been the source of great amusement for 'Jersey Shore' viewers, Snooki says that living with reckless abandon is not always as fun as it may seem.\"It sucks,\" she says. \"You're like, 'What did I do?

The inspectors general are independent officials who conduct audits, investigations and inspections in the agencies for which they're responsible. \n \n No decision yet to launch probe \n \n There has not yet been a decision on whether to launch a criminal probe. \n \n In response, Clinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill issued a statement that \"It is now more clear than ever that The New York Times report claiming there is a criminal inquiry sought in Hillary Clinton's use of email is false.\" \n \n He added, \"This incident shows the danger of relying on reckless, inaccurate leaks from partisan sources.\" \n \n JUST WATCHED Hillary Clinton on emails: 'everything was permitted' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Hillary Clinton on emails: 'everything was permitted' 06:43 \n \n The request for the Justice Department investigation came after a June 29 memo from the State Department's inspector general stating a review of 55,000 pages of Clinton e-mails found \"hundreds of potentially classified emails within the collection.\" \n \n A follow-up memo from both the State Department and intelligence community inspectors general to Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy on July 17 said they had received confirmation that \"several of the emails contained classified (Intelligence Community) information, though they were not marked as classified. At least one of the emails has been released to the public\" by the State Department. Officials were additionally concerned that possible classified material would be posted in future releases of Clinton's emails. \n \n Clinton's use of the personal account for official business instead of a State Department one stirred up a political storm around the 2016 Democratic presidential contender after news of it emerged in March. \n \n Republicans criticize Clinton \n \n The reported request for an inquiry is likely to renew fierce Republican criticism of Clinton's email practices. \n \n Following the Times report this morning, GOP congressional leaders began launching attacks. \n \n House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio released a statement calling on her to relinquish her server and questioning her judgment. \n \n \"If Secretary Clinton truly has nothing to hide, she can prove it by immediately turning over her server to the proper authorities and allowing them to examine the complete record,\" he said. \n \n Photos: Hillary Clinton email controversy Photos: Hillary Clinton email controversy Hillary Clinton, while U.S. secretary of state, checks her Blackberry on a military plane in October 2011.

Trey Gowdy, chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, echoed Boehner. \n \n \"The best -- the only way -- to resolve these important factual questions is for her to turn over her server to the proper authorities for independent forensic evaluation,\" he said in a statement. \n \n The top Democrat on the Benghazi Committee, however, pushed back on the attacks. \n \n \"I spoke personally to the State Department Inspector General on Thursday, and he said he never asked the Justice Department to launch a criminal investigation of Secretary Clinton's email usage,\" said Maryland Rep. Elijah Cummings. \"Instead, he told me the Intelligence Community IG notified the Justice Department and Congress that they identified classified information in a few emails that were part of the FOIA review, and that none of those emails had been previously marked as classified.\" \n \n Kerry asked for recommendations from inspector \n \n The State Department in May began publicly releasing some of the tens of thousands of emails from the private account that Clinton handed over to it in December. \n \n Officials from the department have been reviewing and redacting the huge collection of documents before putting them in the public domain. \n \n Clinton has said she has nothing to hide and would like the process of making the emails public to be expedited. \n \n Clinton's successor as secretary of state, John Kerry, wrote to the State Department inspector general in March asking for recommendations on the department's practices on document retention and its freedom of information process, a senior state department official told CNN. \n \n \"The Inspector General's assistance is welcomed as we take efforts to improve our policies with respect to the preservation of records in a digital environment,\" the official said. ||||| CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) \u2014 In an interview Monday with The Associated Press, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton said she has \"tried to not only take responsibility, because it was my decision, but to be as transparent as possible\" about her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. \n \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks during an interview with The Associated Press, Monday, Sept. 7, 2015, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

(Associated Press) \n \n Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks during an interview with The Associated Press, Monday, Sept. 7, 2015, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Clinton says she does not need to apologize... (Associated Press) \n \n Here are some other highlights from the interview. \n \n ___ \n \n Q: Why haven't you directly apologized for setting up and using a private email server as secretary of state? \n \n A: \"Well, I understand why people have questions and I'm trying to answer as many of those in as many different settings as I can. What I did was allowed by the State Department. It was fully above board. Everybody in the government with whom I emailed knew that I was using a personal email, and I have said it would have been a better choice to have had two separate email accounts. And I've also tried to not only take responsibility, because it was my decision, but to be as transparent as possible.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Q: Has the email issue damaged your campaign? For example, in terms of morale among staff or in fundraising or getting your message to voters. \n \n A: \"No. Not at all. It's a distraction, certainly. But it hasn't in any way affected the plan for our campaign, the efforts we're making to organize here in Iowa and elsewhere in the country. And I still feel very confident about the organization and the message that my campaign is putting out.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Q: What has this distraction meant for you this summer? \n \n A: \"As the person who has been at the center of it, not very much. I have worked really hard this summer, sticking to my game plan about how I wanted to sort of reintroduce myself to the American people. How I wanted to listen and learn what was on the minds of Iowans. And I feel very good.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Q: What's your reaction to voters who say they don't trust you? \n \n A: \"Well, I don't like to hear that. But I believe by the end of this campaign the American people will know that I'm the person running for president who wants to be not only the president on the big issues that are in the headlines, but the president to really work on all of those personal concerns like I heard in Newton yesterday that keep people up at night.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Q: You have been critical in the past of politically motivated investigations. Has the Select Committee on Benghazi devolved in such a way? \n \n A: \"Well, the American public will have to determine that. There have been seven previous investigations that were conducted by congressional committees. Of course, there was the independent accountability review board that was conducted by leading Americans with expertise in intelligence, diplomacy (and) the military. \n \n \"They all said that there were changes that needed to be made, which I fully embraced as the outgoing secretary of state. And I testified before both the Senate and the House. This committee has now gone longer and spent, I'm told, more money than the Warren Commission on President Kennedy's assassination and many other investigations. I'll let the American people draw their own conclusion.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Q: As a candidate with deep experience in Washington, how do you make your case to voters who are interested in an 'outsider' candidate, such as a Donald Trump or Ben Carson? \n \n A: \"That's what the campaign is for. That's what we're going to be doing in the next months. We have some months to go before the caucus on Feb. 1, and we have debates and there will be other opportunities to lay out what I will do as president. \n \n \"I was endorsed on Saturday by (Sen.) Jeanne Shaheen in New Hampshire, and the press asked her, 'Well, you're endorsing her and there's been a lot of information that one of the other candidates is doing very well and people are interested in outsiders.' \n \n \"And she goes, 'You know, I have been doing this since 1976, and I remember very well in August of 2003, John Kerry was 25 points behind and Howard Dean was surging,' and she went thought chapter and verse, because she has been involved for many years. \n \n \"We're staying on our game plan. We're doing what I think at the end of the day will earn the confidence and trust and support of Iowans and other Americans.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Q: Could Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders next year duplicate then-Ill. Sen Barack Obama's victory over you in 2008? \n \n A: \"You know, I'm not going to speculate. That's your job. You can speculate on political potential scenarios. I'm just going to run my campaign, talk about what I'm doing and why I think I'd be the best president of any of the candidates on either side.\" ||||| This order prescribes a uniform system for classifying, safeguarding, and declassifying national security information, including information relating to defense against transnational terrorism. Our democratic principles require that the American people be informed of the activities of their Government. Also, our Nation's progress depends on the free flow of information both within the Government and to the American people. Nevertheless, throughout our history, the national defense has required that certain information be maintained in confidence in order to protect our citizens, our democratic institutions, our homeland security, and our interactions with foreign nations. Protecting information critical to our Nation's security and demonstrating our commitment to open Government through accurate and accountable application of classification standards and routine, secure, and effective declassification are equally important priorities. \n \n \n \n NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: \n \n \n \n PART 1 -- ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION \n \n \n \n Section 1.1. Classification Standards. (a) Information may be originally classified under the terms of this order only if all of the following conditions are met: \n \n \n \n (1) an original classification authority is classifying the information; \n \n \n \n (2) the information is owned by, produced by or for, or is under the control of the United States Government; \n \n \n \n (3) the information falls within one or more of the categories of information listed in section 1.4 of this order; and \n \n \n \n (4) the original classification authority determines that the unauthorized disclosure of the information reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security, which includes defense against transnational terrorism, and the original classification authority is able to identify or describe the damage. \n \n \n \n (b) If there is significant doubt about the need to classify information, it shall not be classified. This provision does not: \n \n \n \n (1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for classification; or \n \n \n \n (2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review. \n \n \n \n (c) Classified information shall not be declassified automatically as a result of any unauthorized disclosure of identical or similar information. \n \n \n \n (d) The unauthorized disclosure of foreign government information is presumed to cause damage to the national security. \n \n \n \n Sec. 1.2. Classification Levels. (a) Information may be classified at one of the following three levels: \n \n \n \n (1) \"Top Secret\" shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe. \n \n \n \n (2) \"Secret\" shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe. \n \n \n \n (3) \"Confidential\" shall be applied to information, the unauthorized disclosure of which reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the national security that the original classification authority is able to identify or describe. \n \n \n \n (b) Except as otherwise provided by statute, no other terms shall be used to identify United States classified information. \n \n \n \n (c) If there is significant doubt about the appropriate level of classification, it shall be classified at the lower level. \n \n \n \n Sec. 1.3. Classification Authority. (a) The authority to classify information originally may be exercised only by: \n \n \n \n (1) the President and the Vice President; \n \n \n \n (2) agency heads and officials designated by the President; and \n \n \n \n (3) United States Government officials delegated this authority pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. \n \n \n \n (b) Officials authorized to classify information at a specified level are also authorized to classify information at a lower level. \n \n \n \n (c) Delegation of original classification authority. \n \n \n \n (1) Delegations of original classification authority shall be limited to the minimum required to administer this order. Agency heads are responsible for ensuring that designated subordinate officials have a demonstrable and continuing need to exercise this authority. \n \n \n \n (2) \"Top Secret\" original classification authority may be delegated only by the President, the Vice President, or an agency head or official designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section. \n \n \n \n (3) \"Secret\" or \"Confidential\" original classification authority may be delegated only by the President, the Vice President, an agency head or official designated pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or the senior agency official designated under section 5.4(d) of this order, provided that official has been delegated \"Top Secret\" original classification authority by the agency head. \n \n \n \n (4) Each delegation of original classification authority shall be in writing and the authority shall not be redelegated except as provided in this order. Each delegation shall identify the official by name or position. \n \n \n \n (5) Delegations of original classification authority shall be reported or made available by name or position to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office. \n \n \n \n (d) All original classification authorities must receive training in proper classification (including the avoidance of over-classification) and declassification as provided in this order and its implementing directives at least once a calendar year. Such training must include instruction on the proper safeguarding of classified information and on the sanctions in section 5.5 of this order that may be brought against an individual who fails to classify information properly or protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure. Original classification authorities who do not receive such mandatory training at least once within a calendar year shall have their classification authority suspended by the agency head or the senior agency official designated under section 5.4(d) of this order until such training has taken place. A waiver may be granted by the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official if an individual is unable to receive such training due to unavoidable circumstances. Whenever a waiver is granted, the individual shall receive such training as soon as practicable. \n \n \n \n (e) Exceptional cases. When an employee, government contractor, licensee, certificate holder, or grantee of an agency who does not have original classification authority originates information believed by that person to require classification, the information shall be protected in a manner consistent with this order and its implementing directives. The information shall be transmitted promptly as provided under this order or its implementing directives to the agency that has appropriate subject matter interest and classification authority with respect to this information. That agency shall decide within 30 days whether to classify this information. \n \n \n \n Sec. 1.4. Classification Categories. Information shall not be considered for classification unless its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause identifiable or describable damage to the national security in accordance with section 1.2 of this order, and it pertains to one or more of the following: \n \n \n \n (a) military plans, weapons systems, or operations; \n \n \n \n (b) foreign government information; \n \n \n \n (c) intelligence activities (including covert action), intelligence sources or methods, or cryptology; \n \n \n \n (d) foreign relations or foreign activities of the United States, including confidential sources; \n \n \n \n (e) scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to the national security; \n \n \n \n (f) United States Government programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities; \n \n \n \n (g) vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, installations, infrastructures, projects, plans, or protection services relating to the national security; or \n \n \n \n (h) the development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction. \n \n \n \n Sec. 1.5. Duration of Classification. (a) At the time of original classification, the original classification authority shall establish a specific date or event for declassification based on the duration of the national security sensitivity of the information. Upon reaching the date or event, the information shall be automatically declassified. Except for information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the date or event shall not exceed the time frame established in paragraph (b) of this section. \n \n \n \n (b) If the original classification authority cannot determine an earlier specific date or event for declassification, information shall be marked for declassification 10 years from the date of the original decision, unless the original classification authority otherwise determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the original decision. \n \n \n \n (c) An original classification authority may extend the duration of classification up to 25 years from the date of origin of the document, change the level of classification, or reclassify specific information only when the standards and procedures for classifying information under this order are followed. \n \n \n \n (d) No information may remain classified indefinitely. Information marked for an indefinite duration of classification under predecessor orders, for example, marked as \"Originating Agency's Determination Required,\" or classified information that contains incomplete declassification instructions or lacks declassification instructions shall be declassified in accordance with part 3 of this order. \n \n \n \n Sec. 1.6. Identification and Markings. (a) At the time of original classification, the following shall be indicated in a manner that is immediately apparent: \n \n \n \n (1) one of the three classification levels defined in section 1.2 of this order; \n \n \n \n (2) the identity, by name and position, or by personal identifier, of the original classification authority; \n \n \n \n (3) the agency and office of origin, if not otherwise evident; \n \n \n \n (4) declassification instructions, which shall indicate one of the following: \n \n \n \n (A) the date or event for declassification, as prescribed in section 1.5(a); \n \n \n \n (B) the date that is 10 years from the date of original classification, as prescribed in section 1.5(b); \n \n \n \n (C) the date that is up to 25 years from the date of original classification, as prescribed in section 1.5(b); or \n \n \n \n (D) in the case of information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the marking prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to this order; and \n \n \n \n (5) a concise reason for classification that, at a minimum, cites the applicable classification categories in section 1.4 of this order. \n \n \n \n (b) Specific information required in paragraph (a) of this section may be excluded if it would reveal additional classified information. \n \n \n \n (c) With respect to each classified document, the agency originating the document shall, by marking or other means, indicate which portions are classified, with the applicable classification level, and which portions are unclassified. In accordance with standards prescribed in directives issued under this order, the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office may grant and revoke temporary waivers of this requirement. The Director shall revoke any waiver upon a finding of abuse. \n \n \n \n (d) Markings or other indicia implementing the provisions of this order, including abbreviations and requirements to safeguard classified working papers, shall conform to the standards prescribed in implementing directives issued pursuant to this order. \n \n \n \n (e) Foreign government information shall retain its original classification markings or shall be assigned a U.S. classification that provides a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the entity that furnished the information. Foreign government information retaining its original classification markings need not be assigned a U.S. classification marking provided that the responsible agency determines that the foreign government markings are adequate to meet the purposes served by U.S. classification markings. \n \n \n \n (f) Information assigned a level of classification under this or predecessor orders shall be considered as classified at that level of classification despite the omission of other required markings. Whenever such information is used in the derivative classification process or is reviewed for possible declassification, holders of such information shall coordinate with an appropriate classification authority for the application of omitted markings. \n \n \n \n (g) The classification authority shall, whenever practicable, use a classified addendum whenever classified information constitutes a small portion of an otherwise unclassified document or prepare a product to allow for dissemination at the lowest level of classification possible or in unclassified form. \n \n \n \n (h) Prior to public release, all declassified records shall be appropriately marked to reflect their declassification. \n \n \n \n Sec. 1.7. Classification Prohibitions and Limitations. \n \n (a) In no case shall information be classified, continue to be maintained as classified, or fail to be declassified in order to: \n \n (1) conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative error; \n \n \n \n (2) prevent embarrassment to a person, organization, or agency; \n \n \n \n (3) restrain competition; or \n \n \n \n (4) prevent or delay the release of information that does not require protection in the interest of the national security. \n \n \n \n (b) Basic scientific research information not clearly related to the national security shall not be classified. \n \n \n \n (c) Information may not be reclassified after declassification and release to the public under proper authority unless: \n \n \n \n (1) the reclassification is personally approved in writing by the agency head based on a document-by-document determination by the agency that reclassification is required to prevent significant and demonstrable damage to the national security; \n \n \n \n (2) the information may be reasonably recovered without bringing undue attention to the information; \n \n \n \n (3) the reclassification action is reported promptly to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (National Security Advisor) and the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office; and \n \n \n \n (4) for documents in the physical and legal custody of the National Archives and Records Administration (National Archives) that have been available for public use, the agency head has, after making the determinations required by this paragraph, notified the Archivist of the United States (Archivist), who shall suspend public access pending approval of the reclassification action by the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed by the agency head to the President through the National Security Advisor. Public access shall remain suspended pending a prompt decision on the appeal. \n \n \n \n (d) Information that has not previously been disclosed to the public under proper authority may be classified or reclassified after an agency has received a request for it under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552), the Presidential Records Act, 44 U.S.C. 2204(c)(1), the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), or the mandatory review provisions of section 3.5 of this order only if such classification meets the requirements of this order and is accomplished on a document-by-document basis with the personal participation or under the direction of the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official designated under section 5.4 of this order. The requirements in this paragraph also apply to those situations in which information has been declassified in accordance with a specific date or event determined by an original classification authority in accordance with section 1.5 of this order. \n \n \n \n (e) Compilations of items of information that are individually unclassified may be classified if the compiled information reveals an additional association or relationship that: (1) meets the standards for classification under this order; and (2) is not otherwise revealed in the individual items of information. \n \n \n \n Sec. 1.8. Classification Challenges. (a) Authorized holders of information who, in good faith, believe that its classification status is improper are encouraged and expected to challenge the classification status of the information in accordance with agency procedures established under paragraph (b) of this section. \n \n \n \n (b) In accordance with implementing directives issued pursuant to this order, an agency head or senior agency official shall establish procedures under which authorized holders of information, including authorized holders outside the classifying agency, are encouraged and expected to challenge the classification of information that they believe is improperly classified or unclassified. These procedures shall ensure that: \n \n \n \n (1) individuals are not subject to retribution for bringing such actions; \n \n \n \n (2) an opportunity is provided for review by an impartial official or panel; and \n \n \n \n (3) individuals are advised of their right to appeal agency decisions to the Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel (Panel) established by section 5.3 of this order. \n \n \n \n (c) Documents required to be submitted for prepublication review or other administrative process pursuant to an approved nondisclosure agreement are not covered by this section. \n \n \n \n Sec. 1.9. Fundamental Classification Guidance Review. \n \n (a) Agency heads shall complete on a periodic basis a comprehensive review of the agency's classification guidance, particularly classification guides, to ensure the guidance reflects current circumstances and to identify classified information that no longer requires protection and can be declassified. The initial fundamental classification guidance review shall be completed within 2 years of the effective date of this order. \n \n \n \n (b) The classification guidance review shall include an evaluation of classified information to determine if it meets the standards for classification under section 1.4 of this order, taking into account an up-to-date assessment of likely damage as described under section 1.2 of this order. \n \n \n \n (c) The classification guidance review shall include original classification authorities and agency subject matter experts to ensure a broad range of perspectives. \n \n \n \n (d) Agency heads shall provide a report summarizing the results of the classification guidance review to the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office and shall release an unclassified version of this report to the public. \n \n \n \n PART 2 -- DERIVATIVE CLASSIFICATION \n \n \n \n Sec. 2.1. Use of Derivative Classification. (a) Persons who reproduce, extract, or summarize classified information, or who apply classification markings derived from source material or as directed by a classification guide, need not possess original classification authority. \n \n \n \n (b) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall: \n \n (1) be identified by name and position, or by personal identifier, in a manner that is immediately apparent for each derivative classification action; \n \n \n \n (2) observe and respect original classification decisions; and \n \n \n \n (3) carry forward to any newly created documents the pertinent classification markings. For information derivatively classified based on multiple sources, the derivative classifier shall carry forward: \n \n \n \n (A) the date or event for declassification that corresponds to the longest period of classification among the sources, or the marking established pursuant to section 1.6(a)(4)(D) of this order; and \n \n \n \n (B) a listing of the source materials. \n \n \n \n (c) Derivative classifiers shall, whenever practicable, use a classified addendum whenever classified information constitutes a small portion of an otherwise unclassified document or prepare a product to allow for dissemination at the lowest level of classification possible or in unclassified form. \n \n \n \n (d) Persons who apply derivative classification markings shall receive training in the proper application of the derivative classification principles of the order, with an emphasis on avoiding over-classification, at least once every 2 years. Derivative classifiers who do not receive such training at least once every 2 years shall have their authority to apply derivative classification markings suspended until they have received such training. A waiver may be granted by the agency head, the deputy agency head, or the senior agency official if an individual is unable to receive such training due to unavoidable circumstances. Whenever a waiver is granted, the individual shall receive such training as soon as practicable. \n \n \n \n Sec. 2.2. Classification Guides. (a) Agencies with original classification authority shall prepare classification guides to facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification of information. These guides shall conform to standards contained in directives issued under this order. \n \n \n \n (b) Each guide shall be approved personally and in writing by an official who: \n \n \n \n (1) has program or supervisory responsibility over the information or is the senior agency official; and \n \n \n \n (2) is authorized to classify information originally at the highest level of classification prescribed in the guide. \n \n \n \n (c) Agencies shall establish procedures to ensure that classification guides are reviewed and updated as provided in directives issued under this order. \n \n \n \n (d) Agencies shall incorporate original classification decisions into classification guides on a timely basis and in accordance with directives issued under this order. \n \n \n \n (e) Agencies may incorporate exemptions from automatic declassification approved pursuant to section 3.3(j) of this order into classification guides, provided that the Panel is notified of the intent to take such action for specific information in advance of approval and the information remains in active use. \n \n \n \n (f) The duration of classification of a document classified by a derivative classifier using a classification guide shall not exceed 25 years from the date of the origin of the document, except for: \n \n \n \n (1) information that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction; and \n \n \n \n (2) specific information incorporated into classification guides in accordance with section 2.2(e) of this order. \n \n \n \n PART 3 -- DECLASSIFICATION AND DOWNGRADING \n \n \n \n Sec. 3.1. Authority for Declassification. (a) Information shall be declassified as soon as it no longer meets the standards for classification under this order. \n \n \n \n (b) Information shall be declassified or downgraded by: \n \n \n \n (1) the official who authorized the original classification, if that official is still serving in the same position and has original classification authority; \n \n \n \n (2) the originator's current successor in function, if that individual has original classification authority; \n \n \n \n (3) a supervisory official of either the originator or his or her successor in function, if the supervisory official has original classification authority; or \n \n \n \n (4) officials delegated declassification authority in writing by the agency head or the senior agency official of the originating agency. \n \n \n \n (c) The Director of National Intelligence (or, if delegated by the Director of National Intelligence, the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence) may, with respect to the Intelligence Community, after consultation with the head of the originating Intelligence Community element or department, declassify, downgrade, or direct the declassification or downgrading of information or intelligence relating to intelligence sources, methods, or activities. \n \n \n \n (d) It is presumed that information that continues to meet the classification requirements under this order requires continued protection. In some exceptional cases, however, the need to protect such information may be outweighed by the public interest in disclosure of the information, and in these cases the information should be declassified. When such questions arise, they shall be referred to the agency head or the senior agency official. That official will determine, as an exercise of discretion, whether the public interest in disclosure outweighs the damage to the national security that might reasonably be expected from disclosure. This provision does not: \n \n \n \n (1) amplify or modify the substantive criteria or procedures for classification; or \n \n \n \n (2) create any substantive or procedural rights subject to judicial review. \n \n \n \n (e) If the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office determines that information is classified in violation of this order, the Director may require the information to be declassified by the agency that originated the classification. Any such decision by the Director may be appealed to the President through the National Security Advisor. The information shall remain classified pending a prompt decision on the appeal. \n \n \n \n (f) The provisions of this section shall also apply to agencies that, under the terms of this order, do not have original classification authority, but had such authority under predecessor orders. \n \n \n \n (g) No information may be excluded from declassification under section 3.3 of this order based solely on the type of document or record in which it is found. Rather, the classified information must be considered on the basis of its content. \n \n \n \n (h) Classified nonrecord materials, including artifacts, shall be declassified as soon as they no longer meet the standards for classification under this order. \n \n \n \n (i) When making decisions under sections 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5 of this order, agencies shall consider the final decisions of the Panel. \n \n \n \n Sec. 3.2. Transferred Records. (a) In the case of classified records transferred in conjunction with a transfer of functions, and not merely for storage purposes, the receiving agency shall be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of this order. \n \n \n \n (b) In the case of classified records that are not officially transferred as described in paragraph (a) of this section, but that originated in an agency that has ceased to exist and for which there is no successor agency, each agency in possession of such records shall be deemed to be the originating agency for purposes of this order. Such records may be declassified or downgraded by the agency in possession of the records after consultation with any other agency that has an interest in the subject matter of the records. \n \n \n \n (c) Classified records accessioned into the National Archives shall be declassified or downgraded by the Archivist in accordance with this order, the directives issued pursuant to this order, agency declassification guides, and any existing procedural agreement between the Archivist and the relevant agency head. \n \n \n \n (d) The originating agency shall take all reasonable steps to declassify classified information contained in records determined to have permanent historical value before they are accessioned into the National Archives. However, the Archivist may require that classified records be accessioned into the National Archives when necessary to comply with the provisions of the Federal Records Act. This provision does not apply to records transferred to the Archivist pursuant to section 2203 of title 44, United States Code, or records for which the National Archives serves as the custodian of the records of an agency or organization that has gone out of existence. \n \n \n \n (e) To the extent practicable, agencies shall adopt a system of records management that will facilitate the public release of documents at the time such documents are declassified pursuant to the provisions for automatic declassification in section 3.3 of this order. \n \n \n \n Sec. 3.3. Automatic Declassification. (a) Subject to paragraphs (b)\u2013(d) and (g)\u2013(j) of this section, all classified records that (1) are more than 25 years old and (2) have been determined to have permanent historical value under title 44, United States Code, shall be automatically declassified whether or not the records have been reviewed. All classified records shall be automatically declassified on December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of origin, except as provided in paragraphs (b)\u2013(d) and (g)\u2013(i) of this section. If the date of origin of an individual record cannot be readily determined, the date of original classification shall be used instead. \n \n \n \n (b) An agency head may exempt from automatic declassification under paragraph (a) of this section specific information, the release of which should clearly and demonstrably be expected to: \n \n \n \n (1) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, a human intelligence source, a relationship with an intelligence or security service of a foreign government or international organization, or a nonhuman intelligence source; or impair the effectiveness of an intelligence method currently in use, available for use, or under development; \n \n \n \n (2) reveal information that would assist in the development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction; \n \n \n \n (3) reveal information that would impair U.S. cryptologic systems or activities; \n \n \n \n (4) reveal information that would impair the application of state-of-the-art technology within a U.S. weapon system; \n \n \n \n (5) reveal formally named or numbered U.S. military war plans that remain in effect, or reveal operational or tactical elements of prior plans that are contained in such active plans; \n \n \n \n (6) reveal information, including foreign government information, that would cause serious harm to relations between the United States and a foreign government, or to ongoing diplomatic activities of the United States; \n \n \n \n (7) reveal information that would impair the current ability of United States Government officials to protect the President, Vice President, and other protectees for whom protection services, in the interest of the national security, are authorized; \n \n \n \n (8) reveal information that would seriously impair current national security emergency preparedness plans or reveal current vulnerabilities of systems, installations, or infrastructures relating to the national security; or \n \n \n \n (9) violate a statute, treaty, or international agreement that does not permit the automatic or unilateral declassification of information at 25 years. \n \n \n \n (c)(1) An agency head shall notify the Panel of any specific file series of records for which a review or assessment has determined that the information within that file series almost invariably falls within one or more of the exemption categories listed in paragraph (b) of this section and that the agency proposes to exempt from automatic declassification at 25 years. \n \n \n \n (2) The notification shall include: \n \n \n \n (A) a description of the file series; \n \n \n \n (B) an explanation of why the information within the file series is almost invariably exempt from automatic declassification and why the information must remain classified for a longer period of time; and \n \n \n \n (C) except when the information within the file series almost invariably identifies a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, a specific date or event for declassification of the information, not to exceed December 31 of the year that is 50 years from the date of origin of the records. \n \n \n \n (3) The Panel may direct the agency not to exempt a designated file series or to declassify the information within that series at an earlier date than recommended. The agency head may appeal such a decision to the President through the National Security Advisor. \n \n \n \n (4) File series exemptions approved by the President prior to December 31, 2008, shall remain valid without any additional agency action pending Panel review by the later of December 31, 2010, or December 31 of the year that is 10 years from the date of previous approval. \n \n \n \n (d) The following provisions shall apply to the onset of automatic declassification: \n \n \n \n (1) Classified records within an integral file block, as defined in this order, that are otherwise subject to automatic declassification under this section shall not be automatically declassified until December 31 of the year that is 25 years from the date of the most recent record within the file block. \n \n \n \n (2) After consultation with the Director of the National Declassification Center (the Center) established by section 3.7 of this order and before the records are subject to automatic declassification, an agency head or senior agency official may delay automatic declassification for up to five additional years for classified information contained in media that make a review for possible declassification exemptions more difficult or costly. \n \n \n \n (3) Other than for records that are properly exempted from automatic declassification, records containing classified information that originated with other agencies or the disclosure of which would affect the interests or activities of other agencies with respect to the classified information and could reasonably be expected to fall under one or more of the exemptions in paragraph (b) of this section shall be identified prior to the onset of automatic declassification for later referral to those agencies. \n \n \n \n (A) The information of concern shall be referred by the Center established by section 3.7 of this order, or by the centralized facilities referred to in section 3.7(e) of this order, in a prioritized and scheduled manner determined by the Center. \n \n \n \n (B) If an agency fails to provide a final determination on a referral made by the Center within 1 year of referral, or by the centralized facilities referred to in section 3.7(e) of this order within 3 years of referral, its equities in the referred records shall be automatically declassified. \n \n \n \n (C) If any disagreement arises between affected agencies and the Center regarding the referral review period, the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office shall determine the appropriate period of review of referred records. \n \n \n \n (D) Referrals identified prior to the establishment of the Center by section 3.7 of this order shall be subject to automatic declassification only in accordance with subparagraphs (d)(3)(A)\u2013(C) of this section. \n \n \n \n (4) After consultation with the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, an agency head may delay automatic declassification for up to 3 years from the date of discovery of classified records that were inadvertently not reviewed prior to the effective date of automatic declassification. \n \n \n \n (e) Information exempted from automatic declassification under this section shall remain subject to the mandatory and systematic declassification review provisions of this order. \n \n \n \n (f) The Secretary of State shall determine when the United States should commence negotiations with the appropriate officials of a foreign government or international organization of governments to modify any treaty or international agreement that requires the classification of information contained in records affected by this section for a period longer than 25 years from the date of its creation, unless the treaty or international agreement pertains to information that may otherwise remain classified beyond 25 years under this section. \n \n \n \n (g) The Secretary of Energy shall determine when information concerning foreign nuclear programs that was removed from the Restricted Data category in order to carry out provisions of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, may be declassified. Unless otherwise determined, such information shall be declassified when comparable information concerning the United States nuclear program is declassified. \n \n \n \n (h) Not later than 3 years from the effective date of this order, all records exempted from automatic declassification under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section shall be automatically declassified on December 31 of a year that is no more than 50 years from the date of origin, subject to the following: \n \n \n \n (1) Records that contain information the release of which should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the following are exempt from automatic declassification at 50 years: \n \n \n \n (A) the identity of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source; or \n \n (B) key design concepts of weapons of mass destruction. \n \n \n \n (2) In extraordinary cases, agency heads may, within 5 years of the onset of automatic declassification, propose to exempt additional specific information from declassification at 50 years. \n \n \n \n (3) Records exempted from automatic declassification under this paragraph shall be automatically declassified on December 31 of a year that is no more than 75 years from the date of origin unless an agency head, within 5 years of that date, proposes to exempt specific information from declassification at 75 years and the proposal is formally approved by the Panel. \n \n \n \n (i) Specific records exempted from automatic declassification prior to the establishment of the Center described in section 3.7 of this order shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) of this section in a scheduled and prioritized manner determined by the Center. \n \n \n \n (j) At least 1 year before information is subject to automatic declassification under this section, an agency head or senior agency official shall notify the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, serving as Executive Secretary of the Panel, of any specific information that the agency proposes to exempt from automatic declassification under paragraphs (b) and (h) of this section. \n \n \n \n (1) The notification shall include: \n \n \n \n (A) a detailed description of the information, either by reference to information in specific records or in the form of a declassification guide; \n \n \n \n (B) an explanation of why the information should be exempt from automatic declassification and must remain classified for a longer period of time; and \n \n \n \n (C) a specific date or a specific and independently verifiable event for automatic declassification of specific records that contain the information proposed for exemption. \n \n \n \n (2) The Panel may direct the agency not to exempt the information or to declassify it at an earlier date than recommended. An agency head may appeal such a decision to the President through the National Security Advisor. The information will remain classified while such an appeal is pending. \n \n \n \n (k) For information in a file series of records determined not to have permanent historical value, the duration of classification beyond 25 years shall be the same as the disposition (destruction) date of those records in each Agency Records Control Schedule or General Records Schedule, although the duration of classification shall be extended if the record has been retained for business reasons beyond the scheduled disposition date. \n \n \n \n Sec. 3.4. Systematic Declassification Review. (a) Each agency that has originated classified information under this order or its predecessors shall establish and conduct a program for systematic declassification review for records of permanent historical value exempted from automatic declassification under section 3.3 of this order. Agencies shall prioritize their review of such records in accordance with priorities established by the Center. \n \n \n \n (b) The Archivist shall conduct a systematic declassification review program for classified records: (1) accessioned into the National Archives; (2) transferred to the Archivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2203; and (3) for which the National Archives serves as the custodian for an agency or organization that has gone out of existence. \n \n \n \n Sec. 3.5. Mandatory Declassification Review. (a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, all information classified under this order or predecessor orders shall be subject to a review for declassification by the originating agency if: \n \n \n \n (1) the request for a review describes the document or material containing the information with sufficient specificity to enable the agency to locate it with a reasonable amount of effort; \n \n \n \n (2) the document or material containing the information responsive to the request is not contained within an operational file exempted from search and review, publication, and disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 in accordance with law; and \n \n \n \n (3) the information is not the subject of pending litigation. \n \n \n \n (b) Information originated by the incumbent President or the incumbent Vice President; the incumbent President's White House Staff or the incumbent Vice President's Staff; committees, commissions, or boards appointed by the incumbent President; or other entities within the Executive Office of the President that solely advise and assist the incumbent President is exempted from the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. However, the Archivist shall have the authority to review, downgrade, and declassify papers or records of former Presidents and Vice Presidents under the control of the Archivist pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 2107, 2111, 2111 note, or 2203. Review procedures developed by the Archivist shall provide for consultation with agencies having primary subject matter interest and shall be consistent with the provisions of applicable laws or lawful agreements that pertain to the respective Presidential papers or records. Agencies with primary subject matter interest shall be notified promptly of the Archivist's decision. Any final decision by the Archivist may be appealed by the requester or an agency to the Panel. The information shall remain classified pending a prompt decision on the appeal. \n \n \n \n (c) Agencies conducting a mandatory review for declassification shall declassify information that no longer meets the standards for classification under this order. They shall release this information unless withholding is otherwise authorized and warranted under applicable law. \n \n \n \n (d) If an agency has reviewed the requested information for declassification within the past 2 years, the agency need not conduct another review and may instead inform the requester of this fact and the prior review decision and advise the requester of appeal rights provided under subsection (e) of this section. \n \n \n \n (e) In accordance with directives issued pursuant to this order, agency heads shall develop procedures to process requests for the mandatory review of classified information. These procedures shall apply to information classified under this or predecessor orders. They also shall provide a means for administratively appealing a denial of a mandatory review request, and for notifying the requester of the right to appeal a final agency decision to the Panel. \n \n \n \n (f) After consultation with affected agencies, the Secretary of Defense shall develop special procedures for the review of cryptologic information; the Director of National Intelligence shall develop special procedures for the review of information pertaining to intelligence sources, methods, and activities; and the Archivist shall develop special procedures for the review of information accessioned into the National Archives. \n \n \n \n (g) Documents required to be submitted for prepublication review or other administrative process pursuant to an approved nondisclosure agreement are not covered by this section. \n \n \n \n (h) This section shall not apply to any request for a review made to an element of the Intelligence Community that is made by a person other than an individual as that term is defined by 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(2), or by a foreign government entity or any representative thereof. \n \n \n \n Sec. 3.6. Processing Requests and Reviews. Notwithstanding section 4.1(i) of this order, in response to a request for information under the Freedom of Information Act, the Presidential Records Act, the Privacy Act of 1974, or the mandatory review provisions of this order: \n \n \n \n (a) An agency may refuse to confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of requested records whenever the fact of their existence or nonexistence is itself classified under this order or its predecessors. \n \n \n \n (b) When an agency receives any request for documents in its custody that contain classified information that originated with other agencies or the disclosure of which would affect the interests or activities of other agencies with respect to the classified information, or identifies such documents in the process of implementing sections 3.3 or 3.4 of this order, it shall refer copies of any request and the pertinent documents to the originating agency for processing and may, after consultation with the originating agency, inform any requester of the referral unless such association is itself classified under this order or its predecessors. In cases in which the originating agency determines in writing that a response under paragraph (a) of this section is required, the referring agency shall respond to the requester in accordance with that paragraph. \n \n \n \n (c) Agencies may extend the classification of information in records determined not to have permanent historical value or nonrecord materials, including artifacts, beyond the time frames established in sections 1.5(b) and 2.2(f) of this order, provided: \n \n \n \n (1) the specific information has been approved pursuant to section 3.3(j) of this order for exemption from automatic declassification; and \n \n \n \n (2) the extension does not exceed the date established in section 3.3(j) of this order. \n \n \n \n Sec. 3.7. National Declassification Center (a) There is established within the National Archives a National Declassification Center to streamline declassification processes, facilitate quality-assurance measures, and implement standardized training regarding the declassification of records determined to have permanent historical value. There shall be a Director of the Center who shall be appointed or removed by the Archivist in consultation with the Secretaries of State, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence. \n \n \n \n (b) Under the administration of the Director, the Center shall coordinate: \n \n \n \n (1) timely and appropriate processing of referrals in accordance with section 3.3(d)(3) of this order for accessioned Federal records and transferred presidential records. \n \n \n \n (2) general interagency declassification activities necessary to fulfill the requirements of sections 3.3 and 3.4 of this order; \n \n \n \n (3) the exchange among agencies of detailed declassification guidance to enable the referral of records in accordance with section 3.3(d)(3) of this order; \n \n \n \n (4) the development of effective, transparent, and standard declassification work processes, training, and quality assurance measures; \n \n \n \n (5) the development of solutions to declassification challenges posed by electronic records, special media, and emerging technologies; \n \n \n \n (6) the linkage and effective utilization of existing agency databases and the use of new technologies to document and make public declassification review decisions and support declassification activities under the purview of the Center; and \n \n \n \n (7) storage and related services, on a reimbursable basis, for Federal records containing classified national security information. \n \n \n \n (c) Agency heads shall fully cooperate with the Archivist in the activities of the Center and shall: \n \n \n \n (1) provide the Director with adequate and current declassification guidance to enable the referral of records in accordance with section 3.3(d)(3) of this order; and \n \n \n \n (2) upon request of the Archivist, assign agency personnel to the Center who shall be delegated authority by the agency head to review and exempt or declassify information originated by their agency contained in records accessioned into the National Archives, after consultation with subject-matter experts as necessary. \n \n \n \n (d) The Archivist, in consultation with representatives of the participants in the Center and after input from the general public, shall develop priorities for declassification activities under the purview of the Center that take into account the degree of researcher interest and the likelihood of declassification. \n \n \n \n (e) Agency heads may establish such centralized facilities and internal operations to conduct internal declassification reviews as appropriate to achieve optimized records management and declassification business processes. Once established, all referral processing of accessioned records shall take place at the Center, and such agency facilities and operations shall be coordinated with the Center to ensure the maximum degree of consistency in policies and procedures that relate to records determined to have permanent historical value. \n \n \n \n (f) Agency heads may exempt from automatic declassification or continue the classification of their own originally classified information under section 3.3(a) of this order except that in the case of the Director of National Intelligence, the Director shall also retain such authority with respect to the Intelligence Community. \n \n \n \n (g) The Archivist shall, in consultation with the Secretaries of State, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security, the Attorney General, the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Director of the Information Security Oversight Office, provide the National Security Advisor with a detailed concept of operations for the Center and a proposed implementing directive under section 5.1 of this order that reflects the coordinated views of the aforementioned agencies. \n \n \n \n PART 4 -- SAFEGUARDING \n \n \n \n Sec. 4.1. General Restrictions on Access. (a) A person may have access to classified information provided that: \n \n \n \n (1) a favorable determination of eligibility for access has been made by an agency head or the agency head's designee; \n \n \n \n (2) the person has signed an approved nondisclosure agreement; and \n \n \n \n (3) the person has a need-to-know the information. \n \n \n \n (b) Every person who has met the standards for access to classified information in paragraph (a) of this section shall receive contemporaneous training on the proper safeguarding of classified information and on the criminal, civil, and administrative sanctions that may be imposed on an individual who fails to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure. \n \n \n \n (c) An official or employee leaving agency service may not remove classified information from the agency's control or direct that information be declassified in order to remove it from agency control. \n \n \n \n (d) Classified information may not be removed from official premises without proper authorization. \n \n \n \n (e) Persons authorized to disseminate classified information outside the executive branch shall ensure the protection of the information in a manner equivalent to that provided within the executive branch. \n \n \n \n (f) Consistent with law, executive orders, directives, and regulations, an agency head or senior agency official or, with respect to the Intelligence Community, the Director of National Intelligence, shall establish uniform procedures to ensure that automated information systems, including networks and telecommunications systems, that collect, create, communicate, compute, disseminate, process, or store classified information: \n \n \n \n (1) prevent access by unauthorized persons; \n \n \n \n (2) ensure the integrity of the information; and \n \n \n \n (3) to the maximum extent practicable, use: \n \n \n \n (A) common information technology standards, protocols, and interfaces that maximize the availability of, and access to, the information in a form and manner that facilitates its authorized use; and \n \n \n \n (B) standardized electronic formats to maximize the accessibility of information to persons who meet the criteria set forth in section 4.1(a) of this order. \n \n \n \n (g) Consistent with law, executive orders, directives, and regulations, each agency head or senior agency official, or with respect to the Intelligence Community, the Director of National Intelligence, shall establish controls to ensure that classified information is used, processed, stored, reproduced, transmitted, and destroyed under conditions that provide adequate protection and prevent access by unauthorized persons. \n \n \n \n (h) Consistent with directives issued pursuant to this order, an agency shall safeguard foreign government information under standards that provide a degree of protection at least equivalent to that required by the government or international organization of governments that furnished the information. When adequate to achieve equivalency, these standards may be less restrictive than the safeguarding standards that ordinarily apply to U.S. \"Confidential\" information, including modified handling and transmission and allowing access to individuals with a need-to-know who have not otherwise been cleared for access to classified information or executed an approved nondisclosure agreement. \n \n \n \n (i)(1) Classified information originating in one agency may be disseminated to another agency or U.S. entity by any agency to which it has been made available without the consent of the originating agency, as long as the criteria for access under section 4.1(a) of this order are met, unless the originating agency has determined that prior authorization is required for such dissemination and has marked or indicated such requirement on the medium containing the classified information in accordance with implementing directives issued pursuant to this order. \n \n \n \n (2) Classified information originating in one agency may be disseminated by any other agency to which it has been made available to a foreign government in accordance with statute, this order, directives implementing this order, direction of the President, or with the consent of the originating agency. For the purposes of this section, \"foreign government\" includes any element of a foreign government, or an international organization of governments, or any element thereof. \n \n \n \n (3) Documents created prior to the effective date of this order shall not be disseminated outside any other agency to which they have been made available without the consent of the originating agency. An agency head or senior agency official may waive this requirement for specific information that originated within that agency. \n \n \n \n (4) For purposes of this section, the Department of Defense shall be considered one agency, except that any dissemination of information regarding intelligence sources, methods, or activities shall be consistent with directives issued pursuant to section 6.2(b) of this order. \n \n \n \n (5) Prior consent of the originating agency is not required when referring records for declassification review that contain information originating in more than one agency. \n \n \n \n Sec. 4.2. Distribution Controls. (a) The head of each agency shall establish procedures in accordance with applicable law and consistent with directives issued pursuant to this order to ensure that classified information is accessible to the maximum extent possible by individuals who meet the criteria set forth in section 4.1(a) of this order. \n \n \n \n (b) In an emergency, when necessary to respond to an imminent threat to life or in defense of the homeland, the agency head or any designee may authorize the disclosure of classified information (including information marked pursuant to section 4.1(i)(1) of this order) to an individual or individuals who are otherwise not eligible for access. Such actions shall be taken only in accordance with directives implementing this order and any procedure issued by agencies governing the classified information, which shall be designed to minimize the classified information that is disclosed under these circumstances and the number of individuals who receive it. Information disclosed under this provision or implementing directives and procedures shall not be deemed declassified as a result of such disclosure or subsequent use by a recipient. Such disclosures shall be reported promptly to the originator of the classified information. For purposes of this section, the Director of National Intelligence may issue an implementing directive governing the emergency disclosure of classified intelligence information. \n \n \n \n (c) Each agency shall update, at least annually, the automatic, routine, or recurring distribution mechanism for classified information that it distributes. Recipients shall cooperate fully with distributors who are updating distribution lists and shall notify distributors whenever a relevant change in status occurs. \n \n \n \n Sec. 4.3. Special Access Programs. (a) Establishment of special access programs. Unless otherwise authorized by the President, only the Secretaries of State, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and the Director of National Intelligence, or the principal deputy of each, may create a special access program. For special access programs pertaining to intelligence sources, methods, and activities (but not including military operational, strategic, and tactical programs), this function shall be exercised by the Director of National Intelligence. These officials shall keep the number of these programs at an absolute minimum, and shall establish them only when the program is required by statute or upon a specific finding that: \n \n \n \n (1) the vulnerability of, or threat to, specific information is exceptional; and \n \n \n \n (2) the normal criteria for determining eligibility for access applicable to information classified at the same level are not deemed sufficient to protect the information from unauthorized disclosure. \n \n \n \n (b) Requirements and limitations.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Since July, Hillary Clinton's team has been fighting findings by the intelligence community's inspector general that she housed classified information on her private email server. But a special intelligence review by the CIA and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency just bolstered the original proclamation, finding that two emails she received in 2009 and 2011 via that server were considered \"Top Secret,\" including an email about North Korea's nukes, the New York Times reports, citing senior intelligence officials speaking anonymously. Clinton's campaign is doubling down, however, with a rep accusing the discovery process of being tainted by \"bureaucratic infighting\" and a State Department spokesman proclaiming that \"classification is rarely a black and white question. \u2026 At this time, any conclusion about the classification of the documents in question would be premature.\" The \"Top Secret\" designation, signed off on by President Obama in a 2009 executive order, is bestowed on info that, if revealed, \"could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to \u2026 national security.\" But Clinton herself backed up her rep's assessment, telling the AP yesterday in Iowa that \"there is always a debate among different agencies about [whether] something should be retroactively [marked classified].\" When asked why she isn't offering up any direct apologies, she added, \"What I did was allowed. It was allowed by the State Department. The State Department has confirmed that. I did not send or receive any information marked classified. I take the responsibilities of handling classified materials very seriously and did so.\" (Clinton did recently apologize for this matter being \"confusing to people.\")",

    "document": "For the first time since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, federal airport screeners will allow passengers to carry onto a plane small knives, as well as golf clubs, hockey sticks and pool cues. \n \n The policy change, which will take effect April 25, was immediately criticized by flight attendants, who say the move will create an unnecessary risk and further crowd the already limited space in the overhead bins. \n \n \"While we agree that a passenger wielding a small knife or swinging a golf club or hockey stick poses less of a threat to the pilot locked in the cockpit, these are real threats to passengers and flight attendants in the passenger cabin,\" said Stacy K. Martin, president of Southwest Airlines\u2019 flight attendants union, TWU Local 556. \n \n In a statement, the Transportation Security Administration said the change will help align the list of prohibited items on U.S. flights with those of international carriers and cut the time passengers spend going through security screening. \n \n \"This change allows TSA to focus on the threats that can cause catastrophic damage to an aircraft,\" the TSA said. \n \n The change will remove from the TSA list of prohibited items small knives -- with blades less than 2.36 inches or 6 centimeters long

Security Administration will still prohibit some knives,... Read More \n \n The U.S. Transportation Security Administration will still prohibit some knives, including those with locking blades or molded handles. Close \n \n The U.S. Transportation Security Administration will let people carry small pocketknives onto passenger planes for the first time since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, along with golf clubs, hockey sticks and plastic Wiffle Ball-style bats. \n \n The agency will permit knives with retractable blades shorter than 6 centimeters (2.36 inches) and narrower than 1/2 inch, TSA Administrator John Pistole said today at an aviation security conference in Brooklyn. The change, to conform with international rules, takes effect April 25. \n \n Passengers will also be allowed to board flights with some other items that are currently prohibited, including sticks used to play lacrosse, billiards and hockey, ski poles and as many as two golf clubs, Pistole said. \n \n The changes attracted criticism from labor unions representing flight attendants. \n \n \u201cThis policy was designed to make the lives of TSA staff easier, but not make flights safer,\u201d Stacy Martin, president of the Transportation Workers Union local that represents Southwest Airlines Co. flight attendants, said in a statement. \n \n \u201cWhile we agree that a passenger wielding a small knife or swinging a golf club or hockey stick poses less of a threat to the pilot locked in the cockpit, these are real threats to passengers and flight attendants in the passenger cabin,\u201d Martin said. \n \n \u2018Shortsighted Decision\u2019 \n \n Pistole\u2019s announcement reflects \u201ca poor and shortsighted decision by the TSA,\u201d the Flight Attendants Union Coalition, representing five labor groups, said in a statement. \u201cWe believe that these proposed changes will further endanger the lives of all flight attendants and the passengers we work so hard to keep safe and secure.\u201d \n \n Changes removing items like sporting goods from the prohibited list are based on recommendations from a TSA working group that\u2019s trying to weed out commonly confiscated items that don\u2019t present a security threat, agency spokesman David Castelveter said. \n \n \u201cThese are popular items we see regularly,\u201d Castelveter said. \u201cThey don\u2019t present a risk to transportation security.\u201d \n \n Pistole, the former No. 2 official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has stressed the use of intelligence and \u201crisk- based\u201d security during his tenure leading TSA. The agency is moving away from uniform procedures that apply to every passenger and toward efforts to perform background checks on passengers before they arrive at an airport. \n \n Speeding Checkpoints \n \n Besides conforming with international rules, the TSA policy changes will keep U.S. checkpoint officials from spending time confiscating objects that don\u2019t present a risk, Pistole said. The changes will let more passengers go through screening lines more quickly, he said. \n \n \u201cThe idea that we have to look for, to find and then somehow resolve whatever that prohibited item is -- that takes time and effort,\u201d Pistole said. \u201cThat may detract us from that item that could lead to a catastrophic failure on an aircraft.\u201d \n \n The greatest threat to U.S. travelers is currently small, non-metallic bombs, not knives or sporting equipment, Pistole said. \n \n Overseas passengers will no longer have to check the qualifying knives as they pass through the U.S. \n \n The agency will still prohibit some knives, including those with locking blades or molded handles, like those used by hunters for skinning, Pistole said. There\u2019s still concern about knives clearly intended for use as weapons, he said. \n \n Box Cutters \n \n Box cutters, like those used by the Sept. 11 terrorists, and razor blades will still be banned. \n \n \u201cThe sensitivity to those who were attacked on 9/11 still resonates strongly,\u201d Pistole said. \u201cThere\u2019s just too much emotion associated with them, particularly the box cutters.\u201d \n \n The agency also is carving out two exceptions to its ban on most baseball and softball bats. It will allow souvenir, novelty baseball bats less than 24 inches long and will permit lightweight plastic bats even if they\u2019re more than 2 feet long (61 centimeters). \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Jeff Plungis in Washington at jplungis@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Bernard Kohn at bkohn2@bloomberg.net",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The TSA is loosening up a bit on what passengers can carry with them onto planes. Starting April 25, it will once again be OK to bring small pocketknives (with blades no more than 2.36 inches long and a half-inch wide), along with some kinds of sports equipment\u2014including golf clubs, hockey and lacrosse sticks, pool cues, and plastic wiffle bats, reports Bloomberg. The federal agency says those are among the items commonly confiscated that are no longer perceived to be a security threat. It wants to focus instead on items that can cause \"catastrophic damage.\" The rationale isn't sitting well with flight attendants, reports the Los Angeles Times. \"While we agree that a passenger wielding a small knife or swinging a golf club or hockey stick poses less of a threat to the pilot locked in the cockpit, these are real threats to passengers and flight attendants in the passenger cabin,\" says one union leader. The only thing this change does is make things easier for TSA screeners, she adds.",

    "document": "Melissa Gilbert signed her new cookbook, \"My Prairie Cookbook\" at Barnes & Noble in Brighton, Michigan on December 3, 2014. (Photo: Detroit News file) \n \n Howell \u2014 Actress Melissa Gilbert, the \"Little House on the Prairie\" star whose move to Howell two years ago brought a dash of Hollywood glamour to Livingston County, is more than a half pint short on her federal taxes. \n \n The Internal Revenue Service recently accused her of failing to pay more than $360,000 in federal income taxes, a debt that is emerging one week after Gilbert announced she and her family are moving out of their rented home near downtown Howell. \n \n Gilbert, 51, blamed the tax debt on a stalled acting career, the economy and divorce. \n \n \"Like so many people across the nation, the recession hit me hard,\" Gilbert said in a statement to The Detroit News. \"That, plus a divorce and a dearth of acting opportunities the last few years, created a perfect storm of financial difficulty for me.\" \n \n Gilbert, along with husband and fellow actor Timothy Busfield and two younger boys, are moving into a log house in an unspecified part of Livingston County, or as she wrote in a tweet last week \"our own Little House in the Big Woods.\" \n \n Her husband said the move from Howell is unrelated to the tax debt. \n \n \"(The debt) has more to do with the housing crash and divorce in the past,\" Busfield told The News. \"It's a product of what happened with the economy. It's unfortunate and it's been happening a lot. It's not a big deal.\" \n \n Gilbert said she has negotiated a payment plan with the IRS. \n \n \"I've set up an installment plan to fully pay off my debt and will continue to work as hard as I can to erase this debt and dig myself out of this hole,\" she said. \"I am absolutely positive that I can do it.\" \n \n Gilbert and East Lansing native Busfield \u2014 known for television roles in \"thirtysomething\" and \"West Wing\" and in the films \"Revenge of the Nerds\" and \"Field of Dreams\" \u2014 moved to Michigan about three months after they were married in April 2013. \n \n Gilbert has a history of tax problems that followed her from California to Michigan. The state of California has filed $112,527 worth of tax liens against her since 2013. \n \n A tax lien gives the government a legal claim to all of Gilbert's property, everything from vehicles to homes and income. \n \n The IRS filed a $360,551 tax lien against Gilbert on Feb. 3. She owes federal income taxes from 2011, 2012 and 2013, according to the lien, which is filed with the Livingston County Register of Deeds. \n \n According to the IRS, Gilbert owes $219,989 in income taxes from 2011. She owes $99,405 from 2012 \u2014 the year she appeared on \"Dancing With the Stars\" \u2014 and $41,157 in taxes from 2013, according to the tax lien. \n \n Gilbert went through a period of change during the three years covered by the tax lien. She filed for divorce from Bruce Boxleitner in 2011 and competed on \"Dancing With the Stars\" the next year. \n \n Since she and Busfield arrived in Michigan, they have rented a three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot Victorian home built in 1890 and located two blocks from downtown Howell. \n \n \"Oh, my God, they're great,\" landlord and property owner Brenda Korth said. \"It's been fine. It's been fun.\" \n \n Korth rented the home to Gilbert, thinking the Hollywood couple would stay for one year. \n \n \"It turned into two years and that was fine but I'm really ready to move home,\" the General Motors environmental engineer told The News. \n \n \"If they've been having financial problems, that's not known to me,\" she added. \"The rent's always been paid on time. They've been great tenants.\" \n \n Gilbert and her husband are kind, she said, and have been welcomed by people in Howell. \n \n \"I'm so glad they're in town; everybody has been excited about it,\" Korth said. \n \n Gilbert did not explain what prompted the pending move out of Howell. \n \n \"We are moving but we are not leaving,\" Gilbert tweeted Friday in response to a well-wisher. \"We will be around. We love Howell. We love Livingston Co.\" \n \n While in Michigan, Gilbert has written a cookbook called \"My Prairie Cookbook,\" inspired by the voracious but picky eating habits of her sons. She has done at least one book signing in Livingston County. \n \n The couple also has continued to pursue acting and directing careers. The couple guest starred on a late April episode of the NBC series \"The Night Shift\" that Busfield also directed. \n \n In January, Gilbert participated in a charity fundraiser in Howell for Yatooma's Foundation For the Kids, a charity that raises money for children who have lost a parent. \n \n \"We're thrilled she's here,\" Bloomfield Hills lawyer Norman Yatooma said. \"She's every bit the class act in person that her fans have come to love from the comfort of their couches.\" \n \n rsnell@detroitnews.com \n \n (313) 222-2028 \n \n Read or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1JJku94 ||||| Dolce and Gabbana \n \n Even the stars don't always have their finances in order.

(AP) \u2014 In recent weeks, Dylann Storm Roof reconnected with a childhood buddy he hadn't seen in five years and started railing about the Trayvon Martin case, about black people \"taking over the world\" and about the need for someone to do something about it for the sake of \"the white race,\" the friend said Thursday. \n \n Charleston Emergency Management Director Mark Wilbert holds a flier distributed to media, Thursday, June 18, 2015, with surveillance footage of a suspect wanted in the connection of a shooting Wednesday...

(AP Photo/Chuck Burton) (Associated Press) \n \n On Thursday, Roof, 21, was arrested in the shooting deaths of nine people during a prayer meeting at a historic black church in Charleston \u2014 an attack decried by stunned community leaders and politicians as a hate crime. \n \n In the hours after the Wednesday night bloodbath, a portrait began to take shape of Roof as someone with racist views and at least two recent run-ins with the law. On his Facebook page, the young white man wore a jacket with the flags of the former white-racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia. \n \n In an interview with The Associated Press, Joseph Meek Jr. said he and Roof had been best friends in middle school but lost touch when Roof moved away about five years ago. The two reconnected a few weeks ago after Roof reached out to Meek on Facebook, Meek said. \n \n Roof never talked about race years ago when they were friends, but recently made remarks out of the blue about the killing of unarmed black 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida and the riots in Baltimore over the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, Meek said. \n \n \"He said blacks were taking over the world. Someone needed to do something about it for the white race,\" Meek said. \"He said he wanted segregation between whites and blacks. I said, 'That's not the way it should be.' But he kept talking about it.\" \n \n He said that when he woke up Wednesday morning, Roof was at his house, sleeping in his car outside. Later that day, Meek went to a lake with a couple of other people, but Roof hated the outdoors and decided he would rather go see a movie. \n \n Meek said he didn't see his friend again until a surveillance-camera image of a young man with a soup-bowl haircut was broadcast on television Thursday morning in the wake of the shooting. Meek said he didn't think twice about calling authorities. \n \n \"I didn't THINK it was him. I KNEW it was him,\" he said. \n \n The Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group that tracks hate organizations and extremists, said it was not aware of Roof before the rampage. And some other friends interviewed said they did not know him to be racist. \n \n \"I never thought he'd do something like this,\" said high school friend Antonio Metze, 19. \"He had black friends.\" \n \n Roof used to skateboard while growing up in the Lexington area and had long hair back then. He attended high school in Lexington and in nearby Columbia from 2008 to 2010, school officials said. It was not immediately clear whether he graduated. \n \n \"He was pretty smart,\" Metze said. \n \n Meek's mother, Kimberly Konzny, said she and her son instantly recognized Roof in the surveillance camera image because Roof had the same stained sweatshirt he wore while playing Xbox video games in their home recently. It was stained because he had worked at a landscaping and pest control business, she said. \n \n \"I don't know what was going through his head,\" she said. \"He was a really sweet kid. He was quiet. He only had a few friends.\" \n \n State court records for Roof as an adult show a felony drug case from March that was pending against him and a misdemeanor trespassing charge from April. Authorities had no immediate details. As for any earlier offenses, juvenile records are generally sealed in South Carolina. \n \n Court records list no attorney for him. \n \n Meek said Roof's mother and her boyfriend live in Lexington, and his father lives in Columbia. \n \n Roof displayed a Confederate flag on his license plate, according to Konzny, but that is not unusual in the South. \n \n His Facebook profile picture showed him wearing a jacket with a green-and-white flag patch, the emblem of white-ruled Rhodesia, the African country that became Zimbabwe in 1980. Another patch showed the South African flag from the era of white minority rule that ended in the 1990s. \n \n In Montgomery, Alabama, the president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, Richard Cohen, said it is unclear whether Roof had any connection to any of the 16 white supremacist organizations the SPLC has identified as operating in South Carolina. \n \n But Cohen said that based on Roof's Facebook page, he appeared to be a \"disaffected white supremacist.\" \n \n In a statement, Cohen said the church attack is a reminder that while the post-Sept. 11 U.S. is focused on jihadi terrorism, the threat of homegrown extremism is \"very real.\" Since 2000, the SPLC has seen an increase in the number of hate groups in the U.S., Cohen said. \n \n \"The increase has been driven by a backlash to the country's increasing racial diversity, an increase symbolized for many by the presence of an African American in the White House,\" he said. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Jay Reeves in Alabama contributed to this story.",

(University of Maine) \n \n Gordon Hamilton, a prominent climate scientist who studied Earth's melting ice sheets, died Saturday when his snowmobile went into a crevasse in Antarctica, according to the National Science Foundation. He was 50. \n \n Hamilton was a researcher with the NSF-managed U.S. Antarctic Program studying the stability of the ice shelves near McMurdo Station, a research center on Ross Island, 2,500 miles south of New Zealand. \n \n He and his team were camped in a heavily-crevassed area known as the McMurdo shear zone, where the Ross and McMurdo ice shelves meet. Three miles wide and more than 125 miles long, this perilous zone bisects the compacted snow road to the station. The ice there is hundreds of feet thick and striated with fractures. Hamilton and his colleagues have worked for several years to map this region with robots and ground-penetrating radar, identifying crevasses to be repaired so that vehicles can haul supplies and equipment from the coast to McMurdo station. \n \n Hamilton was driving a snow machine when he hit a crevasse and fell 100 feet into the ice. The circumstances of the accident are still unclear, but NSF spokesman Peter West said that some crevasses are covered in snow and are difficult to spot from ground level. Some of Hamilton's colleagues are working to develop robots capable of detecting buried crevasses for that reason. \n \n Hamilton's body has been recovered and will be returned to his family in Orono, Maine, the NSF said. \n \n [Plane takes off from the South Pole in rare, risky effort to rescue sick workers] \n \n Hamilton was born in Scotland and held degrees from the University of Aberdeen and the University of Cambridge. Since 2005, he has been an associate professor at the University of Maine's School of Earth and Climate Sciences. In a statement Monday, university President Susan Hunter said that his glaciology research was \u201csecond to none.\u201d \n \n \u201cHe leaves a legacy as an outstanding scientist, and a caring mentor and well-known teacher to undergraduate and graduate students,\u201d she said. \n \n Hamilton spent years surveying the glaciers around Greenland and Antarctica, aiming to understand how they might contribute to sea level rise. This was his latest of several expeditions to Antarctica. \n \n The NSF said that Hamilton and all members of his team received crevasse and glacial safety training before going into the shear zone. The Antarctic Program also assigned mountaineers who were familiar with the zone to accompany Hamilton's science team and the crevasse remediation team, which was camped 200 yards away. \n \n The two teams had spent the week identifying and filling in crevasses in the area, and were about to start work on a new crevasse when Hamilton died. \n \n The U.S. Antarctic Program has opened an accident investigation of Hamilton's death. Hamilton's colleagues are currently preparing to leave the field, West said. \n \n Deaths in Antarctica are rare, but research at the poles is always risky. Earlier this year, two sick workers at the South Pole had to be evacuated under the cover of complete darkness during the six-month Antarctic night. \n \n \u201cThe U.S. Antarctic Program is a close-knit corps of researchers and support personnel who carry out the nation\u2019s program of research in Antarctica, working at the frontiers of human knowledge, but also at the physical frontiers of human experience,\u201d Kelly Falkner, director of polar programs for the NSF, said in a statement. \u201cThe death of one of our colleagues is a tragic reminder of the risks we all face \u2014 no matter how hard we work at mitigating those risks \u2014 in field research.\u201d \n \n Hamilton is survived by his wife, Fiona, and their two children, Martin and Calum. \n \n Read more: \n \n This Antarctic glacier is the biggest threat for rising sea levels.

County officials also could not be reached for comment Tuesday night. \n \n After police dropped him off, Fedden, the owner of a popular local deli where cops were known to receive big discounts, drove off in one of the three cars parked in his driveway, according to the lawsuit.

According to the complaint, Fedden, 29, started the night of July 30, 2013, at 9:30 p.m. at the Ruby Tuesday's bar. There, he was served two of \"his usual beverage\" -- about 10 ounces of Jack Daniel's whiskey in a 16-ounce glass with a splash of soda and ice -- before he left the bar about 11 p.m. with another male customer, the suit says. \n \n A spokesman for Ruby Tuesday could not be reached for comment Tuesday night. \n \n advertisement | advertise on newsday \n \n From there, they drove directly around the corner to Fedden's deli, Commack Breakfast, where they were met by a female bartender, the lawsuit says. Together, they smoked marijuana, the lawsuit says. \n \n Soon after, the three left in Fedden's car to pick up more marijuana, the suit says. Fedden was driving \"in excess of 90 miles per hour\" and about 11:30 p.m., they crashed. His car went across two lawns, through a fence and into a parked car, which then spun into a home in Commack, causing $10,000 worth of damage, the complaint says. \n \n At least seven Suffolk police officers responded, but no photographs or witness statements were taken, the complaint says. After the two passengers said they weren't hurt, officers told them to \"get the hell out of here,\" and put Fedden in the back of a police car, the complaint says. \n \n \"Peter served many Suffolk County police officers at his deli, and it was known throughout the local officers that Peter charged only $1 for officers to eat at the deli no matter what they ordered,\" the lawsuit says. \n \n The officers dropped Fedden off at his home, where three cars were parked outside, the suit says. Fedden went inside, urinated, then got in his mother's car and left, the suit says. He crashed minutes later, just after midnight, the suit says. \n \n \"The Suffolk County police at scene #1 conspired to avoid charging Peter with any crimes due to their knowledge of Peter and his generosity to them through his deli, which they frequented,\" the lawsuit says. \n \n \"The defendants carelessly disregarded Peter's safety . . . and actually created the events leading to Peter's wrongful death,\" the suit says. \n \n The lawsuit seeks $130 million in damages.

    "document": "Ken Mehlman is gay. Lots of people thought so, but nobody knew for sure until Mehlman began telling friends and family in recent months. Now it's public: Mehlman has given a full interview to the Atlantic's Marc Ambinder. \n \n This is a big deal. Mehlman managed President Bush's re-election campaign in 2004 and chaired the Republican National Committee from 2005 to 2007. Many influential Republicans have worked with him and respect him. He makes it harder for them to think of homosexuality as a behavior. They now know somebody who is gay. Or, as Donald Rumsfeld might have put it, they now know that they know somebody who is gay. \n \n That's important, because if you look at polls over the last 30 or 40 years, two factors have been driving public opinion in the direction of gay rights. One is whether you know someone who's openly gay. More and more people do, and those who do are more tolerant of homosexuality. The other factor is whether you think it's involuntary. This belief, too, has increased over time, and tolerance has increased with it. It's pretty hard to imagine that the guy who ran the GOP during its recent campaigns against gay marriage would come out as homosexual unless he felt he had no choice. This is simply who he is. \n \n Look at the early reactions from his colleagues. The party's current chairman, Michael Steele, says, \"I am happy for Ken. His announcement, often a very difficult decision which is only compounded when done on the public stage, reaffirms for me why we are friends and why I respect him personally and professionally.\" Very difficult decision means, among other things, that Mehlman had no choice. And because the friendship remains, Steele now has another gay friend to think about when he hears a pitch to score political points at the expense of gays. \n \n Ed Gillespie, the RNC chairman who preceded Mehlman, tells Ambinder that \"it is significant that a former chairman of the Republican National Committee is openly gay and that he is supportive of gay marriage.\" Gillespie acknowledges \"big generational differences in perception when it comes to gay marriage and gay rights as an agenda, and I think that is true on the Republican side.\" Discomfort with abortion isn't going away, but discomfort with same-sex marriage is fading. Homosexuality is becoming normalized. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n In fact, it's becoming Republicanized. Lately, Mehlman has been advising the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which is leading the legal battle for gay marriage in California. The foundation's message is nonjudgmental liberal boilerplate: \"dedicated to protecting and advancing equal rights for every American.\" But Mehlman's personal message goes beyond equality. Ambinder, describing his conversation with Mehlman, reports: \n \n He said that he plans to be an advocate for gay rights within the GOP, that he remains proud to be a Republican, and that his political identity is not defined by any one issue. \"What I will try to do is to persuade people, when I have conversations with them, that it is consistent with our party's philosophy, whether it's the principle of individual freedom, or limited government, or encouraging adults who love each other and who want to make a lifelong commitment to each other to get married.\" \n \n That message isn't just egalitarian or libertarian. It's socially conservative. It embraces marriage as an institution that promotes and solidifies commitment. Andrew Sullivan, Jonathan Rauch, and other writers have made this point for a long time: If you believe in the cultural virtues of marriage, you should support it for gay couples as well as straight ones. \n \n If Mehlman can carry that message into the heart of the GOP\u2014if he can give Republicans a way to be pro-marriage without being antigay\u2014he'll have done a great service not just to his party, but to his community. \n \n \n \n Like Slate on Facebook.

He is, after all, the most powerful Republican ever to identify himself as gay. But my sense is that it\u2019ll be a lot less of a big deal to conservatives than it might be to liberals like (just to choose one name at random) Frank Rich, for whom the political is also the personal. While it\u2019s something that runs counter to the stereotype, most of the conservatives I know are largely to completely indifferent to a person\u2019s sexual orientation. They are the kind of people who might even invite Elton John to perform at their weddings and not give a second thought to the fact that John is gay. \n \n For my part, I knew Ken in the Bush White House and after that, when he was the campaign manager of the re-election campaign and RNC chairman. I\u2019ve always liked him and found his counsel to be wise. He\u2019s a person with very impressive political gifts and talents. Yet by his own account, the personal road he\u2019s traveled has not been an easy one; rather than activists and commentators directing wrath and ridicule at him, I hope some measure of grace and understanding are accorded to him. I realize these qualities aren\u2019t in oversupply in politics, but they should be more common than they are. \n \n It\u2019s fair to say, I think, that all sides in the same-sex marriage debate need to strive for greater respect and civility, for grounding this discussion in reason and empirical facts, in what advances self-government and the common good. And regardless of whether or not one agrees with Ken\u2019s position, he will add to, rather than subtract from, the substance of the discussion. That is more than can be said for the haters. ||||| Former RNC chief Ken Mehlman: I\u2019m gay \n \n posted at 6:37 pm on August 25, 2010 by Allahpundit \n \n He says he realized it \u201cfairly recently,\u201d in Marc Ambinder\u2019s words, which has Tammy Bruce chuckling on Twitter. Honestly, I thought the guy came out years ago. Remember when Bill Maher talked about the rumors surrounding him on Larry King\u2019s show \u2014 back in 2006? I guess you were the last to know, Ken. \n \n He\u2019s doing this now, it seems, because he wants to drum up publicity for the cause of gay marriage and figures that \u201cRepublican whom everyone thought was gay actually is gay\u201d headlines will do the trick. Could be, although Ambinder\u2019s careful to remind readers of the sort of social con initiatives that the GOP pushed during Mehlman\u2019s RNC tenure. That won\u2019t endear him to gay activists, and his newly public identity won\u2019t endear him to social cons. Maybe he should have just worked for gay marriage like Ted Olson and kept his orientation private? \n \n Privately, in off-the-record conversations with this reporter over the years, Mehlman voiced support for civil unions and told of how, in private discussions with senior Republican officials, he beat back efforts to attack same-sex marriage. He insisted, too, that President Bush \u201cwas no homophobe.\u201d He often wondered why gay voters never formed common cause with Republican opponents of Islamic jihad, which he called \u201cthe greatest anti-gay force in the world right now.\u201d Mehlman\u2019s leadership positions in the GOP came at a time when the party was stepping up its anti-gay activities \u2014 such as the distribution in West Virginia in 2006 of literature linking homosexuality to atheism, or the less-than-subtle, coded language in the party\u2019s platform (\u201cAttempts to redefine marriage in a single state or city could have serious consequences throughout the country\u2026\u201d). Mehlman said at the time that he could not, as an individual Republican, go against the party consensus. He was aware that Karl Rove, President Bush\u2019s chief strategic adviser, had been working with Republicans to make sure that anti-gay initiatives and referenda would appear on November ballots in 2004 and 2006 to help Republicans. Mehlman acknowledges that if he had publicly declared his sexuality sooner, he might have played a role in keeping the party from pushing an anti-gay agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate question and one I understand,\u201d Mehlman said. \u201cI can\u2019t change the fact that I wasn\u2019t in this place personally when I was in politics, and I genuinely regret that. It was very hard, personally.\u201d He asks of those who doubt his sincerity: \u201cIf they can\u2019t offer support, at least offer understanding.\u201d \n \n I couldn\u2019t care less either way, but with all the buzz lately about new conservative support for gays \u2014 here\u2019s the latest surreal episode in the Coulter/Farah HomoCon saga, incidentally \u2014 this is a bracing reminder that an openly gay RNC chief probably would still be a problem. Or would it? \n \n Related Posts: ||||| Rumors about former RNC chair Ken Mehlman\u2019s Complete Gayness have been swirling around for years and years. Mike Rogers outed him several years back, as part of his campaign to rid the political world of homosexuals who cynically use the rest of the gay community as bait in order to convince rubes, yahoos, bumpkins and other morons to set down the teevee clicker even if it means missing the last five minutes of The 700 Club, in order to go out and vote Republican, due to abject fear of gays. Mehlman\u2019s sins were particularly egregious, since we are after all talking about the guy who helped run the most anti-gay presidential campaign in history, which gave us Four More Years of the Crawford hick and his handlers, Karl and Dick. \n \n Anyway, now Ken Mehlman has something to say! \u201cAre you there, God? It\u2019s me, Ken Mehlman, and I suck bags of dicks! No, God, I mean literally!\u201d: \n \n Ken Mehlman, President Bush\u2019s campaign manager in 2004 and a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, has told family and associates that he is gay. Mehlman arrived at this conclusion about his identity fairly recently, he said in an interview. He agreed to answer a reporter\u2019s questions, he said, because, now in private life, he wants to become an advocate for gay marriage and anticipated that questions would arise about his participation in a late-September fundraiser for the American Foundation for Equal Rights (AFER), the group that supported the legal challenge to California\u2019s ballot initiative against gay marriage, Proposition 8. \u201cIt\u2019s taken me 43 years to get comfortable with this part of my life,\u201d Mehlman said. \u201cEverybody has their own path to travel, their own journey, and for me, over the past few months, I\u2019ve told my family, friends, former colleagues, and current colleagues, and they\u2019ve been wonderful and supportive. The process has been something that\u2019s made me a happier and better person. It\u2019s something I wish I had done years ago.\u201d \n \n Oh, but if you had done it years ago, Kenneth, you wouldn\u2019t have made eleventy billion dollars by publicly fighting the gay demons in your mind, for Evil, which you then used to buy a swanky $3.7 million man-pad in Chelsea. \n \n Anyway, also, Ken Mehlman is very confused as to why The Gays never signed on to Republican pants-shitting campaigns against Muslins: \n \n He often wondered why gay voters never formed common cause with Republican opponents of Islamic jihad, which he called \u201cthe greatest anti-gay force in the world right now.\u201d \n \n I wonder why! For the answer to this question, let\u2019s go to our slightly more serious homosexual reporter, also named Evan Hurst: \n \n Oh, that\u2019s because the Republican plan for fighting Islamic extremism is laughably stupid, driven by emotion and fear, and exemplifies all the characteristics of Severe Small Penis Syndrome. Additionally, it\u2019s been a hilarious failure everywhere it\u2019s been tried. Thanks, Bill Kristol! \n \n Simple answers to simple questions, this has been. \n \n For his part, Mike Rogers wants to see Ken Mehlman do a LOT of apologizing and public self-flagellation before he will even think about allowing him to be a Socially Accepted Gay: \n \n So, how can Ken Mehlman redeem himself? I want to hear from Ken that he is sorry for being the architect of the 2004 Bush reelection campaign. I want to hear from Ken that he is sorry for his role in developing strategy that resulted in George W. Bush threatening to veto ENDA or any bill containing hate crimes laws. I want to hear from Ken that he is sorry for the pressing of two Federal Marriage Amendments as political tools. I want to hear from Ken that he is sorry for developing the 72-hour strategy, using homophobic churches to become political arms of the GOP before Election Day. And those state marriage amendments. I want to hear him apologize for every one of those, too. \n \n Also, he should probably be punched on live television by Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi, and maybe one of the man-fags from the So You Think You Can Lip Sync While Wearing Wigs or the So You Think You Can Make Pretty Dresses, For Girls, or whatever the hell shows the gays watch obsessively, in groups, while squealing, especially since Mehlman is still giving money to anti-gay candidates! As Joe Jervis said, \u201chookers call that \u2018working both sides of the street.'\u201d \n \n \n \n Classic Liz Glover video of Ken Mehlman at his rooftop goodbye party, June 2007. \n \n For their part, this news is making the homosexual wingnuts show everybody their yucky Quisling boners, which is never appropriate, especially so close to 9/11. \n \n Anyway, welcome to gayness, Ken! Nobody is going to have sex with you, but don\u2019t let it bring you down, because they probably weren\u2019t having sex with you before. [Marc Ambinder/Truth Wins Out/BlogActive]",

    "document": "In the course of one week, the burning of copies of the Koran by U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan has set off a deadly chain of events that has not only inflamed tensions but possibly exposed a crippling weakness in the American strategy to wind down the war. \n \n The emerging U.S. strategy in Afghanistan is built around plans to replace large NATO combat formations with small teams of advisers who will live and work alongside their Afghan partners. \n \n But the killing of two high-ranking NATO officers by an Afghan security official \u2014 and the subsequent decision by the top NATO commander in the country to recall his personnel from top Afghan ministries \u2014 has spurred doubts about whether Afghan security forces can be relied upon to provide for the protection of their Western partners. The consequences of that erosion of confidence, former U.S. officials and analysts say, could be devastating. \n \n \u201cIf the trust, ability and willingness to partner falls apart, you are looking at the endgame here,\u201d said Mark Jacobson, who served until last summer as the NATO deputy senior civilian representative in Kabul. \n \n The killing of the U.S. officers on Saturday occurred two days after a man wearing an Afghan army uniform fatally shot two American troops in eastern Afghanistan, the latest in a string of incidents in recent months in which local security forces have turned against NATO personnel. \n \n Some of the killings have been perpetrated by Afghan troops whose loyalties lay with the Taliban. But, in most cases, the attacks have been the result of tensions between U.S. forces and Afghans who felt as though they had suffered an insult to themselves or their faith. \n \n On Sunday, Afghan President Hamid Karzai, who initially responded to the Koran burnings with outrage, sought to stem the latest wave of violence by issuing a plea for calm and blessing the withdrawal of NATO advisers from his ministries as a justifiable measure. \n \n But protests continued, including in the northern city of Kunduz, where Afghan demonstrators opened fire and tossed a grenade at a U.S. base, wounding seven American troops. The Afghan defense and interior ministers canceled a long-planned trip to Washington to focus on curbing the violence, which has claimed 25 Afghan lives. \n \n \u201cWe remain committed to a partnership with the Afghan government and people,\u201d the U.S. ambassador to Kabul, Ryan C. Crocker, told CNN on Sunday, promising that American service members and civilians would continue to work with their Afghan allies. \n \n For now, though, much of the cooperation between U.S. advisers and their Afghan partners is on hold. And even though the decision to withdraw the advisers is probably temporary, it is not clear how U.S. troops will be able to reestablish trust with Afghan security forces. \n \n \u201cThis is not going back to business as usual,\u201d an Army officer who works as an adviser in Kabul said Sunday. \u201cThe threat is still higher than normal.\u201d \n \n Once advisers return to the ministries, the officer said, some will probably have to shorten their visits, instead of remaining there for six- to 10-hour shifts, to reduce risks. \n \n Senior Obama administration officials have sought to reassure a war-weary American public that the NATO combat mission in Afghanistan would draw to a close by the middle of next year. These officials have implied that the change to an advisory mission would not only mean fewer U.S. service members in Afghanistan, but also less risk for the noncombat troops who remain behind. \n \n Military experts, however, say that the smaller U.S. advisory force might be more exposed to fratricidal attacks than conventional military units. Such attacks \u2014 which were exceptionally rare in Iraq \u2014 often stem from a cultural chasm between U.S. and Afghan troops. \n \n Carter Malkasian, who served as a State Department adviser in southern Afghanistan\u2019s Helmand province in 2010 and 2011, said one way to mitigate that risk is for advisers to build closer relationships with their Afghan partners. But the risk will always be there. \n \n \u201cThe most effective advisers will be with their Afghans all the time, and that certainly does involve additional risk,\u201d Malkasian said. \n \n Unlike a typical infantry platoon, which consists of more than 35 heavily armed soldiers, the advisers work in teams of as few as a dozen troops. Some military and civilian advisers working in Afghanistan said Sunday that the risks associated with their jobs were still manageable and that they believed that they would soon be able to return to their work. \n \n \u201cI hope [the ban] is lifted soon,\u201d said a State Department adviser working at a remote outpost in eastern Afghanistan. \u201cMaybe I am complacent. I know we face all kinds of threats, but we have a job to do.\u201d \n \n Current plans call for the U.S. force in Afghanistan to fall from a peak of 100,000 troops to about 68,000 by the end of the summer. Further reductions are likely later this year and in 2013. All NATO combat troops are expected to be withdrawn by the end of 2014. \n \n In an article in the upcoming issue of Foreign Affairs, Malkasian and Kael Weston, who served a multiyear stint as an adviser in southern Afghanistan, estimated that NATO could hold off the Taliban and keep the Afghan government and security forces functioning with as few as 25,000 advisory troops. \n \n The Afghans would rely on the NATO advisers to call in airstrikes if their position was about to be overrun by a larger Taliban force. The advisers would ensure that their Afghan partner units were receiving ammunition, food and fuel from their headquarters. The Westerners also would help control the most damaging and overt acts of corruption. \n \n To be effective, these troops would have to live without large American bases, expensive dining facilities and intensive quick-reaction forces. \n \n \u201cThe more willing advisers are to accept risk,\u201d Malkasian said, \u201cthe more effective they will be.\u201d \n \n Special correspondent Javed Hamdard in Kabul contributed to this report. ||||| Dow Jones Reprints: This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

So today, Snap begins selling its video-recording sunglasses Spectacles openly online for $129.99 in the U.S. at Spectacles.com. Previously it only dispensed them from Snapbot vending machines in surprise locations and its NYC pop-up store for the last three months. \n \n Snap has now closed that pop-up, and tells me \u201cSnapbots will continue to land in surprising locations around the U.S. following a brief \u201cnap\u201d :) \u201c.

(formerly Snapchat) announced it would be selling camera-enabled sunglasses called Spectacles. The only catch: If you wanted a pair, you had to track down a roving vending machine that popped up in random places around the United States for short periods of time. New York City got a temporary Snap store (it is closed as of today), but long lines and high demand meant you might not be able to get your hands on a pair, even if you waited for hours. (Speaking from experience here.) Starting today, getting your hands on a pair of Spectacles is going to get a whole lot easier; Snap is now selling the glasses via its website. \n \n Spectacles come in three colors \u2014 teal, coral, and the ever-stylish black \u2014 and retail for $130.

Following the vending machine release last fall, plenty of pairs popped up for resale online if you were willing to pay a significant markup. This will likely happen again now that Specs are more widely available.) The purchase limit is six pairs and glasses should ship in two to four weeks. Pop-up vending machines around the country will also remain a part of Snap\u2019s distribution strategy, though they\u2019ll be taking a short break, a Snap spokesperson confirmed. \n \n This announcement comes just weeks after Snap\u2019s SEC filing was released in preparation for its initial public offering.

It will allow users to listen to music from within Facebook.com. Evidence of Facebook's music platform first surfaced in the code of Facebook's video chat service. \n \n According to two sources familiar with the matter, Facebook will not directly host or stream any music or media. Instead, it will rely on partners to provide the content. This is in contrast to Apple, Google and Amazon's strategy of hosting music content on their servers. Facebook's plan is to become a platform for media content in the same way it is a platform for applications and games. \n \n One of our sources specifically mentioned three music services as launch partners: Spotify, Rdio and MOG. It's unclear whether Facebook has lined up other launch partners for its music platform or whether Facebook will open up its platform to other developers. One of our sources noted, however, that Facebook doesn't like playing favorites, so our bet is that Facebook will open up its music platform to other third-party developers. \n \n We've also heard whispers that Facebook intends for this platform to go beyond music \u2014 for example, it's possible that Netflix could stream movies through Facebook. However, we don't know if Facebook will go beyond the music platform announcement at f8. \n \n Update: \"There's nothing new to announce,\" a Facebook spokesperson told us. \"Many of the most popular music services around the world are integrated with Facebook and we're constantly talking to our partners about ways to improve these integrations.\" ||||| The Facebook logo is shown at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California May 26, 2010. \n \n NEW YORK (Reuters) - Facebook is putting finishing touches to new features on users' home pages that deeply integrate music services from partners including Spotify, MOG, Rhapsody, Slacker and Rdio, according to people familiar with the plans. \n \n The music platform is expected to be unveiled at Facebook's developer conference, which kicks off on September 22. \n \n Facebook was not immediately available for comment. \n \n Though Facebook is the world's most popular social networking services with more than 750 million users, its founder Mark Zuckerberg is keen to increase the amount of time users spend in the Facebook environment. \n \n Music is said to be just one aspect of the strategy to improve Facebook's 'stickiness' and it is also expected to partner with other media content owners like movie studios. \n \n \"They are working on a platform for music where the goal is to create a connective tissue for fans,\" said one person familiar with the talks who asked not to be named as the plans are confidential. \n \n Facebook has declined to comment on its new music platform before, but in July several technology blogs reported a software engineer had uncovered programing code for a Facebook product called 'Vibes' for music downloading. \n \n Facebook could give an important boost to its fledgling music streaming partners as they try to compete in a digital music sector dominated by Apple Inc's iTunes's download store. Apple is also readying a streaming service called iTunes Match expected to launch this fall. \n \n The largest music subscription service, Rhapsody, has about 800,000 paying users after nearly 10 years. The next largest in the United States is believed to be Slacker, which claims some 400,000 subscribers, while more recent start-ups like MOG and Rdio are estimated to have significantly less than that. \n \n London-based Spotify, which launched in the United States in July, has more than 1 million paying subscribers and some 10 million users registered to its free access service across Europe. Spotify is believed to have partly benefited from its early integration into Facebook's platform. \n \n The most popular music app on Facebook is currently BandPage, a service from RootMusic that enables artists to market their songs, videos and tour dates. It has over 250,000 artists and 30 million active users monthly. Last month it raised $16 million in Series B funding. \n \n While all the existing music services can already be used on Facebook, the deeper integration will enable Facebook users who are subscribers to a service to share songs and playlists seamlessly with each other and to see what friends are listening to, and more. \n \n The digital music services hope Facebook users will sign up with them after seeing friends sharing playlists that require subscription. \n \n Another senior executive close to the talks said social networking is important to help overcome one of the key challenges for digital music companies: how to help fans discover new music rather than just search for artists and songs they already know. \"Your friends are engaging with you on Facebook, he said. \"It's the new form of radio or TV.\" \n \n Though the prospective business partners have high hopes for Facebook, combining social networking and digital music hasn't always been a guarantee of success. \n \n In 2008, Myspace -- then still a leading social network -- created a music service in partnership with major labels. It had early traction, but not enough to save Myspace's popularity from collapsing. \n \n (Reporting by Yinka Adegoke; Editing by Gary Hill)",

    "document": "Russian hackers who hit the White House infiltrated an unclassified computer system and apparently accessed details about President Obama's schedule. \n \n While the White House previously sought to downplay the seriousness of the hack, which took place last year, the intruders were able to see information about the president that was not publicly available, CNN reported Tuesday. \n \n Officials briefed on the investigation told CNN that the incident was connected to a Russian cyberattack that also breached the State Department's network. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n The breach of Obama\u2019s schedule is notable because the White House maintains tight control over information about the president\u2019s activities.While a general outline of the day\u2019s events is available to the press, Obama takes many meetings and phone calls throughout the day that are not publicly disclosed.The president\u2019s precise whereabouts are also not always known, and the press pool that covers Obama on a daily basis is restricted from accessing many parts of the White House building and grounds.Intimate knowledge of Obama\u2019s activities would be seen as valuable to foreign intelligence agencies like Russia\u2019s.Officials with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Russian hackers were able to break into the White House system through their foothold within networks at the State Department.The intrusion began when hackers sent what is known as a \"phishing\" email from a State Department account, infecting a White House computer with malware, the investigators said.The State Department has been battling its own highly sophisticated cyber intrusion for months, though exactly which portions of its network remain breached is unclear.Private security experts had suspected there was a link between the State Department and White House break-ins.Russia is a key adversary of the United States in cyberspace, and is believed to have infiltrated most U.S. critical infrastructure, including installing malware in software that controls everything from oil and gas pipelines to wind turbines to nuclear power plants.The White House breach made headlines last year as a sign of hackers\u2019 increasing access to the highest levels of the U.S. government.White House officials confirmed in October that its unclassified system had been breached. Computers and systems were not damaged, officials said, though some services were disrupted as cybersecurity experts sought to limit hackers\u2019 activity in the months that followed.The \u201cvast majority\u201d of systems were back online as of late February, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said at the time. \n \n \u2014Last updated at 6 p.m. ||||| Washington (CNN) Russian hackers behind the damaging cyber intrusion of the State Department in recent months used that perch to penetrate sensitive parts of the White House computer system, according to U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. \n \n While the White House has said the breach only affected an unclassified system, that description belies the seriousness of the intrusion. The hackers had access to sensitive information such as real-time non-public details of the president's schedule. While such information is not classified, it is still highly sensitive and prized by foreign intelligence agencies, U.S. officials say. \n \n The White House in October said it noticed suspicious activity in the unclassified network that serves the executive office of the president. The system has been shut down periodically to allow for security upgrades. \n \n The FBI, Secret Service and U.S. intelligence agencies are all involved in investigating the breach, which they consider among the most sophisticated attacks ever launched against U.S. government systems. \u200bThe intrusion was routed through computers around the world, as hackers often do to hide their tracks, but investigators found tell-tale codes and other markers that they believe point to hackers working for the Russian government. \n \n National Security Council spokesman Mark Stroh didn't confirm the Russian hack, but he did say that \"any such activity is something we take very seriously.\" \n \n \"In this case, as we made clear at the time, we took immediate measures to evaluate and mitigate the activity,\" he said. \"As has been our position, we are not going to comment on [this] article's attribution to specific actors.\" \n \n Neither the U.S. State Department nor the Russian Embassy immediately responded to a request for comment. \n \n Ben Rhodes, President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser, said the White House's use of a separate system for classified information protected sensitive national security-related items from being obtained by hackers. \n \n \"We do not believe that our classified systems were compromised,\" Rhodes told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday. \n \n \"We're constantly updating our security measures on our unclassified system, but we're frankly told to act as if we need not put information that's sensitive on that system,\" he said. \"In other words, if you're going to do something classified, you have to do it on one email system, one phone system. Frankly, you have to act as if information could be compromised if it's not on the classified system.\" \n \n To get to the White House, the hackers first broke into the State Department, investigators believe. \n \n The State Department computer system has been bedeviled by signs that despite efforts to lock them out, the Russian hackers have been able to reenter the system. One official says the Russian hackers have \"owned\" the State Department system for months and it is not clear the hackers have been fully eradicated from the system. \n \n As in many hacks, investigators believe the White House intrusion began with a phishing email that was launched using a State Department email account that the hackers had taken over, according to the U.S. officials. \n \n Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, in a speech at an FBI cyberconference in January, warned government officials and private businesses to teach employees what \"spear phishing\" looks like. \n \n \"So many times, the Chinese and others get access to our systems just by pretending to be someone else and then asking for access, and someone gives it to them,\" Clapper said. \n \n The ferocity of the Russian intrusions in recent months caught U.S. officials by surprise, leading to a reassessment of the cybersecurity threat as the U.S. and Russia increasingly confront each other over issues ranging from the Russian aggression in Ukraine to the U.S. military operations in Syria. \n \n Sen. Susan Collins said the revelations of the Russian hack \"are troubling and further expose that our nation's defenses against cyber-attacks are dangerously inadequate.\" The Republican senator from Maine said the breach showed the need to pass legislation to encourage the government and private companies to bolster their cyber defenses. \n \n The attacks on the State and White House systems is one reason why Clapper told a Senate hearing in February that the \"Russian cyberthreat is more severe than we have previously assessed.\" \n \n The revelations about the State Department hacks also come amid controversy over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server to conduct government business during her time in office. Critics say her private server likely was even less safe than the State system. The Russian breach is believed to have come after Clinton departed State. \n \n But hackers have long made Clinton and her associates targets. \n \n The website The Smoking Gun first reported in 2013 that a hacker known as Guccifer had broken into the AOL email of Sidney Blumenthal, a friend and advisor to the Clintons, and published emails Blumenthal sent to Hillary Clinton's private account. The emails included sensitive memos on foreign policy issues and were the first public revelation of the existence of Hillary Clinton's private email address\u200b now at the center of controversy: hdr22@clintonemail.com. The address is no longer in use. ||||| A new report says Russia was behind a hack of a White House computer network last year that exposed sensitive information about President Obama. Now, federal agencies are investigating the breach, reports CBS News correspondent Bill Plante. \n \n The White House would not say who they think is responsible, but sources told CBS News it did come from Russia. The White House has two computer systems: one that handles classified information, the other non-classified information. The unclassified system is the one that was reportedly breached. \n \n \"There's always vulnerability,\" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said at a press conference. \"The fact is that's why we have a classified system because there's less risk in the classified system and that is secure. On the unclassified system we take regular actions to prevent vulnerabilities and to enhance security.\" \n \n Rhodes did not provide specifics about reports that the Russians were behind that hack of the White House's unclassified system last year. That system contains non-public information, including Mr. Obama's sensitive, unpublished schedule. \n \n The reported hack happened during a tense time between the White House and the Kremlin when Mr. Obama and Russian President Putin were at odds over Moscow's involvement in Ukraine. \n \n \"It is a demonstration that the Russians are willing to up the ante in the cyber games against the United States and they're willing to demonstrate their capabilities against the White House itself, the center of American power,\" CBS News senior national security analyst Juan Zarate. \n \n Last October, officials confirmed suspicious cyber activity was detected on the White House computer network around the same time the State Department system was compromised. According to reports, that's how the hackers slipped into the White House system. \n \n \"The reality is that Russia, China and other competitive nation states have at their command, impressive and potentially detrimental cyber tools and they are willing to use them,\" Zarate said. \n \n In February, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told a Senate committee that the Russian cyber threat is more severe than previously assessed. ||||| Russian hackers penetrated the White House non-public, non-classified computer system for several months last year, forcing the White House to shut down the system for several days, U.S. officials said. \n \n The hacked system is not used for classified information, but is used by the White House advance and press office, the general counsel\u2019s office, and officials in the budget and legislative liaison offices. \n \n One person briefed on the hacking said the Russian invaders were difficult to detect and difficult to remove from the White House computer network, and some believe the hackers could still be hiding inside the system tonight. \n \n Ben Rhodes, Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, declined to confirm the breach to CNN, which first reported it today. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to the fact that there was an event last year,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cThere\u2019s always vulnerability and the fact is, that\u2019s why we have a classified system, because there\u2019s less risk on the classified system that is secure.\u201d \n \n The White House National Security Council released a statement saying it disclosed the malicious activity last year and said, \u201cany such activity is something we take very seriously.\u201d \n \n The White House hack comes after the State Department struggled for months to evict hackers from its own non-classified systems, also suspected to be the work of Russian hackers. That hack prompted the State Department to shut down its unclassified email system in March. \n \n US officials briefly referred to the White House cyberattack when they said last fall it was \"connected\" to the State Department hack.",

The Hill points out that although the press has access to \"a general outline\" of Obama's daily routine, there are still phone calls and meetings that aren't made public, and that foreign spies would apparently love to know about. Obama's exact location at any given point during the day is also often kept on the down-low, and certain parts of the White House are off-limits to the press, the Hill adds. Besides the White House scheduling and press offices, others who use the hacked system include the general counsel's office and the budget and legislative liaison offices, ABC News reports.

    "document": "Washington (CNN) Besieged by bad news at home, President Donald Trump is about to get religion, bigly. \n \n In his first foreign trip as President, which begins Friday, Trump has planned a pilgrimage of sorts, visiting the homelands of all three Abrahamic faiths -- Judaism, Christianity and Islam -- before heading to Europe for meetings with Pope Francis and NATO leaders. \n \n In all, it's an ambitious nine-day, five-country tour that will test the religious acumen and diplomatic skills of a President who, beyond courting conservative Christians and casting suspicion on Muslims, rarely talks about religion. \n \n Trump's itinerary includes Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, where he aims to erase his Islamophobic image and urge Muslim leaders to address extremist ideologies. In the Holy Land, Trump wants to jumpstart the stalled peace negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians, while visiting touchstones like the Western Wall. And in Europe, the President seeks to repair frayed relations with two of the continent's most venerable institutions, the Vatican and NATO. \n \n Gen. H.R. McMaster, Trump's national security adviser, called the President's plans unprecedented. \"No President has ever visited the homelands and holy sites of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslims faiths all on one trip,\" he said at a press briefing last week. \n \n Actually, other Presidents have visited Saudi Arabia and the Holy Land on the same trip. But no President has included the Vatican, Catholicism's holy headquarters, on the itinerary. \n \n The White House says Trump has three main goals: to project American power abroad, build relationships with world leaders and \"broadcast a message of unity\" to Jews, Christians and Muslims. \n \n \"What President Trump is seeking is to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress and prosperity,\" McMaster said. \n \n Religious accord is a smart way for the White House to frame Trump's trip, said Chris Seiple, former president of the Institute for Global Engagement and an expert on faith and foreign policy. \n \n \"Most of the American people are utterly fed up with the Middle East, and this framework is a way to get their attention,\" Seiple said. \n \n But some experts question whether Trump is the right messenger to preach about religious unity. \n \n Trump was raised Christian, but as an adult he has rarely attended worship services, nor had he cultivated relationships with religious leaders before running for president. During the campaign, his remarks on religion were sometimes seen as uninformed and divisive. \n \n He was accused of tweeting an anti-Semitic image and trafficking in anti-Jewish tropes; he said \"Islam hates us\" and pledged to temporarily bar Muslims from the United States; he even feuded with Pope Francis, who said that someone who talks only about building walls instead of bridges isn't Christian. Trump called the Pope's comments \"disgraceful.\" \n \n Concerns about Trump's views on religion have carried over into his administration. \n \n He pleased his conservative Christian base with the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and an executive order promising greater legal latitude to pastors who want to preach about politics. But Jews complained for weeks about his reluctance to condemn dozens of bomb threats at Jewish community centers, and Muslims say his executive order halting immigration from several Muslim-majority nations discriminates against their religion. \n \n \"Up until now, Trump's message on Islam has been very confrontational, a clash-of-civilizations type narrative,\" said Shadi Hamid, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert on political Islam. \"For him to talk about the great faiths unified in a common civilization would be quite different.\" \n \n Posing for photos with the Pope and praying at the site of Jesus' tomb may alter aspects of Trump's image, but the his pilgrimage bears considerable risks, especially for someone with a tendency to improvise in delicate diplomatic situations. \n \n \"If he takes advantage of this trip to bring people together, that would be good,\" said Seiple. \"On the other hand, the whole thing could blow up in our face.\" \n \n With those challenges in mind, here are the key religious events during Trump's trip. \n \n Saudi Arabia \n \n Where: Riyadh \n \n When: May 20-21 \n \n Key religious event: Speech to leaders of 50 Muslim countries \n \n McMaster said Trump plans to deliver an \"inspiring yet direct\" speech to leaders from Muslim countries on Sunday. The topic is the \"need to confront radical ideology\" and the \"President's hope for a peaceful vision of Islam to dominate across the world.\" \n \n \"The speech is intended to unite the broader Muslim world against common enemies of all civilization and to demonstrate our commitment to our Muslim partners.\" \n \n The President is fairly popular among Muslim heads of state, experts say, because of his hardline stance on Iran and reluctance to lecture Middle East dictators on human rights. \n \n But Trump's speech risks alienating or even insulting many Muslims who are weary of Western politicians conflating their faith with terrorism. \n \n Elliott Abrams, who supervised President George W. Bush's Middle East policy, said Trump will have to navigate between \"very dangerous portals.\" \n \n \"If he says nothing about Islamic extremism, then supporters at home will say he bit his tongue; if he says too much about it, he could conceivably offend some of those who are there.\" \n \n Early signs about the speech are not encouraging, experts said, especially after CNN reported that Stephen Miller, a White House aide known for peddling Islamophobic ideas , was drafting Trump's address. Miller also helped craft Trump's first executive order barring immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries. (A second order is being fought in the courts after the first version hit legal roadblocks.) \n \n William McCants, director of the Brookings Institution's Project on US Relations with the Islamic World, offered Trump some advice for the speech. The first tip: cancel it. \n \n \"The President is not known for nuance, which is what a speech like this requires to escape the potential wrath of his multiple audiences,\" McCants said. \n \n McCants and other experts on Islam also warned against projecting Saudi Arabia's strict theocracy as a model for \"moderate Muslims.\" \n \n While the country is the custodian of Islam's \"two holy mosques,\" it has also spread a toxic theology, Salafism, that has inspired extremists like al Qaeda and ISIS. What's more, the country has a horrible human rights record, according to international watchdogs, particularly on religious freedom. \n \n One safe proposal, according to foreign policy experts, is a regional roundtable on religious freedom, looking particularly at the plight of Christians in Muslim-majority countries. The Trump administration has been studying the idea , after meeting with members of the Institute for Global Engagement earlier this month. \n \n Israel/West Bank \n \n Where: Jerusalem and Bethlehem \n \n When: May 22-23 \n \n Key religious events: Speech at Israel Museum, prayer at Western Wall, visit to Church of the Holy Sepulchre \n \n In some ways, Trump is sending a message just by setting foot in Israel, Jewish leaders say. \n \n President Obama, during his first Middle East trip, skipped the Jewish state, a slight that some Israelis were reluctant to forgive, said Robert Danin, a former State Department official and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \n \n In Jerusalem, Trump will lay a wreath at Yad Vashem, a memorial to the Holocaust victims, before delivering a speech \"reaffirming America's unshakable bond\" with Israel at the Israel Museum, the White House says. \n \n Danin said some Israeli leaders appear apprehensive about Trump's speech, mainly because they don't know what he's going to say. \n \n \"That uncertainty is very anxiety-provoking for the Israeli government because they fear that he is going to ask the Israelis to do things that this government may not want to do, may not be in a position to do.\" \n \n Other Jewish leaders say they'll be looking for more than pacifying political rhetoric from Trump. \n \n \"We want to see if the President understands Israel's traumas, its security dilemmas and its unique importance in the region,\" said David Harris, CEO of the American Jewish Committee. \"It's about chemistry and tonality and feelings. We want to know if he feels Israel in the kishkes,\" the Yiddish word for gut. \n \n The Trump administration has already caused a diplomatic stir over the Western Wall, the last remnant of Judaism's Second Temple and its holiest place of prayer. \n \n According to reports, an American diplomat said Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu could not accompany Trump to the holy site because it's not in Israel. Previous administrations have considered east Jerusalem, where the wall sits, to be Israeli-occupied territory, but Trump's position is unclear. Palestinians also claim Jerusalem as their capital. \n \n McMaster dodged questions about Trump's stance on the wall, saying the President aims to send a religious, not political, message. \n \n \"He's going to the Western Wall mainly in connection with the theme: to connect with three of the world's great religions -- and to pay homage at each of these religious sites that he's visiting.\" \n \n Earlier that day, Trump will travel to Bethlehem, where he will encourage Palestinian National Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to come to the negotiating table with Israel, the White House says. \n \n Trump has eased the way for talks to restart, Middle East experts say, by delaying a campaign promise to move the US embassy to disputed Jerusalem, a change that would irk Palestinians and other Arabs. \n \n But Trump will still have to address the embassy question, Abrams said. \"If the President says nothing about it, then he is, in essence, moving away from the campaign promise.\" \n \n One possible compromise: Trump could continue to call Jerusalem \" the eternal capital of the Jewish people,\" while dragging his feet on the embassy move. \n \n Rome \n \n Where: Vatican City \n \n When: May 24 \n \n Key religious moment: Meeting Pope Francis \n \n When Trump visits the Vatican Wednesday, it will be the most highly anticipated meeting between Pope and President in recent memory. But those expecting a donnybrook will likely be disappointed, church experts say. Neither the President nor Pope Francis seem eager to replay their brief spat over Trump's border wall. \n \n Asked about the upcoming meeting, Francis said he's keeping an open mind. \n \n \"I will say what I think, he will say what he thinks, but I never, ever, wanted to make a judgment without hearing the person,\" the Pope said at a recent press conference aboard the papal plane. \n \n Francis also said he will not seek to change Trump's mind on policy disagreements. Instead, he'll try to find avenues of agreement. \n \n \"Look for the doors that are at least a little bit open, enter and talk about common things and go on. Step by step. Peace is handcrafted. It is made every day. Also friendship among people, mutual knowledge, esteem, is handcrafted.\" \n \n Churchwatchers say the Vatican is eager to open lines of communication with the new American President, especially after their rocky start. \n \n \"At this point, there doesn't seem to be much common ground between the new President and the Pope,\" said John Thavis, author of \"The Vatican Diaries\" and a longtime reporter on the Catholic Church, \"and that's probably pretty worrying for the Vatican.\" \n \n McMaster said Trump looks forward to paying his respects to the Pope and discussing religious freedom, as well as cooperation in humanitarian missions and combating religious persecution and human trafficking. \n \n Much of the meeting consists of elaborate protocol: the Swiss Guard will welcome Trump as a head of state, and the Pope and President will exchange gifts. The private meeting between Francis and Trump is expected to last just half an hour, as the Pope is scheduled to speak in St. Peter's Square shortly after the encounter. \n \n Rep. Francis Rooney, US ambassador to the Vatican from 2005-2008, said the real diplomatic decisions often occur when the secretaries of state and other diplomats convene on the sidelines. One such meeting covered 16 countries, Rooney recalled, in which the Catholic Church and United States worked together on political and humanitarian missions. \n \n \"The Holy See doesn't have business to promote or consular activities to direct,\" Rooney said. \"It's all about the big ideas and the power of persuasion.\" \n \n For a President who likes to think big and make splashy deals, this trip offers plenty of opportunities, as well as a few potential pitfalls. ||||| US President Donald Trump will repeat his opposition to settlement growth in the West Bank during his first visit to the region next week \u2013 and expects the Israeli government to acknowledge that his position has been heard, a senior White House official said on Thursday. \n \n \n \n The president will visit Jerusalem and Bethlehem during his visit on Monday and Tuesday, meeting with both Israeli and Palestinian leaders, after attending an \u201cArab Islamic summit\u201d in Riyadh over the weekend. \n \n \n \n \n \n He will not arrive in Jerusalem \u2013 or Riyadh \u2013 proposing diplomatic frameworks or road maps of any kind for Israeli-Arab peace, the official said.\u201cThis is not a trip in which the president comes and says, \u2018Here\u2019s my peace plan,\u2019\u201d the official said. \u201cWe\u2019re not looking at something formal yet \u2013 perhaps down the road.\u201dAnd while the president hopes to eventually bring Israelis and Palestinians around the same table, the White House believes it is \u201ctoo early\u201d for those talks to begin on this trip, the official said, confirming earlier reporting in The Jerusalem Post that a trilateral summit among US, Israeli and Palestinian leaders had been put on hold.Aides say the president has no plans ever to serve as an \u201carbiter of details\u201d in future peace negotiations.

While Trump has not expressed that position, Israel had hoped he would have a more tolerant view of settlement construction, which it believes has no bearing on the peace process.Netanyahu on Thursday said he believed that Palestinian refusal to recognize Israel as the nation state of the Jews was the stumbling block to the peace process.\u201cThe failure to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians and achieve peace lies with the Palestinian refusal to accept the existence of the Jewish State in any borders,\u201d Netanyahu told Costa Rican Foreign Minister Manuel A.

Administration officials have not stated whether the president believes the wall is in sovereign Israeli territory, and one official on Thursday confirmed that Trump will be accompanied only by the rabbi of the Western Wall \u2013 not by any Israeli government officials \u2013 \u201cin keeping with the religious nature of the site.\u201dThe official could not confirm or deny reports that Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and an Orthodox Jew, will join the president on his trip to the wall.In Israel, the US Embassy spokeswoman told the Post that \u201cthe Western Wall is in Jerusalem.\u201dShe spoke in reference to comments attributed to US officials working in Jerusalem that the Western Wall was in the West Bank, meaning that it was not under Israeli sovereignty.\u201cThe reports in the press about the conversations are not accurate,\u201d she said. \u201cIn any event, such alleged statements would not have been authorized by the White House, do not reflect the US position and certainly not the president\u2019s position.\u201cAll indications are US officials\u2019 actions were in accordance with longstanding US policy on coordination for such official visits to Jerusalem.\u201dThe sudden dispute that broke out between the US and Israel over the Western Wall was followed by reports that Trump planned to delay the execution of his pre-election pledge to relocate the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.

He will have to abandon his well-known preference for sleeping in his own bed (or in one at the hotels or golf resorts he owns) as he hops between Saudi Arabia, Israel, Belgium, Italy and the Vatican \u2014 all places without a Trump-branded property. \n \n But the trip comes at a critical moment for Mr. Trump\u2019s young presidency. It is his first opportunity to deliver specifics about his \u201cAmerica first\u201d worldview to a global audience that has watched his initial, chaotic months in the White House with a mix of amusement, befuddlement and alarm. ||||| President Donald Trump accompanied by Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, left, calls on a member of the media during a news conference in the East Room of the White House, Thursday, May 18, 2017,...

(Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump's maiden international trip, a five-stop marathon across the Middle East and Europe, has long loomed as a crucial first test abroad for the chaos-courting president. \n \n That was before he fired his FBI director \u2014 and the chain reaction of scandal that followed. \n \n Now, with the eyes of the world upon him, the president will embark on his big trip carrying the baggage of dire troubles at home. As he tries to calm allies worried about his \"America First\" message, he'll be followed by fallout from his firing of FBI Director James Comey and the appointment of a special counsel to probe his campaign's ties with Russia. \n \n \"There has never been a president taking his first international trip being dogged by scandal like this,\" said Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. \"He's already a president viewed skeptically by much of the world. And while the pictures from the trip may be great, the White House can't change the headlines that will follow him wherever he goes.\" \n \n Trump's trip was always going to be dramatic. U.S. allies have been rattled by his warnings about pulling back from the world. He is tasked with urging a united front against terror by appealing to some of the same corners of the Muslim world he has tried to keep out of the United States with his travel ban. Last week, he added new layers of complication by disclosing classified intelligence to a longtime adversary. \n \n Still, the White House once hoped the trip, wrapped in the pomp and circumstance of diplomatic protocol, could offer a chance at a reset after a tumultuous first four months in office. Trump's advisers saw it as an opportunity for the United States to boldly reassert itself on the world stage and resume a leadership role that the administration believes was abdicated by President Barack Obama. Trump's powerful senior adviser, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, led a West Wing team to craft the agenda, laden with religious symbolism. \n \n Still, Trump hasn't been eager to seize the opportunity. It's been more than a half-century since any president waited as long to take his first foreign trip. The itinerary, which begins Saturday in Saudi Arabia, is a startlingly ambitious excursion for a president who dislikes travel and has displayed a shaky grasp of foreign affairs. \n \n Each stop comes with high stakes. \n \n In Saudi Arabia, the president \u2014 whose campaign was marked by heated anti-Muslim rhetoric and whose administration has tried to enact a travel ban from several Muslim-majority countries \u2014 will deliver a speech to the Islamic world meant to be a clear contrast with the vision Obama laid out in his first trip to the region. \n \n In Israel, Trump will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, looking to smooth over fresh tensions. Israel was in an uproar earlier this week after U.S. officials confirmed Trump shared highly classified intelligence about the Islamic State group with senior Russian officials visiting the White House. The information, about an IS threat related to the use of laptops on aircraft, came from Israel and there were concerns a valuable Israeli asset could be in danger, a U.S. official said, requesting anonymity to discuss the sensitive material. \n \n National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster added to the alarm by refusing to declare the Western Wall a part of Israel. U.S. policy holds that ownership of the holiest site where Jews can pray, as with the rest of Jerusalem, is subject to Israeli-Palestinian negotiation. \n \n In Rome, the president will call upon Pope Francis, the popular, liberal-minded pontiff. Trump denounced Francis during the campaign, calling the holiest man in the Catholic faith \"disgraceful\" for questioning his faith. \n \n In Brussels, Trump will attend a meeting of NATO, the World War II-era alliance which Trump has repeatedly mused about abandoning because member states weren't paying their fair share. He recently has shifted to reassure wary allies that he remains committed to the pact. \n \n And in Sicily, the president will meet with the other leaders of the G7, a gathering of Western economic powers. Key parts of the group are unsettled by Trump's unpredictability and his willingness to cheer on nationalist sentiment. \n \n Trump's itinerary is heavy with religious symbolism. He'll visit the birthplace of Islam, the Jewish homeland and the Vatican. Officials say the message is \"unity.\" \n \n \"He strongly believes that it is the strength of the faith of people in these religions that will stand up and ultimately be victorious over these forces of terrorism,\" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. \n \n Administration officials believe the unexpected move of going to Saudi Arabia first was meant to underscore the seriousness of the United States' commitment to fighting extremist groups like the Islamic State. Trump, whose denunciations of Iran have been welcomed by the Saudis, wants to frame the conflict not as one between the West and Islam, but simply between good and evil, according to his aides. \n \n While some Middle East leaders will likely greet Trump warmly, he could receive a far cooler reception in Europe. Though Pope Francis has said he'd \"never make a judgment about a person without hearing him out,\" others on the continent have sharply criticized Trump. That includes France's newly elected President Emmanuel Macron, who denounced Trump's musings on abandoning the Paris climate treaty, a likely point of contention in Sicily. \n \n Trump's inauguration sparked thousands of protesters to fill the streets of several European capitals, chaotic scenes that could be repeated during his stops in Rome, Brussels and Sicily. \n \n \"Welcome to the White House abroad,\" said Ari Fleischer, President George W. Bush's former press secretary. \"This is a great opportunity for the president to change the subject, to make real news. But the downside is that it could be dominated by domestic-style questions. ... Every first trip is over-scrutinized. The whole world is watching.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire \n \n . ||||| \u201cI am very excited for the upcoming trip,\u201d Melania Trump said in a statement. | Getty Melania Trump scheduled to address U.S. military families during trip abroad \n \n Melania Trump will engage with foreign women and children and deliver remarks to U.S. military families and personnel when she joins President Donald Trump on his first trip abroad as commander in chief, the first lady\u2019s office announced Thursday. \n \n The Trumps will leave Washington on Friday for a trip to Saudi Arabia, Israel, Rome, Brussels and Sicily.

Trump may be attempting to rebuild relations with countries like Israel and Saudi Arabia, which frayed under the Presidency of Barack Obama. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will also accompany Trump for most of the trip. \n \n Trump outlined his objectives for this trip, which comes as his Administration struggles with a series of controversies, as he addressed the U.S. Coast Guard Academy on Wednesday. \n \n \u201cI will strengthen old friendships and seek new partners, but partners who also help us, not partners who take, and take, and take,\u201d Trump said in his commencement address. \u201cPartners who help pay for whatever we are doing and all of the good that we doing for them. Which is something that a lot of people have not gotten used to, and they just can\u2019t get used to it.\u201d \n \n Here\u2019s his itinerary: \n \n Saudi Arabia \n \n Trump arrives in Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, on May 20. He will first meet King Salman in Riyadh for coffee, followed by a royal banquet, before holding bilateral talks with the King, the Crown Prince and Deputy Crown Prince. Trump will reportedly come bearing a $100 billion arms deal, and the leaders are likely to discuss issues such as Syria, Iran and the ongoing war in Yemen. \n \n Before having dinner with the Saudi royal family, the President will take part in a signing ceremony on several agreements, which \u201cwill further solidify U.S.-Saudi security and economic cooperation\u201d National Security Adviser H. R. McMaster told the press on May 16. \n \n The next day, Trump will hold bilateral meetings with the Gulf Cooperation Council, which consists of six energy rich Middle Eastern countries. The President will have lunch with leaders from more than 50 Muslim countries\u2014 including Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, who is wanted for alleged war crimes\u2014 during a summit. Syria and Iran were not invited to the event as they are not part of a Saudi Arabian military alliance, that is being established to fight terrorism. There, Trump will give a speech about radical ideology and Islam, which is being drafted by White House aide Stephen Miller, Politico reports. \n \n According to McMaster, Trump will finish-off his trip by inaugurating a new center to fight radicalism and will participate in a Twitter forum with young people. \n \n Israel \n \n Trump arrives in Israel on May 22 amid a handful of diplomatic misunderstandings, which includes Trump allegedly revealing classified intelligence to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that is thought to have come from Israel, and McMaster declining to state that the Western Wall, one of the holiest sites in Judaism, is a part of Israel. \n \n Trump is set to meet with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin in Jerusalem and lay a wreath at the World Holocaust Remembrance Center, Yad Vashem. He will then deliver remarks at the Israel Museum and reaffirm the U.S.\u2019s \u201cunshakable bond with our closest ally in the Middle East\u201d McMaster said. Later that day, he will meet privately with Prime Minister Netanyahu and have dinner with Netanyahu and his wife. \n \n The next day, Trump will spend time with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem, part of his effort to facilitate the end of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In Jerusalem, Trump is set to say a prayer at the Western Wall, becoming the first sitting U.S. President to visit the contested territory. He will also visit the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. \n \n Vatican City \n \n Trump will meet Pope Francis at the Vatican on May 24. Both men hold opposing views on climate change and immigration. Speaking ahead of the visit on May 13, the Pontiff says he won\u2019t try to persuade Trump to his views and he will try and find common ground with the President. \n \n \u201cI will tell him what I think, he will tell me what he thinks, but I never wanted to judge someone before I listen to the person first,\u201d the Pope said, ABC News reports. According to reports, Trump is due to nominate Callista Gingrich, the wife of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, for the post of U.S. ambassador to the Vatican. \n \n Trump will also get a tour of St. Peter\u2019s by the Cardinal Secretary of State and will meet Italy\u2019s President Sergio Mattarella before departing Rome. \n \n Belgium \n \n The President will meet Belgium\u2019s King Philippe and Prime Minister Charles Michel, as well as heads of state and government of the country on May 25. He will then head to the E.U. headquarters in Brussels to meet the E.U. and European Council presidents. Trump has previously said that the U.K. was doing the right thing by leaving the E.U. and that other countries would follow. \n \n Trump will then have a working lunch with French President Emmanuel Macron. During the French presidential elections, Trump told Associated Press that he thought far-right leader Marine Le Pen would do well in the vote as she was \u201cstrongest on borders, and she\u2019s the strongest on what\u2019s been going on in France\u201d he told AP. \n \n Trump is then expected to reaffirm his commitment to NATO while unveiling the security bloc\u2019s memorial, in front of a piece of the Berlin Wall and segment of the World Trade Center. Trump will also say that \u201cfor the good of the alliance, all members must share responsibility and share burdens\u201d McMaster said. Secretary of Defense James Mattis will accompany Trump for a NATO meeting and dinner. \n \n Italy \n \n Trump will head to Italy for the final leg of his trip for a May 26-27 G7 meeting on the island of Sicily. The event will be attended by German President Angela Merkel, Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the leaders of Italy and Japan\u2014 who are keen to gain a clear understanding of Trump\u2019s views on a range of issues, which include trade, terrorism and the refugee crisis. \n \n The White House has however said that Trump will only make a decision as to whether he will pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement on his return from Sicily. According to McMaster, Trump will \u201cpress America\u2019s economic agenda and call for greater security cooperation\u201d he said. \n \n At the summit, Trump will attend a concert by the La Scala Philharmonic Orchestra and attend a leaders\u2019 dinner. \n \n Contact us at editors@time.com. ||||| President Donald Trump has canceled a planned visit and speech at the ancient mountain fortress of Masada in Israel after authorities told him that he could not land his helicopter on top of the UNESCO-listed site. \n \n Instead, Trump will now deliver a speech at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. It comes after an Israeli Air Force (IAF) regulation that prevents helicopters landing at the summit of the Masada site, according to Israel\u2019s Channel 2 broadcaster. \n \n Read more: What to know about Masada, the ancient Israeli site where Trump wasn't allowed to land his chopper \n \n Unlike former presidents who have made the trip, such as George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, Trump declined to land the helicopter at a base of the historic site and then take the cable car up, preferring to cancel the visit altogether. \n \n The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment, referring any matters involving Trump\u2019s schedule to the U.S. government. The Israeli Foreign Ministry also declined to comment on Trump\u2019s schedule. \n \n The reason for the regulation is that helicopters on approach create dust, making landing at the desert site 1,300 feet above sea level precarious. On a previous 1997 landing by the IAF in the middle of Masada, the wind created by the helicopter caused damage to the ruins, according to the Jerusalem Post. \n \n Masada, a UNESCO World Heritage site that the cultural agency calls a creation of \u201cmajestic beauty,\u201d is built upon a mountain overlooking the shores of the Dead Sea in southern Israel\u2019s Judean desert, some 60 miles southeast of Jerusalem. It is one of the country\u2019s archaeological wonders. \n \n King Herod is believed to have built the fortress, but its defining story is that its Jewish rebel defenders who\u2014under threat from a Roman siege\u2014killed themselves rather than be captured alive by the invading forces some time between 73 and 74 AD. \n \n News of the president\u2019s cancellation stirred reactions among observers of the American-Israeli relationship and officials inside the country. \u201cWell Masada was too hot, so we found a great spot instead for POTUS,\u201d Eitan Weiss, deputy spokesperson for the Israeli Foreign Ministry tweeted, appearing to mock the reason for the cancellation. \u201c@IsraelMuseum. The Dead Sea Scrolls make an important setting.\u201d \n \n Another Twitter user joked : \u201cTrump is going to move the U.S. embassy to Masada,\u201d referencing the consideration the president is giving to moving Washington\u2019s diplomatic representation from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. \n \n Read more: Trump ISIS leak to Russia threatens Israel-U.S. intelligence sharing \n \n Martin Indyk, former U.S. ambassador to Israel, tweeted that a raft of decisions on the Trump administration in regard to the visit has \u201csoured\u201d Israel\u2019s mood. As well as the Masada cancellation, Trump will only spend 15 minutes at the national Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem, a move likely to offend the Israelis. \n \n Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty \n \n Ahead of the visit, a member of Trump\u2019s diplomatic staff told the Israelis that the Western Wall was in the West Bank and they did not want Netanyahu to accompany Trump on his visit to the site. The declaration sparked Israel\u2019s anger and a call from the government for an explanation from the White House, which subsequently said that this was not Trump\u2019s position. \n \n It will be the first visit by a sitting U.S. president to the Western Wall (Barack Obama only visited the site as a presidential candidate). \n \n Israel considers the site to be the nearest to the holiest landmark in Judaism\u2014the Temple Mount\u2014where Israelis can pray, to be part of Jerusalem and, therefore, Israel. Jews cannot pray at the Temple Mount, which is controled by a Jordanian-Palestinian Islamic Waqf, or trust. \n \n But the wall sits in the old city of East Jerusalem, a territory Israel occupied in the 1967 Six-Day War, and therefore land that much of the international community, including the U.S., does not recognize as Israel\u2019s. \n \n Jim Watson/AFP/Getty",

Trump departs Friday for an ambitious first foreign trip as president that will include Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the Vatican, a NATO meeting in Belgium, and the G7 summit in Sicily. A roundup of coverage: Trump's first stop on the nine-day trip will be Saudi Arabia, where he is expected to address the leaders of 50 Muslim countries, CNN reports. McMaster says Trump's goal is \"to unite peoples of all faiths around a common vision of peace, progress, and prosperity,\" and his speech in Riyadh will focus on the need to \"confront radical ideology\" and allow a \"peaceful vision of Islam\" to dominate. Trump's second stop will be Israel, where his plans include visits to the Western Wall and the West Bank town of Bethlehem. Newsweek reports that the president had to call off a planned speech at the ancient hilltop site of Masada after Israel declined to allow a helicopter landing. A source tell the Jerusalem Post that Trump will not propose a peace plan at this point, though he may state his opposition to Israeli settlement expansion. The president's European stops will include meetings with Pope Francis and dozens of other leaders and heads of state, Time reports in a detailed look at his itinerary. Among them will be new French President Emmanuel Macron, who will meet Trump for a working lunch May 25. Sources tell the New York Times that Trump has complained to friends that he doesn't really want to go on the trip. His critics, fearing the possibility of monumental gaffes, would also like him to stay home. Stephen J. Hadley, George W. Bush's national security adviser, however, says such trips are tightly controlled and Trump will probably be at ease on the world stage. \"Remember, Trump is a nothing if not a showman,\" Hadley says. \u201cHe\u2019s been very public for decades and very conscious about how he comes across in the media.\" Heritage Foundation foreign policy expert James Carofano tells the Washington Post that the trip abroad will be an opportunity for Trump to have a fresh start after his troubles in DC. \"The great thing about a trip, they control the environment, you control the interaction, you control the agenda and you control the press access,\" he says. \"If you fumble on one of these trips, it\u2019s nobody\u2019s fault but your own.\" Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, disagrees. He tells the AP no other president has made a first foreign trip amid so much controversy. \"He's already a president viewed skeptically by much of the world. And while the pictures from the trip may be great, the White House can't change the headlines that will follow him wherever he goes,\" he says. Melania Trump will be accompanying her husband on the trip, and her itinerary includes G7 and NATO spousal programs as well as speaking to American military families in Italy, Politico reports. \"This will not just be an opportunity to support my husband as he works on important matters of national security and foreign relations, it will also be my honor to visit and speak with women and children from different countries,\" she said in a statement Thursday.

    "document": "When asked to pinpoint where Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential effort began running into trouble, many confidants utter a single word: Dallas. \n \n Mike Murphy, Bush\u2019s political alter ego, decided early on to hold regular senior staff meetings at an unusual location: a Hyatt hotel inside a terminal at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The idea was that it was a central and relatively inexpensive gathering place for a team scattered from Los Angeles, where Murphy lives, to Miami, where the would-be candidate resides. \n \n It went fine at first but quickly became an awkward routine. Donors and other Republicans found the setup ungainly for a campaign-in-waiting that was supposed to be based in Florida. \n \n Older Bush hands also grew unhappy with rapid hiring by new advisers, and relationships frayed, according to Bush associates. And as the former Florida governor began to founder on the trail and in the polls, the discussions flared into arguments about how to divvy up money and resources between Bush\u2019s allied super PAC and his official campaign. \n \n \u201cThese things are always tug of wars,\u201d Thomas D. Rath, a Bush family friend in New Hampshire, said of the initial sessions. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like the first day of school, everyone trying to get to the right place and find the right seats.\u201d \n \n In a speech delivered in Berlin during a three country European tour aimed at promoting his foreign policy credentials, probable U.S. presidential candidate Jeb Bush also addressed campaign \u201cshake-ups.\u201d (Reuters) \n \n The airport huddles were just one sign among many of a political operation going off course \u2014 disjointed in message and approach, torn between factions and more haphazard than it appeared on the surface. Bush\u2019s first six months as an all-but-declared candidate have been defined by a series of miscalculations, leaving his standing considerably diminished ahead of his formal entry into the race on Monday. \n \n [Debrief: For Jeb Bush, the challenge is making it about \u2018Jeb,\u2019 not \u2018Bush\u2019] \n \n In interviews this week, dozens of Bush backers and informed Republicans \u2014 most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to comment candidly \u2014 described an overly optimistic, even haughty exploratory operation. Strategic errors were exacerbated by unexpected stumbles by the would-be candidate and internal strife within his team, culminating in a staff shake-up this week. \n \n The original premise of Bush\u2019s candidacy \u2014 that a bold, fast start would scare off potential rivals and help him overcome the burden of his last name \u2014 has proved to be misguided. \n \n His operation\u2019s ability to rake in large checks also fueled inflated expectations. Supporters acknowledged this week that an allied super PAC was likely to fall short \u2014 perhaps substantially \u2014 of predictions that it would bring in $100 million in the first half of the year. \n \n On the stump, Bush has stuck to his pledge not to shift to the right to win the nomination, but his middle-of-the-road positions on immigration and education have come off more as out of step with the base of his party than shrewdly pragmatic. His wonky question-and-answer exchanges with voters sometimes resemble college lectures rather than a disarming appeal for votes. \n \n The troubles have eroded the image Bush has sought to present as the one Republican uniquely ready for the presidential stage. He has slipped in polls from presumed front-runner to one of several candidates jumbled toward the top of an increasingly crowded field. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that the prospect of a big financial advantage is not going to keep people out of the race and that the notion of a new face is stronger than we might have thought,\u201d Vin Weber, an outside Bush adviser, said in an interview. \u201cThat requires modest adjustments in strategy, not wholesale changes.\u201d \n \n [Jeb Bush shakes up team ahead of campaign launch] \n \n After weeks of bad press, \u201cdonors were getting a little edgy,\u201d Weber said. \u201cNo one is ready to jump ship. Nobody has lost heart. But they have watched other candidates rise in the polls.\u201d \n \n Speaking Wednesday in Berlin during an overseas trip, Bush expressed confidence. \u201cIt\u2019s June, for crying out loud, so we\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d he said, adding later: \u201cI\u2019m going to compete everywhere. If I\u2019m a candidate, there\u2019s no fifth-place, you know, kind of mentality in my mind.\u201d \n \n Forced to make up lost ground, Bush, his aides and his super-PAC allies are now preparing plans to attack the records and experience of his GOP competition, especially Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Rand Paul (Ky.) and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. A summer envisioned as a season of slow and warm introductions to voters is poised to be a battle as Bush tries to recapture his place atop the pack. \n \n \u201cThe Bushes have always underestimated the depth of the base\u2019s dissatisfaction with their policies, and they take the criticism personally,\u201d Laura Ingraham, a conservative radio host, said in an interview. \u201cJeb has to try to understand the reasons why conservatives have problems with him instead of crowing about how principled he is.\u201d \n \n Aides bristle at what they consider the media\u2019s relentless focus on Bush\u2019s personal and professional past. They say that out on the campaign trail, in visits to more than a dozen states, he has been doing exactly what he should. \n \n \u201cInteracting with people on the road who deal with real issues . . . that\u2019s what brings true joy to Jeb,\u201d Sally Bradshaw, a longtime consultant, said in a recent e-mail. \n \n Bush started with an aggressive series of steps late last year and early this year \u2014 a kind of \u201cshock and awe\u201d entry that caught fellow contenders by surprise. The moves were designed to send an unambiguous cue to fundraisers and party activists and to re\u00adinforce a natural advantage Bush had with establishment donors. \n \n [Earlier: Awash in cash, Bush asks donors not to give more than $1 million] \n \n At the same time, Bush\u2019s inner circle operated on the theory that there was little that could be gained by trying to speed up the political clock and that most voters in early states would not begin paying attention until later in the year. \n \n Bush revived a 650-member alumni network of aides who worked for him as governor, and he recruited 21 veterans of his father\u2019s and brother\u2019s administrations to advise him on foreign policy. He hired state directors in the first four early states, aides for outreach to evangelical Christians and Hispanics, and a spokeswoman dedicated to fielding questions from the Spanish-language press. \n \n As Bush travels the country, he has fielded more than 900 questions from donors, reporters and voters, according to aides. He has maintained a busy schedule that stretches from the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada \u2014 where conservative Republicans remain skeptical \u2014 to places visited less frequently at this early stage by presidential candidates, including Denver, Seattle and Puerto Rico. \n \n Despite those efforts, some recent surveys put Bush in a five-way tie for the lead. Recent polls touted by his advisers give him a wide lead in New Hampshire, while others taken nationally and in the early states put him behind Rubio and Walker. \n \n [Post-ABC poll: Bush lead evaporates in unsettled GOP race] \n \n Sensing Bush\u2019s vulnerabilities, Ohio Gov. John Kasich this week hired two experienced GOP operatives as he prepares to jump into the contest and make a play for the same donors Bush has already wooed. \n \n \u201cI didn\u2019t think I was going to be back up here again, because frankly I thought Jeb was just going to suck all the air out of the room, and it just hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d Kasich told New Hampshire business leaders last week. \n \n Bush dispatched one possible adversary early when Mitt Romney decided not to run again. His vigorous entrance also bruised the chances of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who is still pondering a bid. They did not regard Rubio as a likely opponent, thinking he would decide against challenging his onetime mentor, but were proved wrong when the young, telegenic Cuban American jumped in the race. \n \n Early on, there were indications that Bush\u2019s ability to command huge amounts of cash for his allied Right to Rise super PAC was emerging as the dominant characteristic of his potential candidacy. His team laid out presidential-style goals for fundraisers, asking them to pull in $50,000, $100,000, $250,000 or $500,000 by April 17. The money was flowing into the super PAC so briskly that his advisers issued an edict \u2014 no contributions of more than $1 million, for now. \n \n \u201cHe was more of a super-PAC candidate than a retail candidate,\u201d said one Republican close to the Bush operation. \u201c. . . When was the last time he\u2019s asked anyone for a vote? It\u2019s been quite a few years.\u201d \n \n Those concerns, simmering under the surface, finally boiled over one week in mid-May with a series of interviews focused on the most obvious issue imaginable for a Bush: the Iraq war. \n \n [On Iraq question, Jeb Bush stumbles and GOP rivals pounce] \n \n Starting with an interview aired on Fox News on Monday, May 11, Bush struggled over four days to answer whether he would have authorized the war begun by his brother given what is known now about faulty intelligence. He first said yes, then said \u201cmaybe,\u201d then refused to answer altogether. \n \n Finally, that Thursday, he attempted to settle the issue at a campaign-style event in Arizona. \u201cHere\u2019s the deal,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019re all supposed to answer hypothetical questions \u2014 knowing what we know now, what would you have done \u2014 I would have not engaged. I would not have gone into Iraq.\u201d \n \n The episode served to crystallize some of the key concerns about Bush \u2014 his reluctance to criticize or distance himself from the unpopular policies of George W. Bush, and his tendency toward prickliness if pushed. \n \n \u201cWe should have had that answer nailed down,\u201d one donor said. \u201cThere were people who were really shaken by that.\u201d \n \n By the time major party donors gathered in Dallas in late May for a meeting of the Republican Governors Association\u2019s executive roundtable, the overwhelming sentiment, according to several participants, was that Jeb Bush was less formidable than many thought he was going to be. Some flatly stated that they did not believe he could win the nomination. \n \n People close to Bush started getting anxious, according to a top party fundraiser with close ties to his advisers \u2014 and things began to deteriorate inside the Bush camp. \n \n David Kochel, an Iowa-based strategist and former Romney aide, had been brought aboard in January as a de facto campaign manager. As the months wore on, Bradshaw and Murphy became jittery about Kochel\u2019s concentration on staffing issues rather than deflecting the shots being thrown Bush\u2019s way. \n \n Meanwhile, Bush was growing chummy with Danny Diaz, a 39-year-old Washington native and onetime plumber, who was spotted several times on the road with Bush while Kochel ground away at headquarters near the Miami airport. \n \n By late May, Kochel\u2019s grip on power had eroded. Bradshaw and Murphy moved with the candidate\u2019s blessing to push Kochel into a lesser role and ensure they alone had final say about the allocation of funds. The candidate, urged on by his allies and donors, suggested that a more assertive tack was necessary. \n \n On Monday, as Bush prepared to leave for Europe, Diaz was named the campaign manager. \n \n Friends and donors are hopeful that Bush has corrected course and that his cash-flush political committees will carry him further than other candidates. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s going to try to do it his way without acting with every change in the wind, without doing full face-plants on the pandering,\u201d said Tallahassee lobbyist John \u201cMac\u201d Stipanovich, a Bush ally. \n \n Dan Balz, Scott Clement, Matea Gold, Tom Hamburger and Philip Rucker in Washington and Karen Tumulty in Berlin contributed to this report. ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n BERLIN \u2014 Jeb Bush said Wednesday that he felt compelled to reorganize his political team \u2014 and pick a new, unexpected campaign manager \u2014 \u201cbased on the skills of people that I got to know\u201d and the \u201cmagnitude of the journey\u201d he faces as a candidate. \n \n In his first remarks about the reshuffling, Mr. Bush, a former governor of Florida, pleaded for patience and played down the idea that he was displeased with his standing in a crowded Republican field. He is expected to formally enter the race next week. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s June, for crying out loud, so we\u2019ve got a long way to go,\u201d he said during a news conference held outside his hotel here on the second and final day of meetings and speeches in the German capital. \u201cI just urge everybody to be a little more patient about this.\u201d \n \n Mr. Bush called Danny Diaz, his new campaign manager, \u201ca grinder.\u201d He added that David Kochel, who had been expected to lead the political operation, was best suited to serve as chief strategist, with a focus on states like Iowa that hold caucuses and primaries in the early part of the campaign. \n \n That \u201cis where his skills sets are,\u201d said Mr. Bush, who called Mr. Kochel \u201ca great strategic mind.\u201d \n \n Pressed on polls that show he is lagging or not strongly leading in a few early states, especially Iowa, Mr. Bush all but dismissed the data. \n \n \u201cPolls are, you know, it\u2019s fun to see them when you\u2019re winning, not so fun when you\u2019re not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter, though.\u201d \n \n Mr. Bush said he would seek to compete in every state, regardless of how he was performing in polls. \n \n \u201cIf I\u2019m a candidate, there\u2019s no fifth place, you know, kind of mentality in my mind,\u201d he said.",

Authorities believed the \"threat of a terrorist attack was very imminent.\" \n \n \u2022 The suspected terror cell, which included people returning from Syria, planned to target police officers, Van der Sypt said.

Rescue efforts were underway as top government officials rushed to the site and public appeals were launched for aid. \n \n The official Lao news agency KPL said the Xepian-Xe Nam Noy hydropower dam in Attapeu province collapsed Monday evening, releasing large amounts of water that swept away houses and made more than 6,600 people homeless. \n \n The dam was constructed by a joint venture led by South Korean companies, with Thai and Lao partners. The project was still under construction, KPL reported. It described the portion that collapsed as a \"saddle dam,\" which is an auxiliary dam used to hold water beyond what is held by the main dam. \n \n Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith \"suspended the planned monthly meeting of the government for August and led his Cabinet members and other senior officials to Sanamxay (district) to monitor rescue and relief efforts being made for flood victims,\" KPL said. Many areas of Laos have recently been hit by floods from heavy seasonal rains. \n \n Provincial authorities issued a call for emergency aid \u2014 clothing, food, drinking water, medicine, cash and other items \u2014 from the \"party, government organizations, business community, officials, police and military forces and people of all strata.\" \n \n Laos, one of the poorest countries in Asia, has transitioned from communism to a market economy but remains a single-party state where freedoms are limited. There is virtually no freedom of the press, and foreign reporters who visit operate under tight restrictions, limiting the flow of information. \n \n Electricity from several hydroelectric dams provides a large share of Laos' export earnings, with Thailand being a major buyer. \n \n KPL said the Xepian-Xe Nam Noy project cost an estimated $1.02 billion. \n \n According to the website of the company that built and runs the dam, it is majority-owned by two South Korean companies, SK Engineering and Construction and Korea Western Power. Most of the financing for the project came from Thai lenders. The Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding Public Co. Ltd of Thailand holds a 25 percent stake and the Lao Holding State Enterprise holds 24 percent. \n \n The dam was built to divert the Houay Makchanh, Xe-Namnoy and Xe-Pian rivers into reservoirs that feed into a 410-megawatt power plant designed to generate 1,879 gigawatts of power a year, with 90 percent of the power being exported to Thailand and the remaining 10 percent used locally. The project is a 27-year concession and was due to begin operating in 2019, a year later than originally planned. \n \n The project is on a volcanic plateau divided by a river gorge and the catchment area accounts for 17 percent of the Mekong river's annual flow. \n \n According to assessment documents, about 30 villages were affected by the project with more than 2,000 people in eight villages resettled. Roughly 10,000 people live in the affected area, with most belonging to ethnic minorities. \n \n The project was supposed to be a cash cow for SK E&C for years. The company is part of the SK Group, one of South Korea's top three conglomerates. Its units include SK Hynix, the world's second-largest chipmaker, and SK Telecom, South Korea's largest telecom carrier. \n \n Thailand was to receive a stable supply of electricity while Laos was supposed to receive taxes, royalties and other income estimated at $33 billion per year. \n \n South Korea's Yonhap News agency said SK E&C has dispatched its president to Laos and has set up an emergency team in Seoul. SK E&C did not respond to several calls seeking comment. \n \n Yonhap said SK E&C was still trying to find out whether water had overflowed the dam or if the dam had collapsed. \n \n Yonhap quoted an unidentified SK E&C official as saying rain in the area was three times more than the usual amount, and that one of five auxiliary dams had overflowed. \n \n It said SK E&C is focusing on the rescue operation, using boats and other equipment to search for missing people. \n \n ___ \n \n Lee reported from Seoul, South Korea.

He said the firm was co-operating with the government to rescue villagers. \n \n \"We do not have any formal information yet about any casualties or how many are missing,\" an Attapeu official told the AFP news agency on condition of anonymity, adding that there was no phone signal in the region. \n \n \"We sent rescue teams who will help them and provide basic assistance first,\" the official added. \n \n Image: Villagers carry their belongings as they evacuate in the wake of the collapse \n \n The Red Cross has staff and volunteers on the ground helping with the response to the disaster, with the organisation saying it has \"caught everyone unawares\". \n \n The $1.2bn (\u00a3915m) dam is part of a project by Xe-Pian-Xe Namnoy Power Company, a joint venture which is also known as PNPC. \n \n A number of companies are involved, including Thailand's Ratchaburi Electricity Generating Holding, South Korea's Korea Western Power and the state-run Lao Holding State Enterprise. \n \n South Korea said 53 of its nationals were taking part in the construction and were evacuated in advance of the collapse. \n \n The 410 megawatt capacity dam, close to the border with Cambodia, was meant to begin commercial operations by 2019. \n \n Image: A computer-generated image of a dam being built in Laos by Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy Power Company \n \n It was to form part of a series of dams over the Houay Makchanh, the Xe-Namnoy and the Xe-Pian rivers in neighbouring Champasack province. \n \n The plan was to export 90% of the electricity generated to Thailand, with the rest offered up on the local grid. \n \n Environmental groups have long voiced fears about hydropower ambitions in impoverished and landlocked Laos, with around 10 dams in operation, another 10 to 20 under construction and dozens more in the planning stages. \n \n In particular, concerns have been raised about the impact on the Mekong River, its flora and fauna and the communities that depend on it for their livelihoods. \n \n As well as disquiet within Laos, several neighbouring nations are worried its ambition to become the \"battery of southeast Asia\" will disrupt vital ecosystems and their own river systems.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Hundreds of people are missing, more than 6,000 have been left homeless, and an unknown number are thought dead after a portion of a still-under-construction hydroelectric dam in Laos' Attapeu province reportedly collapsed Monday night, per the AP. The country's KPL news agency, via the BBC, reports that the collapse of an auxiliary dam attached to the main Xepian-Xe Nam Noy hydropower dam led to flash floods in the southeastern Laos province, sending locals to the roofs of their houses and boats out to rescue survivors. The New York Times notes that 175 billion cubic feet of water gushed out and flooded the area; Sky News notes that's about the amount that would fill 2 million Olympic-size swimming pools. The dam, which was on schedule to open in 2019, is a joint project run by two South Korean companies, including SK Engineering and Construction, as well as Thai and Lao lenders. An SK E&C official quoted by the Yonhap news agency says a deluge of rain that's about three times more than usual had flooded the auxiliary dam. Yonhap says officials are still trying to figure out if the dam overflowed or simply gave way. The dam in Laos, one of Asia's most poverty-stricken nations, was set to bring in billions of dollars for the country by helping to generate electricity that would mostly be exported to Thailand.",

    "document": "The 2019 Golden Globes nominations are out. Let\u2019s first hit some surprises, because there were some rather huge ones on the TV side. \n \n NBC\u2019s fan favorite The Good Place was finally honored for best comedy series. Sacha Baron Cohen unexpectedly crashed the best actor in a comedy category for Showtime\u2019s political prank series Who Is America? The excellent imported BBC/Netflix thriller Bodyguard got a best drama series nod. And Candice Bergen was nominated for CBS\u2019 low-rated (and presumed canceled) Murphy Brown reboot. With the exception of The Good Place honor, top oddsmakers did not see any of those coming. \n \n We\u2019ll have more of surprises along the way. But here are the biggest snubs in the TV categories. \n \n The Handmaids Tale (Hulu).The dystopian drama swept the Emmys for its debut season in 2017 and won for best drama series at the Globes last year. Yet season 2 failed to get a nomination in the top category, and it was a title on every prediction list (stars Elisabeth Moss and Yvonne Strahovski were both nominated, as expected). This is a pretty shocking omission, though the latest season was admittedly more divisive among critics and fans than the first. \n \n Westworld (HBO). Another big drama series snub. The second season cleaned up at the Emmys a few months ago, with four wins, but aside from a supporting nod for Thandi Newton, the Hollywood Foreign Press was apparently less impressed. Actors Ed Harris, Jeffrey Wright and Evan Rachel Wood were all left out. Also absent from the drama category: The second season of Ozark (Netflix) was snubbed, though star Jason Bateman was nominated. \n \n Atlanta (FX): The second season of the innovative rap-scene comedy, despite being an Emmy favorite, was surprisingly shut out of the top comedy slots (though star Donald Glover was nominated). Also snubbed was another Emmy darling, Netflix\u2019s \u201980s wrestling dramedy GLOW (yet actress Alison Brie got a nod). There was an upside: The Good Place (NBC) finally broke into this category with its first Globes comedy series nomination, and star Kristen Bell was nominated for lead actress in a comedy too. \n \n Sterling K. Brown, John Krasinski, Liev Schreiber, Milo Ventimiglia and Bob Odenkirk. The best actor in a drama category featured some serious upsets. Last year\u2019s winner, Brown, was fully expected to at least get a nomination once again for This Is Us. Three-time nominee Odenkirk was fully expected to get recognized for Better Call Saul. Krasinski was fully expected to get nominated for his work in Amazon\u2019s Jack Ryan. Five-time nominee Schreiber was fully expected to get nominated once again (due to the HFPA\u2019s curious love for Showtime\u2019s Ray Donovan). And Ventimiglia, well, he wasn\u2019t fully expected to get a This Is Us nod, but some thought he might squeeze in. Instead, there were new additions like Stephan James for Amazon\u2019s Homecoming and Billy Porter for FX\u2019s Pose. \n \n Jodie Comer. The Killing Eve actress was expected to get a nomination for lead actress in a drama series along with her co-star Sandra Oh (who was nominated), yet was shut out. Robin Wright was also snubbed for the final season of Netflix\u2019s House of Cards. Instead, there was a minor surprise on the list: Outlander\u2019s Caitriona Balfe, who was nominated last year, but wasn\u2019t necessarily expected to make the list this time given the intense competition from newcomers like Oh and Homecoming\u2018s Julia Roberts. \n \n Ted Danson. While The Good Place received nominations for best comedy series and an actress nod for Kristen Bell, Danson, who was considered the most likely nom of the three, was left out. Blame Sacha Baron Cohen? \n \n Maniac (Netflix): Many thought the psychological dark comedy-drama was brilliant and unlike anything else on TV this year, so it was expected to get a nom in the movie-limited series category. Nope. Star Emma Stone was also left out for Maniac \u2014 the Globes snub which seemed to elicit the most Twitter upset this morning among the TV categories. Stone did receive a supporting nod for her work in the movie The Favourite, however. \n \n Patrick Melrose (Showtime) was also skipped in the series limited series category, despite predictions, though that\u2019s more understandable given the project\u2019s somewhat lackluster reaction \u2014 all the praise was around the boozy performance of star Benedict Cumberbatch (who was of course nominated). Another Showtime snub in the movies-mini category: Benicio Del Toro, who was given strong odds to land a mention for his work in Escape at Dannemora. \n \n Movie nominations snubs and surprises here. \n \n Full list of Golden Globes nominations. ||||| From left, Ethan Hawke stars in First Reformed, KiKi Layne and Stephan James in If Beale Street Could Talk, Sam Elliott in A Star is Born. \n \n Each year, the roughly 90 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association both confirm and upend various awards-season narratives with their Golden Globe nominations. This year was no different. Let\u2019s take a look at some of the biggest snubs and surprises from this morning\u2019s nominations. \n \n Movies \n \n Sam Elliott\u2019s Momentum Slows? \n \n The supporting-actor category looks much as we expected it to this morning, except for one glaring omission: where is Sam Elliott for his rich, tearful work in the otherwise generously nominated A Star Is Born? Elliott has long been thought of\u2014in some circles, anyway\u2014as the supporting-actor front-runner. But just a week after winning the prize from the National Board of Review, Elliott finds himself without a nomination at the pre-prom. No disrespect to the fellow who likely snatched his nod, BlacKkKlansman\u2019s Adam Driver\u2014but this is a pretty big upset for a campaign that had been looking a lot sturdier than many other hopefuls.\u2019 Ah, well; we\u2019ll just chalk it up to the Hollywood Foreign Press being weird, as we do with everything Golden Globes-related every year. \n \n Mary Poppins\u2019s Magic Burns Out \n \n Mary Poppins Returns was richly rewarded Thursday: for Emily Blunt\u2019s and (surprisingly?) Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s lead performances, for best musical or comedy, and for Marc Shaiman\u2019s score. But curiously, especially given that last nomination, the sequel could not secure a spot in the best-original-song category. Perhaps all the film\u2019s songs bled together into one pleasant blur, or maybe it was just up against competition that proved too tough: who do you say no to in that category to make room for Mary? Annie Lennox? Lady Gaga? Dolly Parton?? Maybe Poppins could have taken Boy Erased\u2019s spot, but \u201cRevelation\u201d is a gorgeous song, one that closes out an Important Issue movie. Whatever the reason for the snub, Disney\u2019s London skies are looking a little dimmer this morning. \n \n The Ethan Hawke-aissance May Not Be Televised \n \n He\u2019s won some critics\u2019 awards, yet First Reformed star Ethan Hawke couldn\u2019t land a nomination for best actor in a drama\u2014even though he didn\u2019t even have to compete with Viggo Mortensen or Christian Bale, who are in the comedy/musical category. That may mark a serious impediment to the rest of his awards-season campaign, despite his film being easily one of the best-reviewed of the year. Maybe the movie is too small, too alienating for the H.F.P.A. Or maybe they loved Lucas Hedges in Boy Erased too much. Or maybe if Rami Malek and Bradley Cooper had been run in musical/comedy, where they belong, Hawke would have gotten what\u2019s owed to him. In any case, the First Reformed folks better start praying to keep Hawke in the hunt. \n \n Peter Farrelly and Adam McKay Spoil Everything \n \n Well, they\u2019re not spoiling everything. But the respective directors of Green Book and Vice are taking up spots that could have been occupied by The Favourite\u2019s Yorgos Lanthimos, If Beale Street Could Talk\u2019s Barry Jenkins, or Can You Ever Forgive Me?\u2019s Marielle Heller. Farrelly and McKay, two older comedy guys working more serious than usual, are pretty dull, mainstream choices in a year that offered exciting and different options. Heller\u2019s nomination would have been particularly heartening, given that the Globes have only had a handful of female-director nominees in the last few decades, and Can You Ever Forgive Me?\u2014nominated for two major acting prizes\u2014is one of the strongest titles of the year. But, no. Instead, the H.F.P.A. opted for Farrelly\u2019s incredibly straightforward direction and McKay\u2019s messy collage of a reviled vice president. We\u2019ll forgive them someday, but not today. \n \n _If Beale Street Could Sing \n \n Craft categories don\u2019t frequently lend themselves to surprises\u2014partially because they aren\u2019t as closely watched; partially because the right answers are often predictable\u2014but it was admittedly strange not to see Nicholas Britell, who wrote the lush, jazzy score for If Beale Street Could Talk, missing among the nominees this morning. In addition to having some of the best music, that movie had some of the most music\u2014it seems impossible that voters didn\u2019t notice it. Other great scores that are missing, if not quite snubbed, include Nate Heller\u2019s marvelous work for Can You Ever Forgive Me? and David Lang for Paul Dano\u2019s directorial debut, Wildlife. \n \n Cold War Gets Iced Out \n \n In the foreign-language-film category, it was a slight shock not to see Pawel Pawlikowski\u2019s beloved Cold War in the running. Pawlikowski\u2019s last film, Ida, was a nominee for this award in 2015, eventually going on to win the trophy in this category at the Academy Awards. Cold War is the better movie, but it likely lost its slot to Roma, which, by the H.F.P.A.\u2019s rules, was ineligible to compete in the best-drama category\u2014where it might otherwise have practically been guaranteed a nomination. \n \n Television \n \n Stars Are Blindsided \n \n The Globes are typically the awards most likely to present a nomination to anyone who sounds famous doing something on TV\u2014or are they? Because in a strange new trend, stars Al Pacino and Kevin Costner weren\u2019t nominated for their roles slumming it on the boob tube\u2014even though Costner\u2019s Yellowstone has been a ratings success on the newly rebranded Paramount Network. EGOT king John Legend also failed to sway the H.F.P.A. for his much-lauded turn as Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar Live, and even Robin Wright\u2019s complex tightrope act behind the scenes of a House of Cards in upheaval didn't impress Globes voters. \n \n An Actor Shake-Up \n \n Julia Roberts, for her part, earned a nomination for Homecoming. But so did her 24-year-old breakout co-star, Stephan James\u2014beating out Costner to enter a bizarre, but fascinating category for best actor in a drama series. Edging out worthies like Bob Odenkirk, Sterling K. Brown, Jeffrey Wright, and Globes perennial favorite Liev Schreiber are James, Jason Bateman, Emmy winner Matthew Rhys, and two more big surprises: Billy Porter from FX's queer ballroom drama Pose, and Richard Madden from Netflix's word-of-mouth hit Bodyguard. \n \n The H.F.P.A. Doesn\u2019t Like Shows That Age \n \n Several veteran series in contention at the Emmys\u2014and on critics\u2019 best-of lists\u2014failed to draw the H.F.P.A.\u2019s attention. Atlanta, which won outstanding comedy series in 2017, wasn't even nominated in the category for its second season. Neither were the later seasons of This Is Us, Westworld, and The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, reflecting the Globes\u2019 interest in what\u2019s up and coming. \n \n Broadcast Isn\u2019t Dead \n \n Apparently, the H.F.P.A. also has a thing for network comedies. In the category for best actress in a comedy, three out of the five actresses nominated come from sitcoms\u2014Debra Messing, Candice Bergen, and Kristen Bell.

Here are some of the most notable Globes snubs for 2019. USA TODAY \n \n Ryan Gosling missed out on an acting nomination for \"First Man,' which wasn't nominated for best drama. (Photo: Daniel McFadden/Universal Studios) \n \n The Hollywood Foreign Press Association showered awards praise on \"Vice,\" which received six Golden Globe nominations on Thursday. But it was a bad morning for everyone named Ryan (Gosling, Coogler and Reynolds) at the 76th annual awards show, which reveals its winners on Jan. 6 (NBC, 8 p.m. EST/5 PST). \n \n These were the most notable snubs: \n \n Ryan Gosling, Ryan Coogler and Ryan Reynolds. It was a tough year for everyone's favorite Ryan. Gosling lost out on a nomination as astronaut Neil Armstrong in \"First Man\" (also overlooked for best drama). Coogler was passed over as director of \"Black Panther\" (nominated for best drama). And Reynolds, who earned nominations for best actor and best movie for 2016's \"Deadpool,\" was overlooked for \"Deadpool 2.\" \n \n \"This Is Us.\" The NBC drama was completely shut out, including from the best-drama category. Previous acting nominees Mandy Moore, Chrissy Metz and Sterling K. Brown (who made history last year as the first African-American to win best actor in a TV drama series) all went missing. \n \n Chadwick Boseman and Michael B. Jordan. \"Black Panther\" cruised into a best-drama nomination without lead actor Boseman, T'Challa himself, earning a best-actor spot. Jordan, as villainous Erik Killmonger, was also denied a nomination for best supporting actor. \n \n More: Who got nominated for Golden Globes? Here's the list \n \n Clint Eastwood. The 88-year-old film legend's latest drama, \"The Mule\" \u2013 his first lead role since 2012's \"Trouble With the Curve\" \u2013 was stubbornly denied in all categories, including best actor. \n \n \"The Grinch.\" The animated film version of the Dr. Seuss classic, with Benedict Cumberbatch voicing the Christmas-hating creep, has been a moviegoing favorite this holiday season. But it missed out on an animated-movie nomination. \n \n \"The Grinch\" was denied an animated movie nomination by the Golden Globes. (Photo: Universal Pictures) \n \n \"Atlanta.\" The FX series, created and starring Donald Glover, took best comedy at the Golden Globes last year, but it failed to earn that nomination in 2018. Glover was nominated for best actor in a comedy, an award he won last year. \n \n More: Dick Cheney biopic \u2018Vice\u2019 leads Golden Globes field with six nominations \n \n Also: Sandra Oh, Andy Samberg to co-host 2019 Golden Globes \n \n \"A Quiet Place.\" Director and star John Krasinski's box-office hit ($330 million worldwide), his first starring collaboration with wife Emily Blunt, has received rare critical raves for a horror film (an impressive 95% positive critical rating on Rotten Tomatoes), the kind that often warrant awards recognition. The film was nominated for movie of the year at the People's Choice Awards, but it scratched out only a nomination for best original score for the Globes. \n \n Meryl Streep gives a little heartbreak in \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again.\" (Photo: UNIVERSAL) \n \n \"Widows.\" With an all-star cast (including Viola Davis and Liam Neeson), Oscar-winning director Steve McQueen's heist drama seems poised for awards glory. But it received nothing at the Golden Globes, not even a best-actress nomination for Davis. \n \n The songs of \"Mary Poppins Returns.\" Blunt (as Mary Poppins) and Lin-Manuel Miranda scored in the major acting categories, and the movie was nominated for best comedy or musical. Though Marc Shaiman's score earned a nomination, none of the songs in the musical, including \"The Place Where Lost Things Go,\" were recognized. \n \n \u201cMamma Mia! Here We Go Again.\u201d With both \"A Star As Born\" and Queen biopic \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" moved to the drama section, there was room for another actual musical to move into the best comedy or musical category. Ten years ago, the original \"Mamma Mia!\" took two nominations, for best comedy or musical, and best actress for Meryl Streep. The sequel was shut out in 2018. \n \n Amandla Stenberg. Stenberg has earned raves for her performance in timely drama \u201cThe Hate U Give\u201d as student Starr Carter, who witnesses the fatal police shooting of her childhood best friend. But the drama was overlooked. \n \n Hugh Jackman. Given that Jackman nabbed a best-actor nomination last year for \"The Greatest Showman,\" it would have seemed that the beloved Aussie could ride into this year's awards with a nomination for his serious political drama \"The Front Runner,\" playing Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart. But he did not. \n \n Meryl Streep. Sure, Streep has a smaller role as Donna in \"Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again!\" than she did in 2008's first film, which earned her a best-actress nomination. And Streep has one memorable scene in \"Mary Poppins Returns.\" But this is three-time Oscar winner Meryl Streep, who has won eight Golden Globes. Any time she's overlooked, it's a snub. \n \n Read or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/12/06/golden-globes-biggest-snubs/2221430002/",

Now, it\u2019s a far more even split \u2014 44 percent to 40 percent, with a slight edge for the president \u2014 but the share of those saying they have confidence in \u201cneither\u201d has ticked up into double digits. \n \n The poll contains ample evidence of the disillusionment voters feel toward both sides amid a sense of continuing dysfunction in Washington, which since December has been grappling with fiscal crises and deadlines of its own making. \n \n Almost two weeks into the automatic across-the-board budget cuts known as the sequester, a slim majority of Americans dis\u00adapprove of the reductions. At the same time, nearly three-quarters say they are feeling no impact on their lives, and fewer than half expect a toll on their family finances if the cuts continue. \n \n Still, large majorities expect that the sequester will eventually damage the economy, the military and the government\u2019s ability to provide basic services. Most, 68 percent, say they would like the two sides to work together to come up with a deal to stop the cuts. The desire for cooperation is widely shared across party lines. \n \n View Graphic Obama\u2019s reelection honeymoon ends \n \n Asked who is responsible for the sequester, 47 percent say Republicans in Congress and 33 percent say Obama. \n \n The poll suggests a closer divide on which side the public trusts in the battles over issues such as immigration and gun control \u2014 closer, perhaps, than the public\u2019s policy preferences would indicate. Americans largely support the administration\u2019s stand on new measures to curb gun violence, but on basic trust on the issue, the president and Republicans in Congress fare about evenly. \n \n Obama\u2019s overall job-approval rating stands at 50 percent, down five points from before he took the oath of office in January. Looking along partisan lines, the slippage since then has been particularly pronounced among political independents. Two months ago, independents tilted clearly in his direction, with 54 percent approving and 41 percent disapproving. Now, half of independents express a negative opinion of the president\u2019s performance; just 44 percent approve. \n \n The president has also seen an erosion in confidence among groups that he has counted as core supporters. Compared with a Post-ABC poll in December, the share of liberals who place their faith in Obama over Republicans when it comes to dealing with the economy is 14 points lower; there has been a 12-point slide among women. \n \n At 50 percent, Obama\u2019s overall standing in the poll is lower than that of most other modern second-term presidents at this point in their terms. Of the seven second-term presidents who have been in office since Harry S. Truman, only George W. Bush had a positive rating as low as 50 percent at this stage. \n \n Obama and Bush share another similarity, one that describes what is arguably the most potent force shaping political decision-making in recent years: a deeply divided electorate. Among post-World War II presidents, Bush and Obama are the only ones to have led a nation as politically polarized as it is today. In both cases, there is a gap of more than 70 points between Democratic and Republican assessments of the president. \n \n Congress remains far lower than the president in public esteem, with only 16 percent approving of its performance and 80 percent disapproving. That negative feeling extends to both parties, with congressional Democrats registering a ratio of 34 percent favorable to 62 percent unfavorable sentiment; Republicans are lower still, at 24 to 72. \n \n The poll was conducted March 7 to 10 among a random sample of 1,001 adults. The full survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. \n \n At a moment when the statistics \u2014 a booming stock market and surprising new strength in the job market \u2014 suggest a more vigorous economy, many Americans are not themselves seeing progress. \n \n Barely more than half of those surveyed say the economy has started its recovery. And after a brief foray into neutral territory, most Americans again give Obama negative marks on handling the economy. The personal assessments of the economy\u2019s trajectory relate directly to Obama\u2019s overall rating: Seventy-three percent of those who say they sense economic growth approve of the way the president is doing his job, and an identical 73 percent of those who don\u2019t see a recovering economy disapprove of his performance in office. \n \n As they do on the economy, the president and the Republican opposition have rough parity on the question of who is better positioned on gun control, with Obama the choice of 42 percent and congressional Republicans, 41 percent. \n \n On immigration, Obama has a six-point advantage, with 45 percent saying they trust him more and 39 percent expressing greater confidence in the Republicans\u2019 approach. The margin may be surprisingly slender, given big majority support for a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants and strong Latino support for Obama in the November election. \n \n Nor does the election seem to have produced a lasting consensus on which side is better equipped to figure out what government spending should be cut and what services preserved. When it comes to finding the right balance, 44 percent side with Republicans and 43 percent with the president. \n \n The poll also confirms one of the political verities of deficit reduction: People may want to see an end to red ink, but there is rarely public support for reductions in popular social programs to achieve it. \n \n Asked about alternatives to the automatic cuts now in place, 71 percent reject a reduction in Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor, and 60 percent oppose raising the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67. \n \n There is broader but still limited support for slicing business tax deductions. Most, 56 percent, say they back limiting tax deductions for high-income earners as part of a path out of the sequester. Tax reform is often considered a quid pro quo for reining in entitlement spending, which is a long-term driver of deficit spending. \n \n A Post-ABC News poll last week found broad opposition to the across-the-board cuts to the military that started March 1 with the sequester, but there is majority support in the new survey for more targeted defense cuts. \n \n Cohen is director of polling for Capital Insight, the independent polling group of Washington Post Media.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Before his second inauguration, President Obama enjoyed a 55% approval rating\u2014but thanks to concerns over the economy, the figure has dropped again to 50%, a Washington Post-ABC News poll finds. Following Obama's reelection, Americans trusted him over congressional Republicans on the economy by 18 points; now the gap is just four points in Obama's favor, 44% to 40%, the Post reports. Obama's 50% mark puts him behind most modern presidents at this moment in their second terms\u2014with the exception of George W. Bush, who also had a 50% approval rating. As for the sequester, a slight majority opposes it, but some three-quarters say it hasn't had an effect on them. On the other hand, most believe it will eventually hurt the economy.

    "document": "Neanderthal DNA has subtle but significant impact on human traits \n \n SHARELINES Tweet Hooked on cigarettes? Your Neanderthal DNA might be to blame \n \n Tweet Neanderthal DNA linked to dozens of human traits and diseases \n \n \n \n \n \n Since 2010 scientists have known that people of Eurasian origin have inherited anywhere from 1 to 4 percent of their DNA from Neanderthals. \n \n The discovery spawned a number of hypotheses about the effects these genetic variants may have on the physical characteristics or behavior of modern humans, ranging from skin color to heightened allergies to fat metabolism\u2026generating dozens of colorful headlines including \u201cWhat your Neanderthal DNA is doing for you\u201d and \u201cNeanderthals are to blame for our allergies\u201d and \u201cDid Europeans Get Fat From Neanderthals?\u201d \n \n Now, the first study that directly compares Neanderthal DNA in the genomes of a significant population of adults of European ancestry with their clinical records confirms that this archaic genetic legacy has a subtle but significant impact on modern human biology. \n \n \u201cOur main finding is that Neanderthal DNA does influence clinical traits in modern humans: We discovered associations between Neanderthal DNA and a wide range of traits, including immunological, dermatological, neurological, psychiatric and reproductive diseases,\u201d said John Capra, senior author of the paper \u201cThe phenotypic legacy of admixture between modern humans and Neanderthals\u201d published in the Feb. 12 issue of the journal Science. The evolutionary geneticist is an assistant professor of biological sciences at Vanderbilt University. \n \n Some of the associations that Capra and his colleagues found confirm previous hypotheses. One example is the proposal that Neanderthal DNA affects cells called keratinocytes that help protect the skin from environmental damage such as ultraviolet radiation and pathogens. The new analysis found Neanderthal DNA variants influence skin biology in modern humans, in particular the risk of developing sun-induced skin lesions called keratosis, which are caused by abnormal keratinocytes. \n \n In addition, there were a number of surprises. For example, they found that a specific bit of Neanderthal DNA significantly increases risk for nicotine addiction. They also found a number of variants that influence the risk for depression: some positively and some negatively. In fact, a surprisingly number of snippets of Neanderthal DNA were associated with psychiatric and neurological effects, the study found. \n \n \u201cThe brain is incredibly complex, so it\u2019s reasonable to expect that introducing changes from a different evolutionary path might have negative consequences,\u201d said Vanderbilt doctoral student Corinne Simonti, the paper\u2019s first author. \n \n According to the researchers, the pattern of associations that they discovered suggest that today\u2019s population retains Neanderthal DNA that may have provided modern humans with adaptive advantages 40,000 years ago as they migrated into new non-African environments with different pathogens and levels of sun exposure. However, many of these traits may no longer be advantageous in modern environments. \n \n One example is a Neanderthal variant that increases blood coagulation. It could have helped our ancestors cope with new pathogens encountered in new environments by sealing wounds more quickly and preventing pathogens from entering the body. In modern environments this variant has become detrimental, because hypercoagulation increases risk for stroke, pulmonary embolism and pregnancy complications. \n \n In order to discover these associations, the researchers used a database containing 28,000 patients whose biological samples have been linked to anonymized versions of their electronic health records. The data came from eMERGE \u2013 the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute \u2013 which links digitized records from Vanderbilt University Medical Center\u2019s BioVU databank and eight other hospitals around the country. \n \n This data allowed the researchers to determine if each individual had ever been treated for a specific set of medical conditions, such as heart disease, arthritis or depression. Next they analyzed the genomes of each individual to identify the unique set of Neanderthal DNA that each person carried. By comparing the two sets of data, they could test whether each bit of Neanderthal DNA individually and in aggregate influences risk for the traits derived from the medical records. \n \n \u201cVanderbilt\u2019s BioVU and the network of similar databanks from hospitals across the country were built to enable discoveries about the genetic basis of disease,\u201d said Capra. \u201cWe realized that we could use them to answer important questions about human evolution.\u201d \n \n According to the evolutionary geneticist, this work establishes a new way to investigate questions about the effects of events in recent human evolution. \n \n The current study was limited to associating Neanderthal DNA variants with physical traits (phenotypes) included in hospital billing codes, but there is a lot of other information contained in the medical records, such as lab tests, doctors\u2019 notes, and medical images, that Capra is working on analyzing in a similar fashion. \n \n Additional co-authors are Lisa Bastarache, Dan Roden, Jeffrey Prato and Joshua Denny from Vanderbilt; Benjamin Vernot, David Carrell, David Crosslin, Gail Jarvik and Joshua Akey from the University of Washington; Erwin Bottinger from Mount Sinai School of Medicine; Rex Chisholm from Northwestern University; Scott Hebbring from the Marshfield Clinic; Iftikhar Kullo and Jyotishman Pathak from the Mayo Clinic; Rongling Li from the National Human Genome Research Institute; Marylynn Ritchie and Shefali Verma from Pennsylvania State University; Gerard Tromp from the Geisinger Health System; and William Bush from Case Western Reserve University. \n \n The research was funded by National Institute of Health grant 5T32EY021453 plus National Human Genome Research Institute grants to members of the eMERGE Network. \n \n Media Inquiries: \n \n David Salisbury, (615) 322-NEWS \n \n david.salisbury@vanderbilt.edu ||||| Thank you for your interest in spreading the word about Science. \n \n NOTE: We only request your email address so that the person you are recommending the page to knows that you wanted them to see it, and that it is not junk mail.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's long been known that the predecessors of modern humans and Neanderthals lived side by side, but it wasn't until 2010 that it was discovered the two species interbred. In fact, as much as 4% of the DNA of modern humans with European or Asian ancestry comes from Neanderthals, reports the Guardian. That intermingling is bound to have consequences, but researchers who've been looking for them were surprised to find a dozen traits specifically linked to Neanderthal genetic variants\u2014including risk for nicotine addiction, artery thickening, heart attack, and depression. Researchers arrived at their conclusions, published in the journal Science, after cross-referencing Neanderthal DNA with a database of 28,000 people of European ancestry that pulls together biological samples and electronic health records. \"The brain is incredibly complex, so it's reasonable to expect that introducing changes from a different evolutionary path might have negative consequences,\" lead author Corinne Simonti says in a Vanderbilt News statement. Case in point: The researchers found Neanderthal DNA increases blood clotting, which would have helped seal wounds more speedily; but for modern man, hypercoagulation ups the risk of miscarriage, stroke, and more, reports Live Science. Oh, and the popular idea that Neanderthal DNA influences skin tone is probably bunk, the researchers add, noting skin color differences likely emerged much more recently.

    "document": "CLOSE Director Brian Henson explains how Melissa McCarthy's sugar-snorting scene in \"The Happytime Murders\" was done. USA TODAY \n \n Maya Rudolph (left) and Melissa McCarthy share screen time with puppets in the comedy \"The Happytime Murders.\" (Photo: HOPPER STONE/STX ENTERTAINMENT) \n \n Hardcore puppet sex and four-letter words that would make Big Bird blush sound like a googly-eyed good time until you\u2019re faced with 90 unfunny minutes of it. \n \n \"The Happytime Murders\" (\u2605\u00bd out of four; rated R; in theaters nationwide Friday) tries hard, and annoyingly so, to be a raucous, adult-oriented departure from the Muppets and denizens of \u201cSesame Street,\u201d one in which an octopus milks a cow to orgasmic effect and a bunny shops for chicken porn. Stuffed full of rampant badness, the scattershot comedy isn\u2019t nearly as clever or subversive as it thinks it is. \n \n Set in a world where men and puppets co-exist, though the latter are second-class citizens, the noir-ish narrative centers on blue-skinned former cop (and now private eye) Phil Phillips (puppeteer Bill Barretta) and his human ex-partner, L.A. detective Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy). A violent incident in the past soured their relationship \u2013 and resulted in a ban on puppet cops \u2013 so when they run into each other at a crime scene, snarky and vicious banter ensues. \n \n Sandra puts the moves on private eye Phil in \"The Happytime Murders.\" (Photo: HOPPER STONE/STX ENTERTAINMENT) \n \n A robbery gone wrong at a puppet sex store and a series of dead bodies (usually with stuffing falling out of them) leads Phil to believe that the stars of cheesy 1990s-style sitcom \u201cThe Happytime Gang,\u201d the first hit to feature both human and puppet stars, are being targeted. The show just happens to be up for syndication, which means a windfall for those still alive. \n \n To solve the case, Phil and Connie form an uneasy alliance and begin to reconnect as they delve into a puppet underworld of bunny-filled strip clubs, sugar-snorting poker games and assorted places unfit for colorful characters who look like rejects from a children\u2019s program. (\"Sesame Street\" notably sued filmmakers and lost, worrying the explicit content would tarnish its brand. No worries there, since the only thing this film ruins is an hour and a half of your life.) \n \n More: 'Happytime Murders' shocks with raunchy puppets (not Muppets) \n \n Also: How Melissa McCarthy really 'snorted' puppet drugs in 'Happytime Murders' \n \n More: 10 movies you absolutely must see this fall, from 'Halloween' to 'A Star Is Born' \n \n There is definite artistry in the puppeteering for director Brian Henson (son of legendary Muppets creator Jim Henson): Phil, his client/love interest Sandra (Dorien Davies), pervy rabbit Mr. Bumblypants (Kevin Clash, formerly Elmo) and others have lived a hard-luck and/or oversexed life, and it shows in their felt bodies. But by the time one character poops plastic eggs and another ejaculates Silly String, the novelty of puppets behaving badly is long gone. \n \n Exotic dancer Jenny (Elizabeth Banks) entertains her rabbit clientele in \"The Happytime Murders.\" (Photo: HOPPER STONE/STX ENTERTAINMENT) \n \n The gags make Fozzie Bear a comedic genius by comparison, but at least the talented human actors keep the film from being a \u201cHappytime\u201d disaster. McCarthy is as sharp-witted as ever with one-liners and caustic put-downs, Maya Rudolph boosts the proceedings as Phil\u2019s loyal secretary Bubbles, and Elizabeth Banks has a fun role as an exotic dancer also connected to the resident gumshoe. \n \n Yet all the film's most interesting aspects have been done better elsewhere. \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\" is the gold standard for portraying cutesy personalities as a disenfranchised population, and \"Happytime Murders\" completely fumbles that theme. It unfortunately doesn\u2019t fully commit to the raunch the way, say, \"Sausage Party\" does. And nothing touches \"Team America: World Police\" when it comes to hilarious puppet intercourse. \n \n At the risk of being as Muppet-y self-righteous as Sam the Eagle, there are much better uses of your time than this travesty of fluffy shenanigans. \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2w96Slx ||||| Rescue me, Elmo! \n \n That\u2019s what you\u2019ll shout if you\u2019re trapped in a movie theater playing \u201cThe Happytime Murders,\u201d the wretched puppets-behaving-badly comedy directed by Brian Henson. \n \n The son of Muppets creator Jim Henson has delivered a clich\u00e9-ridden, laughless bore that wastes lead actress Melissa McCarthy\u2019s prodigious comic talents and beats well-trod territory with a mallet. \n \n \u201cThe Happytime Murders\u201d is as fresh as the old \u201cWayne\u2019s World\u201d jokes it shoves in. It\u2019s a movie in which puppet crabs make cracks about getting pelvic crabs, and the line \u201cLooks like the carpet doesn\u2019t match the drapes\u201d is uttered twice. \n \n As stale as a neglected saltine, the flick is another police-noir parody with all the familiar hallmarks: brooding narration, a cigarette-smoke-filled office, a door with a frosted window and a helpless blond bombshell. Think \u201cWho Framed Roger Rabbit\u201d minus the innovation or fun. \n \n The bawdy tale is set in a decrepit Los Angeles that\u2019s plagued by crime, and where our felt-y friends are an oppressed minority. Kids yell \u201cstupid puppet!\u201d and beat them up, while the word \u201csock\u201d is now a racial slur. \n \n The smoky office belongs to Phil Philips (Bill Barretta), a puppet private investigator and former cop. He was kicked off the LAPD years earlier when, his bosses believe, he purposefully didn\u2019t gun down a puppet perp. His human partner, Detective Connie Edwards (McCarthy), was nearly killed in the botched operation. \n \n That bumbling duo is thrust back together when puppet and human cast members of popular TV show \u201cThe Happytime Gang,\u201d including Phil\u2019s famous stuffed brother, start getting killed off one by one. He goes rogue to solve the case with Connie. \n \n What\u2019s not solved is the film\u2019s No. 1 problem: It\u2019s not funny. \n \n Most bits are either gross or groaners. A gag involving boudoir silly string is amusing until it becomes nauseating. Watching McCarthy snort puppet crack didn\u2019t make me crack a smile. The only cast member who earns some giggles is Maya Rudolph as Phil\u2019s secretary, who\u2019s secretly in love with him. She\u2019s a comedy alchemist who can turn turds into gold. \n \n \u201cThe Happytime Murders\u201d is the latest addition to McCarthy\u2019s do-not-see CV. Since \u201cBridesmaids,\u201d filmmakers have slapped her in mostly dumb schlock like this. \n \n Being a Henson project, you\u2019d expect the film\u2019s puppetry to be the one redeemable factor. But those characters are strangely generic and clumsily handled. Forgettable. \n \n There\u2019s more fun to be had watching a kid play with some socks. ||||| \u201cThese aren\u2019t the Muppets,\u201d director Brian Henson might remind us, but his smile and wink would hint at what he really thinks. The son of Muppets creator Jim Henson and the man who filled his dad\u2019s shoes directing The Muppet Christmas Carol and Muppets Treasure Island, Henson has decided to cross over to the dark side with his \u201calternative Muppets\u201d farce, The Happytime Murders. Careful to avoid copyright issues (and to avoid giving kids nightmares), Henson doesn\u2019t give us a faux Kermit or Miss Piggy. However, although all the puppets in The Happytime Murders are new, they are obviously Muppets, regardless of how vociferously the filmmakers may deny it. Wink, wink, nudge, nudge, say no more, say no more. \n \n Despite being one of the shortest theatrical releases of the year, clocking in at about 75 minutes (not counting end credits), The Happytime Murders feels overlong. That\u2019s probably because the plot is nonsensical and pointless. This is all about the concept of oversexed, hard-swearing Muppets interacting with humans in an alternative universe version of L.A. The film\u2019s \u201chigh concept\u201d catches the attention, but it\u2019s like the first time we heard Betty White drop the f-bomb. There was a certain shock value, it was worth a laugh, but where do you go from there? It\u2019s the same thing with nasty Muppets. The transgressive element is edgy and at times amusing, but it wears thin quickly and once it has worn out, we\u2019re left with warmed-over Dashiell Hammett, complete with the Sam Spade-inspired voiceover. \n \n Recognizing that there has to be something more than Muppets cursing, flashing their crotches in imitation of Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct, and doing un-family friendly things, Henson sets up the puppet culture as a thinly-veiled allegory. The social commentary about puppet discrimination and marginalization isn\u2019t subtle but it gives The Happytime Murders a claim to being more than a raunchy look at what happens on Sesame Street when the cameras are turned off. \n \n The Happytime Murders reunites two former partners, (human) LAPD detective Connie Edwards (Melissa McCarthy) and (puppet) PI Phil Phillips (voice of Bill Barretta), when an investigation into a series of puppet murders involves them both. For Connie, it\u2019s her job. For Phil, it\u2019s personal \u2013 his brother is the second victim. All of the dead \u201csocks\u201d were stars of a once-popular TV show, The Happytime Gang (the first program with a mostly-puppet cast to achieve \u201ccrossover\u201d popularity \u2013 a nod to The Cosby Show). Additional deaths indicate an inside job and, once the finger of suspicion points to Phil, it\u2019s up to Connie to solve the crime and clear her ex-partner. Aiding her in this endeavor is Phil\u2019s secretary, Bubbles (Maya Rudolph), who has a crush on her boss. \n \n The film\u2019s puppet/human dynamics are strange. All the energy and color resides with the puppets. In an odd reversal of what one might expect, they are more animate than their human counterparts. Melissa McCarthy, for example, has the life of a piece of background furniture \u2013 a surprise since, even in her worst films, she\u2019s normally able to dominate the screen. Fading into the background isn\u2019t her style but that\u2019s what happens here. The situation is only a little better with Maya Rudolph and Elizabeth Banks (whose role, as The Happytime Gang\u2019s only human, is small). Leslie David Baker (as Connie\u2019s lieutenant) and Joel McHale (as a racist FBI agent) gain attention by being as cartoonish as possible. \n \n The noir mystery element never works. Fortunately, it\u2019s treated as a framework and the filmmakers aren\u2019t overly invested in attempting to mine deeply into the territory. The Happytime Murders is intended primarily as a comedy and, while there\u2019s a cheeky freshness in the early scenes, it eventually becomes tiresome and a little off-putting. This would seem like the perfect playground for McCarthy, so it\u2019s strange that she seems so out of place. \n \n The obvious antecedent to The Happytime Murders is Who Framed Roger Rabbit? The differences, however, go beyond the derivative nature of the former. While Roger Rabbit felt like a fully-formed story worth telling, The Happytime Murders too often comes across as a skit that runs for too long. Everything about the movie is stunted \u2013 from the running time to the production values to the story. Although it might work perfectly well on television (there are enough bawdy laughs to ensure an acceptable level of entertainment), it never gels on the big screen. This is unquestionably a better bet for home viewing than a trip to a theater. \n \n \n \n \n \n Happytime Murders, The (United States/China, 2018) ||||| 1.5 stars (out of 4) \n \n Hi there, everyone! This Happytime Murders review is brought to you by the letter \u201cI.\u201d Insipid. Imbeciles. Incomprehensible. Insane. You can use that last word in a sentence such as \u201cThe person that thought this witless, crude black noire puppet farce would be a rousing crowd-pleaser must be insane.\u201d The letter also can be used on its own, as in \u201cI think we have a strong contender for the worst film of 2018.\u201d \n \n Let\u2019s address the stuffed elephant in the room: This scathing review isn\u2019t a case of a critic not having the bawdy sense of humor gene required to appreciate crass humor, OK? Married with Children and Howard Stern are two of my all-time favorite pop culture touchstones. I have a brother. I\u2019m not offended or shocked by the sight of two puppets having porn star sex. Just make it brutally funny and inspired. The Happytime Murders simply goes for the lowest common denominator of comedy from beginning to end. And those 90 minutes in between are excruciating. Let me put it in italics for emphasis. Excruciating. \n \n This was never going to be a genius hybrid of Avenue Q meets The Great Muppet Caper. Not with this old-timey set-up: Hard-nosed detective Phil Phillips (voiced by Bill Barretta) is the only puppet to have ever served on the police force. Now he\u2019s a private eye working on behalf of marginalized puppets in Los Angeles. After his brother gets stuffed out, he starts investigating and realizes that someone is killing all the stars of a popular 80s kids TV show called The Happytime Gang. Who would do such a thing?! \n \n To solve the case, Phil is paired with his former human partner. She\u2019s played by Melissa McCarthy, who does her usual obnoxious, tough-talking caricature shtick. The two are not on good terms, as evidenced by the fact that McCarthy bites down on Phil\u2019s man part in a moment of pent-up rage. The novelty of puppets acting like lewd rejects from Sausage Party or Team America: World Police is already worn off by the time McCarthy enters the picture. She does nothing with the limp script. Same goes for Maya Rudolph, Joel McHale and Elizabeth Banks. \n \n The tangled web of The Happytime Gang syndication contract negotiations won\u2019t raise anyone\u2019s pulse, so the filmmakers (writer Todd Berger and director Brian Henson) rely heavily on the R-rated shock factor. The piece de resistance, as seen in The Happytime Murders trailer, involves a graphic and messy sexual encounter that drags on and on and on until all traces of laughter have been metaphorically squeezed out. You\u2019ll see that in Act 1. Or, you know, just watch the trailer for free. \n \n There actually is a place and time for puppets behaving badly. Even a family-driven product as accessible as The Muppet Show had an air of subversion \u2014 and Kermit the Frog and Justin Timberlake once wrestled each other on a memorable episode of Saturday Night Live. But despite Henson\u2019s lineage as the son of late Muppets creator (and genius) Jim Henson, The Happytime Murders is a terribly misguided move. Indeed, it doesn\u2019t take an investigator with a heart of felt to figure out that a half-baked flick with poorly executed ideas and lazy use of gross-out humor will end up DOA. \n \n The Happytime Murders opens in theaters on Friday, August 24. \n \n For the latest TV news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast \u201cWatch With Us\u201d below! \n \n \n \n \n \n Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox! \n \n Want stories like these delivered straight to your phone?

Two clashing detectives with a shared secret, one human (Melissa McCarthy) and one puppet, are forced to work together again to solve the brutal murders of the former cast of a beloved classic puppet television show.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Remember the hubbub over this trailer with NSFW puppets? Well, The Happytime Murders is out Friday, starring Melissa McCarthy as a detective probing a series of puppet murders with her puppet partner. Critics, meanwhile, are busy investigating why the R-rated film is, in their opinions, downright awful. (The film has a 26% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.) What they're saying: While \"there's a cheeky freshness in the early scenes,\" the film \"too often comes across as a skit that runs for too long \u2026 probably because the plot is nonsensical and pointless,\" James Berardinelli writes at ReelViews. McCarthy surprisingly doesn't help, he writes. She \"has the life of a piece of background furniture.\" Brian Truitt argues \"McCarthy is as sharp-witted as ever,\" but his praise basically ends there. With gags that \"make Fozzie Bear a comedic genius by comparison,\" this \"scattershot comedy isn't nearly as clever or subversive as it thinks it is,\" he writes at USA Today, adding \"there are much better uses of your time than this travesty.\" \"There's more fun to be had watching a kid play with some socks,\" Johnny Oleksinski writes at the New York Post, noting the film is \"as stale as a neglected saltine.\" The prevailing problem: \"It's not funny,\" Oleksinski writes. In fact, \"the only cast member who earns some giggles is Maya Rudolph.\" Mara Reinstein is just relieved her viewing experience is over. \"The Happytime Murders simply goes for the lowest common denominator of comedy from beginning to end. And those 90 minutes in between are excruciating. Let me put it in italics for emphasis. Excruciating,\" she writes at US Weekly, calling out the \"lazy use of gross-out humor.\"",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 \"Hardcore puppet sex and four-letter words that would make Big Bird blush sound like a googly-eyed good time until you\u2019re faced with 90 unfunny minutes of it.\" That's what critics are saying about The Happytime Murders, an R-rated flick starring Melissa McCarthy, Maya Rudolph, and a bunch of puppets. Director Brian Henson \"tries hard, and annoyingly so, to be a raucous, adult-oriented departure from the Muppets and denizens of Sesame Street, one in which an octopus milks a cow to orgasmic effect and a bunny shops for chicken porn,\" writes Brian Truitt at USA Today. \"Stuffed full of rampant badness, the scattershot comedy isn\u2019t nearly as clever or subversive as it thinks it is.\" \"The only cast member who earns some giggles is Maya Rudolph as Phil's secretary, who\u2019s secretly in love with him,\" writes Andrew O'Hehir at Salon. \"She's a comedy alchemist who can turn turds into gold.\" \"This is unquestionably a better bet for home viewing than a trip to a theater,\" writes Manohla Dargis at the New York Times.",

    "document": "Chip Somodevilla/Getty Harper Lee, photographed here in 2007, received the Presidential Medal of Freedom. \n \n While Monroeville, Ala., is Harper Lee's hometown, she made New York City her town by choice. \n \n It was here she wrote the bulk of \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and sweated through the many rewrites of what would become one of the most cherished novels of the 20th century in an airless, one-bedroom apartment in Yorkville. \n \n What has been little spoken of until now is the crucial role a New York couple played in bringing the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Mockingbird\" to the page. \n \n In Mary McDonagh Murphy's documentary, \"Hey Boo: Harper Lee & To Kill a Mockingbird,\" opening Friday at the Quad Cinema, Joy and Michael Brown sit down before the cameras for a rare interview. They relate how they came to give Lee the gift of a year free to write without the need to earn a living. \n \n It was Christmas Eve, 1956, when Lee showed up at the apartment of her dear friends with her own modest presents. She'd been working for several years as an airline reservations clerk in a midtown office. She couldn't get the time off to head home for the holidays, so she came to the Browns. \n \n Lee wrote about the evening for McCall's magazine after \"Mockingbird\" was published in 1960, recalling how she found an envelope addressed to her in the branches of the Christmas tree. \n \n \"I opened it and read: 'You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas.' \n \n \"'It's a fantastic gamble,' I murmured, 'a great risk.' \n \n \"My friend looked around his living room, at his boys half buried under a pile of Christmas wrapping paper. His eyes sparkled as they met his wife's and they exchanged a glance ... \n \n \"Then he looked at me and said softly: 'No, honey, it's not a risk. It's a sure thing.'\" \n \n After briefly stepping into the public eye, the Browns have become reticent again in the wake of a controversy over an as-yet-unpublished biography of Lee. Excitement spread when Penguin Press announced that \"The Mockingbird Next Door\" had been written by a former Chicago Tribune reporter with input from Lee. \n \n Lee, who is now 85 and suffered a stroke in 2007, made a statement through her 99-year-old sister Alice's law firm that she had not \"willingly participated\" with author Marja Mills. Mills then produced a letter, one prepared by her and signed by Alice, vouching that both sisters had acted as \"invaluable guides.\" The matter is unresolved. \n \n Meanwhile, the Browns speak eloquently in the documentary as Michael, a Broadway lyricist who performed in supper clubs around town, explains that in 1949 he received a letter from his friend Truman Capote, \"in tiny, little handwriting,\" saying a friend of his was coming to New York and \"would you kindly look after her.\" \n \n The friend was Capote's childhood soulmate, Nelle Harper Lee, who had quit the University of Alabama to become a writer. \n \n Those first years in Manhattan were rough going, says Charles J. Shields, author of the biography \"Mockingbird.\" But though she would walk down streets smacking parking meters to shake loose dimes and nickels, Lee had an exceptional social life. \n \n \"She sort of followed Truman around. He was a literary lion and gave her entree,\" according to Shields. \"All she would say about herself at parties was that she was from Alabama and working on a book.\" \n \n That she was, thanks to the Browns. Michael had received a lump-sum payment, and Joy, a former ballerina who had studied with George Balachine, immediately thought to give it to Nelle. \n \n \"I knew that if she could get her work seen that she'd have it,\" Michael recalls, adding later. \"But I never, never foresaw anything like this. Like what happened.\" \n \n Joy still sounds incredulous more than 50 years later. \n \n \"They published 5,000 copies for heaven's sake. Who was going to buy 5,000 copies of this book?\" \n \n In fact, that first printing of \"Mockingbird\" fell at least 30 million copies short of the eventual demand. \n \n After Lee retreated from fame, sidestepping all public exposure, New York City offered the anonymity that allowed her to ride the subways and visit secondhand bookstores without having to answer what came to be a harrowing question: When was the second book coming? \n \n As Anna Quindlen, who pays homage in \"Hey Boo\" along with other notables like Tom Brokaw and Oprah Winfrey, muses: \"I don't know if she felt she couldn't do it, but I prefer to think she wouldn't do it.\" \n \n Lee being Lee, what are the chances we'll ever find out? ||||| Or his spur to a sales force: \n \n You gotta be a good greeter \u2014 \n \n Sell the car! \n \n You gotta turn on the heater \u2014 \n \n Sell the car! \n \n And when you get to St. Peter \u2014 \n \n Sell the car! \n \n Sell the Edsel for \u201959! \n \n For DuPont, Mr. Brown created \u201cWonderful World of Chemistry,\u201d a show that in all likelihood has had the greatest number of performances of any musical in history. \n \n Marion Martin Brown Jr. was born on Dec. 14, 1920, in Mexia, Tex. As a youth, he played the piano and wrote songs; at 15, he entered the University of Texas. After receiving his bachelor\u2019s degree there while still a teenager, he earned a master\u2019s in English from the University of Virginia. \n \n After wartime service as a cryptographer, Mr. Brown moved to New York, where he adopted the name Michael. He became a regular at supper clubs, including the Blue Angel, performing his own satirical compositions. \n \n One of his best-known original songs from this period is \u201cFall River Hoedown,\u201d a.k.a. \u201cLizzie Borden.\u201d A lively ensemble number written for the Broadway revue \u201cNew Faces of 1952,\u201d it contained this memorable lyric: \n \n Oh, you can\u2019t chop your mama up in Massachusetts \n \n And then blame all the damage on the mice. \n \n No, you can\u2019t chop your mama up in Massachusetts. \n \n That kind of thing just isn\u2019t very nice. \n \n The Chad Mitchell Trio popularized that song and another by Mr. Brown, \u201cThe John Birch Society,\u201d which included these lines: \u201cYou cannot trust your neighbors, or even next of kin./If mommy is a Commie then you gotta turn her in.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n His most widely seen show was without doubt \u201cWonderful World of Chemistry.\u201d Presented in the DuPont pavilion at the 1964 World\u2019s Fair in New York, it was a rare example of an industrial musical open to the public. The show, written, produced and directed by Mr. Brown, was performed at least 40 times a day, by at least eight companies, for months on end. \n \n Seen by an estimated five million people, the show, 24 minutes long, played some 17,000 performances. Broadway\u2019s longest-running musical, \u201cPhantom of the Opera,\u201d by contrast, has had about 11,000 performances since opening in 1988. \n \n It was the modest windfall from just such an industrial show \u2014 a musical fashion show for Esquire magazine in the fall of 1956, Joy Brown recalled last week \u2014 that let Mr. Brown and his wife help usher \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d into being. \n \n The Browns had met Ms. Lee through her friend Truman Capote. Mr. Brown had contributed lyrics to a song in the 1954 Broadway musical \u201cHouse of Flowers,\u201d with a book by Mr. Capote and music by Harold Arlen. \n \n By 1956, Ms. Lee, an Alabama native, was living in New York. Her longed-for career as a writer was stymied by the need to pay the rent, and she was toiling away as an airline reservations clerk. \n \n That Christmas, visiting the Browns, she spied an envelope with her name on it in the branches of their tree. \n \n \u201cI opened it and read: \u2018You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas,\u2019 \u201d Ms. Lee recalled in a 1961 essay in McCall\u2019s magazine in which she did not identify the Browns by name. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic gamble,\u201d Ms. Lee, in the words of her essay, told Mr. Brown. \u201cIt\u2019s such a great risk.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cHe looked at me,\u201d the essay continued, \u201cand said softly: \u2018No, honey. It\u2019s not a risk. It\u2019s a sure thing.\u2019 \u201d \n \n The result, \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d was published in 1960, and for nearly a half-century afterward the Browns and Ms. Lee kept their secret.

B. Lippincott & Company, planned for it in 1960. \u201cWe thought, they\u2019re printing 5,000 copies,\u201d she recalled. \u201cWho in the world is going to buy 5,000 copies?\u201d \n \n According to its current publisher, HarperCollins, \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d has been translated into more than 40 languages and has sold 30 million copies worldwide, a sure thing if ever there was one.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If it hadn't been for a New York City couple, the world might never have seen To Kill a Mockingbird. Its author, Harper Lee, was a ticket agent for British Overseas Airways in 1956, and it was difficult for her to find time to write with a separate full-time job, Ozy reports. She discussed this concern with her friends Michael and Joy Brown, a couple her friend Truman Capote had introduced to her. Michael, who died this year, worked as a writer of industrial musicals\u2014performances, often with big budgets, that US corporations would produce to inspire their workers, the New York Times reports in his obituary. Michael Brown's work included, for example, a \"Love Song to an Electrolux\" and a DuPont musical called Wonderful World of Chemistry. The work brought in plenty of money, and at Christmas 1956, Lee found an envelope for her in the Browns' Christmas tree. \"I opened it and read: 'You have one year off from your job to write whatever you please. Merry Christmas,'\" she wrote in the 1960s, as the New York Daily News reported. Though she was reluctant to accept the gift\u2014which she eventually repaid\u2014the couple supported her during the period, allowing her to quit her job and write To Kill a Mockingbird. That gift's impact continues to reverberate, as the book still sells more than 750,000 copies per year, Ozy notes. (Lee, now 87, has had her fair share of trouble in recent years: She recently sued her agent as well as a museum in her hometown.)",

Meanwhile, Iraq\u2019s president names a new prime minister to replace Nouri al-Maliki. (Reuters) \n \n Some Yazidis find new shelter in northern Iraq, as U.S airstrikes continue to target Islamic State positions. Meanwhile, Iraq\u2019s president names a new prime minister to replace Nouri al-Maliki. (Reuters) \n \n Iraq\u2019s president on Monday asked a veteran Shiite politician, Haider al-Abadi, to form a new government, setting the stage for a vicious political showdown in a country already struggling to contain an Islamist extremist insurgency. \n \n As his already limited political support crumbled, the incumbent prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, dug in for a fight. He argued that the appointment of the 62-year-old Abadi as prime minister-designate was legally invalid. \n \n The clash has raised deep concerns at home and abroad about Iraq\u2019s teetering stability. Ominously, Maliki reminded the country in a televised address Monday of his position as head of the armed forces and assured soldiers that the \u201cerror\u201d will be rectified. \n \n For a second day, blue-and-white armored personnel carriers belonging to security forces that answer directly to Maliki were stationed around the Green Zone. A hulking tank sat at one of the entrances to the secured zone, which houses government buildings. The armed forces remained on high alert, officials said, though Saad Maan, a spokesman for the Baghdad Operations Command, maintained that the deployment was routine. \n \n \u201cWe are entering a potential clash,\u201d said an Iraqi official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic. \u201cOn the ground, [there are] tanks and armored vehicles.

Khalid Mohammed/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \n \n In a sign of U.S. concern, President Obama on Monday publicly announced his backing for Abadi, saying that his nomination was \u201ca promising step forward.\u201d Both he and Vice President Biden called Abadi to express their support. \n \n Abadi now has 30 days to form a government, and during that time Maliki will remain the caretaker prime minister. \n \n The U.S. government has said it will significantly expand aid to Iraq in its battle with al-Qaeda-inspired militants only if it forms a government that embraces the country\u2019s different religious and ethnic groups. \n \n \u201cThe only lasting solution is for Iraqis to come together and form an inclusive government,\u201d Obama told reporters in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, Mass., where he is vacationing. \n \n In his eight years as premier, Maliki has consolidated power in his office, ruling in an authoritarian style that has chipped away at his support among minority Sunnis, as well as his fellow Shiites. He is widely blamed for fostering an environment that has allowed Sunni extremists from the Islamic State to seize control of huge chunks of Iraqi territory. \n \n But in the face of a chorus of calls for him to leave \u2014 from the country\u2019s religious authorities, his political rivals and even members of his own bloc \u2014 Maliki has stubbornly refused. Pressure to form a new government has mounted amid fears that Islamist extremists will exploit any vacuum. Maliki maintains, however, that since his bloc won the most seats in parliament in national elections this spring, he should be the one leading the next government. \n \n Hours after Iraqi President Fouad Massoum asked Abadi to form a government, the enraged outgoing premier made a televised address lambasting the move and declaring that he personified the governing State of Law coalition. \n \n \u201cI am Nouri al-Maliki, and I am the head of State of Law, and I am the head of Dawa [party], and no one has the right to deal under our name without my approval,\u201d he said, in a speech that suggested his desperation. \n \n But his State of Law coalition has crumbled, with 38 of its 96 parliamentarians signing a letter to the president declaring their support for Abadi. They were among 127 Shiite politicians who supported Abadi\u2019s bid in the 328-seat parliament. Abadi will probably be able to form a majority with support from Kurdish and Sunni factions, analysts said. \n \n Indeed, a late-night show of force Sunday \u2014 when Maliki announced that he would sue the president rather than acquiesce to the naming of a new prime minister and deployed security forces to strategic points in the capital \u2014 appeared to have galvanized efforts to oust him. \n \n \u201cIt has backfired and was unwise,\u201d said Hoshyar Zebari, a Kurd who served as foreign minister in the Maliki government. \u201cWe have passed the stage of military coups and taking power by force.\u201d \n \n The army indicated Monday that its loyalties do not lie with Maliki. \n \n \u201cWe are the army of Iraq, not of Maliki,\u201d the armed forces said on its official Twitter account. \u201cWe will continue to fulfill our promises, and for our nation we shall be defenders.\u201d \n \n But Iraq\u2019s security forces are fragmented and in disarray after a partial collapse of the army in June. \n \n Maliki has also built up a support base in Iraq\u2019s militias, most notably the notorious Asaib Ahl al-Haq, whose fighters were out in force for a second night Monday. However, analysts argue that Asaib and others are ultimately loyal to Iran, which has also withdrawn its backing for Maliki. \n \n The Obama administration has deployed its top officials to encourage a smooth transition to a government led by Abadi, a seasoned member of Maliki\u2019s party. \n \n In a phone call Monday morning with Massoum, Biden commended the Iraqi president for nominating the prime minister and emphasized Obama\u2019s \u201cdesire to boost coordination with a new Iraqi government and Iraqi Security Forces to roll back gains\u201d by the Islamic State, according to a statement. So far, a U.S. air campaign against the insurgents has largely been contained to the country\u2019s mostly Kurdish north. \n \n In his speech Sunday night, Maliki accused the United States of supporting a breach in the Iraqi constitution. \n \n Maliki on Monday filed a letter with Iraq\u2019s Supreme Court arguing that Abadi\u2019s appointment is null and void. His argument centers on a technicality: that his State of Law bloc, rather than a wider Shiite coalition, should have been allowed to nominate the president and that he is the only one who can speak for it. Human rights organizations have in the past complained that he controls the judiciary. \n \n \u201cThey stabbed us in the back,\u201d Jumaa al-Adwani, a member of the State of Law coalition who is sticking by Maliki, said Monday, calling the move a coup. \n \n Iraqi and U.S. officials hope that a new leader will help bridge the country\u2019s rifts and bring Iraq\u2019s disaffected Sunni minority back into the political process, eroding support for the Sunni extremists. \n \n Abadi, a British-educated engineer who hails from the capital, Baghdad, still faces an uphill battle. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s a fresh face in a sense,\u201d said Kirk Sowell, a political risk analyst and publisher of the newsletter Inside Iraqi Politics, who also described Abadi as a \u201cgray suit kind of guy.\u201d \u201cBut this isn\u2019t a radical change, it\u2019s a modest change.\u201d \n \n Abadi, a former communications minister, told state television that his first task as prime minister would be to curb the influence of the Islamic State. \n \n Anne Gearan in Sydney, Mustafa Salim in Baghdad and Ahmed Ramadan in Beirut contributed to this report. ||||| BAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Iraq's new president on Monday snubbed the powerful incumbent Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and nominated the deputy parliament speaker to form the new government, raising fears of more infighting in the government as country faces the threat of Sunni militants in the north. \n \n U.S. and Kurdish flags flutter in the wind as displaced Iraqis from the Yazidi community cross the Syria-Iraq border at Feeshkhabour bridge over the Tigris River at Feeshkhabour border point, in northern...

In a midnight speech, al-Maliki said he was filing a suit against the president for neglecting to name him prime minister by Sunday's deadline and all but demanded he be renominated. \n \n Critics say al-Maliki, a Shiite, contributed to the crisis by monopolizing power and pursuing a sectarian agenda that alienated the country's Sunni and Kurdish minorities. \n \n Al-Ibadi's nomination came hours after al-Maliki deployed his elite security forces in the streets of Baghdad, partially closed two main streets \u2014 popular spots for pro and anti-government rallies \u2014 as hundreds of his supporters took to the streets. \n \n \"We are with you, al-Maliki,\" they shouted, waving posters of the incumbent premier, singing and dancing. \n \n Mohammed al-Ogeili, a lawmaker from al-Maliki's list, rejected the nomination of al-Ibadi arguing that this move \"runs against the constitution\" because al-Maliki's party is the largest bloc and the National Alliance has no right to present any candidate. \n \n \"This decision would lead the country to a big problem and the president bears full responsibility for this situation,\" he told The Associated Press. \n \n Also Monday, senior U.S. officials said the Obama administration, which launched airdrops and airstrikes last week to support Kurdish and Iraqi forces battling militants from the Islamic State group, has begun directly providing weapons to the Kurdish peshmerga forces who have started to make gains against the al-Qaida breakaway group.",

    "document": "Yad Vashem recently received a most-unusual artifact from the Nazi era \u2013 a Nazi family magazine featuring an image of the perfect Aryan baby on its cover, The Telegraph reported Tuesday. \n \n The twist is that the baby was a Jew, whose picture was knowingly submitted in a contest in order to mock Aryan philosophy and whose true identity was never revealed. \n \n That baby was Hessy Taft nee Levinsons, whose parents had moved from Latvia to Berli to pursue classical music careers and would later flee to Paris and Cuba, eventually landing in the United States. \n \n Taft's full story has long been on the website of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and in the \"Holocaust Chronicles\" book, but the occasion of her donating her yellowing copy of the Sonne ins Haus magazine sparked new interest in this incredible story. \n \n As Taft, a professor, recalls, her mother took her to a well-known photographer in Berlin in 1935 to have her baby picture taken and was horrified to see Hessy's image on the magazine's cover months later. \n \n She was afraid the family would be exposed as Jews, but when she told the photographer, Hans Ballin, he told her he \"deliberately submitted the photograph to a contest to find the most beautiful Aryan baby,\" according to The Telegraph. \n \n \"I wanted to make the Nazis ridiculous,\" the photographer told her. \n \n Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels allegedly chose the photograph personally. \n \n Even though relatives in Memel, now in Lithuania, saw the photograph, the Nazis apparently never discovered the true identity of their perfect Aryan baby. \n \n The Levinsons family fled Germany after the father was temporarily jailed \u2013 and released with the help of his Nazi accountant \u2013 in 1938, heading for Paris. After the city fell to the Nazis, the French resistance helped the family escape to Cuba. The family moved to the United States after the war. \n \n \u201cI feel a little revenge,\u201d The Telegraph quoted her as saying on the occasion of presenting her photograph to Yad Vashem. \u201cSomething like satisfaction.\u201d ||||| When Hessy Taft was six months old, she was a poster child for the Nazis. Her photograph was chosen as the image of the ideal Aryan baby, and distributed in party propaganda. But what the Nazis didn\u2019t know was that their perfect baby was really Jewish. \n \n \u201cI can laugh about it now,\u201d the 80-year-old Professor Taft told Germany\u2019s Bild newspaper in an interview. \u201cBut if the Nazis had known who I really was, I wouldn\u2019t be alive.\u201d \n \n Prof Taft recently presented the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Israel with a Nazi magazine featuring her baby photograph on the front cover, and told the story of how she became an unlikely poster child for the Third Reich. \n \n Her parents, Jacob and Pauline Levinsons, both talented singers, moved to Berlin from Latvia to pursue careers in classical music in 1928, only to find themselves caught up in the Nazis\u2019 rise to power. \n \n Her father lost his job at an opera company because he was Jewish, and had to find work as a door-to-door salesman. \n \n In 1935, with the city rife with anti-semitic attacks, Pauline Levinsons took her six-month-old daughter Hessy to a well-known Berlin photographer to have her baby photograph taken. \n \n A few months later, she was horrified to find her daughter\u2019s picture on the front cover of Sonne ins Hause, a major Nazi family magazine. \n \n Terrified the family would be exposed as Jews, she rushed to the photographer, Hans Ballin. He told her he knew the family was Jewish, and had deliberately submitted the photograph to a contest to find the most beautiful Aryan baby. \n \n Hessy Taft looks through the photographs of her as a child, which were used for Nazi posters (Ohad Zwigenberg, Yedioth Ahoronot) \n \n \u201cI wanted to make the Nazis ridiculous,\u201d the photographer told her. \n \n He succeeded: the picture won the contest, and was believed to have been chosen personally by the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. \n \n Frightened she would be recognised on the streets and questions asked about her identity, Prof Taft\u2019s parents kept her at home. \n \n Her photograph appeared on widely available Nazi postcards, where she was recognised by an aunt in distant Memel, now part of Lithuania. But the Nazis never discovered Prof Taft\u2019s true identity. \n \n In 1938, her father was arrested by the Gestapo on a trumped up tax charge, but released when his accountant, a Nazi party member, came to his defence. \n \n After that, the family fled Germany. They moved first to Latvia, before settling in Paris only for the city to fall to the Nazis. \n \n With the help of the French resistance, they escaped again, this time to Cuba, and in 1949 the family moved to the United States. \n \n Today the Jewish woman who was once a Nazi poster child is a professor of chemistry in New York. \n \n \u201cI feel a little revenge,\u201d she said of presenting her photograph to Yad Vashem. \u201cSomething like satisfaction.\u201d ||||| A birthday card featuring the picture of Hessy Levinsons, winner of the most beautiful Aryan baby contest. \n \n Hessy Levinsons (now Hessy Levinsons Taft) is the older daughter of Jacob and Pauline (Levine) Levinsons, both talented singers who came from Latvia to Berlin in the 1920s and studied voice at the Hochscule fuer Musik. The two were married in 1928 in Latvia but returned to Berlin to pursue their careers. In 1932, using his legal stage name, Yasha Lenssen, Jacob signed a contract with the Breslau opera to perform as their leading baritone in a series of 19 operas. However, shortly before the season opened, his contract was abruptly cancelled when he was asked to add his original surname to the agreement, a name that immediately identified him as a Jew. After Hitler's rise to power, the Levinsons were increasingly uneasy about their prospects for the future. They turned for advice to the Latvian consul in Berlin, who assured them Hitler would not last long and predicted a flourishing musical career for them after his demise. As foreigners, the Levinsons were somewhat protected from the anti-Jewish economic legislation that was directed against German Jews. Thus Jacob was able to secure a position as the Berlin representative of a Latvian-based firm. \n \n \n \n Hessy Levinsons was born in 1934. When she was six months old, Hessy was taken to a leading Berlin photographer to have her portrait taken. A few months later this picture appeared on the cover of the Nazi publication, \"Sonne ins Haus\" [Sun in the House]. Frightened by the possible consequences of their exposure as foreign-born Jews, Hessy's mother rushed to the photographer. He explained that he had known she was a Jewish child and had deliberately submitted her photograph to a contest for the most beautiful Aryan baby in order to ridicule Nazi racial theory, and Hessy was selected as winner of the contest among all the German babies. Several months later an aunt in Memel recognized Hessy's portrait on a picture postcard in a local store and sent it to the Levinsons in Berlin. The card was captioned \"Best wishes for the birthday.\" After the publication of her photograph Hessy was kept largely at home lest she be recognized in the street and her parents questioned about her identity. In 1936 her sister Naomi was born. That same year her father was arrested by the Gestapo on a trumped-up tax charge. He was released only after his accountant, a Nazi party member, came to his defense. Following this incident the Levinsons left for Latvia, where they remained for a year until deciding to move to Paris in 1938. The family had fully reestablished itself when the Germans entered Paris. Jacob applied for American visas but had no way of knowing when they might come through. In 1941, when the round-up of foreign Jews began in Paris, the Levinsons fled to Memac-sur-Mer, a coastal town near Bordeaux. From there they were led by members of the French resistance to Nice. In the meantime Jacob received notice that their American visas had arrived, but that only 45 days remained to get to the U.S. before the visas would expire. Unable to find immediate transport to the United States, Jacob applied for an extension of their U.S. visas. The U.S. Department of Immigration denied these extensions. Jacob then secured Cuban visas for the family and booked passage on the Serpa Pinto, a Portuguese ship that left from Lisbon in early in 1942 for Havana. The family spent the next seven years in the Cuban capital, where Hessy and her sister grew up. In 1948 the Levinsons reapplied for immigration to the U.S. and arrived in New York in 1949. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",

The Telegraph resurfaces the remarkable story of Hessy Taft (born Hessy Levinsons), a now 80-year-old who in 1935, at just six months, was taken by her mother to a Berlin photographer to have her baby photo taken. Months later, Pauline Levinsons spied her daughter's photo on the cover of the Nazi magazine Sonne ins Hause. Worried their Jewish identity would surface as a result, she hurried back to Hans Ballin, who explained to her that he \"wanted to make the Nazis ridiculous\"\u2014and so the photographer intentionally entered the young Hessy into a contest looking for the most beautiful Aryan baby, one thought to be judged by Joseph Goebbels himself. The truth of the baby's identity never came to light, though Hessy was kept out of public sight by her parents, who feared she'd be recognized. A short time later the family fled Germany for Latvia, then Paris, Cuba, and finally the United States. Haaretz points out that Taft's story isn't an untold one: In fact, it's published on the US Holocaust Memorial Museum website. But it's getting a fresh look after Taft recently gave Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial a copy of the magazine cover. \"I feel a little revenge,\" the Telegraph quotes her as saying. \"Something like satisfaction.\" (In other Nazi news: Was Hitler a billionaire tax dodger?)",

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A man in Algeria apparently picked a terrible way to get attention on social media\u2014and now he'll pay for it in prison. On Monday an Algerian court sentenced the unnamed man to two years after he posted to Facebook a photo of himself dangling a baby out of a 15th-story window in an attempt to get \"likes,\" reports Al Arabiya English. The photo shows the baby being held by a single hand outside the apartment building in the capital city of Algiers over the caption \"1000 likes or I will drop him.\" The BBC reports that other social media users quickly denounced the photo, and police charged the man with endangering the life of a child when they arrested him on Sunday. The man, who is a cousin of the baby's, swears the whole thing was a misunderstanding. The Independent reports he told Algeria's Ennahar TV the photo was manipulated by Facebook users to make it look worse than it actually was, claiming the \"protective barriers\" that were present were digitally removed. The boy's father also said he believed the man was just being playful and asked the court for mercy. Last week another man was jailed over photos shared to Facebook.",
