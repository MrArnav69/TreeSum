In a new study in the August 2014 Pediatrics, \u201c Sleep Environment Risks for Younger and Older Infants ,\u201d published online July 14, researchers studied sleep-related infant deaths from 24 states from 2004-2012 in the case reporting system of the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths. Cases were divided by younger (0-3 months) and older (4 months to one year) infants. In a total of 8,207 deaths analyzed, majority of the infants (69 percent) were bed-sharing at the time of death. Fifty-eight percent were male, and most deaths occurred in non-Hispanic whites. Younger infants were more likely bed-sharing (73.8 percent vs. 58.9 percent), sleeping on an adult bed or on/near a person, while older infants were more likely found prone with objects, such as blankets or stuffed animals in the sleep area. Researchers conclude that sleep-related infant deaths risk factors are different for younger and older infants. Parents should follow the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations for a safe sleep environment and understand that different factors reflect risk at different developmental stages. ||||| Sharing a bed and objects in bed are the biggest risk factors for sleeping infants, according to a new study. \n \n The study published in the journal Pediatrics on Monday found that babies aged 0-3 months were most likely to die as a result of bed-sharing. For older infants ages four months to a year, the greatest risk for sleep-related death is objects in the sleep environment, the study found. \n \n The study relied on a database compiled between 2004 and 2012\u2014using information from 24 states\u2014by the National Center for the Review and Prevention of Child Deaths. Researchers analyzed 8,207 deaths in total. \n \n Of the younger victims, 74% were sharing a bed at the time of their death. The study defines \u201cbed-sharing\u201d as sleeping with a person or an animal. Of the older victims, 39% of deaths happened in a sleep area containing an object such as a blanket or a pillow. And 18% changed their sleeping position from on their side or on their back to prone. \n \n But the study makes it clear that it hasn\u2019t uncovered any clear cause and effect. Instead it states its \u201cobjective was to determine any associations between risk factors for sleep-related deaths at different ages.\u201d \n \n The American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines on safe sleep environments suggest placing babies on their back on a firm surface, in the same room as their parents, and with no soft objects or loose bedding until the age of one. ||||| \u200bBy: Rachel Y. Moon, MD, FAAP \n \n More than 3,500 babies in the U.S. die suddenly and unexpectedly every year while sleeping, often due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) or accidental deaths from suffocation or strangulation. \n \n In an effort to reduce the risk of all sleep-related infant deaths, the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) updated policy statement and technical report includes new evidence that supports skin-to-skin care for newborn infants; addresses the use of bedside and in-bed sleepers; and adds to recommendations on how to create a safe sleep environment. \n \n Note: All of these recommendations, unless mentioned otherwise, are for babies up to 1 year of age. Talk with your pediatrician if you have questions about any of the recommendations listed. \n \n Until their first birthday, babies should sleep on their backs for all sleep times\u2014for naps and at night. We know babies who sleep on their backs are much less likely to die of SIDS than babies who sleep on their stomachs or sides. The problem with the side position is that the baby can roll more easily onto the stomach. Some parents worry that babies will choke when on their backs, but the baby's airway anatomy and the gag reflex will keep that from happening. Even babies with gastroesophageal reflux (GERD) should sleep on their backs. \n \n Newborns should be placed skin-to-skin with their mother as soon after birth as possible, at least for the first hour. After that, or when the mother needs to sleep or cannot do skin-to-skin, babies should be placed on their backs in the bassinet. While preemies may need to be on their stomachs temporarily while in the NICU due to breathing problems, they should be placed on their backs after the problems resolve, so that they can get used to being on their backs and before going home. \n \n Some babies will roll onto their stomachs. You should always place your baby to sleep on the back, but if your baby is comfortable rolling both ways (back to tummy, tummy to back), then you do not have to return your baby to the back. However, be sure that there are no blankets, pillows, stuffed toys, or bumper pads around your baby, so that your baby does not roll into any of those items, which could cause blockage of air flow. \n \n If your baby falls asleep in a car seat, stroller, swing, infant carrier, or sling, you should move him or her to a firm sleep surface on his or her back as soon as possible. \n \n Use a firm sleep surface. A crib, bassinet, portable crib, or play yard that meets the safety standards of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is recommended along with a tight-fitting, firm mattress and fitted sheet designed for that particular product. Nothing else should be in the crib except for the baby. A firm surface is a hard surface; it should not indent when the baby is lying on it. Bedside sleepers that meet CPSC safety standards may be an option, but there are no published studies that have examined the safety of these products. In addition, some crib mattresses and sleep surfaces are advertised to reduce the risk of SIDS. There is no evidence that this is true, but parents can use these products if they meet CPSC safety standards. \n \n Room share\u2014keep baby's sleep area in the same room where you sleep for the first 6 months or, ideally, for the first year. Place your baby's crib, bassinet, portable crib, or play yard in your bedroom, close to your bed. The AAP recommends room sharing because it can decrease the risk of SIDS by as much as 50% and is much safer than bed sharing. In addition, room sharing will make it easier for you to feed, comfort, and watch your baby. \n \n Only bring your baby into your bed to feed or comfort. Place your baby back in his or her own sleep space when you are ready to go to sleep. If there is any possibility that you might fall asleep, make sure there are no pillows, sheets, blankets, or any other items that could cover your baby's face, head, and neck, or overheat your baby. As soon as you wake up, be sure to move the baby to his or her own bed. \n \n Never place your baby to sleep on a couch, sofa, or armchair. This is an extremely dangerous place for your baby to sleep. \n \n Bed-sharing is not recommended for any babies. However, certain situations make bed-sharing even more dangerous. Therefore, you should not bed share with your baby if: \n \n Your baby is younger than 4 months old. \n \n Your baby was born prematurely or with low birth weight. \n \n You or any other person in the bed is a smoker (even if you do not smoke in bed). \n \n The mother of the baby smoked during pregnancy. \n \n You have taken any medicines or drugs that might make it harder for you to wake up. \n \n You drank any alcohol. \n \n You are not the baby's parent. \n \n The surface is soft, such as a waterbed, old mattress, sofa, couch, or armchair. \n \n There is soft bedding like pillows or blankets on the bed. \n \n Keep soft objects, loose bedding, or any objects that could increase the risk of entrapment, suffocation, or strangulation out of the baby's sleep area. These include pillows, quilts, comforters, sheepskins, blankets, toys, bumper pads or similar products that attach to crib slats or sides. If you are worried about your baby getting cold, you can use infant sleep clothing, such as a wearable blanket. In general, your baby should be dressed with only one layer more than you are wearing. \n \n It is fine to swaddle your baby. However, make sure that the baby is always on his or her back when swaddled. The swaddle should not be too tight or make it hard for the baby to breathe or move his or her hips. When your baby looks like he or she is trying to roll over, you should stop swaddling.",

A study published in August\u2019s Pediatrics journal says that sharing a bed, as well as items left in a baby\u2019s sleep area are risk factors in infant deaths, reports Time. How much of a factor depends on the baby\u2019s age: The study found that 74% of the younger infants who died (ages newborn to 3 months) were sharing a bed with another person or animal, while 39% of the older infants (ages 4 months to 1 year) were surrounded by blankets, pillows, stuffed animals, or other objects.

    "document": "By Daniel Burke, CNN Belief Blog Co-Editor \n \n Follow @BurkeCNN \n \n (CNN) - Pope Francis reaffirmed the Catholic Church's opposition to gay marriage on Wednesday, but suggested in a newspaper interview that it could support some types of civil unions. \n \n The Pope reiterated the church's longstanding teaching that \"marriage is between a man and a woman.\" However, he said, \"We have to look at different cases and evaluate them in their variety.\" \n \n States, for instance, justify civil unions as a way to provide economic security to cohabitating couples, the Pope said in a wide-ranging interview published Wednesday in Corriere della Sera, an Italian daily. State-sanctioned unions are thus driven by the need to ensure rights like access to health care, Francis added. \n \n A number of Catholic bishops have supported civil unions for same-sex couples as an alternative to marriage, including Pope Francis when he was Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 2010, according to reports in National Catholic Reporter and The New York Times. \n \n Behind closed doors, pope supported civil unions in Argentina, activist says \n \n But Wednesday's comments are \"the first time a Pope has indicated even tentative acceptance of civil unions,\" according to Catholic News Service. \n \n Later on Wednesday, a Vatican spokesman sought to clarify the Pope's remarks. \n \n \"The Pope did not choose to enter into debates about the delicate matter of gay civil unions,\" said the Rev. Thomas Rosica, a consultant to the Vatican press office. \n \n \"In his response to the interviewer, he emphasized the natural characteristic of marriage between one man and one woman, and on the other hand, he also spoke about the obligation of the state to fulfill its responsibilities towards its citizens.\" \n \n \"We should not try to read more into the Pope\u2019s words than what has been stated in very general terms,\" Rosica added. \n \n Pope Francis, who marks his first year in office on March 13, has sought to set a more tolerant tone for his 1 billion-member church and suggested that a broad range of topics are at least open for discussion. \n \n In January, the Pope recalled a little girl in Buenos Aires who told her teacher that she was sad because \"my mother's girlfriend doesn't like me.\" \n \n \"The situation in which we live now provides us with new challenges which sometimes are difficult for us to understand,\" the Pope told leaders of religious orders, adding that the church \"must be careful not to administer a vaccine against faith to them.\" \n \n The Vatican later denied that those comments signaled an opening toward same-sex unions. \n \n Last June, Francis famously refused to judge gay priests in comments that ricocheted around the world. He has also said that the church should not \"interfere\" in the spiritual lives of gays and lesbians. \n \n Pope Francis' greatest hits of 2013 \n \n Support of same-sex unions of any type is fiercely contested by many Catholic church leaders. \n \n In Wednesday's interview, Francis also addressed several other controversial issues, including the Catholic Church's ban on contraception, the role of women and the devastating clergy sexual abuse scandal. \n \n On contraception, the Pope praised Pope Paul VI for having the \"courage\" to \"go against the majority\" when restating the ban in 1968. But, Francis said, the church must also be \"merciful\" and \"attentive to concrete situations.\" \n \n Contraception and church's ban on divorced Catholics receiving holy communion, will likely be addressed at major meetings of Catholic bishops in Rome in 2014 and 2015. \n \n \u201cWe must give a response. But to do so, we must reflect much in depth,\u201d the Pope said Wednesday. \n \n On the role of women in the church, an issue of particular concern to Catholics in the United States, the Pope hinted that changes could be in the works. \n \n \"Women must be present in all of the places where decisions are taken,\" Francis said in the newspaper interview, but the church must consider more than \"functional\" roles for women. To that end, Catholic leaders are engaged in \"deep reflection\" on women's role in the church, he said. \n \n On the sexual abuse of children by Catholic clergy, a scandal that has rocked the church in the United States, the Pope said the abuse has left \"very deep wounds\" on victims. \n \n In response, the church has done more than other institutions to be open and transparent about sexual abuse by its employees, Francis said. \u201cBut the Church is the only one to be attacked.\" \n \n A United Nations panel criticized Catholic leaders last month in a hard-hitting report on clergy sexual abuse. \n \n The report said the Vatican \"has not acknowledged the extent of the crimes committed, has not taken the necessary measures to address cases of child sexual abuse and to protect children, and has adopted policies and practices which have led to the continuation of the abuse by and the impunity of the perpetrators.\u201d \n \n The Vatican said it would study the U.N. report. \n \n Kick out those who sexually abuse children, U.N. panel tells Vatican \n \n On Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, who has surprised church-watchers with public appearances after saying he would live a cloistered life in retirement, Francis said he considers his predecessor a \"wise grandfather.\" \n \n \"The Pope Emeritus is not a statue in a museum,\" Pope Francis said. Rather, the two men have decided that Benedict should participate in the church's public life rather than live a shuttered life. \n \n \"I thought about grandparents who with their wisdom, their advice, strengthen families and don't deserve to end up in an old folks home,\" Francis said. \n \n Finally, he may sometimes wear a cape, but don't call Pope Francis a Superman, the popular pontiff said. \n \n \"To paint the Pope as a sort of Superman, a kind of star, seems offensive to me,\" Francis told Corriere della Sera. \"The Pope is a man who laughs, cries, sleeps soundly and has friends like everyone else. A normal person.\" \n \n Earlier this year, graffiti depicting a muscle-bound and flying Francis appeared on walls near Vatican City, but the Pope said Wednesday that he doesn't like the \"mythology\" surrounding his papacy, which marks its first anniversary on March 13. \n \n For instance, Francis debunked the idea that he sneaks out of the Vatican at night to feed the homeless. \n \n \"It never occurred to me,\" he said. \n \n (CNN's Delia Gallagher assisted in translating Pope Francis' remarks from the Italian.) ||||| VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis finds the hype that is increasingly surrounding him \"offensive,\" according to an interview published Wednesday, even as the Vatican itself is marking the anniversary of his election with commemorative stamps and coins and a DVD with never-before-seen footage of the pope. \n \n Francis told Italian daily Corriere della Sera he doesn't appreciate the myth-making that has seen him depicted as a \"Superpope\" (as an Italian street artist recently painted him) who sneaks out at night to feed the poor (as Italian newspapers have suggested). \n \n On Wednesday, he had to contend with a new bout of celebrity as \"My Pope\" hit Italian newsstands, a weekly gossip magazine devoted entirely to Francis. It is published by Mondadori, which is owned by ex-Premier Silvio Berlusconi's media empire. In addition, at his general audience, someone tried to give him a replica of an Oscar statue that said \"Oscar Pope\" on it. \n \n \"I don't like ideological interpretations, this type of mythology of Pope Francis,\" the pope told Corriere. \"If I'm not mistaken, Sigmund Freud said that in every idealization there's an aggression. Depicting the pope as a sort of Superman, a star, is offensive to me. \n \n \"The pope is a man who laughs, cries, sleeps calmly and has friends like everyone else. A normal person.\" \n \n Francis marks his anniversary as pope March 13. For the occasion, the Vatican has issued new coins and stamps. The DVD will feature behind-the-scenes footage of the pope leaving the Sistine Chapel just after he was elected and praying in the nearby Paoline Chapel before he went out onto the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to greet the world with his famous \"Buonasera.\" \n \n In the interview, Francis also said he and Pope Benedict XVI had agreed that the emeritus pontiff wouldn't remain hidden away, as Benedict had said he would spend his retirement, but would participate more in the life of the church. That's in keeping with Francis' belief that the elderly have a wealth of wisdom to offer younger generations. \n \n \"The emeritus pope isn't a statue in a museum. He's an institution,\" Francis said. \"We talked about it and we decided together that it would be better if he sees people, gets out and participates in the life of the church.\" \n \n Benedict recently attended the recent ceremony to formally install 19 new cardinals, the first time he and Francis had appeared together in St. Peter's. He is widely expected to attend the April 27 canonizations of Popes John Paul II and John XXIII. \n \n \"Some might have wanted him to retire away in a Benedictine abbey far from the Vatican,\" Francis said. \"I thought about grandparents who with their wisdom and advice give strength to their families and don't deserve to end up in an old folks' home.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Nicole Winfield at www.twitter.com/nwinfield ||||| 2014-03-03 Vatican Radio \n \n 00:01:53:81 \n \n (Vatican Radio) From March 1st, the magnificent gardens surrounding the papal summer residence at Castel Gandolfo are open to the public. Located south of Rome in the Alban hills, the property includes the extensive Barberini gardens, the remains of a Roman villa and a 62 acre farm, as well as the ancient papal palace. Philippa Hitchen takes a closer look:Listen:A statement from the director of the Vatican Museums says it was Pope Francis himself who decided to make accessible to all the gardens of the Pontifical Villas \u201cwhere the splendor of art and the glory of nature co-exist in admirable equilibrium.\u201d From Monday through Saturday mornings a one and a half hour guided tour of the gardens, in Italian or English, will be available to individuals or groups through an online booking system.The Barberini Gardens, as they\u2019re known, lie on the site of an ancient Roman villa built by Emperor Domitian, the third and last ruler of the Flavian dynasty. Visitors can still wander through the ruins of the imperial theatre and the crypto-portico, or covered passageway where the emperor and his guests could stroll while escaping from the summer heat.With stunning views over Lake Albano and beyond, to the coastline of the Mediterranean sea, the Villa has been a favourite holiday residence for the popes since the 17century. Under the Lateran Pact of 1929, the Villa became part of the extra-territorial possessions of the Holy See and underwent major restoration work. The pope of that time, Pius XI, oversaw the creation of a model farm which still produces eggs, milk, oil, vegetables and honey for local employees or for sale in the Vatican supermarket. Pope Pius XII, who allowed war refugees sanctuary in the Villa, died there in 1958, as did Pope Paul VI two decades later. Amongst the hidden treasures that visitors can enjoy are the magnolia garden, the path of roses and that of aromatic herbs, the square of holly oaks and the breathtaking Belvedere garden.For further details and bookings, visit the Vatican Museums website at: mv.vatican.va",

    "document": "[Full Text]This HRC study examines key factors in people\u2019s decisions to either adopt or give up a vegetarian or vegan diet, and the first set of findings being released compares individuals who currently eat a vegetarian or vegan diet with those who have been vegetarian or vegan in the past but now consume meat. The findings of the study offer some potentially disappointing but illuminating conclusions that could inform advocacy and outreach strategies. \n \n Abstract: \n \n In the US, the population of current vegetarians/vegans sits at approximately 2%, while approximately 10% of the population are former vegetarians/vegans and about 88% have never been veg. This study, published by HRC, looks closely at that 12% of the population that identifies as either current or former vegetarians/vegans, and tries to better understand what makes people lapse, and in turn, what factors might help keep people veg. The findings presented here offer a lot of possible avenues for new strategic thinking in veg advocacy, and how we might move the vegetarian/vegan diet from the margins more towards the center. \n \n Though there is rarely just one reason for people adopting or giving up a veg diet, it is not completely clear if lapses are due more to social pressures (eating a diet that seems unusual or outside the norm), or based on some other difficulty inherent to the diet itself. That being said, the findings do illuminate some things that many lapsed vegetarians/vegans have in common, such as transitioning to the diet too quickly, not being involved socially with other veg folks, and not being able to address certain food cravings. The study also shows that current vegetarians/vegans have a wide range of motivations that keep them veg, which may mean that more diverse messaging and outreach could have a positive impact. \n \n This phase of release is part of a larger study of U.S. vegetarians and vegans. You can read more about the key findings, as well as the see the tables and methodologies, in the attached PDFs. ||||| In 1995 I decided to stop eating meat. I could never really quite explain why, I think it was something to do with watching a documentary where they cooked a cat and partly because I had a really crap job working for Wolves Poly and felt my life was slipping away. It definitely wasn't anything to do with any 'vegetarian month'. \n \n I did a number of weird things. I experimented with stopping washing my hair (it got greasy), I stopped watching TV after catching Newsnight really stoned and deciding that Jeremy Paxman was fundamentally a comedian so there was little difference between the news and Beadle's About. I also stopped eating meat. \n \n First it was just red meat. I said goodbye in a Birmingham Burger King; the sandwich was greasy and unpleasant and I thought 'good riddance'. \n \n I found eating only white meat was hard. People didn't know what to cook for me - they'd tell me I was just being awkward. They were right, so there was only one thing for it, cutting out all meat altogether. \n \n So I simply stopped putting it in my mouth. It was that simple. I didn't feel any different and what I cooked didn't really change as I was a complete povvo and didn't bother buying much meat anyway. \n \n To be honest, I was the world's worst vegetarian. You see - I didn't really like vegetables very much. I'd spent most of my childhood terrified of them - horrid bland mushy things. It's only as an adult I realise that part of the problem is my mother's cooking - she hates using salt and has a tendency to over boil things. Thanks, Mum. \n \n So there we are. A vegetarian who hates vegetables and mostly lives on pasta and cheese. Healthy. \n \n Fast-forward nearly 15 years and I'm a father of two and increasingly aware of my diet. My wife stopped her vegetarian ways when pregnancy brought cravings for meat. \n \n With her help (this makes her sound like my sponsor in Fussy Eaters Anonymous) I'd managed to eat more vegetables - by the time our second child was in the womb she was having spinach cravings and I didn't complain once about having to eat boiled green leaves every day. For six months. So I was doing better with a wider diet but still no drinking from the meaty cup. \n \n My four-year-old son has the restricted palate that children often have. He mostly refuses to eat anything that isn't sausages or fruit, so dining out was becoming difficult. There was the small circle of cheesy carbs I'd eat, and the intersection with the circle of sausages that my son wants to eat was - well, if you understand your Venn diagrams you'll know there wasn't much in the middle. \n \n It was a trip to Hastings that finally did it. At a fish 'n' chip shop pretty much the only thing on the menu I could eat was a microwaved cheese pasty. I simply couldn't face it and ordered fish. \n \n Can't say I particularly enjoyed it. I found the portion of thick white flesh alarmingly large and I didn't want to think about the skin at all. However it did leave me feeling satisfied in a way that I haven't felt in a long time. Every cell in my body screaming \"protein - that's what you need.\" \n \n My wife was very impressed with me. She asked me what I wanted to try next and the thing that had been filling my thoughts since deciding to allow meat back into my life was pepperoni pizza. Those little toasted cups of fat that make for a party in the mouth everyone can afford. Although to ponce it up a bit we ate it in Hampstead. Lardy dah. \n \n Bacon. Let's talk about bacon. There's no meat more glorious than bacon. You can add it to pasta instead of cheese. You can stick it in a sandwich, er ... instead of cheese. Or even rub it on to attract men (a top tip there ladies). \n \n On telling my friends I was eating meat, one looked proud and said, \"Welcome back to Man Club.\" Although my new macho credentials were severely dented by the admission that largely I'd been eating chicken - \"Chicken? Why, us men class chicken as a vegetable.\" \n \n I still haven't tried real meat. I can do a spag bog or even a burger but no steaks. I'm still a bit frightened of them. All too fleshy. \n \n Many people must have had a similar experience. If you're a lapsed vegetarian (or a resurgent meat eater), what was it that made you fall off the vegetarian wagon? ||||| After decades of a growing appetite for meat, U.S. consumption is finally dropping after hitting \"peak meat\" a decade ago. But while many people are eating less meat, giving it up totally is much harder. Few people stick with their decision to become vegetarian or vegan. \n \n In an attempt to move animal-free diets \"from the margins more towards the center,\" the Humane Research Council just put out the first study to put numbers to the lapsed vegetarian phenomenon. Their main takeaway is essentially what people have said for years: getting people to reduce their meat and dairy intake will be more effective overall than demanding \"purity,\" or complete elimination of animal products from their diet. \n \n According to their research, drawn from a representative sample of more than 11,000 adults over age 17 in the U.S., while only 2% of the U.S. population is currently vegetarian or vegan, another 10% used to be. Put another way, they found that only 1 in 5 vegetarians and vegans maintains their diet; a full 84% eventually revert back to eating meat or other animal products. \n \n The study also shows how and why many people lapse. Most former vegetarians and vegans (65%) said they first transitioned to their veg diet in just a few days or weeks, while fewer current vegetarians (53%) transitioned that quickly, suggesting that perhaps a slower approach leads to longer-lasting results. They also found that the \"window of opportunity is limited,\" when it comes to getting people to stick to their diets: A third-of people abandoned their animal-free diets in three months or less, and more than half abandoned it within the first year. \n \n Reasons for quitting varied, but perhaps intuitively, a lot comes down to relationships. A third of all former vegetarians lived with a non-vegetarians or non-vegan partner when they went back to eating meat. The study also found that current vegetarians were more likely to cite multiple reasons for being vegetarian\u2014such as animal welfare, environmentalism, and personal health\u2014while many former vegetarians (58%) cited health as the main motivator. In other words, from the advocacy group\u2019s perspective, health can be an effective \"foot in the door\" approach to increasing the number of vegetarians and vegans, but often not enough to keep people animal-free for the long-term. \n \n The Humane Research Council also says advocates need to change the culture around being vegetarian or vegan and acknowledge its challenges. More than 60% of former vegetarians/vegans disliked sticking out from the crowd because of their diet, and 58% did not see their diet as part of their identity. Nearly 50% said they found it too difficult to maintain a \"pure diet.\" \n \n \"The latest findings once again show that a message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption,\" the report says. \"Advocates would be well advised to soften their appeals to avoid suggesting the choice is all or nothing.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It seems becoming a vegetarian and staying a vegetarian are two very different things. A whopping 84% of vegetarians end up eating meat again, and most people shift back within a single year, according to a new study. Specifically, 53% of vegetarians are meat-eaters again within 12 months, while more than 30% go back to meat within three months, the Huffington Post reports. Of the 11,000 people studied, 2% were vegetarians, 10% former vegetarians, and 88% lifelong meat-eaters. A major reason for lapsing, it seems, was social: Those who returned to being omnivorous didn't have enough support among friends for their vegetarian lifestyles. Earlier research points to health issues from staying meat-free, the Smithsonian reports. Some 35% of respondents to a separate survey of lapsed vegetarians said their own poorer health drove them back to animal flesh, Skeptoid reports. \"I will take a dead cow over anemia anytime,\" says one respondent. And in the Guardian, a lapsed vegetarian writes about the inconvenience of avoiding meat, as well as the feeling of \"every cell in my body screaming 'protein\u2014that's what you need.'\" Perhaps the writer would agree with the conclusions of the new study, as Co.Exist reports them: \"A message focused on reduction instead of elimination of animal products may be more effective to create an overall decline in animal product consumption.\" (Read about a veggie burger that \"bleeds\" like meat.)",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 When you think of the term \"vegetarian month,\" the first thing that probably comes to mind is \"purity.\" But for those of you who have never heard of it, well, you're not alone. A new study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences finds that about 10% of the population has never been a vegetarian or vegan, and that 12% of that population identifies as either current or former. The study, which looked at data from more than 1,000 interviews, found that more than 60% of former vegetarians/vegans \"disliked sticking out from the crowd because of their diet, and 58% did not see their diet as part of their identity-pure diet.\" The study found that current vegetarians and vegans are more likely to cite a number of reasons for being vegetarian, including animal welfare, environmentalism, and personal health. The New York Times reports that the study was based on interviews with more than 2,000 people who were between the ages of 15 and 17, and found that the average age at which a person stopped eating meat was 16.",

    "document": "Published on Feb 17, 2015 \n \n \"While you were chairman of the Commerce Committee, that committee set a record for unauthorized appropriations.\" \n \n - Steve Carell \n \n \n \n Footage from Comedy Central's Indecision 2000 coverage by The Daily Show (with Jon Stewart) ||||| Jon Stewart (The Daily Show host, 1999-2015): \n \n My wildest dream for The Daily Show when I started was \u201cThis will be fun. Hopefully we\u2019ll do it well.\u201d Success for me would\u2019ve been feeling like I figured it out. That I got to express the things I wanted to. It was never \u201cI want this to be a cultural touchstone . . . but only for a very small portion of America.\u201d And I was hoping to stay on TV longer than nine months this time. \n \n The Daily Show premiered on Comedy Central on July 22, 1996, at 11:30 P.M. The format loosely tracked that of a conventional newscast: five or so opening minutes called \u201cHeadlines,\u201d read by former ESPN anchor Craig Kilborn, followed by \u201cOther News,\u201d then usually a pre-taped \u201cfield piece\u201d with a correspondent, and finishing up with Kilborn interviewing an actor or a musician. \n \n Some segments played off the hard news of the day, like the presidential contest between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton. \u201cThere was more of a pop-culture-and-lifestyle component only because what we were satirizing\u2014particularly local news\u2014was doing a lot of that stuff,\u201d co-creator Lizz Winstead says. \u201cWe would make fun of the conventions of news. Like when TV reporters talk, how do you create drama in a story that doesn\u2019t exist?\u201d \n \n The day-to-day creative process of the first few years of The Daily Show centered on Winstead, fellow co-creator Madeleine Smithberg, and the writing staff. \u201cMy first day on the job,\u201d Winstead says, \u201cI have to pull the writers into my office and say, \u2018Guys, you can\u2019t have your mushroom dealer come up to the office.\u2019 \u201d Kilborn came up with the signature \u201cFive Questions\u201d conceit for guest interviews, but otherwise largely read from the script. \n \n In November 1996, Comedy Central\u2019s executives moved The Daily Show to 11 P.M., to replace Bill Maher\u2019s Politically Incorrect, which had jumped to ABC, but also to counter-program the late local news. \n \n Kilborn\u2019s Daily Show would peak at a nightly average of 357,000, yet Kilborn\u2019s audience was growing, and the show was generating critical buzz. Perhaps more important than the chatter was the fact that it was indeed reaching the younger male viewers Comedy Central president Doug Herzog had targeted in the first place. The combination caught the attention of CBS, and in 1998 it offered Kilborn the slot following Late Night with David Letterman, at 12:30 A.M. \n \n \u201cHe starts to get a little heat, we\u2019re starting to get a little attention with The Daily Show,\u201d Herzog says, \u201cand then the next thing you know Kilborn goes and signs with CBS without even telling us.\u201d \n \n Panic, followed by auditions: David Alan Grier, Michael McKean, Greg Proops, Bill Weir, and Mike Rowe came to the studio and sat in the host\u2019s chair. Daily Show correspondents Beth Littleford and Stephen Colbert got tryouts, too. But Herzog and other Comedy Central executives wondered about a black-leather-jacket-wearing stand-up comic, a guy who had hosted a short-lived MTV talk show produced by Smithberg. He had lost out to Conan O\u2019Brien as Letterman\u2019s NBC replacement; he had written a book of satirical essays; he had played Eve Harrington to Garry Shandling\u2019s Margo Channing on The Larry Sanders Show; and lately he\u2019d had some supporting roles in Hollywood rom-coms. Herzog didn\u2019t think the highly regarded, slightly adrift comedian would be interested in the job. But, hey, what did he have to lose in buying lunch for Jon Stewart? \n \n From The Neal Peters Collection. \n \n JAMES DIXON (manager for Jon Stewart, 1987-): \n \n After The Jon Stewart Show was canceled, he was . . . not burnt on being on TV, but he wanted to kind of wet his feet with film. We had this nice deal with Harvey Weinstein. \n \n JON STEWART: At the time, I was obviously making my mark in such films as Wishful Thinking and Dancing with Architecture, or Dancing About . . . Oh, no. They ended up calling it something else. Playing by Heart, I think it was. \n \n Getting fired from the talk show was the real turning point for me. Because I thought that, after appearing on Letterman, now I\u2019m a made man. I thought losing The Jon Stewart Show meant I was an unmade man. I realized you still have to make your act better. The goal is to produce, the goal is to make things. So I spent some time writing and performing on The Larry Sanders Show, and I learned a lot from Garry Shandling. \n \n JUDD APATOW (stand-up comic, writer, director): \n \n Garry had the foresight to write about the talk-show wars and this very subtle aspect of it, which is you support a young comedian, and slowly the network likes him more than it likes you, and then that younger guy, in ways that he understands and might not understand, slowly pushes you out of your job. Similar to what really happened with Leno and Conan and Fallon. So there was a moment when Garry was considering continuing The Larry Sanders Show and changing the name of it to The John Stewart Show, with an h so it wouldn\u2019t really be Jon. Everyone was excited about it for a while, but it went away. \n \n JON STEWART: The Daily Show wasn\u2019t necessarily on the radar. I think they called and said, \u201cHey, man, would you be interested in talking about this?\u201d\u2014something along those lines, something as romantic as that. \n \n JAMES DIXON: I definitely advocated for him to do it. I just said to him, \u201cYou can put this through your prism. You can make it smarter and different than what it\u2019s been.\u201d Now, I definitely didn\u2019t see the show becoming the political lightning rod that it evolved into. \n \n DOUG HERZOG (executive, MTV, 1984-95; president, Comedy Central, 1995-98; executive, Viacom, 2004-): \n \n In the summer of \u201898, when we announced that Jon was going to take over The Daily Show, we had a little press conference in the lobby of the old Comedy Central offices. And Stephen Colbert showed up, as a member of the press representing The Daily Show, wanting to know why he didn\u2019t get the job. \n \n STEPHEN COLBERT (correspondent, 1997-2005): \n \n \u201cYou told me he wasn\u2019t funny.\u201d That\u2019s what Jon said to Doug Herzog. \n \n MATT LABOV (publicist for Jon Stewart, 1994-2008): \n \n The stakes for Jon were fairly high at that point, because he\u2019s not a super-young guy anymore, and he\u2019s had shots, and people easily disappear and go into the woodwork. He didn\u2019t get the Conan job on NBC; he didn\u2019t get the 12:30 job after Letterman. If this doesn\u2019t work on fucking cable, then where would Jon have ended up? \n \n JON STEWART: A couple of months before I officially started as host there was a meeting with the writers and producers. Let\u2019s call that \u201cJonny\u2019s surprise party.\u201d I knew that the people working on the Kilborn show were rightfully proud of it. It had done well. It was not the sensibility that I thought was right for me, and so when they approached me for the show, I was pretty clear about the direction I thought I wanted to take it. Seemed like everybody was on board with that, and so this was my first chance to meet with all the people who, I had been told, were so excited about that. So excited. They\u2019re so happy you\u2019re here. \n \n And I walked in, and it was a room full of people who, as it turned out, were annoyed that I had an idea about where I wanted to go, who thought that I was going to MTV it up. I was told, \u201cThis isn\u2019t about bands. We do a real show here.\u201d I just sat there like \u201cOh, fuck.\u201d It felt a little bit like \u201cWow, none of this was in the brochure. The brochure said that this was oceanfront property.\u201d \n \n JAMES DIXON: I had to talk Jon down. Not from a tree\u2014from a skyscraper. Because they basically said to him, \u201cWelcome aboard. This is how we do shit here. Grab a chair.\u201d It was bullshit. \n \n PAUL RUDD (actor): \n \n Technically I was Jon\u2019s first Daily Show guest interview. I went to the University of Kansas, and my roommate, Stewart Bailey, became a segment producer who was with the show from the very beginning. I\u2019d been on Kilborn\u2019s Daily Show. When Jon replaced Craig, they wanted to do a test show so Jon could get used to the format. \n \n Stewart made his debut on Monday, January 11, 1999. His first joke was that Kilborn was \u201con assignment in Kuala Lumpur.\u201d His first headline, \u201cThe Final Blow,\u201d was about the Senate impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. His first guest was Michael J. Fox, then starring on ABC\u2019s Spin City. But Stewart looked, for the first months, very much the guest himself. Other than a new couch and desktop\u2014and blue script pages for Stewart to scribble on portentously, replacing Kilborn\u2019s white paper\u2014the set design was largely unchanged. The theme song, Bob Mould\u2019s \u201cDog on Fire,\u201d was the same. And Stewart\u2019s suits were so ill-fitting that they looked like they were inherited from his much taller predecessor. \n \n By Mike Blake/Reuters. \n \n JUSTIN MELKMANN (post-production supervisor; segment producer; later supervising producer, video department; 1997-): \n \n During the Kilborn era, it was about \u201cHow can we seem like we\u2019ve gone too far?\u201d With Jon, we went from creating the news\u2014creating funny spoof headlines\u2014to making fun of the news. That was a big change. \n \n MO ROCCA (correspondent, 1998-2003): \n \n Shortly after Jon arrived, we had done a bit about Dana Plato dying, and Jon felt bad about delivering a joke when the end of her life had been so pathetic. We had a meeting where he said he had resolved that the show needed to have a point of view and couldn\u2019t just be the kid at the back of the classroom throwing spitballs in all directions. I remember people trading the kind of glances that said, \u201cOh shit, this is going to be a disaster.\u201d \n \n JON STEWART: To be fair to the writers who stayed from Kilborn\u2019s show, they had a successful thing going. They thought of it as a continuation of their show. I thought it was a new show. To me it wasn\u2019t edgy or provocative to just take napalm to a bush for no reason. You wanted it to be pointed, purposeful, intentional, surgical. \n \n I felt like I walked in there with a very open \u201cO.K., so this will be great,\u201d and it was \u201cHey, motherfucker, you came here to kill a baby.\u201d \n \n KENT JONES (writer, 1996-2001): \n \n Well, I would not agree with that. I don\u2019t remember any of this being as hostile as it has been portrayed. I just don\u2019t. \n \n MADELEINE SMITHBERG (co-creator; executive producer, 1996-2002): \n \n Because of the point of view that had been created by Craig Kilborn sitting in the chair, the writers\u2019 role had inflated. Yeah, they were spoiled rotten, because almost every show in late night is talent driven. They got too big for their britches. \n \n JON STEWART: Six or eight weeks in, the writers called me into their office. They\u2019re like, \u201cYou can\u2019t change our jokes anymore.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say. \n \n So after a weekend of pacing and smoking and having tremendous Lincoln-Douglas debates on the couch by myself, I went back in, and it was horrible. I basically told them all to fuck off. \u201cYou work for me. And if you don\u2019t like the direction, O.K. I get that. Don\u2019t work here.\u201d \n \n \u201cTHERE WERE POINTS WHERE I THOUGHT . . . I\u2019VE GOT TO LEAVE,\u201d SAYS STEWART OF THE EARLY TURMOIL. \n \n There were points where I thought, I made the wrong decision. I\u2019ve got to leave. But I don\u2019t give up very easily. It was open hostility, which is so enjoyable. It became that sense of \u201cO.K., let\u2019s arm-wrestle.\u201d This will give you a hint of my personality of grudges. \n \n I didn\u2019t really have a game plan. I knew what I didn\u2019t want. But then turning it into what you did want was the next scenario, and that was going to take time, and effort, and accomplices. What I needed most were accomplices. \n \n BEN KARLIN (head writer, later executive producer, 1999-2006): \n \n I was living in Los Angeles, working with a bunch of guys from The Onion, selling pilots and doing punch-up on movies. We did a pilot for Fox called Deadline Now, at about the same time The Daily Show was launching. We kind of did the exact opposite. We didn\u2019t want to be winking at the audience. We wanted to play it straight and not really acknowledge we were a comedy show. We hired actors and went about trying to produce a news show that was very much in the spirit of the Onion newspaper. And, frankly, we were quite scornful of the Kilborn Daily Show. \n \n Our template host, when we\u2019d come up with show ideas, was always Jon Stewart. We loved Jon Stewart. So when it was announced that Jon was taking over The Daily Show, our little comedy-snob nerd group thought it was a bad move. For him. Comedy Central was still pretty second-tier, and that might even be nice. And Jon was the Letterman heir apparent. \n \n I got a call from my agent saying, \u201cListen, Jon is looking for a new head writer, loves The Onion, has heard that you\u2019re kind of the de facto leader of the Onion guys\u2019 group out in L.A. Would you be willing to come out to New York and meet with them?\u201d \n \n JON STEWART: I really liked his sensibility. Ben seemed to be concerned with hypocrisy and the silly fa\u00e7ades of politics. He seemed to know where the absurdity was, and that was an important change in focus for what we wanted to do. There\u2019s also a certain steeped-in-neurosis bathos that probably was a rhythm that we both clicked on. That similar Jewie Jewerman from Jewville. \n \n The big thing was to find somebody who had thoughts, who cared, who had an opinion. Part of what The Onion is, and part of what Ben was steeped in, was the idea of deconstruction as your first step of re-creation. So Ben was a natural fit, although he had not had the TV experience. \n \n From Comedy Central. \n \n BEN KARLIN: I was friendly with Bob Odenkirk and David Cross. They were kind of like the grand Pooh-Bahs of the alternative-comedy scene in L.A.\u2014Sarah Silverman, Janeane Garofalo, Patton Oswalt. It was that whole wave of comics. Bob and David said The Daily Show sounded like a great opportunity. So I sublet my apartment, sold my Harley, found someone to take my dog for a while, and came to New York with three duffel bags. \n \n JON STEWART: Ben walked into a buzz saw. \n \n BEN KARLIN: I\u2019m not going to talk shit about anybody. But the staff had its allegiances, and the things that they liked to do, and the way they liked to do it. Now you\u2019ve got this guy, Jon, who is a writer, who has a strong point of view. \n \n LIZZ WINSTEAD (co-creator; head writer, correspondent, 1996-1998): \n \n As much as I loved the original writers, I created some little monsters. Once Jon realized he needed to take charge, you can\u2019t afford to have people who are not in the Jon Stewart business. And so there\u2019s a bit of Kool-Aid drinking that has to take place. \n \n Karlin arrived as head writer in April 1999 and quickly formed a complementary duo with Stewart. Karlin pushed for a higher quotient of righteous anger in The Daily Show\u2019s jokes; Stewart had an innate sense of what would get big laughs. \n \n BEN KARLIN: We were very kindred spirits, with very similar points of view, and my critique of the show was very much in line with his problems with the show: Why are we going after these helpless targets? Maybe we should focus the power of this kind of big news show on things that are actually newsworthy, rather than just look through the paper for what seems funny. \n \n Clashes, pitting Stewart and Karlin against some of the holdover Kilborn writers, would flare for the next year, with one confrontation\u2014which became known inside the show as \u201cthe fuck-you meeting\u201d\u2014being leaked to the New York Post\u2019s \u201cPage Six.\u201d \n \n JON STEWART: I think that was the meeting where I said, \u201cYou\u2019re not a group. You\u2019re not a unit. You\u2019re not \u2018the writers.\u2019 You\u2019re individual writers that have been hired, and you will be judged within that.\u201d It was just an attempt to reclaim some semblance of order. It was an absolute flat-out power struggle, but one that I felt blindsided by. \n \n BEN KARLIN: At one point during the battle for the heart and soul of the show, one of the writers snuck into Madeleine\u2019s office and replaced some of the items on the board that tracks the stories we\u2019re doing with personal insults. Some of them were about me; some were about other people. It was the most juvenile thing in the world. Jon and I used to have this thing: crazy out, sane in. We wanted to try to build a show of smart, funny, reasonable people with a similar vision who were hard workers. \n \n An enormous step in that direction was Karlin\u2019s first addition to the writing staff: a dizzyingly fast-thinking, cheerfully caustic 27-year-old who would become a major figure in the creative life of The Daily Show. \n \n DAVID JAVERBAUM (writer, later executive producer, 1999-2010): \n \n I\u2019d gone to Harvard and written for the Lampoon and Hasty Pudding, then I went to graduate school for musical-theater composition, at N.Y.U. It\u2019s arguably the most useless master\u2019s degree even by master\u2019s-degree standards. I had a lot of creative things I was interested in, but I had no idea what I wanted to do. I was temping for three years at law firms and Merrill Lynch. \n \n I knew Ben Karlin from a teen tour that we were on together, the thing where Jewish middle-class kids go around the country and pretend to rough it for six weeks. Ben, after college at Wisconsin, wound up working at The Onion, and he said, \u201cDo you want to contribute?\u201d So I began writing a lot of Onion headlines and some articles, and I had the idea for the book Our Dumb Century. \n \n Then I spent a year at Letterman as a writer, and I hated that. Not the people, per se, but it all comes from the top down, and Letterman, even at that point, which was \u201898 to \u201899, was just a detached, aloof figure who would stay there for, like, 13 hours a day for no reason. And I quit. I was making six figures. I\u2019d never made the upper half of five before, but it just was not worth it. It was crushing my soul. \n \n Ben was hired as the head writer for The Daily Show, and once again he called me and said, \u201cAre you interested in writing?\u201d So I owe Ben for both of those opportunities. I think I was Ben\u2019s first writing hire, in July 1999. \n \n BEN KARLIN: D.J. has genius-like qualities, almost to the point where\u2014it\u2019s not Asperger-y, because he\u2019s a funny, normal guy. But the way he can hold information, the speed with which his mind works, it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s got a broken brain that works really well in this way. I\u2019ve known him since he was 16 years old. He always was like this. \n \n Usually in a writers\u2019 room you know that this guy is my joke guy, that one is my story guy, that\u2019s my structure person. And D.J. has the ability to pitch individual jokes that are funny; he can come up with overarching structures that are funny; he can take over someone\u2019s script and make it better. \n \n In Karlin, and now Javerbaum, Stewart had hired invaluable off-camera allies. But he quickly recognized that he had inherited an indispensable on-camera co-conspirator. Stephen Colbert had a subversive streak that was greatly abetted by the fact that he looked like a trustworthy middle-American insurance salesman. \n \n By Al Levine/Comedy Central. \n \n STEPHEN COLBERT: It was a complete happy accident that I ended up at The Daily Show. I had been working for ABC at The Dana Carvey Show in 1996. That show got canceled, my wife wasn\u2019t working, and we had a baby. I desperately needed a job. Someone from the entertainment division recommended to the news division that if they were looking for somebody who was funny but looked really straight, for a correspondent for Good Morning America, that they should consider me. They hired me. I did exactly two reports. Only one of which ever made it to air. \n \n After those two reports, I pitched 20 stories in a row that got shot down. At the same time, my agent, James Dixon, who also represented Madeleine Smithberg, said, \u201cYou should meet with Madeleine. She\u2019s doing this other show, and I bet that they would do those stories.\u201d They had me on for a trial basis, and for the next nine months I worked at The Daily Show occasionally, during Craig Kilborn\u2019s second year. But it was totally a day job. I never expected to stay, because I did sketch comedy and I wrote, and I really didn\u2019t think that The Daily Show was going to go anyplace. \n \n JON STEWART: The first bit Stephen did on the show after I arrived, I think it was something about baby-back ribs. You could just feel: \u201cThis guy knows how to perform in a scene, is present, has an ease with language.\u201d The key then was \u201cWhat do we do with that?\u201d \n \n STEPHEN COLBERT: I don\u2019t really know why Jon and I worked together so well. It\u2019s hard to quantify, but it happened very early. When Jon first got there, he had a rough ride with some of the people who had worked with Craig. But I immediately knew he was a guy I should listen to. I saw how thoughtful he wanted to be about political comedy and how he invited us to have our own thoughts, invest the jokes with our own beliefs. And maybe he thought he could trust me. \n \n Changing the lineup of correspondents and contributors, the on-air faces of the show, was crucial, if less contentious. A. Whitney Brown and Brian Unger left when Kilborn did; Colbert, Rocca, Beth Littleford, Frank DeCaro, and Stacey Grenrock Woods stayed on. Stewart\u2019s first correspondent addition was Vance DeGeneres. Then Colbert helped recruit another major talent. \n \n STEVE CARELL (correspondent, 1999-2003): \n \n I got a call from Stephen Colbert. He and I were on The Dana Carvey Show together in the spring of 1996, and one of the sketches that we did was called \u201cWaiters Who Are Nauseated by Food.\u201d And Madeleine Smithberg, who had hired Stephen onto The Daily Show, saw that and asked who I was\u2014asked Stephen\u2014and then Stephen called me and said, \u201cWould you be interested maybe in doing a field piece?\u201d And then Madeleine called and followed up and asked if I\u2019d do a field piece out here in Los Angeles. Nancy [Walls Carell] and I were living out here at the time, and I had a holding deal with ABC. So we were just watching a lot of the Game Show Network. \n \n \u201cI REALLY DIDN\u2019T THINK The Daily Show WAS GOING TO GO ANYPLACE,\u201d SAYS COLBERT. \n \n We decided to stage the field piece right underneath the HOLLYWOOD sign, up in the Hills, and that I was going to do the walk-and-talk as I was essentially walking up the side of a mountain, and obviously play up the fact that I was really out of shape, that it was a very bad correspondent to have chosen for a walk-and-talk. \n \n Apparently Madeleine really liked that moment within the piece and thought that that was a good choice. They asked if I\u2019d move out to New York and be a regular on The Daily Show. \n \n No one was really familiar with this show. My agent didn\u2019t see it as a positive step in my career. Let\u2019s put it that way. They just saw it as a little nothing cable show. A job, but nothing that was going to amount to much. Jon had just become the host about six months before. \n \n JON STEWART: Carell, I knew very little about him. These guys didn\u2019t come from stand-up. I knew stand-ups. I knew Dave Attell, I knew Lewis Black. I did not know Vance, Mo, Steve, Stephen. \n \n BEN KARLIN: So much of the writing of The Daily Show actually comes down to brainstorming and coming up with the big-picture ideas. Once we started realizing what an incredible tool Carell and Colbert were, we said we\u2019ve got to bring more of that into the studio. Let\u2019s not just see them once a week or once every two weeks in a field piece. Let\u2019s get both those guys on the show several times a week in one form or another. They\u2019re too talented. \n \n What Stewart and his colleagues could not have known was that they had arrived at the perfect moment, with the media and political worlds on the cusp of upheaval. When Stewart first sat behind the fake anchor desk, the anchors of the real news were still a trio of white male eminences: Tom Brokaw at NBC, Peter Jennings at ABC, and Dan Rather at CBS. But the network news hegemony had been rattled by the arrival of CNN, and especially by its coverage of the 1990 Gulf War. Now Fox News and MSNBC\u2014both launched, coincidentally, within months of The Daily Show\u2019s 1996 debut\u2014were rapidly expanding their footprints on cable systems. Soon the Internet would flatten the traditional TV news industry. And a wised-up, postmodern generation of viewers was hungry for what The Daily Show would soon deliver. \n \n The turn of the century was also a boom time for network newsmagazines. NBC was airing Dateline five nights a week. ABC had 20/20 and Primetime; CBS had 48 Hours. Syndicated shows including Inside Edition added an even cheesier, tabloid flair to the genre. The TV-newsmagazine formula\u2014leaning heavily on sensationalized crime stories, breathless celebrity profiles, and consumer-product scares\u2014was ripe for parody. As were the self-serious anchor-reporter stars of TV newsmagazines: the style of The Daily Show\u2019s correspondents drew special inspiration from the overinflated gravitas of Dateline\u2019s Stone Phillips. \n \n MADELEINE SMITHBERG: I always say that Stone Phillips deserves a \u201ccreated by\u201d credit for The Daily Show, because I was obsessed with the guy, and we studied him. \n \n RORY ALBANESE (production assistant, later executive producer, 1999-2013): \n \n Colbert will tell you his character for years was just Stone Phillips. \n \n In the Kilborn era, field-department pieces frequently featured obscure eccentrics\u2014say, a man who pulled his own teeth and replaced them with driveway gravel. Those kinds of bits didn\u2019t go away immediately under Stewart. \n \n KAHANE CORN COOPERMAN (field producer, later co-executive producer, 1996-2015): \n \n I produced a field piece, with Stacey Grenrock Woods as the correspondent, about a guy, Alexander P., who had been a rock star in Ukraine and came here and was now a waiter in a hotel restaurant in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This piece may well have been in the works before Jon arrived. But it airs, and after the show you have a postmortem. And Jon was not happy. He said, \u201cYour targets are just wrong. They shouldn\u2019t be people on the fringe. Our targets need to be the people who have a voice, and that\u2019s politicians, and that\u2019s the media.\u201d \n \n STACEY GRENROCK WOODS (correspondent, 1998-2003): \n \n I heard Jon was very unhappy with that piece, and I don\u2019t blame him at all. I didn\u2019t like it, either, but it was given to me. I think it ended up being a policy-changing piece. \n \n STEVE CARELL: The correspondents had their own little thing going on with the field pieces. Jon left it up to us in terms of what sort of characters we were developing. \n \n I saw my character as a former local-news anchor who had been demoted to reporting on a nondescript cable news show and was a little bitter about it. Everyone to a certain degree had different variations on blowhard or idiot reporter. But I mean, let\u2019s face it\u2014we didn\u2019t know what we were doing. \n \n NANCY WALLS CARELL (correspondent, 1999-2002): \n \n No. \n \n STEVE CARELL: None of us are correspondents. None of us have backgrounds in journalism. \n \n NANCY WALLS CARELL: Mo was pretty knowledgeable, actually. \n \n STEPHEN COLBERT: There was a very specific way we were supposed to present ourselves when we set up field pieces: \u201cI\u2019m from The Daily Show.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s The Daily Show?\u201d \u201cWell, it\u2019s an alternative news-and-entertainment program.\u201d \u201cWhat channel is it on?\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what channel it is where you live. Where we live it\u2019s Channel 29.\u201d Anything other than saying the words \u201cComedy Central.\u201d We were never allowed to lie, but let\u2019s not advertise we were on Comedy Central, because not being a famous show was really useful to us in the early days. \n \n I was the first correspondent to be sued. After a piece ran, a guy claimed I claimed I was from CNN. I never said that. But if you make a man comedically look like Hitler and it turns out that he is a retired lawyer with a lot of time on his hands, you\u2019re going to get sued. That\u2019s the lesson for today, children. \n \n STEVE CARELL: The field pieces with eccentrics and oddballs, those were uncomfortable. For all of us. I almost didn\u2019t . . . I won\u2019t say I almost didn\u2019t do the show, but I had some major reservations about doing it for exactly that reason, because I didn\u2019t like the idea of making fun of people only because they were eccentric or different, and . . . \n \n NANCY WALLS CARELL: Duping them. \n \n STEVE CARELL: Yeah. Shooting fish in a barrel is easy. When you go after someone who is intolerant or racist or has any sort of hateful nature, that\u2019s a different story. I think that\u2019s fair game. So part of what I tried to do with my character is put the impetus on myself, the comedic impetus, that I was the bigger idiot. \n \n During his first year as host Stewart devoted far more energy to retooling the staff and the process inside the building. But it was the field department, in a series of excursions to New Hampshire to \u201ccover\u201d the presidential primaries, that really began pointing The Daily Show\u2019s tone and point of view in a new direction. Initially intimidated by the straight political media pack, correspondents Rocca, Walls Carell, DeGeneres, and Carell played jester. \n \n Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. \n \n STEVE CARELL: When we went up to the first Republican debate we had our jackets with \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d embroidered on them, and we\u2019re walking around with microphones. It was terrifying because people didn\u2019t know that we were fake. So we could get away with a lot of stuff. Bush looked at us like we were insane. \n \n CINDY McCAIN (wife of Senator John McCain): \n \n All of a sudden there were these guys in these crazy jackets, popping up at campaign events, and nobody knew who they were. But they were funny. \n \n STEW BAILEY (field producer, later co-executive producer, 1996-2005): \n \n There was a Republican debate in New Hampshire, so we were going to do a piece from the spin room. And the spin room even then was acknowledged as the least newsworthy event of all time. Our premise was that it\u2019s essentially a parlor game, and if that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s really turn it into a parlor game. I had each of the correspondents asking questions from Trivial Pursuit to the candidates. \n \n MO ROCCA: All of us were nervous as hell, and so I just went for it: \u201cSenator McCain, who became the hottest pop star to come out of Iceland in the mid-1990s?\u201d \n \n STEW BAILEY: Immediately our other correspondents start yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t skirt the question, Senator! You have to answer!\u201d \n \n MO ROCCA: And McCain showed why he almost upended George W. Bush in that race, because he played along, making this silly face. I remember the CNN people looking at us like, \u201cO.K., that was funny. But who are you guys?\u201d \n \n JON STEWART: When we went up to New Hampshire we were under the mistaken assumption that we had to integrate ourselves with the political media\u2019s process and become them to parody them. Turns out we didn\u2019t have to do that. We had thought, Oh, you\u2019re a political reporter on television, which must mean something. Turns out it doesn\u2019t mean anything. All it means is that somebody pointed a camera at you and lit it. So that was a revelation, and not a positive one. \n \n Then, in December 1999, came a breakthrough\u2014a five-minute segment that pushed past the silly and into the satirical. Carell climbed onto McCain\u2019s bus and changed the entire trajectory of The Daily Show. \n \n STEW BAILEY: Remember, McCain that year was a huge deal. He won the New Hampshire primary. That was really his moment. And his big gimmick was his bus, the Straight Talk Express. \n \n I was supervising in the field department. Our idea was that we were trying to get on the Straight Talk Express, but we couldn\u2019t. There was a secondary press bus. If you\u2019re in the rollover bus you just don\u2019t feel like you matter. So the premise was going to be: if Steve Carell finally does get on the Straight Talk Express, that means we were at the table with all the big important players. To get on McCain\u2019s bus was a coup for us; it meant that somebody was going to allow us to bring our reindeer games into a legitimate political moment. \n \n CINDY McCAIN: The actual press bus, which was completely different from ours, was really awful, in fact. Steve Carell was talking about, did we feed the press, or did we just lock them in the bus? They were pleading with me\u2014is there any way I can get them on the main bus? They were a hoot to be around, so John invited them on the Straight Talk Express. \n \n STEW BAILEY: We needed to then have Carell basically ask one question that is going to get us kicked off. The idea was going to be we had a brief moment of glory, we asked a question, and then we lost our privileges. \n \n STEVE CARELL:) [On board the Straight Talk Express, reading from a legal pad as McCain grins.] Let\u2019s do a lightning round: your favorite book? \n \n SENATOR JOHN McCAIN: For Whom the Bell Tolls. \n \n STEVE CARELL: Favorite movie? \n \n McCAIN: Viva Zapata! \n \n CARELL: Charlton Heston? \n \n McCAIN: Marlon Brando. \n \n CARELL: Close enough. If I were a tree, I would be a . . . \n \n McCAIN: If I were a tree, I would be a root. [Pause.] What does that mean? \n \n CARELL: Senator, how do you reconcile the fact that you were one of the most vocal critics of pork-barrel politics and yet while you were chairman of the Commerce Committee that committee set a record for unauthorized appropriations? [Four seconds of silence that feel like four hours.] I was just kidding! I don\u2019t even know what that means! [McCain looks at ceiling, shrugs in relief, awkwardly slaps hand to his own face. Carell shuffles sheepishly down the bus stairs and out the door, then stands on a highway median.] Oh, they all laughed at my little question. But two things were abundantly clear. It was the wrong question to ask, and I was going to be walking. \n \n STEW BAILEY: Carell and Nick McKinney, the producer, had pulled the question out of Time on the way there, driving to the shoot. Just the fact that Steve Carell can get those words out of his mouth and that it sounded like something a smart person would say really threw McCain off. There was such a delay. \n \n STEVE CARELL: It was really funny because all of McCain\u2019s handlers . . . you could feel the whole bus tense up. I thought McCain might just laugh it off, or probably give me some sort of joke response. \n \n BEN KARLIN: I remember seeing it in the editing room. I remember Jon called me down, and seeing it and thinking, Yeah, this is what we should be doing. This is the goal. It was one of Carell\u2019s most incredible moments. He asks McCain a question in a way that no journalists were talking to the candidates. And it was like, Oh shit, we are able, in this weird, unintentional way, to add a level of insight to the process that doesn\u2019t exist. That was really, really exciting. It meets the standard of being funny; it meets the standard of being relevant. \n \n JOHN McCAIN (U.S. senator, Arizona, 1987-; Republican presidential nominee, 2008): \n \n That was great. I still remember Steve Carell on the bus. I was certainly aware of Jon and the show early on, and knew they would try to have some fun with us. I wanted to be funny. I wanted these young people to know that I\u2019m a guy with a sense of humor. I\u2019m not some dull, dry, old senator. \n \n BEN KARLIN: That moment, it was the beauty and the weakness of The Daily Show. You had this incredibly pregnant moment where you forced a politician to go off-book, and it was uncomfortable, and it was honest. Then, because of our role as a comedy show, you have to take the air out of it, and it let McCain off the hook. \n \n STEVE CARELL: Yeah, to press it\u2014we really hadn\u2019t set ourselves up in that context to start going after him. It was making fun of a gotcha moment. And I think that a lot of what we do on The Daily Show is making fun of journalistic tropes, and I think that was one of them. \n \n MO ROCCA: That was the first time we were in The New York Times\u2014in a news-analysis piece, not the TV column. \n \n JON STEWART: The real revelation for the show, covering the 2000 campaign, was that before everything that happens publicly in politics there\u2019s a meeting\u2014so what\u2019s that meeting? That\u2019s what\u2019s interesting. It always struck me as \u201cWe\u2019re always covering the wrong thing. We\u2019re always covering the appearance, but we\u2019re never covering that meeting.\u201d When you watch that pack of cameras follow a presidential candidate, you go, \u201cThat\u2019s not interesting. What\u2019s interesting is to stand behind them and watch that,\u201d because then you learn a little bit about the process. \n \n That\u2019s when the idea of deconstructing the process came to the fore of how we were going to make the show. Before, it was just . . . we were making jokes. Some of them were insightful; some of them were not. The show came to exist in the space between what they\u2019re telling you in public and the meeting that they had where they decided to do it that way. Seeing that was the aha of \u201cThat\u2019s the show.\u201d \n \n CINDY McCAIN: I still have those jackets, by the way. I talked them out of their big New Hampshire jackets. They were around John so much, and I finally said, \u201cLook, these jackets are too good. I\u2019ve got to get one from you, please.\u201d They gave them to me. It\u2019s a great souvenir. \n \n Adapted from The Daily Show (The Book): An Oral History as Told by Jon Stewart, the Correspondents, Staff and Guests, by Chris Smith, with a foreword by Jon Stewart, to be published this month by Grand Central Publishing; \u00a9 2016 by Busboy Productions.",

The article is a fascinating oral history of the show's beginning that includes interviews with Stewart, Carell, Stephen Colbert, and pretty much everyone involved. The first year was rough for Stewart as he fought with the holdover writing staff from previous host Craig Kilborn and sought to put his stamp on the show. Things came together in that Carell interview, in which he peppers McCain with softball questions, then springs a policy zinger. After a few seconds of awkward silence, Carell says, \"I was just kidding! I don\u2019t even know what that means!\" And the tense moment subsides. (See the clip.)

Only a miracle can save them,\" he was quoted by The Siberian Times as saying. \n \n The paper said that a doctor and a kindergarten teacher are among the victims and that many of those who died were discovered in their homes because they did not have sufficient time to call an ambulance. \n \n Most of the victims are reported to be aged between 35 and 50. \n \n One 33-year-old survivor said that he only drank a small amount of the lotion but still woke up blind the following morning. \n \n Household products are seen by some as a cheap alternative to alcohol across the former Soviet Union. \n \n Bottles with the lotion normally carry warnings stating they are not to be consumed, but correspondents say that the labels in this case said that the product contained ethyl alcohol rather than deadly methanol. \n \n Analysts say up to 12 million Russians drink cheap surrogate alcohol, including perfume, after shave, anti-freeze and window cleaner. Two years of Western economic sanctions have made the situation worse. \n \n Police earlier uncovered an illicit workshop where the lotion was being made, and arrested its owners. ||||| Nearly 50 people died recently in a Siberian city after they drank bath oil as a substitute for alcohol. But why was the substance so deadly? \n \n Authorities in Irkutsk, the sixth-largest city in Russia, declared a state of emergency today (Dec. 19) after at least 49 people died from drinking the apparently mislabeled bath oil, according to the Washington Post. Another 15 people were hospitalized and are in critical condition. \n \n The label on the bath oil said it contained ethanol, and people drank the product as a cheap alternative to alcohol, which is a common practice in Russia, the Post reported. However, authorities said that the bath oil product actually contained methanol \u2014 which is a chemical in antifreeze. \n \n Methanol is harmful because of what happens when the body breaks it down. When people consume methanol, the body metabolizes it first into formaldehyde, and then into a compound called formic acid, which is highly toxic to cells, according to the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology. The breakdown of formic acid is slow, and so it can accumulate in the body. \n \n Methanol poisoning can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, breathing problems, dizziness, blindness and coma, according to the National Institutes of Health. As little as 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of methanol can kill a person, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [7 Ways Alcohol Affects Your Health] \n \n There are antidotes to reverse the effects of methanol, including fomepizole or ethanol, the NIH said on its website. But whether a person recovers after ingesting methanol depends on how much the individual swallowed and how soon he or she received medical care, the NIH said. In people who survive, blindness is common, the agency said. \n \n A minute level of methanol is found in most alcoholic drinks, and such levels are safe. But if alcohol is not properly distilled, methanol levels can be dangerously high, according to a report on a case of methanol poisoning that the CDC issued earlier this year. \n \n Methanol is colorless and smells like alcohol, and it is sometimes deliberately added to illegal alcohol drinks in order to strengthen them or make them stretch further, according to the National Health Service in the United Kingdom. \n \n Police in Irkutsk said that they have found a workshop where the bath oil was being made, along with bootleg vodka, according to Reuters. Officials have confiscated about 500 liters of bath oil and other liquid from stores in the area. \n \n Original article on Live Science.",

The concoction that caused the deaths was a black-market mixture promoted as a safe, hawthorn-scented alcoholic beverage, with a label that said it contained ethyl alcohol, which is OK to consume. However, it actually was made with methanol, which Live Science notes is a harmful chemical used in antifreeze that (besides death) can also cause a slew of other medical problems, including blindness. A market worker tells Reuters she usually uses the oil to remove grease and remnants of old price tags still stuck on surfaces. The BBC\u2014which notes millions of cash-strapped people in Russia often resort to drinking cheap \"surrogate\" booze, including perfume and window cleaner\u2014says the owners of the shop where the bath oil was made have been arrested.

It can\u2019t be that the conservative base just isn\u2019t happy with Romney. It can\u2019t be any of that. No, no, no,\u201d he said, according to a transcript of the show. \n \n Proceeding to confess the \u201cprofound respect and administration\u201d he has for the people who listen to his show, Limbaugh said the assumption that conservative voters are \u201ca bunch of idiots\u201d that can\u2019t make up their own minds was \u201cinsulting\u201d and \u201cdemeaning.\u201d \n \n He also warned the Republican Party that it would be making a serious mistake to assume that voters that opt for a non-Mitt Romney candidate do so simply under Limbaugh\u2019s orders. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re doing it because they genuinely have a problem with Romney. And they\u2019re doing it because in Santorum\u2019s case, as I\u2019ve been saying the past couple of weeks, if you\u2019re looking for a conservative who is the least corrupted, who has the least number of periods of wandering off the reservation, if you\u2019re looking for a conservative who\u2019s never sat down with Nancy Pelosi on the couch for any reason, you get Rick Santorum,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people know this.\u201d \n \n Limbaugh, who has vowed against making an endorsement to avoid losing credibility if the person he backs doesn\u2019t secure the party\u2019s nomination, had some wondering whether his secret pick in the GOP race was Santorum after he declared before the Florida primary, \u201cEverybody is guilty of some transgression somewhere against conservatism, except Santorum.\u201d \n \n And on his show on Wednesday, Limbaugh insisted that Santorum\u2019s win was hardly a surprise. \n \n \u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t surprised by this! I\u2019m not surprised by this. It\u2019s one of the reasons that I haven\u2019t been panicking throughout all of this. I think I have a pretty good understanding and idea where the Republican base is. If they\u2019re given the opportunity to vote for what they think so important, they\u2019ll do it,\u201d he said. ||||| (Image Credit: Jeff Roberson/AP) \n \n MCKINNEY, Texas - After stunning victories in Missouri, Minnesota and Colorado Tuesday night, GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum told a group of pastors here today that despite his focus on \"the role of family in our society,\" he is not running to be \"pastor in chief\" and that clergy should be working harder. \n \n \"It's not because I want to be the pastor of the United States,\" he said. \"I have no intention and no desire to be the pastor of this country. There are pastors all over here who, you know, you guys can do a little better than you're doing right now, I'll be honest with you,\" Santorum said before asking for an \"Amen\" from the crowd. \n \n \"We could be doing a little better out there in the churches, but I'm leaving that to you, all right? But that doesn't mean I'm not going to stand and fight for the things that are consistent with what this country was founded upon, which was a moral foundation,\" Santorum said. \n \n He briefly mentioned his victories Tuesday night, saying he consistently benefits from being underestimated. He beat Mitt Romney 2-1 in Missouri, which awarded no delegates. \n \n \"I got elected to the United States Congress. After these elections, I looked back and I just had to thank God, because there's no way I should have won this election,\" the former Pennsylvania senator said. \"One of the great gifts that I've had in my political career is that no one ever thinks that I could ever win anything. The gift of being underestimated is a wonderful gift. I think you may have seen a little bit of that last night.\" \n \n The owner of the event space - the Bella Donna chapel - a Santorum supporter, started inviting pastors from the Dallas area about a week ago to hear the former congressman speak. \n \n About 100 clergy packed into the small chapel, while an overflow tent next door was open to the public and held several hundred despite the cold temperatures. \n \n Santorum, 53, greeted the crowd and on his way out told a mass of reporters trailing him that his campaign had raised $400,000 in the past two days. \n \n The main reason for traveling to Texas, despite no upcoming primary, is for the candidate to attend a fundraiser in the Dallas area. An aide Tuesday evening told ABC News the state is \"very generous,\" and donors here were excited to meet him. \n \n The address was notably devoid of much political discussion, although he did accuse President Obama of restricting Americans' right to freedom of religion, as he has since the Department of Health and Human Services controversial decision last week to require all institutions that provide health insurance, including Catholic hospitals and universities, to cover contraception and emergency contraception. \n \n \"We even see the Obama administration right now not talking about freedom of religion,\" Santorum said. \"They now start using the term freedom of worship, which, how many people think all that religion is all about is worship? It's what you're about every single day. It's not just the freedom to gather and worship, but it's the freedom to go out and live that faith every day.\" \n \n As he usually does when addressing churches and religious groups, he spoke about his personal testimonial and religious awakening, telling the group he \"didn't realize how dry and parched\" he was when he first came to Congress and began attending bible study groups. \n \n He told the story of the son he lost a few hours after birth in 1996 named Gabriel and spoke about his 3-year-old daughter, Bella, who suffers from the rare, genetic condition, Trisomy 18. \n \n Santorum and members of the audience were clearly emotional and the crowd was rapt, hanging on to every word. \n \n Bella was admitted to the hospital two weeks ago with a grave case of double pneumonia. She was released a few days ago and the group today presented Santorum with a painting of his daughter with angel wings that will hang in the chapel, a space made to look like a Roman church. \n \n He also brought up how he got involved in work to restrict abortion rights and when he first entered the Senate it was not an issue he was particularly passionate about, especially because it was a risky political move. \n \n \"You can be the most conservative person ever. You can even vote pro-life,\" Santorum said. \"You can vote against everything, you can vote for no government, and you're fine. But once you speak out on the moral issues, you now have your head above and out of the trench and you are going to be shot at. \n \n \"And that's why most members of Congress won't talk about it. They'll vote that way, but they will not go out and talk about this issue. Unless it's in front of a pro-life group, and then the press gives you a pass. But to actually do anything, then you were a theocrat, you were the pastor in chief. You are this radical that wants to try to force your views on everybody else and try to moralize everybody, when all you're doing is standing up for the dignity of every human life. But that doesn't matter. It's one thing to vote that way, but it's another thing to get out and talk about those issues.\" \n \n He also addressed the California Proposition 8 ruling for the first time, which found the state's ban on same sex marriage unconstitutional. \n \n He said the decision read as though anyone who opposes same-sex marriage is \"bigot.\" \n \n \"Where's the tolerance in that?\" Santorum asked, calling the decision the \"intolerance of the left.\" \n \n \"They want their world view and if you question them, you're haters, bigots,\" Santorum said. \n \n At the end, the group surrounded the candidate, extended their hands and began praying for his health, safety and candidacy.",

It defines infertility as the inability to impregnate another person, the inability to carry a pregnancy to live birth or the inability to conceive after one or two years of unprotected sex, depending on the woman\u2019s age. \n \n That language, Ms. Cretcher said, violates the constitutional rights of nonheterosexual women. \n \n In a complaint filed last week, the plaintiffs, all lesbians trying to conceive, also sought damages for the cost of their treatments, including artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization. \n \n Ms. Cretcher\u2019s firm, Beranbaum Menken, is bringing the suit against Richard J. Badolato, commissioner of the Department of Banking and Insurance, who oversees the administration of all insurance-related state statutes. The agency declined to comment on the litigation. \n \n Fifteen states, including New Jersey, require insurance companies to cover fertility treatment. California and Maryland have updated the language in their mandates to require fertility coverage regardless of sexual orientation. \n \n \u201cThe specific wording of the New Jersey mandate is particularly egregious and one of the most specific and exclusionary,\u201d Ms. Cretcher said. \n \n The New Jersey Legislature has two bills that propose changing the definition of infertility to include a \u201cdetermination of infertility by a physician.\u201d Neither bill has emerged from committee. \n \n Dr. William Ziegler, the medical director of the Reproductive Science Center of New Jersey, said the issue of insurance coverage had long weighed on the field of fertility treatment. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not sure if there was a lot of thought given to the implications of what this would cause and how many New Jerseyans it would exclude,\u201d Dr. Ziegler said of the mandate. \u201cIt\u2019s a double standard. It discriminates against same-sex couples because they don\u2019t have the biological equipment to have a baby the way a heterosexual couple does.\u201d \n \n He said insurance played a big role in the type of treatment his patients were able to undergo. \n \n \u201cEven though I may recommend a specific treatment, if they just can\u2019t afford it they have to do something suboptimal, which may not get them to what they want: a healthy pregnancy,\u201d he said. \n \n Another plaintiff in the case, Sarah Mills, said she was worried about raising a child with debt from unsuccessful fertility treatments. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s really affected me emotionally,\u201d said Ms. Mills, 32, an elementary school teacher from Union City, N.J. \u201cI know it puts a strain on our relationship,\u201d she said, referring to her partner, Gloria Torres. \u201cI am so intense about this. I just worry every day that I can\u2019t get pregnant and about going into debt.\u201d \n \n Ms. Mills\u2019s insurance company, also Horizon, denied her coverage. She used credit cards to pay for her failed cycles of artificial insemination and anticipates taking out a loan. \u201cI don\u2019t know if we are going to have to stop eventually because we are paying out of pocket,\u201d she said. \n \n Horizon said in a statement that it covered \u201cinfertility services equally, regardless of sexual orientation,\u201d and that it interpreted the law \u201cin a gender- and orientation-neutral manner and our coverage standard complies with federal nondiscrimination requirements.\u201d \n \n After Erin Krupa was denied coverage by Horizon, she appealed the claim and began paying out of pocket for artificial insemination \u2014 $6,000 for three cycles. Each was unsuccessful. Her appeal was then denied. \n \n \u201cThere is a part of me that has always followed the rules and says this is the world we live in,\u201d Ms. Krupa, now 36, said. \u201cI didn\u2019t question it at the time. I just wanted to have a family.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The couple decided to try in vitro fertilization, which is more invasive and expensive \u2014 about $11,000 before the cost of sperm and medicine \u2014 but has a higher rate of success. \n \n On Christmas Eve, Ms. Krupa learned she was pregnant, and the couple drove to North Carolina to celebrate the holiday and the good news with family. But the pregnancy was ectopic, a condition in which a fertilized egg implants itself outside the uterus, and had to be terminated with two doses of chemotherapy. Ms. Krupa ended up in the hospital after a complication. \n \n After those painful events, her doctor \u201chad a lot of ammunition,\u201d she said, and wrote a letter to the insurance company. Horizon decided to provide coverage. \n \n The Krupas were allowed four cycles of in vitro fertilization. After the first three were unsuccessful, they changed their strategy: They would use Erin\u2019s embryos, but try to have Marianne carry them and have her go through the fourth cycle of in vitro fertilization. \n \n Marianne Krupa, 34, was able to use the last of the insurance money allotted to her wife.

After $50,000 in fertility treatments, a half dozen miscarriages, four for Erin and two for Marianne, their five-year quest for motherhood now involves a new course of action...legal action.Last week they filed a suit against the State of New Jersey. Why? They say state law allows insurance coverage for fertility treatments for heterosexual couples, but not for lesbian couples.\"Right away, we were told that without having sexual intercourse, we would not be covered,\" Marianne said.\"We have a medical diagnosis of infertility, and we were denied the medical treatments any heterosexual couple would have if they walked into a fertility clinic,\" added Erin.Reproductive Endocrinologist Dr. Jane Miller says the Krupa's case is not unique. She agrees with them, and says the law has to change.\"It's completely discriminatory. It gets us furious every time, because good people come in, and they say we just wanted to have a family and get on with our lives, and do what we have to do,\" Dr. Miller says.The Krupa's lawsuit targets the head of the state's Department of Banking and Insurance.

Little did they know they were about to hit upon a state insurance mandate from 2001 that they say specifically discriminates against same-sex couples trying to conceive: In New Jersey, most women under 35 must prove infertility by having had \"two years of unprotected sexual intercourse\" before their insurance providers are required to cover fertility treatments, reports the New York Times. Soon after they visited fertility doctors, Erin learned in 2013 that she is infertile due to endometriosis and benign cysts on her uterus. But their insurance provider has denied coverage of most treatments the couple has gone through, which means they've spent nearly $50,000 so far in their quest to have a child. Now they're suing the state. \"It's completely discriminatory,\" reproductive endocrinologist Dr. Jane Miller tells WABC-TV. And while only two other women are joining the Krupas in the lawsuit, Shannon Minter of the National Center for Lesbian Rights tells the New Jersey Law Journal that \"these denials are extremely common\" and \"we expect to see many more [legal challenges].\" One of the plaintiffs' attorneys says that the law in New Jersey is especially discriminatory in its language about exposure to sperm through intercourse. New York and Connecticut, for instance, require exposure but don't specify how, while legislation in California and Maryland requires infertility treatment be covered regardless of sexual orientation. As for the Krupas, Marianne has since gone through her own fertility treatments, but has miscarried twice. Both women are still trying. (These two common surgeries may make women more fertile.)",

    "document": "The Justice Department and the FBI have launched a review of thousands of criminal cases to determine whether any defendants were wrongly convicted or deserve a new trial because of flawed forensic evidence, officials said Tuesday. \n \n The undertaking is the largest post-conviction review ever done by the FBI. It will include cases conducted by all FBI Laboratory hair and fiber examiners since at least 1985 and may reach earlier if records are available, people familiar with the process said. Such FBI examinations have taken place in federal and local cases across the country, often in violent crimes, such as rape, murder and robbery. \n \n The review comes after The Washington Post reported in April that Justice Department officials had known for years that flawed forensic work might have led to the convictions of potentially innocent people but had not performed a thorough review of the cases. In addition, prosecutors did not notify defendants or their attorneys even in many cases they knew were troubled. \n \n On Tuesday, the Justice Department announced that it will conduct the more expansive review. \n \n \u201cThe Department and the FBI are in the process of identifying historical cases for review where a microscopic hair examination conducted by the FBI was among the evidence in a case that resulted in a conviction,\u201d spokeswoman Nanda Chitre said in a statement. \u201cWe have dedicated considerable time and resources to addressing these issues, with the goal of reaching final determinations in the coming months.\u201d \n \n FBI spokeswoman Ann Todd deferred comment to the Justice Department. \n \n In its April report, The Post identified two District men convicted largely on the testimony of FBI hair analysts who wrongly placed them at crime scenes. Santae A. Tribble, now 51, was convicted of killing a taxi driver in 1978, and Kirk L. Odom, now 49, was convicted of a sexual assault in 1981. Since the Post report, Tribble\u2019s conviction was vacated, and on Tuesday, prosecutors moved to overturn Odom\u2019s conviction and declare him innocent. The Justice Department had not previously reviewed their cases. \n \n Chitre said the new review would include help from the Innocence Project, a New York-based advocacy group for people seeking exoneration through DNA testing. It also would include the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. \n \n Steven D. Benjamin, a Richmond lawyer who is incoming president of the association, called the review \u201can important collaboration\u201d and a departure from one-sided government reviews that left defendants in the dark. \n \n \u201cMistakes were made. What is important now is our working together to correct those mistakes,\u201d Benjamin said, adding that his organization will \u201cfully assist in finding and notifying all those who may have been affected.\u201d \n \n The review comes as the National Academy of Sciences is urging the White House and Congress to remove crime labs from police and prosecutors\u2019 control, or at least to strengthen the science and standards underpinning the nation\u2019s forensic science system. \n \n The last time the FBI abandoned a forensic practice was in 2005, when it ended efforts to trace bullets to a specific manufacturer\u2019s batch through analyzing their chemical composition after its methodology was scientifically debunked. The bureau released files in an estimated 2,500 bullet-lead cases only after \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and The Post reported the problem in 2007. \n \n Michael R. Bromwich, a former Justice Department official who investigated the FBI Laboratory in the mid-1990s as inspector general and, more recently, the city of Houston\u2019s crime lab, said the review is important as the nation\u2019s crime labs come under scrutiny. \n \n \u201cThese recent developments remind us of the profound questions about the validity of many forensic techniques that have been used over the course of many decades and underscore the need for continuing attention at every level to ensuring the scientific validity and accuracy of the forensic science that is used every day in our criminal justice system,\u201d Bromwich said. \n \n The Post reported in April that hair and fiber analysis was subjective and lacked grounding in solid research and that the FBI lab lacked protocols to ensure that agent testimony was scientifically accurate. But bureau managers kept their reviews limited to one agent, even as they learned that many examiners\u2019 \u201cmatches\u201d were often wrong and that numerous examiners overstated the significance of matches, using bogus statistics or exaggerated claims. \n \n Details of how the new FBI review will be conducted remain unclear. The exact number of cases that will be reviewed is unknown. The FBI is starting with more than 10,000 cases referred to all hair and fiber examiners. From those, the focus will be on a smaller number of hair examinations that resulted in positive findings and a conviction. \n \n It also is unclear whether the review will focus only on exaggerated testimony by FBI examiners or also on scientifically unfounded statements made by others trained by the FBI, or made by prosecutors. Also unclear is at what point government officials will notify defense attorneys or the Innocence Project. \n \n In past reviews, the department kept results secret and gave findings only to prosecutors, who then determined whether to turn them over to the defense. ||||| The Justice Department and FBI have formally acknowledged that nearly every examiner in an elite FBI forensic unit gave flawed testimony in almost all trials in which they offered evidence against criminal defendants over more than a two-decade period before 2000. \n \n Of 28 examiners with the FBI Laboratory\u2019s microscopic hair comparison unit, 26 overstated forensic matches in ways that favored prosecutors in more than 95 percent of the 268 trials reviewed so far, according to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) and the Innocence Project, which are assisting the government with the country\u2019s largest post-conviction review of questioned forensic evidence. \n \n The cases include those of 32 defendants sentenced to death. Of those, 14 have been executed or died in prison, the groups said under an agreement with the government to release results after the review of the first 200 convictions. \n \n The FBI errors alone do not mean there was not other evidence of a convict\u2019s guilt. Defendants and federal and state prosecutors in 46 states and the District are being notified to determine whether there are grounds for appeals. Four defendants were previously exonerated. \n \n The admissions mark a watershed in one of the country\u2019s largest forensic scandals, highlighting the failure of the nation\u2019s courts for decades to keep bogus scientific information from juries, legal analysts said. The question now, they said, is how state authorities and the courts will respond to findings that confirm long-suspected problems with subjective, pattern-based forensic techniques \u2014 like hair and bite-mark comparisons \u2014 that have contributed to wrongful convictions in more than one-quarter of 329 DNA-exoneration cases since 1989. \n \n \n \n \n \n In a statement, the FBI and Justice Department vowed to continue to devote resources to address all cases and said they \u201care committed to ensuring that affected defendants are notified of past errors and that justice is done in every instance. The Department and the FBI are also committed to ensuring the accuracy of future hair analysis testimony, as well as the application of all disciplines of forensic science.\u201d \n \n Peter Neufeld, co-founder of the Innocence Project, commended the FBI and department for the collaboration but said, \u201cThe FBI\u2019s three-decade use of microscopic hair analysis to incriminate defendants was a complete disaster.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe need an exhaustive investigation that looks at how the FBI, state governments that relied on examiners trained by the FBI and the courts allowed this to happen and why it wasn\u2019t stopped much sooner,\u201d Neufeld said. \n \n Norman L. Reimer, the NACDL\u2019s executive director, said, \u201cHopefully, this project establishes a precedent so that in future situations it will not take years to remediate the injustice.\u201d \n \n While unnamed federal officials previously acknowledged widespread problems, the FBI until now has withheld comment because findings might not be representative. \n \n Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a former prosecutor, called on the FBI and Justice Department to notify defendants in all 2,500 targeted cases involving an FBI hair match about the problem even if their case has not been completed, and to redouble efforts in the three-year-old review to retrieve information on each case. \n \n \u201cThese findings are appalling and chilling in their indictment of our criminal justice system, not only for potentially innocent defendants who have been wrongly imprisoned and even executed, but for prosecutors who have relied on fabricated and false evidence despite their intentions to faithfully enforce the law,\u201d Blumenthal said. \n \n Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and the panel\u2019s ranking Democrat, Patrick J. Leahy (Vt.), urged the bureau to conduct \u201ca root-cause analysis\u201d to prevent future breakdowns. \n \n \u201cIt is critical that the Bureau identify and address the systemic factors that allowed this far-reaching problem to occur and continue for more than a decade,\u201d the lawmakers wrote FBI Director James B. Comey on March 27, as findings were being finalized. \n \n The FBI is waiting to complete all reviews to assess causes but has acknowledged that hair examiners until 2012 lacked written standards defining scientifically appropriate and erroneous ways to explain results in court. The bureau expects this year to complete similar standards for testimony and lab reports for 19 forensic disciplines. \n \n Federal authorities launched the investigation in 2012 after The Washington Post reported that flawed forensic hair matches might have led to the convictions of hundreds of potentially innocent people since at least the 1970s, typically for murder, rape and other violent crimes nationwide. \n \n The review confirmed that FBI experts systematically testified to the near-certainty of \u201cmatches\u201d of crime-scene hairs to defendants, backing their claims by citing incomplete or misleading statistics drawn from their case work. \n \n In reality, there is no accepted research on how often hair from different people may appear the same. Since 2000, the lab has used visual hair comparison to rule out someone as a possible source of hair or in combination with more accurate DNA testing. \n \n Warnings about the problem have been mounting. In 2002, the FBI reported that its own DNA testing found that examiners reported false hair matches more than 11 percent of the time. In the District, the only jurisdiction where defenders and prosecutors have re-investigated all FBI hair convictions, three of seven defendants whose trials included flawed FBI testimony have been exonerated through DNA testing since 2009, and courts have exonerated two more men. All five served 20 to 30 years in prison for rape or murder. \n \n University of Virginia law professor Brandon L. Garrett said the results reveal a \u201cmass disaster\u201d inside the criminal justice system, one that it has been unable to self-correct because courts rely on outdated precedents admitting scientifically invalid testimony at trial and, under the legal doctrine of finality, make it difficult for convicts to challenge old evidence. \n \n \u201cThe tools don\u2019t exist to handle systematic errors in our criminal justice system,\u201d Garrett said. \u201cThe FBI deserves every recognition for doing something really remarkable here. The problem is there may be few judges, prosecutors or defense lawyers who are able or willing to do anything about it.\u201d \n \n Federal authorities are offering new DNA testing in cases with errors, if sought by a judge or prosecutor, and agreeing to drop procedural objections to appeals in federal cases. \n \n However, biological evidence in the cases often is lost or unavailable. Among states, only California and Texas specifically allow appeals when experts recant or scientific advances undermine forensic evidence at trial. \n \n Defense attorneys say scientifically invalid forensic testimony should be considered as violations of due process, as courts have held with false or misleading testimony. \n \n The FBI searched more than 21,000 federal and state requests to its hair comparison unit from 1972 through 1999, identifying for review roughly 2,500 cases where examiners declared hair matches. \n \n Reviews of 342 defendants\u2019 convictions were completed as of early March, the NACDL and Innocence Project reported. In addition to the 268 trials in which FBI hair evidence was used against defendants, the review found cases in which defendants pleaded guilty, FBI examiners did not testify, did not assert a match or gave exculpatory testimony. \n \n When such cases are included, by the FBI\u2019s count examiners made statements exceeding the limits of science in about 90 percent of testimonies, including 34 death-penalty cases. \n \n The findings likely scratch the surface. The FBI said as of mid-April that reviews of about 350 trial testimonies and 900 lab reports are nearly complete, with about 1,200 cases remaining. \n \n The bureau said it is difficult to check cases before 1985, when files were computerized. It has been unable to review 700 cases because police or prosecutors did not respond to requests for information. \n \n Also, the same FBI examiners whose work is under review taught 500 to 1,000 state and local crime lab analysts to testify in the same ways. \n \n Texas, New York and North Carolina authorities are reviewing their hair examiner cases, with ad hoc efforts underway in about 15 other states. ||||| Cleveland Wright has asked a D.C.

(Alexandra Garcia/The Washington Post) \n \n Cleveland Wright has asked a D.C. Court judge to clear his name after new DNA test results in 2012 exonerated his co-defendant in two similar 1978 murders. (Alexandra Garcia/The Washington Post) \n \n Nearly every criminal case reviewed by the FBI and the Justice Department as part of a massive investigation started in 2012 of problems at the FBI lab has included flawed forensic testimony from the agency, government officials said. \n \n The findings troubled the bureau, and it stopped the review of convictions last August. Case reviews resumed this month at the order of the Justice Department, the officials said. \n \n U.S. officials began the inquiry after The Washington Post reported two years ago that flawed forensic evidence involving microscopic hair matches might have led to the convictions of hundreds of potentially innocent people. Most of those defendants never were told of the problems in their cases. \n \n The inquiry includes 2,600 convictions and 45 death-row cases from the 1980s and 1990s in which the FBI\u2019s hair and fiber unit reported a match to a crime-scene sample before DNA testing of hair became common. The FBI had reviewed about 160 cases before it stopped, officials said. \n \n (Related: \u2018Irreversible harm\u2019 when FBI didn\u2019t reveal flawed lab work in death-row cases) \n \n The investigation resumed after the Justice Department\u2019s inspector general excoriated the department and the FBI for unacceptable delays and inadequate investigation in a separate inquiry from the mid-1990s. The inspector general found in that probe that three defendants were executed and a fourth died on death row in the five years it took officials to reexamine 60 death-row convictions that were potentially tainted by agent misconduct, mostly involving the same FBI hair and fiber analysis unit now under scrutiny. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t know whether history is repeating itself, but clearly the [latest] report doesn\u2019t give anyone a sense of confidence that the work of the examiners whose conduct was first publicly questioned in 1997 was reviewed as diligently and promptly as it needed to be,\u201d said Michael R. Bromwich, who was inspector general from 1994 to 1999 and is now a partner at the Goodwin Procter law firm. \n \n Bromwich would not discuss any aspect of the current review because he is a pro bono adviser to the Innocence Project, which along with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers is assisting the government effort under an agreement not to talk about the review. Still, he added, \u201cNow we are left 18 years [later] with a very unhappy, unsatisfying and disquieting situation, which is far harder to remedy than if the problems had been addressed promptly.\u201d \n \n Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole this month ordered that reviews resume under the original terms, officials said. \n \n (Related: U.S. reviewing 27 death penalty convictions for FBI forensic testimony errors) \n \n According to the FBI, the delay resulted, in part, \u201cfrom a vigorous debate that occurred within the FBI and DOJ about the appropriate scientific standards we should apply when reviewing FBI lab examiner testimony \u2014 many years after the fact.\u201d \n \n \u201cWorking closely with DOJ, we have resolved those issues and are moving forward with the transcript review for the remaining cases,\u201d the FBI said. \n \n 1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Investigating flaws in forensics View Photos A Washington Post investigation reveals that Justice Department officials have known for years that flaws in forensic techniques and weak laboratory standards may have led to the convictions of innocent people across the country, raising the question: How many more are out there?

Tribble spent 28 years in prison based largely on analysis of hairs found at the scene of a taxi driver\u2019s murder in 1978. More advanced DNA testing showed that none of the hairs used as evidence shared Tribble\u2019s genetic profile. A judge has vacated his conviction and dismissed the underlying charges. Alexandra Garcia/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \n \n Emily Pierce, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said: \u201cThe Department of Justice never signed off on the FBI\u2019s decision to change the way they reviewed the hair analysis. We are pleased that the review has resumed and that notification letters will be going out in the next few weeks.\u201d \n \n During the review\u2019s 11-month hiatus, Florida\u2019s Supreme Court denied an appeal by a death-row inmate who challenged his 1988 conviction based on an FBI hair match. James Aren Duckett\u2019s results were caught up in the delay, and his legal options are now more limited. \n \n Revelations that the government\u2019s largest post-conviction review of forensic evidence has found widespread problems counter earlier FBI claims that a single rogue examiner was at fault. Instead, they feed a growing debate over how the U.S. justice system addresses systematic weaknesses in past forensic testimony and methods. \n \n \u201cI see this as a tip-of-the-iceberg problem,\u201d said Erin Murphy, a New York University law professor and expert on modern scientific evidence. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not as though this is one bad apple or even that this is one bad-apple discipline,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a long list of disciplines that have exhibited problems, where if you opened up cases you\u2019d see the same kinds of overstated claims and unfounded statements.\u201d \n \n Worries about the limitations and presentation of scientific evidence are \u201ccoming out of the dark shadows of the legal system,\u201d said David H. Kaye, a law professor at Penn State who helped lead a Justice Department-funded study of fingerprint analysis and testimony in 2012. \u201cThe question is: What can you do about it?\u201d \n \n Courts and law enforcement authorities have been reluctant to allow defendants to retroactively challenge old evidence using newer, more accurate scientific methods. \n \n The Justice Department and FBI inquiry, which examines convictions before 2000, could provide a way for defendants to make that challenge. Because the government is dropping procedural objections to appeals and offering new DNA testing in flawed cases if sought by a judge or prosecutor, results could provide a measure of the frequency of wrongful convictions. \n \n Responding to the FBI review, the accreditation arm of the American Society of Crime Lab Directors last year recommended that labs determine whether they needed to conduct similar reviews, and New York, North Carolina and Texas are doing so. \n \n According to a Justice Department spokesman, officials last August completed reviews and notified a first wave of defendants in 23 cases, including 14 death-penalty cases, that FBI examiners \u201cexceeded the limits of science\u201d when they linked hair to crime-scene evidence. \n \n However, concerned that errors were found in the \u201cvast majority\u201d of cases, the FBI restarted the review, grinding the process to a halt, said a government official who was briefed on the process. The Justice Department objected in January, but a standoff went unresolved until this month. \n \n After more than two years, the review will have addressed about 10 percent of the 2,600 questioned convictions and perhaps two-thirds of questioned death-row cases. \n \n The department is notifying defendants about errors in two more death-penalty cases and in 134 non-capital cases over the next month, and will complete evaluations of 98 other cases by early October, including 14 more death-penalty cases. \n \n No crime lab performed more hair examinations for federal and state agencies than the 10-member FBI unit, which testified in cases nationwide involving murder, rape and other violent felonies. \n \n Although FBI policy has stated since at least the 1970s that a hair association cannot be used as positive identification, like fingerprints, agents regularly testified to the near-certainty of matches. \n \n In reality, there is no accepted research on how often hair from different people may appear the same. The FBI now uses visual hair comparison to rule out someone as a possible source of hair or as a screening step before more accurate DNA testing. \n \n This month, the inspector general reported that inattention and foot-dragging by the Justice Department and the FBI led them to ignore warnings 15 years ago that scientifically unsupported and misleading testimony could have come from more than a single hair examiner among agents discredited in a 1997 inspector general\u2019s report on misconduct at the FBI lab. \n \n The report said that as of 1999, Justice Department officials had enough information to review all hair unit cases \u2014 not just those of former agent Michael P. Malone, who was identified as the agent making the most frequent exaggerated testimony. \n \n By 2002, Maureen Killion, then director of enforcement operations, had alerted senior criminal division officials to \u201cthe specter that the other examiners in the unit\u201d were as sloppy as Malone, the inspector general said. \n \n \u201cThis issue has been raised with the FBI but not resolved to date,\u201d Killion wrote to then-Assistant Attorney General Michael Chertoff and his principal deputy, John C. Keeney, in July 2002, the report said. \n \n Twelve years later, the Florida case shows the continued inadequacy of officials\u2019 response. \n \n Duckett, then a rookie police officer in Mascotte, Fla., was convicted of raping and strangling Teresa McAbee, 11, and dumping her into a lake in 1987. \n \n After a state police examiner was unable to match pubic hair found in the victim\u2019s underwear, prosecutors went to Malone, who testified at trial that there was a \u201chigh degree of probability\u201d that the hair came from Duckett. \n \n Such testimony is scientifically invalid, according to the parameters of the current FBI review, because it claims to associate a hair with a single person \u201cto the exclusion of all others.\u201d \n \n The Florida court denied Duckett\u2019s request for a new hearing on Malone\u2019s hair match. The court noted that there was other evidence of Duckett\u2019s guilt and that the FBI had not entirely abandoned visual hair comparison. \n \n Duckett attorney Mary Elizabeth Wells confirmed this week that Duckett\u2019s case was under the FBI\u2019s review. Both Wells and Whitney Ray, a spokeswoman for Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, said Thursday that parties had not been notified of results, but they otherwise declined to comment. \n \n Duckett\u2019s case was eligible for the 1996 review as a Malone case but was omitted, even though the inspector general stated that \u201cit was important to the integrity of the justice system\u201d that all of Malone\u2019s death-penalty cases be immediately reviewed. \n \n The Justice Department declined to comment on the omission. \n \n Get updates on your area delivered via e-mail",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Impressed when an FBI forensic expert testifies in court? Jurors likely are too, but the FBI's hair-comparison unit actually gave unscientific testimony against criminal defendants for more than 20 years before 2000, according to the FBI and the Justice Dept. Among the FBI's 28 microscopic hair experts, 26 \"overstated forensic matches\" to favor the prosecution in nearly all of the 268 cases reviewed so far, the Washington Post reports. \"The FBI\u2019s three-decade use of microscopic hair analysis to incriminate defendants was a complete disaster,\" says Peter Neufeld, who helped found the Innocence Project. The reviewed cases include 32 defendants given the death sentence, 14 of whom have already died in prison or were executed; about 2,500 cases involving hair matches are being looked at in all. Of course, other evidence may have sufficed to convict defendants found guilty. But the FBI, acknowledging the problem, has agreed to work with the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL) and the Innocence Project in reviewing cases between 1972 and 1999. Now 46 states and the District of Columbia are receiving information that could lead to appeals, if defense lawyers, prosecutors, or judges are willing or able. Truth is, there's no scientific standard for matching hair, the Post says. Worse, the forensic-hair scandal is only part of an ongoing review of all criminal forensics, which the Post has reported on here, here, and here. \"The forensic science system ... has serious problems that can only be addressed by a national commitment to overhaul the current structure,\" a science panel concluded back in 2009.",

    "document": "Military members, retirees and veterans have a few more reasons to be wary of politicians who say their top priority is to cut federal spending. \n \n The Congressional Budget Office on Wednesday released a report of more than 100 options for reducing budget deficits. It's a timely product as House and Senate conferees strive to negotiate by mid-December a new debt-cutting deal to replace automatic budget cuts of sequestration. \n \n More than a few of the CBO options are fresh ideas to roll back compensation for categories of veterans or to raise TRICARE fees for military retirees, on suggestions that the government is being too generous. \n \n To be fair, CBO is not singling out veterans here. There are options in the report to make nervous many segments of society dependent on federal payments, from social security recipients to drug manufacturers. \n \n But for select veterans' programs, CBO makes some hard-edged points that lawmakers bent on cutting spending might find compelling, if not persuasive, to help address the nation's debt crisis. \n \n Here are some of those ideas: \n \n Cap Military Pay Raises \u2013 From 2000 through 2010, Congress approved basic pay raises that averaged a half percentage point above private sector wage growth. The military could save $25 billion from 2015 to 2023 by reversing course, capping raises yearly at .5 percent below civilian wage growth. CBO predicts only a \"minor\" effect on force retention. \n \n Evidence in favor of this move are data showing cash compensation for enlisted members now exceeds wages of 90 percent of civilian counterparts, well above the Defense Department's goal of keeping service pay ahead of 70 percent of civilians of similar age and educational background. CBO says officer compensation exceeds 86 percent of private sector peers. \n \n The case against capping raises is that recruiting and retention goals could be compromised, CBO says, and smaller raises also dampen other elements of military compensation including retirement annuities. \n \n Raise TRICARE Fees \u2013 CBO floats two options to have military retirees pay more for health care. One is to have TRICARE-for-Life users -- retirees, spouses and survivors age 65 and older -- pay the first $550 of costs not covered by Medicare and then 50 percent of the next $4950. CBO says this would slow TRICARE costs by $31 billion from 2015 to 2023 but also save Medicare dollars as older beneficiaries seek fewer health services. \n \n The drawback is some TLF users might not seek needed preventive care or manage their chronic conditions as closely as they do now. \n \n The second option targets \"working age\" retirees and families enrolled in TRICARE Prime by raising fees, deductibles and co-pays in a complex combination too detailed to describe here. The Prime changes for retirees could save from $2 billion to $11 billion by 2023, depending on final details. \n \n Concurrent Receipt \u2013 Until 2003, military retirees who drew tax-free compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for service-connected disabilities saw retired pay reduced by an equal amount. Congress phased out this ban on \"concurrent receipt\" over several years to for retirees with disability ratings of 50 percent or higher. As a result, last year 420,000 retirees received $7 billion in concurrent receipt payments. \n \n Lifting this ban, CBO suggests, encouraged many more retirees to seek a VA disability rating. In 2005, only 33 percent who served 20 or more years received VA disability pay. By 2012, that proportion of longevity retirees drawing disability pay had climbed to 45 percent. \n \n CBO says $108 billion could be saved from 2015 to 2023 if the ban on concurrent receipt were restored for current and future retirees. They \"would still receive higher after-tax payments than would retirees who are not disabled,\" CBO noted. \n \n The argument against is that retired pay and VA pay compensate for \"different characteristics of military service: rewarding longevity in the former case and remunerating for pain and suffering in the latter\u2026Moreover, some retirees would find the loss of income financially difficult.\" \n \n That CBO floated such an option could dampen hope among military retirees with disabilities rated 40 percent and less that Congress someday will lift the concurrent receipt ban for them too. \n \n Narrow Eligibility for VA Compensation \u2013 The law requires VA to define \"service-connected\" ailments broadly so if symptoms occur in service the condition usually is compensable. Last year, CBO says, VA paid 520,000 veterans a total of $2.9 billion \"for seven medical conditions that\u2026are generally neither caused nor aggravated by military service.\" \n \n VA could save $20 billion, from 2015 to 2023, if it stopped compensating veterans for the following: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; arteriosclerotic heart disease; hemorrhoids; uterine fibroids; multiple sclerosis; Crohn's disease and osteoarthritis. \n \n Indeed, if Congress eliminated \"compensation for all disabilities unrelated to military duties,\" CBO says, the savings would be far greater, though, admittedly, this \"would be more difficult to administer.\" \n \n The argument in support is that VA disability pay should be more comparable to civilian systems, which \"do not typically compensate individuals for all medical problems\" that develop during employment. \n \n The opposing argument is that military service \"imposes extraordinary risks\" and hardships, which justify current pays and benefits including compensation for those who become disabled in any way while in service. \n \n Tighten VA \"IU\" Benefits \u2013 VA will supplement regular disability compensation for veterans not rated 100-percent disabled if they are deemed \"unable to engage in substantial work,\" CBO explains. The \"Individual Unemployability\" (IU) benefit is paid today to 300,000 veterans, boosting monthly incomes by an average of $1800 a month. \n \n A third of IU veterans, however, are over 65, the age by which many American workers are retired and drawing full social security benefits. CBO said VA could save $15 billion by 2023 if it stopped IU to older veterans. \n \n These are not recommendations, CBO says, only options intended to inform lawmakers. \n \n To comment, write Military Update, P.O.

That charge was raised to first-degree premeditated murder after a grand jury indicted Allwine in March. \n \n Cottage Grove police arrested Allwine, 43, after a two-month investigation into the death of wife, Amy Allwine. \n \n Authorities responding to a 911 call from Stephen Allwine found Amy Allwine dead in her Cottage Grove home in November 2016. She was dead, with a gunshot wound to the head. \n \n A medical examination later revealed excessive doses of scopolamine, a drug used to treat nausea, in Amy Allwine\u2019s body. She did not have a prescription for that drug. \n \n Prosecutors allege Stephen Allwine accessed the \u201cdark web,\u201d a hidden portion of the internet associated with crime, to hire a hit man to kill his wife. After several plans fell through, prosecutors say, Stephen Allwine poisoned his wife and shot her with the family\u2019s 9mm gun. \n \n Defense attorney Kevin Devore said the timeline leading up to Amy Allwine\u2019s death would have made it impossible for Stephen Allwine to have killed her. \n \n The state, Devore said, built a case on \u201ctheories with gaps\u201d and used speculation to \u201cbridge those gaps.\u201d \n \n MARRIAGE COUNSELOR, MARITAL AFFAIRS \n \n Assistant Washington County Attorney Jamie Kreuser described Amy Allwine as a loving mother, dog lover, business owner and a woman of faith \u2014 not the type of person who would die by suicide. \n \n \u201cWho would want to do this?\u201d Kreuser said of the woman\u2019s alleged murder. \u201cSomeone who didn\u2019t want to be married to her anymore.\u201d \n \n Stephen Allwine wrote sermons and counseled married couples at a Newport Church where he served as a deacon and later a church elder. \n \n Through those capacities, Kreuser said, Stephen learned about Ashley Madison, a dating website catering to married people seeking affairs. \n \n Investigators, according to the criminal complaint, identified at least two women Stephen Allwine met through the website. \n \n Devore acknowledged Stephen Allwine\u2019s relationships with other women, but said having affairs doesn\u2019t mean he killed his wife \u201cor even didn\u2019t love his wife.\u201d \n \n Kreuser said Stephen Allwine\u2019s role as an elder and longtime congregant at the church could have kept him from divorcing his wife, despite wishes to end the marriage. \n \n Officials with the FBI had been in contact with the family since, about anonymous emails Amy Allwine received in July 2016 graphically threatening to harm her family if she did not commit suicide. \n \n Investigators who searched Stephen Allwine\u2019s computer, according to the complaint, found searches for the names of his wife\u2019s family members. \n \n The emails were sent through a Tor, or an anonymous router used to access the dark web. \n \n DARK WEB \n \n FBI officials contacted Cottage Grove police in early 2016 about someone accessing the dark web and soliciting Amy Allwine\u2019s murder under the username \u201cdogdaygod\u201d on \u201cBesa Mafia,\u201d a website associated with hired murders and assaults. \n \n The user, prosecutors say, provided Besa Mafia with Amy Allwine\u2019s description and whereabouts. \n \n The user discussed two possible attempts to kill Amy Allwine, neither of which transpired. \n \n Several months later, the same user inquired on a different dark web site about buying scopolamine, the drug found in Amy Allwines\u2019s body, using a virtual currency called bitcoin. \n \n In the search of the Allwine home following Amy Allwine\u2019s death, detectives found a document backup on Stephen Allwine\u2019s computer from his phone containing a bitcoin code, a sequence Kreuser said would have been \u201cvirtually impossible to replicate.\u201d \n \n Investigators found the same code posted to the Besa Mafia website by user \u201cdogdaygod.\u201d \n \n Devore questioned the credibility of the computer analyst who performed forensic examinations on Stephen Allwine\u2019s computers and said the investigation of the home had been \u201ccontaminated.\u201d \n \n Police officers, Devore said, removed the gun found near Amy Allwine\u2019s body to remove bullets and take photos before returning it to its original position. \n \n Related Articles Minneapolis man convicted of killing

affairs, didn't want to stay married and killed his wife in November 2016 to end their relationship. \n \n \"He was seeing other women but he didn't want to divorce her because of his position in the church,\" said Kreuser, referring to the defendant's role as an elder in the United Church of God. \n \n But defense attorney Kevin DeVore refuted those allegations, telling the jury that the affairs were \"red herrings and distractions\" and that the prosecution had no evidence Allwine committed a crime. \n \n \"Just because he had an affair doesn't mean he killed his wife,\" DeVore said, adding that evidence at the death scene was \"contaminated\" because police officers removed a 9-millimeter handgun to unload it before photographs were taken. \n \n Allwine, who is being held at the county jail, was charged with second-degree murder before a grand jury indicted him with first-degree premeditated murder in March. The penalty for a first-degree murder conviction is mandatory life in prison. \n \n Allwine \n \n In November 2016, police were summoned to the family's house on S. 110th Street in Cottage Grove after Stephen Allwine called 911 and told the dispatcher his wife had shot herself. A recording of the call, played in court, included the voice of the couple's 9-year-old son who was heard asking, \"Why did she do that?\" \n \n Allwine, an IT specialist who was then 43, replied, \"I don't know, bud, I don't know.\" \n \n As the courtroom audience listened to the recording, Allwine sat with his head down. \n \n The dispatcher who took that call, Victoria Herrmann, testified that Allwine's demeanor ranged \"from calm to hysterical\" before officers arrived at the house. \n \n \"He never asked if responders were en route,\" she said. \n \n Two Cottage Grove police officers found Amy Allwine, 43, on her back in the bedroom, a large pool of blood surrounding her head. She was the owner of Active Dog Sports Training, a business that closed after her death. \n \n 'Not a TV show' \n \n Kreuser, in her opening statement, told jurors that months before the death of his wife, Stephen Allwine was having affairs with women he had met through the Ashley Madison website, which he had learned about while counseling married couples at his church. He began exploring the dark web, the portion of the internet that search engines don't index. \n \n It was there that Allwine, using the nickname \"dogdaygod,\" looked for someone to kill his wife, Kreuser said. A website known as Besa Mafia, where people solicit murders and assaults for hire, bilked Allwine out of thousands of dollars, she said. \n \n So, Kreuser said, Allwine figured out an elaborate plot to disguise his wife's murder as a suicide, which included having their son leave the house that afternoon and then bringing him back to discover her body. \n \n Allwine drugged his wife and then shot her in the right ear, Kreuser said. He dragged her body from the hallway into the bedroom to stage a suicide, Kreuser said; police found the gun resting on her left forearm. \n \n Investigators, using a special chemical, found a large bloodstain in the hallway that had been wiped away, she said. \n \n When DeVore took his turn speaking to the jury, he said the prosecution lacked \"traditional evidence\" of a crime. Prosecutors would instead try to sway the jury through the findings of a forensic computer analyst, he said. \n \n \"It sounds like an amazing story, but it's not a TV show or a movie but real life,\" DeVore said. The prosecution would try to convict Allwine with theories, he said, but \"that's not good enough in this courtroom.\" \n \n Amy Allwine had gunshot residue on her hands, he said, and police ruined the shooting scene when an officer removed the weapon to unload it. An officer put it back on her body before crime photos were taken. Two police officers who testified Tuesday said no photos were taken beforehand. \n \n DeVore also said witnesses saw two cars accelerating rapidly and leaving the neighborhood before Stephen Allwine reported his wife dead. That happened when Allwine had gone to Woodbury to get his son from his father-in-law's house, DeVore said. \n \n Allwine and the boy entered the house together and the boy saw his mother's body. \n \n The trial continues this week in District Judge B. William Ekstrum's court in Washington County.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Stephen Allwine allegedly had no moral objection to sleeping with women other than his wife, but he was opposed to divorce\u2014or, at least, his church was. It's for that reason that he tried to arrange his wife's murder through the dark web and finally killed her himself when no other killer appeared, prosecutors allege. At the start of Allwine's murder trial in Minnesota this week, prosecutors claimed the United Church of God elder began having affairs through the Ashley Madison website, which he learned about while counseling married couples at church, reports the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Since his church views marriage as a lifelong commitment, per the Washington Post, prosecutors believe the then-43-year-old Allwine decided his wife should be killed and paid $6,000 in bitcoin to dark web site Besa Mafia, which claimed a link to organized crime. Though law enforcement officials now suspect Besa Mafia was a scam, they warned the couple that user \"Dogdaygod\" was plotting Amy Allwine's death. Stephen Allwine then bought a gun, which was found next to his wife's body in the couple's Cottage Grove home three months later on Nov. 13, 2016. Prosecutors say Allwine drugged Amy, 43, with scopolamine, shot her in the head, and staged the scene to look like a suicide\u2014failing to erase gun residue from his hand and traces of blood leading from the scene. A computer search also linked him to \"Dogdaygod,\" prosecutors say. Allwine's defense attorney, on the other hand, says the prosecution has only theories and alleges police contaminated the scene by moving the gun before photos were taken, per the Pioneer Press. \"Just because he had an affair doesn't mean he killed his wife,\" he says of his client, per the Post.",

(Associated Press) \n \n LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) \u2014 A faith ministry in Nebraska has started a fundraising campaign to buy out four stores that sell millions of cans of beer each year in a tiny village next to a South Dakota Indian reservation plagued by alcoholism. \n \n The Lakota Hope street ministry in Whiteclay is looking to raise at least $6.3 million to close the stores, which are only about 200 yards from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. The officially dry reservation is plagued by high rates of fetal alcohol syndrome and encompasses some of the nation's poorest counties. \n \n Whiteclay only has about a dozen residents, yet the four stores sold 3.5 million cans of beer in 2015. The beer stores have remained opened for decades despite state investigations into alleged liquor law violations, lawsuits and protests that occasionally turned violent. \n \n Ministry founder Bruce BonFleur and his wife have lived in Whiteclay for nearly two decades, feeding people on the streets and launching programs designed to help members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe. BonFleur said he has talked with the businesses, and \"we believe that the beer store owners are ready to sell out.\" \n \n The stores have been facing increasing legal and political pressure, and state liquor regulators are meeting next month to discuss the stores' licenses. \n \n Still, some activists have their doubts. Olowan Martinez, an Oglala Lakota activist who has led protests against Whiteclay, said she would be thrilled but shocked if the buyout worked as intended. Martinez said she would support replacing the stores with a roller skating rink, movie theater or a park to help entertain young people. \n \n The idea rang hollow to Frank LaMere, a Native American activist who has fought for 18 years to close the stores. LaMere said the beer store owners shouldn't be rewarded with a payout and wants the state to revoke their liquor licenses. \n \n \"Whiteclay sadly continues to be the golden goose to many,\" LaMere said. \n \n On a recent day in the Whiteclay, some people were passed out on garbage-strewn sidewalks or begging for change. Others loitered on the streets or in abandoned houses littered with dirty blankets and empty beer cans. Some people wandered along the side of the main highway through town, Nebraska Highway 87, which leads into the reservation, past 1970s-era federal housing, decrepit mobile homes and abandoned cars. \n \n Lance Moss, a Whiteclay grocery store owner who does not sell alcohol, said he didn't know if the town would change substantially if the beer stores were sold. Moss said some regular visitors might congregate in Whiteclay and buy beer from bootleggers. \n \n \"Obviously, all the beer that's sold in Whiteclay is going to get sold someplace else,\" he said. \n \n The Nebraska Liquor Control Commission is set to meet March 7 to discuss the stores' liquor licenses amid complaints that the village lacks adequate law enforcement. Last month, the local county board with jurisdiction over Whiteclay recommended that the state renew the licenses, partially amid concerns that closing the stores would lead to an increase of intoxicated drivers in Nebraska. \n \n Representatives of two of the Whiteclay beer stores, Stateline Liquor and Arrowhead Inn, declined to comment because of their pending cases before the liquor commission. Attempts to reach the owners of the Jumping Eagle Inn and D&S Pioneer Service weren't immediately successful. \n \n The ministry's new effort is called \"B.O.B.S. Whiteclay P.L.A.N.,\" short for \"Buy out the beer stores\" and \"Promote the Lakotas as a nation.\" \n \n __ \n \n Online: https://whiteclayredo.com/ \n \n __ \n \n Follow Grant Schulte on Twitter at https://twitter.com/GrantSchulte ||||| The Solution \n \n Contrasted against the old liquor store buildings, the Makerspace will provide a safe place to work, access to art supplies, and state of the art equipment. \n \n The space will also provide an online store where our local artists can establish a more reliable income and teaching/mentoring opportunities.",

    "document": "Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor is accustomed to shocking people. The Irish singer has been a natural-born attention getter since she first gained fame over 20 years ago, when she was as recognizable for her shorn head and fiercely outspoken opinions as she was for her haunting voice and arresting beauty. So when she turned up to perform at Ireland's Bray Music Festival over the weekend, it was inevitable that she'd create an uproar. The latest wild stunt from the woman who once defiantly ripped up a picture of the pope on \"Saturday Night Live\"? Getting older and gaining weight. The horror! \n \n Sporting a short dark bob, eyeglasses, a belly-revealing mesh top and a more ample figure than fans remember from her \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" heyday, the 44-year-old dared to appear, as Inquisitr helpfully noted,\"No Longer Bald or Skinny.\" ABC News asked, \"Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor, Is That You?\" and ran the inevitable slide show of celebrity weight-loss ups and downs, while E! crowed that O'Connor went \"from looking like Natalie Portman in 'V for Vendetta' to your dorky self in high school\" and did its own slide show of \"shocking transformations.\" \n \n It's not entirely surprising that the image of a bald, white-clad waif would be so indelible in the public mind. O'Connor has lived largely out of the spotlight for several years now, and has not released any new music since 2005. Even her own website is conspicuously riddled with photos of her more familiar doe-eyed and pixie-ish image. Yet the Internet outpouring of astonishment mixed with glee over her changed appearance has been the truly unpleasant sight in all of this. On People.com alone, there are hundreds of comments -- many on the theme of what a \"shameless blimpo\" \"pig\" she's become, and many others flat out refusing to believe that the photographs are truly of O'Connor. \n \n Anyone who is old enough to have had a moment of disbelief regarding the Facebook friend request of a long-lost pal knows that time does not march equally over everyone. The changes we barely notice on the people we're around all the time don't register as dramatically as those on the faces and bodies of those we don't see regularly. The urge to contrast then and now, to check off either the \"still got it\" or \"let themselves go\" boxes in our minds is powerful. It's the subtext that drives high school reunions and the Googling of ex-lovers, the reason former Clash guitarist Mick Jones once musically bragged that among his accomplishments, \"Somehow I stayed thin while the other guys got fat.\" And for the legions of detractors O'Connor has amassed over her outspoken career, perhaps there's a strange satisfaction in seeing evidence that she's no longer the head-turner who could rock a chrome-dome and still be gorgeous. Bet you're not so high and mighty now, missy! \n \n Yet as Carrie Fisher recently remarked of her long-ago golden bikini heyday, \"I swear when I was shooting those films I never realized I was signing an invisible contract to stay looking the exact same way for the rest of my existence.\" So Sin\u00e9ad is likewise no longer the woman she was in 1990. And yes, big shoulder pads and see-through tops are a sartorial misstep on almost everyone. But is any of that really a cause for such a conspicuous outpouring of schadenfreude? O'Connor is now a mother of four who has been open about her struggles with bipolar disorder. In 2007, she told Oprah Winfrey, \"I actually kind of died and got born again as a result of taking the meds.\" And as some of O'Connor's more charitable online defenders have noted, many of the medications used to treat bipolarism also cause weight gain. \n \n \"Shocking\" though O'Connor may continue to be to others, the singer, who claims she \"really enjoyed\" her recent Bray set, seems to have in recent years become far less scandalous to herself. In 2008, she genially told an Australian newspaper, \"I am not a pop star as I was ... so I am not having to deal with that kind of attention. Then I was young and now I am old and ugly and a bit fat ... I'm entitled to have a belly.\" She's also entitled to change her hairstyle, haters. \n \n As it happens, this morning on the way to a doctor's appointment, I passed by a neighbor I hadn't seen in a while. I almost didn't recognize her, because she too has transformed of late. She was thinner and paler, and on her head she wore the telltale headscarf of a woman going through chemo. So in case anybody out there needs a reminder, here it is: To be able to grow older is a gift. To be on medication that can save your life is a blessing. A little thickening around the middle seems like a small price to pay. Though much has changed in the more than two decades since Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor was that volatile, beautiful rock star, many things have improved with time. The once-suicidal girl now admits that \"It doesn't matter if things aren't perfect.\" And tempered by life and experience, that clear, achingly lovely voice has only become more poignantly astonishing. ||||| LONDON -- In 1990, Sinead O\u2019Connor\u2019s cover of a near-forgotten Prince single, \u201cNothing Compares 2U,\u201d burst onto the global musical consciousness like an exploding firework. Combining soaring vocals with the shock of a shaven head that served only to make her expressive eyes more poignant, O\u2019Connor\u2019s performance was mesmerizing. \n \n Fame followed -- and later imploded -- amid a slew of unpopular religious and political opinions from the singer, including an attack on the Roman Catholic Church for its cover-up of child sex abuse. \n \n Despite the fall from grace the singer remained entrancing, combining gamine fragility with an appetite for hard politics. Her tight crew cut, consciously anti-feminine Doc Marten boots, baggy sweaters and old men\u2019s overcoats remained her trademark look. And nothing she wore or didn\u2019t wear could disguise the sheer power of her vocal and lyrical talent. \n \n Earlier this week, more than two decades after her astonishing debut, pictures of a very different looking O\u2019Connor surfaced online after a performance at the Bray Music Festival on the West Coast of Ireland. Showing a frumpier, bespectacled O\u2019Connor under a mop of black hair and in black garb that would have been nun-like, but for the exposure of a generous segment of plump belly, the singer\u2019s appearance has caused quite a stir -- even on our own website. \n \n Newspapers, online blogs and the social media sphere of Facebook and Twitter, have erupted with astonishment and shock at O\u2019Connor\u2019s transformation. \n \n \u201cThe 44-year year-old singer was unrecognizable from her musical heyday as she took to the stage wearing a highly unflattering combination of a stomach-baring black net top, and an ill-fitting black trouser suit,\u201d said the Daily Mail. \n \n As if that weren\u2019t damning enough, the singer\u2019s self-absorbed air appears to have irked the paper further: \u201cWith her black hair in a messy crop, and wearing glasses and a gold crucifix necklace, Sinead appeared to be in a world of her own as she performed alongside [reggae singer Natty] Wailer.\u201d \n \n Closer to home, Us Weekly wrote that the singer had shocked her fans with a look that was \u201ccompletely unrecognizable,\u201d while ABC News put the \u201cformerly slim\u201d singer in a gallery of stars including Kirstie Alley and Jennifer Hudson who have had trouble with their yo-yo-ing weight. \u201cNothing compares\u2026to what Sinead O\u2019 Connor looks like now,\u201d it captioned. \n \n Hang on. Should a singer who used her window of fame to highlight discomfiting political opinions as well as bringing hauntingly personal songs like \u201cTroy\u201d and \u201cThree Babies\u201d into the musical canon really be judged by the same harsh standards that are common currency for actresses and reality TV stars? \n \n Sinead O\u2019Connor is no Kim Kardashian, whose every eyebrow pluck and forehead wax is the stuff of a celebrity interview or product endorsement. Nor is she a Natalie Portman or Renee Zellweger, whose morphing body shape is part of her artistic reach. \n \n Instead, the Dublin-born singer, who has four children since achieving the heights of fame, has always turned her back on the conventions of beauty that are apparently necessary for media acceptance. The prickly distaste that she still manifests for a prototypical feminine style seems remarkably unchanged from the attitudes she held in her youth. \n \n \"What the voices expressing astonishment at her new look are really shocked by, is that Sinead O\u2019Connor should care so little for the opinions by which so many in the entertainment industry are harshly judged.\" \n \n Per the outrage that has followed the singer\u2019s appearance at Bray, you could be forgiven for thinking that O\u2019Connor has spent the last decade and a half under a rock, all the better to astonish her fans when she re-emerged several kilos heavier and without a bald head. In fact, she has an enjoyed a musical career that has continued, somewhat under the radar, and the singer has released a new album every two years or since 2000 as well as touring recently in Moscow and the UK. \n \n What the voices expressing astonishment at her new look are really shocked by, is that Sinead O\u2019Connor should care so little for the opinions by which so many in the entertainment industry are harshly judged. The astonishment at her weight gain is as much at her carelessness of what others think of her as it is about a singer succumbing to the ageing process over 20 years. In fact, it\u2019s not overplaying it to suggest that her critics are actually uncomfortable with her refusal to hide herself away permanently now that the years where gamine skinniness was her trademark look are in the past. \n \n It is just weeks since the music industry deified Amy Winehouse, a troubled singer whose addictions transfixed tabloid readers during the years that they also cruelly foreshortened a talented jazz diva\u2019s life. \n \n Like O\u2019Connor, Winehouse\u2019s talent was of the once-in-a-generation kind, a degree of difference away from even the commercial heights achieved by the likes of Adele, another British talent who for all her record-selling success, falls into a more conventional mold. Even as Winehouse\u2019s failed romances and damaging addictions were lived out in the harsh glare of newspaper front pages, her emaciated thinness, hyper-sexualized outfits and suspiciously enhanced cleavage nonetheless less fell on the right side of the aesthetic the entertainment industry is prepared to accept. \n \n Unlike Winehouse, Connor has managed to get through life, have a family and keep doing what her fans want her to do: perform and record music. Along the way her various admissions of suffering child abuse, a bipolar disorder and coming out as a lesbian suggest that the journey has not been without its demons. \n \n But, far from criticizing the singer for her temerity to continue performing even when she does not fit the nostalgic memory of two decades past, O\u2019Connor should congratulated for her ability to keep on going. Twenty years on, the lyrics of songs like \u201cFeel So Different,\u201d \u201cI Do Not Want What I Have Not Got\u201d and \u201cThree Babies\u201d have become even more poignant than they were the first time around. \n \n And as this video of the singer performing \u201cNothing Compares 2U\u201d in Moscow last month shows, her voice has lost none of its ability to astound and move.",

    "document": "Teenager Autumn Veatch, one of three passengers on a missing plane presumed crashed in the North Cascades, survived in rugged terrain for two days before being found and taken to an Okanogan County hospital Monday with minor injuries. \n \n BELLINGHAM \u2014 The voice on the phone was a miracle. \n \n It wasn\u2019t another reporter, wasn\u2019t search-and-rescue officials, wasn\u2019t more supportive friends. \n \n It was Autumn Veatch, 16, calling Monday from a hospital in Brewster, Okanogan County, telling her father, David Veatch, and friends an unbelievable tale of survival. \n \n It was a voice most of them had privately feared they would never hear again. \n \n Autumn Veatch was not, as many had feared, dead in a small-plane crash in the North Cascades. She was alive, and aside from some minor burns, dehydration and exhaustion from a two-day ordeal that surely will qualify as an epic survival tale, Autumn was OK. \n \n And she was more than ready to come home, she told her father and family friends gathered around a speakerphone in the family\u2019s Bellingham apartment. \n \n \u201cI just can\u2019t believe she went through all that she did,\u201d the 49-year-old father said late Monday after driving four hours to the hospital. \n \n Details of her ordeal during the brief hospital call were sparse, but rejoicing was immense, said Santina Lampman, a longtime family friend in the room Monday afternoon who later recounted the call to The Seattle Times. \n \n During the call, Autumn quickly explained how the small plane she\u2019d been traveling in with her step-grandparents, Leland and Sharon Bowman, of Marion, Mont., had crashed in the rugged North Cascades. Autumn somehow survived the impact and futilely tried to pull the Bowmans from the wreckage. \n \n She stuck by the scene for some time, hoping for help, Autumn told them. But ultimately, she decided she needed to get out of the mountains on her own. \n \n The Bellingham High School junior-to-be had little outdoor training, but she did what survival experts probably would have advised: She followed drainage down to a river, then the river, via a trail, downstream to the nearest road, Lampman said. \n \n Authorities identified the trail as the Easy Pass trail, a popular but difficult hike in the rugged mountain terrain. It led Autumn to Highway 20, the North Cascades Highway, where she caught a ride with hikers to the nearest community \u2014 Mazama, in the Methow Valley \u2014 and contacted authorities. \n \n Listen to the 911 call \n \n When Autumn walked into the Mazama Store on Monday, store manager Serena Lockwood said she looked \u201cdazed and not fully aware of what was going on.\u201d \n \n C.B. Thomas, the first responder from Aero Methow and another manager at the store, said Veatch arrived at 2:45 p.m. wearing a loose sweater, jeans and sneakers. He said she hadn\u2019t had anything to eat or drink for \u201cabout three days.\u201d \n \n \u201cShe was obviously upset and distraught,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cShe was shaking. She was certainly able to communicate her situation and kind of apologized for being upset and not speaking clearly.\u201d \n \n She was taken to Three Rivers Hospital in Brewster with non-life-threatening injuries, but she was suffering from dehydration and exposure to the elements, officials said. She was admitted overnight and diagnosed with treatable rhabdomyolysis, a breakdown of muscle tissue that leads to damaging protein in the blood. \n \n Autumn was pretty \u201cdrugged up\u201d when Veatch and two family friends arrived at the hospital late Monday, but she seemed happy to see them, he said.

But information provided by Autumn helped narrow down the search area where the plane is believed to have crashed, officials said. \n \n Searching for the plane is difficult because authorities are dealing with \u201crocks and trees and lots of nooks and crannies,\u201d Himmel added. \n \n \u201cProbably the most difficult terrain to try and do the search in the state of Washington,\u201d he said. \n \n The Beech A-35 left Montana about 1 p.m. PDT Saturday.

They arrived late Monday. \n \n The jubilation over Autumn\u2019s survival was tinged with regret at the possible deaths of the Bowmans. \n \n \u201cI feel terrible for the family of the grandparents,\u201d Lampman said. \n \n Autumn Veatch, a former Sehome High School student, continued to live with her father after her parents divorced and her mother, Misty Bowman, relocated to Montana a couple of years ago, friends said. The mother declined to comment Monday night. \n \n \u201cShe\u2019s an amazing, witty, creative, loving human being,\u201d said Chelsey Clark, a family friend of Autumn\u2019s and her father. \u201cShe loves art, she\u2019s amazing at drawing, she loves music and she\u2019s a quirky, sarcastic girl.\u201d \n \n Even as Autumn was making her way out of the mountains, a data trail from previous activity on her cellphone was helping searchers locate the plane\u2019s last known position. \n \n Lampman\u2019s 16-year-old daughter provided searchers with screen grabs of times and contents of Autumn\u2019s last text messages to her friends \u2014 apparently providing the last known cell signal used to establish a search area, Lampman said. \n \n When Amber heard the news that her friend was alive, \u201cShe lost it.

But there was no sign of the aircraft or its occupants until Autumn Veatch, 16, followed a trail to state Route 20, near the east entrance to North Cascades National Park. \n \n A motorist picked her up Monday afternoon and drove her 30 miles east to a general store in Mazama, where employees called 911. The Aero Methow Rescue Service sent a paramedic team to check her out before she was taken to a hospital in Brewster for treatment of what appeared to be minor injuries, said Cindy Button, director of services at the organization. \n \n \"Our initial information is she sustained no life-threatening injuries and is somewhat dehydrated due to being out in the elements,\" said Scott Graham, CEO of Three Rivers Hospital. \n \n Okanogan County Sheriff Frank Rogers said Monday afternoon that the girl had been \"walking for a couple of days.\" He declined to comment on the status of the other two people aboard the plane. \n \n Serena Lockwood, the manager at the Mazama Store, said the girl and a motorist came in Monday afternoon, saying she had been in a plane crash. \n \n \"She was obviously pretty traumatized,\" Lockwood said. \n \n Rescuers celebrated Veatch's survival, but they immediately returned their focus to finding the wreckage, aided by Veatch's description of the crash site, said Lt. Col. Jeffrey Lustick of the Civil Air Patrol. Lustick said he could not confirm any details about the condition of the grandparents, Leland and Sharon Bowman of Marion, Montana. \n \n \"We're so happy about this,\" Lustick said. \"I've spent 30 years in the Civil Air Patrol and in search-and-rescue.

San Francisco City Attorney\u2019s Office \n \n It was fun while it lasted. \n \n The wheels came off San Francisco\u2019s short-distance transportation experiment on Monday, when City Attorney Dennis Herrera sent a cease and desist letter to three companies that had flooded the city\u2019s streets with electric scooter rentals. \n \n The scooters, which were popular in spite of some maintenance issues, represent a wave of venture capital money pouring into short-distance transportation tools. One of the companies, Bird, has become a familiar presence on the streets and sidewalks near its headquarters in Santa Monica, California. It\u2019s of a piece with the dockless and electric bicycle boom, epitomized by Uber\u2019s high-value acquisition of e-bike start-up Jump last week. \n \n But nowhere have scooters blanketed a city quite like San Francisco. Among the city\u2019s complaints: The scooter companies have violated state law (yes, apparently California has a state statute governing electric scooters) by allowing riders to scoot on sidewalks, without helmets, and with two people to a scooter. Helmet laws in particular tend to be the kiss of death for shared mobility programs, sending potential users back into taxi cabs. \n \n Below are the photos the City Attorney released to bolster the case for a crackdown, noting, \u201cWe cannot overstate the public safety hazard that operating motorized scooters pose on City sidewalks.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe cannot overstate the public safety hazard that operating motorized scooters pose on City sidewalks,\u201d the City Attorney writes.

At least two San Franciscans, including Peskin, claim to have broken their toes tripping over scooters. \n \n However, as many San Franciscans have pointed out, the presence of scooters is in many ways less of a nuisance\u2014and objectively, less of a danger\u2014than the city\u2019s private automobiles. Joe Rivano Barros made the point in a series of tweets over the weekend: \n \n San Franciscans may find the scooters a nuisance, but it\u2019s mostly that they are an unfamiliar one, and for some residents, a reminder that the city is changing. \n \n Update, 5:50 p.m. After this article was published, a spokesperson for the City Attorney responded to a question: How many documented injuries or accidents had occurred involving electric scooters?

San Francisco is ordering three companies that rent out motorized scooters to stop operating until they can ensure riders are following state law and the dockless devices are not a hazard to the public.... (Associated Press) \n \n SAN FRANCISCO (AP) \u2014 San Francisco is ordering three companies that began renting motorized foot-pedal scooters in the city last month to stop operating until they can ensure riders are obeying state laws and that the devices are not a hazard to the public. \n \n City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in letters to LimeBike, Bird and Spin that the city has received numerous complaints of riders whizzing by on sidewalks, not wearing helmets and parking the devices on sidewalks, obstructing the right of way. \n \n Despite previous warnings, the scooter companies are \"creating a public nuisance on the city's streets and sidewalks and endangering public health and safety,\" he wrote. \n \n Hundreds of the scooters began appearing around the tech-friendly city in March, and were quickly picked up by riders. They have become an annoyance for many because they do not require docking stations and can be set down anywhere when a ride is over. \n \n California law requires riders of motorized scooters to wear a helmet, not carry passengers and not operate on sidewalks. The rules appear in videos riders must watch and sign off on when they download the cellphone app that unlocks the scooters. \n \n Herrera provided the companies with photographs showing scooters lying in the middle of sidewalks and people riding without helmets. They have until April 30 to address complaints, he said. \n \n Jack Handley, who works at his family-run hotel, said he pays about $2 to use a scooter for about five minutes, which he said he rides on the street. \n \n \"I can grab one and zoom on over to where I need to go and then zoom right back,\" Handley said after dropping off a LimeBike outside a FedEx office in downtown San Francisco. \n \n He said he would stop using them if he is required to get a permit or wear a helmet. \n \n \"I'm not going to carry a helmet with me,\" he said. \"I would rather walk than go through that headache.\" \n \n The San Francisco Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved legislation requiring the scooter companies have transit agency permits to operate and to allow public workers to remove scooters without permits from streets or sidewalks. \n \n The ordinance requires companies to educate users about how to safely ride and store the devices and establishes fines starting at $125 per scooter. \n \n \"Sidewalks are for pedestrians and strollers and disabled individuals and wheelchairs,\" said the law's author, Supervisor Aaron Peskin. \n \n \"We're not trying to ban them,\" he said. \"But we want to make sure that they're operating in a way that is helpful to the transportation problems of San Francisco.\" \n \n David Estrada, chief legal officer for Santa Monica, California-based Bird Rides Inc., said the company wants to work with city officials to solve traffic problems in San Francisco. \n \n \"They request we do some education for riders and request we implement some technology to address some of the issues, we have all of that in the works,\" Estrada said. \n \n The company, whose founder Travis VanderZanden was chief operating officer at Lyft and former vice president of global driver growth at Uber, started a pilot program Tuesday requiring San Francisco riders to take a photo showing how they parked the scooter at the end of their trip, Estrada said. \n \n Users who repeatedly violate the rules will be suspended, said Kenneth Baer, a spokesman for Bird. \"San Franciscans have logged more than 90,000 miles on Birds, which shows that there is great demand for new, environmentally friendly ways to get around this great city,\" Baer said. \n \n Santa Monica's city attorney in December filed a criminal complaint against Bird, saying the company was operating without a permit and had ignored required licensing and orders to remove the scooters from sidewalks. Bird pleaded no contest and agreed to pay more than $300,000 in fines and secure proper licenses. \n \n Spokespeople for San Mateo, California-based LimeBike and San Francisco-based Skinny Labs Inc., also known as Spin, did not immediately return emails seeking comment Tuesday. \n \n ___ \n \n This story has been clarified to note Peskin was the law's author, not sponsor. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Terry Chea and Ryan Nakashima contributed to this report. ||||| The San Francisco Board of Supervisors unanimously voted today to approve the ordinance that looks to regulate electric scooters in San Francisco. The ordinance seeks to establish regulation and a permitting process that would enable the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency or Department of Public Works to take action against scooters from companies that don\u2019t have an official permit from the city. \n \n \u201cPart of the brouhaha has been really the function of the fact, which was admitted yesterday, was that some of these companies have been a little bit fast and loose with the truth,\u201d Supervisor Aaron Peksin, a sponsor of the ordinance, said today at the Board of Supervisors meeting.* \n \n Peskin is referencing the fact that Lime, Spin and Bird deployed their respective scooters without permission from the city. The permitting scheme the city has in mind, Peskin said, is very similar to the one San Francisco has in place around stationless bike-sharing. \n \n \u201cThis is a basic permitting scheme to allow the professional staff at SFMTA to permit these with sensible, regulatory frameworks and to be able to confiscate unpermitted vehicles or devices,\u201d Peskin said. \n \n He added that these electric scooters can absolutely serve some benefits to people in San Francisco, but that it does not mean the city should have to sacrifice its sidewalk space. The next step is for the BOS to continue working with the SFMTA to develop this regulation. At a hearing yesterday, the SFMTA said it hopes to open up the permitting process by May 1. \n \n Earlier in the meeting today, the BOS adopted a resolution to develop a working group to inform future legislation around emerging technologies. One of the resolution\u2019s sponsors, Supervisor Norman Yee, noted how he\u2019s heard from seniors and people in wheelchairs who are \u201cbeing imperiled and inconvenienced because they are having to navigate around scooters and bikes.\u201d \n \n He later added, the purpose of the working group would be to ensure the city is mindful of both the intended and unintended consequences of emerging technologies. \n \n Yesterday, SF City Attorney Dennis Herrera sent cease-and-desist letters to Lime, Bird and Spin, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be making any difference to Lime, Bird and Spin. All three of their respective scooters were found on the streets of San Francisco this morning. \n \n \u201cAs it says in the letter, the City Attorney has laid out some recommendations for operation that he will like to see implemented by April 30; he has not requested an immediate stoppage of service,\u201d a Bird spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cWe are taking his concerns very seriously and reviewing his recommendations for improving Bird in San Francisco.\u201d Lime says it\u2019s taking the City Attorney seriously, as well as the vote by the BOS today. \u201cIn response, we are updating our current community outreach plan to address the City\u2019s concerns about pedestrian safety, parking compliance, and rider education,\u201d a Lime spokesperson told TechCrunch. \u201cWe plan to roll out new initiatives, along with our complete response to the City Attorney by the end of next week.\u201d Lime says it will also provide helmets to users, which will we able for pickup starting April 22. Similar to Bird, Lime will also start requiring people to submit a photo of their properly parked scooter at the end of the ride. Additionally, Lime says it will more clearly state that riding on or blocking sidewalks is illegal. I\u2019ve reached out to Spin about its operations in San Francisco. I\u2019ll update this story if I hear back. \n \n An earlier version of this story misattributed Supervisor Aaron Peskin\u2019s quotes to another supervisor.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A battle between the city of San Francisco and companies that rent out motorized scooters has come to a head: On Tuesday, the Board of Supervisors unanimously approved an ordinance seeking to regulate the scooters, TechCrunch reports. At issue is the fact that the companies\u2014LimeBike, Spin, and Bird\u2014started operating three weeks ago without approval from the city, and city authorities say the electric scooters can be dangerous. \"We cannot overstate the public safety hazard that operating motorized scooters pose on City sidewalks,\" said City Attorney Dennis Herrera in a cease-and-desist letter to the companies Monday, per Slate. The letter ordered the companies to stop operating until a plan was in place to make sure customers stop riding on sidewalks and without helmets or drivers licenses, and stop parking in places that block sidewalks, ramps, and transit stops. (They don't require a docking station and can thus be left anywhere when riders are done using them, the AP reports.) TechCrunch says the letter didn't \"seem to be making any difference,\" as scooters from all three companies were spotted on San Francisco streets Tuesday. The Board of Supervisors is looking to put a permitting process in place for the scooter companies similar to the one that exists for bike-sharing companies operating in the city; it hopes to have the process in place by May 1. It also plans to establish fines starting at $125 when scooter regulations are violated.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 It was fun while it lasted. The wheels came off San Francisco's short-distance transportation experiment on Monday, when City Attorney Dennis Herrera sent a cease and desist letter to three companies that had flooded the city's streets with electric scooter rentals. The scooters, which were popular in spite of some maintenance issues, represent a wave of venture capital money pouring into short- distance transportation tools. One of the companies, Bird, has become a familiar presence on the streets and sidewalks near its headquarters in Santa Monica, Calif. But nowhere have scooters blanketed a city quite like San Francisco. Among the city\u2019s complaints: The scooter companies have violated state law (yes, apparently California has a state statute governing electric scooters) by allowing riders to scoot on sidewalks, without helmets, and with two people to a scooter. Helmet laws in particular tend to be the kiss of death for shared mobility programs, sending potential users back into taxi cabs,\u201d the San Francisco Chronicle quotes Herrera as saying. San Francisco has received complaints of riders not wearing helmets and scooters lying in the middle of sidewalks, according to SFist.com.",

(While it\u2019s been widely reported in recent years that salsa is now the No. 1 condiment over ketchup, Euromonitor sensibly categorizes salsa as a dip, not a condiment.) \n \n Mustard, which is a complete inverse to mayo, health-wise, came in nearly last on the list, after soy sauce, barbecue sauce and hot sauce, besting only steak sauce. \n \n Mayo has always seemed to be the pet condiment among chefs, most of whom use it liberally and take pride in whisking together their own. \n \n \u201cMayonnaise is the result of eggs and olive oil. They go out on a date and have a really good time,\" restaurateur and \"Top Chef\" alum Fabio Viviani told TODAY.com. \u201cChefs love olive oil and eggs separately. Of course they would like the combination.\u201d \n \n Viviani has nothing against mayo haters. \u201cIt\u2019s a personal preference,\u201d he says, but those who claim to hate the condiment might want to try the ham sandwich with sweet pineapple mayo from his cookbook, \"Fabio\u2019s Italian Kitchen.\" He also suggests trying mixing herbs, sun-dried tomato or pesto into mayo. \u201cThink about mayonnaise as a white canvas and you are the Michelangelo of food,\u201d he said. \n \n But mayo has its staunch detractors, of course, even among kitchen pros. \n \n Mayo-hating chef Stephen Jones, of Blue Hound Kitchen & Cocktails in Phoenix, gets around his disdain for the condiment by making a flavorful a\u00efoli with whole grain mustard, bacon fat, roasted garlic, shallots and herbs to use in potato salad, for instance. \n \n \u201cI really hate mayo. It\u2019s fatty\u2014not the good fatty\u2014tasteless, and just flat-out gross,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do have it at the restaurant, but we never offer it or suggest it. If a guest does request it, we will happily give it to them, but not after we have tried to offer up one of our a\u00efolis first though,\u201d he joked. \n \n \u201cMy sous chefs give me the riot act everyday about my dislike of mayo. They think I'm nuts,\u201d he added. \u201cBut there a lot of closet mayo-haters out there and we all need to unite!\u201d \n \n Philadelphia-based marketing professional Craig Horwitz hates mayo so much, he started a site eight years ago called holdthatmayo.com, and is even co-directed a mockumentary film called \"The Mayo Conspiracy,\" which will be showing in Philly on March 9 and making the film festival rounds later this year. \n \n \u201cEverything about mayo makes me queasy. The slimy, whitish-yellow color, the consistency, the smell, the fact that it is made from raw eggs!\u201d Horwitz said. \n \n He gets around the mayo issue with a lot of tomato (\u201cextremely under-rated as a sandwich moisturizer,\u201d he said), avocado (\u201cone of our bigger weapons in the war against mayonnaise\u201d) and Greek yogurt (\u201cwhich solves the whole tuna fish dilemma\u201d). \n \n \u201cIt can be challenging at restaurants, since so many people want to slime up sandwiches and salads without first getting our permission,\u201d Horwitz said. \u201cThe key is to stay on your toes, ask questions and usually finish the order by saying \"absolutely no mayo\" at a much higher volume.\u201d \n \n Indeed, Texas-based chef Tim Love\u2014a spokesperson for Hellman\u2019s\u2014says mayo is in a lot of restaurant dishes you might not even be aware of. At his restaurants, it may be the base for a dip, used as a binder in a casserole, or added to roast chicken for moisture. \n \n \u201cI think mayo haters are missing out,\u201d he says. \u201cHaters can be won over by realizing that they've probably eaten it and enjoyed it.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 You put it on hot dogs, hamburgers, fries, and a whole slew of other stuff, but ketchup doesn't even come close to the king of condiments. That would be mayonnaise\u2014$2 billion of which is sold in the US each year, compared with around $800 million of the red stuff, Euromonitor data shows, per Quartz. In fact, ketchup almost missed out on the number two spot to soy sauce, which came in at $725 million, followed by barbeque sauce at $660 million, hot sauce at $550 million, and mustard at $450 million. (If you're wondering about salsa, it was considered a dip in this case, but would have grabbed the No. 2 spot from ketchup.) While one chef tells NBC News that mayo is \"fatty\u2014not the good fatty,\" the condiment's top spot doesn't necessarily show off America's love of fatty foods. Quartz points out that the low-fat mayo market has doubled since 2005 as Americans look for healthier options. Another reason for its peak position? It's in everything from tuna salad to spicy tuna rolls, plus hidden in plenty of restaurant dishes you're probably not aware of. Meanwhile, amid mayo's success, Heinz is trying to boost its ketchup sales with its first Super Bowl ad in 16 years, which Adweek has here.",

(Associated Press) \n \n San Francisco's hard-hitting, opportunistic defense set the tone in the 49ers' thrilling 36-32 playoff win the same way it has all season. \n \n From Justin Smith and Aldon Smith harassing Drew Brees all day, to Patrick Willis and NaVorro Bowman shutting down the running game and Dashon Goldson making punishing hits and key plays from the secondary, the defense is the biggest reason for the resurgence in San Francisco that has the 49ers (14-3) back in the NFC championship for the first time since the 1997 season. \n \n They will play the Giants next Sunday at Candlestick Park after New York defeated the defending Super Bowl champion Green Bay Packers 37-20 on Sunday. San Francisco beat Eli Manning and the Giants 27-20 at home Nov. 13. \n \n \"It's a lot better than traveling to Wisconsin. More importantly, we're playing a team we've already faced,\" cornerback Carlos Rogers said Sunday. \"It's not as hard as preparing for another team we haven't faced yet.\" \n \n \"Home game huh?\" Whitner tweeted Sunday once his opponent had been determined. \n \n An offensive show featuring four lead changes defined the final five minutes of the Niners' win Saturday, capped by Alex Smith's 14-yard touchdown pass to Vernon Davis with 9 seconds remaining. But Whitner got things going in the franchise's first postseason appearance in nine years. \n \n \"It let the (Saints) offense know we were going to be physical all day,\" Whitner said of the hit on Thomas, who left with a head injury and never returned. \n \n Whitner was unfazed by his pass interference penalty moments earlier that briefly sent shaken-up tight end Jimmy Graham to the sideline. Whitner's jarring, legal helmet-to-helmet hit on Thomas was a blow to the Saints' psyche as well as to their depth chart. \n \n The 49ers defense has been so stingy this season they didn't allow a 100-yard runner or a rushing touchdown until the second-to-last game of the year Dec. 24 at Seattle. Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott, part of plenty of top-notch defenses himself, has praised these men for not \"giving up inches.\" \n \n \"We've got a great defense. We feel like we can stop anyone,\" Bowman said. \"When it's not working for our offense, it's our job to get the ball back for them as many times as we can. That's all it was. If those guys aren't doing well it's our job to pick it up. That's what a team is and I think we have a great one here.\" \n \n First-year coach Jim Harbaugh brought defensive coordinator Vic Fangio along with him from Stanford when he was hired last January _ and Fangio has developed his unit into one of the NFL's best. \n \n \"We like to think that we play defense the right way,\" Fangio said. \"We play physical, we play with our hands. We run to the ball. We don't try and do anything too fancy, although we do have our changeups here and there. We try and play defense the old-fashioned, hard school way.\" \n \n The Niners had 38 takeaways during the regular season to only 10 turnovers. Their plus-28 turnover differential matched the 2010 Patriots for the second-best mark in NFL history since 1941. \n \n They forced five more Saturday, and only had one turnover themselves. \n \n San Francisco's determined defenders heard all week how difficult it would be to stop Brees and Co., knowing many figured they'd fail. \n \n \"We got tired of it throughout the week. They gave us no chance,\" Goldson said. \"They kept talking about the Saints, the Saints, where they stand against us and what they were going to do. We ignored everything and focused on us and what we had to do to come win this game.\" \n \n Goldson had six interceptions for the NFC West champions during the regular season, then his biggest yet Saturday. That first-quarter pick snapped Brees' NFL-record streak of 226 postseason passes without an interception dating to the NFC championship game against Chicago five years ago. \n \n Tarell Brown had the other interception, while special teams standouts Blake Costanzo and Madieu Williams each forced a fumble. \n \n \"Our guys were humming. We were able to pry a couple out and that was big,\" Fangio said. \"The interceptions were big also.\" \n \n The Niners were No. 1 in the NFL in stopping the run during the season and didn't allow a rushing TD on Saturday after the Saints scored three on the ground in a 45-28 win over the Detroit Lions in the Superdome in last weekend's wild-card round. \n \n The Saints produced a playoff-record 626 yards against the Lions, with Brees throwing for 466 yards while completing 33 of 43 passes. \n \n \"I had figured coming into this game they would feel like, `Let's keep everything in front of us, let's not give up big plays and obviously do a good job against the rush and try to put them in third-and-long situations,'\" Brees said. \"They did, yet again, a great job stopping the run in a lot of cases which we felt like in order to really get chunks, we would have to throw it. Obviously that's a great defense. It's one of the best defenses in the league.\" \n \n Goldson was re-signed to a one-year contract as a free agent in August to complement newcomers and fellow defensive backs Whitner and Carlos Rogers. Against the Saints, Goldson had a team-leading 11 tackles to go with the first-quarter interception and two passes defensed. Bowman also made 11 tackles, 10 of those solo. \n \n \"We got some spectacular stops,\" Harbaugh said. \"On third down, I thought they were outstanding. Five takeaways in the game. I know the special teams contributed to that as well. Very opportunistic today. Got pressure on their quarterback. Made plays on the ball, and made them when they were there to be made. Our guys in the secondary made them. It was a terrific job by our defense, once again. You just love the way they play. You love the way they compete. Love how hard they work on the field.\" \n \n The 49ers sacked the record-setting Brees three times, including rookie Aldon Smith's pounding for an 11-yard loss on third down in the first quarter. All-Pro defensive tackle Justin Smith brought Brees to the ground for a 9-yard loss in the third quarter and Ahmad Brooks added a fourth-quarter sack on which Brees lost 7 yards. \n \n \"We wanted to come out and play our style of football, which is playing physical, being a great tackling team, and playing with good fundamentals which has carried us all year,\" Fangio said. \"We just wanted to play the way we've played all year, particularly starting early in the game.\" \n \n Whitner definitely did his part. \n \n \"I told myself that I was going to hit anything moving today and that I was going to be extremely physical, even if I hit my own guys,\" he said. \"Luckily, I didn't hit too many of my own guys.\" ||||| If style points and offensive fireworks meant anything, the Baltimore Ravens wouldn't stand a chance of making it to the AFC championship. \n \n Houston Texans head coach Gary Kubiak reacts to a play during the first half of an NFL divisional playoff football game against the Baltimore Ravens in Baltimore, Sunday, Jan. 15, 2012.

(Associated Press) \n \n Playing defense and protecting the football are what they do best, and that formula led to a 20-13 victory over the Houston Texans on Sunday, putting Baltimore in the AFC title game against the New England Patriots. \n \n \"I always say there is a right way to do things, there is a wrong way to do things and there is just the Ravens' way of doing things,\" linebacker Terrell Suggs said. \"It wasn't pretty but we're not really a pretty team. We got the W and now it's on to the AFC championship.\" \n \n The Ravens (13-4) had almost as many punts (nine) as first downs (11) and scored only three points over the final 46 minutes. But Baltimore wasn't penalized once, didn't commit a turnover, intercepted rookie quarterback T.J. Yates three times and totaled four takeaways _ two in the first quarter and two over the final eight minutes. \n \n \"If we didn't get any of those turnovers it would probably be a different game,\" Ravens defensive tackle Haloti Ngata said. \n \n Baltimore visits New England next Sunday, with the winner advancing to the Super Bowl in Indianapolis on Feb. 5. \n \n The Patriots lead the series 6-1, but Baltimore's lone win came in the postseason. \n \n \"We don't play the game until next week,\" Suggs said. \"I'm going to enjoy tonight.\" \n \n Veteran defensive stars Ed Reed and Ray Lewis led a unit that yielded only one touchdown and came up with the big play when one was needed. Lewis had a team-high seven tackles and Reed sealed the victory with the Ravens' fourth takeaway, an interception near the goal line in the closing minutes. \n \n \"It's winning by any means necessary,\" Reed said. \"That's what it's got to be.\" \n \n The Ravens finished 9-0 at home, but this one was anything but easy. Baltimore led 17-3 after the first quarter, and interceptions by Lardarius Webb and Reed in the final 7 1/2 minutes helped the advantage stand up. \n \n Reed has eight interceptions in 10 playoff games, few bigger than the last one. \n \n \"You can't say enough about him,\" Ravens linebacker Jarret Johnson said. \"His big plays always seem to happen when you need one.\" \n \n One week earlier, in the first playoff game in Texans history, Houston didn't commit a turnover in a 31-10 home rout of Cincinnati. Against Baltimore, the Texans couldn't hold onto the ball and quickly fell behind by two touchdowns. \n \n Arian Foster ran for 132 yards, the first player ever to rush for 100 yards against the Ravens in the postseason. But Yates' three interceptions matched the total he had in six regular season games. \n \n \"I can't have the turnovers,\" Yates said. \"If we don't turn the ball over like that, we have a chance to win. And we still had a chance to win. If I'd done a better job of protecting the football, I really think we'd have come out with the win today. We did a good job of moving the ball and we had some big plays, but you can't have that many picks.\" \n \n Yates was the third starting quarterback used by Houston this season following injuries to Matt Schaub and Matt Leinart. The Texans also lost wide receiver Andre Johnson for a spell and finished without sack specialist Mario Williams, who missed the last two-thirds of the season. \n \n And still, the Texans got within a win of reaching the conference title game. After the game, team owner Bob McNair pulled aside coach Gary Kubiak and congratulated him. \n \n \"I told him how proud I was. ... To come out and play the way this team has played, I think it's just remarkable,\" McNair said. \"Where would New England have been if (Tom) Brady wasn't playing, and if Wes Welker wasn't playing, and if their best defensive player wasn't playing? Go down the list of any of these teams and ask where they would be _ and they wouldn't be in the playoffs. And this team was in the playoffs.\" \n \n Down 17-13 at halftime, Houston twice held the Ravens without a first down in the third quarter before driving to the Baltimore 32. From there, Neil Rackers' 50-yard field goal try hit the crossbar and dropped into the end zone. \n \n Baltimore then launched a drive in which seldom-used Lee Evans made a sensational one-handed catch for a 30-yard gain on third-and-5 from the Houston 39. On fourth-and-goal inside the 1, Ray Rice was stuffed by linebacker Tim Dobbins for no gain. \n \n \"That's a huge play,\" Houston defensive end J.J. Watt said. \"Those are the type of plays that win playoffs games. Obviously, we wish it had gone the other way, but those are the type of plays that you remember.\" \n \n The Texans couldn't move the ball, and the Ravens took the ensuing punt at the Houston 49. But three plays netted only 4 yards, and Sam Koch punted for the seventh time. \n \n Minutes later, the Ravens went three and out for the fourth time in five second-half possessions. Fortunately for Baltimore, the defense compensated for the team's inability to add to its early lead. \n \n \"You have to do whatever you have to do to win a football game,\" Ravens coach John Harbaugh said. \n \n Webb's second interception came with 7 1/2 minutes left and the Ravens clinging to 17-13 advantage. Baltimore moved 45 yards to get a field goal by Billy Cundiff with 2:52 left. \n \n Houston's Danieal Manning muffled the record crowd of 71,547 by taking the opening kickoff 60 yards to the Baltimore 41. Yates then completed two straight passes, and after the Ravens stuffed Foster on a third-and-1, Rackers kicked a 40-yard field goal. \n \n Baltimore failed to get a first down on its first possession and had to punt. Jacoby Jones inexplicably attempted to field the bouncing ball at the 13-yard line, was immediately hit by Cary Williams and lost the ball, which was recovered by Baltimore rookie Jimmy Smith at the 2. \n \n On third down, Joe Flacco threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to Kris Wilson _ the tight end's first catch of the season. \n \n After a Houston punt, Flacco completed a 21-yard pass to Anquan Boldin to set up a 48-yard field goal for a 10-3 lead. \n \n Later in the first quarter, Ravens cornerback Lardarius Webb stepped in front of Johnson for an interception at the Houston 35. Five plays later, Flacco tossed a 10-yard touchdown pass to Boldin in the right side of the end zone. \n \n Yates then completed a pair of third-down passes in a 59-yard drive that ended with a field goal. \n \n After Yates misfired on third down from the Baltimore 10, the rookie came off the field he was greeted by coach Gary Kubiak, who put a hand on the back of the quarterback's jersey while chatting. \n \n Yates returned after a Baltimore punt to direct a 12-play, 86-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Foster, who accounted for 66 yards _ including 54 on the ground. \n \n Yates went 17 for 35 for 184 yards. Johnson had eight catches for 111 yards. \n \n Notes: Baltimore improved to 6-0 against Houston, 2-0 this season. ... It was the Ravens' first home playoff win since 2000. ... Foster ran for 285 yards in the postseason, most by a player in his first two NFL playoff games. ... With the Ravens' home win, it's the first time since the NFL went to current playoff format in 1990 that the first seven games have been won by the home team.",

San Francisco's hard-hitting, opportunistic defense set the tone the same way it has all season, putting the 49ers back in the NFC championship for the first time since the 1997 season. If style points and offensive fireworks meant anything, the Baltimore Ravens wouldn't stand a chance of making it to the AFC championship.

The offensive chatter was picked up by one of Fox's 200-plus, omnipresent on-course microphones, then mistakenly broadcast to millions of TV viewers watching FS1's coverage of Round 2 of the 2018 U.S. Open. \n \n \"Today, during the live FS1 broadcast of the 2018 U.S. Open, one of the many microphones on the course inadvertently picked up some offensive crowd chatter. We sincerely apologize,\" Fox Sports spokeswoman Anne Pennington said in a statement to Sporting News. \n \n When SN asked Pennington if the offensive audio came from fans on the course or a radio mixup, Pennington confirmed it came from the gallery. \n \n The conversation, involving an unidentified man bragging about how he violently head-butted his \"bitch\" ex, was captured by Awful Announcing.

After they had finished, Buck came back on the air as if nothing had happened. \n \n To cap Fox's freaky Friday, the audio cut out for eight minutes during its afternoon coverage from the historic course in Southampton, N.Y., on Long Island. To his credit, Buck handled the sound snafu with aplomb, noting: \"The reviews are in. We've never sounded better.\" \n \n During its first four years of USGA coverage, Fox has liberally sprinkled on-course microphones around the greens, tee boxes, fairways and galleries to bring viewers the sights and sounds of a U.S. Open. \n \n But Sporting News warned Thursday that some of the gavones in the loud, proud New York crowd would give Fox more audio than it could handle: \n \n \"It's hard to blame Fox for spectators running their yaps. That's more of a USGA issue. Most of us have been stuck in crowds with bozos who think they're hilarious, and crowds at major sporting events have become louder, drunker and more in-your-face over the years. Still, the mics picking up these gavones hurt the broadcast. As a viewer, I found it distracting to hear that stuff on nearly every hole, every shot.\" \n \n The next question is how the strait-laced, white-shoe crowd at the USGA will react to its premier event being sullied by Fox's X-rated, misogynistic audio. \n \n We'll see this weekend.",

(North Korean leader) King Jong Un and his family is a cult in North Korea.\" \n \n The Kim dynasty has ruled North Korea since its founding in 1948. Its three leaders \u2014 first Kim Il Sung, then Kim Jong Il and now Kim Jong Un \u2014 have inspired an intense, devotional following that has kept them in power. \n \n In her new book, North Korea: The Country We Love to Hate, political analyst Loretta Napoleoni described the isolated nation's ruling \"juche\" philosophy that values self-reliance and extreme nationalism \"as a modern religion, similar to Scientology, a non-transcendental doctrine with a twist of absurdity and plenty of dogmas.\" \n \n \"I have had the opportunity to speak to North Korean soldiers who have defected to South Korea \u2014 and you cannot imagine how indoctrinated they are,\" Chun said. \"These are people who have defected, and yet there is still an innate belief in their system which is close to ridiculous.\" \n \n North Korea: Is There A Military Option To Counter The Threat? \n \n Special guest speaker Lieutenant General (Ret.)

ChunFormer Commander, South Korea Special Warfare Command @Policy_Exchange \n \n #PXKoreapic.twitter.com/cA2lQ7MgkW \u2014 Elliott Franks (@elliottfranks) January 10, 2018 \n \n More: Trump open to talks with North Korea under 'right circumstances' \n \n More: U.S. debates giving North Korea 'bloody nose' with preemptive strike \n \n More: North Korea praises 'Fire and Fury' book for foretelling 'Trump\u2019s political demise' \n \n Chun, who retired 18 months ago after serving in South Korea's military for almost 40 years, rose as high as deputy commander of the First South Korean Army, a position that also involved leading the country's special forces. \n \n According to Chun, who lives just 35 miles from the North's border, here are some of the challenges that allied forces would face in the event of war: \n \n \u2022 The majority of the North's military infrastructure is deep underground, a reaction to the massive bombing by U.S. forces during the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with an armistice instead of a peace treaty. \n \n \u2022 Every North Korean, starting at age 14, gets 100 hours of training each year on how to shoot a weapon, fire a rocket-propelled grenade, throw a grenade, pitch a tent and other survival skills. \"North Korea is militarized far beyond the (West's) imagination,\" Chun said. \n \n \u2022 While the North Korean air force is significantly outdated with about 1,000 old fighter jets, these planes would be used for kamikaze-style attacks instead of air combat. \"They will load them with a lot of fuel, some bombs, and tell the pilot, 'That is your target and you need to destroy it,'\" he said. \n \n \u2022 The regime has chemical and biological weapons, which Chun estimates at between 2,500 and 5,000 tons. \n \n \u2022 North Korea has artillery and rockets that directly threaten the South Korean capital Seoul, one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world with a population of 25 million people. \n \n \u2022 The North's military has 1.3 million active members and 7.7 million reserves. It has 200,000 special forces, whose official name translates as \"monkey units,\" a reference, Chun said, to the \"doped-up disrupting role they would play\" in any conflict. \n \n \u2022 In case of a foreign attack or invasion, North Koreans would stay loyal to Kim in the immediate term. \"They have a system where five to 10 families are organized into a group, and if a single person from that group misbehaves, the entire five or 10 families go to the gulag or are executed. So everybody spies on everybody else. It is a great mechanism for keeping people under control,\" he said. \n \n Chun was also a national security adviser to South Korean President Moon Jae-in while he was running for office. Chun first gained prominence in South Korea in 1983 as a young lieutenant when he was credited with saving the life of a senior South Korean general during a terrorist bombing in Burma. Later, he became one of the most senior contact points for U.S. military commanders in South Korea. \n \n He gave his assessment of the threats facing Seoul and Washington amid reports, including in The Wall Street Journal, that despite an apparent easing in tensions after this week's talks between North and South Korea for the first time in two years, the Trump administration is still teetering between launching a pre-emptive strike on Pyongyang over its pursuit of nuclear weapons or holding out for diplomacy. \n \n \"A lot of good talks are going on \u2014 a lot of good energy. I like what I'm seeing,\" President Trump said Wednesday. North Korea agreed to send a delegation to next month\u2019s Winter Olympics in South Korea and to hold military talks aimed at easing front-line animosities. \n \n Still, Chun said Pyongyang was ready for war and was \"one huge barracks.\" \n \n He said North Korea's latest missile test in November indicated it has an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland, including Washington, D.C. \n \n \"But that\u2019s assuming it only has a 150kg warhead,\" Chun said. \"If it had a 500kg warhead \u2014 which is what we think it would need to have nuclear capability \u2014 it probably would not reach the capital. The North Koreans do not really have that capability, and this is where the window still exists for them to cease. If they want to broker a deal with the Americans, they need to do it now.\" \n \n Chun said that over the course of his military career he became convinced \"if you want peace, the only proven lesson is you must prepare for war. Yes, there is a military option for North Korea. But it\u2019s like having a toothache and having to pull out all of your teeth. It should be the last option \u2014 and heaven forbid we have to use it.\" \n \n More: Kim Jong Un says he has complete nuclear arsenal and a button on his desk \n \n More: No, Trump doesn't have a button to launch nuclear weapons. But, he does have a 'football' \n \n CLOSE North Korea agreed Tuesday to send a delegation to next month's Winter Olympics in South Korea, Seoul officials said, as the bitter rivals sat for rare talks at the border to discuss how to cooperate in Olympics and improve their long-strained ties. Time_Sports \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2D18liw ||||| But North Korea said it would not discuss its nuclear weapons because they were aimed only at the United States and not its \"brethren\" in South Korea, or Russia or China, showing that a diplomatic breakthrough to the global crisis remained far off. Chun is also a former national security adviser to South Korea's President Moon Jae-in when he was running for office. He first gained prominence in 1983 when as a young lieutenant he was credited with saving the life of a senior general during a terrorist bombing in Burma. Later, he became one of the most senior contact points for US military commanders in South Korea. When asked by Fairfax Media if the first talks in two years signalled any material change, Chun said his 39 years of military experience had taught him that South Korea needed to be ready because often the only proven pathway to peace is war. \"You must seek peace but at the same time prepare ourselves for the worst,\" he said. Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un have traded barbs recently, increasing tension between the two countries. Photo: AHN YOUNG-JOON \n \n But he said he was confident that, despite North Korea's nuclear and chemical weapons and cyber warfare capabilities, the United States would prevail. \"There is no doubt in any South Korean's mind that if there's war that the alliance will win and it's just the fact that the sheer air power that the Korean and the United States - with British aircraft - that will hopefully come to our aid, can inflict on the North Koreans,\" he said.

Kim Jong-un 'like Hitler' \n \n Chan said Kim views himself as akin to the Swedish royal family and is not crazy but is similar in temperament to Adolf Hitler. He said the Kim dynasty had created such a cult in North Korea, where citizens are indoctrinated, that ridding the country of the family would be less like deposing the late Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and more like trying to remove Allah in Muslim countries. \"Can you imagine what that would look like? Trying to get rid of Allah in Afghanistan or Iraq?\" Australia, Britain and the US have all named North Korea as the culprit behind the global WannaCry cyber attack that crippled the British health system and infected 300,000 computers across the world. Chan said Pyongyang's ability to hack systems worldwide should not be underestimated. \n \n \"North Korean cyber capability is right below nuclear capability in terms of threat.\" China prefers nuclear North to US in Asia North Korea ramped up missile launches last year and conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test, prompting a US-led campaign to impose some of the strongest international sanctions yet, which Pyongyang dubbed an \"act of war\". The international community, including Australia, has called on China to do more to contain North Korea. But Chan said Beijing had calculated that it would prefer a nuclear-armed North Korean neighbour than an increased US presence in its neighbourhood. \n \n Conservative MP and chairman of the British Parliament's influential foreign affairs committee, Tom Tugendhat\u200b, said Britain, Australia and the rest of the Commonwealth had a great stake in the Korean peninsula, although he cautioned against any direct British role in \"tipping the balance\". Tugendhat singled out Australia's high commissioner to Britain, Alexander Downer who attended the speech. \"It's very good to see you here representing the great Commonwealth,\" Tugendhat told Downer. \"We have this enormous shared trade culture but we actually have a lot more than that too that's less noticed,\" he said, adding that Australia and Britain were major investors in South Korean enterprises. \n \n But he said this was a secondary priority compared with Britain and Australia's interests in upholding the international rules-based order.

For proof of that, consider the following image comparing full-disk images captured by two NOAA satellites -- GOES-16 and GOES-13 -- at the same time on the same day: 1:07 p.m. EST on January 15, 2017. \n \n On the left is a color-composite full-disk image from NOAA's newest geostationary weather satellite GOES-16 (located at 89.5 degrees West longitude), which was created by combining data from the ABI's 16 spectral channels. By comparison, the imager aboard GOES-13 has just five spectral channels, and their data cannot be combined to produce color composites with this \"true color\" effect without the inclusion of additional data sets. \n \n In addition to offering more channels, the ABI can provide a full disk image of the Earth every 15 minutes, one of the continental U.S. every five minutes, and has the ability to target regional areas where severe weather, hurricanes, wildfires, volcanic eruptions or other high-impact environmental phenomena are occurring as often as every 30 seconds. ||||| Since the GOES-16 satellite lifted off from Cape Canaveral on November 19, scientists, meteorologists and ordinary weather enthusiasts have anxiously waited for the first photos from NOAA\u2019s newest weather satellite, GOES-16, formerly GOES-R. \n \n The release of the first images today is the latest step in a new age of weather satellites. It will be like high-definition from the heavens. \n \n The pictures from its Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) instrument, built by Harris Corporation, show a full-disc view of the Western Hemisphere in high detail \u2014 at four times the image resolution of existing GOES spacecraft. The higher resolution will allow forecasters to pinpoint the location of severe weather with greater accuracy. GOES-16 can provide a full image of Earth every 15 minutes and one of the continental U.S. every five minutes, and scans the Earth at five times the speed of NOAA\u2019s current GOES imagers. \n \n NOAA\u2019s GOES-16, situated in geostationary orbit 22,300 miles above Earth, will boost the nation\u2019s weather observation network and NOAA\u2019s prediction capabilities, leading to more accurate and timely forecasts, watches and warnings. \n \n \u201cThis is such an exciting day for NOAA!

Jerry Brown, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, and Assemblyman V. Manuel... (Associated Press) \n \n Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed the bill in front of a cheering crowd of immigrants and their supporters, predicting other parts of the country will follow the example set by the nation's most populous state. \n \n The licenses, which are expected to become available no later than January 2015, will carry a special designation on the front and a notice stating that the document is not official federal identification and cannot be used to prove eligibility for employment or public benefits. \n \n \"This is only the first step,\" Brown said outside City Hall in Los Angeles. \"When a million people without their documents drive legally and with respect in the state of California, the rest of this country will have to stand up and take notice. No longer are undocumented people in the shadows.\" \n \n Ten other states have enacted measures to give driver's licenses to immigrants in the country illegally, many of them in the past year, according to the National Immigration Law Center. \n \n Some of those states issue only one kind of license. But laws in many states, including Oregon and Colorado, create distinctions between the license given to immigrants and the one issued to other drivers. \n \n Some immigrant advocates initially raised concerns that a different license in California would contribute to racial profiling. The new law bans discrimination based on the license and states that the license cannot be used as a basis for arresting someone for being in the U.S. illegally. \n \n State Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg said he believes the marker is insignificant in relation to what the license will do for immigrants. \n \n \"Those distinctions mean little to hard-working people who simply want to drive to work or drive their kids to school or soccer practice without fear,\" he said. \n \n State officials estimate 1.4 million drivers will apply for licenses under the law during the first three years. The measure, written by Democratic Assemblyman Luis Alejo, will grant licenses to anyone who passes the written and road tests, regardless of immigration status. \n \n State and local officials touted the importance of getting immigrants properly trained and tested so that they know how to drive and are familiar with the rules of the road in California. \n \n \"That's what this bill is about, making the streets of this state safer,\" Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said. The bill had the backing of the state's Police Chiefs Association and insurance authorities. \n \n It isn't clear whether entities such as local government offices, libraries or banks will accept the license as identification. \n \n Over the past two decades, immigrant advocates have pushed to get licenses in California. The effort took on more urgency in recent years as immigrants caught driving without a license began seeing their cars impounded and wound up being screened by federal immigration authorities for deportation. \n \n Former state lawmaker and current Los Angeles City Councilman Gil Cedillo said he introduced the license bill 11 times over 15 years, but the measure failed to get enough votes or was vetoed or repealed. \n \n Cedillo said the license will bear a marker to comply with a federal identification law enacted after the 2001 terrorist attacks but that won't impede immigrants desperate to drive legally from applying for it. \n \n In the Legislature, opponents of the bill said granting a license with special markings would put employers and landlords in a conflict between complying with state and federal laws. \n \n The bill is one of several immigrant-friendly measures passed by the Legislature this year, including overtime pay for domestic workers and an effort to scale back collaboration between local law enforcement and federal immigration officials. \n \n Brown has enjoyed strong support among Latino voters, whose numbers are growing in California. On the steps of City Hall, scores of immigrant rights activists chanted \"champion\" in Spanish at the mention of his name. \n \n He urged lawmakers to move forward on more sweeping immigration reform on Capitol Hill, where an overhaul has stalled. \n \n Ismael Salvador, a 63-year-old factory worker from El Salvador, turned out to see the bill-signing. He said the change will radically alter the lives of his two daughters, who are in the country illegally. \n \n One risks driving every morning to her job as a lunch truck cook, and the other cleans houses and relies on rides because she is afraid to get behind the wheel, he said. ||||| Gov. Jerry Brown signed a landmark law Thursday granting driver's licenses to people who are in the country illegally, hailing the measure as an important expansion of immigrant rights and one that should serve as an example to other states. \n \n \"This is only the first step. When a million people without their documents drive legally with respect to the state of California, the rest of this country will have to stand up and take notice,\" Brown said outside Los Angeles City Hall, with Archbishop Jose Gomez and other dignitaries in attendance. \"No longer are undocumented people in the shadows.\" \n \n The licenses will bear distinguishing marks: The legislation recommends DP for driving privilege, rather than DL for driver's license. \n \n The new law will set off a scramble at the Department of Motor Vehicles, which may open up to six temporary offices to handle the estimated 1.4 million immigrants who are expected to apply in the next three years. \n \n Proponents say that with more licensed drivers, hit-and-run accidents will decrease and the percentage of drivers who are insured will increase. \n \n Ten other states have passed similar laws \u2014 seven of them this year \u2014 as comprehensive immigration reform remains stalled at the federal level. In the three states that already grant such licenses, the effect is being debated. \n \n A study in New Mexico found that the rate of insured drivers has increased only slightly. Republican Gov. Susana Martinez has advocated the repeal of the driver's license provision, arguing that out-of-state immigrants are flocking there and fraudulently obtaining licenses. Washington state has also seen multiple attempts to repeal its immigrant driver's licenses. \n \n Immigrant rights advocates predict that most people who are driving without licenses will come forward and apply. In Utah, people were initially scared, but about 75% to 80% ended up applying, said Tony Yapias of Proyecto Latino de Utah. \n \n \"For the last eight years, it has worked well in Utah,\" Yapias said. \"I tell the immigrant community in California to give it a chance. It will make things safe for everyone.\" \n \n California DMV officials will begin developing eligibility guidelines and the licenses probably won't be issued until late 2014 or early 2015. The legislation suggests using documents such as a passport, lease agreement or birth certificate to establish identity. \n \n State officials estimate that once guidelines are in place, processing the flood of applications will cost $140 million to $220 million in the first three years. The new applicants would collectively pay about $50 million under current fee structures, but the bill allows additional fees if necessary. \n \n California is home to nearly one in four immigrants who live in the U.S. without legal status. The state can learn a lot about potential problems from New Mexico, which has issued more than 90,000 driver's licenses to foreign nationals since 2003, said Demesia Padilla, that state's secretary for taxation and revenue. \n \n \"It's been a disaster,\" Padilla said. \"We have had a lot of identify fraud.\" \n \n The state has broken up fraud rings that used false addresses and fraudulent lease and utility documents to obtain driver's licenses for immigrants who live in other states, she said. \n \n One of the California bill's leading opponents, businessman Don Rosenberg of Westlake Village, said he is considering a possible legal challenge to the new law, which he called a \"sham.\" \n \n Rosenberg, whose 25-year-old son was killed in an accident with an unlicensed immigrant driver, testified at the Capitol in recent months against the legislation, criticizing it for not requiring any training or other measures to make sure the new drivers are safer. \n \n Police chiefs and sheriffs across California have generally backed the measure because the licenses are clearly distinguishable from standard ones. \n \n \"With this bill, over 1 million drivers in California will be more likely to have been tested, to have insurance or to know the rules of the road and obey the laws of this state,\" Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said Thursday. \n \n But in New Mexico, the law enforcement benefits touted by the licenses' proponents have not materialized, said Jim Burleson, executive director of the state's Sheriffs' and Police Assn. Burleson argues that immigrants should drive in the U.S. using driver's licenses from their home countries. \n \n \"Go get the license from where you come from,\" he said. \"There's nothing value-added having a person \u2026 get a license from that state if they're not from there.\" \n \n A 2011 study published in the Journal of Insurance Regulation suggested that in states that grant driver's licenses to such immigrants, the rate of uninsured motorists had increased by almost 2%, resulting in more fatal car crashes. \n \n In Utah, a 2006 state audit report showed that about 75% of those with the immigrant \"driving privilege cards\" had obtained car insurance, compared with 81% of those with regular licenses. \n \n Los Angeles City Councilman Gil Cedillo introduced a licensing bill every year during his two decades in the California Legislature. He said Thursday that the legislation was prompted by the seizure of unlicensed immigrants' cars. \n \n For Araceli Sanchez of West Los Angeles, a driver's license would allow her to get to her housecleaning and painting jobs without fear that her car will be impounded or that she will be deported. \n \n \"Driving without a license is a lot of fear,\" said Sanchez, 49, who came to the U.S. illegally from Oaxaca, Mexico, more than two decades ago. \"Every day when we go to our work or take our kids to school, we feel a menace following us.\" \n \n Angel Barrera said that all the immigrants in his Van Nuys apartment building are studying for the driver's license test using a Spanish-language smartphone app. \n \n \"You don't know what a difference this will make,\" Barrera said. \"We will be able to go everywhere we want now.\" \n \n cindy.chang@latimes.com \n \n richard.winton@latimes.com \n \n patrick.mcgreevy@latimes.com",

The correspondence included their conflicts in determining whether Manning should leave the priesthood to marry Kotowski. \n \n \"We're soul mates, and in any human relationship, especially one of over 30 years, you reach a decision-making \n \n Advertisement \n \n point, and our relationship reached that point,\" Kotowski said. \n \n Kotowski said she takes exception to media descriptions of her relationship with Manning as an \"affair\" because she believes theirs was a life-long commitment. \n \n \"It's a 30-year relationship of love for one another,\" she said. \"That's what it was.\" \n \n Kotowski, 59, and Manning, 70, are cousins on her mother's side, and did not grow up together, she said. Manning left for the seminary when he was 14, and she was 3. \n \n Kotowski attended Manning's ordination and first Mass, but their paths did not cross again until she was in her late 20s, she said. \n \n Both families know of their relationship and have even welcomed them at family gatherings, she said. \n \n \"My family knows him and loves Father Mike. My family knows of our closeness and our relationship, and they're very happy we have each other on our life journey. They know we're kindred spirits and soul mates.\" \n \n They are now embracing celibacy, Kotowski said, because she supports Manning's calling. \n \n \"It's a struggle, but we know God is calling to us, so we honor that,\" she said. \n \n Kotowski would not say how long the physical aspect of her relationship lasted, nor whether she has had other long-term relationships. She has never married and has no children. \n \n Kotowski said she is not concerned with how the revelations of her relationship with Manning will play out because she feels she has done nothing wrong or illegal. \n \n San Bernardino Sun staff writer Josh Dulanay contributed to this story. \n \n Claudia Mel\u00e9ndez Salinas can be reached at 753-6755 or cmelendez@montereyherald.com. \n \n \n \n \n \n",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Alastair Jamieson \n \n Russia has a new array of nuclear-capable weapons including an intercontinental ballistic missile that renders defense systems \u201cuseless,\u201d President Vladimir Putin announced Thursday. \n \n The ICBM has a longer range than any other and can reach almost any target in the world, Putin said in his annual address to lawmakers and political elites. \n \n Other new technologies he highlighted included supersonic missiles and drone submarines that he said cannot be stopped. \n \n Putin's marathon speech came 17 days before a presidential election in which he is seeking an unprecedented fourth term in power. It was accompanied by video footage showing some of the new weaponry in action as well as simulations on a giant screen. \n \n To rapturous applause, Putin said the new technology had been developed despite skepticism from other countries about Russia's capabilities. \n \n \"I want to tell all those who have fueled the arms race over the last 15 years, sought to win unilateral advantages over Russia, introduced unlawful sanctions aimed to contain our country's development ... you have failed to contain Russia,\" he said. \n \n He accused the West of \"ignoring us. Nobody listened to us. Well listen to us now.\" \n \n \"Russia\u2019s strong military is a guarantor of peace on our planet.\" \n \n He boasted that Russia's new ICBM is \u201cpowerful and modern and defense systems will not be able to withstand it,\u201d he said. \u201cMissile defenses will be useless against it.\u201d \n \n Other new weapons include the Avangard \u2014 an intercontinental hypersonic missile that would fly to targets at a speed 20 times the speed of sound \u2014 and a weapons system called Kinzhal, already deployed in southern Russia, that uses hypersonic missiles that can strike targets 1,250 miles away. \n \n Putin insisted Russia had \"no plans to be an aggressor.\" \n \n \"We are not going to take anything away from anybody. We have everything we need,\" he said. \"Russia\u2019s strong military is a guarantor of peace on our planet.\" \n \n However, he warned: \"Any use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its allies \u2026 any kind of attack \u2026 will be regarded as a nuclear attack against Russia and in response we will take action instantaneously no matter what the consequences are. Nobody should have any doubt about that.\" \n \n Paul Cheung / NBC News \n \n He added: \"Our policy will never be based on exceptionalism, we just protect our own interests.\" \n \n America's nuclear strategy had \"raised concerns in Russia,\" he said. \n \n The display of military prowess came at the end of Putin's state-of-the-nation speech, which lasted almost two hours and covered everything from health care to the annual grain harvest. \n \n Earlier, the leader pledged to improve the lives of Russians by cutting poverty by half, boosting pensions and creating more daycare places. He also called for spending on urban infrastructure to be doubled over the next six years. \n \n Journalists watch as Russian President Vladimir Putin gives his annual state of the nation address in Moscow on Thursday. Alexander Zemlianichenko / AP \n \n However, there was no detail on how his spending pledges would be funded. \n \n Polls suggest Putin, who has dominated Russian politics as president or prime minister for 18 years, is on track to comfortably secure another six-year term. \n \n He told lawmakers and members of the political elite that Russia had \"huge potential\" but needed to improve its living standards. \n \n \"We have not reached the necessary level in terms of people's well-being,\" he said. \n \n Some 20 million Russians \u2014 or almost one-in-seven people \u2014 are still living below the poverty line, Putin added, calling it \"unacceptable.\" \n \n Almost 70 percent of Russians are ready to support Putin in the March 18 election, according to a poll published Thursday by state news agency, TASS. \n \n There has been little in the way of campaigning, and opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been barred from running. He was arrested Jan. 28 moments before a protest march in Moscow. Navalny wants voters to boycott the election, hoping low turnout will take the shine off Putin\u2019s likely win. ||||| President says Russia has new line of nuclear-capable weapons that can breach US defences \n \n Vladimir Putin has announced that Russia has developed and is testing a new line of strategic nuclear-capable weapons that would be able to outmanoeuvre US defences, in a possible signal of a new arms race between Moscow and the west. \n \n Speaking in a nationally televised address to the country\u2019s political elite weeks before the presidential election, Putin showed video and animations of ICBMs, nuclear-powered cruise missiles, underwater drones and other weapons that he said Russia had developed as a result of the US pulling out of the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty signed with the Soviet Union. \n \n \n \n \u201cYou didn\u2019t listen to our country then,\u201d Putin said during the speech on Thursday. \u201cListen to us now.\u201d Some of the weapons were already being tested, he added. \n \n \n \n The existence of several of the weapons systems \u2013 like the RS-28 Sarmat, or Satan 2, nuclear missile \u2013 were well-known and their tests had been previously reported. What was new was Putin\u2019s portrayal of Russia\u2019s modernising arsenal as an adversarial response to US policy since 2001. \n \n \n \n Play Video 1:04 Putin presents new ballistic rocket, Sarmat - video \n \n The speech came in the same month that the Pentagon released a new nuclear arms policy, which followed a promise by the US president, Donald Trump, to develop an arsenal \u201cso strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression\u201d. The policy envisioned low-yield nuclear weapons on submarine-launched ballistic missiles that could match similar Russian weapons. \n \n \n \n Putin\u2019s message was one of defiance. \u201cI would like to tell those who have been trying to escalate the arms race for the past 15 years, to gain unilateral advantages over Russia, and to impose restrictions and sanctions \u2026 The attempt at curbing Russia has failed,\u201d he said. \n \n \n \n His remarks came during a state of the union speech heavy with economic promises for the Russian people and sabre-rattling against the US. It was widely viewed as his first campaign speech for Russia\u2019s presidential elections on 18 March. The Kremlin is primarily concerned with boosting turnout, as Putin is expected to cruise to a fourth term as president. \n \n \n \n Quick guide Hypersonic missiles and the 'doomsday torpedo' Show Hide Hypersonic glide weapons First mooted in the 1960s, hypersonic glide weapons are designed to fly at ultra-high speeds and at much lower altitudes than ballistic missiles, with the idea that they would be effectively undetectable by existing anti-missiles systems. Although the US was believed to be further advanced in its testing, Russia has been working hard on its Yu-74 hypersonic weapon which may become operational as early as 2020. China is among other countries believed to be pursuing the technology. The Russian version \u2013 part of a project called Objekt 4202 \u2013 was designed to counter both the Nato missile defence shield and the US's Thaad anti-missile system. It could fly from Moscow to London in around 13 minutes, armed with multiple nuclear warheads. One suggestion for delivery is that it may be launched from the new Russian Sarmat intercontinental missile system \u2013 due to come into service this year. The Yu-74 is planned to achieve its hypersonic speed, around Mach 10, by using gravity as it falls back to earth. The 'doomsday torpedo' Putin also mentioned a nuclear-armed underwater drone likely to be the Kanyon or Status-6. Described in some places as the Russian \u2018doomsday torpedo', its existence was confirmed earlier this year in a draft of the Pentagon\u2019s Nuclear Posture Review. Reportedly first detected by US intelligence in 2016, the submarine-launched autonomous vehicle can carry a 100 megaton nuclear warhead. It has a range of 6,200 miles, a top speed of over 56 knots and can descend to depths of 3,280 feet. \n \n There were signs that the authorities wanted to attract extra attention to the speech by moving it from the gilded St George\u2019s Hall at the Kremlin to an exhibition space in central Moscow where video and infographics could be shown. \n \n The first hour of the speech was conventional, if optimistic. Putin promised to raise life expectancy by 10 years, to increase Russia\u2019s GDP by 50% by 2025 and halve the poverty rate. He said Russia would have to latch on to a wave of technological advances or risk \u201cdrowning in that wave\u201d. \n \n The interactive presentation began with graphs showing birth rates and harvest totals in recent years, but it was mainly used as a platform to show off Russia\u2019s latest weaponry, some of it capable of delivering a nuclear strike anywhere in the world. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest The video screen shows the Kinzhal air missile system as Vladimir Putin (right) delivers his annual address. Photograph: Tass/Barcroft Images \n \n Putin highlighted a test of Russia\u2019s RS-28 Sarmat missile. According to state media, the intercontinental ballistic missile is able to fly 6,800 miles with a payload of 15 warheads, though the actual capabilities of the missile have not been shown. The Russian defence ministry said it had conducted a successful test launch in October, during which the missile had travelled 3,600 miles before hitting a target area in Russia\u2019s far east. \n \n Putin also said Russia had developed a working laser weapon, a hypersonic missile and a cruise missile powered by a nuclear reactor that could fly indefinitely. \n \n \n \n He said the plane-launched hypersonic missile, called Kinzhal or dagger, could manoeuvre while travelling at more than 10 times the speed of sound, making it \u201cguaranteed to overcome all existing and I think prospective anti-missile systems\u201d and deliver a nuclear strike. Putin claimed it had completed testing and was already in use. \n \n He also spoke about the RS-26 ballistic missile, Avangard, which Putin said \u201cheads towards its target like a meteorite\u201d. The missile has already raised concerns in the US about its compliance with global arms treaties. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Putin delivers his annual address to the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation. Photograph: Tass/Barcroft Images \n \n Putin showed several animated videos of prototype weapons, including a nuclear-powered cruise missile that theoretically has a limitless range. He showed it navigating anti-air defences in the Atlantic Ocean before skirting the coast around South America and heading for the California coastline before the video faded to black. \n \n \n \n After each demonstration, the crowd applauded. \n \n The Pentagon played down Putin\u2019s speech, saying Moscow\u2019s weaponry had already been factored into US assessments. \u201cWe\u2019re not surprised by the statements and the American people should rest assured that we are fully prepared,\u201d said spokeswoman Dana White. \n \n US officials say American missile defence systems are not aimed at Moscow, but are instead designed to defend against threats from Iran, North Korea and other potential adversaries. \n \n Russia has been aggressively marketing its latest military technology. Its first stealth fighter, the Su-57, was deployed to Syria for combat testing last week. Analysts said the jet\u2019s capabilities were still not clear, and that the deployment could be designed to show the Su-57 programme was moving forward despite time and cost overruns. \n \n \n \n In a nod to public opinion, Putin announced an online contest to name Russia\u2019s new cruise missile and underwater drone. \n \n Putin has given the constitutionally mandated speech on \u201cthe situation in the country\u201d 14 times since he first became president in 2000. He did not do so during the four years he was prime minister. \n \n His address, which generally lasts around an hour, is given to an audience of lawmakers from the state Duma and federation council, judges, ministers and other members of the political establishment, and generally focuses on domestic issues such as the economy and corruption. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Putin introduced video of a missile launch \n \n Russia has developed a new array of nuclear weapons that are invincible, according to President Vladimir Putin. \n \n Mr Putin made the claims as he laid out his key policies for a fourth presidential term, ahead of an election he is expected to win in 17 days' time. \n \n The weapons he boasted of included a cruise missile that he said could \"reach anywhere in the world\". \n \n He said of the West: \"They need to take account of a new reality and understand ... [this]... is not a bluff.\" \n \n Giving his annual state of the nation speech, Mr Putin used video presentations to showcase the development of two new nuclear delivery systems that he said could evade detection. One video graphic appeared to show missiles raining down on the US state of Florida. \n \n One system Mr Putin described included a \"low-flying, difficult-to-spot cruise missile... with a practically unlimited range and an unpredictable flight path, which can bypass lines of interception and is invincible in the face of all existing and future systems of both missile defence and air defence\". \n \n Another was a submarine-launched, long-range missile capable of delivering a nuclear warhead. \n \n During the two-hour televised speech to a joint sitting of both houses of parliament, he said the weapons were a response to US development of its missile defence system. \n \n The US State Department said it was \"certainly unfortunate to have watched the video animation that depicted a nuclear attack on the United States\" - adding that it was not \"the behaviour of a responsible international player\". \n \n Opposition leader barred from vote \n \n Mr Putin faces seven challengers on 18 March, although none is expected to attract widespread support. The president played no part in a raucous televised debate broadcast on Wednesday that featured the other candidates. \n \n Absent from the campaign is prominent opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has been barred from running and has called on voters to boycott the poll. \n \n President Putin has so far done little campaigning, and until now has said little about his plans for the next six years. \n \n Wowing his audience \n \n By Steven Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow \n \n Before today, Vladimir Putin had delivered 13 state of the nation addresses. Address Number 14 turned out to be very different from anything that had come before. \n \n Standing in front of a giant video screen, President Putin showcased Russia's very latest strategic weapons. Like a magician pulling one rabbit after another out of his hat, he wowed his audience with images of cruise missiles, intercontinental ballistic missiles, underwater drones and supersonic jets. \n \n Russian MPs and senators applauded the military video show, which dominated the second half of President Putin's speech. \n \n There was a double message here. Firstly, to the West: don't push us. And, with elections coming up, there was this for the Russian people: Vote for Putin and you'll be voting for national security. \n \n I suspect the concluding image was designed to reinforce just that: as Vladimir Putin stood to the national anthem, a giant Russian flag appeared on the video screen behind him. It is a message that is likely to strike a chord with many here. \n \n Fighting poverty \n \n Mr Putin tailored the first half of his speech towards working Russians and their concerns. \n \n He pledged to halve poverty in the country within the next six years and said he wanted life-expectancy rates to emulate Japan and France. \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption It was Mr Putin's last speech before the election \n \n \"Every person matters to us,\" he said, adding that he also wanted to increase employment and longevity. \n \n In 2000 there were 42 million people in Russia living below the poverty line, he noted; today there were 20 million, but this still needed to come down. \n \n He warned Russians not to take the country's power for granted. \n \n \"Russia is now a leading country with a powerful foreign economic and defence potential,\" he said. \n \n \"But from the point of view of the extremely important task of ensuring people's quality of life and welfare we, of course, have not achieved the level we require. But we have to do this and will do this,\" he added to applause. \n \n Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president \n \n Mr Putin also pledged to spend more on roads and reduce accidents; said teachers deserved good salaries and wages; and said there should be better access to both the internet and medical services for people in remote areas. \n \n How credible are weaponry claims? \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption One of the video graphics appeared to show missiles dropping on the US state of Florida \n \n Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence correspondent \n \n President Putin's emphasis on a strong Russia modernising its nuclear arsenal is a reflection of similar statements over recent months from his US counterpart Donald Trump. \n \n In his remarks, Mr Putin highlighted the development of two new nuclear delivery systems, which, he said, could evade US anti-ballistic missile defences. \n \n This is essentially because neither of them are ballistic missiles, which are fired out of the atmosphere in a high-arcing trajectory. \n \n One - effectively a very long-range nuclear-tipped torpedo - has been rumoured to be under development since Soviet days but is now seen by US analysts as a credible threat. \n \n The second system - described by Mr Putin as a cruise missile - looks to be more of a work in progress and may be a kind of very high-speed \"hypersonic\" system - described by one arms control expert as a \"glider on steroids\" - that again could evade existing anti-missile defences. \n \n China and the US are also working on similar systems of their own. \n \n Technology and security \n \n Digital growth was also essential, Mr Putin said during his speech. He said he wanted Russia to become one of the world's main hubs for storing and processing big data. \n \n Image copyright EPA Image caption Graphics - including this one on Russia's working-age population (in millions) - flashed up throughout \n \n He called for more progress in making robots and artificial intelligence. New talent in technology should be nurtured and foreigners should be encouraged to study in Russia, he said. \n \n Mr Putin also spoke of Russian operations in Syria - supporting the Assad government's fight against rebels - which, he said, showed off the country's increased defence capabilities. \n \n Russia recently sent two of its most advanced fighter planes, Su-57s, to Syria, even though they are still undergoing tests. \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption There was no confirmation that Russia's new stealth fighters have been used in combat in Syria \n \n Mr Putin also announced that a bridge to the Crimean peninsula would be open within the next couple of months. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, during Mr Putin's current term in office. \n \n Russia was safeguarding its interest in the Arctic region by strengthening its military infrastructure in the region, he said.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Vladimir Putin's annual speech to lawmakers Thursday contained what appears to be a jarring threat to the US and the rest of the world: Russia has a new, \"invincible\" missile that can go anywhere and cannot be stopped, he said. A video graphic behind Putin showed a missile taking off from Russia, zooming across the Atlantic to South America, then turning north toward the US, reports the Washington Post. \"I hope everything that has been said today will sober any potential aggressor,\" Putin said, without naming names. He added that Russia had developed the nuclear-capable weapon, which \"missile defenses will be useless against,\" despite skepticism about Moscow's abilities. \"Nobody listened to us,\" he said, per NBC News. \"Well listen to us now.\" Putin, who asserted that Moscow has \"no plans to be an aggressor,\" also said Russia had a new underwater drone capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, reports the AP. And he declared that any use of nuclear weapons against one of its allies\u2014again, he did not mention specific nations\u2014would be considered a nuclear attack on Russia and that Moscow would respond in kind. All in all, the two-hour speech suggested \"a new arms race\" between Russia and the West, observes the Guardian. The speech comes less than three weeks before Putin is expected to easily win another six-year term, reports the BBC. He used much of the address to focus on economic reforms, promising among other things to reduce the rate of poverty by half in the next six years.",

But Arnold Schwarzenegger's hosting debut wasn't enough to give the network a ratings win for the show's premiere. \n \n The latest iteration of Comcast-owned NBC's Apprentice reality TV franchise\u2014which featured now president-elect Donald Trump as host for more than a decade\u2014lost the ratings battle with rival networks ABC and CBS ( cbs ) during the 8 p.m. ET primetime slot on Monday night.

    "document": "A boy in Canada mysteriously became allergic to fish and nuts after he received a blood transfusion, according to a new case report. \n \n The 8-year-old boy had no history of being allergic to any foods, and was undergoing treatment for medulloblastoma, a type of brain cancer. A few weeks after receiving a blood transfusion, he experienced a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis within 10 minutes of eating salmon, according to the report, published online today (April 7) in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. \n \n His doctors suspected that the blood transfusion had triggered the reaction, they wrote in the report. After treating the patient with a drug containing antihistamines, the doctors advised him to avoid fish and to carry an epinephrine injector in case he had another reaction. [9 Weirdest Allergies] \n \n But four days later, the boy was back in the emergency department after eating a chocolate peanut butter cup. Blood tests and a skin prick test suggested that he was allergic \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 to peanuts and salmon, so his doctors advised him to avoid nuts and fish. \n \n \"It's very rare to have an allergic reaction to a previously tolerated food,\" said the report's senior author, Dr. Julia Upton, a specialist in clinical immunology and allergy at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. \"The overall idea is that he wasn't allergic to these foods,\" but in the blood transfusion, he received the protein that triggers an allergic reaction to them, she said. \n \n That protein, called immunoglobulin E, is an antibody associated with food allergies, Upton said. When it encounters a specific allergen, it causes immune cells to release chemicals such as histamine that lead to an allergic reaction. \n \n A skin-prick test given to the 8-year-old child showing that he has acquired reactions to peanut, tree nut mix, fish mix and salmon. Credit: Reproduced with permission from the Canadian Medical Association. \n \n However, because the boy's body itself did not make such antibodies against fish and nuts, his doctors said they suspected his allergies would go away within a few months. \n \n Acquiring allergies from a blood donor is rare, but not without precedent. The researchers found two other case reports, both in adults, in which patients acquired temporary allergies from blood plasma. In a 2007 case, an 80-year-old woman had an anaphylactic reaction to peanuts. An investigation showed that her 19-year-old plasma donor had a peanut allergy, according to the report in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine. \n \n In the new case, the 8-year-old also received plasma, the liquid part of blood that contains antibodies. The researchers inquired about the donor to Canadian Blood Services, and found that the donor did have an allergy to nuts, fish and shellfish. The service did not have any more blood from the donor, and subsequently excluded the individual from making future donations, the researchers said. \n \n About five months later, blood tests showed that the boy's immunoglobulin E levels to salmon and peanut were undetectable. By six months, his parents had gradually and successfully reintroduced nuts and fish back into their son's diet. \n \n However, Upton said, \"In general, we would recommend that this be done under medical supervision,\" just in case there is a medical emergency. \n \n It's unclear how doctors could prevent future cases, she said. Neither Canadian nor American blood service organizations bar people with allergies from donating blood. And testing donated blood for levels of immunoglobulin E doesn't always predict allergies. Some people with high levels of immunoglobulin E don't have allergies, and others with low levels of the protein do, she said. \n \n \"Clearly, the safety of the [blood] supply is of everyone's utmost concern,\" but more research is needed to determine how best to avoid the transfer of allergies, and how frequently this happens, Upton said. \n \n \"I think it's hard to make sweeping recommendations based on one case report,\" Upton said. \n \n In the United States, \"If a donor is feeling well and healthy on the day of donation, they are typically eligible to donate,\" said Dr. Courtney Hopkins, the acting chief medical officer for the east division of the American Red Cross. \"We will defer donors on the day of donation if they are not feeling well and healthy, if they have a fever, or if we notice they have problems breathing through their mouth.\" \n \n Donors can learn more about blood-donation eligibility here. Individuals with allergies shouldn't be dissuaded from donating, Hopkins added. \n \n \"We always need blood. We always need blood donors,\" Hopkins told Live Science. \n \n Follow Laura Geggel on Twitter @LauraGeggel. Follow Live Science @livescience, Facebook & Google+.

Not so for an eight-year-old boy who received a blood transfusion unexpectedly brimming with antibodies against salmon and peanuts\u2014two foods he had routinely consumed in the past. A few weeks after receiving transfusions, when he had a serious allergic reaction within 10 minutes of eating salmon and another after he ate a chocolate peanut butter cup, his doctors soon identified the source of the problem. Although transfusion-borne allergies are not unheard of, they are extremely rare. \n \n \n \n \u201cAllergies are so common in the population so we would anticipate that the rate of such events might be higher, and yet they have only been documented a few times in the literature,\u201d says Julia Upton, an allergist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto who wrote about this incident in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. In prior donor-linked allergy cases, a patient developed new allergies to foods, drugs or other allergens like grass following a transfusion from a donor who harbored such allergies. Fortunately, each time the allergies were short-lived and dissipated after several months because the patients did not produce the allergen antibodies themselves. With this patient, too, the allergies faded over several months. \n \n \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve had two such cases reported to Canadian Blood Services in the past decade, and we distribute over a million blood components for transfusion every year,\u201d says Robert Skeate, Canadian Blood Services\u2019 associate medical director for eastern Canada. But even though the transference of allergen antibodies via transfusion is apparently rare, the principle behind it makes sense. Clinicians purposefully transfer antibodies to give patients protection against infections, so it is not surprising that other antibodies could be transferred and cause ripple effects, Upton says. Large amounts of immunoglobulin-E (IgE) antibodies remain in blood products even after storage of more than a month. Typically, fresh frozen plasma will contain the largest amount of the antibodies, followed by platelets and then red cells because all three blood components contain plasma, which can contain antibodies. \n \n \n \n Still, multiple events must come together for a patient to have this rare allergic reaction. First, the blood donor must have high levels of IgE antibodies\u2014those that react against allergens. Second, a substantial amount of blood product must be given to the patient. Then, in order to detect the new allergy, the patient would have to be exposed to the specific allergen the antibodies would react against within a few months of receiving the transfusion. That window is tight, because passively acquired antibodies will naturally fade after a few months and the transient allergy will disappear. IgE is estimated to have a half-life of just a few hours or days, but once it enters the body and binds to cells, it can remain detectable for weeks or months and cause allergic reactions. \n \n \n \n Blood donors in the U.S. and Canada are not usually screened for allergies or asked to defer donation if they have a history of allergy. With this case, Canadian Blood Services officials traced the problematic blood product back to a donor with several allergies, checked to see if any more of that person\u2019s blood was in the donor pool (it was not) and barred that person from making future donations. This incident provided \u201csufficient reason to think it may happen again in the future,\u201d so Canadian Blood Services took this step as a precaution, Skeate says. \n \n \n \n Typically, blood donors are only asked if they are currently experiencing any allergy symptoms at the time of donation (and asked not to donate if the answer is \u201cyes\u201d). That protocol makes sense, Upton says. Even if donors submitted to allergy blood tests, the results would not be definitive\u2014they could pick up high levels of IgE antibodies but that person, or any recipients of their blood, may not have any actual reaction to the allergens in the real world. With that in mind, Upton and her co-authors are not calling for any changes in blood donation policy. \u201cIt would be very difficult to reduce the risk of such a rare reaction without substantial blood donor loss, and that\u2019s one reason the policy is the way it is,\u201d she says. Still, if doctors are on the lookout for the development of allergies after a blood transfusion, then the field will likely get a better sense of how common this effect is, she says.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 An 8-year-old boy in Canada never had any problems eating salmon or peanuts. Then, within just a few weeks of getting a blood transfusion as part of his treatment for brain cancer, he ate salmon and experienced a severe allergic reaction within 10 minutes. The same thing happened when he ate a chocolate peanut butter cup four days later. Doctors determined he was suffering from transfusion-borne allergies, and wrote about it in the Canadian Medical Association Journal. A piece in Scientific American calls the case \"extremely rare.\" But with allergies so common, why is that, well, the case? Such a reaction can only occur if three factors are in place, explains Scientific American. The donor must first have high levels of the type of immunoglobulin-E (IgE) antibodies that set off allergic reactions. The patient must then receive a significant amount of that blood and, within a few months, be exposed to the allergen the IgE antibodies would react to. That's because\u2014in good news for this 8-year-old and others like him\u2014the IgE antibodies eventually disappear from the blood because the recipients don't produce the same antibodies on their own. In this case, the boy was again eating fish and peanut butter six months later. Scientific American points out that antibody-transfer is usually a good thing, as it helps guard against infection. And avoiding a situation like this is tough, LiveScience reports. Having allergies doesn't disqualify would-be donors (in either the US or Canada), and having a high level of IgE in the blood doesn't always correlate with experiencing allergies.

    "document": "The American Cancer Society Guidelines for the Prevention and Early Detection of Cervical Cancer \n \n The American Cancer Society recommends that women follow these guidelines to help find cervical cancer early. Following these guidelines can also find pre-cancers, which can be treated to keep cervical cancer from forming. All women should begin cervical cancer testing (screening) at age 21. Women aged 21 to 29, should have a Pap test every 3 years. HPV testing should not be used for screening in this age group (it may be used as a part of follow-up for an abnormal Pap test). \n \n Beginning at age 30, the preferred way to screen is with a Pap test combined with an HPV test every 5 years. This is called co-testing and should continue until age 65. \n \n Another reasonable option for women 30 to 65 is to get tested every 3 years with just the Pap test. \n \n Women who are at high risk of cervical cancer because of a suppressed immune system (for example from HIV infection, organ transplant, or long-term steroid use) or because they were exposed to DES in utero may need to be screened more often. They should follow the recommendations of their health care team. \n \n Women over 65 years of age who have had regular screening in the previous 10 years should stop cervical cancer screening as long as they haven\u2019t had any serious pre-cancers (like CIN2 or CIN3) found in the last 20 years (CIN stands for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and is discussed later in the section Work-up of an abnormal Pap test result under the heading How biopsy results are reported). Women with a history of CIN2 or CIN3 should continue to have testing for at least 20 years after the abnormality was found. \n \n Women who have had a total hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and cervix) should stop screening (such as Pap tests and HPV tests), unless the hysterectomy was done as a treatment for cervical pre-cancer (or cancer). Women who have had a hysterectomy without removal of the cervix (called a supra-cervical hysterectomy) should continue cervical cancer screening according to the guidelines above. \n \n Women of any age should NOT be screened every year by any screening method. \n \n Women who have been vaccinated against HPV should still follow these guidelines. Some women believe that they can stop cervical cancer screening once they have stopped having children. This is not true. They should continue to follow American Cancer Society guidelines. Although annual (every year) screening should not be done, women who have abnormal screening results may need to have a follow-up Pap test (sometimes with a HPV test) done in 6 months or a year. The American Cancer Society guidelines for early detection of cervical cancer do not apply to women who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer, cervical pre-cancer, or HIV infection. These women should have follow-up testing and cervical cancer screening as recommended by their health care team. Importance of being screened for cervical cancer \n \n Cervical cancer was once one of the most common causes of cancer death for American women. The cervical cancer death rate dropped significantly with the increased use of the Pap test for screening. But the death rate has not changed much over the last 15 years. \n \n Screening tests offer the best chance to have cervical cancer found early when successful treatment is likely. Screening can also actually prevent most cervical cancers by finding abnormal cervical cell changes (pre-cancers) so that they can be treated before they have a chance to turn into a cervical cancer. ||||| (CNN) The risk of dying from cervical cancer might be much higher than experts previously thought, and women are encouraged to continue recommended cancer screenings. \n \n Black women are dying from cervical cancer at a rate 77% higher than previously thought, and white women are dying at a rate 47% higher, according to a study published in the journal Cancer on Monday. \n \n The study found that previous estimates of cervical cancer death rates didn't account for women who had their cervixes removed in hysterectomy procedures, which eliminates the risk of developing the cancer. \n \n \"Prior calculations did not account for hysterectomy because the same general method is used across all cancer statistics,\" said Anne Rositch, assistant professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore and lead author of the study. \n \n That method is to measure cancer's impact across a total population without accounting for factors outside of gender, she said. \n \n There were about 12,990 new cases of cervical cancer in the United States last year and 4,120 cervical cancer deaths, according to the National Cancer Institute \n \n 'A better understanding of the magnitude' \n \n JUST WATCHED Study: Lifestyle has a bigger role in causing cancer Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Study: Lifestyle has a bigger role in causing cancer 01:41 \n \n The data were limited to only 12 states in the country, but the researchers noted that the data still provided a nationally representative sample of women. \n \n Then, the researchers collected data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System on how many women in 2000 to 2012, 20 and older, reported ever having a hysterectomy. They used that data to adjust the cervical cancer deaths rates. \n \n Before the adjustment, the data showed that the cervical cancer killed about 5.7 out of 100,000 black women and 3.2 per 100,000 white women. After adjusting for hysterectomies, the rate was 10.1 per 100,000 black women and 4.7 per 100,000 white women. \n \n The data showed that the racial disparity seen in cervical cancer death rates for black and white women was underestimated by 44% when hysterectomies were not taken into account. \n \n \"We can't tell from our study what might be contributing to the differences in cervical cancer mortality by age and race,\" Rositch said. \"Now that we have a better understanding of the magnitude of the problem, we have to understand the reasons underlying the problem.\" \n \n JUST WATCHED Protecting your kids from HPV Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Protecting your kids from HPV 02:18 \n \n Cervical cancer is highly preventable in the United States because of the availability of screening tests and a vaccine to prevent human papillomavirus, or HPV, which can cause cervical cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n \n \"Racial disparity may be explained by lack of access or limited access to cervical cancer screening programs among black women when compared to whites,\" said Dr. Marcela del Carmen, a gynecologic oncologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, who was not involved in the new study. \n \n \"This gap and disparity need to be addressed with initiatives focusing on better access to prevention or screening programs, better access to HPV vaccination programs and improved access and adherence to standard of care treatment for cervical cancer,\" she said. \n \n The new findings add to the current understanding of cervical cancer's impact on different communities, said Dr. John Farley, a practicing gynecologic oncologist and professor at Creighton University School of Medicine at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Arizona. \n \n \"It lets us know that there is substantial work to do to investigate and alleviate the racial minority disparity in cervical cancer in the US,\" said Farley, who was not involved in the study but co-authored an editorial about the new findings in the journal Cancer on Monday. \n \n \"Those who get cancer, many times, do not have access to screening,\" he said. \n \n Even though cervical cancer mortality rates are higher than previously thought, Farley said that he thinks the current screening recommendations for cervical cancer are still adequate. However, he added, more women should have access to screenings and other preventive measures. \n \n Rositch said, \"It may be that some women are not obtaining screening according to our current guidelines, not necessarily that guideline-based care is insufficient.\" \n \n How to prevent and screen for cervical cancer \n \n The American Cancer Society recommends that women begin cervical cancer screenings at age 21 by having a Pap test every three years. Then, beginning at 30, women should have a Pap test combined with a HPV test every five years. However, the recommendations are not universal among all expert groups. \n \n Symptoms of cervical cancer tend to not appear until the cancer has advanced, which is why screening and HPV vaccinations are urged. \n \n \"We have a vaccine which can eliminate cervical cancer, like polio, that is currently available, and only 40% of girls age 13 to 17 have been vaccinated,\" said Farley, co-author of the editorial. \"This is an epic failure of our health care system in taking care of women in general and minorities specifically.\" \n \n Women over 65 might not need to continue screening if they don't have a history of cervical cancer or negative Pap test results, according to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n \n Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. \n \n A study published in the journal JAMA Oncology last week found that among a group of 1,868 men in the United States, about 45% had genital HPV infections and only about 10% had been vaccinated. \n \n \"Male HPV vaccination may have a greater effect on HPV transmission and cancer prevention in men and women than previously estimated,\" the researchers wrote in that study. ||||| The death rate from cervical cancer in the United States is considerably higher than previously estimated and the disparity in death rates between black women and white women is significantly wider, according to a study published Monday in the journal Cancer. \n \n The rate at which black American women are dying from the disease is comparable to that of women in many poor developing nations, researchers reported. What makes the findings especially disturbing, said experts not involved in the research, is that when screening guidelines and follow-up monitoring are pursued, cervical cancer is largely preventable. \n \n \u201cThis shows that our disparities are even worse than we feared,\u201d said Dr. Kathleen M.

For white women, the rate was 47% higher. \"This shows that our disparities are even worse than we feared,\u201d Dr. Kathleen M. Schmeler tells the Times. New research in the journal Cancer excluded from death rates women who had undergone hysterectomies; previous research had included them even though they were not at risk because their cervixes were removed.

For black women, the news was shockingly bad, with 10.1 per 100,000 dying of cervical cancer (compared to 4.7 for white women), a rate seen in underdeveloped countries, per the Times. Reasons for the racial disparity included poor access to screenings and the HPV vaccine. Experts said screening options must be expanded for at-risk women, and warned that the gap could widen if the Affordable Care Act is repealed and women's health clinics shuttered. While screenings work well, \"many women in America are not getting them,\" says Schmeler.

The biggest Powerball drawing in history now stands at half a billion dollars, the biggest Powerball prize ever -- and the second-largest lottery jackpot in history. \n \n And that pot could get even sweeter by the time they pick the numbers. \n \n With no Powerball winner since October 6, lottery officials estimate that 105,000 tickets are being sold every minute nationwide. And the more tickets people buy, the more that jackpot will go up. \n \n Powerball at $500 million: What to do if you win \n \n The odds of winning the jackpot are just one in 175,000,000. \n \n But that isn't stopping players from trying their luck. From New York to Arizona, people stood in line Tuesday after the jackpot soared to $500 million. \n \n The historic prize is part of a plan lottery officials put in place earlier this year, including doubling the ticket price to $2 in order to boost jackpots faster. By the time of the drawing, lottery officials estimate that Americans will have purchased more than $1 billion in Powerball tickets. There is a 60 percent chance the winning combinations will have been sold. \n \n Asked if that means there will be a winner, Mary Newbauer, a lottery official told CBS News, \"I don't know. We'll have to wait and see, but that's not really a high number when it comes to drawings like this.\" \n \n Mary and Brian Lohse know what it's like to hit it big. The couple won $202 million in Powerball just two months ago. \n \n Mary Lohse said they didn't think they could actually win. Brian Lohse added, \"The fact that it was a single winner I think was -- it even makes it more astounding and mind-boggling for us.\" \n \n It's mind-boggling because Mary Lohse only bought that ticket as an afterthought at a local gas station one day. Before that, she and her husband were just trying to make ends meet for their three children. \n \n Brian Lohse said, \"We've faced the foreclosure. We've gotten the letter about them picking up the car and, frankly, right before we won the lottery.\" \n \n The couple immediately got a lawyer and financial advisers. Then something happened that they didn't expect -- they got dozens of letters from complete strangers asking for help. One letter they received said, \"If you could make an individual donation via check for an amount of $500,000 that would be very generous.\" \n \n The couple hasn't answered the letters, but they have shared their fortune with their community, planning to help the local high school build a new football stadium. \n \n For now, the family is still just trying to get over the shock of going from middle-class to millionaires. Mary Lohse said, \"I think we both, at some point in the middle of the night have woken up and going, 'Brian, did it really happen? And he says, 'Yes,' and then I go back to sleep.\" \n \n And if you're wondering whether the Lohses still play the the lottery the answer also is yes. Since winning Powerball, they've purchased a ticket every week, including one for tonight. \n \n If there is a single winner in tonight's drawing, that person could take a cash option of $327 million before taxes. \n \n For Manuel Bojorquez's full report on Powerball and the Lohses' life after their win, watch the video above. \n \n But if you do win the big prize, what should you do? \n \n Watch CBS News legal analyst Jack Ford's advice on \"CBS This Morning\" in the video below. \n \n You should get a team of financial advisers and lawyers to help you manage your financial future, Ford advised on \"CTM.\" He said, \"At this point, guys, can you afford to bring in some people who can provide you with some good advice. Just because somebody says, 'My next door neighbor's brother-in-law is a lawyer you should talk to him.' Make sure you find yourself a good lawyer, good financial analyst and take their advice very early on.\" \n \n Also, wait to claim your money, according to Ford. \"It's a good idea,\" he said. \"You got to do a couple of things. First thing do you is sign the ticket. ... The reason is it's the ticket that's the winner. You want to make sure that there's no question. There's a lot of people that would love to get their hands on that ticket. Sign it, put it in a safe place. The safe place is not a shoe box in your closet. Get to your local bank. ...Take some time to settle in, get your team in place, make sure you know what's going on here, get the advice.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Maggie Fox \n \n A pineapple pesticide that made its way into milk in Hawaii also made its way into men\u2019s brains, and those men were more likely to develop Parkinson\u2019s disease, a new study finds. \n \n It\u2019s the latest in a very long series of studies linking various pesticides to Parkinson\u2019s, which is caused by the loss of certain brain cells. \n \n And the study also seems to support a mystifying observation: smokers seem to be protected against Parkinson\u2019s. \n \n For the study, Dr. Robert Abbott of the Shiga University of Medical Science in Otsu, Japan, and colleagues studied 449 Japanese-American men living in Hawaii who were taking part in a larger study of aging. They gave details of how much milk they drank as part of a larger survey, and they donated their brains for study after they died. \n \n \u201cFor people living with Parkinson's, understanding the impact of environmental factors is crucial.\" \n \n The men who drank more than 16 ounces of milk a day had the fewest brain cells in a part of the brain called the substantia nigra, which is damaged in Parkinson\u2019s, they reported in the journal Neurology. \n \n The researchers also looked for the pesticide heptachlor, which was taken off the market for most uses in the U.S. in 1988. \n \n \"Among those who drank the most milk, residues of heptachlor epoxide were found in nine of 10 brains as compared to 63.4 percent for those who consumed no milk,\" the researchers wrote. \n \n It\u2019s known the milk in Hawaii was contaminated, probably from the feed given to the cattle. \"The researchers could not test whether the milk the men drank was contaminated with pesticides (heptachlor, in this case), and no one knows how long or how widespread the contamination was before being detected,\" the Parkinson\u2019s Disease Foundation said in a statement on its website. \n \n \"The potential link between drinking milk, pesticides and development of Parkinson\u2019s disease needs further investigation,\" the foundation said. \n \n The men who smoked and who also drank milk showed none of the brain cell loss. \n \n \"This study is unique because it brings together two critical but different pieces of information \u2014 environmental exposure and physical changes in the brain \u2014 to understand potential contributors of Parkinson\u2019s disease,\" James Beck, vice president of scientific affairs at the Parkinson's Disease Foundation, said in a statement. \n \n \u201cThe potential link between drinking milk, pesticides and development of Parkinson\u2019s disease needs further investigation.\u201d \n \n \"For people living with Parkinson's, understanding the impact of environmental factors is crucial as nearly 85 percent have no idea why they developed Parkinson\u2019s. There is no clear genetic link,\" Beck said. \n \n The Parkinson's Disease Foundation estimates that 1 million Americans have the condition, marked by tremor, rigid muscles and problems with movement. There is no cure, although early treatment can delay the worst symptoms. \n \n \"For scientists, the opportunity to study brains generously donated by the participants of this study was crucial to establishing a potential link between different environmental exposures and Parkinson\u2019s, and will be crucial to solving the disease overall,\" Beck said. ||||| A pesticide that was present in milk in the early 1980s may be linked to signs of Parkinson's disease that are showing up in people today, according to a new study. \n \n The researchers looked at Japanese-American men in Hawaii, where the pesticide was frequently used, and found that those who drank more than two cups of milk daily at the start of the study had 40 percent fewer brain cells in an area of the brain called the substantia nigra 30 years later, on average, compared with similar men who drank less than two cups of milk per day. \n \n The loss of brain cells in this area of the brain may be an early sign of Parkinson's disease, and can start decades before any visible symptoms of the disease occur, the researchers said. The study included men whose average age was 54 at the start of the study. \n \n The link between the higher consumption of milk and the loss of cells in this brain area was not found among the men in the study who had ever smoked cigarettes, the researchers noted. Previous research has shown that people who smoke cigarettes may have a lower risk of developing Parkinson's disease, the researchers said. [10 Things You Didn't Know About the Brain] \n \n The researchers also found that residues of the pesticide, called heptachlor epoxide, were present in the brains of 90 percent of the men who drank the most milk, compared with 63 percent of those who did not drink any milk. \n \n High levels of the pesticide were found in the milk supply in the early 1980s in Hawaii, where the chemical was used for insect control in the pineapple industry. The commercial sale of the pesticide in agriculture was banned in the United States by 1988, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. However, a related compound can still be used today for controlling fire ants in electrical grid machinery, according to the Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry. \n \n The researchers noted that they do not have direct evidence that the milk the men drank contained the pesticide. However, they \"just have no other explanation for how heptachlor epoxide found its way into the brains of men who consumed milk,\" said study author Robert D. Abbott, of the Shiga University of Medical Science in Otsu, Japan. \n \n In the study, researchers followed about 450 Japanese-American men for more than 30 years until they died, and then performed autopsies on them. They looked at the cells in the substantia nigra, and also measured the amount of the pesticide residue in 116 of the men's brains, according to the study, published today (Dec. 9) in the journal Neurology. \n \n The findings suggest that diet may play a role in the development of Parkinson's disease, the researchers said. However, the new results do not show a cause-and-effect relationship between the pesticide or milk and Parkinson's disease. Rather, they show there is an association between these factors, they said. \n \n \"The vast majority of milk consumers do not get Parkinson's disease,\" Abbott told Live Science. \n \n But Abbott recommended that people should generally be vigilant about eating food that may contain pesticides. \n \n Dr. Honglei Chen, of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, who was not involved in the study, said that the association found in the study could potentially be explained by mechanisms other than this pesticide actually causing the brain changes. \n \n Chen, who wrote an editorial on the findings that is also published today in the journal, noted that the men's milk consumption was measured only once at the start of the study. The study assumes that \"this measurement represented participants\u2019 dietary habits over time,\" but this may not have been the case, he said in a statement. \n \n Follow Agata Blaszczak-Boxe on Twitter.

While researchers speculated that chemicals found in cows\u2019 milk might be responsible, there was little evidence to detail how dairy products like milk and cheese might be affecting people\u2019s risk of the disease. \n \n Now, scientists may have uncovered a promising clue. Reporting in the journal Neurology, Robert Abbott, from Shiga University of Medical Science in Japan, and his colleagues took advantage of an environmental scandal in Hawaii in the 1980s to investigate the connection. At the time, an organochlorine pesticide used by pineapple farmers made its way into the milk supply when cows were fed a gruel made in part from the pineapple debris. Coincidentally, there was also a study of heart disease among Japanese-American men begun then that involved more than 8,000 men who were followed from mid-life to death. All provided detailed information about what they ate, including how much milk they drank, and some agreed to donate their brains for research upon death. \n \n MORE: Diabetes Drugs May Offer Hope for Parkinson\u2019s Disease Treatment \n \n Abbott and his team studied 449 brains and recorded the density of neurons in specific areas of the brain known to be affected by Parkinson\u2019s. They found that men who reported drinking more than two glasses of milk a day (16 oz) showed the thinnest nerve networks in these areas, suggesting compromised function of these nerves, compared to men who drank little or no milk.

Researchers note that, for a time, cattle in Hawaii were likely fed a gruel containing traces of heptachlor, used by American pineapple farmers before it was banned in 1988, per Time. The cows' milk was contaminated, but \"no one knows how long or how widespread the contamination was before being detected,\" the Parkinson's Disease Foundation says, per NBC News. To test the possible effects, researchers studied the brains of 116 Japanese-American men in Hawaii who had given information about their milk-drinking habits before they died. They found men who consumed more than two glasses of milk, or 16 ounces, daily had 40% fewer brain cells in the substantia nigra, an area that shows damage in Parkinson's cases, compared to men who drank less than two cups per day. Some 90% of heavy milk drinkers also had heptachlor residue in their brains, compared to 63% of those who didn't drink milk. Researchers dated the cell damage to after the accumulation of heptachlor, which suggests the chemical was responsible for the changes. The team couldn't test milk samples, but they \"have no other explanation for how heptachlor epoxide found its way into the brains of men who consumed milk,\" a study author tells Live Science. He notes \"the vast majority of milk consumers do not get Parkinson's disease,\" but \"this adds to the literature that diet may indeed play a role.\" The study also backs others suggesting smokers enjoy protection against Parkinson's: Milk drinkers who smoked showed no brain cell loss. One critic notes participants divulged how much milk they drank some 30 years before they died, so their consumption perhaps changed. (This pesticide has been linked to Alzheimer's.)",

She was found inside a wrapping 21 inches below the bottom of the grave. \n \n Sandoval on Friday pleaded guilty in Greeley District Court to second-degree murder. He will serve 25 years in prison and five years on parole. His sentence was dated back to August 2010 when he was convicted of first-degree murder. \n \n Sandoval, 52, was to face a second trial this week in the Oct. 19, 1995, murder of Tina Sandoval. \n \n Tina Sandoval\u2019s mother Mary Tournai had reported her missing that day after she didn\u2019t return from a planned meeting with Sandoval. \n \n \u201cShe would have continued to make a difference in the world if she had not been killed by her husband,\u201d Tournai said in a statement during the plea and sentencing hearing Friday. \n \n The case went cold despite extensive circumstantial evidence pointing to Sandoval, a convicted peeping Tom. \n \n Tina Sandoval was neither seen nor heard from again, according to a news release by Terasina White, spokeswoman for District Attorney Michael Rourke. \n \n \u201cIf I can\u2019t have you no one else can,\u201d said Rourke, referring to Sandoval\u2019s reasoning for killing his wife. \n \n In June 2009, Rourke\u2019s predecessor, Ken Buck, filed first-degree murder charges against Sandoval. A jury convicted him in August 2010. \n \n In March 2016, the Colorado Court of Appeals overturned his conviction and ordered a new trial. \n \n Sandoval, dressed in a black suit, apologized Friday and expressed his \u201ccondolences\u201d to the family. \n \n But Rourke said Sandoval remained silent for 22 years and only disclosed the whereabouts of his wife\u2019s remains so he could avoid spending the rest of his life in prison. Prosecutors referred to Sandoval as a perverted stalker and murderer. \n \n \u201cWe finally know where Tina is and we can finally lay her to rest the way she deserves,\u201d said her sister, Mary Nerud, 39. \u201cJohn \u2014 you are a murderer.\u201d \n \n According to a family statement, her parents and siblings wrestled with the idea of a plea agreement, which ultimately would mean Sandoval could be released from prison. \n \n \u201cWould our decision to accept a plea deal endanger another woman? Could we live with a longer sentence knowing we would likely never recover Tina? \n \n \u201cWe urge all women who are victims of stalking or domestic violence to separate themselves from the immediate danger and to reach out for help,\u201d the statement says. \n \n Three weeks before the second trial was to begin, Sandoval\u2019s attorneys approached Rouke\u2019s office about the possibility of a plea agreement. Their offer: He would lead investigators to his wife\u2019s remains in exchange for a lighter sentence. \n \n Rourke\u2019s office contacted family members about the proposed agreement, which was later reached on March 23. \n \n That same day, Sandoval led authorities to Sunset Memorial Garden cemetery in Greeley and the grave of WWII veteran Arthur Hert. His grave had been one of three that had been dug and were still open on the day Tina Sandoval disappeared, Rourke said. \n \n \u201cAt the moment I looked down and saw we were dealing with the remains of a World War II veteran, I about passed out,\u201d he said. \n \n Hert\u2019s family in Casper, Wy., was contacted and within 90 minutes, Hert\u2019s son went to the police department and signed a release to allow his father\u2019s grave to be exhumed. Another burial ceremony for Hert was held the following day by Veterans of Foreign Wars. \n \n Rourke said police had received tips that Sandoval had worked at the same cemetery in 1995 and again in 2005, and tipsters had flagged Hert\u2019s grave. But authorities did not attempt any exhumations then. \n \n \u201cFor 7,826 days, 3 hours and 22 minutes, the location of Tina\u2019s remains has been a mystery,\u201d Rourke said during the plea agreement hearing. \u201cOne that has haunted her family and the investigators who worked this case from the minute it was reported, and the community as a whole. While the original conviction served to hold this defendant accountable for the atrocious act he committed, the lingering question as to her whereabouts cast a shadow over this prosecution. Over the course of the last week, we have finally been able to give her family what they so desperately wanted. Tina has been returned to her family and may finally be laid to rest.\u201d \n \n Her family plans a private burial service for their daughter. ||||| Bob Kuznik tries to collect himself as he addresses the public in a press conference after John Sandoval accepted the plea bargain Friday, March 31, 2017, at the Weld County Courthouse in Greeley, Colo.... (Associated Press) \n \n Bob Kuznik tries to collect himself as he addresses the public in a press conference after John Sandoval accepted the plea bargain Friday, March 31, 2017, at the Weld County Courthouse in Greeley, Colo. Sandoval pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. He led Greeley police to the remains of his wife... (Associated Press) \n \n DENVER (AP) \u2014 A Colorado man who pleaded guilty Friday to killing his estranged wife more than two decades ago recently led authorities to her body, which was buried under the grave of a World War II veteran. \n \n John Sandoval, 52, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the 1995 death of Kristina Tournai-Sandoval. \n \n As part of a plea deal, he told investigators March 22 the remains were buried at a Greeley cemetery. \n \n Sandoval found an open gravesite early in the morning on Oct. 20, 1995, that was scheduled for a burial that afternoon. Prosecutors say he dug about 2 feet (0.61 meters) below the grave and buried Tournai-Sandoval's body, which was wrapped in several layers of industrial-grade plastic. \n \n Cemetery workers then unknowingly buried the veteran over her remains. \n \n That day, detectives found a wet and muddy shovel in Sandoval's car and muddy clothes inside his home. After he was arrested, investigators noticed scratch marks on his face, neck and chest. \n \n Charges were not filed at the time because authorities could not find the body, any witnesses or a crime scene. \n \n \"For 7,826 days, 3 hours and 22 minutes, the location of Tina's remains has been a mystery,\" Weld County District Attorney Michael Rourke said in a news release Friday. \"Over the course of the last week, we have finally been able to give her family what they so desperately wanted.\" \n \n Sandoval was convicted in 2010 of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. But an appeals court overturned his conviction last year, ruling a judge wrongfully allowed evidence that Sandoval stalked other women, as well as expert testimony correlating stalkers with murderers. \n \n Prosecutors had been preparing for a new trial when Sandoval acknowledged knowing the location of his wife's body. \n \n Court records show Sandoval had met with his wife to settle a debt before finalizing their divorce. Before the meeting, she warned family members that if anything happened to her, her husband was responsible. She also arranged to talk with her sister by phone after the meeting. ||||| Almost 2 feet below the concrete plate of Arthur Hert's grave at Sunset Memorial Gardens, the key to the one of Greeley's longest-running mysteries was about to emerge. \n \n Wrapped tightly in a comforter, covered by a tarp and sealed with duct tape, the body inside was exhumed last week to solve the mystery of where Tina Tournai Sandoval was buried after her husband killed her on Oct. 19, 1995. \n \n John Sandoval last week led police to this World War II veteran's grave after offering to reveal the remains of his former wife in exchange for a shorter prison sentence. Since his conviction on Aug. 5, 2010, Sandoval had been serving a life sentence. His conviction was overturned on appeal last year, and he was awaiting a second trial. \n \n On March 7, while awaiting hearings for that second trial on the charge of first-degree murder, Sandoval reached out to prosecutors with the only thing he had to bargain with, said Weld District Attorney Michael Rourke. \n \n That resulted in an agreement this week in which he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in exchange for 25 years in prison. The seven-plus years already served will count toward that. His earliest parole date is estimated to be 2028; upon his release, he will be required to serve five years of parole. Rourke said he and the family both wanted to make sure Sandoval was under lock and key and supervision at least until he reach the age of 70. \n \n \"This is not a man to be thanked,\" Rourke said in court Friday. \"He should receive no additional accolades for his cooperation. He sat in silence for 22 years, hoping and believing he'd gotten away with murder, and only on the eve of a second trial did he come forward and bargain with the only thing he can \u2026 and that's Tina's whereabouts.\" \n \n Recommended Stories For You \n \n Sandoval had spent his three-year marriage to Tournai Sandoval, who grew up in Windsor and graduated from Windsor High School, stalking women and collecting underwear from women's homes as a trophy he kept in a garbage bag in the garage. Tournai Sandoval left when police came knocking one too many times \u2014 especially after an allegation that her husband was stalking women in her car overnight in the summer of 1995. \n \n More you may want to read \n \n She moved out in August. By October, she had planned one final meeting with him, to settle an IRS debt during their marriage. She left her overnight nursing job at North Colorado Medical Center at 7 a.m. Oct. 19, 1995, bound for his home in north Greeley. She was never seen again. \n \n Until Sandoval's March 7 revelation, police had no body, no physical evidence, nor solid DNA evidence, much less a confession or witnesses to Tournai Sandoval's death. Jurors at his first trial said prosecutors eliminated any doubt that Sandoval was the killer during the month-long trial. He was the last to have seen her; he had been known to be stalking her; she disappeared off the face of the earth a little too sudden for a promising young nurse who had just landed her dream job; he had fresh scratch marks all over his torso and neck; and he lied about his alibi, which he concocted in jail with his mother. \n \n His conviction, however, was overturned by the Colorado Court of Appeals last year. For the past few months, prosecutors had been readying for a second trial. \n \n Prosecutors considered offering an agreement of a reduced sentence in exchange for the location of the body prior to the first trial, but the family wouldn't accept it. \n \n But time has taken its toll on the family, weary of continued publicity, and continually reliving the pain associated with the loss of their sister, daughter and aunt. \n \n \"We wrestled with the idea that by giving our consent to a plea deal, Tina's murderer will ultimately be released from prison,\" said Bob Kuznik, father-in-law to Susan Kuznik, Tina's sister, in a news conference Friday after the hearing. \"Given credit for time already served and the prospect of an early release for good behavior while in prison, that day of his release would come much sooner than we might like. Knowing that a second trial could again result in a life sentence without the possibility of parole, at what personal sacrifice do we decline the offer and allow a trial to proceed? Would our decision to accept a plea endanger another woman? Could we live with a longer sentence knowing that we would likely never recover Tina? These were not easy issues for us. In the end, we decided as a family and are at peace with it.\" \n \n Police had examined tips about the graveyard burial several years before. On Nov. 1, 1995, then-police detective Brad Goldschmidt followed up on a tip about the possibility of Sandoval hiding his wife's body in an open grave. Sandoval had worked there in 1993 and knew the cemetery's procedures for burial. \n \n There were three open graves on Oct. 19, 1995. Two had a concrete floor; a third did not. Goldschmidt interviewed an employee of the cemetery who discounted the idea that a body would be hidden in the graves because the concrete vaults had already been placed. The employee said he even looked around the cemetery at possible places to hide her. Nothing was found. It was one of literally hundreds of tips that came in for years that led nowhere. \n \n Monday morning quarterbacking aside, Rourke and Greeley Police Chief Jerry Garner said they were satisfied police 20 years ago did the right thing. \n \n \"There were tips both in 1995 and 2005 about the fact that Sandoval had worked there, there were open graves and perhaps are where they could look,\" Rourke said in a news conference Friday. \"The investigation focused on obtaining information. But for reasons everyone could understand, there were no steps at that point to further investigate or seek to investigate any other grave.\" \n \n Rourke said he almost \"passed out\" when he learned they would have to exhume a World War II veteran's grave. He called the family of the veteran, who drove down the next day from Casper, Wyo. On March 22, the family, along with Greeley police and Weld District Attorney's office members, and the honor guard, posted colors over Hert's casket. \n \n \"We felt that was a fitting way to honor him,\" Rourke said. Hours later, along with the Evans Veterans of Foreign War post, they gave Hert a proper military burial and placed his casket back in the grave, Rourke said. \n \n Rourke said on March 24, the Weld County coroner conducted a forensic autopsy on the remains, and the cause of death has not yet been determined. Sandoval did not offer any specifics about the Tounai Sandoval's death. Rourke said he would pursue that question next. \n \n Just four days prior to her body being exhumed was Tournai Sandoval's birthday. She would have been 45. \n \n \"She would have continued to make a difference in the world,\" said her mother, MaryEllen Tournai in court Friday, \"if she had not been killed by her husband.\" \n \n Her family described her in court as brilliant, loving and a gentle soul. Her absence continues to haunt them. \n \n \"Even after 21 years of the horrific and violent murder of Tina, the entire Tournai family regularly experiences shock, numbness and disbelief,\" said Brian Kuznik, the husband of Tina's sister, Susan Kuznik. \"The magnitude of this event and the impact it had on the entire family has proven to be so emotionally difficult, many are unable to stand and share how they feel.\" \n \n Tina's elder sister, Kelly Fryan, told Sandoval she prayed for his conversion of heart for many years so he would become a safer member of society and never again victimize another woman. \n \n \"That being said, God called to make sure I'm not only praying but always active in making sure you do not harm another person,\" she said in the packed courtroom. \"I take that calling seriously. I have accepted this task. I will keep a watchful eye over your life so the safety of any community you reside in will be kept.\" \n \n Not once did Sandoval look back to anyone in the courtroom Friday. But for the first time, he spoke, offering condolences to the Tournai family. \n \n \"I certainly would like to express my condolences and my apologies to Mike and Mary Ellen (Tournai, Tina's parents), the extended Tournai family for the time it took to convince police where we're at today. The devil hardens hearts of man; if man allows, God is able to soften hearts of men \u2026 That's what I pray for.\" \n \n Mike Prill, the Greeley Police detective who re-examined the evidence in 2009, and found new angles and witnesses, had agonized with the family throughout the trial and subsequent setbacks. He glared at Sandoval as he walked in, and was led out of the courtroom. \n \n \"I'm happy the family got their baby back,\" Prill said later. \"John now is irrelevant for almost everyone.\"",

    "document": "While the rest of us were popping champagne to celebrate the arrival of 2018, Seattle greeted the New Year with a 1.75 cent per ounce tax on sweetened beverages. It was needed, former Mayor Ed Murray once said, for a host of noble reasons: to reduce sugar consumption; to raise revenue for important projects like a year of \u201cfree\u201d community college for all graduating public high school students; and, to subsidize purchases of healthy foods by low-income families. \n \n Before he resigned in disgrace over multiple allegations of personal misconduct, Murray considered the soda tax one of his greatest accomplishments, a \u201ccutting edge piece of legislation,\u201d with Seattle setting an example for the whole nation. \n \n Seattle policymakers should have paid more attention to what happened in Cook County, Ill., which repealed its soda tax last year within two months after a tremendous public outcry. Let\u2019s be clear. Soda taxes don\u2019t make people healthier. They don\u2019t raise revenue\u2014they drive it outside city limits. They don\u2019t help ease inequality\u2014they make the poor poorer. Soda taxes don\u2019t unite the city around some vague sense that everyone will be healthier\u2014they unite diverse coalitions in opposition to them: Bernie Sanders and libertarians, labor unions, and businesses all come together to express strong opposition to these regressive, job-killing taxes. \n \n Seattle\u2019s soda tax is particularly burdensome. A case of Gatorade that cost $15.99 on December 31, 2017 now costs $26.33, an increase of more than 64 percent. \n \n Fortunately, business managers and customers are not stupid; retailers like Costco have posted signs directing customers to locations outside city limits where shoppers can buy the product without paying the massive tax. Already, there is evidence that people are voting with their feet and buying drinks in the suburbs, depriving Seattle of the revenue it claims to need. The same thing happened to Philadelphia when it implemented a soda tax. \n \n Seattle\u2019s tax does not apply to sugary drinks that list milk as their primary ingredient, such as many flavored coffee beverages. To their credit, Starbucks rejected their hometown tax. \n \n The west coast is often ground zero for politicians who pride themselves on social engineering. In fact, a study by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University released on January 3, 2018 revealed that three of the top five states with the most paternalistic laws are California, Oregon, and Washington. Nanny staters have looked to Seattle to fulfill their dream of running our lives. The people of the city need to speak up and end this nightmare. ||||| LISTEN: Seattle's sugary drink tax nearly doubles prices at Costco Your browser does not support the audio element. \n \n Customers are feeling the pinch of Seattle\u2019s new Sweetened Beverage Tax. At Costco, a $15.99 case of Gatorade now costs an additional $10.34 due to the tax. \n \n A sign alerts Costco customers to the price change and also lets them know that they can go to the company\u2019s Tukwila or Shoreline stores to buy the product without the added charge. \n \n RELATED: Does Seattle\u2019s new beverage tax target the working class? \n \n The new tax went into affect on January 1, 2018 and tacks on 1.75 cents per ounce. It affects soda, sports drinks, kombucha, and other sugary beverages that don\u2019t list milk as their first ingredient. \n \n \u201cIf you buy in bulk, you\u2019re going to notice it. If you\u2019re just buying an individual can, you probably won\u2019t blink,\u201d KIRO Radio\u2019s Tom Tangney said on Monday\u2019s edition of Tom and Curley. \n \n Because so many of Costco\u2019s products are sold in large quantities, customers are seeing more drastic price increases. \n \n \u201cI gotta say, I like Costco\u2019s approach to this,\u201d KIRO Radio\u2019s Mike Lewis said. \u201cPeople should know. And they should know and they should be able to make an educated decision.\u201d \n \n Many Seattle residents are upset about the tax. Some don\u2019t want to pay more for soda and other drinks. Others think the tax is regressive, meaning it disproportionately affects low-income families. And still others question why the tax leaves out sugar-heavy beverages like many of those sold at Starbucks. \n \n \u201cMake it consistent. Apply it to every sugary drink. Apply it to fast food,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cIf you want to actually start talking about health effects, let\u2019s actually have a conversation about that. Let\u2019s not go to what\u2019s the most convenient thing and attack that.\u201d ||||| Daniel Stein estimates Cook County\u2019s sweetened beverage tax has cost his vending machine company about $75,000 so far, a figure that doesn\u2019t even include lost sales. \n \n The Dec. 1 repeal of the penny-per-ounce tax on sugar and artificially sweetened beverages likely will cost him more before it\u2019s all over. He\u2019ll again have to send technicians to his 850 or so vending machines in Cook County to adjust the price of products. But Stein feels only happiness and relief that the tax that\u2019s consumed his life for months will soon go away. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound judgy but this whole thing has been kind of unfortunate. I\u2019m just glad it\u2019s almost over. \u2026 Closure is good,\u201d said Stein, owner of Northbrook-based Mark Vend. \n \n Wednesday\u2019s repeal vote was a resounding victory for the beverage industry, powered by giant corporations like the Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo, that spent millions fighting the unpopular tax. But Cook County retailers and restaurants, many of whom joined forces with Big Soda in opposition, also celebrated the win after seeing sales dwindle and customers stray across county lines since the tax was implemented Aug. 2. \n \n \u201cObviously, our members are very pleased,\u201d said Rob Karr, president and CEO of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association. \u201cNow the hard work for retailers begins \u2014 to win back shoppers who took their business elsewhere across county lines.\u201d \n \n The short-term impact of the tax was felt by stores both big and small. \n \n Costco\u2019s nine Cook County locations saw a 34 percent decline in sales of beverages affected by the tax, said John McKay, chief operating officer of Costco\u2019s northern division. \n \n The chain saw a corresponding increase of 38 percent in sales of sweetened beverages in its nine stores just outside Cook County, McKay said. \n \n \u201cYou\u2019re displacing shopping from one area, you\u2019re creating congestion in another and it\u2019s just counterproductive,\u201d McKay said. \n \n At Fairplay Foods in suburban Worth, sweetened beverage sales were down about 47 percent, said Rosie Regas, co-owner of the independent chain. Fairplay\u2019s three Chicago stores saw a smaller but still significant drop in sweetened drink sales of around 27 percent. \n \n Regas said she didn\u2019t blame customers for shopping elsewhere; she did the same, driving from her home in Orland Park into Will County to avoid the tax. \n \n \u201cThis was a nightmare. I get it \u2014 the county needs money. But find another way,\u201d Regas said. \n \n And the hospitality industry already has been feeling the cumulative burden of various taxes, said Sam Toia, CEO of the Illinois Restaurant Association. The sweetened beverage tax did nothing but further diminish already thin profit margins, he said. \n \n There are similar sweetened beverage taxes in other jurisdictions in the U.S. \u2014 such as Philadelphia and Berkeley, Calif. \u2014 but Cook County\u2019s tax was unique in how mired in controversy it was leading up to and during its implementation, said John Cawley, professor of policy analysis and management at Cornell University. \n \n At one point, the county said the the tax would apply to purchases made with federal food stamp benefits, then reversed course after receiving further guidance from the state, Cawley noted. Such administrative gaffes created genuine confusion and the well-funded opposition benefited, he said. \n \n \u201cThere were constant challenges that may have contributed to this fatigue. It\u2019s not just on the county government. Millions were spent by the beverage industry and the Can the Tax Coalition to engineer this result,\u201d Cawley said. \n \n The sweetened beverage tax also triggered numerous lawsuits, some of which are still playing out in court. The Illinois Retail Merchants Association sued the county to get the tax thrown out days before it was to take effect. The court granted a restraining order to keep the tax from being imposed. Later, however, the court allowed the tax to move forward. The merchants appealed that decision. \n \n \u201cThe appeal of the circuit court judge\u2019s dismissal is still pending,\u201d said lawyer David Ruskin, who is representing the merchants. \n \n Several retailers have been sued for allegedly misapplying the tax. A Schaumburg man is suing Walgreens for allegedly wrongly charging the tax on unsweetened sparkling water. The case, which seeks class-action status, is still pending, said Elizabeth Fegan, the lawyer for Vincent De Leon. \n \n \u201cWalgreens has filed a motion to dismiss, which we plan to oppose,\u201d Fegan said. \n \n Cawley, the Cornell professor, said there is a legitimate policy argument for taxing sugary food and beverages linked to obesity and diabetes because those conditions drive up health care costs for all. \n \n Groups like the American Heart Association, the Illinois Public Health Institute, the World Health Organization and the Center for Science in the Public Interest have touted the public health benefit of taxing sugar-sweetened beverages. \n \n But that argument was watered down in Cook County, where the tax also included artificially sweetened beverages and also didn\u2019t apply to food stamp purchases. \n \n \"(Taxpayers) will continue to cover the rising costs of treating the chronic diseases caused by drinking too many sugary beverages while also seeing cuts to health care services for our most vulnerable communities,\" Elissa Bassler, CEO of the Illinois Public Health Institute, said in a statement. \n \n gtrotter@chicagotribune.com \n \n byerak@chicagotribune.com \n \n Twitter @GregTrotterTrib \n \n Twitter @beckyyerak \n \n \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b ||||| SPOKANE, Wash. - Seattle is trying to discourage people from sipping on soda through a sugary drink tax, and now a bill is being re-introduced to bring that tax statewide. \n \n The tax adds nearly two cents to every ounce of a sugary drink sold. The bill was first read in February of last year and re-introduced Monday. \n \n Local representative Marcus Riccelli co-sponsored the bill originally, and said he doesn't believe the bill will go anywhere this year or be brought up for a committee vote. \n \n But after seeing the effects of the tax in Seattle, some are worried about the tax coming to Spokane. \n \n Pictures from a Seattle-area Costco have sparked outrage and controversy online. The images show a case of Coke costing an extra nearly $8, and a case of Gatorade going from $16 to more than $26. \n \n Some are worried that if that tax were to come to the rest of the state, it would be bad for local businesses. \n \n \"I understand the reasoning behind it. It just seems like for a business like us, it's just another cost that we're trying to overcome,\" said Heather Baldwin, the lead bartender at King's Bar & Grill. \n \n Baldwin says their business relies heavily on soda. \"The majority of our drinks are made with soda mix. And then we do have a lot of non-alcoholic drinking people and that's what they choose to drink.\" \n \n If the tax were passed statewide, it would also include a tax on syrups and powders which restaurants use to make the soda in their machines. \n \n \"It's going to be sent downhill to us, via the retailers upping their prices and then we're going to have to up our prices,\" Baldwin said. \n \n Seattle leaders say the tax is a good way to discourage people from drinking soda, which can lead to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and hypertension. Some here in Spokane agree that's a good thing. \n \n \"It's a great idea, honestly. Sugar is actually one of the worst things that we can put in our body. And so, I think it's a great idea, incorporating the same tax as alcohol,\" said Spokane resident Jason Prettyman. \n \n Seattle is expected to make $15 million this year from the tax. It will be using part of the money to help fund a program that provides healthy meals for low-income families. ||||| Men of the West! The day may come when state or municipal governments impose a tax on sweetened beverages which functions perfectly as intended. But it is not this day! \n \n Another year, another soda tax. This one was shoved through in the city of Seattle by the municipal government. As usual, its purported intent was to improve the health and lives of residents by \u201cmodifying their behavior\u201d and having them drink fewer sugary beverages. And it\u2019s definitely a muscular incentive for new behavior to be sure. The price of soda has nearly doubled overnight. Seattle residents must be feeling healthier already! (CW33) \n \n Soda lovers are crying carbonated tears! Turns out, a soda tax went into affect in Seattle and people are not drinking the Kool-Aid on this one. Mega-chain Costco isn\u2019t feeling the surge either and put in big black numbers how much the new tax is costing their customers. Not only that, they\u2019re putting signs next to the price display that tells shoppers where they can get their fizz fix outside the city! \n \n As noted in the article, in one of the more creative and admirable moves by a retail chain in recent memory, Costco took to changing their price signs, showing how much the beverages should cost, and then tacking on the new tax as a separate line item. \n \n The city government appears to have been caught totally off guard by the visceral response from consumers. The majority opinion out on the streets seems to be that shoppers will be heading outside the city to shop. And considering the fact that a case of soda has now increased in price by enough to more than pay for the gas, perhaps they\u2019ll just do all of their shopping there. Talk about behavioral modification! \n \n CATO highlighted a Twitter thread from Scott Drenkard of the Tax Foundation, calling on these anti-sugar warriors to at least make some effort to get their story straight. \n \n \u201cFirst they interview people at the Costco who are rightfully shocked at how high prices on soda and sports drinks are now (they are almost doubled).\u201d \n \n \u201cThen they interview a public health advocate who says \u2018that\u2019s right! We want these prices to change people\u2019s behavior and slow sales!\u2019\u201d \n \n \u201cThen they talk to the consumer, \u2018think you\u2019ll change your behavior, maybe even shop somewhere else?\u2019 And she\u2019s like, \u2018ya the Tukwila store is close enough.\u2019 Then they ask a city council member if this will hurt local biz, who says \u2018there is no data\u2019 suggesting that.\u201d \n \n \u201cThen the SAME public health advocate says that people won\u2019t respond to price increases, shopping elsewhere because it isn\u2019t \u2018worth their while.\u2019\u201d \n \n \u201cYou can\u2019t have it both ways people! The tax is either big enough to elicit behavior change, which would slow sales and hurt local biz and potentially reduce calories, or it isn\u2019t. Get your stories straight!\u201d \n \n This is yet another example of the theory of the frog in a boiling pot of water. People are used to having their taxes increased if they live in cities run by Democrats. It\u2019s just a fact of life. And if you increase the tax slowly over time, let\u2019s say by twenty cents per year, many of them will adapt to it. (That\u2019s how they did it with tobacco in most places.) But if you literally double the price overnight, that horse is going to buck. \n \n Seattle hasn\u2019t run into the same constitutional issues that the Chicago soda tax was brought down by, but the level of failure here is just as massive. The original, stated goal was to have people drink less soda, thereby improving their health. But your average consumer doesn\u2019t enjoy being treated like a mouse in a laboratory experiment. Provide them with enough information to make an informed choice and you might achieve the desired result. But raising the price of something they want to the point where only the wealthy can afford it isn\u2019t going to elicit any cooperation. \n \n Of course, the underlying reason for the tax is to raise more money for the city\u2019s coffers. Now, with shoppers heading out of town to buy soda (and probably a lot of other groceries as well), Seattle is seeing what Chicago experienced in the early days of their short-lived soda tax. People are still drinking soda, so there\u2019s no health improvement. But they\u2019re not buying it in the city so the hoped-for revenue surge doesn\u2019t happen. Plus, grocery stores begin losing business, so their tax revenue contribution goes down and some of them may even have to begin laying off workers. \n \n It\u2019s a win-win for liberalism! But sadly, not so much for everyone else.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"That new soda tax in Seattle is working out about as well as Chicago's,\" proclaims a headline at Hot Air. It's not a compliment. The tax, which went into effect Jan. 1, slaps an additional 1.75 cents on each fluid ounce of sugar-sweetened drinks, a group that includes soda, sports drinks, and kombucha. That's nearly double the one-cent levy the Chicago-encompassing Cook County tried, a tax it repealed after about two months. The Chicago Tribune reported at the time that Costco's nine affected locations saw their sales of beverages impacted by the tax fall 34%, while sales jumped 38% at locations just beyond the county line. And Costco is again at the fore of what's happening: Because bulk purchases contain significantly more ounces than an individual one, the impact is starker, as KIRO discovered when it spotted an updated Costco sign for Gatorade in Seattle. The sign details Costco's price for the 35-pack of 16-ounce bottles\u2014$15.99\u2014and separately lists the city's $10.34 tax, for a new total of $26.33. But that's not all the sign says: It also directs consumers to nearby locations that are outside city limits and exempt from the tax. The tax is meant to fight obesity and raise funds for worthy expenditures, but the blog for Citizens Against Government Waste sees the ends quite differently: \"Let\u2019s be clear. Soda taxes don\u2019t make people healthier. They don't raise revenue\u2014they drive it outside city limits. They don\u2019t help ease inequality\u2014they make the poor poorer.\" But some in government seemingly remain hopeful: KXLY reports a bill was reintroduced Monday that would push the tax statewide. (Speaking of Seattle and beverages, the world's largest Starbucks is no longer located there.)",

And we are fixing them. \n \n The news of 157 new emojis in 2018 came earlier this month and if it proved one thing: people are passionate about how their emojis look. \n \n Each year Emojipedia creates sample images for the new emoji release that display how these new characters might look when they hit phones later in the year. \n \n Today we're updating three of these designs to address public feedback: Skateboard, DNA, and Lobster. \n \n Skateboard \n \n Skateboarding legend (and technology enthusiast) Tony Hawk loves that there is a new skateboard emoji, but wasn't impressed with our design. Speaking to New York Magazine, Tony noted we had plenty of room for improvement: \n \n \u201cFirstly, the shape, and the top of it. The way the grip tape is cut, it\u2019s called a die cut \u2014 doing grip tape, then leaving a big blank spot in the middle. It just is very much a mid-\u201980s skateboard, but at a beginner level, and definitely not representative of modern skateboarding\u201d \n \n So we invited him on board as an emoji advisor to help us get it right: \n \n Hoping to help bring the skateboard emoji closer to 2018 than 1985... https://t.co/TIWWbGk1i2 \u2014 Tony Hawk (@tonyhawk) February 8, 2018 \n \n Above: Tony Hawk comes in to rescue the skateboard emoji. \n \n After a helpful DM exchange we settled on a new design to address all of these issues. No more grip tape, no gap in the middle, hopefully more 2018 than 1985: \n \n \n \n Above: The old skateboard emoji design (left) has been replaced by a newer design (right). \n \n This new design is based on Tony's own skateboard, with some minor tweaks to ensure this still works at emoji sizes. \n \n When you're given source material like this, it might as well be used to its fullest potential. \n \n \n \n Above: Tony Hawk's own skateboard (left) was the inspiration behind the updated skateboard emoji design (right). \n \n DNA Double Helix \n \n Apparently we designed our DNA Double Helix to be left handed. This is, I gather, is the wrong way to show it. \n \n So here it is the correct way, shown as a right-handed double-helix: \n \n \n \n Above: The previous (left-handed) DNA emoji (left) has been replaced with a right-handed DNA emoji (right) on Emojipedia. \n \n Lobster \n \n Senator Angus King from Maine has certainly been vocal about his love of the lobster emoji, but was kind enough to spare us the indignity of pointing out that we left off two legs. \n \n Great news for Maine - we're getting a lobster emoji!!! Thanks to @unicode for recognizing the impact of this critical crustacean, in Maine and across the country. \n \n \n \n Yours truly, \n \n \n \n Senator \ud83d\udc2e\ud83d\udc51 \u2014 Senator Angus King (@SenAngusKing) February 7, 2018 \n \n Above: An appreciative US Sentaor appreciates the lobster, with or without the correct number of legs. \n \n Reports showed that our lobster emoji is anatomically inaccurate due to the fact that it's missing a pair of legs. \n \n We've now updated the design, and the correct number of legs has been restored. \n \n Portland Maine's Press Herald goes on to describe the tail as \u201cgrossly malformed\u201d but, well, at emoji-sizes we think the correction of the legs is enough to get this one over the line. \n \n Hearts \n \n One of the new emoji approvals for 2018 is a Unicode character called Smiling Face With Smiling Eyes and Three Hearts which we chose to display with four hearts. \n \n Why? To us, it looked better. As with any emoji design, while Unicode sets the names of new emojis, it's up to vendors to decide how to implement them. Take the \ud83e\udd17 hugging face which looks like jazz hands on so many platforms as an example. \n \n Alright @Emojipedia someone forgot how to count \ud83e\udd23 pic.twitter.com/EGWmIOEP3h \u2014 noah fence (@mattballinger9) February 7, 2018 \n \n Above: Many people pointed out that our face has four hearts, contrary to the name. \n \n The origin of this emoji is from Facebook's \u201cin love\u201d face which can be applied to status updates. We felt that the sentiment could be expressed with any number of hearts. \n \n \n \n Above: Facebook's \u201cin love face\u201d has three hearts, but ours has four. \n \n This one we're going to leave as it is. The average user isn't too concerned with the name of an emoji when using it, but mostly cares how it looks on their phone and others. \n \n Release \n \n Emojis approved as part of Emoji 11.0 will come to most major operating systems in the second half of 2018. Our latest designs have been released as part of Emojipedia 11.1 and now also appear on the latest Unicode emoji charts. \n \n As with all emojis, each vendor will create their own designs when it comes time to implement and these may or may not resemble sample images used at this time. ||||| AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) \u2014 After an outcry, the organization that controls the release of emojis has added two more legs to the forthcoming lobster emoji to make it correct. \n \n The Portland Press Herald reports soon after the Unicode Consortium released proposed images of 157 new emojis to be made available this year, Maine residents took umbrage at the lobster emoji's eight legs instead of the correct 10. \n \n Emojipedia Chief Emoji Officer Jeremy Burge wrote Monday the consortium had heard people's complaints and is releasing updated designs for the lobster emoji, alongside updates for a skateboard and DNA emoji. \n \n The lobster emoji is expected to be available later this year. \n \n ___ \n \n Information from: Portland Press Herald, http://www.pressherald.com ||||| Score one for advocates of anatomically correct emojis. \n \n Responding to outrage from lobster leg aficionados and the Accuracy in Emojis movement (OK, not really), the organization that decides which digital images can dress up the world\u2019s emails, texts and tweets has literally given its new lobster emoji two more legs to stand on. \n \n Soon after the Unicode Consortium released proposed images of the 157 new emojis expected to be available in 2018, some folks noticed the little red lobster came up a bit short. Lobsters have 10 legs \u2013 including their tasty claws \u2013 but the proposed emoji showed only eight legs plus a tail that appeared somewhat malformed. \n \n While a common mistake even among businesses that should arguably know better (ahem, Red Lobster), an eight-legged lobster even in digital cartoonish form didn\u2019t sit well with some people. \n \n \u201cThe #lobsteremoji is happening! Hopefully the final version will have the right number of legs,\u201d tweeted the folks from Rockland\u2019s annual Maine Lobster Festival on Feb. 12 above a picture of an anatomically correct, 10-legged version. \n \n Well, the reference site that creates emoji images took note. \n \n \u201cWe heard you. We made some mistakes. And we are fixing them,\u201d Jeremy Burge, chief emoji officer at Emojipedia, wrote in a blog post Monday unveiling changes to the digital icons for lobster, skateboards and DNA. Emojipedia designs the sample images for emojis, which are then displayed by the Unicode Consortium. \n \n The new proposed emoji has two more legs just behind the cartoon crustacean\u2019s carapace as well as a slightly tweaked tail. \n \n In an email, Burge noted that Emojipedia\u2019s lobster emoji is just a \u201csample image\u201d of what could eventually be available. The companies that make the emojis available to users, such as Apple and Adobe, could come up with their own versions. \n \n \u201cI have to say that I\u2019m a bit embarrassed we didn\u2019t get the leg count right the first time, but I\u2019m happy it was brought to our attention so quickly!\u201d Burge wrote. \u201cI hope to visit Maine one day and will be sure to make liberal use of the lobster emoji when I do.\u201d \n \n Of course, Mainers and lobster lovers weren\u2019t the only ones to critique the accuracy of the new emojis. Emojipedia also \u201cfixed\u201d the DNA emoji to show that the double-helix that carries genetic data twists to the right, not to the left as originally proposed. And Burge wrote in his blog post that skateboarding legend Tony Hawk was brought in as an \u201cemoji advisor\u201d to inform Emojipedia\u2019s second attempt at a skateboard after Hawk pointed out a few foibles in the original. \n \n U.S. Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who pushed hard for an emoji honoring the state\u2019s $500 million commercial lobster fishery, was pleased with the revisions. \n \n \u201cSenator King knows that many around the world were rightly steamed by the exclusion of two legs from the original design, and is grateful that Emojipedia took quick action to ensure that Maine\u2019s delicious decapod will be accurately represented when it crawls onto phones in the coming months,\u201d King spokesman John Faherty said in a statement. \n \n The updated lobster emoji is expected to be available later this year \u2013 hopefully in time for Maine tourists to spice up their tweets, snaps and Facebook posts about chowing down on the real thing. \n \n Kevin Miller can be contacted at 791-6312 or at: \n \n [email protected] \n \n Twitter: KevinMillerPPH \n \n ____________________ \n \n CORRECTION: This story was updated at 1:56 p.m. on Feb. 20, 2018, to say that Emojipedia designs the sample emojis, which are then displayed by the Unicode Consortium. \n \n Share",

    "document": "BEIJING \u2014 The United States and China are the world\u2019s two largest economies, two largest consumers of energy, and two largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Together we account for about 40 percent of the world\u2019s emissions. \n \n We need to solve this problem together because neither one of us can solve it alone. Even if the United States somehow eliminated all of our domestic greenhouse gas emissions, it still wouldn\u2019t be enough to counteract the carbon pollution coming from China and the rest of the world. Likewise, even if China went down to zero emissions, it wouldn\u2019t make enough of a difference if the United States and the rest of the world didn\u2019t change direction. \n \n That\u2019s the reality of what we\u2019re up against. That\u2019s why it matters that the world\u2019s most consequential relationship has just produced something of great consequence in the fight against climate change. \n \n Today, President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping are jointly announcing targets to reduce carbon emissions in the post-2020 period. By doing this \u2013 together, and well before the deadline established by the international community \u2013 we are encouraging other countries to put forward their own ambitious emissions reduction targets soon and to overcome traditional divisions so we can conclude a strong global climate agreement in 2015. \n \n Our announcement can inject momentum into the global climate negotiations, which resume in less than three weeks in Lima, Peru, and culminate next year in Paris. The commitment of both presidents to take ambitious action in our own countries, and work closely to remove obstacles on the road to Paris, sends an important signal that we must get this agreement done, that we can get it done, and that we will get it done. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n This is also a milestone in the United States-China relationship, the outcome of a concerted effort that began last year in Beijing, when State Councilor Yang Jiechi and I started the United States-China Climate Change Working Group. It was an effort inspired not just by our shared concern about the impact of climate change, but by our belief that the world\u2019s largest economies, energy consumers and carbon emitters have a responsibility to lead. \n \n The targets themselves are also important. Ambitious action by our countries together is the foundation to build the low-carbon global economy needed to combat climate change. The United States intends to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 \u2013 a target that is both ambitious and feasible. It roughly doubles the pace of carbon reductions in the period from 2020 to 2025 as compared to the period from 2005 to 2020. It puts us on a path to transform our economy, with emissions reductions on the order of 80 percent by 2050. It is grounded in an extensive analysis of the potential to reduce emissions in all sectors of our economy, with significant added benefits for health, clean air, and energy security. \n \n Our target builds on the ambitious goal President Obama set in 2009 to cut emissions in the range of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020. We are on track to meet that goal, while creating jobs and growing the economy, with the help of a burgeoning clean energy sector. Since the president took office, wind energy production has tripled and solar energy has increased by a factor of ten. This summer, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed the first carbon pollution standards for existing power plants, which account for a third of United States carbon pollution. \n \n The Chinese targets also represent a major advance. For the first time China is announcing a peak year for its carbon emissions \u2013 around 2030 \u2013 along with a commitment to try to reach the peak earlier. That matters because over the past 15 years, China has accounted for roughly 60 percent of the growth in carbon dioxide emissions world-wide. We are confident that China can and will reach peak emissions before 2030, in light of President Xi\u2019s commitments to restructure the economy, dramatically reduce air pollution and stimulate an energy revolution. \n \n China is also announcing today that it would expand the share of total energy consumption coming from zero-emission sources (renewable and nuclear energy) to around 20 percent by 2030, sending a powerful signal to investors and energy markets around the world and helping accelerate the global transition to clean-energy economies. To meet its goal, China will need to deploy an additional 800 to 1,000 gigawatts of nuclear, wind, solar and other renewable generation capacity by 2030 \u2013 an enormous amount, about the same as all the coal-fired power plants in China today, and nearly as much as the total electricity generation capacity of the United States. \n \n There is no question that all of us will need to do more to push toward the de-carbonization of the global economy. But in climate diplomacy, as in life, you have to start at the beginning, and this breakthrough marks a fresh beginning. Two countries regarded for 20 years as the leaders of opposing camps in climate negotiations have come together to find common ground, determined to make lasting progress on an unprecedented global challenge. Let\u2019s ensure that this is the first step toward a world that is more prosperous and more secure. ||||| The United States and China are pledging to move faster to reduce or limit emissions of heat-trapping gases blamed for global warming. China and the U.S. are the world's two largest polluters, and by taking action together, leaders from both countries hope to spur other nations to be equally aggressive as they work to finalize a worldwide climate treaty next year. \n \n What both countries are announcing, according to the White House: \n \n UNITED STATES \n \n \u2014Reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent by the year 2025, compared to what the U.S. was emitting in 2005. Previously, Obama had committed to cutting emissions by 17 percent by 2020 compared to 2005 levels, and officials say the U.S. is on track to meet that goal. \n \n \u2014Double the rate at which the U.S. is reducing its emissions per year. Between 2005 and 2020, the U.S. on average must cut emissions 1.2 percent per year to meet Obama's overall goal of 17 percent. Over the five years between 2020 and 2025, the U.S. aims to reduce emissions and average of 2.3 percent to 2.8 percent per year. \n \n \u2014Submit the new 2025 emissions reduction target by the end of the first quarter of 2015 as the intended U.S. contribution to the U.N.

The trauma surgeon who first treated Mackenzie in the ER didn't expect her to survive. \"I'm glad to be wrong about that,\" Dr. Jeffrey Bender of the University of Oklahoma Medical Center in Oklahoma City said Tuesday at a news conference. \n \n Currently, Wethington is awake and breathing on her own and is listed in fair condition. \u201cWe see worse injuries routinely from car and ATV accidents,\u201d said trauma surgeon Dr. Jason Lees, who is part of the Oklahoma team treating Wethington. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason we wear parachutes when we step out of a plane.\u201d \n \n Amazingly, Wethington, who suffered a lacerated liver and kidney, broken teeth and multiple fractures throughout her body, is expected to fully recover within about six to eight weeks, Bender said Tuesday. Her injuries are \"consistent with someone hit by a car going 40-50 mph,\" although that doesn't mean she hit the ground at that speed, he said. \n \n According to the World Health Organization, falls are the second leading cause of accidental or unintentional injury deaths worldwide. Each year an estimated 424,000 individuals die from falls globally. And it doesn\u2019t have to be a 3,500-foot mishap. \n \n \n \n \u201cA person can take a fall from a standing height and the neck can break, so this young girl is exceptionally fortunate in how the circumstances and force of the fall dissipated throughout her body,\u201d said Dr. Ryan Goodwin, director of the Center for Pediatric and Adolescent Orthopedics at the Cleveland Clinic. \u201cShe is young, and in seeming good health, so she has that going for her.\u201d But, he adds, she also had a lot of luck and physics on her side, too. \n \n \n \n When an individual falls from a great height, survival often depends on a lot of luck, as well as air resistance, or drag. \n \n \u201cYou can think of a fall as a form of energy,\u201d explained James Kakalios, the Taylor Distinguished Professor in the school of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Minnesota. \u201cBasically, if a person steps out of a plane you have no velocity. Gravity will start to pull you down and you accelerate.\u201d \n \n \n \n But as you gain speed, air resistance comes into play and acts as a kind of brake slowing you down and reducing the amount of kinetic energy, or in other words, the force in which your body slams into the ground, said Kakalios, author of the Physics of Superheroes. \n \n He thinks the teen may have done some things accidentally to increase air drag, slowing her fall, and leading to a potentially softer, yet still serious, landing. \n \n \u201cShe\u2019s creating a lot of turbulence as she falling, and therefore she\u2019s maximizing the time it takes for her to hit the ground,\u201d he said, citing that reducing the rate in which an object, or person, comes to a stop is critical for safety. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have airbags,\u201d Kakalios said, citing other instances of people surviving long falls such as I- 35W bridge collapse in Minneapolis in which 13 people were killed, but 145 survived the 115-foot fall and the case of man who survived after he fell 500 feet from a New York skyscraper. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s noteworthy that people don\u2019t usually survive these things, but some people do in the right set of circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cMany people buy lottery tickets and don\u2019t win, but there\u2019s always someone who does win.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tweet email",

    "document": "ESO/Tom Ruen/nagualdesign \n \n Scientists are searching for an unseen planet hiding somewhere in our solar system, but not one set to seemingly appear from nowhere to collide or nearly collide with Earth, ushering in an age of apocalypse. \n \n Over the past several weeks, you may have come across one of those wacky predictions that a planet called \"Nibiru\" or \"Planet X\" is lurking \"behind the sun\" or somewhere else out of view in our solar system but threatening an imminent existential catastrophe nonetheless. \n \n As with much of the fake news and online rumor-mongering that now spreads far and wide in a flash over social media, there is a grain of truth to the story that is then twisted, exaggerated, taken out of context or conflated with others. \n \n The kernel of reality in the 2017 version of the Nibiru cataclysm prophecy, which represents at least the third time the planet has failed to show itself as predicted, is that astronomers increasingly see evidence of an invisible ninth planet in our solar system. \n \n \"There are now five different lines of observational evidence pointing to the existence of Planet Nine,\" CalTech planetary astrophysicist Konstantin Batygin, said Wednesday in a release. \n \n Batygin and his mentor-turned-colleague, Caltech professor Mike Brown, originally hoped to debunk the idea of a hidden planet a few years back. But they have instead discovered more indications that there is something out there, stretching the orbits of distant objects and perhaps even tilting the entire solar system to one side. \n \n \"If you were to remove this explanation and imagine Planet Nine does not exist, then you generate more problems than you solve. All of a sudden, you have five different puzzles, and you must come up with five different theories to explain them,\" Batygin explains. \n \n What Brown and Batygin haven't found, however, is evidence that a ninth planet is anywhere near or will come remotely close to Earth anytime soon. And its aforementioned influence on the entire solar system takes place subtly and over a very long timescale \n \n \"Over long periods of time, Planet Nine will make the entire solar-system plane precess or wobble, just like a top on a table,\" Batygin said. \n \n A world that is unseen, but has a gravitational impact that can be detected through its interaction with other bodies in our outer solar system, is unsurprisingly believed to be significantly massive and very, very far away. Brown and Batygin have estimated the mysterious cosmic neighbor to be perhaps 10 times the mass of Earth and 20 times farther from the sun than Neptune. \n \n So now Batygin and Brown are trying to locate the hidden planet they once tried to disprove using the Subaru Telescope at Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii. They call it the \"best tool\" for finding distant, dim objects hiding in the broad, black sky. \n \n As for spotting Nibiru or Planet X on a collision course with Earth, you could do that by looking up at the sky with your naked eye, where it would easily be visible. Don't see it? That's because it doesn't exist and also, it hasn't been hiding behind the sun for years, because that idea goes against simple geometry. \n \n So carry on and don't worry about unseen colliding planets. Asteroids, though, are another matter... \n \n Technically Literate: Original works of short fiction with unique perspectives on tech, exclusively on CNET. \n \n Crowd Control: A crowdsourced science fiction novel written by CNET readers. ||||| It might be lingering bashfully on the icy outer edges of our solar system, hiding in the dark, but subtly pulling strings behind the scenes: stretching out the orbits of distant bodies, perhaps even tilting the entire solar system to one side. \n \n If a planet is there, it's extremely distant and will stay that way (with no chance -- in case you're wondering -- of ever colliding with Earth, or bringing \"days of darkness\").It is a possible \"Planet Nine\" -- a world perhaps 10 times the mass of Earth and 20 times farther from the sun than Neptune. The signs so far are indirect, mainly its gravitational footprints, but that adds up to a compelling case nonetheless. \n \n One of its most dedicated trackers, in fact, says it is now harder to imagine our solar system without a Planet Nine than with one. \n \n \"There are now five different lines of observational evidence pointing to the existence of Planet Nine,\" said Konstantin Batygin, a planetary astrophysicist at Caltech in Pasadena, California, whose team may be closing in. \"If you were to remove this explanation and imagine Planet Nine does not exist, then you generate more problems than you solve. All of a sudden, you have five different puzzles, and you must come up with five different theories to explain them.\" \n \n Batygin and his co-author, Caltech astronomer Mike Brown, described the first three breadcrumbs on Planet Nine's trail in a January 2016 paper, published in the Astronomical Journal. Six known objects in the distant Kuiper Belt, a region of icy bodies stretching from Neptune outward toward interstellar space, all have elliptical orbits pointing in the same direction. That would be unlikely -- and suspicious -- enough. But these orbits also are tilted the same way, about 30 degrees \"downward\" compared to the pancake-like plane within which the planets orbit the sun. \n \n Breadcrumb number three: Computer simulations of the solar system with Planet Nine included show there should be more objects tilted with respect to the solar plane. In fact, the tilt would be on the order of 90 degrees, as if the plane of the solar system and these objects formed an \"X\" when viewed edge-on. Sure enough, Brown realized that five such objects already known to astronomers fill the bill. \n \n Two more clues emerged after the original paper. A second article from the team, this time led by Batygin's graduate student, Elizabeth Bailey, showed that Planet Nine could have tilted the planets of our solar system during the last 4.5 billion years. This could explain a longstanding mystery: Why is the plane in which the planets orbit tilted about 6 degrees compared to the sun's equator? \n \n \"Over long periods of time, Planet Nine will make the entire solar-system plane precess or wobble, just like a top on a table,\" Batygin said. \n \n The last telltale sign of Planet Nine's presence involves the solar system's contrarians: objects from the Kuiper Belt that orbit in the opposite direction from everything else in the solar system. Planet Nine's orbital influence would explain why these bodies from the distant Kuiper Belt end up \"polluting\" the inner Kuiper Belt. \n \n \"No other model can explain the weirdness of these high-inclination orbits,\" Batygin said. \"It turns out that Planet Nine provides a natural avenue for their generation. These things have been twisted out of the solar system plane with help from Planet Nine and then scattered inward by Neptune.\" \n \n The remaining step is to find Planet Nine itself. Batygin and Brown are using the Subaru Telescope at Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii to try to do just that. The instrument is the \"best tool\" for picking out dim, extremely distant objects lost in huge swaths of sky, Batygin said. \n \n But where did Planet Nine come from? Batygin says he spends little time ruminating on its origin -- whether it is a fugitive from our own solar system or, just maybe, a wandering rogue planet captured by the sun's gravity. \n \n \"I think Planet Nine's detection will tell us something about its origin,\" he said. \n \n Other scientists offer a different possible explanation for the Planet Nine evidence cited by Batygin. A recent analysis based on a sky mapping project called the Outer Solar System Origins Survey, which discovered more than 800 new \"trans-Neptunian objects,\" suggests that the evidence also could be consistent with a random distribution of such objects. Still, the analysis, from a team led by Cory Shankman of the University of Victoria, could not rule out Planet Nine. \n \n If Planet Nine is found, it will be a homecoming of sorts, or at least a family reunion. Over the past 20 years, surveys of planets around other stars in our galaxy have found the most common types to be \"super Earths\" and their somewhat larger cousins -- bigger than Earth but smaller than Neptune. \n \n Yet these common, garden-variety planets are conspicuously absent from our solar system. Weighing in at roughly 10 times Earth's mass, the proposed Planet Nine would make a good fit. \n \n Planet Nine could turn out to be our missing super Earth. \n \n News Media Contact \n \n Written by Pat BrennanElizabeth LandauJet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.818-354-6425elizabeth.landau@jpl.nasa.gov2017-259 ||||| A possible \"Planet Nine\" in Earth's solar system would orbit far beyond Neptune's orbit (visible as a bright ring around the sun in this artist's illustration). \n \n Planet Nine is out there, and astronomers are determined to find it, according to a new statement from NASA. In fact, mounting evidence suggests it's hard to imagine our solar system without the unseen world. \n \n The hypothetical planet is believed to be about 10 times more massive than Earth and located in the dark, outer reaches of the solar system, approximately 20 times farther from the sun than Neptune is. While the mysterious world still has yet to be found, astronomers have discovered a number of strange features of our solar system that are best explained by the presence of a ninth planet, according to the NASA statement. \n \n \"There are now five different lines of observational evidence pointing to the existence of Planet Nine,\" Konstantin Batygin, a planetary astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, said in the statement. \"If you were to remove this explanation and imagine Planet Nine does not exist, then you generate more problems than you solve.

Their findings revealed that all of those Kuiper Belt objects have elliptical orbits that point in the same direction and are tilted about 30 degrees \"downward\" compared to the plane in which the eight official planets circle the sun, according to the statement. \n \n Using computer simulations of the solar system with a Planet Nine, Batygin and Brown also showed that there should be even more objects tilted a whopping 90 degrees with respect to the solar plane. Further investigation revealed that five such objects were already known to fit these parameters, the researchers said. \n \n Since then, the astronomers have found new evidence that further supports the existence of Planet Nine. With help from Elizabeth Bailey, an astrophysicist and planetary scientist at Caltech, the team showed that Planet Nine's influence might have tilted the planets of our solar system, which would explain why the zone in which the eight major planets orbit the sun is tilted by about 6 degrees compared to the sun's equator. \n \n \"Over long periods of time, Planet Nine will make the entire solar-system plane precess, or wobble, just like a top on a table,\" Batygin said in the statement. \n \n Finally, the researchers demonstrate how Planet Nine's presence could explain why some Kuiper Belt objects orbit in the opposite direction from everything else in the solar system. \n \n \"No other model can explain the weirdness of these high-inclination orbits,\" Batygin said in the statement. \"It turns out that Planet Nine provides a natural avenue for their generation.

    "document": "While browsing amber markets in Myanmar, scientists discovered the feathers and partial tail of a tiny baby dinosaur that lived some 99 million years ago. \n \n The find, described in the journal Current Biology, offers a rare window onto the structure and organization of dinosaur feathers \u2014 one that could help shed new light on their evolution. \n \n Scientists have long studied feathers that pop up in the fossil record in part because they want to understand the origins of birds. Birds are thought to be the only living descendants of dinosaurs \u2014 and questions of how and when their ancestors first developed flight (and the feathers that enabled it) remain confounding mysteries. \n \n In recent years, paleontologists have also realized that many dinosaurs were not scaly (a la Jurassic Park) but feathered like birds. However, their plumage\u2019s original purpose (for example, for insulation or for camouflage) remains up for debate. Researchers want to understand the origin of feathers, as well as figure out how they eventually evolved for flight. \n \n But there are limits to what they can learn from studying feathers in isolation, without seeing how they were positioned and organized on the body \u2014 and without knowing which species the feathers came from. And those preserved plumes found with fossil skeletons are typically compressed flat in the rock, which makes it difficult to know what the animal looked like in three dimensions. \n \n Scientists have discovered the partial tail and feathers of a 99-million-year-old baby dinosaur covered in feathers. (R.C McKellar / Royal Saskatchewan Museum) \n \n This new fossil, encased in amber, solves all of those issues. Co-lead author Lida Xing of the China University of Geosciences discovered the fossil at an amber market in Myanmar last year. Because of its bushy appearance, the seller believed the tail to be some kind of trapped plant \u2014 but Xing believed differently and asked the Dexu Institute of Paleontology to purchase it. \n \n \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until Lida took a close look at it that he realized there were feathers coming off the side of the little filaments running through the amber,\u201d said co-lead author Ryan McKellar, a paleontologist with the Royal Saskatchewan Museum in Regina, Canada. \u201cThat\u2019s when the real fun began, from a research standpoint.\u201d \n \n Amber is a paleontologist\u2019s best friend for many reasons: Among them, it insulates the fossil from chemical alteration by the environment and helps to preserve it in three dimensions. \n \n \u201cAmber is like nature\u2019s plastic,\u201d McKellar said. \u201cIt seals in a lot of information at the same time it\u2019s basically drying out a lot of inclusions that end up in the resin.\u201d \n \n Cheung Chung-tat and Liu Yi A reconstruction of the sparrow-sized coelurosaur. A reconstruction of the sparrow-sized coelurosaur. (Cheung Chung-tat and Liu Yi) \n \n Xing, McKellar and colleagues CT-scanned the tail through the amber, studying its microscopic structure. \n \n The partial tail, which probably belonged to a coelurosaur about the size of a sparrow, consists of eight full vertebra surrounded by highly preserved feathers. In birds, tailbones are fused together in what\u2019s known as a pygostyle, which is why scientists think this one must have come from a non-avialan dinosaur. \n \n \u201cThis flexible tail isn\u2019t something that you see in modern birds, so it restricts you to a group of dinosaurs that are outside of archaeopteryx and modern birds,\u201d McKellar said. \u201cYou have to be dealing with something lower down in the evolutionary tree. And this means you\u2019re firmly in dinosaur territory, as opposed to bird territory.\u201d \n \n Unlike birds, the dinosaur\u2019s feathers had an underdeveloped main stem, or rachis. The top feathers were dark and those on the underside were light, so it may have been used for camouflage or signaling, McKellar said. \n \n There are limits to what this particular fossil can reveal about feathered dinosaurs, the scientist added \u2013 but it does show that more such fossils might well exist, mistaken for bushy plants or other debris, just waiting to be found. His colleagues, he added, were continuing to search amber markets, hoping to get lucky once again. \n \n CAPTION Revelers joined community members and indigenous leaders from around the world at the Symbiosis Gathering in Big Summit Prairie, Ore., to mark the Great American Eclipse.

A Cretaceous-era ant and plant debris were also trapped in the resin. Photograph by R.C. McKellar, Royal Saskatchewan Museum \n \n The research, led by paleontologist Lida Xing of the China University of Geosciences, was funded in part by the National Geographic Society's Expeditions Council. \n \n A Telling Tail \n \n The semitranslucent mid-Cretaceous amber sample, roughly the size and shape of a dried apricot, captures one of the earliest moments of differentiation between the feathers of birds of flight and the feathers of dinosaurs. (Learn more about the evolutionary relationship between dinosaurs and birds.) \n \n Inside the lump of resin is a 1.4-inch appendage covered in delicate feathers, described as chestnut brown with a pale or white underside. \n \n View Images A micro-CT scan reveals the delicate feathers that cover the dinosaur tail. Photograph by Lida Xing \n \n CT scans and microscopic analysis of the sample revealed eight vertebrae from the middle or end of a long, thin tail that may have been originally made up of more than 25 vertebrae. \n \n View Images A scan of the underside of the tail shows the feather arrangement. Photograph by Lida Xing \n \n Based on the structure of the tail, researchers believe it belongs to a juvenile coelurosaur, part of a group of theropod dinosaurs that includes everything from tyrannosaurs to modern birds. \n \n Feathered, but Could It Fly? \n \n The presence of articulated tail vertebrae in the sample enabled researchers to rule out the possibility that the feathers belonged to a prehistoric bird. Modern birds and their closest Cretaceous ancestors feature a set of fused tail vertebrae called a pygostyle that enables tail feathers to move as a single unit. \n \n \"[A pygostyle] is the sort of thing you've seen if you've ever prepared a turkey,\" says study co-author Ryan McKellar, curator of invertebrate paleontology at Canada's Royal Saskatchewan Museum. \n \n View Images The dinosaur feather structure is open, flexible, and similar to modern ornamental feathers. Photograph by Royal Saskatchewan Museum \n \n The dinosaur feathers feature a poorly defined central shaft (rachis) and appear to keel to either side of the tail. The open, flexible structure of the feathers is more similar to modern ornamental feathers than to flight feathers, which have well-defined central shafts, branches, sub-branches, and hooks that latch the structure together. \n \n In a report in June of this year by the same research team, Cretaceous-era bird wings preserved in amber revealed feathers remarkably similar to the flight feathers of modern birds. \n \n The current study concludes that if the entire length of the dinosaur tail was covered in the type of feathers seen in the sample, the dinosaur \"would likely have been incapable of flight.\" Rather, such feathers may have served a signaling function or played a role in temperature regulation, says McKellar. (Could dinosaurs fly?) \n \n Pull Quote Maybe we can find a complete dinosaur. Lida Xing, paleontologist \n \n The weakly developed tail feathers also suggest that the owner of the Cretaceous tail falls somewhere lower down on the evolutionary tree of theropod dinosaurs, \"perhaps a basal [primitive] maniraptoran,\" Xing suggests, referring to the subgroup of coelurosaurs that includes oviraptorosaurs and therizinosaurs. (See the oviraptorosaur that paleontologists have dubbed the \"chicken from hell.\") \n \n Destined for Jewelry, but With a Silver Lining \n \n The amber sample\u2014formally called DIP-V-15103 and nicknamed \"Eva\" in honor of paleobotanist Eva Koppelhus, the wife of co-author Philip Currie\u2014comes from a mine in the Hukawng Valley in Kachin state, northern Myanmar. Amber from this region most likely contains the world's largest variety of animal and plant life from the Cretaceous period. \n \n It was one of more than a dozen amber samples with significant inclusions that were collected by Xing and his research team in 2015 at a well-known amber market in Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin state. Two of the other samples contained the dinosaur-era bird wings published earlier this summer. \n \n The majority of Burmese amber is used in jewelry and carvings, and the \"Eva\" sample had already been subject to shaping by the time it was collected by the researchers. \n \n View Images The amber sample, from a mine in Myanmar, had already been partially shaped into an oval by a jewelry maker. Photograph by R.C> McKellar, Royal Saskatchewan Museum \n \n The modification had a silver lining, however: It offered \"a nice cross section\" through the tail that enabled the scientists to study the chemistry of the exposed surface, notes McKellar. \n \n That study revealed the presence of ferrous iron, a decomposition product from the blood hemoglobin that was once present in the dinosaur's soft tissue. \n \n \"The fact that [the iron] is still present gives us a lot of hope for future analysis, to obtain other chemical information on things like pigmentation or even to identify parts of the original keratin,\" says McKellar. \"Maybe not for this particular specimen, but for other [samples] down the road.\" \n \n Meanwhile, Xing believes that the \"nearing end\" of a decades-old conflict between the Myanmar government and the Kachin Independence Army, which controls the Hukawng Valley, will lead to increased scientific access to the amber mines and, in, turn, to an increase in spectacular discoveries.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Researchers were perusing an amber market in Myanmar when they stumbled across a truly extraordinary specimen, National Geographic reports. Trapped inside a golden piece of amber\u2014already partially shaped to be sold as jewelry\u2014was a fully feathered section of a dinosaur's tail. According to the Los Angeles Times, the person selling the amber thought it was some kind of plant. While scientists have found evidence of feathered dinosaurs, not to mention feathered prehistoric birds, this piece of amber is the first time feathers have been found perfectly preserved and attached to what is unmistakably a dinosaur. The find was published Thursday in Current Biology. The tail section is believed to belong to a young, sparrow-sized coelurosaur that lived 99 million years ago. Researchers know the tail belongs to a dinosaur because of its articulated vertebrae; birds have vertebrae that are fused together. And because of the way the features are structured, researchers believe they were useless for flight. It remains unclear exactly what purpose the feathers served, though researchers theorize dinosaurs may have used them for camouflage, regulating their body heat, or signaling to other animals. Now that researchers can see how feathers actually appeared on a dinosaur's body, they hope to learn how they evolved for flight in modern-day birds. They also believe that, given access to Myanmar's amber mines, they may one day find a whole preserved dinosaur.",

Parker, 57, was diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer in 2016. When she decided to end her life she was in excruciating pain from tumours in her bones, and had recently learned that the cancer had spread to her brain lining. Since Canada\u2019s medically assisted dying law requires last-minute consent from the patient, Parker chose to go before her condition worsened further. \n \n If she could have made an advance request, she said she would have stayed until after Christmas. Parker made a public call for the government to amend the law to eliminate late-stage consent in situations like hers. \n \n Article Continued Below \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re not considering changing something in the legislation,\u201d Wilson-Raybould told reporters on Nov. 2. In an interview on the same day, Fisher said he felt differently. \u201c(My constituents) are basically saying that they support (Parker) and my personal view is I\u2019m supportive of it as well,\u201d he said. In Parker\u2019s final Facebook post she said the assisted dying law was \u201cpoorly thought out,\u201d and asked the public to contact their MPs about changing it. Thousands have responded to Parker\u2019s post, many of them expressing support for her request. In addition to Fisher, the other three Halifax-area MPs were asked for interviews Friday. Geoff Regan and Darrell Samson did not respond to the request. Andy Fillmore responded with an emailed statement, saying in part: \u201cMany constituents have sent me emails containing (Parker\u2019s) final Facebook post, adding their own reflections. It\u2019s clear that she has left an impact on our community, and on the ongoing conversation related to medical assistance in dying.\u201d \u201cWe know that medical assistance in dying is a deeply personal choice, and I believe it is important that Canadians have access to it if they choose.\u201d Fillmore\u2019s email went to on to say that he \u201clooked forward\u201d to reading an upcoming report on the issue. When Ottawa first drafted the medically assisted dying law, it asked the Council of Canadian Academies \u2014 a non-profit organization that operates on federal funding \u2014 to review three unresolved issues, including advance requests. A report on that review is due to be tabled at the House of Commons by the end of this year. Fisher said the report would not offer recommendations, but rather a summary \u201cof the evidence of all the different perspectives.\u201d \u201cI do feel that we could have gone a little bit further on this and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing that report come in December,\u201d he said. Stephen McNeil, Nova Scotia\u2019s Liberal premier, offered his respect to Parker in a statement after her death, calling her \u201ccourageous.\u201d He otherwise left her request to the federal government. \u201cThis debate will continue at the national level, and she will be a major voice in the conversation that I\u2019m sure Canadians are going to have.\u201d Halifax Mayor Mike Savage echoed McNeil\u2019s response, saying in an interview Friday that he was \u201cimpressed at her courage and tenacity,\u201d but that there was nothing he could do at a municipal level to address her plea.

She was 57. \n \n Parker\u2019s lost battle for greater autonomy in medically assisted death has reignited a debate over Canada\u2019s legislation on medically assisted death, which critics say forces terminally ill people to choose two equally unpalatable choices: a death that is premature, or one that is painful. \n \n Sign up for the new US morning briefing \n \n Parker was not the first to use Canada\u2019s medically assisted death laws \u2013 more than 3,700 already have done so since the country\u2019s supreme court paved the way for physician-assisted death in 2015 \u2013 but she quickly became one of the country\u2019s most prominent advocates for changes in the law. \n \n \u201cThe world lost a person that had such spirit, who kind of always knew she was going to do something really, really important,\u201d said Kim King, a close friend who was with Parker during her last moments. \u201cAnd in the end, she did.\u201d \n \n Legislation passed in 2016 allowed anyone above the age of 18 with a \u201cgrievous and irremediable medical condition\u201d to apply for physician-assisted death. Individuals must undergo consultations and be examined by two clinicians in order to gain approval for the process. \n \n Parker was assessed and approved, but a key provision in the law \u2013 that she be of full mental capacity when the decision to terminate life is made \u2013 derailed her plans. \n \n \u201cWhen we realized the implications of the late-stage consent, it was very disturbing,\u201d said King. \u201cShe was so courageous to face her death head on.\u201d \n \n If she wanted to die on her own terms, it would have to be when she was still mentally sound. While she wanted to live to see another Christmas, she told friends she couldn\u2019t run the risk of waiting too long. \n \n \u201cShe was worried about how this cancer had ravaged her body so aggressively that if she waited too long, she would lose capacity and then she would be completely denied the right to have an assisted death,\u201d said Shanaaz Gokool, head of Dying with Dignity Canada. \u201cAnd then she would die in a manner she knew will be horrible.\u201d \n \n For clinicians and bioethicists, Parker\u2019s fight encapsulates an ongoing debate within the medical community surrounding how to best help patients in their final days. \n \n \u201cA lot of us knew when the legislation came down, that this would be one of the next battle grounds,\u201d said Chris Kaposy, a bioethicist at Memorial University. While the law has produced troubling situations like Parker\u2019s, it also aims to protect vulnerable people, said Kaposy. \n \n Clinical ethicists often grapple with instances of patients with late-stage dementia, some of whom have requested physician-assisted death \u2013 but later forget these wishes and go on to live contented lives, he said. \n \n \u201cYou have to walk that line between honouring legitimate directives, where people are suffering \u2026 But also you want to be able to avoid situations where you\u2019re obligated to essentially kill people who are happy.\u201d \n \n Only three countries permit people to plan their death beforehand, and do not require competency at the moment of death: the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Belgium. \n \n But according to King, \u201c[Parker] didn\u2019t suffer from dementia, she wasn\u2019t vulnerable. And she was very clear about what she wanted.\u201d \n \n Parker\u2019s death has prompted a fresh debate on end-of-life planning in Canada, said Dr Jeff Blackmer, vice-president of the Canadian Medical Association. \u201cIf you agree with assisted dying or not, one of the silver linings to this has been a more open discussion about death and dying in Canada \u2013 and about the choices that we make at the end of our lives,\u201d he said. \n \n A government panel which is studying the existing legislation will release its full report in December, but will not make any recommendations, and the government will not be required to act. \n \n The day after Parker\u2019s death, the federal justice minister, Jody Wilson-Raybould, expressed no intention of amending the current law. \u201cWe\u2019re not considering changing something in the legislation,\u201d she told reporters, adding that she and the government were \u201cconfident in the legislation\u201d. \n \n While the minister\u2019s position disappointed King and other friends, they see it as a reason to keep pushing hard for changes in the law, continuing the battle Parker fought to the end. \n \n \u201cUntil she took her last breath yesterday, she never wavered,\u201d said King. \u201cIt was just so beautiful.\u201d ||||| Open this photo in gallery Friends massage Audrey Parker's hands and feet at the end of her last party. (Photojournalist Chris Donovan has a family relationship with Audrey Parker) Chris Donovan/The Globe and Mail \n \n After a decadent breakfast of lobster eggs Benedict prepared by a friend in her modern high-rise kitchen Thursday morning, Audrey Parker plans to tidy up, climb back into her king-sized bed and receive a lethal injection. \n \n Ms. Parker, who lives in Halifax, is three years into a battle with Stage 4 breast cancer she chose to \u201clean into\u201d rather than resist because of its ravenous spread to her bones and brain. A former ballroom dancer and makeup artist with an affinity for the brand Chanel, Ms. Parker decided immediately after her diagnosis that she wanted to end her life on her own terms. She qualified to do so under Canada\u2019s assisted-dying legislation. That law requires patients to be lucid enough to consent to their own deaths \u2013 and Ms. Parker feared she wouldn\u2019t be if she waited too long. \n \n The 57-year-old effervescent divorcee has taken pleasure in scripting what she calls her \u201cdream death,\u201d with the exception of one key element: choosing the actual day she will die. On this, Ms. Parker says her pen was unfairly forced by federal legislation requiring patients to be able to confirm their wish to die moments before a fatal injection is administered. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n \u201cAll I wanted to do was have a fabulous end-of-life experience on my own terms,\u201d said Ms. Parker, who plans to die Thursday, holding her elderly mother\u2019s hand and surrounded by her best friends, even though she is still full of life. \u201cI would have liked to have really lived until Christmas. But I can\u2019t take the chance of losing my window.\u201d \n \n Ms. Parker\u2019s predicament highlights what some physicians and supporters of assisted dying see as a defect in Canada\u2019s law and it is one Ms. Parker is bent on altering, if only posthumously. \n \n Patients ending their lives are required to give what is known as \u201clate stage consent,\u201d meaning they must be lucid enough to agree to their own death immediately before a doctor or nurse practitioner administers the cocktail of life-ending drugs. If patients cannot give late-stage consent, they cannot, under the law, receive an assisted death. \n \n Open this photo in gallery Audrey Parker is comforted by her friend Denise Doucet as they say goodbye at the end of night. Chris Donovan/The Globe and Mail \n \n Intended as a safeguard, the rule has had unintended consequences. Ms. Parker said it seemed to force early death on her before it really feels like her time is up. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019ve literally taken my ability to die on my own terms away from me,\u201d Ms. Parker said of lawmakers. \u201cI have cancer in the lining of my brain. I could wake up tomorrow and I might not be myself. I just don\u2019t know,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cIt defies the whole point of the law. People are dying sooner than they need to.\u201d \n \n To avoid that fate, some patients choose to dial back their painkillers before receiving an assisted death to ensure they are fit to consent, a decision that leads to increased suffering, said Jeff Blackmer, the vice-president of medical professionalism for the Canadian Medical Association, which represents doctors across the country. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s obviously a challenge that clinicians are concerned about,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want patients to undergo any sort of pain or suffering that could otherwise be avoided.\u201d \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n Cutting back her cocktail of pain medication \u2013 heavy doses of Dilaudid and cannabis \u2013 was something Ms. Parker said she could not endure. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m picking to die over going through that pain again,\u201d she said in an interview with The Globe and Mail one afternoon last week between sips of Red Bull, her walls filled with framed art she chose for her funeral, including a depiction of a nearly empty hourglass. \"But if they would just let me die on my own terms \u2026 I\u2019d figure out the right day.\u201d \n \n Ms. Parker reluctantly but firmly chose Nov. 1. She is haunted by cases of terminally ill patients who were approved for an assisted death but didn\u2019t get one after losing their capacity to consent. \n \n According to Health Canada\u2019s most recent interim report on medically assisted dying, 3,714 legal assisted deaths have been carried out in Canada as of the end of last year. An analysis of why requests for the procedure are turned down in six provinces found that loss of capacity was the reason cited most frequently, followed by the patient\u2019s death not being deemed \u201creasonably foreseeable,\u201d as the law requires. \n \n Some of the experts who helped to inform Canada\u2019s assisted dying law predicted that prohibiting advance requests would lead to situations such as Ms. Parker\u2019s. \n \n Open this photo in gallery An ex-husband of Audrey Parker comes to say goodbye during her last party at her apartment in Halifax. Chris Donovan/The Globe and Mail \n \n After the Supreme Court of Canada struck down the Criminal Code prohibition against helping others take their own lives in 2015, a special joint committee of the House and Senate and a provincial-territorial expert advisory group were set up to make recommendations about how the new assisted-dying law should work. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n Both groups recommended that the federal legislation allow for advance requests for assisted death in limited circumstances. The panels felt that patients such as Ms. Parker \u2013 those whose cases have already been rigorously assessed by two doctors and approved for an assisted death \u2013 should be allowed to make advance requests that set out the future terms for their death that wouldn\u2019t be jeopardized as their mental capacity deteriorated. \n \n The panels also recommended that the same permission be extended to people diagnosed with diseases such as dementia, a category of patients that raises difficult ethical concerns. \n \n However, no advance requests of any kind were allowed under the legislation passed by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberal government in June of 2016. The legislation included a provision that independent reviewers would be asked to study whether the law should be expanded to cover three types of patients currently excluded: mature patients under the age of 18; patients whose sole reason for seeking an assisted death is mental illness and patients who want to make advance requests to have doctors hasten their deaths. \n \n The Council of Canadian Academies, a federally funded not-for-profit organization, is expected to publish a review of the evidence for all three situations in December. However, the reports won\u2019t make any formal recommendations. They will only summarize the evidence. \n \n Those advocating for changes that would allow advance directives say it is important to distinguish between cases such as Ms. Parker\u2019s and those that involve patients who have been diagnosed with dementia. The latter involve more complex practical and philosophical challenges, including which version of a patient should have the final say, said Hilary Young, a University of New Brunswick law professor with an expertise in health law and informed consent. \n \n \u201cIs it the [predementia] person who didn\u2019t want to be a burden and who valued her cognitive faculties very highly, or the present person who\u2019s quite happy to read the same page of a book every day or watch television?\u201d \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n Open this photo in gallery Chris Donovan/The Globe and Mail \n \n Canada is not the only country grappling with these questions. The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Colombia all allow advance requests for assisted death but some have specific rules that limit their use. \n \n However, the complexities wrought by dementia are not a concern in cases such as Ms. Parker\u2019s, which some argue ought to be given more expansive consideration. \n \n \u201cShe\u2019s presently suffering and has a good sense of what she\u2019s facing,\" Prof. Young said. \"In that context, it seems almost arbitrary to deny her the ability to make that decision.\u201d \n \n The advocacy group Dying with Dignity Canada agrees. Although the organization also supports advance requests for assisted death for people with dementia, its leaders, along with Ms. Parker\u2019s friends and family, are launching a campaign to change the federal law so that patients who have been approved for an assisted death can get one, even if they aren\u2019t able to consent at the moment of death. \n \n Chief executive Shanaaz Gokool, said they want any amendment to be named Audrey\u2019s Law, in Ms. Parker\u2019s honour. \n \n Ms. Parker would like that too. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not doing this for me. I\u2019m already out of here. I\u2019m doing this for you guys,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s all be proactive now. If people just demand this ... we don\u2019t need a debate. Just an amendment to the legislation.\u201d \n \n Ms. Parker said she gave that message to Justice Department officials in a telephone conversation facilitated by Dying with Dignity Canada last week. \n \n \u201cI really pleaded with them. I begged them to lift that late stage consent,\u201d Ms. Parker said. \u201cLife just worked out for me. Everything went my way. It really did. So I want my death to go my way too.

Or heard a voice speaking out loud that you know wasn't really there? Psychologists used to say these were signs of mental illness. But now it turns out that they aren't that unusual \u2014 and even people who hear a lot of voices have a wide range of experiences with them. \n \n Illustration by John T Takai \n \n \n \n A new study published this week in The Lancet Psychology is the result of an online survey and in-depth analysis of 153 people who have heard voices. What the researchers found was that there is huge variation in ways that people \"hear things.\" For example, the stereotype of a person with schizophrenia is that they hear angry voices telling them to do terrible things \u2014 we've all seen this in countless bad movies. But many people who hear voices say that they aren't so much \"voices\" as they are characters, with personalities, who are trying to hold conversations. Often they are internal voices and don't say anything aloud. It's almost as if they are exaggerated of the kinds of internal dialogues we have in our heads every day, as we debate what to do after work or whether we should really blow a bunch of money on the new MacBook. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Indeed, Durham University researcher Angela Woods, who led the study, noted that as many as 15 percent of people who report hearing voices haven't been diagnosed with any psychological disorder. She and her colleagues believe that \"hearing voices\" is far more complicated than anyone had ever realized \u2014 sometimes they even involve physical sensations like tingling in the hands and feet. People who hear voices say that they can be troubling, but they can also be friendly. Often, therapies can help them understand the voices as parts of themselves, cluing them into subconscious concerns. \n \n In a release, Woods said: \n \n We call into question the presumed auditory quality of hearing voices and show that there is an unrecognised complexity in the 'character' qualities of some voices. It is crucial to study mental health and human experiences such as voice-hearing from a variety of different perspectives to truly find out what people are experiencing, not just what we think they must be experiencing because they have a particular diagnosis. We hope this approach can help inform the development of future clinical interventions. \n \n The implication here is that there are a wide range of experiences for people who hear voices, and that many of them don't fit the typical definitions. Woods and her colleagues believe that psychology researchers need to talk to more people who hear voices in order to understand the full range of what the experience is like \u2014 as well as how we can treat it, when needed. \n \n The entire study is available online at The Lancet Psychology. ||||| \u00ab A Bias in Field Goals and Penalty Kicks? | Blog Home Page | Review: 'Strongest' Research Shows No Link Between Gun Ownership Rates and Higher Crime \u00bb \n \n Posted by Ross Pomeroy \n \n \n \n In the Biblical story of Jacob told in Genesis 28, Jacob settled down for the night when trekking through the deserts of Canaan and fell asleep: \n \n \u201cAnd he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it! And behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, \u2018I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie I will give to you and to your descendants; and your descendants shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and by you and your descendants shall all the families of the earth bless themselves.\u201d \n \n Jacob thought he received a message from God, but most modern cognitive scientists would say that's unlikely. Instead, they would proffer that his mind had manufactured vivid images, emotions, ideas, and sensations. Jacob's apparent theophany was a dream, nothing more. \n \n In Ancient Greece and Rome, people believed that dreams were direct messages from deities. While the precise mechanism for dreams remains unknown, scientists have narrowed down their origin to somewhere in the brain, not the beyond. \n \n Sleep is divided into four distinct stages. In the final stage, called rapid-eye movement (REM), the brain lights up with electrical activity, almost as if awake. REM sleep is when most dreaming occurs, and when they are most vivid. During this phase, in our sleeping minds, we are transported. We see, hear, and feel. We experience things we would never experience in real life. We face the otherworldly and the supernatural. \n \n It is no wonder then that dreams have played a major role in the historical evolution of religions, says Patrick Mcnamara, a neurologist at Boston University, and Kelly Bulkeley, a Visiting Scholar at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley, California, in a new paper published to Frontiers in Psychology. \n \n Researchers working in many different parts of the world have found that people in traditional societies treat dreams as the sources of their religious ideas, including their concepts of their gods and other supernatural beings. It is likely that ancestral populations also treated them as such. Dreams were considered proof of the gods and a spirit realm since dreams were involuntary and emotionally vivid experiences that involved the dreamer\u2019s soul encountering other beings including long deceased relatives and so on. \n \n Why do people occasionally prescribe sacred status to figures in our dreams? One theory from evolutionary psychology holds that humans are inclined to presume intelligence or agency in unlikely places, as doing so might help recognize patterns that might have been missed, thus granting a better chance of survival. As the intuitive argument goes, it's better to assume the sound of a snapping twig was caused by a bear or a tiger, rather than just a falling branch. And so in dreams, we might be more likely to assume that advice or warning from a talking tree or a burning bush comes from a higher being who's looking out for us -- it's not merely meaningless drivel. \n \n Dreams offer, perhaps, the perfect setting to \"converse\" with a deity, Bulkeley and Mcnamara say, for three major reasons. First, dreams bring forth \"mental stimulations of alternate realities.\" Second, they are replete with theory of mind attributions, in which we attribute mental states to other beings or entities. And third, they allow us to give value or significance to our experiences. \"The neurobiology of... sleep states is now understood to involve forebrain mesocortical dopaminergic systems that directly compute value and dis-value,\" Bulkeley and Mcnamara write. \n \n Considering these factors, Bulkeley and Mcnamara reach an intriguing conclusion. \n \n \"All humans are endowed with brains innately primed to daily generate god concepts in dreaming.\" \n \n Source: Mcnamara P and Bulkeley K (2015).

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Religions throughout the world\u2014and throughout history\u2014have put dreams at the center of their belief systems, and researchers say there's a good reason for that. We do much of our intense dreaming during REM sleep, when the highly active brain acts almost like it's awake, writes Ross Pomeroy at Real Clear Science. All that activity can lead to dreamed situations that feel very real\u2014in some cases, even religious. In a new paper in Frontiers in Psychology, a neurologist and theological scholar argue that dreams are well-suited to create experiences in which we believe we've spoken to a deity of some kind. That is in part due to the feeling of an alternative reality we get in dreams, the researchers say. What's more, in dreams, we often ascribe emotions and thoughts to those we believe we're encountering. We give them an \"exaggerated degree of agency\" because our dreaming brains have trouble understanding our thoughts as our own, the researchers write. The researchers also note that unclear boundaries between REM sleep and wakefulness can be linked to schizophrenia\u2014but at Gizmodo, Annalee Newitz notes that the feeling of \"hearing voices\" may not necessarily mean a person is dealing with mental illness. A recent survey found that 15% of respondents who say they've heard voices have no diagnosis of disorder, and the \"hearing\" involved isn't necessarily auditory; the voices may not feel as though they're external at all, researchers say.

NASA released a new video describing the sun's magnetic flip on Monday (Aug. 5). \n \n \"It looks like we're no more than three to four months away from a complete field reversal,\" Todd Hoeksema, the director of Stanford University's Wilcox Solar Observatory, said in a statement. \"This change will have ripple effects throughout the solar system.\" \n \n As the field shifts, the \"current sheet\" \u2014 a surface that radiates billions of kilometers outward from the sun's equator \u2014 becomes very wavy, NASA officials said.

The transition from a wave to a dip can create stormy space weather around Earth, NASA officials said. \n \n The sun's magnetic field is gearing up to shift, a once in 11 year event, according to NASA officials. Credit: NASA \n \n \"The sun's polar magnetic fields weaken, go to zero, and then emerge again with the opposite polarity,\" Stanford solar physicist Phil Scherrer said in a statement. \"This is a regular part of the solar cycle.\" \n \n While the polarity shift can stir up some stormy weather, it also provides extra shielding from dangerous cosmic rays. These high-energy particles, which are accelerated by events like supernova explosions, zip through the universe at nearly the speed of light. They can harm satellites and astronauts in space, and the wrinkled current sheet better protects the planet from these particles. \n \n The effects of the rippled sheet can also be felt throughout the solar system, far beyond Pluto and even touching the Voyager probes near the barrier of interstellar space. \n \n \"The sun's north pole has already changed sign, while the south pole is racing to catch up,\" Scherrer said. \"Soon, however, both poles will be reversed, and the second half of solar max will be underway.\" \n \n The current solar maximum is the weakest in 100 years, experts have said. Usually, at the height of a solar cycle, sunspot activity increases. These dark regions on the sun's surface can give birth to solar flares and ejections, but there have been fewer observed sunspots this year than in the maximums of previous cycles. \n \n Follow Miriam Kramer @mirikramer and Google+. Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook and Google+. Original article on SPACE.com. ||||| Get ready, Earth. The sun's magnetic field is about to do a 180 when the celestial body's electromagnetism flips and changes polarity. \n \n According to NASA-supported observations, the complete reversal is expected to take place in the coming months. \n \n \"It looks like we're no more than three to four months away from a complete field reversal,\" Todd Hoeksema, a solar physicist and director of Stanford University's Wilcox Solar Observatory, said in a statement released by the agency. \"This change will have ripple effects throughout the solar system.\" \n \n So should we be concerned about the reversal of the sun's magnetic field? \n \n History says no. \n \n While the field reversal is a big event for the solar system, the change in polarity is rather routine. The magnetic flip takes place at the peak of each solar cycle every 11 years. Nearing the mid-point of the sun's 24th observed solar cycle, the star's south pole will soon follow the north's lead and change its magnetic sign. \n \n The change in polarity will have certain effects throughout the heliosphere -- the sun's domain, which extends well beyond Pluto -- but, as NASA notes in its ScienceCasts video, one of the largest effects Earth can expect is some stormy space weather around the planet. Astronauts in orbit may also see some changes in cosmic rays, which could be a potential danger. \n \n The 11-year cycle governs the level of solar activity on the sun. This year, during the peak of the cycle when solar activity is the strongest, the flip will be accompanied by increased levels of turbulence, such as sunspots. \n \n However, as solar physicists have pointed out, 2013's cycle peak has turned out to be one of the weakest observed in the past century, with relatively minimal activity. \n \n Watch NASA's ScienceCasts video below for a thorough explanation of the magnetic field reversal. \n \n Clarification: The sun has gone through 24 solar cycles since scientists began recording solar activity.",

(With the vice president in the mix, Clinton stood at 38 percent, Sanders at 27 percent and Biden at 20 percent.) \n \n Thursday's less favorable results are unlikely to surprise many in her Brooklyn headquarters: People close to Clinton's camp have recently been warning that Sanders could win both Iowa and New Hampshire before her massive organizing infrastructure kicks in among the next wave of nominating contests on March 1, when Clinton hopes to sew up the nomination. Her allies have also long noted that no non-incumbent candidate has broken the 50 percent mark in the Iowa caucuses other than Iowa's own Tom Harkin in 1992. \n \n But the new Quinnipiac poll is nonetheless likely to send shockwaves through the Democratic establishment, which is increasingly nervous about Clinton's inability to put the email flap to rest, and worried about her seeming difficulty connecting with voters. \n \n The fact that Thursday's result effectively shows a tie will hardly quiet the doubters, particularly given Clinton's heavy investment in her Iowa field operation \u2014 she has 78 paid organizers in the state, compared with more than 50 for Sanders \u2014 and her consistent lead until now. \n \n A wide range of donors and strategists close to Clinton have expressed their dissatisfaction with her response to questions about her email use. But many in and around the Brooklyn headquarters said on Tuesday and Wednesday that Clinton's forthright apology \u2014 she told ABC News' David Muir on Tuesday, \"That was a mistake. I\u2019m sorry about that. I take responsibility.\" \u2014 could help stanch the bleeding. \n \n Clinton supporters can take some solace in her enduring advantage among Iowa's women. Clinton leads Sanders to 49 percent to 35 percent among female likely caucus-goers, with 9 percent for Biden; though among men, Sanders leads 49 percent to 28 percent, with 16 percent for Biden. \n \n And she remains popular with Iowa Democrats as a whole. Likely caucus participants said they have a favorable view of Clinton by 76 percent to 20 percent, earning trustworthiness marks of 64 percent to 30 percent and 78 percent to 18 percent saying she cares about their problems. By a count of 92 percent to 7 percent, voters said the former secretary of state has strong leadership qualities and 89 percent said she had the right temperament to tackle an international crisis, compared with 9 percent who did not think so. \n \n But Sanders fares better. He drew a higher net favorability rating of +72 points (78 percent to 6 percent), and a higher share (86 percent to 4 percent) of those saying he is trustworthy than they did of Clinton. By a count of 85 percent to 5 percent, people said the senator cares about their issues. Asked about Sanders' leadership qualities, 76 percent said they were strong, compared to 9 percent who said they were not. On his temperament in times of crisis, voters approved of him by 65 percent to 15 percent. \n \n Biden drew a net favorability rating of +70 points (79 percent to 9 percent), while 91 percent said he is honest and trustworthy, compared to 5 percent who did not think so. By a count of 84 percent to 11 percent, likely caucus-goers said Biden cares about the needs and problems of people like them. On the leadership front, 81 percent to 14 percent gave him high marks, while in terms of his ability to handle crises, 81 percent to 13 percent said they approved of his capabilities. \n \n A majority of those surveyed \u2014 54 percent to 33 percent \u2014 said that they would rather the party's candidate have experience in Washington than not. \n \n The poll was conducted in the weeks around Labor Day, from Aug. 27-Sept. 8, surveying 832 likely Democratic caucus participants in the Hawkeye State via landlines and cellphones, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. ||||| September 10, 2015 - Sanders 41 To Clinton 40 In Iowa Democratic Caucus, Quinnipiac University Poll Finds; Dems Say Sanders Is More Honest And Caring \n \n PDF format \n \n \n \n Additional Trend Information \n \n \n \n In a come-from-behind rally, U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont is the choice of 41 percent of Iowa likely Democratic Caucus participants, with 40 percent picking former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and 12 percent backing Vice President Joseph Biden, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released today. \n \n \n \n \n \n This compares to results of a July 2 survey by the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe- ack) University showing Clinton at 52 percent, with 33 percent for Sanders and 7 percent for Biden. \n \n \n \n \n \n Today, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley gets 3 percent of Iowa likely Democratic Caucus participants, with 3 percent undecided. \n \n \n \n \n \n There is a wide gender gap among Democrats today as Sanders leads Clinton 49 - 28 percent among men, with 16 percent for Biden, while Clinton leads Sanders 49 - 35 percent among women, with 9 percent for Biden. \n \n \n \n \n \n Sanders and Biden have a higher net favorability rating than Clinton and higher ratings for honesty and empathy. Clinton has the best scores for leadership and temperament to handle an international crisis. \n \n \n \n \n \n \"Sen. Bernie Sanders has become the Eugene McCarthy of 2016,\" said Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll. \"He is the candidate of the Democratic left, against his own party's bosses and their prized presidential candidate, Secretary Hillary Clinton. \n \n \n \n \n \n \"Sanders has seized the momentum by offering a message more in line with disproportionately liberal primary and caucus voters.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \"But unlike the late Sen. McCarthy, who came on strong just before the 1968 primaries, Sen. Sanders has seized the momentum, five months before voting begins in Iowa. History will eventually tell us whether he has made such a large move too soon,\" Brown added. \n \n \n \n \n \n \"Although Vice President Joseph Biden received only 12 percent of the vote in this poll of likely Democratic Caucus-goers, he still may be a winner in the zero-sum game of presidential primary politics because it further increases questions about Clinton's electability.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n Clinton has a 76 - 20 percent favorability rating among likely Democratic Caucus participants, as these voters say 64 - 30 percent that she is honest and trustworthy, and 78 - 18 percent that she cares about their needs and problems. She has strong leadership qualities, voters say 92 - 7 percent, and the right temperament and personality to handle an international crisis, voters say 89 - 9 percent. \n \n \n \n \n \n Sanders gets a 78 - 6 percent favorability rating and likely Democratic Caucus-goers say 86 - 4 percent that he is honest and trustworthy, and 85 - 5 percent that he cares about their needs and problems. Voters say 76 - 9 percent that he has strong leadership qualities and 65 - 15 percent that he has the right temperament and personality to handle an international crisis. \n \n \n \n \n \n Iowa likely Democratic Caucus participants give Biden a 79 - 9 percent favorability rating. He is honest and trustworthy, voters say 91 - 5 percent, and cares about their needs and problems, voters say 84 - 11 percent. He has strong leadership qualities, voters say 81 - 14 percent and the right temperament and personality for an international crisis, voters say 81 - 13 percent. \n \n \n \n \n \n Iowa Democrats support the nuclear pact with Iran 66 - 19 percent and say 68 - 17 percent that the agreement will make the world safer. \n \n \n \n \n \n From August 27 - September 8, Quinnipiac University surveyed 832 likely Iowa Democratic Caucus participants with a margin of error of +/- 3.4 percentage points. Live interviewers call land lines and cell phones. \n \n \n \n \n \n The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts public opinion surveys in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and the nation as a public service and for research. \n \n \n \n \n \n For more information, visit http://www.quinnipiac.edu/polling, call (203) 582-5201, or follow us on Twitter @QuinnipiacPoll. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3.

Do you think the United States and its allies are winning or losing the fight against ISIS? ||||| Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton just endorsed a policy that, if implemented, could give a huge advantage to her primary opponent Bernie Sanders. \n \n On Tuesday, Clinton laid out a broad plan for curbing the influence of money in politics that includes everything from overturning the Supreme Court\u2019s Citzens United ruling to introducing new disclosure rules for federal contractors donating to campaigns. But one of the more interesting parts of the proposal is Secretary Clinton\u2019s endorsement of a small dollar-matching contributions system. \n \n Under such a system, donations made to a campaign beneath a certain dollar amount would be \u201cmatched\u201d by the federal government in order to strengthen the political power of small dollar donors and dilute the influence of wealthy donors who can make large contributions. One of the effects of such a system is that it would substantially strengthen the fundraising power of campaigns like that of Bernie Sanders, which rely on aggregating a large amount of small donations from a broad base of donors. \n \n During the last round of FEC filings, Politico reported that the Sanders campaign drew 67% of its $13.6 million haul from donations of $200 or less. By contrast, the Clinton campaign drew only 18% of its $47 million in fundraising from donations of $200 or less. If a matching contribution limit was set at $200 and the matching rate was six to one (similar to the rates under a plan currently proposed in Congress) Sanders\u2019 totals would more than quadruple while Clinton\u2019s funds would less than double. \n \n With new polling out that shows Bernie Sanders leading Hillary Clinton by 9 points among likely primary voters in New Hampshire, that kind of shift in fundraising dynamics could have a dramatic impact on the outcome of the Democratic nominating contest. Such a policy, however, is unlikely to pass Congress before the 2016 general election, let alone after. \n \n Clinton\u2019s endorsement of multiple matching contributions comes on the same day that Sanders\u2019 campaign launched a big push for small dollar donations in honor of the candidate\u2019s 74th birthday.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A Quinnipiac poll out today brings an unwelcome milestone for Hillary Clinton: She trails for the first time in Iowa to Bernie Sanders, 41% to 40%. That's within the poll's margin of error but still a notable shift from July, when she was way out in front 52% to 33%. Previous polls have shown that Sanders also is leading in New Hampshire, and with all the usual caveats about early-state polls, the two taken together should give the Clinton camp plenty to think about. Here's a sampling of reaction: Time: Sanders' \"rapid gain on Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire reflects broader concern among liberal Democrats with economic inequality, college affordability, healthcare and campaign finance reform, issues that Sanders has trumpeted throughout his campaign.\" Politico: The \"shift is a significant one, coming on the heels of polls showing Sanders edging Clinton in New Hampshire, too. Together, the results suggest a candidate reeling from the controversy over her emails and struggling to put down a rebellion on her left flank.\" CNN: \"For Clinton, the poll will come as a sharp reminder of her 2008 race, when she also faltered in Iowa despite her once-inevitable nominee status.\" Click to read about a plan Clinton endorses\u2014that could actually give Sanders a big edge.",

Another 12% said they would support Joe Biden, and no other candidate cracked the 3% mark. The Iowa poll is the latest in a string of troubling polls for Clinton, who is still the front-runner but is \" reeling from the controversy over her emails and struggling to put down a rebellion,\" Politico notes.",

British Airways canceled all flights from London's Heathrow and Gatwick... (Associated Press) \n \n LONDON (AP) \u2014 Travelers on British Airways and its sister airlines in Spain faced a third day of delays and cancellations Monday, mainly on short-haul flights in Europe, after the company suffered a colossal IT failure over the weekend. \n \n BA chief executive Alex Cruz said that the airline was running a \"near-full operation\" at London's Gatwick Airport and planned to operate all scheduled long-haul services from Heathrow. But he said there would still be delays, as well as some canceled short-haul flights. \n \n Data from flight tracker FlightAware.com showed BA's sister airlines in Spain, Iberia and Air Nostrum, cancelled over 320 flights on Monday, a bank holiday in the U.K. that sees a high level of air travel. \n \n BA itself canceled another 27 flights and had 117 more delayed Monday. \n \n The airline, which is part of the broader International Airlines Group, canceled all flights from Heathrow and Gatwick on Saturday after the IT outage, which it blamed on a power-supply problem. The glitch threw the plans of tens of thousands of travelers into disarray. \n \n Cruz told Sky News Monday the problem started at 9:30 Saturday morning when \"there was indeed a power surge that had a catastrophic effect over some communications hardware which eventually affected all the messaging across our systems.\" \n \n He said there was no evidence indicating the airline had come under cyberattack. \n \n BA operates hundreds of flights from Heathrow and Gatwick on a typical day \u2014 and both are major hubs for worldwide travel. \n \n Passengers, some of whom had spent the night at London's Heathrow Airport, faced frustrating waits to learn if and when they could fly out. \n \n Some endured hours-long lines to check in, reclaim lost luggage or rebook flights at Terminal 5, BA's hub at Heathrow. Many complained about a lack of information from the airline. \n \n Cruz apologized in a video statement, saying: \"I know this has been a horrible time for customers.\" \n \n The British union GMB linked the IT problems directly to the company's decision to cut IT staff last year. \n \n \"This could have all been avoided. In 2016, BA made hundreds of dedicated and loyal IT staff redundant and outsourced the work to India,\" said Mick Rix, national officer for aviation at the union. ||||| Ryanair is making hay while the sun is not shining on British Airways. \n \n BA customers are facing a third day of travel disruption because of a breakdown in the airline's computer system. \n \n And Ryanair is making no attempt to hide its schadenfreude: \n \n \"Meanwhile, over at the @ British_Airways IT department...\" said a tweet on the official Ryanair account, along with the hashtag #ShouldHaveFlownRyanair. \n \n \"Breaking news: BA appoints new head of IT,\" said another tweet which was pinned to Ryanair's page. \n \n Ouch. \n \n Some people saw the funny side: \n \n @Ryanair I am crying this is bloody brilliant \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \u2014 Dannii (@Dannii_BJROE) May 28, 2017 \n \n Others didn't: \n \n @Ryanair Isn't this a bit like a run down corner shop poking fun at Sainsbury's? \u2014 Jon Cook (@JonCook188) May 28, 2017 \n \n @Ryanair Oh the irony @Ryanair the company with THE worst customer service known to man ... flew once 11 years ago, vowed never again .. and haven't \u2014 Sean Elkins (@seanieboyelkins) May 29, 2017 \n \n British Airways said 75,000 customers were affected by the technical glitch over the weekend but denied the failure was because the company outsourced its IT operations. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images \n \n British Airways is working to restore its computer systems after a power failure caused major disruption for thousands of passengers worldwide. \n \n The airline is \"closer to full operational capacity\" after an IT power cut resulted in mass flight cancellations at Heathrow and Gatwick. \n \n Thousands of passengers remain displaced, with large numbers sleeping overnight in terminals. \n \n BA has not explained the cause of the power problem. \n \n So far on Monday, 13 short-haul flights at Heathrow have been cancelled. \n \n Heathrow advised affected BA passengers not to travel to the airport unless their flights had been rebooked, or were scheduled to take off today. \n \n Passengers on cancelled flights have been told to use the BA website to rebook. \n \n Chief executive Alex Cruz has posted videos on Twitter apologising for what he called a \"horrible time for passengers\". \n \n But no-one from the airline has been made available to answer questions about the system crash, and it has not explained why there was no back-up system in place. \n \n Cancellations and delays affected thousands of passengers at both Heathrow and Gatwick on Saturday. \n \n All flights operated from Gatwick on Sunday but more than a third of services from Heathrow - mostly to short-haul destinations - were cancelled. \n \n Passengers slept on yoga mats handed out by the airline as conference rooms were opened to provide somewhere more comfortable to rest. \n \n What went wrong at BA? \n \n Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent \n \n Image copyright Getty Images \n \n BA blames a power cut, but a corporate IT expert said it should not have caused \"even a flicker of the lights\" in the data-centre. \n \n Even if the power could not be restored, the airline's Disaster Recovery Plan should have whirred into action. But that will have depended in part on veteran staff with knowledge of the complex patchwork of systems built up over the years. \n \n Many of those people may have left when much of the IT operation was outsourced to India. \n \n One theory of the IT expert, who does not wish to be named, is that when the power came back on the systems were unusable because the data was unsynchronised. \n \n In other words the airline was suddenly faced with a mass of conflicting records of passengers, aircraft and baggage movements - all the complex logistics of modern air travel. \n \n Read the full blog \n \n BA said it operated virtually all scheduled long-haul flights on Sunday, but the knock-on effects of Saturday's disruption resulted in a reduced short-haul programme. \n \n \"We apologise again to customers for the frustration and inconvenience they are experiencing and thank them for their continued patience.\" \n \n Ian Sanderson, one of the affected passengers who is stuck in transit in London, said he was \"incandescent with rage\" after being unable to rebook his flight, or speak to a member of staff. \n \n Image copyright Twitter Image caption Thousands of customers have taken to Twitter to vent their frustration \n \n Speaking on Sunday evening, he said: \"I've bombarded them with about 100 tweets in the last 24 hours. I know that's annoying but there's nothing else I can do. \n \n \"We've tried to call them on the numbers they give and all we've got is the same recorded message which then cuts off at the end.\" \n \n Former Virgin Airlines spokesman Paul Charles said: \"What seems remarkable is there was no back-up system kicking in within a few minutes system failing. \n \n \"Businesses of this type need systems backing up all the time, and this is what passengers expect.\" \n \n 'Extraordinary circumstances' \n \n BA is liable to reimburse thousands of passengers for refreshments and hotel expenses, and travel industry commentators have suggested the cost to the company - part of Europe's largest airline group IAG - could run into tens of millions of pounds. \n \n Shares in IAG listed on the Madrid stock exchange are currently trading down by about 3%. \n \n Customers displaced by flight cancellations can claim up to \u00a3200 a day for a room (based on two people sharing), \u00a350 for transport between the hotel and airport, and \u00a325 a day per adult for meals and refreshments. \n \n Consumer expert Franky Brehany said travellers stranded in a \"high-value city\" like London may be able to claim more and should keep all receipts. \n \n But he added that it might be harder for passengers to claim compensation, as BA may blame \"extraordinary circumstances\" - \"like an act of God or force majeure\" - meaning the airline would only have to reimburse hotel and food costs. \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Queues built up on Sunday at Heathrow Terminal 5 as passengers waited to speak to BA staff \n \n Image copyright Getty Images \n \n Thousands of bags remain at Heathrow Airport, but BA has advised passengers not to return to collect them, saying they will be couriered to customers. \n \n The airline said there was no evidence the computer failure was the result of a cyber-attack. It denied claims by the GMB union that the problem could be linked to the company outsourcing its IT work. \n \n Gatwick Airport said it was continuing to advise customers travelling with British Airways to check the status of their flight with the airline before travelling to the airport. \n \n EU flight delay rights",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's close but no cigar for British Airways. The airline has fully restored all its long-haul services out of Heathrow following Saturday's crippling IT failure, but Monday marks the third day of related delays and cancellations, particularly when it comes to short-haul flights. The AP reports BA axed 27 flights on Monday, and sister airlines Iberia and Air Nostrum cancelled more than 320. The airline didn't offer much in the way of details until Monday when in an interview with Sky News, CEO Alex Cruz faulted a power surge. The Independent reports Cruz also said the backup system didn't kick in as it should have. Cruz brushed away a British union's assertions that the root of the IT issue stretches back a year, when \"hundreds\" of IT staffers lost their jobs, per the union GMB, with the work outsourced to India. Cruz countered that \"they've all been local issues around a local data center who have been managed and fixed by local resources.\" But that doesn't stop the BBC from speculating that for BA's \"Disaster Recovery Plan\" to have worked, \"veteran staff with knowledge of the complex patchwork of systems built up over the years\" would be key, and it's possible some of those people left during last year's shift to India.

    "document": "It was an ethical dilemma straight from the textbooks: Imagine you and two of your friends find a small fortune of cash inside a crummy old couch you bought for cheap at a second-hand shop. Would you trace the money back to its owner, or would you keep it to spend on your heart\u2019s deepest desires? A SUNY New Paltz student and two friends dealt with this dilemma firsthand early March 2014. \n \n Third-year geology student Reese Werkhoven, Mount Holyoke College graduate Cally Guasti, and SUNY New Paltz graduate Lara Russo were getting cozy on their new couch for the first time when Werkhoven found a plastic envelope under the couch\u2019s patchy arm. \n \n \u201cI almost peed,\u201d Werkhoven said. Inside the envelope was a wad of twenties that added up to $700. \n \n \u201cThe most money I\u2019d ever found in a couch was like fifty cents. Honestly, I\u2019d be ecstatic to find just $5 in a couch.\u201d \n \n The group began a thorough excavation, maneuvering the couch in all directions so that every linty crevice could be probed to find more money. \n \n \u201cJust when we thought we pulled out the last envelope we\u2019d find another $1,000 a few minutes later,\u201d said Guasti. \n \n Twenty minutes after sitting on an old, musky couch, three college students were now miraculously standing on $40,000 in cash. \n \n For a while, there were no notes, no names, or anything else that could have told them who the money belonged to. For all they knew the money was fair game. \n \n ~ \n \n Then there was a game changer. Russo found a woman\u2019s name on one of the envelopes. \n \n \u201cWe had a lot of moral discussions about the money,\u201d Russo said. \u201cWe all agreed that we had to bring the money back to whoever it belonged to\u2026 it\u2019s their money\u2013 we didn\u2019t earn it. However, there were a lot of gray areas we had to consider.\u201d \n \n Each of them called their parents for advice;. Their parents basically told them all the same thing: \n \n Don\u2019t spend the money. Don\u2019t tell anyone about the money. Find the woman from the envelope. Find out if it\u2019s her money. \n \n Questions came into focus. \n \n What if the money had belonged to a homicidal drug dealer? What if it was all counterfeit? What if the person who owned the money was dead? Who should they trust to give it to in their name? What if the person is just a really bad person? \n \n Russo pondered the last question on the phone with her mother. \u201cMy mom said that I have a good moral compass, and if I don\u2019t think that someone is a good person, or deserving of the money, then I\u2019m not obligated to give it to them. This really threw me off. Where do you draw the line? It\u2019s all very subjective.\u201d \n \n The possibilities were endless and the group seemingly discussed them all that night. Though they weren\u2019t banking on it, there was still a chance they\u2019d be able to keep some or all of the money. \n \n \u201cI would have bought my mom a new car,\u201d Werkhoven said. \u201cWhat she drives is a piece of junk, and I really wanted to surprise her with a brand-new car.\u201d \n \n Other items high on the wish lists: paying back student loans and traveling the world. \n \n Keeping the big secret \n \n The next morning, Russo and Guasti were at work, Werkhoven was at class, and all of them had a huge secret they couldn\u2019t share with anyone. \n \n Then around 11 a.m., Werkhoven\u2019s mom called and told him that she found the woman\u2019s name in the phone book. After work Werkhoven gave the woman a call. \n \n He asked the woman her name and told her he had just bought a couch from Salvation Army. \n \n She immediately replied, \u201cOh, I left a lot of money in that couch.\u201d \n \n Werkhoven promised her that he and his housemates would be able to return the money at any time, but he was a little taken aback by her shortness with him on the phone. \n \n Returning the money \n \n In the late afternoon, Werkhoven, Guasti and Russo were in the car headed to the woman\u2019s house in the Hudson Valley. \n \n \u201cAbout halfway to her house we stopped the car and had a serious discussion\u2026what if she\u2019s a really bad person? What can we do at this point if we meet her and decide we don\u2019t want to give her the money?\u201d \n \n Not having a plan of exit, they rolled up the long driveway past three \u201cbeware of dog\u201d signs and several mounted cameras. \n \n It was a rustic home in a rough neighborhood. The porch was grey and chipping paint. The front door creaked open slowly, Werkhoven remembered. \n \n \u201cI think the part of this whole experience that cleared away my prior thoughts and worries was when I saw the woman\u2019s daughter and granddaughter greet us at the door,\u201d Werkhoven said. \u201cI could just tell right away that these were nice people.\u201d \n \n \u201cWhen we handed the money back to the woman, she told us that she felt like her husband was present in the room with us,\u201d Guasti said. \n \n In an interview, the woman, who asked not to be identified, explained how her money was lost. \n \n Her husband had had a heart condition and knew his time was limited. Before he died, he gave her money each week to put away for when he passed. For 30 years she stored her savings inside an old couch in the television room where she slept. When her husband passed away, she remained working as a florist and continued to store her money in the couch until she had an operation on her back and went to a rehabilitation center for several months. \n \n Upon the doctor\u2019s advice, the woman\u2019s daughter and son-in-law replaced the couch she slept on with a full-size bed. \n \n The couch ended up at the Salvation Army store in New Paltz and was bought for $20 by three genuinely good young people who had the strength and wherewithal to make a commendable moral decision. \n \n \u201cWe almost didn\u2019t pick that couch,\u201d Russo said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty ugly and smells, but it was the only couch that fit the right dimensions for our living room.\u201d \n \n The woman gave $1,000 to Guasti, Russo and Werkhoven as a reward for returning the $40,000. ||||| NEW PALTZ, N.Y.

    "document": "Sony had an event today and as expected, it introduced the PlayStation 4. The next-gen platform is designed to shift focus from the living room to the gamer, Sony said, and overall, PlayStation\u2019s approach is meant to make it possible for gamers to play wherever they want, whenever they want. \n \n PS4 lead system architect Mark Cerny talked about how the evolution of the PS4 came about, saying it began five years ago, earlier on in the life of the PS3. The PS3 was a first step, which was designed to connect to a variety of services, but it was limited because of how early it launched in that world, Cerny said. \n \n \u201cMuch less value is found today in blast processing or a system-on-a-chip,\u201d Cerny said. He suggested tech could interfere with design innovation. The tech remains important, he stressed, but the idea was to create a platform that was all about experience. Sound familiar? That\u2019s because it\u2019s a tune Apple and Steve Jobs started playing years ago when they realized the spec race was a nonstarter in the mobile phone world. \n \n \u201cBy game creators, for game creators. It is a powerful and accessible system,\u201d Cerny said on stage, suggesting that this time around there was a strong emphasis on ease of development, hence the use of a standard x86 PC CPU. The GPU is designed for use with \u201cpractical tasks,\u201d he said, with the overall goal of making development a painless experience. \n \n Essentially, the PS4 is an advanced, x86-based personal computer, which means that it should be easy for developers to build. All of this is clearly an answer to a major complaint from studios about the previous generation, which was infamously tricky to master from a software perspective. \n \n Sony also unveiled a redesigned DualShock 4 controller, which has the Vita-style touchpad depicted in rumors, ad works with a 3D \u201cstereo\u201d camera accessory to track its movements in a loose approximation of what\u2019s possible with Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Kinect. \n \n The hardware is clearly also borrowing some tricks from mobile games. It has save states that allow users to quickly freeze and resume gameplay, without having to save just by switching on and off the console. There\u2019s also background downloading, which allows digital titles to be played before they\u2019re even completely on your local drive. \n \n Social is another key tentpole for the PS4, according to Cerny. He described a new function that allows you to quickly pause and upload gameplay videos as easily as you might have done with static screenshots in the past. There\u2019s also spectator functionality for watching \u201ccelebrities\u201d gaming, something which seems to have been borrowed from Twitter\u2019s success with famous members. Networking will also be based around real names and profile pictures, instead of strictly on gamer tags and avatars, too, and all of this will plug into mobile apps to help gamers stay in touch. ||||| It's been seven years since the giant, boxy, expensive, hugely-fun and hyped PS3 first arrived. Seven years is a long time. But the next expensive, gorgeous era of gaming is here: the PlayStation 4. Everything looks better, yes, but it's definitely more of the same. \n \n The PS4, arriving in stores \"Holiday 2013,\" is still very much a PC in terms of guts: an x86 processor, an 8-core combined CPU/GPU, (we're not sure of exactly which one), and 8 GB of unified GDDR5 memory (versus the PS3's 512 megabytes). And for those of you who worry about storage\u2014don't, as the PS4 will have a local HDD (no word if there will be any solid state action). What does that mean for your eyeballs? \n \n A live demo of generic Unreal Engine 4 fiery destruction looked fantastic and fluid, at least on par with a high-end PC from today. A look at the next Killzone title was even more impressive, though we don't want to get our hopes up too much about what's pre-rendered here and what isn't. If it is, lighting effects look absolutely phenomenal, with better flames, glare, and shadows than anything on any console. \n \n But that's the idea, right? \n \n Cityscape scenes and view distance are pleasantly massive. \n \n Overall\u2014and this is based only on demos projected onto a screen, not a real game on a real TV in your real home\u2014the graphics are fantastic, but not of an OH MY HELL, nothing-else-like-it-even-close leap. Like, say, the first time you ever saw Sonic Adventure. A demo of Driveclub for PS4 wasn't appreciably better than the visuals you'd see on the latest Gran Turismo. I'd actually say it looked... the exact same. But we're not disappointed\u2014there are absolutely scenes we've seen so far that could've only been pre-rendered on a PS3 or Xbox 360 and this thing isn't even out yet. \n \n face \n \n \n \n A demo by Quantic Dream showing off realtime facial detail running straight off the PS4 was brilliant. And it was just a demo. Imagine this tech behind the team who made LA Noire. On the other hand, it's just a single guy's head floating in space, and a demo, at that. But his skin looked real, man. \n \n A demo of Capcom's PS4 \"Panta Rhei\" engine looked like a mix between pre-rendered PS3-splendid, and current-gen PC smooth. \n \n Spectacular lighting and facial graphics, once again. \n \n Some bad news: no native PS3 backwards compatibility. But! You'll have PlayStation Cloud, permitting streaming access to old titles without the need for discs. Sony is frustratingly mum on how PlayStation Cloud will actually work, though. \n \n The DualShock makes a return as well\u2014the DualShock 4\u2014sharing the same general design as its predecessors. But it'll now share a touchpad in the middle, a share button, a headphone jack, and perhaps most importantly, a light bar that'll track movement with a PlayStation Move-style controller. \n \n That means movement gestures baked right into your hand\u2014no need for a separate wand to wave around. Just one controller. \n \n There's also very impressive stuff going on in the background\u2014games will be \"instantly\" bootable from sleep, and a secondary processor will handle downloading games in the background, giving you the ability to actually play games while they're being transferred from Sony's servers to your PS4. This will be nice for anyone absolutely sick of PS3's historically bad download wait times. \n \n A dedicated video-processing chip will let you stream video from your gaming session without leaving your session, sharable straight from a social-oriented button on your controller. Your friends will actually be able ot watch you play from their won couches, remotely offering tips and banter. Or hell: ask a friend who's just better than you to take over your game from their controller and beat that horrible boss. UStream integration will mean your performance can be a public one if you'd like, too. \n \n All the usual streaming video apps\u2014Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, et al\u2014will be there. Just like PS3. \n \n The new social gaming interface looks decent, but Sony is pushing \"social integration\" pretty hard here (well beyond finding strangers to kill), and it's questionable how much anyone really wants a social network on their phones and tablets built around gaming. We already have too many. Luckily, Facebook will be integrated inside the PS4, connecting with the PlayStation Network to fill it out with the online life you've already been building, rather than tediously starting from scratch. \n \n Personalization is an interesting emphasis\u2014Sony says it'll study your downloading and playing habits to actually predict the next titles you'll want and download them ahead of time. Unless that's very smart, it's going to be very annoying. \n \n Remote play\u2014continuing where you left off on another screen\u2014will be another bullet point for the PS4. Expectedly, the Vita will be the go-to small-screen, with PS4 titles streaming straight to the Vita's 5-inch display. Unfortunately, it looks like it'll have to be wired, but Sony says the \"goal\" will be every single PS4 title playable on Vita. \n \n So what does it look like we have here (or will have) in the PS4? The PS3... but... more. Where the PS3 was fast, this is faster, pretty becomes prettier, everything a little expanded. It's a stiffer drink you've had before. \n \n Of course, no word on how much this thing will cost, and to our disappointment and exasperation, we have no idea what the console will look like. Maybe it's a pyramid. Bloody hell, Sony.",

In fact, they were speaking to a third-party, in another location, who was on the phone with police. \n \n A few hours before a Florida woman and her 8-year-old son were fatally shot last week, police responded to a domestic dispute between the woman and the suspect. \n \n Early on the morning of March 27, Sanford police were twice called to intervene between Latina Verneta Herring, 35, and Allen Dion Cashe, 31, who were quarreling over the keys to her house and car, according to an arrest report obtained by NBC affiliate WESH of Orlando and The Orlando Sentinel. \n \n About three hours later, around 6:30 a.m., Cashe emptied the magazine of an assault-style rifle, investigators said. Herring, who was shot seven times, died at the scene. Her 8-year-old son, Branden, was critically wounded; he died Tuesday.

    "document": "Are anti-NSA pranksters invading people's privacy? \n \n more stories from this episode \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Full Episode \n \n Civil liberties groups in the US say the National Security Agency's surveillance program amounts to illegal spying on innocent citizens. And now, a group of anonymous anti-NSA pranksters is trying to make a point about the surveillance of ordinary people by doing it themselves. \n \n Over the past year, they've hidden dozens of mini tape recorders under tables and benches around New York City, secretly taping people's conversations. This week, they launched a website where they've posted some of their recordings. They range from the mundane, like a woman at a gym talking about her plans for the evening, to the intimate, like a man at a restaurant talking about his lover's fetishes. \n \n The people behind this project claim to be contractors working for the NSA, even though their website links to the ACLU's instructions on how to urge Congress to repeal part of the Homeland Security Act. They say they've launched a new \"pro bono\" pilot program on behalf of the agency - despite not having been asked by the NSA to do this. We talk to one of the project's creators about what they're trying to achieve, and ask how recording and posting unsuspecting people's conversations without their consent can be justified. We agreed to withhold his identity at his request. \n \n This interview has been edited for clarity and length. \n \n Why have you asked us not to reveal your identity? \n \n Well, our operatives can really complete our mission with much greater efficiency if our identities are not known. \n \n Are you worried about legal repercussions for yourself and for the project? \n \n No. Our agents are not. \n \n But to be clear, what you're doing is against the law New York State, because to record a conversation, one person needs to give their consent to being taped. So why are you doing this? \n \n If people were really bothered by this type of surveillance, we imagine that they would be sending their their feelings towards their government representatives to respond to the NSA's tactics. And certainly what we've been hearing over and over again is, \"I'm not saying or doing anything wrong, so it's really fine if I am listened in on.\" So since we've heard the overwhelming response to the NSA's actions, we figured that we would step in and help with the NSA's actions. These people aren't doing anything wrong. They really have nothing to be concerned about and there should be no element of being surprised or hurt by an invasion of privacy. \n \n I think I understand the point you're trying to make about mass surveillance and about the NSA. But you're essentially trying to make that point by doing the same thing, which is violating people's privacy. \n \n You're certainly welcome to process it that way. We look at it as we're trying to keep the country and the world at large safe. Part of the freedoms that we're trying to protect are not just the freedoms of people's physical wellbeing, but people's freedoms to show dissent and speak up to power. We've given people a place at the site to express their dissatisfaction with with this type of surveillance. So if this type of surveillance really bothers them, there's really a way for people en masse to let their voices be heard and have this type of surveillance and data mining be stopped. \n \n And so as you go about conducting this \"surveillance,\" what are you doing to protect people's identities? \n \n We have not released anybody's first and last names on the recordings. Through our data collection, we have heard people give their bank account numbers to their customer service representatives at their banks. People talk about passwords to different services that they use online and we've deleted those and not made those public. We have not released anything that would compromise any particular individual. \n \n But you list the exact location of where the recorder was hidden and you're posting pictures of the locations too. Couldn't someone figure out who that person was, at a location talking about a specific thing? \n \n It's very interesting you say that, because the NSA can actually put together your whereabouts past, present and future with much less information than that. The NSA uses many, many, many third party contractors and we consider ourselves to be one of them, albeit in a freelance, pro bono non-official way. \n \n A not asked way. \n \n No, no one has asked us yet, but we feel pretty confident that the NSA would approve of our actions, since we're really trying to aid them in their efforts. \n \n What if someone hears themselves on your website wants you to take the clip down? What are you going to do? \n \n Well, there is an email address. So far, we haven't had that response. Our agents would have to really go over that and work on that on a case-by-case basis. So far, we haven't received any emails asking that to happen. And again, we have a place where people can vent their frustration to people much more powerful than us. We're a small organization. There's a big conversation happening and a debate and laws being changed on the Hill this week. So it would be a really good time for people to weigh in with their voices. \n \n There has been a long debate over privacy and the N.S.A. and CSIS, our spy agency here in Canada. What are you hoping that it's adding to the conversation? \n \n What we're hoping to add to the conversation is people to have an awareness of how even the most mundane conversation reveals quite a bit about your life, your patterns of behavior. But it seems that there are people who are aware of that, because they've said quite loudly, as I've said before, \"As long as I'm not doing anything wrong, I don't see why people have a problem with governments and their third party vendors that they work with knowing who I speak to, how often I speak to them, where I speak to them.\" And in some cases, you don't even really need to know and hear the conversation to know what you're speaking about. If the NSA understands that you're calling a doctor's office and a particular type of doctor over and over again, they don't need to listen to the details in the granular piece of those conversations to figure out what's going on in your life. \n \n What's most interesting thing that you've heard on these tapes? \n \n I don't think you have the security clearance to hear the most interesting pieces. And what's interesting to one might not be to another. So, that's really a judgment call that I'm not in a position to make. \n \n Okay you're helping the NS. do their job is what you're saying. \n \n Oh, absolutely. And we consider it a really important mission. But If the tactics and them completing their mission were deemed illegal or unconstitutional, we would immediately stop. \n \n Aren't you deceiving people? Your tape recorders actually say \"Property of the NSA.\" \n \n Well, we feel since we're working on behalf of the NSA, that we took the liberty to say that we're working for their mission, that this would be the best way to identify our devices. And if someone were to find one, we hope that they can just drop it in the mailbox somewhere and it would be delivered to the NSA and then that way, we can get our information even quicker to the NSA, rather than having to go to our website and listen to what we found they can get ahold of it that way. \n \n How would you feel if you were on the other side of this and one of your private conversations ended up online? \n \n I assume my private conversations are being listened to by many. That's an assumption that most people should make, that their private comings and goings are not are not completely between the people that they think they're having them with. ||||| A woman at a gym tells her friend she pays rent higher than $2,000 a month. An ex-Microsoft employee describes his work as an artist to a woman he's interviewing to be his assistant\u2014he makes paintings and body casts, as well as something to do with infrared light that\u2019s hard to discern from his foreign accent. Another man describes his gay lover\u2019s unusual sexual fetish, which involves engaging in fake fistfights, \u201clike we were doing a scene from Batman Returns.\" \n \n These conversations\u2014apparently real ones, whose participants had no knowledge an eavesdropper might be listening\u2014were recorded and published by the NSA. Well, actually no, not the NSA, but an anonymous group of anti-NSA protestors claiming to be contractors of the intelligence agency and launching a new \"pilot program\" in New York City on its behalf. That spoof of a pilot program, as the prankster provocateurs describe and document in videos on their website, involves planting micro-cassette recorders under tables and benches around New York city, retrieving the tapes and embedding the resulting audio on their website: Wearealwayslistening.com. \n \n A note, tape recorder and USB drive anonymously sent to WIRED's New York office. The USB drive contained a video showing one of the recorders being stealthily planted under a table. \n \n \"Eavesdropping on the population has revealed many saying 'I\u2019m not doing anything wrong so who cares if the NSA tracks what I say and do?' Citizens don\u2019t seem to mind this monitoring, so we\u2019re hiding recorders in public places in hopes of gathering information to help win the war on terror,\" reads a message on the project's website. \"We've started with NYC as a pilot program, but hope to roll the initiative out all across The Homeland.\" \n \n Another page of the project's website embeds the audio from five of those surreptitious recordings of New Yorkers' conversations, including the ones described above. The group likely has many hours more of surveillance tape from the low-tech spy bugs they've scattered around the city. \n \n The project\u2019s creators have chosen to remain anonymous, no doubt in part to avoid the legal controversy surrounding secret recordings of private conversations under New York law. But they tipped off WIRED to their work in an encrypted email a day ahead of their project\u2019s launch Wednesday. They say they've planted dozens of the microcassette recorders around New York over the last year. \"The NSA employs many 3rd party contractors, [and] we consider ourselves to be contractors of this nature, albeit in a unpaid and unsanctioned capacity,\" reads the email. \"We can attest to the fact all people recorded are NOT actors and are not knowingly involved in the project in any way.\" \n \n That anonymous email was followed by an envelope sent to WIRED\u2019s New York office containing a single page with the printed words \u201cWe\u2019re listening as you read this,\u201d along with the group's website url. Inside the envelope was also one of the group's tape recorders (without a tape) and a USB stick containing the video below, which shows one of the recorders being surreptitiously planted under a restaurant table, marked with the words \"PROPERTY OF NSA.\" \n \n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxJgK0ND2DY&feature=youtu.be \n \n A link on the We Are Always Listening site makes clear the project's larger political purpose: The word \"Angry?\" in the site's menu connects to a page on the ACLU's website that asks Americans to protest the renewal of Patriot Act, whose deadline looms on June 1. The ACLU page asks voters to petition Congress in particular to allow the 215 Section of the law to sunset, which would end the bulk collection of metadata about Americans' communications, revealed in the first published leak of classified material by NSA contractor Edward Snowden. \n \n A spoofed NSA logo created by the group. Its latin translates to \"We Are Always Listening.\" \n \n Despite that link, ACLU spokesperson Stacy Sullivan tells WIRED that the group isn't affiliated with the people behind the eavesdropping prank, though the ACLU did grant them permission to link to the group's petition page. Sullivan wouldn't say whether she knew the creators' identities. The NSA didn't immediately respond to WIRED's request for comment. \n \n The recordings posted to the site don't name any of the eavesdropped speakers. But they do include the locations where the recordings were made, which could provide just enough information to identify some of those speakers. And regardless of anonymity, the prank is likely illegal: Secretly recording a conversation in New York requires the consent of at least one of the people recorded\u2014a tape recorder planted under a table and retrieved later certainly doesn't qualify. \n \n Of the five recordings published on the project's website so far, three of the recorders used to get them remain in place, and an untold number of others could still be planted around the city. So, careful what you say in public, New Yorkers\u2014unless, of course, you have nothing to hide.",

But a law enforcement official said a manifesto of several pages had been recovered. \n \n Bonnie Schaan, the mother of 16-year-old Cheyeanne Fitzgerald, said she was told by her 16-year-old daughter that the gunman gave someone an envelope and told him to go to a corner of the classroom. \n \n Harper-Mercer said the person \"'was going to be the lucky one,'\" Schaan told reporters outside a hospital where her daughter's kidney was removed after she was shot. \n \n Relatives of other survivors of the shooting that killed nine also said Harper-Mercer gave something to a student in the class. \n \n Pastor Randy Scroggins, whose 18-year-old daughter Lacey escaped without physical injuries, said she told him that the gunman called to a student, saying: \"'Don't worry, you're the one who is going to survive.'\" \n \n Harper-Mercer then told the student that inside the shooter's backpack was \"all the information that you'll need, give it to the police,\" Scroggins said, citing the account by his daughter. \n \n Scroggins also said his daughter heard the gunman tell one victim he would spare that person's life if the student begged, then shot the begging victim anyway. \n \n Lacey Scroggins also spoke about students being ordered to crawl to the middle of the room before being shot. Scroggins said his daughter survived because she was lying on the floor and partially covered by the body and blood of a fellow student. The gunman thought Lacey Scroggins was dead as well, stepped over her and shot someone else. \n \n Randy Scroggins received a phone call from that student's mother while speaking with The Associated Press. \n \n \"He saved my girl. I will forever call your son my hero,\" he said of 20-year-old Treven Anspach. He told the man's mother he would mention her son during his Sunday church service and ask for prayers. \"I'm so sorry for your loss.\" \n \n Janet Willis said her granddaughter Anastasia Boylan was wounded in the Thursday attack and pretended to be dead as Harper-Mercer kept firing, killing eight students and a teacher. \n \n Willis said she visited her 18-year-old granddaughter in a hospital in Eugene, where the sobbing Boylan told her: \"'Grandma, he killed my teacher!'\" \n \n Boylan also said the shooter told one student in the writing class to stand in a corner, handed him a package and told him to deliver it to authorities, Willis said. \n \n The law enforcement official who disclosed the existence of the manifesto did not reveal its contents but described it as an effort to leave a message for law enforcement. \n \n The official is familiar with the investigation but was not authorized to disclose information and spoke on the condition of anonymity. \n \n The official said the document was left at the scene of the shooting but wouldn't specify how authorities obtained it. \n \n Boylan, a freshman at Umpqua Community College, also told her grandmother the gunman asked students about their faith. \n \n \"If they said they were Christian, he shot them in the head,\" Willis said, citing the account given by her granddaughter. \n \n However, conflicting reports emerged about Harper-Mercer's words as he shot his victims. \n \n Stephanie Salas, the mother of Rand McGowan, another student who survived, said she was told by her son that the shooter asked victims whether they were religious but did not specifically target Christians. \n \n Salas said it was like telling the victims \"you're going to be meeting your maker.\" \n \n Salas said the gunman told victims \"'this won't hurt very long'\" before shooting them. \n \n Law enforcement officials have not given details about what happened in the classroom. However they released a timeline that shows police arrived at the scene six minutes after the first 911 call and exchanged gunfire with the shooter two minutes later. \n \n Harper-Mercer was enrolled in the class, but officials have not disclosed a possible motive for the killings. In a statement released by authorities, his family said they were \"shocked and deeply saddened\" by the slayings. \n \n The dead ranged in age from 18 to 67 in the attack in Roseburg, a rural timber town about 180 miles south of Portland. \n \n Harper-Mercer wore a flak jacket and brought at least six guns and five ammunition magazines when he went to the campus that morning. \n \n Oregon's top federal prosecutor said the shooter used a handgun when he opened fire. \n \n Several years ago, Harper-Mercer moved to Oregon from Torrance, California, with his mother Laurel Harper. \n \n Harper-Mercer's social media profiles suggested he was fascinated by the Irish Republican Army and frustrated by traditional organized religion. \n \n Scroggins said he was grateful his daughter survived Harper-Mercer's attack. \n \n \"There's been a lot of emotion,\" he said. \"But others don't get their children back.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Contributing to this report are Associated Press writers Jonathan J. Cooper and Rachel La Corte in Portland; and Rebecca Boone in Boise, Idaho. ||||| Despite Mr. Harper-Mercer\u2019s online interest in high-profile shootings and neighbors\u2019 memories of him as an enthusiastic gun collector who frequently went target shooting with his mother, the gunman\u2019s father told CNN he did not know his son owned guns. \n \n Mr. Harper-Mercer\u2019s parents divorced a decade ago, and he had lived with his mother. The father said he had not seen his son since he and his mother, Laurel Harper, moved to Oregon about two years ago, but said there was no \u201cdisharmony or any bitterness\u201d between him and his son. \n \n Adding a raw, personal voice to the debate over gun control in the wake of this latest mass shooting, he said the United States needed to tighten gun laws. \n \n \u201cIt has to change,\u201d he said. \u201cHow can it not? Even people that believe in the right to bear arms, what right do you have to take someone\u2019s life?\u201d He would not discuss his son\u2019s mental health issues, deferring to the police investigation. \u201cObviously, someone who goes and kills nine people has to have some kind of issue,\u201d he said. \n \n Standing on his lawn, Mr. Mercer said the shooting had devastated his family. \u201cBut we\u2019re not alone in this,\u201d he said. \u201cMy heart goes out to all the families that were affected by this.\u201d \n \n His interview came on the same afternoon that relatives of one of the students wounded in his son\u2019s rampage also stepped in front of the microphones, here outside the front doors of Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg. \n \n Image Christopher Harper-Mercer Credit Associated Press. \n \n Bonnie Schaan, the mother of Cheyeanne Fitzgerald, said that her daughter had been shot in the back during the massacre in her classroom. Tears welled up in her eyes as she explained that a bullet had clipped her daughter\u2019s lung and lodged in one of her kidneys, which had to be removed. Cheyeanne, 16, a nursing student, remains in intensive care. \n \n Mr. Harper-Mercer asked the young woman about her religion, according to her aunt, Colleen Fitzgerald, but \u201cshe didn\u2019t answer.\u201d Instead, Cheyeanne played dead next to her friend, Anastasia Boylan, a student who was also shot. Ms. Schaan said that her daughter did not know Mr. Harper-Mercer. After hearing the news about the shooting on campus, Ms. Schaan said she texted her daughter and said, \u201cI\u2019m on my way to school.\u201d Instead she went to the hospital. \n \n Cheyeanne has begun to talk with her father about the ordeal, Ms. Schaan said. Now, even a chair being moved unsettles her. Her mother added, \u201cShe\u2019s mentioned all the blood.\u201d \n \n Dr. Jason Gray, the chief medical officer at Mercy Medical Center, said only two victims were still in the hospital. One was in critical condition and the other in fair condition. They were expected to be released in two to five days. \n \n The hospital treated seven victims in total, Dr. Gray said. Two were released Thursday, four went into surgery and one died in the emergency department. Three other people were being treated for wounds at PeaceHealth Sacred Heart Medical Center at RiverBend in the town of Springfield. \n \n On Friday, about 300 people showed up at Mercy Medical Center to donate blood, Dr. Gray said. The hospital set up a donation station nearby to handle the crowd. ||||| \n \n \n \n The family of Oregon community college shooter Christopher Sean Harper-Mercer released a statement Saturday, saying they are \u201cshocked and deeply saddened by the horrific events,\u201d which resulted in 10 deaths, including that of their son. \n \n \u201cOur thoughts, our hearts and our prayers go out to all of the families of those who died and were injured,\u201d the statement read, according to multiple news outlets. \n \n Authorities say police officers arrived on the scene six minutes after receiving the first 911 call about the shooting, the Associated Press reports, and officers exchanged gunfire with the shooter two minutes later.

In the wake of that report, several women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct. \n \n Trump said her husband was \"egged on\" in the 2005 tape in which he made lewd comments about his own sexually aggressive behavior toward women -- remarks she says were \"boy talk.\" \n \n \"I said to my husband that, you know, the language was inappropriate. It's not acceptable. And I was surprised, because that is not the man that I know,\" she said. \n \n \"And as you can see from the tape, the cameras were not on -- it was only a mic.

And they know he's married,\" she said. \n \n \"You've seen that?\" Cooper asked. \n \n \"Oh yes, of course. It was in front of me,\" Trump said. \"In front of me. And I've said, like, 'Why did you give your number to my husband?' \" \n \n Melania Trump reserved her strongest critique for the political press, which she says has yet to report an accurate story about her. \n \n \"I didn't expect media would be so dishonest and so mean. I didn't expect that,\" she said. \"Also for me, from the beginning, I never had one correct story -- one honest story.\" \n \n She backed her husband's claims that the election is being rigged in Hillary Clinton's favor, arguing that media bias is undercutting her husband. \n \n \"Well I see it how the media is portraying -- I see how they report things, and what they want to say and what they don't want to say,\" she said. \n \n \"They're going -- just for example, he makes a speech 45 minutes long, they take a sentence out, and they're going on and on about that sentence, nothing else,\" she said. \"And he talks about the issues, and that's what American people want to hear, it's about issues, about jobs, about the future of our country, and that's what he wants to do. \n \n She added: \"He wants to secure the borders, he wants to secure America, he wants to bring jobs back, he wants to bring economy back, and he's very passionate about American people, because he knows he can do that. He's a worker, he's a fighter, he is, he's very passionate about it, and he will not give up, he will fight till the end, and he will fight for American people as he's fighting now for himself.\" \n \n Melania Trump also made clear she doesn't want sympathy. \n \n \"I'm very strong.

    "document": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump added his former White House aide, Omarosa Manigault Newman, on Tuesday to the growing list of African-Americans he has publicly denigrated on Twitter, calling her \u201cthat dog\u201d and a \u201ccrazed, crying lowlife\u201d after her allegations against him of mental deterioration and racism. \n \n Even for a president who consistently uses Twitter to assail his adversaries, the morning tweet about Ms. Manigault Newman was a remarkably crude use of the presidential bully pulpit to disparage a woman who once served at the highest levels in his White House. \n \n In an interview on MSNBC, Ms. Manigault Newman responded that Mr. Trump treats women differently from men because he \u201cbelieves they are beneath him\u201d and that he talked in derogatory ways about minorities. \n \n \u201cHe has absolutely no respect for women, for African-Americans,\u201d she said. \n \n In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has called Don Lemon, a CNN anchor, \u201cthe dumbest man on television.\u201d He has questioned the intelligence of LeBron James, a star basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers. And he has repeatedly said that Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, has a \u201clow I.Q.\u201d ||||| White House: we cannot guarantee there's no tape of Trump using N-word \n \n As the remarkable public spat between Donald Trump and former adviser Omarosa Manigault Newman continued on Tuesday, the White House was unable to guarantee that no recordings exist of the president using the \u201cN-word\u201d. \n \n \n \n Omarosa says Trump is a racist who uses N-word \u2013 and claims there is tape to prove it Read more \n \n At a White House briefing, press secretary Sarah Sanders was asked if she could say no such recordings would emerge. \n \n \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee anything,\u201d she said. \n \n Sanders cited the president\u2019s tweets on the matter and said: \u201cI can tell you that the president addressed this question directly.\u201d On Monday, Trump wrote: \u201cI don\u2019t have that word in my vocabulary and never have.\u201d \n \n On Tuesday morning, he added to earlier tweets when he wrote: \u201cWhen you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn\u2019t work out. Good work by General [John] Kelly for quickly firing that dog!\u201d \n \n Manigault Newman, a former contestant on the reality TV show The Apprentice, is promoting a memoir, Unhinged. She has released two secret recordings related to her firing from the White House late last year and another related to the claims that Trump used the \u201cN-word\u201d during his career in reality TV. \n \n Sanders said she had never heard Trump use the racial epithet in question. \n \n In an interview on MSNBC on Tuesday afternoon, Manigault Newman introduced another angle to the row when she confirmed earlier hints that she has been interviewed by special counsel Robert Mueller. The former FBI director is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election and links between Trump aides and Moscow. \n \n \u201cI have\u201d been interviewed, Manigault Newman said, though she said her \u201chands are tied\u201d over any discussion of what she was asked. \n \n Earlier in the day, the Trump campaign accused her of breaching a 2016 non-disclosure agreement. \n \n In a statement to CNN, the campaign said it had \u201cfiled an arbitration against Omarosa Manigault Newman, with the American Arbitration Association in New York City, for breach of her 2016 confidentiality agreement with the Trump campaign\u201d. It is the first legal action the campaign has launched since Manigault Newman revealed details in her tell-all book about her time as a Trump campaign adviser and senior White House aide. \n \n On MSNBC, Manigault Newman said: \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I have violated [an NDA], but I\u2019m going to leave that to the lawyers to sort that out. It\u2019s interesting that he\u2019s trying to silence me. So what is he trying to hide? What is he afraid of? If he hadn\u2019t said anything that was derogatory or demeaning to African Americans and women, why would he go to this extent to try to shut me down?\u201d \n \n I think he should be afraid of being exposed as the misogynist, the bigot and the racist that he is Omarosa Manigault Newman \n \n Asked if there were any more tapes the president should be \u201cafraid of\u201d, she said: \u201cI think he should be afraid of being exposed as the misogynist, the bigot and the racist that he is.\u201d \n \n Of Trump calling her a \u201cdog\u201d, she said: \u201cI think that it just shows you that if he would say that publicly, what else would he say about me privately? He has absolutely no respect for women, for African Americans \u2013 as evidenced by him instructing the chief of staff to lock me for two hours in the Situation Room to harass me, to threaten me. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s unfit to be in this office and to serve as the president of the United States.\u201d \n \n At the White House briefing, Sanders said Manigault Newman was a \u201cself-serving someone who blatantly cares about herself more than our country\u201d. \n \n Sanders also insisted that Trump\u2019s decision to call Manigault Newman a dog and his other criticisms of prominent African Americans were not racially motivated. \n \n \u201cThis has absolutely nothing to do with race,\u201d she said, \u201cand everything to do with the president calling out someone\u2019s lack of integrity.\u201d \n \n She also complained about reporters only asking about \u201ca few of the things that the president has said negative about people who are minorities\u201d and said Trump was \u201can equal opportunity person who calls it like he sees it and always fights fire with fire\u201d. \n \n Play Video 0:40 Former Trump aide claims to have heard recording of him using N-word \u2013 video \n \n Manigault Newman\u2019s recent TV appearances, and her claim to have heard a tape of Trump using the N-word and other racial slurs during filming for The Apprentice, have clearly infuriated the president. \n \n Did Omarosa break the law by secretly recording Trump and Kelly? Read more \n \n On CBS, Manigault Newman revealed a third tape she said recorded a 2016 conference call among Trump aides discussing how to address potential fallout from any release of tapes that allegedly contain Trump using the N-word. The campaign aides had previously denied any such conversations took place. \n \n In the recording, then campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson can be heard saying: \u201cI am trying to find at least what context it was used in to help us maybe try to figure out a way to spin it.\u201d Later in the conversation, she says: \u201cHe said it. He is embarrassed.\u201d \n \n On Monday night, Pierson said on Fox News the call \u201cdid not happen\u201d. But in a statement on Tuesday, she said she had been seeking \u201cto placate Omarosa to move the discussion along\u201d. \n \n Manigault Newman\u2019s decision to record conversations has attracted controversy. When Kelly fired her in December in the White House Situation Room, she secretly taped the conversation: an apparent breach of security protocol. ||||| President Trump says former White House staffer Omarosa Manigault-Newman lied when she called him a racist who has said the N-word on tape. The president tweeted Monday night, \"I don't have that word in my vocabulary and never have. She made it up.\" But a new recording, obtained by CBS News overnight, seems to back up Omarosa's story that several Trump advisers discussed an alleged tape during the 2016 campaign. \n \n Trump campaign advisers denied on Monday that any conversations took place. CBS News has not been able to verify the authenticity of the recording - though it appears to confirm Omarosa's claims that Trump campaign officials were aware of a tape in which then-candidate Trump uses a racial slur, and they talked about how to handle it. \n \n During her whirlwind book tour, former White House aide Omarosa claimed to have heard tape of President Trump using the N-word during his time on \"The Apprentice.\" \n \n In her new book, \"Unhinged,\" Omarosa claims the Trump campaign was aware of the existence of the tape. She describes an October 2016 phone conversation with Lynne Patton, then-assistant to Eric Trump, spokesperson Katrina Pierson and campaign communications director Jason Miller in which they discuss how to deal with the potential fallout from its release. \n \n Omarosa on Trump tapes: \"If you see it in quotes it can be verified\" \n \n \"I am trying to find at least what context it was used in to help us maybe try to figure out a way to spin it,\" Pierson is heard saying. \n \n Patton then described a conversation she had with then-candidate Trump about making the slur. \n \n Patton: \"I said, 'Well, sir, can you think of anytime where this happened?' And he said, 'no.'\" \n \n Omarosa: \"Well, that is not true.\" \n \n Patton: \"He goes, how do you think I should handle it and I told him exactly what you just said, Omarosa, which is well, it depends on what scenario you are talking about. And he said, well, why don't you just go ahead and put it to bed.\" \n \n Pierson: \"He said. No, he said it. He is embarrassed by it.\" \n \n Appearing on Fox News Monday night before the release of the audio, Pierson denied the call ever took place saying, \"No, Ed (Henry). That did not happen. Sounds like she is writing a script for a movie.\" \n \n The White House and Trump campaign have not provided responses to this new development but Patton and Pierson issued a joint statement Tuesday morning saying, \"No one ever denied the existence of conversations about a reported 'Apprentice' tape. Of course there were multiple discussions about it.\"",

As the forecast coordinator that day for the Slidell, Louisiana, office\u2014which has responsibility for New Orleans\u2014he needed to find a way to convey the urgency and seriousness of the situation his region would face the next day as Hurricane Katrina made landfall. \n \n This is what he came up with: \n \n National Weather Service \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n These bold words, considered by many to be the most dire\u2014and effective\u2014weather forecast ever issued by the National Weather Service, are now in the Smithsonian Museum of American History, along with a rosary from Ricks\u2019 grandmother he held as he and his fellow forecasters rode out the storm. \n \n At a conference of broadcast meteorologists earlier this year, Ricks said, \u201cOn that particular fateful day, when I issued that product \u2026 I was awestruck.\u201d \n \n Another, less widely circulated official forecast he issued that day, the Area Forecast Discussion, was more to the point: \u201cGodspeed to all those in the path of this storm.\u201d \n \n Bold statements like Ricks\u2019 have been occasionally used\u2014and officially encouraged\u2014in recent years by the National Weather Service, as part of an effort to increase the effectiveness of sometimes bland government bulletins during true weather emergencies. Most notably, meteorologist Gary Szatkowski\u2019s \u201cpersonal plea\u201d during Hurricane Sandy\u2019s New York City-area landfall in 2012\u2014which included gut-wrenching statements like \u201cif you are still reluctant (to evacuate), think about your loved ones\u201d\u2014earned him hero status. ||||| NEW ORLEANS \u2014 On Aug. 28, the storm was still a day away. Evacuations were under way and people were just starting to arrive at the Superdome. \n \n At his desk at the National Weather Service office in Slidell, outside New Orleans, meteorologist Robert Ricks knew he had a job to do. He knew he probably had one remaining chance. And so, using computers, history and his fellow forecasters, he sat down to write. \n \n \"I happened to be on the shift,\" Ricks says. \"I happened to pull the trigger. It just happened to be me that day. \n \n Over the newswires \u2014 at NBC News headquarters in New York and across the country \u2014 came a document, titled: \"URGENT... SPECIAL MESSAGE.\" It was an extraordinary bulletin. It warned of a most powerful hurricane with unprecedented strength. It predicted: \"MOST OF THE AREA WILL BE UNINHABITABLE FOR WEEKS. PERHAPS LONGER. AT LEAST ONE HALF OF WELL-CONSTRUCTED HOMES WILL HAVE ROOF AND WALL FAILURE. ALL GABLED ROOFS WILL FAIL. THE VAST MAJORITY OF NATIVE TREES WILL BE SNAPPED OR UPROOTED. OTHERS WILL BE TOTALLY DEFOLIATED.\" \n \n Perhaps most remarkably, Ricks' document predicted: \"WATER SHORTAGES WILL MAKE HUMAN SUFFERING INCREDIBLE BY MODERN STANDARDS.\" \n \n That was the day before the storm. The images of devastation make it clear what happened. \n \n Brian Williams: Did a part of you want to be wrong? \n \n Robert Ricks: I would much rather have been wrong in this one. I would much rather be talking to you and taking the heat and crying wolf. But our local expertise said otherwise. You know, \"Hey, let's gear up for the big one, this is going to be the big one.\" \n \n Williams: How much of you is in that statement? What of you is in that wording? \n \n Ricks: I also had to validate each one of those statements and I was, in my mind, I was saying, \"I'm not going to take this out, it sounds valid. I'm not going to take this part out, it sounds valid. \n \n Williams: So you went through point by point? \n \n Ricks: Yeah, I read each one. I was trying to find things to actually take out. And I said, \"I cannot find it in myself to take these out, because they seem very valid for the situation.\" And I came from the experience of going through Betsy and Camille myself in the Lower Ninth Ward. \n \n But his document was right. And now this lifelong resident of New Orleans, who grew up in the hard-hit Lower Ninth Ward section of the city, is back at work alongside co-workers who have no homes and are wearing the clothes they wore that day. \n \n Williams: If you knew the damage was going to be like this, you did everything in your power to tell people a monster was coming, did the response break your heart? \n \n Ricks: Yes, it did. Because we always prepare for the big one; we just didn't think it was going to come this soon.",

That would be Aug. 28, 2005, one day before Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans. National Weather Service meteorologist Robert Ricks issued a forecast so dire that some news agencies thought it was a hoax, writes meteorologist James Spann in a tweet commemorating the Ricks forecast. As it turns out, Ricks was spot on. \"Most of the area will be uninhabitable for weeks\u2026perhaps longer,\" he wrote. \"At least one half of well constructed homes will have roof and wall failure.

    "document": "(CNN) -- If Marco Lavoie had not been rescued when he was, the Quebec man probably would have perished within 48 hours. \n \n He was hypothermic, dehydrated and near starvation in the unforgiving cold of northwestern Quebec when police rescued him Wednesday. \n \n Lavoie's survival might be called miraculous, as he had been in the wilderness for more than three months. \n \n The 44-year-old is an experienced outdoorsman, but an encounter with a bear changed his luck, Quebec police said \n \n At some point during a planned two-month canoe trek in the Lake Matagami area, a bear attacked Lavoie's campsite, eating his food and ruining his equipment, police spokeswoman Christine Coulombe said. \n \n The bear did not injure Lavoie but left him without the tools or resources to survive. Police say they have yet to speak with Lavoie to get details. \n \n Minnesota hiker falls from cliff to his death near Yosemite waterfall \n \n \"In these parts, there's a subculture of people who go on these long trips into the middle of nowhere, but sometimes we forgot how dangerous it can be,\" Gerald Lemoine, mayor of a small town near Matagami, told the Montreal Gazette. \n \n The rescued canoeist began his adventure July 16, Coulombe said. It wasn't until three months later, on October 21, that his family called authorities because too long had passed without Lavoie's return. \n \n Police conducted searches for eight days, weather permitting, with no luck. \n \n Rescuers in a helicopter finally spotted Lavoie on Wednesday, but they could not safely land at that spot, Coulombe said. So officers had to hike in to pick him up and carry him more than a mile to the chopper. \n \n Lavoie's condition was such that he was barely able to speak and at first couldn't even drink water, the Gazette reported. \n \n Had he spent another day or two in the elements, he would have starved to death, police spokesman Ronald McInnis said. \n \n The man had lost half of his body weight, he said. \n \n It was Lavoie's German shepherd who scared the bear away on the day of the attack, but the dog did not survive the ordeal, McInnis said. \n \n \"Up there, in the Canadian shield, there's little plant life to live off, so he would have been slowly, painfully dying when they found him. It's an amazing feat that he was able to keep himself alive this long with almost no equipment,\" survival instructor Caleb Musgrave told the Gazette. \n \n \"When you start to go hungry, you get mood swings, your mind breaks, and you cramp up all over your body. Eventually, your body will start cannibalizing itself, eating away at the fat in your organs and then in your muscles. It takes someone who won't give up in the face of that,\" he added. \n \n Woman carries stranded, wounded pit bill down mountain ||||| MONTREAL \u2014 Outdoorsman Marco Lavoie, rescued Wednesday after three months in the deep woods near James Bay, made the heartbreaking decision to kill and eat his beloved German shepherd to stay alive. \n \n A source close to the amazing story told QMI Agency that Lavoie, 44, sacrificed his dog when he became stranded at the Nottaway River, roughly 800 km northwest of Montreal. \n \n A bear had eaten Lavoie's food and destroyed his boat in mid-July, leaving him alone with the dog. \n \n A few days after the bear attack, the person who spoke to QMI on condition of anonymity said Lavoie used a rock to kill his dog before eating the pet. \n \n By the time provincial police airlifted him out three months later, Lavoie was barely able to speak or eat. He suffered hypothermia and dehydration and had lost about 90 pounds. \n \n Survival expert Andre Francois Bourbeau said Lavoie did what he could to live. \n \n \"He survived because he made \u008bgood decisions. Eating his dog was one of them,\" said Bourbeau, author of a survival guide. \n \n Bourbeau has researched hundreds of similar stories, some of which include cannibalism. \n \n \"You have to be desperate, but there's no shame in (eating the dog),\" said Bourbeau. \"He had to use reason.\" \n \n The survival expert says that after 30 days in the wilderness with no food, Lavoie's body would have gone into shock from starvation. \n \n \"Hunger squeezes you so much that you would accept food that's not normally possible,\" said Bourbeau. \"You can crave slugs and bugs.\" \n \n Lavoie is an experienced hiker who often spent weeks in the wilderness by himself. But the Nottaway River is considered too dangerous even for the hardiest outdoorsmen. \n \n Andre Diamond, a Waswanipi Cree who lives on an island at the mouth of the river, said he warned Lavoie to stay away. \n \n \"He said it didn't scare him, but it's not a river to travel alone,\" said Diamond. \"Other adventurers have gone there over 20, 30 years and never came back.\" \n \n Sydney Ottereyes, a local Cree who was part of the Lavoie search party, said the river is downright dangerous. \n \n \"It's a complicated river with lots of rocks,\" said Ottereyes. \"In some places, there's plenty of water while elsewhere there's none. The wind comes and there can be up to three currents in the same place.\" \n \n Lavoie is currently hospitalized in \"very serious\" condition. ||||| A hiker was rescued after surviving a bear attack and spending three months, exposed to snow and freezing temperatures, in a remote corner of northern Canada, police said. \n \n Police located Marco Lavoie, 44, in the wilderness near Waskaganish, Quebec, on Wednesday, 10 days after his family reported him missing and nearly a month after the experienced outdoorsman was expected to return from a two month hiking expedition. \n \n Police believe Lavoie survived the bear attack uninjured, sometime in August, when his German shepherd got in between the man and the bear, Sgt. Ronald McInnis, spokesman for the Quebec Provincial Police told ABCNews.com. \n \n \"The bear ate the man's food and damaged his survival equipment,\" said McInnis, \"But his dog went between the man and the bear and protected him. The man was not injured in the attack.\" \n \n McInnis would not say what became of the dog and would not comment on reports that Lavoie may have eaten the dog to survive. \n \n Lavoie suffered \"hypothermia, dehydration and starvation,\" police said, but he is expected to survive his injuries. \n \n The hunt for Lavoie was initially hampered by heavy snow and high winds that grounded helicopters on Oct. 21, but on Oct. 30 a chopper crew spotted Lavoie and officers were dropped in the area that was described by McInnis as \"wild.\" \n \n Lavoie was too weak to walk, and a QPP officer carried the man on his back for nearly two miles to the helicopter, a trip that due to snow and rugged terrain took three hours, McInnis said. \n \n Cops believed the man would have been dead within hours had he not been rescued. He was too weak to eat or drink water and is receiving fluids via IV. \n \n Police are waiting for the man to further recover in order to continue their interview and learn exactly why he was unable to escape the wilderness and the measures he took to survive. ||||| \n \n The Canadian Press \n \n \n \n \n \n MONTREAL -- A man has been rescued after spending three months in a remote forest during which he survived a bear attack, and wound up emaciated and clinging to life. \n \n Police are sharing the improbable story of 44-year-old Marco Lavoie, an experienced hiker who set off on what was supposed to be a two-month excursion on July 16, 2013. \n \n Police can't say exactly when that bear attack occurred. But it's believed that in mid-August, halfway through his planned trip, the animal attacked his encampment, ate his food, and destroyed his survival gear. \n \n Given all his experience in the deep woods, his loved ones simply assumed when he didn't turn up last month that he'd extended his stay in the Lake Matagami region of northwestern Quebec. \n \n But they became increasingly alarmed in recent weeks and called the provincial police on Oct. 21. Police sent out a helicopter to rescue him. \n \n The helicopter couldn't land. So two police officers dropped down, and one carried Lavoie back up on his shoulders. They brought him to hospital. \n \n Police say he was rescued just in time. \n \n \"We believe he might have died in a few more hours -- 24 to 48 hours more,\" said Sgt. Ronald McInnis, a provincial police spokesman. \n \n \"He's in critical condition. He wasn't even able to drink water when we offered him some. He will be on an IV for several weeks. \n \n \"He will gradually learn to drink, and then eat, again.\" \n \n The man had lost much of his body weight and was suffering from hypothermia when he was found: \"It's already been snowing (up there) for two or three weeks. The nights are cold,\" McInnis said.",

Marco Lavoie set off on July 16 for what he intended to be a two-month spell in the woods, reports the Canadian Press. The timeline of what happened between that date and Oct. 30 is somewhat mushy: About a month after his departure, a bear attacked his campsite, leaving him without food or gear. Sgt. Ronald McInnis tells ABC News, \"His dog went between the man and the bear and protected him.\" Unconfirmed reports say Lavoie was later forced to eat the German shepherd; McInnis wouldn't comment on that detail other than to say the dog did not survive, reports CNN. But the details that have been confirmed are pretty jarring: Lavoie lost nearly half his body weight and had begun to suffer from hypothermia, having weathered snow and temps below freezing. He was essentially unable to eat, drink, or speak when he was found, having been spotted by helicopter along the Nottaway River on Wednesday, nine days after a missing persons report was filed (as an experienced outdoorsman, Lavoie's family wasn't initially concerned when he didn't return as scheduled). Lavoie is expected to recover after what will likely be weeks spent on an IV, and police are waiting to talk to him about his experience.

    "document": "Thomas Trutschel/Photothek/Getty \n \n Some people put the cut-off at 1984, but for most it is 1980. People born after that date are the digital natives; those born before are digital immigrants, doomed to be forever strangers in a computer-based strange land. \n \n The generational difference between the groups goes beyond their numbers of Facebook friends and Twitter followers: it can also help to explain differences in how they buy insurance. At least, that\u2019s according to a report released this week for the insurance industry. Targeting Millennials with Insurance explains that young people aren\u2019t like those who came before and queued passively for cover. They \u201cprioritize holidays\u201d, for one, which might surprise some of them. Because they are digital natives, they \u201cwill favor technologically innovative insurance policies\u201d. \n \n But a paper published last month in Teaching and Teacher Education reaches the opposite conclusion. The digital native is a myth, it claims: a yeti with a smartphone (P. A. Kirschner and P. D. Bruyckere Teach. Teach. Educ. 67, 135\u2013142; 2017). The implications go beyond insurance. Many schools and universities are retooling to cope with kids and young adults who are supposedly different. From collaborative learning in the classroom to the provision of e-learning modules in undergraduate courses, the rise of the digital native is being used as a reason \u2014 some say a justification \u2014 for significant policy changes. \n \n Education policy is particularly vulnerable to political whims, fads and untested assumptions. From swapping evolution for creationism to the idea that multiple types of intelligence demand multiple approaches, generations of children are schooled according to dogma, not evidence. Surveys show, for example, that teachers and education experts subscribe to dozens of different and opposing \u2018learning styles\u2019. Under these, children can be categorized as activists or theorists, organizers or innovators, non-committers or plungers, globalists or analysts, deep or surface learners, and so on. Could the latest example be altering access to, and the provision of, technology in the classroom, simply because a new cohort is believed to be more familiar with it? \n \n It is beyond dispute that people brought up in the most recent decades have been exposed to a lot of digital technology \u2014 at least in developed countries. And paper co-author Paul Kirschner, an education researcher at the Open University of the Netherlands in Heerlen, happily describes himself in his academic work as a \u201cwindmill-fighter\u201d. But whereas Don Quixote aimed against solid walls, the digital-native assumption, on closer inspection, does seem illusory. It is certainly no giant. \n \n A 2011 review for the Higher Education Academy in York, UK, put it bluntly, as the first of its executive-summary conclusions: \u201cThere is no evidence that there is a single new generation of young students entering Higher Education and the terms Net Generation and Digital Native do not capture the processes of change that are taking place\u201d. Many members of the digital-savvy generation use technology in the same way as many of their elders: to passively soak up information. Children say they prefer IT in their lessons and courses? Do schools listen when kids say they prefer chips for lunch every day? \n \n The Teaching and Teacher Education paper raises another concern. Digital natives are assumed to be able to multitask, it warns. But the evidence for this is also scant. Reading text messages during university lectures almost certainly comes at a cognitive cost. So too, employers might assume, does fiddling with smartphones and laptops in meetings. Buy that technologically innovative insurance policy another time. ||||| Marketers and social theorists love to talk about digital natives. This group is supposedly a generation of early adopters under the age of about 35, uniquely adept at technology compared to their older counterparts. But according to a recent editorial in Nature, these digital natives are a figment of our collective imagination\u2014about as easy to find as a \u201ca yeti with a smartphone.\u201c \n \n The editorial points to a review paper published this June in the journal Teaching and Teacher Education, which concluded that \u201cinformation-savvy digital natives do not exist.\u201d Despite assertions that younger generations learn differently and require specialized, multimedia teaching strategies because they grew up with smartphones and the web, the authors say that there is no evidence to suggest that digital natives are more tech-savvy or good at multi-tasking than older generations. \n \n This idea of the digital native was born out of the a 2001 essay by educator Marc Prensky, who claimed that a new generation was especially skilled at processing multiple streams of information and using technology, reports Discover Magazine. Prensky argued the world should adapt its teaching methods accordingly. But Paul Kirschner, co-author of the Teaching and Teacher Education study and a professor of educational psychology at the Open University in the Netherlands, argues that we hurt, rather than help, students learn when we assume that they have unique technological skills. \u201dWe have to treat people as human, cognitive learners and stop considering one specific group to have special powers,\u201d Kirschner tells Discover. \n \n This idea is backed up by other research showing that millennials do not necessarily possess special skills at basic computer programs compared to older generations. Research has also shown that multitasking is neither a special domain of the young nor an effective way to get good results for virtually anyone. \n \n If the idea of \u201cdigital natives\u201d was just jargon that advertisers used to sell to the under-30 crowd, all this might not matter much. But the idea that digital native are fundamentally different is influencing everything from the way curriculums are designed to the way companies shape their corporate work environments. \n \n A better approach might be to rethink how we define generations. Digital natives have not developed unique intellectual abilities from their proximity to technology because basic human cognition doesn\u2019t change from generation to generation. But Jean Twenge, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University, argues that categorizing people into distinct generations can be useful for certain things. She points out that millennials show significant differences from older peers in terms of their workplace preferences, life goals, religious participation, alcohol and drug use, and trust in institutions. In other words, generations may have different habits and world views\u2014but the way people learn won\u2019t change so quickly. ||||| Digital Natives \n \n Marc coined the terms \u201cDigital Natives\u201d and \u201cDigital Immigrants\u201d in an essay in 2001, bringing together under this umbrella concepts that had been floating around the idea world in various guises. (See this updated 2006 blog post by Marc on the origins of the terms.) \n \n The terms \u201cDigital Natives\u201d and \u201cDigital Immigrants\u201d have since circled the globe, being used by Bill Gates and Rupert Murdoch among millions of others. Books have been published by others on the subject (e.g. \u201cDeconstructing Digital Natives\u201d) and Harvard Univerity initiated a \u201cDigital Natives Project\u201d. \n \n The terms also brought their share of controversy, which Marc found surprising\u2014 given that this was, for him, only a metaphor to help people understand why and how things in their world were changing. Marc believes that much of the controversy was due to a mis-interpretation of the term Digital Native by some people to mean that \u201ceveryone born after a certain date knows everything about technology.\u201d That, of course, is patently false. \n \n Today Marc has largely moved on from using this metaphor, and now focuses on all people finding \u201cDigital Wisdom\u201d together. For those who care, Marc\u2019s current view of Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants is this: \n \n The Digital Natives / Digital Immigrants metaphor is NOT about what people know, or can do, with technology. Everyone has to learn in one way or another. It\u2019s more about culture and attitudes. Digital Immigrants lived in two cultures: the pre-digital and the digital. Digital Natives have known only the digital culture. A great many of the Digital Immigrants\u2019 deeply-felt attitudes and preferences were formed in, and reflect, the pre-digital culture and age. The Digital Natives / Digital Immigrants metaphor is basically a shorthand way of expressing that many of the attitudes formed by those who grew up in the old, pre-digital culture clash with those of the Natives, whose attitudes were formed in the new, digital culture \u2014 this is independent of what each may \u201cknow\u201d about how digital technology works. Problems too often stem from people making judgments that reflect their own formative cultures, and thinking of those judgments as culture-independent or absolute. Immigrants have to watch out for thinking the way they learned to do things is still the best way. Natives need to realize that they still have to learn many things about technology \u2014 and life. That is why it is important that we all learn to work together, with mutual respect, to find Digital Wisdom. \n \n (See also Controversy)",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Are you a \"digital native\" or a \"digital immigrant,\" and does it make a difference? Research recently published in the Teaching and Teacher Education journal indicates the concept of so-called digital natives\u2014aka, those slotted into the \"millennials\" category and younger, and often thought to be masters of technology and multitasking\u2014is a myth, reports Discover magazine. Why it's important for this myth to be shattered, scientists say, is because companies and educators have been urged to revamp their processes and environments to cater to the supposedly more tech-savvy younger generation, Quartz notes. \"The answer is not how we can adapt [to the younger generation],\" says lead author Paul Kirschner, an Open University educational psychology professor. \"We have to treat people as human, cognitive learners and stop considering one specific group to have special powers.\" Previous studies have suggested digital immigrants\u2014those born before the early '80s and, as Nature puts it, thought to be \"doomed to be forever strangers in a computer-based strange land\"\u2014can handle technological tasks as well as the younger set. In fact, every generation has trouble multitasking (think emailing and watching TV at the same time) because our brains just aren't equipped to fully concentrate on multiple tasks at once. Even Marc Prensky, the educator who first popularized the terms \"digital native\" and \"digital immigrants\" in a 2001 essay, is now moving away from those labels and embracing the term \"digital wisdom,\" which he says we can all aspire to. \"The Digital Natives/Digital Immigrants metaphor is NOT about what people know, or can do, with technology,\" his site notes. \"It's more about culture and attitudes.\" (Not taking anything away from this 4-year-old, though.)",

The facility says it all happened at its dental clinic from Oct. 2015 to Oct. 2016. The center claims the infection risk is low and is limited to patients of a single care provider, though that provider was not named in a statement from the Tomah VA. The facility investigated the situation. It says that work was finished Oct. 31. It goes on to say that the provider was immediately removed from patient care.

A dentist at the Tomah, Wisconsin VA used his own equipment, cleaning it between patients, Acting Medical Center Director Victoria Brahm said. VA rules require the use of disposable instruments, throwing them out after use. \n \n This practice went on for one year, from October 2015 to October 2016, and now 592 veterans are at risk of having contracted Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or HIV.

    "document": "Phone-Hacking Trial \n \n Rupert Murdoch\u2019s \u2018News of the World\u2019 intercepted Kate Middleton and Prince Harry's voicemails, prosecutors alleged in a London court on Thursday. \n \n Kate Middleton and Prince Harry had their phones hacked by Rupert Murdoch\u2019s biggest selling newspaper, a court in London heard on Thursday. \n \n \n \n It is the first time the Murdoch media empire has been accused of illegally accessing the phone of a member of the royal family: previous allegations have centered on the hacking of phones used by royal aides. The now-shuttered Sunday tabloid, the News of the World, is accused of accessing Middleton\u2019s voicemails to gain embarrassing personal details about her and Prince William. \n \n The court heard that a series of private messages that were intended to be shared only by the two young lovers have recently been unearthed as part of the police investigation. \"Hi, baby. It's me,\" began one of the messages left by her then boyfriend, Prince William, in 2006. In another, he calls her \"babykins\". \n \n In a message that was allegedly left on Harry\u2019s phone, William, the future King of England assumed a falsetto voice and pretended to be his brother\u2019s girlfriend Chelsy Davy. \u201cI really miss you,\u201d he joked. \u201cHopefully I'll see you very soon you big hairy fat ginger.\u201d The jury was told by the prosecution lawyer, Anthony Edis QC, about eight voicemail messages recorded by Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator who has pleaded guilty to a second charge of phone hacking earlier this year. \n \n \n \n The explosive allegations are the latest in a series of damning claims of corrupt and illegal practices that the prosecution says were endemic at the News of the World. \n \n In prosecution evidence in mid-November, the jury at the Old Bailey were shown a note seized from Mulcaire on his arrest in 2006, entitled \u201ctarget evaluation.\u201d Eighteen names were on the list including Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, then private secretary to Prince William and Harry; Helen Asprey, another royal aide; and Mark Dyer, a royal equerry to Charles and his two sons. Recent evidence has alleged the Sunday tabloid targeted Patrick Harverson, Prince Charles\u2019s communications secretary. \n \n Prince Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge are the highest profile alleged victims of phone hacking to emerge during the first two months in the trial of Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson and five others. \n \n In recent weeks the jury at the Old Bailey in Central London has heard allegations that the tentacles of Murdoch\u2019s newspaper reached right inside Buckingham Palace. When the home of Clive Goodman, the former royal correspondent for News of the World, was raided by police in August 2006, police say they discovered 15 royal phone directories, which listed the numbers of the entire royal family, staff and close friends. The jury have since been shown several timelines of admissions or \u2018agreed facts\u2019 between defense and prosecution that show the Sunday tabloid sourced a number of its royal stories from phone hacking. In 2006, the paper accused Prince Harry of cheating in exams at the Sandhurst military academy after a message on his private secretary\u2019s phone was allegedly intercepted. \n \n However, palace officials were not informed of this apparent security lapse about the royal directories until Goodman\u2019s re-arrest in the light of the phone hacking scandal in 2011. The alleged breaches heard in court on Thursday were the most serious yet. \n \n \n \n In a transcript of one of the messages, William was quoted as saying to Middleton: \u201cHi, baby. Um, sorry, I\u2019ve just got back in off my night navigation exercise,\u201d the jury were told. \"I\u2019ve been running around the woods of Aldershot chasing shadows and getting horribly lost, and I walked into some other regiment\u2019s ambush, which was slightly embarrassing because I nearly got shot.\u201d \n \n The jury were then shown emails Clive Goodman sent to his editors at the News of the World explaining how William \"got shot on a night exercise.\" Goodman's Blackadder columns in January 2006 are alleged to have relied on the exclusive revelations that William calls Kate \u201cbabykins\u201d and a description of the military training accident. Prosecutor Andrew Edis alleged that the stories were linked to payments of around $5000 to 'Matey'--an alias for private investigator Mulcaire. \n \n Earlier this month the court heard that Andy Coulson, who replaced Rebekah Brooks as editor of News of the World 2003 was warned by Goodman about the risks they were taking by acquiring the phone directories, let alone using them to hack phones. \u201cThese people will not be paid in anything other than cash because if they're discovered selling stuff to us they end up on criminal charges, as could we,\u201d Goodman allegedly wrote to Coulson, in an email read in court. Coulson, who is alleged to have been conducting an affair with Rebekah Brooks at the time, later became Prime Minister David Cameron\u2019s head of communications at Number Ten Downing Street. \n \n In other evidence the prosecution claims that Rebekah Brooks, during her time as editor of the best-selling British daily paper, the Sun, approved over $60,000 of payments to a former Ministry of Defence employee, Bettina Jordan-Barber, who\u2014the prosecution alleges\u2014was the source of several stories about the royal princes as they attended the military training academy at Sandhurst. ||||| Story highlights Prosecutor reads transcripts of messages between Prince William, Kate Middleton \n \n Evidence is revealed in phone-hacking trial of former News of the World editors \n \n Several hundred attempts made to hack phones of UK princes' aides, court told earlier \n \n The British tabloid News of the World hacked Kate Middleton's phone while she was dating Prince William, a prosecutor told a London court Thursday in a trial of the defunct newspaper's executives, according to the British Press Association. \n \n In one voicemail message that William left Kate -- the transcript of which was read in court by the prosecutor -- the prince calls his future wife \"Babykins\" and says he was almost shot by blank rounds during a military training exercise, the PA reported. \n \n The date of the message wasn't immediately clear, though the couple weren't yet married at the time, the PA reported. Middleton became the Duchess of Cambridge when she married William in April 2011. \n \n The transcript, dug up during a police investigation into the newspaper's alleged hacking practices, was one of several messages between the couple that were read at London's Old Bailey court, the PA reported. \n \n The revelation came at the trial of former News of the World editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson and the paper's former managing editor, Stuart Kuttner. All are accused of conspiring between October 2000 and August 2006 \"to intercept communications in the course of their transmission, without lawful authority.\" They deny the charges. \n \n JUST WATCHED Report: Kate Middleton's phone hacked Replay More Videos ...

    "document": "Oxytocin, a hormone often referred to as the \"cuddle chemical\" for its role in helping to foster intimate relationships\u2014particularly between mothers and their newborns\u2014may help people with autism to read and react to social cues, according to the preliminary results of a small study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders often have trouble engaging and interacting in social situations, frequently avoiding eye contact, for example, and previous research has also shown that people who are autistic often have lower levels of the hormone oxytocin. In this recent study, researchers from France's Center of Cognitive Neuroscience used nasal inhalers to give oxytocin to 13 individuals with high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. Afterwards, the researchers examined the study participants' reactions to social stimuli. They found that, after the oxytocin, the subjects showed significant improvement on social tasks\u2014including making more eye contact when shown pictures of faces, and responding to other players in a ball tossing game. \n \n Oxytocin, sometimes referred to as the \"love hormone\", is one powerful chemical: during physical intimacy, it increases for both men and women; it acts as a hormone to help induce labor and lactation in mothers; and it also serves as a nuerotransmitter in the brain\u2014research suggests that it influences everything from our ability to fall in love, to our tendency toward monogamous relationships and ability to trust others. Should these initial findings be confirmed, they may suggest a potential therapeutic use of oxytocin for individuals with autism spectrum disorders. What's more, it could even increase opportunities for early intervention for children diagnosed with autism. As Angela Sirigu, lead author of the study, told the Washington Post, \"It's possible it can become a cure, if it's given early when the problems are detected in the little kids... We can change the way these patients interact with people from childhood.\" ||||| A nasal spray containing a hormone that is known to make women more maternal and men less shy apparently can help those with autism make eye contact and interact better with others, according to a provocative study released Monday. \n \n The study, involving 13 adults with either a high-functioning form of autism or Asperger syndrome, a mild form of the disorder, found that when the subjects inhaled the hormone oxytocin, they scored significantly better on a test that involved recognizing faces and performed much better in a game that involved tossing a ball with others. \n \n Although more research is needed to confirm and explore the findings, the results are the latest in a growing body of evidence indicating that the hormone could lead to ways to help people with the often devastating brain disorder function better. \n \n \"This is the first study that looked at whether oxytocin has an effect on social behavior, which is a major deficit in autism,\" said Angela Sirigu, who directs the National Center for Scientific Research in France and led the study, published online by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \"It looks like it could be very helpful.\" \n \n Researchers who were not involved in the study praised the work, saying the findings were promising and could lead to the first effective treatment for the central problems affecting people with autism. \n \n \"I think it's going to be a very exciting finding for a lot of people,\" said Alex Martin, chief of cognitive neuropsychology at the National Institute of Mental Health. \n \n Because oxytocin does not last long in the body and produces its effects for a relatively brief period, some experts said the findings were more likely to encourage drug companies to develop alternative substances that had the same benefits. \n \n \"This paper suggests that's worth doing,\" said Thomas R. Insel, director of the institute. \"It adds another brick in the wall that suggests there may be an opportunity to develop treatment for one of the core symptoms of autism. That's been the brass ring.\" \n \n But Sirigu was among those who said the finding should encourage more research on the potential benefits of oxytocin itself, especially for children. Administering the hormone soon after a child's autism is diagnosed might help him or her develop more normally, she said. \n \n \"It's possible it can become a cure, if it's given early when the problems are detected in the little kids,\" Sirigu said. \"We can change the way these patients interact with people from childhood.\" \n \n Because previous research has indicated that some people with autism might have abnormally low levels of oxytocin, conducting tests to identify those people and administering them the hormone might help as well, said Karen Parker, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine. \n \n \"If you can find someone who appears to have deficits in oxytocin biology, giving them what you might argue would be replacement oxytocin may be helpful,\" Parker said. \n \n Autism is a baffling disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including speech and learning problems and profound, disabling difficulties understanding emotions and social cues when interacting with people. The number of children found to have autism has been increasing for reasons that remain mysterious. \n \n Oxytocin is produced naturally in the bodies of humans and animals. It plays a key role in social interaction, promoting maternal behavior and monogamy in animals. The hormone also heightens social sensitivity, social awareness, generosity and trust in people. \n \n Previous U.S. studies found that people with autism who received the hormone intravenously were less likely to engage in repetitive behavior that is another hallmark of autism and were more likely to be able to identify emotions in voices. Another study being published in the journal Biological Psychiatry found that 16 autistic males in Australia ages 12 to 19 who received the hormone through a nasal spray were better able to recognize other people's facial expressions. \n \n \"All the data seem to suggest that manipulating the oxytocin system has a powerful effect on the core symptoms of autism,\" said Eric Hollander, director of the compulsive, impulsive and autism spectrum disorders program at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York. \n \n While cautioning that more research is needed on children and additional patients to make sure oxytocin is safe and effective, advocates for families with children with autism welcomed the findings. Oxytocin has been in use for several years as an \"alternative\" therapy for autism. \n \n \"Many families are using it with success and reporting improvement,\" said Wendy Fournier, president of the National Autism Association. \"Getting double-blind clinical studies like this one published helps to bring credibility to parental reports.\" \n \n \"We need to be mindful of the fact that the majority of human studies of oxytocin have been conducted using adults, including this study, and only one paper has included individuals between the ages of 12 and 18. We have to be careful about the safety and efficacy of oxytocin on pediatric populations,\" said Clara Lajonchere, vice president of clinical programs for Autism Speaks.",

These wines are just the right blend of incredible quality and amazing value that guests can only get at Target.\" ||||| New line of wines made with California-grown grapes. \n \n Determined to make us love it even more, Target just announced an incredible new line of wine. And the best part is that each selection from the collection only costs $5 a bottle. Move over Trader Joe\u2019s; there\u2019s a new wino in town. \n \n As long as you\u2019re not super snobby about the cost of your wine, you\u2019ll likely find and love one of the five new gems from Target. The collection is called California Roots since all the blends are made with premium, California-grown grapes. We don\u2019t if they\u2019re actually premium or what a grape does to earn that title, but Target says they\u2019re A+, and we trust the mother ship. Without further delay, let\u2019s meet your new favorite beverage. \n \n First up is the Chardonnay blend. According to Target, the wine\u2019s profile includes \u201clush tropical fruit flavors and a bright finish,\u201d which sounds perfect for the last days of summer. Our besties (Target employees) recommended pairing this wine with artisanal cheeses and freshly baked bread. When are fancy cheeses not a great idea? \n \n If your diet isn\u2019t just cheese and bread, then the Pinot Grigio is the choice for you and your healthy salad and fresh fish. For real, though, that\u2019s the recommended pairing. We\u2019re sure it goes just as well with popcorn and ice cream straight out of the carton. Don\u2019t judge. Anyway, this Grig\u2019s profile includes \u201cvibrant citrus and tropical fruit flavors.\u201d Another excellent selection. \n \n If you love dessert wines or just any blend that\u2019s a bit sweeter than you\u2019ll want to grab a bottle or two of the new Moscato. \u201cDelicate aromas and creamy peach and melon flavors make every day feel a little more special,\u201d the wine lovers at Target wrote about this blend. They suggested pairing it with \u201csweet, freshly picked berries.\u201d \n \n Don\u2019t worry, lovers of reds \u2014 the mother of commerce and children crying in aisle four didn\u2019t forget about you. \u201cJuicy cherry flavors, hints of oak and graceful finish elevate even the simplest pleasures\u201d in the collection\u2019s Cabernet Sauvignon, according to Target. Like most reds, this one is recommended with a nice steak, a thick rib eye to be specific. \n \n Last but not least in the California Roots line is the Red Blend. Sure, we would have liked to see more red options, but this is Target\u2019s first shot at $5 wine, so we\u2019re willing to overlook it. According to the mega store, this blend is made up of \u201csmooth berry and cherry flavors with hints of spice offer the perfect antidote to the workweek.\u201d The recommended pairing is wild mushroom pasta and grilled vegetables, but it\u2019s sure to complement a pizza as well. \n \n Sadly, some Target locations don\u2019t carry any wine. It\u2019s true. There are poor souls scattered across the country who don\u2019t get to experience the beloved mega store in all its glory. \n \n When Target announces its new wine coming out on Sunday and you live in Indiana pic.twitter.com/VWQsdxR3Gm \u2014 Sam (@sam_taft) August 28, 2017 \n \n For those of you lucky enough to live near a Target that sells booze (me!), pick up a bottle from the California collection starting Sept. 3. ||||| Loving all these incredible new brands debuting at Target?

    "document": "One of the Secret Service supervisors ousted in the agency's ongoing prostitution scandal joked on Facebook that he was checking out former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin as he protected her during the 2008 campaign. \n \n FILE - In this Oct. 28, 2008 file photo, a Secret Service agent stands near then presidential candidate Barack Obama, background, at a rally in Norfolk, Va. Moving swiftly, the Secret Service forced out... (Associated Press) \n \n FILE - In this June 30, 2010 file photo, Senate Judiciary Committee member, Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington. Sessions told reporters Thursday, the president should take... (Associated Press) \n \n David Chaney, one of two supervisors forced out of the agency this week, wrote: \"I was really checking her out, if you know what i (sic) mean?\" after a friend commented on the picture posted in January 2009. \n \n In an interview with Fox News Thursday, Palin said the joke is on Chaney. \n \n \"Well, check this out, buddy _ you're fired!\" Palin said. \n \n Chaney posted at least two pictures of him with Palin, along with another in which a woman in a revealing bikini top stood in the background, looking at Chaney. The photo was captioned: \"not in front of my son.\" \n \n Details of the photos and comments were first reported Thursday by The Washington Post. \n \n Palin said the scandal is \"a symptom of government run amok.\" \n \n \"It's like, who's minding the store around here?\" Palin told Fox. \"The president, for one, he better be wary, there, of when Secret Service is accompanying his family on vacation. They may be checking out the first lady instead of guarding her.\" \n \n Earlier Thursday, he White House had expressed renewed confidence in the director of the Secret Service in the midst of the sordid scandal, which threatens to become a serious political distraction in an election year. A key lawmaker who oversees the Secret Service predicted more firings there soon. \n \n President Barack Obama's chief spokesman, Jay Carney, noted that some Secret Service employees involved have already lost their jobs, just days into the government's formal investigation of the incident last weekend in Colombia, where Obama was to attend a summit meeting. Carney also said the president's security in Cartagena was never compromised, and he asked for patience as official investigations continue. \n \n \"Perhaps it would be in the interests of a complete and thorough and fair investigation not to make determinations about the conclusions of an investigation before they've even been reached,\" Carney said. \"That's the president's position.\" \n \n The scandal arose ahead of the Summit of the Americas when at least some of 11 Secret Service employees brought prostitutes back to their Cartagena hotel. The agency has moved quickly to try to quell the embarrassing episode, forcing out three employees so far, including two supervisors. The supervisors were in the agency's uniformed division; one is a sergeant, according to a person familiar with Secret Service operations who refused to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. \n \n Lawrence Berger, general counsel for the Federal Law Enforcement Officials Association, confirmed Thursday he is representing the supervisors, Chaney and Greg Stokes, but said he could not discuss details of the investigation. \n \n \"I cannot comment because I have an obligation of confidentiality with my clients and I have to maintain that,\" Berger said. \n \n A third employee has resigned. The employees under investigation include members of the agency's \"jump teams,\" which are sent to sites to set up security in advance of the president's arrival. Others are on counter-assault and counter-sniper teams. The majority of the group is believed to be based in the Washington area. \n \n Eight men remain suspended and have had their top-secret security clearances lifted. The scandal also involves about 10 military personnel and as many as 20 Colombian women. \n \n Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican and chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, said Thursday that more firings could be imminent. \n \n \"I wouldn't be surprised if you saw more dismissals and more being forced out sooner rather than later,\" said King, who is being updated on the investigation by Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan. \"You may see a few more today or tomorrow.\" \n \n Sen. Chuck Grassley, the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he thought more people would be fired within \"just a few days.\" \n \n \"`I expect there will be more, but that's what the investigation is all about.\" \n \n Three U.S. military officials have said the military personnel include five Army Green Berets, two Navy Explosive Ordinance Disposal technicians, two Marine dog handlers and an Air Force airman. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still under way. \n \n An Air Force colonel and a military lawyer have gone to Colombia as part of the military investigation. The Secret Service probe has included interviews with the employees and hotel staff. \n \n King said investigators in Colombia have not been able to interview the women. \n \n A 24-year-old prostitute told The New York Times this week that the scandal became public after she fought over payment with one of the Secret Service employees, and it spilled out into the hallway of the Hotel Caribe on April 12. \n \n Jose Pena, a Cartagena taxi driver, told The Associated Press that he picked up the woman after the dispute. She said she left the hotel, where other members of the security detail and the White House press corps were staying, after she was paid $225. \n \n In Cartagena this week, sex workers and hotel staff were reluctant to speak about the incident, which has become an election year embarrassment in the U.S. \n \n Prostitution is legal in Colombia, and Cartagena thrives on the sex tourism industry, Mayor Campo Elias readily acknowledged, with hundreds of prostitutes available on any given night throughout the colonial walled city. \n \n In Washington, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who said she had not been briefed, called the incident \"disgusting.\" \n \n \"There has to be an investigation to see how this could have happened, and those responsible should have to pay a price,\" Pelosi said. \"But as with all these things, there are many people in the Secret Service who do their job responsibly, and we can't paint everyone with the same brush. But nonetheless, those people who were responsible have brought disgrace and it's disgusting.\" \n \n Rep. Randy Forbes, a Virginia Republican, called for leadership changes at the Secret Service. \n \n \"I mentioned before, and I can't get a better analogy than baseball. You get three strikes,\" Forbes said. \"They went over their budgets, they couldn't control their budget. They couldn't control who got in the White House. And now we're talking about just absolutely a fundamental principle of security planning _ you don't let the prostitutes in.\" \n \n Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada suggested the problem lies with the judgment of those involved. \n \n \"Understand this, there is not a committee hearing that's going to take the place or stop people from being stupid. There is not a bill we can pass to cause people to have common sense,\" Reid said. \"Think about this. People that are here to protect the president, they go to Colombia and have a fight with a prostitute over how much she should be paid. That's either very stupid or a total lack of common sense.\" \n \n Another Republican lawmaker said Thursday that the Secret Service incident raised questions about whether Obama was capably leading the government. \n \n \"I don't sense that this president has shown that kind of managerial leadership,\" said Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama. \n \n During his daily briefing, Carney shot back: \"That sounds very much like a lawmaker attempting to politicize something that is not at all political.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Laurie Kellman, Jim Abrams, Julie Pace, Larry Margasak, Ken Thomas and Eileen Sullivan in Washington, Brian Witte in Annapolis, Md., Denise Lavoie in Boston and Frank Bajak in Cartagena, Colombia, contributed to this report. ||||| One of the Secret Service supervisors ousted from the agency this week for their involvement in the Colombia prostitution scandal made light of his official protective work on his Facebook page, joking about a picture of himself standing watch behind Sarah Palin. \n \n David Randall Chaney, 48, posted several shots of himself on duty in a dark suit and sunglasses, including one that shows him behind the 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee during that campaign. \n \n \u201cI was really checking her out, if you know what i mean?\u201d Chaney wrote in the comments section after friends had marveled at the photo. He is married and has an adult son. \n \n Chaney, who had been a supervisor in the Secret Service\u2019s international programs division, retired under pressure Wednesday, according to people familiar with an internal agency investigation into the allegations that 11 agents and uniformed officers participated in a night of carousing April 11 ahead of President Obama\u2019s visit to the Summit of the Americas. \n \n He was one of two senior supervisors who are accused in the scandal, which investigators believe included heavy drinking, visits to a strip club and payments to women working as prostitutes. Several people familiar with the matter have identified the other supervisor as Greg Stokes, who was assistant special agent in charge of the K-9 division. Stokes has been notified by agency officials that he will be fired, although he will be given an opportunity to contest the charges, those with knowledge of the case said. \n \n The disclosure that two high-level managers were involved in the misconduct has raised questions of accountability and personal conduct in an agency whose top leadership has insisted that the Cartagena incident is an isolated and aberrant case, not a sign of a deeper cultural problem within the institution. \n \n Chaney and Stokes have each worked at the Secret Service for nearly two decades, and both have served significant time with the presidential protection detail, people who know the men said. Both are based in Washington. \n \n The supervisors were sent on the trip to supervise dozens of younger, less-experienced agents who were part of the advance team preparing for Obama\u2019s arrival. \n \n Lawrence Berger, the general counsel for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association and an attorney for Chaney and Stokes, declined to comment on details of the allegations involving his clients. He said the agency\u2019s investigation is not complete for either man and stressed that any judgment about their roles in the scandal is \u201cpremature.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s our ultimate position that nothing they may or may not have done in Colombia negatively impacted the efficiency of their mission,\u201d Berger said. \u201cNothing that has been reported to have been done has impacted negatively their mission or the president\u2019s visit.\u201d \n \n Members of Congress who have been briefed on the matter have said 21 men are suspected of bringing as many as 21 prostitutes to their rooms. Ten military personnel also have been accused of participating, along with the 11 Secret Service members. \n \n The incident became public after one man got into a dispute over payment with a woman on the morning of April 12, drawing the attention of hotel staff and Colombian authorities, who reported the matter to the U.S. Embassy. \n \n The Secret Service recalled its 11 employees and replaced them with another team before Obama arrived April 13. All of the recalled members were placed on administrative leave, and their top-secret security clearances were revoked. \n \n The Secret Service announced Wednesday that three of the men were being dismissed from the agency for their involvement. The third man is a junior member of the team who has voluntarily elected to resign, those familiar with the investigation said. \n \n Berger did not answer questions about his clients\u2019 employment status. \n \n \u201cThey have a passion for the agency\u2019s mission,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve both been doing it for over 17 or 18 years, day in and day out, and very well.\u201d \n \n On Thursday, Capitol Hill lawmakers who oversee the Department of Homeland Security \u2014 which includes the Secret Service \u2014 said they expected more resignations and firings in the case. Rep. Peter T. King (R-N.Y.), chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said the 11 agents involved in the scandal underwent drug tests and polygraph exams. Agency investigators in Colombia have visited all of the hotels where Secret Service personnel stayed and have interviewed each of the maids who cleaned rooms in the Hotel Caribe, King said. \n \n People who know the two \u00adsupervisors have described Chaney\u2019s duties in the international programs division as supervising a department that provides support and administrative help to the agency\u2019s foreign of\u00adfices. Stokes has been described as the assistant special agent in charge of the K-9 training division at the James J. Rowley Training Center in Beltsville. \n \n Attempts to reach both men were unsuccessful. Calls made to Chaney\u2019s home and cellphone and to Stokes\u2019s home were not returned. No one answered the door when a reporter visited Chaney\u2019s home in Northern Virginia. Parked outside was a silver Ford pickup truck, bearing stickers with a colorful outline of Texas, Chaney\u2019s home state, and the mantra \u201cSECEDE.\u201d \n \n A relative of Chaney said she would relay a message to him. \n \n The commitment to the Secret Service runs deep in Chaney\u2019s family. His father, George Washington Chaney, was a Secret Service agent in President John F. Kennedy\u2019s era and knew the agents on his detail when Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. \n \n The elder Chaney had remarked to friends that he started at the service working \u201cdiaper duty,\u201d where he watched President Dwight D. Eisenhower\u2019s children and grandchildren in Gettysburg, Pa., and also met his wife. Later, he traveled to work in Dallas, where he was on President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s protective detail. He also served a stint in the service\u2019s El Paso office and then became the agent in charge of personnel in the D.C. headquarters, where he was working when Kennedy was shot. \n \n He retired in 1977 and started a new line of work as a document examiner in Dallas, where he and his wife raised their five children. \n \n On David Chaney\u2019s Facebook page, he posted several shots of himself with Palin. \n \n In one picture, he is wearing a dark suit and sunglasses, standing near a black vehicle behind Palin as she approaches a crowd. In the comments section next to the photo, a friend remarked that Chaney appeared to be \u201clurking in the shadows\u201d behind Palin. \n \n Another kidded that there seemed to be \u201creal chemistry\u201d between the two. \n \n Chaney posted: \u201cI was really checking her out, if you know what i mean?\u201d \n \n Another friend asked if one of the buttons on Palin\u2019s lapel was emblazoned with Chaney\u2019s face. \n \n Chaney replied, \u201cwell if it was could you blame her, anything to satisfy a stalker.\u201d \n \n In another set of Facebook photos, Chaney documents a trip he took with his grown son to Egypt. One photo shows a voluptuous belly dancer in a revealing bikini-like top and tight, sequined skirt positioned between him and his son. \n \n \u201cNot in front of my son,\u201d Chaney joked in the comments section. \n \n On Fox News Thursday night, Palin responded to the Post\u2019s revelations about Chaney\u2019s comments by saying she was disgusted that a Secret Service agent would make jokes about checking out her \u201cbackside\u201d and called his behavior \u201cpretty embarrassing.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis agent . . . was kind of ridiculous posting pictures and comments,\u201d she said. \u201cWell check this out, bodyguard. You\u2019re fired! And I hope his wife . . . kicks him into the dog house.\u201d \n \n Palin stressed she viewed the scandal as emblematic of Obama\u2019s poor management. \u201cLook who\u2019s running the show,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople will say its boys being boys. I\u2019ve had enough of these men being dogs and not being responsible for the taxpayer\u2019s dollars.\u201d \n \n Fox News host Greta Van Susteren told Palin she agreed Obama should be held accountable for how he reacted to the incident but stressed that the agent made his comments about Palin under the Bush administration. \n \n One current agent, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the investigation, said both Chaney and Stokes were respected, well-liked agents and supervisors, who were both quick to offer advice and mentor younger agents and officers. \n \n \u201cI was just completely shocked to hear they were involved,\u201d the agent said. \n \n Staff writer Ed O\u2019Keefe and staff researchers Alice Crites and Lucy Shackelford contributed to this report.",

They were beyond hungover. \n \n That's where the I.V. Doctor came in. For a few hundred dollars each, a nurse showed up with half a dozen I.V. bags and brought them back to life. \n \n The I.V. Doctor, a service started in December by New York urologist Dr. Elliot Nadelson and his surgical resident son Adam, totes intravenous hydration and other medicine to help quell hangovers to ailing New Yorkers in luxe Hamptons beach homes, and apartments and offices throughout the city. \n \n Dr. Adam Nadelson said the service has about 60 nurses in the city and 12 more in the Hamptons, who set clients up with about 200 ml of fluid, and any combination of anti-nausea, anti-heartburn and anti-inflammatory or headache medicine. The full cocktail of all the drugs, which Nadelson said is their most popular request, costs $249. \n \n Related: Can enough money buy you eternal youth? \n \n While Nadelson said his clients range from European princesses to Olympic track stars, the majority of those who use his service are in finance. It helps when they're working long hours, entertaining clients late into the night and having to perform at a high level early the next morning. \n \n \"They're burning the candle at both ends and this helps them get back on their feet quickly,\" he said. \n \n That's why Jon, a 31-year-old sales trader at a bank in New York who did not want his last name published, started calling the I.V. Doctor back in January. He was going to an event with clients for the Super Bowl and knew it was going to be a \"big night,\" so he booked an appointment at his office the next morning at 8 a.m. \n \n In a small, discrete conference room at his office, a nurse hooked him up to the I.V. bag while he checked emails for the next 40-or-so minutes, and she left in time for him to start his day. \n \n \"Look, it's not a miracle cure.

The bear chased the boy, who had run from the approaching animal, and knocked him to the ground. \n \n The boy\u2019s parents used bear spray about five feet from the animal\u2019s face, driving it off. The family walked back to the trailhead and drove to the Old Faithful Ranger Station. Rangers sent them to a nearby clinic before the boy was transferred to Big Sky Medical Center. \n \n It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what caused the bear to charge or what species it was.

The park averages one bear attack per year. \n \n Several park visitors had been injured in animal encounters earlier this year. \n \n A bison gored a woman in June following two separate elk attacks that injured two women. In May, another woman was rammed and injured by a bison. \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| A man pleaded guilty in federal court Thursday to four charges of misconduct in national parks, including a now-infamous incident of aggressively provoking a bison. \n \n Raymond Reinke, 55, was arrested in early August after video surfaced of the incident where he waves his arms and runs toward a bison. \n \n The National Park Service says the Oregon man had several run-ins with law enforcement in Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks in the weeks leading up to his arrest, including open container and public intoxication. He was also cited for disturbing wildlife after the bison video surfaced online in late July. \n \n Reinke initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, but changed his plea during Thursday's hearing to guilty. He was originally charged with five misdemeanors, but had his charges reduced to four in exchange for his guilty plea. \n \n Judge Mark Carman sentenced Reinke to 60 days in jail on the charge of harassing wildlife for the bison incident, plus 60 days for interfering with law enforcement and 10 days for disorderly conduct, for 130 days total in jail, with credit for 21 days served. \n \n Reinke has also publicly described himself as an alcoholic. \n \n In court Thursday, Reinke apologized to the bison, saying - \"I'm sorry to the buffalo. He didn't deserve what I did to him. I'm sorry, I really didn't mean to hurt that buffalo.\" \n \n Judge Carman said, \"You chased and hounded the bison. You're lucky the bison didn't take care of it, and you're standing in front of me.\" \n \n Reinke has a criminal history dating to 1991, although no felony offenses. \n \n A federal prosecutor and Carman described Reinke's behavior as the most \"egregious\" case of animal harassment they'd seen in Yellowstone. \n \n Judge Carman also emphasized that the viral video of Reinke's actions did not affect the sentencing decisions. \n \n Reinke will also be required to serve five years of unsupervised probation, in which he cannot use drugs or alcohol.

Target announced Thursday it was severing ties with the former TV chef, while shopping network QVC announced it was \"taking a pause\" in its relationship with Deen. \n \n \"After careful consideration of all available information, we have made the decision to phase out all products tied to the brand,\" a rep for Sears Holdings, which owns both Sears and KMart stores, told FOX411. \n \n A Target rep said Thursday they had \"made a decision to phase out the Paula Deen merchandise in our stores as well as on Target.com.\" \n \n Diabetes drug maker Novo Nordisk also said on Thursday the company and Deen had \"mutually agreed to suspend our patient education activities for now.\" \n \n These companies join Walmart and Caesars Entertainment (Wednesday), Smithfield Foods (Monday), and the Food Network (last Friday) in the list of companies no longer doing business with Deen. \n \n But not everyone is running fast in the other direction. \n \n The fate of her magazine \u201cCooking with Paula Deen\u201d remains unknown.

But Iranian Press TV said one of its correspondents, 33-year-old Maya Nasser, a Syrian national, died in an exchange of fire in the area following the blasts. \n \n The explosions were the latest to hit the Syrian capital as the country's civil war intensified and appeared to show the deep reach of the rebels determined to topple President Bashar Assad's regime. \n \n Syria's state-run news agency, SANA, said the explosions struck just before 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) near the landmark Omayyad Square. They were heard several miles (kilometers) away and shattered the windows of the Dama Rose hotel and other nearby buildings. \n \n The army command building was in flames, sending huge columns of thick black smoke that hung over Damascus for several hours following the blasts. \n \n Witnesses said the explosions were followed by heavy gunfire that stretched on for hours at the Omayyad Square and around the military compound. One witness who managed to get close to the area, which was cordoned off, saw panicked soldiers shooting in the air randomly as they ran. \n \n The witness, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals, said it appears that rebels may have been holed up inside the army command building, from where the sound of gunfire could clearly be heard. \n \n The British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists on the ground, said heavy clashes were taking place inside the compound of the army command, adding that there were casualties on both sides. \n \n \"The explosions shook the entire apartment and the windows shattered,\" said a resident of the nearby Abu Rummaneh district who spoke on condition of anonymity out of security concerns. \"It was like a quake.\" \n \n The army statement said the blasts were caused by a car bomb and an explosive device that went off near the army command buildings. It said \"terrorists\" in the area simultaneously opened fire randomly to terrorize people, adding that authorities were pursuing the gunmen. Syrian authorities regularly refer to rebels fighting to topple Assad's regime as terrorists. \n \n The statement said a number of guards were wounded. \n \n \"I can confirm that all our comrades in the military command and defense ministry are fine,\" Information Minister Omran Zoubi told Syrian TV, which is located near the site of the explosion, in a telephone call. \n \n \"Everything is normal,\" he said. \"There was a terrorist act, perhaps near a significant location, yes, this is true, but they failed as usual to achieve their goals.\" \n \n Ambulances were rushed to the site as police sealed off the area to traffic and journalists. Traffic in other areas snarled as checkpoints were set up, blocking access to the capital from the suburbs. \n \n Syria's unrest began in March 2011 when protests calling for political change met a violent government crackdown. Many in the opposition have since taken up arms as the conflict morphed into a civil war that activists say has killed nearly 30,000 people. Over the past few months, the rebels have increasingly targeted security sites and symbols of regime power in a bid to turn the tide in the fighting. \n \n On July 18, rebels penetrated the heart of Syria's power elite, detonating a bomb inside a high-level crisis meeting in Damascus that killed three top regime officials, including Assad's brother-in-law and the defense minister. Other large blasts have targeted the headquarters of security agencies in the capital, killing scores of people this year. \n \n On Tuesday, several bombs went off inside a Damascus school that activists said was being used by regime forces as a security headquarters. Several people were wounded. \n \n Syria's conflict was the focus of attention as world leaders gathered at the U.N. General Assembly's annual meeting in New York this week. \n \n U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon demanded international action to stop the war in Syria, telling a somber gathering of world leaders Tuesday that the 18-month conflict had become \"a regional calamity with global ramifications.\" \n \n Ban, declaring that the situation in Syria is getting worse every day, called the conflict a serious and growing threat to international peace and security that requires attention from the deeply divided U.N. Security Council. \n \n That appears highly unlikely, however, at least in the near future. \n \n Russia and China have vetoed three Western-backed resolutions aimed at pressuring Assad to end the violence and enter negotiations on a political transition, leaving the U.N.'s most powerful body paralyzed in what some diplomats say is the worst crisis since the U.S.-Soviet standoff during the Cold War. \n \n In sharp contrast to the U.N. chief, President Barack Obama pledged U.S. support for Syrians trying to oust Assad _ \"a dictator who massacres his own people.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Karam reported from Beirut. ||||| Loading ... \n \n The two were covering twin blasts in Damascus and the ensuing fighting. \n \n Insurgents in the Syrian capital Damascus have attacked Press TV staff, killing the Iranian English-language news network\u2019s correspondent Maya Naser, and injuring its Damascus Bureau Chief Hosein Mortada. Naser came under attack while reporting on air just hours ago. He was shot and killed by a sniper.

Gorka, a White House official said, disagreed with Trump\u2019s decision to dispatch more American troops to Afghanistan, a tortured decision the president outlined in his first national security address, on Tuesday night. \n \n In his resignation letter, Gorka wrote that \u201cthe fact that those who drafted and approved the speech removed any mention of Radical Islam or radical Islamic terrorism proves that a crucial element of your presidential campaign has been lost.\u201d \n \n The news of Gorka\u2019s departure was greeted with resignation by Trump loyalists, who believe the president has handed over too much power to military officers and former generals \u2014 including his new chief of staff, John Kelly, and national security adviser H.R.

That role endeared him to Trump but made him thin-skinned about the media that covered him: He often blocked mainstream-media journalists from following him on Twitter. \n \n It was not clear whether Gorka, like Bannon, would return to Breitbart News, where he previously served as national security editor. \n \n Eliana Johnson and Tim Starks contributed to this report. ||||| A pair of House Democrats unveiled proposals on Friday to cut off the salaries of controversial White House aides Stephen Miller and Sebastian Gorka. \n \n California Democratic Reps. Jared Huffman and Barbara Lee submitted amendments to a government spending package expected on the House floor after Labor Day. \n \n The language of their amendments prohibit the use of federal funds to pay the salaries of Miller and Gorka, specifically naming both aides in the legislative text. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n Miller makes $179,700 annually as an assistant to the president and senior adviser for policy, while Gorka earns $155,000 as a deputy assistant to the president and strategist, according to an official list of White House salaries. \n \n The lawmakers submitted their amendments a week after Stephen Bannon resigned as President Trump\u2019s chief strategist and returned to his post leading Breitbart News, which he once described as \u201cthe platform for the alt-right.\u201d \n \n Miller previously worked as communications director for Attorney General Jeff Sessions Jefferson (Jeff) Beauregard SessionsWarren: Trump should have fired Pruitt \u201828 scandals ago\u2019 Judge rejects Trump administration's request to block California sanctuary laws Texas nonprofit helping to reunite migrant families calls Trump an 'incompetent loser' MORE while he was serving in the Senate. Gorka, meanwhile, was a former national security editor at Breitbart. \n \n Huffman and Lee accused Miller and Gorka of encouraging white supremacists, citing Miller\u2019s involvement in Trump\u2019s travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries and Gorka's work at Breitbart. \n \n \"The removal of Steve Bannon is an important first step in rooting racism from the White House. But, Sebastian Gorka and Stephen Miller's continued presence in the West Wing ensure that Steve Bannon's sick ideology will persist in this Administration. Now is the time for Congress to take a clear stand against hate and refuse to authorize salaries of White House officials who embrace the views of white supremacists, white nationalists and Neo-Nazis,\u201d Lee said in a statement. \n \n Richard Spencer, a prominent white nationalist, told Vanity Fair that he mentored Miller while they were both at Duke University. But Miller has disputed that account and told Mother Jones in 2016 that \u201cI completely repudiate his views, and his claims are 100 percent false.\u201d \n \n Gorka drew controversy for wearing a medal from a Hungarian order, Vitezi Rend, that was founded by an ally of Adolf Hitler.

Before coming to the White House, Gorka was the Major General Matthew C. Horner Chair at Marine Corps University and also contributed to Breitbart News. \n \n Gorka\u2019s tenure at the White House was marked by unusually vociferous attacks against him and his family by left-leaning media organizations and the Democratic Party. This includes personal attacks against his wife, mother, and son. \n \n A source close to the White House said of his decision, \u201cThis was more or less going to be a done deal when Bannon submitted his resignation. Not because he didn\u2019t have a protector, but because there is no point in having your life ruined every day if you\u2019re not going to get much accomplished.\u201d The same source said that what did change after Bannon left was that anti-Bannon factions began erecting bureaucratic road blocks to undermine Gorka internally. \n \n The Forward has written dozens of attack pieces against Gorka, including several attempting to align him with Nazism. Most recently that publication retracted a story about his son\u2019s schoolwork. Gorka strenuously objected to allegations he had ties to Nazi groups in his family\u2019s home country of Hungary, where he had previously been involved in national politics. Even detractors eventually acknowledged the Nazi accusations were unfair smears. \n \n In his letter, Gorka made clear that he believes in the promise of the Trump presidency despite being concerned about its present direction. \n \n \u201cYour presidency will prove to be one of the most significant events in modern American politics. November the 8th was the result of decades during which the political and media elites felt that they knew better than the people who elect them into office.

She said speed-limit signs are posted two miles before the lowered speed zone and then just before the zone. \n \n \u201cEngineers are trained to slow trains according to posted speeds,\u201d she said. \n \n Learn more about Traffic Lab \u00bb Traffic Lab is a Seattle Times project that digs into the region\u2019s thorny transportation issues, spotlights promising approaches to easing gridlock, and helps readers find the best ways to get around. It is funded with the help of community sponsors Alaska Airlines, CenturyLink, Kemper Development Co., PEMCO Mutual Insurance Company, Sabey Corp., Seattle Children\u2019s hospital and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates. Seattle Times editors and reporters operate independently of our funders and maintain editorial control over Traffic Lab content. \n \n Daniel Konzelman, who was driving on I-5 south parallel to the train, said he was traveling at 60 mph or more and watched the train pass his vehicle about a half-mile before the crash. A website that monitors locations and speeds of Amtrak trains, transitdocs.com, reported that the train was going about 81 mph shortly before the derailment, The Associated Press reported. \n \n A late-night news conference by National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) officials verified the train was going 80 mph in the 30 mph zone. Officials said they had no other information. \n \n Russell Quimby, a consultant who was previously an investigator-in-charge for the NTSB, said it appeared to him that the derailment was caused by speed. He said the track appeared relatively undisturbed, so it seemed unlikely that something knocked the train off the track, and he noted that it appeared the train drove in a straight line, missing the turn. \n \n The railway route had recently undergone a $181 million retrofit program in order to speed up passenger service that previously traveled away from the freeway and along the coast. Part of that retrofit was to include \u201cpositive train control\u201d systems that can prevent dangerous situations such as excessive speed. \n \n The 14.5-mile corridor is now equipped for positive train control equipment, but the train controls aren\u2019t operating yet in that area, said Amtrak CEO Richard Anderson. An Amtrak spokesman said the equipment was still being tested. \n \n Federal safety officials have been pushing for the implementation of those control systems for years, including in 1993 after a head-on crash between freight trains killed five crewmen in Kelso, Cowlitz County. Congress first mandated in 2008 that they be put in use by the end of 2015. \n \n Since then, other fatal passenger-train accidents have also come from speeding trains that did not have the train control system installed. That includes 2013 Metro-North commuter train in the Bronx and a 2015 Amtrak crash in Philadelphia, when a train traveling more than twice the speed limit went off the tracks, killing eight people. \n \n In Washington state, Amtrak suspended a train engineer earlier this year after a derailment near Steilacoom, Pierce County. Officials blamed speed and human error in that case, saying the engineer approached a drawbridge going faster than the 40-mph speed limit. \n \n While there has been progress on implementing train controls \u2013 Amtrak says it completed installation in 2015 of the systems on most Amtrak-owned routes on the Northeast Corridor \u2013 the congressional mandate on train controls has been delayed until the end of 2018. Lawmakers have also left open the possibility of another delay until 2020. \n \n Deborah Hersman, a former NTSB chairwoman who now leads the Chicago-based National Safety Council, said the technology is old and already in use in European and Asian countries with high-speed rail systems. \n \n \u201cPeople have this technology in their phones,\u201d she said. \u201cA Pok\u00e9mon app can tell you you\u2019re driving and disable the app.\u201d \n \n Watch: \n \n Here\u2019s what we know about the Amtrak train derailment \n \n An Amtrak passenger train derailed near Olympia on Monday morning. It had been southbound from Seattle on the inaugural run of a new route. Transportation reporter Mike Lindblom explains what we know. (The Seattle Times) \n \n Times staff reporters Christine Willmsen, Evan Bush and Mike Lindblom contributed to this report. ||||| CONTINUING UPDATES: Train was 50 mph over limit before deadly derailment \n \n An Amtrak train making the inaugural run of a new route between Portland and Seattle derailed at high speed early Monday morning near Olympia, killing three and sending more than 70 to hospitals when railcars hurtled off an overpass onto vehicles traveling on Interstate 5 below. \n \n Authorities haven't released the names of those killed or hurt when 13 cars of the Portland-bound train jumped the tracks while traveling about 80 mph in Dupont, about 40 miles south of Seattle. At least 10 victims suffered serious injuries, authorities said. \n \n Kimberly Reason with Sound Transit, the Seattle-area transit agency that owns the tracks, confirmed to The Associated Press that the speed limit at the point where the train derailed is 30 mph. Speed signs are posted two miles before the speed zone and immediately before the speed zone approaching the curve where the train left the tracks, she said. \n \n Positive train control \u2014 a technology that can slow or stop a speeding train \u2014 wasn't in use on the stretch of track, according to Amtrak President Richard Anderson. \n \n Amtrak derailment occurred on highly anticipated new route \n \n The Associated Press mid-afternoon Monday cited a U.S. official as saying the train hit something that sent it off the tracks. The official was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity; by mid-evening that account had not been confirmed. \n \n Earlier reports had said as many as six were killed. But at a news conference early Monday night, officials with the Washington State Patrol and West Pierce Fire and Rescue Officials said three had died. They did not address the discrepancy. \n \n It was unclear whether the deaths were I-5 travelers or those on the train, which carried 80 passengers, five crew members and a technician. State patrol later announced 72 people were transported to hospitals from the scene including four with moderate injuries and nine with minor injuries. There were 19 people who weren't hurt and have since been reunited with their families. \n \n Washington State Patrol spokeswoman Brooke Bova said investigators are expected to work through the night at the scene. Members of the National Transportation Safety Board are involved, she said. \n \n Southbound I-5 was closed indefinitely, and northbound travelers were caught in a massive backup throughout Monday. \n \n Washington State Patrol Chief John Batiste said cranes were being brought in to help remove rail cars. The state Department of Transportation will need to inspect the bridge before reopening southbound Interstate 5, he said. \n \n The southbound stretch is expected to remain closed during the Tuesday morning commute and possibly for several days, transportation authorities said, who asked drivers to avoid the highway in either direction near DuPont and find alternate routes. \n \n Jay Sumerlin, a West Pierce Fire and Rescue battalion chief, said the rescue effort wasn't easy, particularly because some train cars were dangling from the overpass. He said jaw tools, air chisels and different forms of saws were used to get into some of the crushed cars. Ladders were also used to reach victims. \n \n \"It was just a difficult place to be,\" he said. \n \n Sumerlin described the day as shocking and surreal because crews have had mock training scenarios involving train cars dangling over a highway. \n \n \"Everybody comes in and goes, 'That's not going to happen.' Well, here we are, it's exactly what happened,\" he said. \"I'm glad we trained to that level, because today was one of those days.\" \n \n President Donald Trump tweeted his first public comments on the crash mid-morning, connecting the derailment to a need for increased spending on infrastructure. \n \n \"The train accident that just occurred in DuPont, WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly. Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads, bridges, tunnels, railways (and more) crumble! Not for long!\" \n \n Derailment turns excitement to dismay at Portland's Union Station. \n \n Officials have not established that infrastructure played a role in the derailment. \n \n About 10 minutes later, he tweeted again, saying his \"thoughts and prayers\" were with everyone involved and praising the first responders. \n \n Bloodworks Northwest issued an urgent appeal for blood, especially O-type blood, AB plasma and platelets. Donations can be made at 9320 N.E. Vancouver Mall Drive, Suite 100, Vancouver, WA 98662. For more information, go to bloodworksnw.org or call 800-398-7888. \n \n Amtrak released a statement late Monday afternoon, saying it was working closely with families of passengers. It established a Passenger Reception Center and public hotline at 800-523-9101 for those with question about family or friends. \n \n Anderson, the Amtrak president, said he was \"deeply saddened by all that has happened today.\" \n \n In a radio transmission immediately after the accident, a railroad employee who was onboard can be heard saying the train had been coming around a corner and crossing a bridge that passed over I- 5 when it derailed. \n \n \"We've got cars everywhere and down onto the highway,\" he tells a dispatcher, who asks if everyone is OK. \"I'm still figuring that out.\" \n \n The train was part of Amtrak's Cascades service, which is owned by the Washington Department of Transportation in partnership with the Oregon Department of Transportation. The daily service is run by Amtrak as a contractor. \n \n Some Amtrak trains continued to run between Portland and Seattle, bypassing the scene of the derailment. The rail system said trains 504 and 509 had been canceled, and that no alternate transportation would be provided. \n \n But it had not canceled other scheduled trains, including 517, 505 and 507 from Seattle to Portland and trains 518, 14, 506 and 508 from Portland to Seattle. \n \n Washington Gov. Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency. \n \n The new train route was part of a $180.7 million project intended to cut 10 minutes off the stretch between Tacoma and Olympia by running alongside I-5 instead of hugging the Puget Sound. It also had fewer curves - limiting the need to slow down - and single-track tunnels where passenger trains must yield to passing freight trains. \n \n Track testing began in January and February in advance of Monday's launch and continued through at least July, according to the Washington State Department of Transportation. \n \n The tracks, known as the Point Defiance Bypass, were previously owned by BNSF and were used for occasional freight and military transport. \n \n Don Anderson, the mayor of Lakewood, Washington, a city along the route, had been critical of the new line, and he had predicted a deadly crash. But Anderson thought it would involve a fast-moving train hitting a car or pedestrian at a crossing. \n \n Doug Mitchem, 68, got up Monday morning in his Centralia home and turned the TV on. News of the derailment came on, and Mitchem started to worry, he told The Oregonian/OregonLive in an interview. \n \n His son Drew, an avid train enthusiast, had planned to ride the train from Tacoma to Olympia with a friend because they wanted to be on the first train on this new track. \n \n Mitchem tried to call his son's cell phone, but no answer. He tried a few more times. Still nothing. Then, around 8:20 a.m., he got a call from a woman who said she had seen Drew, who was OK. Paramedics had taken him to Allenmore hospital in Tacoma with a few broken ribs and, possibly, a broken back. \n \n Half an hour later, Drew Mitchem called his father from the hospital. He said he had been hurled from the train. \n \n Doug Mitchem said he will go with a daughter and grandson to see his son tomorrow. He's going to bring him a set of fresh clothes, he said, because Drew clothes had to be cut off. \n \n In Portland, other train enthusiasts had been ensconced in Union Station from about 6 a.m., excited to greet the first train on the new line. \n \n Dan McFarling, 70, was there with a therapy dog to talk to people about the importance and safety of rail travel. A longtime member of the Association of Oregon Rail and Transit Advocates, he said he was in shock when he first heard the news. \n \n \"It immediately made me realize our role today would be different that what we had planned,\" McFarling said, choking up. \n \n Mid-afternoon, about 10 passengers who had been on the derailed train arrived at Union Station by bus. They declined to speak to the media, but Red Cross spokeswoman Monique Dugaw said the disaster relief organization was working to take care of their immediate needs. \n \n \"We're talking with them,\" she said, \"making sure they have the next steps in place to have a hotel room or to be reunited with their family.\" \n \n Dugaw described the passengers as \"in shock.\" \n \n Hundreds of people came to the aid of those involved in the derailment, according to those at the scene. Among the Good Samaritans was Nate Selden, a Portland neurosurgeon, who helped two dozen people. \n \n Selden was driving to Seattle with his son, when traffic slowed a few miles south of the derailment. When they got to the scene, Selden quickly started helping first responders triage victims. \n \n The younger patient he saw was an infant that had been thrown from their mother's arms. But the baby seemed OK. \n \n \"This little infant appeared completely unharmed,\" Selden said, calling that incident \"one of few moments of joy in that devastating scene.\" \n \n Reporters Fedor Zarkhin, Jim Ryan, Lizzy Acker, Elliot Njus, Molly Harbarger and Molly Young contributed to this report. \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| Cars from an Amtrak train lay spilled onto Interstate 5 below alongside smashed vehicles as some train cars remain on the tracks above Monday, Dec. 18, 2017, in DuPont, Wash.

The Amtrak train making the first-ever run along a faster new route hurtled off the overpass Monday near Tacoma and spilled some... (Associated Press) \n \n DUPONT, Wash. (AP) \u2014 Federal officials confirmed an Amtrak train was hurtling 50 mph over the speed limit when it careened off an overpass south of Seattle, spilling cars onto the highway below and killing at least three people. \n \n Bella Dinh-Zarr, a National Transportation Safety Board member, said at a Monday night news conference that information from the event data recorder in the rear locomotive showed the train was traveling at 80 mph in a 30 mph zone when it derailed at 7:34 a.m. Mangled train cars ended up on top of each other - and one hung precariously over the freeway. \n \n When the clanging of metal and screeching stopped at first it was quiet. Then came the screams. \n \n After the crash, the injured called out as rescuers \u2014 including people who had been in cars on their morning freeway commute \u2014 rushed to help. One of the train passengers was Emma Shafer, who found herself at a 45-degree angle staring at the seats in front of her that had dislodged and swung around. \n \n \"It felt oddly silent after the actual crashing,\" Shafer said. \"Then there was people screaming because their leg was messed up ... I don't know if I actually heard the sirens, but they were there. A guy was like, 'Hey, I'm Robert. We'll get you out of here.'\" \n \n Dinh-Zarr said it's not yet known what caused the train to derail and that \"it's too early to tell\" why it was going so fast. \n \n Positive train control \u2014 the technology that can slow or stop a speeding train \u2014 wasn't in use on this stretch of track, according to Amtrak President Richard Anderson. \n \n In 2015, an Amtrak train in Philadelphia was traveling at twice the 50 mph speed limit as it entered a sharp curve and derailed. Eight people were killed and more than 200 were injured when the locomotive and four of the train's seven passenger cars jumped the tracks. Several cars overturned and ripped apart. \n \n A track chart prepared by the Washington State Department of Transportation shows the maximum speed drops from 79 mph (127 kph) to 30 mph (48 kph) for passenger trains just before the tracks curve to cross Interstate 5, which is where the train went off the tracks. \n \n The chart, dated Feb. 7, was submitted to the Federal Railroad Administration in anticipation of the start of passenger service along a new bypass route that shaves off 10 minutes for the trip between Seattle and Portland, Oregon. \n \n Kimberly Reason with Sound Transit, the Seattle-area transit agency that owns the tracks, said speed signs are posted 2 miles (3 kilometers) before the speed zone changes and just before the speed zone approaching the curve. \n \n Eric Corp, a councilman for the small city of DuPont near the derailment, said he rode the train with about 30 or so dignitaries and others on a special trip Friday before the service opened to the public Monday. \n \n \"Once we were coming up on that curve, the train slowed down considerably,\" he said, adding that \"in no way did it make me feel like we were going too fast.\" \n \n The train was not full. Authorities said there were 80 passengers and five on-duty crew members on board when it derailed and pulled 13 cars off the tracks. Authorities said there were three confirmed deaths. More than 70 people were taken for medical care \u2014 including 10 with serious injuries. \n \n About two hours after the accident, a U.S. official who was briefed on the investigation said he was told at least six people were killed. The official said he had no new information to explain the discrepancy in the numbers. The official was not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity. \n \n In a statement, the FBI said local police were the primary responders and there was no information suggesting \"an elevated risk to Washington residents.\" \n \n In a radio transmission immediately after the accident, the conductor can be heard saying the train was coming around a corner and was crossing a bridge that passed over Interstate 5 when it derailed. \n \n Dispatch audio also indicated that the engineer survived with bleeding from the head and both eyes swollen shut. \n \n \"I'm still figuring that out. We've got cars everywhere and down onto the highway,\" he tells the dispatcher, who asks if everyone is OK. \n \n Aleksander Kristiansen, a 24-year-old exchange student at the University of Washington from Copenhagen, was going to Portland to visit the city for the day. \n \n \"I was just coming out of the bathroom when the accident happened. My car just started shaking really, really badly,\" he said. \n \n The back of his train car was wide open because it had separated from the rest of the train, so he and others were able to jump out to safety. \n \n The train was making the inaugural run on the new route as part of a $180.7 million project designed to speed up service by removing passenger trains from a route along Puget Sound that's bogged down by curves, single-track tunnels and freight traffic. \n \n The new bypass was built on an existing inland rail line that runs along Interstate 5 from Tacoma to DuPont, near where Train 501 derailed. \n \n ___ \n \n This story has been updated to reflect that authorities said Monday night that three people died.

Mosby remaining at the helm of the prosecution. \n \n During a day of hearings in a downtown courtroom, Judge Barry Williams swiftly sliced through complex legal arguments in the first motions hearing. In three key rulings issued from the bench, he refused to dismiss the charges or recuse Mosby and decided that the case should be split to ensure that each officer gets a fair trial. \n \n Williams said that trying the officers together would not be \"in the interest of justice\" because key evidence that's admissible with regards to one officer may be inadmissible for another. The officers are charged with a range of offenses, from murder to misconduct, as each played a different role in Gray's arrest and transport. \n \n The case has sparked widespread protests in Baltimore \u2014 which continued Wednesday \u2014 and has become part of a national dialogue about police treatment of black citizens. Gray, 25, died in April one week after suffering a severe spinal cord injury while in police custody. \n \n Outside the courtroom, dozens of protesters gathered in peaceful demonstrations and marches through downtown that resulted in one arrest and snarled traffic. Even at this early stage of the court proceedings, organizers said they wanted their voices heard. \n \n \"It's a step in the right direction,\" Malcolm Wilson said of Williams' rulings on defense motions to recuse Mosby and dismiss the case. The 23-year-old East Baltimore resident, who said he knew Gray, clutched a white cardboard sign that read, \"I am here for Justice for Mr. Gray.\" \n \n Police, who had been criticized for their response to previous demonstrations and rioting, repeatedly ordered protesters to \"remain on the sidewalk\" and quickly responded to one tense moment near the Inner Harbor in which a protester was arrested and an officer suffered minor injuries. \n \n Interim Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said police wanted to treat \"a protest like a protest,\" and that \"by and large, that's exactly what happened.\" Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake praised the department, saying she and police \"will vigorously defend the First Amendment rights of the protesters, but we will also vigorously enforce the order in our city.\" \n \n In the courtroom, filled with legal observers and media after months of sharply written legal filings filled with accusations lobbed between the defense and prosecution, Williams sought to maintain order. \n \n He stopped the proceedings to remind those present to turn off all electronics, warning that he would remove everyone but the attorneys. He frequently interrupted the attorneys during their arguments, to seek clarification on a key point, wryly disagree or keep the attorneys on topic. \n \n The officers had waived their rights to attend Wednesday's hearing, and Gray's family did not attend. \n \n While the oral arguments on the dismissal and recusal motions largely reflected those made in written filings \u2014 which often centered on Mosby's actions \u2014 the arguments over whether to try the officers separately provided new insights into defense and prosecution theories. \n \n Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr., the driver of the police van in which Gray was injured, is charged with second-degree depraved-heart murder. Sgt. Alicia D. White, Lt. Brian W. Rice and Officer William G. Porter are charged with manslaughter. Officers Edward M. Nero and Garrett E. Miller face lesser charges, including second-degree assault. All six have been charged with misconduct in office. \n \n Partially redacted statements by several of the officers were submitted to the court on Wednesday, though under seal, as were police dispatch tapes. \n \n Prosecutors previously indicated that they wanted to try Goodson, White, Nero and Miller together in one trial, and Porter and Rice together in a second trial. \n \n However, at the hearing Wednesday, they only sought to have Goodson, White and Nero tried together. Deputy State's Attorney Janice Bledsoe argued that much of the evidence in the case was relevant to those three officers. \n \n She said all of the evidence related to what happened to Gray from his arrest to his arrival unresponsive at the Western District police station would be needed to prove reckless endangerment on their part. \n \n But Marc Zayon, Nero's attorney, said Gray's arrest and transport constituted two separate incidents. He said evidence brought to support the felony charges against Goodson and White, including expert witness testimony on Gray's injuries sustained in the van and evidence regarding how Goodson was driving, would be highly prejudicial if introduced in a case against Nero. \n \n Defense attorneys also raised concerns that statements by the officers could incriminate one of the co-defendants, pitting one's right not to take the stand with another's right to confront his or her accuser. \n \n Matthew Fraling, an attorney for Goodson, also said he was concerned about a \"transfer of guilt\" and a \"spillover effect\" in the minds of jurors trying to categorize evidence against different defendants. \n \n In denying the state's motion to join the cases, Williams agreed that much of the evidence would not be \"mutually admissible.\" His ruling means there will be six trials. \n \n Arguments over dismissing the charges and recusing Mosby came after a flurry of heatedly written motions over the past four months. In court Wednesday, Williams cautioned both sides to tone down their rhetoric. \n \n \"The unnecessary name calling and over-the-top rhetoric to which this court has been required to wade in order to get to the heart of the legal issues in this case is remarkable,\" Williams said.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Written motions finally evolved into verbal arguments this morning in Baltimore, where defense attorneys for two of the six officers charged in the arrest and death of Freddie Gray tried to have said charges dismissed and the office of State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby recused from the case\u2014attempts that were both rejected by Judge Barry Williams, the Baltimore Sun reports. The defense attorneys argued, among other things, that Mosby had influenced the jury pool by \"[adopting] and [encouraging] the public's cry of 'no justice, no peace'\" when she publicly announced the charges against the officers in May. Another complaint by the defense: Mosby's judgment was influenced by her husband serving as councilman for a local district that saw a \"disproportionate amount of violence\" in the days after Gray's death, the AP reports. Williams called that assertion \"condescending\" and said while he was \"troubled\" by some of Mosby's comments during her May 1 news conference, the defendants' right to a fair trial wasn't compromised by her statements, per the AP. The hearing is expected to continue this afternoon to determine whether the trial for the six officers should be split up.

Credit: Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future As much as 47 percent of the edible U.S. seafood supply is lost each year, mainly from consumer waste, new research from the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future (CLF) suggests. \n \n The findings, published in the November issue of Global Environmental Change, come as food waste in general has been in the spotlight and concerns have been raised about the sustainability of the world's seafood resources. In the U.S. and around the world, people are being advised to eat more seafood, but overfishing, climate change, pollution, habitat destruction and the use of fish for other purposes besides human consumption threaten the global seafood supply. \n \n \"If we're told to eat significantly more seafood but the supply is severely threatened, it is critical and urgent to reduce waste of seafood,\" says study leader David Love, PhD, a researcher with the Public Health and Sustainable Aquaculture project at the CLF and an assistant scientist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \n \n The new study analyzed the food waste issue by focusing on the amount of seafood lost annually at each stage of the food supply chain and at the consumer level. \n \n After compiling data from many sources, the researchers estimated the U.S. edible seafood supply at approximately 4.7 billion pounds per year, which includes domestic and imported products minus any exported products. Some of the edible seafood supply is wasted as it moves through the supply chain from hook or net to plate. They found that the amount wasted each year is roughly 2.3 billion pounds. Of that waste, they say that 330 million pounds are lost in distribution and retail, 573 million pounds are lost when commercial fishers catch the wrong species of fish and then discard it (a concept called bycatch) and a staggering 1.3 billion pounds are lost at the consumer level. \n \n The researchers found the greatest portion of seafood loss occurred at the level of consumers (51 to 63 percent of waste). Sixteen to 32 percent of waste is due to bycatch, while 13 to 16 percent is lost in distribution and retail operations. To illustrate the magnitude of the loss, the authors estimate this lost seafood could contain enough protein to fulfill the annual requirements for as many as 10 million men or 12 million women; and there is enough seafood lost to close 36 percent of the gap between current seafood consumption and the levels recommended by the 2010 U.S. Dietary Guidelines. \n \n The 2010 U.S. Dietary Guidelines recommended increasing seafood consumption to eight ounces per person per week and consuming a variety of seafood in place of some meat and poultry. Yet achieving those levels would require doubling the U.S. seafood supply, the researchers say. \n \n Waste reduction has the potential to support increased seafood consumption without further stressing aquatic resources, says Roni Neff, PhD, director of the Food System Sustainability & Public Health Program at CLF and an assistant professor with the Bloomberg School of Public Health. She says that while a portion of the loss could be recovered for human consumption, \"we do not intend to suggest that all of it could or should become food for humans.\" \n \n \"It would generally be preferable for the fish that becomes bycatch to be left alive in the water rather than eaten, and due to seafood's short shelf life, it may be particularly challenging compared to other food items to get the remaining seafood eaten or frozen before it decays,\" she says. Instead, focusing on prevention strategies involving governments, businesses and consumers can reduce seafood loss and create a more efficient and sustainable seafood system. \n \n The researchers offer several approaches to reduce seafood waste along the food chain from catch to consumer. Suggestions range from limiting the percent of bycatch that can be caught at the production level to packaging seafood into smaller portion sizes at the processing level to encouraging consumer purchases of frozen seafood. Some loss is unavoidable, but the researchers hope these estimates and suggestions will help stimulate dialogue about the significance and magnitude of seafood loss. \n \n Explore further: Rethinking fish farming to offset its public health and environmental risks \n \n More information: \"Wasted seafood in the United States: Quantifying loss from production to consumption and moving toward solutions\" was written by Dave C.

Those numbers come from a new study published in Global Environmental Change that found up to 47% of the US' edible seafood supply goes uneaten every year. Some of that is the fault of fishermen catching the wrong species or product lost during distribution and retail.

The 2.3 billion pounds of edible seafood that goes uneaten is enough protein to sustain more than 10 million people for a year.

Museum workers boarded up the expansive windows of the Viking Ship Museum in Roskilde, 40 kilometres west of Copenhagen, amid fears water from the fjord would rise and shatter the glass. \n \n Police in Denmark ordered the evacuation of people in the towns of Frederikssund and Frederiksvaerk, 40 kilometres northeast of Copenhagen, because of imminent flooding. The towns lie on the Roskilde fjord, which has seen water levels rise noticeably. \n \n Hamburg airport, where almost all flights were cancelled late Thursday, was open for business on Friday but cautioned that there would be cancellations because of wind and snow. Trains northward from Hamburg to Denmark and some other destinations were cancelled. \n \n Tidal floods that hit Hamburg in the early morning were akin to those that drenched the city in 1962, causing the worst flooding in living memory. But higher and better coastal defences along the North Sea these days meant the impact of this week's storm on the city was negligible, with no reports of major damage or loss of life. \n \n A further tidal surge is expected to hit Hamburg Friday evening. \n \n Soccer club Werder Bremen, whose game Saturday against German champion Bayern Munich had been in doubt, announced on Twitter Friday morning that flood water hadn't topped a levee near its stadium and the match would go ahead. \n \n Meanwhile, wind farms in Germany reaped benefits from the storm. \n \n According to European Energy Exchange AG, an energy trading platform, production of wind energy in Germany surged in recent days. \n \n At 1 p.m. local time the country's vast network of on- and offshore wind turbines produced 25,205.8 MW of electricity \u2014 the equivalent of 25 nuclear plants and almost 35 per cent of the country's total energy output that hour. ||||| Story highlights Washington, Philadelphia will see snow Sunday, warm up Monday \n \n Very low temperatures remain across the United States \n \n Dallas should thaw out a little on Sunday \n \n Few takers for free football tickets in Dallas \n \n A frigid winter storm system that put Dallas in the deep freeze will hit the East Coast on Sunday.

Firefighters dove into the frigid water and towed the truck to the bridge. The unidentified driver died. A passenger was killed Thursday when a vehicle lost control and crashed into another car in Hockley County, the Texas Department of Public Safety said. \n \n In Arkansas man was killed late Thursday when a tree fell on his camper in Pope County, the Department of Emergency Management said. Highway Patrol officials in Oklahoma blamed at least one death, in Muskogee, on the weather. In New Mexico, one person died when a semi crashed near Clines Corners. \n \n The storm took a toll on travel, causing hundreds of car crashes and forcing the cancellation of hundreds of departures at Dallas/FortWorth International Airport. The FAA said Saturday operations had returned to normal. Abandoned cars littered the interstate outside Dallas. \n \n Winter came much earlier than usual in many sections of the nation. \n \n Farmersburg, Indiana, recorded up to 10 inches of snow Thursday and temperatures fell into the single digits at night. \"This was early for us to have this much measurable snow late in the fall, but has happened before,\" Mark Ivy told CNN iReport. \"It is more the cold that is unusual.\" \n \n In East Kingsford, Michigan, iReporter Jason Asselin said he's covering blankets to keep you the cold. \"In December, our average temperatures are in the 20s,\" he said. \"Currently it is zero degrees outside.\" \n \n Across the High Plains and into the Great Lakes, temperatures were expected to be 10 to 35 degrees below average, with wind chill values predicted to reach 35 to 45 degrees below zero in some areas. \n \n From the central Appalachians through central New England, snow is expected into early Saturday morning, the National Weather Service said. \n \n It was cold in Memphis, Tennessee, for a second straight day, with a high of 24 degrees. The weather will be a little warmer Sunday and Monday, with the mercury creeping up to 36 and 43 degrees, respectively. \n \n The governors of Tennessee and Arkansas declared states of emergency ahead of the worst of the storm.",

You bet: Unlikely ice storms hammered southern states yesterday, depriving thousands of power, forcing hundreds of flight cancellations, and killing at least five people, CNN reports. It's not over, either: Storms are poised to strike regions from Dallas to Memphis until tomorrow and Arkansas through Monday. The north will also get its share, with sleet or snow hitting central New England through the central Appalachians into today, and blanketing the nation's capital tomorrow. In other details: Dallas/Forth Worth had it worst, canceling nearly 700 flights and the downtown Dallas holiday parade for the first time in 26 years. The storm cut out power for more than 200,000 customers. Temperature swings were shocking: In Hot Springs, Arkansas, a temperate 75-degree day on Wednesday turned into an ice storm yesterday. Most fatalities occurred on icy roads, including the death of Granby, Missouri, Mayor Ronald Arnall, whose car veered off a state highway in southern Missouri and hit a tree, Reuters reports. Oklahoma alone has recorded about 116 storm-related injuries. A new storm struck the Pacific Coast yesterday, dropping pretty heavy snow on Portland. Even Las Vegas might see snow today\u2014up to 2 inches.

According to CNN, that's more than double the amount of snow that fell in the region at this time last year. In other words, it's going to be a record-breaking storm. In addition to the expected snow, the AP reports the storm will bring with it a deluge of cold air.

    "document": "U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords sang the folk-rock song \"American Pie\" over the weekend - and knew all the words, her rabbi says. \n \n Rabbi Stephanie Aaron of Congregation Chaverim, which Giffords attends, visited the congresswoman in Houston and plans another visit soon. She said one of her friends, a rabbi in Houston, is also visiting with Giffords regularly. \n \n Giffords, 40, is recovering from a gunshot wound to the head at TIRR Memorial Hermann in Houston, where her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, lives. She was one of 19 people shot Jan. 8 at a northwest-side supermarket as she held a meet-and-greet event. Six people died. \n \n \"I sang a prayer with her,\" Aaron said. \"She also sang 'American Pie' and she knew all the words. She was singing it with Mark and Mark's daughters, who noticed that she knew the words better than they did.\" \n \n Giffords was shot in the left forehead and the bullet went clear through the left side of the brain, which typically controls right-side strength, sensation and speech. \n \n Giffords' medical team has been encouraging her to mouth the words to songs as part of an exercise known to rebuild the brain. \n \n During her visit to Houston, Aaron said Giffords overheard the rabbi talking about going to get matzo-ball soup for her. And when Aaron returned from the deli, Giffords looked at her and said, \"Soup?\" \n \n \"She's determined,\" Aaron said. \"She's being her brilliant, amazing self.\" \n \n Aaron brought a large poster-board card from students at Emily Gray Junior High School, where Giffords was once a student. \n \n The card included a picture of Emily Gray students standing with Giffords and her husband. When she saw the picture, Giffords touched the part of the picture that showed her with Kelly. \n \n The students had also put an Emily Gray T-shirt inside the card. Giffords reached out, grasped it and held it close to her heart, Aaron said. \n \n \"She's really trying,\" Aaron said. \"And Mark is with her every minute.\" \n \n Traumatic brain injuries can affect a person's ability to concentrate and remember, as well as cause problems with balance and coordination. Many survivors are severely disabled. \n \n Experts have said it's a good sign that Giffords is talking, but that she still has a long, difficult road to recovery. \n \n The first reports of Giffords speaking came last week, when a staff member confirmed the congresswoman asked for toast with her breakfast. There have also been reports of her mouthing the words to \"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,\" as friends sang along. \n \n Contact reporter Stephanie Innes at sinnes@azstarnet.com or 573-4134. ||||| A veteran city firefighter's refusal to respond to the Jan. 8 shooting spree, citing \"political bantering,\" may have slowed his Tucson Fire Department unit's response to the incident that left six dead and 13 wounded, city memos show. \n \n The firefighter, Mark Ekstrum, retired from his 28-year career two days later, while his supervisors were still considering how to discipline him, internal memos obtained by the Arizona Daily Star in a public-records request show. \n \n In a Jan. 9 report on Ekstrum's actions, fire Capt. Ben Williams wrote that when Ekstrum first told him he would not go out on the call, \"he mentioned something about 'political bantering' and he did not want to be part of it.\" He said he was acting \"for the good of the crew.\" \n \n Williams said he told Ekstrum he could not refuse a call for that reason, and then talked to the firefighter privately in his office. He said Ekstrum \"started to say something about how he had a much different political viewpoint than the rest of the crew and he was concerned.\" Despite being told that was not acceptable, Williams said Ekstrum informed him he was going home \"sick,\" so they answered the call without him. \n \n In a statement provided to the Fire Department late Wednesday, after he was contacted by the Star about the incident, Ekstrum said he was distraught over the shootings and had no problem with U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who is recovering from a bullet wound to the brain, and even voted for her in the last election. \n \n Ekstrum was on duty at a station on the far southeast side and was part of a team specially trained to handle large medical emergencies. While the crew was not among those called first to the shooting scene - they were not dispatched until about 90 minutes after the shootings - a memo from Ekstrum's supervisor said his actions caused \"confusion and delay\" in the emergency circumstances. The department previously sent several paramedic units to the Safeway at North Oracle Road and West Ina Road. \n \n The Fire Department later backtracked from that statement, saying Ekstrum's actions caused delay during the preparatory process, but did not cause a delay of the actual call. \n \n However, one of the fire engines had to stop at another fire station to pick up personnel to take Ekstrum's place. \n \n Crews at Tucson Fire's Station 6,10251 S. Wilmot Road, were dispatched at 12:03 p.m. Jan. 8, seven minutes after the last patient arrived at the hospital, said Joe Gulotta, an assistant fire chief. They responded as a support crew, in a non-emergency way with the Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS), a large delivery truck with tents, medical supplies, water and cots, used after the shootings to assist those who were not seriously injured. \n \n Williams said he told Ekstrum they all have differences, but they put those differences aside and respond as professionals, the memo said. However, Ekstrum said \"I'm leaving, I am going home,\" the memo said, and Williams said at that time he realized arguing was pointless and time was wasting so he told Ekstrum to go. \n \n After the crew returned from the call, Ekstrum was waiting at the station with his wife and asked if he could come in to apologize to the crew, the memo said. The crew accepted his apology, and then Williams talked in his office with Ekstrum and his wife. \n \n \"He stated that there were underlying issues regarding the call that brought up a lot of anger and made him ineffective as a firefighter,\" the memo said. \"I told him that as his captain I had lost confidence in his future ability to perform his duties. He stated that he felt this call was unique and did not think this would happen again.\" \n \n When contacted at his house Wednesday, and later by telephone, Ekstrum declined to comment. \n \n However, in the statement he submitted to the department late Wednesday - a statement the department was not expecting - he said he was distraught over the shootings and was \"distracted to the point of not being able to perform my routine station duties to such an extent that I seriously doubted my ability to focus on an emergency call.\" \n \n He said he failed to effectively communicate that was the reason he needed to go home and \"my communication centered more on how this event would affect the country and them and us, and, of course, led to their misunderstanding about my need to go home because I was at a point of distraction.\" \n \n Ekstrum said he realized the next day, \"I had crossed a line with myself in relation to our citizens. I should have been there, regardless of how responsible I was attempting to be from the standpoint of distraction.\" \n \n Ekstrum said he decided to retire right then, without knowing that the Tucson Fire Department was starting a disciplinary action against him. \n \n He said in his statement that he voted for Giffords in the last election, and spoke with her early on in her tenure about a communication vehicle that TFD had for mass-casualty incidents. \"She asked many pertinent and intelligent questions,\" Ekstrum said. \"She has always impressed me as a person that was willing to listen.\" \n \n Ekstrum has been registered as an independent since 1999, Pima County Recorder's Office records show, after being registered as a Democrat for the previous 17 years. He did not appear to be very politically active. The records show he hadn't voted in a primary election in 28 years and his name couldn't be found in campaign finance records as a donor. \n \n Williams recommended a 20-day suspension, the maximum sanction for a first time offense. In his memo, he said, \"I look forward to getting past this incident so that we may work together again in the future.\" \n \n However, Gulotta initially said Ekstrum's behavior fit the \"most egregious category in our discipline matrix,\" and he likely would have faced termination if he had not retired. \n \n But later, after seeing Ekstrum's Wednesday statement, Gulotta said the department's reaction to Ekstrum's actions would have been different. It would have first sent him to a city doctor to measure his fitness for duty and then could have simply disciplined him, or potentially fired him, but Gulotta said exactly what would have happened is unknown. \n \n Fire Union President Roger Tamietti declined to comment on Ekstrum because Ekstrum was not a member of the fire union. \n \n In his 28 years with Tucson Fire, Ekstrum had positive reviews and was given \"exceed standards\" on most of his evaluations. Williams said in his memo that Ekstrum's work ethic and performance had been exemplary and professional. \n \n In early 2010, Ekstrum used two weeks' vacation time to volunteer in Haiti and help the victims of the earthquake, according to his personnel file. \n \n He was only reprimanded once, an oral reprimand in 1984 for backing his vehicle into an object, Gulotta said. \n \n City Manager Mike Letcher said the department took the appropriate action over the Jan. 8 incident, but he is concerned his office didn't know about it until this week. \n \n On StarNet: Read more about the shooting and its aftermath at azstarnet.com/giffords \n \n Contact reporter Fernanda Echavarri at fechavarri@azstarnet.com or 573-4224.

    "document": "The figures that go into China\u2019s gross domestic product are \u201cman-made\u201d and \u201cfor reference only,\u201d Li Keqiang, then a regional Communist Party head, said in 2007. \n \n The comments by Li, now a vice premier who\u2019s expected to become premier next spring, were revealed in a diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks in late 2010. Li\u2019s remarks are especially relevant as China announced today that the economy expanded 7.6 percent last quarter from a year earlier, the slowest pace in three years. \n \n Investors, bankers and economists face a host of difficulties in interpreting the numbers from China\u2019s statistics bureau, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its July 16 issue. Combining all officially reported provincial GDP numbers for last year produces a total exceeding national GDP by about 10 percent, Ma Jiantang, head of the National Bureau of Statistics, said in February. Ma said that is due partly to double counting of items including factory production and that his bureau was trying to correct the issue. \n \n China\u2019s registered urban unemployment has moved between just under 4 percent and 4.3 percent for the last decade, while electricity consumption has slowed much faster than growth in official GDP when it normally should move more in tandem. That has stirred speculation GDP figures are being skewed upward in the run-up to a leadership transition this fall. \n \n \u2018Smoothed\u2019 Figures \n \n \u201cOut of the black box comes a number, and that number doesn\u2019t always line up with the other numbers,\u201d says Andrew Batson, Beijing-based research director at macroeconomics consultant GK Dragonomics. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the GDP numbers this year are smoothed.\u201d \n \n One legacy of the planned economy is that bureaucrats are given targets by the central government for everything from steel production to harvests and local GDP. These same officials traditionally have been promoted on their success in making their numbers. \n \n \u201cWe have a saying in China: The cadres produce the data, and data produces the cadres,\u201d said Jin Yongjin, a professor of statistics at Renmin University in Beijing. \n \n The government is good at measuring some pieces of the economy including industrial production and profits, said Louis Kuijs, an economist at the Fung Global Institute, a research group in Hong Kong. Those numbers benefit from a nationwide system of corporate reporting instituted decades ago to help central planners steer the economy. \n \n \u201cIn the old system it was crucial to have that reporting system in place,\u201d Kuijs said. \u201cChina\u2019s industrial survey is giving us quite good numbers.\u201d \n \n Service Economy \n \n The country\u2019s statistical system may be far less capable of measuring the service economy or getting an accurate reading of consumption by the middle class. \n \n \u201cIf you look at the number of cars produced in China, you will probably get a more or less accurate number,\u201d said Stephen Green, regional head of research for greater China at Standard Chartered Plc in Hong Kong. \u201cBut the system isn\u2019t good at measuring how many karaoke nights people have had or restaurant meals they have had.\u201d \n \n Retail sales include purchases by government offices and big state enterprises, Green said. That may explain why retail sales haven\u2019t fallen during downturns: State entities are ordered to keep buying even when individual consumption has probably declined. \n \n Equipment Sales \n \n Investment banks have searched for the indicator that will predict an economic turning point. Standard Chartered looked at sales of earth-moving equipment before deciding it was a lagging rather than a leading indicator. Bank loans, as well as electricity consumption and rail cargo volume, all cited by Li Keqiang as more reliable than GDP, are still a good proxy for the economy, Green said. \n \n Today\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics report showed China\u2019s growth slowed for a sixth consecutive quarter as trade and manufacturing decelerated. Last quarter\u2019s 7.6 percent growth rate compared with an 8.1 percent expansion in the previous period and the 7.7 percent forecast by economists. \n \n Electricity generation was unchanged in June from a year earlier at 393.4 billion kilowatt-hours, according to today\u2019s data. That\u2019s the first time since May 2009 that production hasn\u2019t increased, excluding a contraction in January this year as factories shut for the weeklong holiday. \n \n Data Collection \n \n One new effort to gauge the economy is the China Beige Book, a quarterly survey of about 2,000 bankers and company executives, modeled on the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s Beige Book. It measures growth in eight key industries across China\u2019s major regions, said Leland Miller, president of New York-based CBB International LLC, which publishes the report. \n \n Chinese policy makers are trying to address the government\u2019s statistical shortcomings. More data are now directly reported to Beijing, as opposed to being first filtered through local party offices. The statistics bureau has moved to standardize data collection by China\u2019s many ministries and industrial associations. \n \n The bureau has also worked with the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to improve its tracking of the economy. \n \n China still tends to treat its data gathering as a national secret, said Anne Stevenson-Yang, co-founder of Beijing-based J Capital Research, which analyzes equities. She cited the government\u2019s refusal to release the weighting of goods tracked to compile its consumer price inflation index. \n \n \u201cWhy would you ever lift the hood and show people how you do it?\u201d Stevenson-Yang said. \u201cThat only reduces your ability to change numbers if you need to.\u201d \n \n --Dexter Roberts. Editors: Christopher Power, Scott Lanman \n \n To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Dexter Roberts in Beijing at droberts34@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Christopher Power at cpower3@bloomberg.net ||||| China's growth has slowed to its lowest rate since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2009, though analysts voiced optimism on Friday that the economy may have bottomed out already. \n \n Second-quarter growth of 7.6% \u2013 down from 8.1% in the previous three months \u2013 was in line with expectations, but dampened hopes that the world's second largest economy would help to offset wider woes. \n \n \"The growth rate of 7.6% is already an achievement because the economic situation facing China has been complex and severe,\" said Sheng Laiyun of the National Bureau of Statistics. \n \n \"We have seen tepid domestic and external demand.\" \n \n Growth in the first half of the year stood at 7.8% overall, with Europe's struggles and government curbs on the property market weighing on the economy. The Asian Development Bank trimmed its forecast for the year from 8.5% to 8.2% on Thursday \u2013 echoing the World Bank's move in May. \n \n The Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, warned last week that the economy \"still faces relatively huge downward pressure\". Lower than expected consumer inflation and import growth, in addition to producer price deflation, have also unnerved investors. \n \n Xianfang Ren, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Beijing, told Reuters: \"Overall, this is a soft landing, but we can see that the Chinese economy is undergoing serious pain. \n \n \"I have 80% confidence that the economy will pick up in the third quarter as we have been in a slowdown for six consecutive quarters now.\" \n \n Xiao Li, an economist at Industrial Bank in Shanghai, told AP: \"It is not certain whether or not there will be a strong upward rebound. But at least the economic growth rate will stop coming down.\" \n \n Sheng said the slowdown partly reflected China's shift to a more sustainable development pattern after years of double-digit growth. The government has set its target for GDP growth this year \u2013 which rarely bears much resemblance to the actual figure \u2013 at just 7.5%, after years of an 8% goal. \n \n \"The downside risks remain, but the government has plenty of tools in its hands to make sure it won't collapse. The issue is whether the government can adjust to steady and healthy growth in the medium term,\" said Qian Liu of the Economist Intelligence Unit. \n \n \"Obviously in the last few months, things have been slower than anyone wanted or expected \u2013 they succeeded in scaring people out of buying houses so the residential property sector fell; and they frightened local officials and bankers in terms of infrastructure.

Analysts expect further easing of monetary policy, but officials have insisted they will not launch a stimulus package comparable to the 4tn yuan (\u00a3405bn) package of 2008. \n \n Retail sales growth in June fell to 12.1% from 13.8% the previous month, while growth in factory output ebbed slightly from 9.6% to 9.5%. \n \n Fixed asset investment growth \u2013 the key driver of economic expansion over the last decade \u2013 was 20.4% in the year to June, slightly above expectations, with a sharp acceleration in the last month. \n \n The government has long vowed to rebalance the economy away from its reliance on investment and exports towards domestic consumption, but experts say progress is proving painfully slow. \n \n Wen told economists this week: \"The measures to stabilise economic growth include boosting consumption and diversifying exports, but currently, what is important is to pursue a reasonable growth of investment.\"",

    "document": "Donald Trump. Win McNamee/Getty Images \n \n Hours after British Prime Minister Theresa May announced the UK will expel 23 Russian diplomats as punishment over the nerve agent attack against a former spy on British soil, President Donald Trump has yet to weigh in. \n \n \"This will be the single biggest expulsion for over thirty years and it reflects the fact that this is not the first time that the Russian State has acted against our country,\" May said. \"For those who wish to do us harm, my message is clear. You are not welcome here.\" \n \n May also said that Russians under suspicious would have their assets frozen, and that the British Royal Family and government ministers would not attend the 2018 World Cup in Russia. \n \n Meanwhile, Trump's silence on the matter since he briefly acknowledged the chemical attack Tuesday has been deafening to former US diplomats, many of whom wonder why the US hasn't been steadfast since the beginning in backing its closest international ally on the matter. \n \n May announced Monday that it was \"highly likely\" the Russian government ordered an assassination attempt against Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer who later became a double agent for the UK, in Salisbury, England earlier this month. \n \n Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, were both hospitalized and remain in critical condition after being exposed to Novichok, a nerve agent developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. \n \n Shortly after May said Russia was the likely culprit in Skripal's case, the White House called the attack \"reckless, indiscriminate, and irresponsible\" but declined to specifically name Russia, saying the details still needed to be sorted out. That evening, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson took a more hardline stance, saying Russia was \"clearly\" behind the attack. Tuesday morning, Trump fired Tillerson via Twitter. \n \n While answering questions about Tillerson's firing, Trump said of the chemical attack on Skripal, \"As soon as we get the facts straight, if we agree with them, we will condemn Russia or whoever it may be.\" Referring to the UK's findings, he added, \"It sounds to me like they believe it was Russia, and I would certainly take that finding as fact.\" \n \n On Wednesday, after May announced the expulsion of the 23 Russian diplomats \u2014 the largest number ejected by the UK since the Cold War \u2014multiple US officials, including the US ambassador to the UN and White House staff, said the US stands in solidarity with the UK. \n \n However, the president himself has not come out and publicly made that clear since his brief mention on Tuesday. \n \n 'Judgment day for Donald Trump' \n \n President Donald Trump and Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May react during a ceremony at the new NATO headquarters before the start of a summit in Brussels, Belgium, May 25, 2017. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann \n \n \"Judgment day for Donald Trump,\" R. Nicholas Burns, a former US ambassador to NATO, tweeted after the UK announced the measures it was taking to penalize Russia. \"Will he support Britain unequivocally on the nerve agent attack? Back #NATO sanctions? Finally criticize Putin? Act like a leader of the West? \n \n Richard Kauzlarich, the former deputy assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of European Affairs, said the White House should have backed the British from the beginning. \n \n \"When you have the British come out as clearly and decisively as they did about who was responsible, the logic and gravity of the situation would require the president to say something in solidarity,\" he said. \n \n \"It should be almost automatic, especially with an ally this close to the US.\" \n \n Edward Price, the former senior director of the National Security Council under President Barack Obama, echoed that view. \n \n \"For years, we heard from voices on the political right that America couldn't possibly confront its adversaries without first clearly naming them,\" he said. \"And [on Monday], we heard the White House Press Secretary condemn the act but very deliberately skirt the actor, which, by all accounts, appears to be Moscow in this case.\" \n \n He added that not only did the US effectively hang the UK \"out to dry\" by not staying in lockstep with the ally from the start, it was also signaling to Russian President Vladimir Putin that \"he is free to act with impunity, including by carrying out deadly acts in the UK.\" \n \n The Skripal attack is perhaps the most high-profile case of its kind since former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko, a vocal Putin critic, was murdered in the UK in November 2006. A public inquiry into Litvinenko's death found in 2016 that Russian intelligence officials were responsible for the assassination, and that Putin was \"probably\" behind it. \n \n Moscow scoffed at the UK's latest accusations linking it to the Skripals' attempted assassination, dismissing them as a \"circus show.\" After the UK announced the expulsion of nearly two dozen Russian diplomats on Wednesday, Russia called it a \"very serious provocation\" and a \"hostile action.\" \n \n Meanwhile, Trump's silence since May's remarks on Wednesday morning mark yet another incident in which the president, \"for whatever reason, is not prepared to put Russia on the spot,\" Kauzlarich said. \"And Russia will draw the conclusion that anybody would: that if this president, for reasons no one can understand, will not criticize Russia on something this blatant, what will it take?\" \n \n \"All of us who have been around the block find it bizarre that we would not be 100% behind the Brits on this,\" he added. \"They've earned it. Russia hasn't.\" ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Daniel Arkin \n \n U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Wednesday the United States believes Russia is responsible for the attempted assassination of a former Russian double agent and his daughter in Britain \u2014 and the U.N. Security Council should hold the Kremlin \"accountable.\" \n \n \"The United States believes that Russia is responsible for the attack on two people in the United Kingdom using a military-grade nerve agent,\" Haley said at a Security Council meeting in New York. \n \n Haley said the United States stood in \"absolute solidarity\" with Britain after the country expelled 23 Russian diplomats in response to the chemical attack last week on the ex-spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter, Yulia. \n \n Related: U.K. to expel 23 diplomats in retaliation for spy poisoning \n \n She called on the U.N. to take action action, saying that the \"credibility of this Council will not survive if we fail to hold Russia accountable.\" \n \n \"If we don't take immediate, concrete measures to address this now, Salisbury will not be the last place we see chemical weapons used,\" Haley said, referring to the English city where Skripal and his daughter were discovered unconscious on a bench. \n \n Russia has denied any involvement in the assassination attempt. \n \n Haley's remarks echoed those of Rex Tillerson, the ousted secretary of state who this week called the nerve agent attack \"a really egregious act\" that appears to have \"clearly\" come from Russia. \n \n President Donald Trump, for his part, has not pinned the blame on the Kremlin, saying this week that \"as soon as we get the facts straight,\" the United States would \"condemn Russia or whoever it may be.\" \n \n British Prime Minister Theresa May, however, has blasted Russia in the wake of the March 4 attack, saying it was \"highly likely\" that the government of Vladimir Putin was responsible. \n \n \"There is no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian State was culpable for the attempted murder of Mr. Skripal and his daughter \u2014 and for threatening the lives of other British citizens in Salisbury,\" May said on Wednesday. \n \n Related: How can U.K. respond to Russia-linked spy attack? \n \n Britain moved to expel the Russia diplomats on Wednesday after Moscow ignored a midnight deadline to explain how its nerve weapon was used in the attack. The expulsions \u2014 the largest in three decades \u2014 \"will fundamentally degrade Russian intelligence capabilities in the U.K. for years to come,\" May said. \n \n Skripal, the 66-year-old ex-spy targeted with the nerve agent, is a former Russian military officer who was sentenced to 13 years in prison after being convicted in 2006 of spying for Britain. He passed the identity of dozens of spies to the U.K.'s foreign intelligence agency, according to news reports. \n \n He was freed in 2010 as part of a U.S.-Russian spy swap that also included spy Anna Chapman, who was arrested in New York earlier that year. ||||| (CNN) US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said Wednesday the Trump administration \"stands in absolute solidarity with Great Britain\" following a nerve agent attack against a Russian double agent and his daughter in the English city of Salisbury last week. \n \n In the strongest statement yet from the US administration on the affair, Haley said Washington shared the UK's assessment that the Russian state was behind the poisoning and demanded a firm international response. \n \n \"The United States believes that Russia is responsible for the attack on two people in the United Kingdom using a military-grade nerve agent,\" Haley said in her remarks at a UN Security Council emergency session, blasting the Russian government for flouting international law. \n \n \"If we don't take immediate concrete measures to address this now, Salisbury will not be the last place we see chemical weapons used,\" said Haley. \"They could be used here in New York or in cities of any country that sits on this council.\" \n \n The United Kingdom believes Russia was behind the attempted murders of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia because the nerve agent used, Novichok , was developed in the Soviet Union and could not be replicated by non-state actors. London announced Wednesday it would expel 23 Russian diplomats after Moscow failed to meet a UK deadline to give a \"credible response.\" \n \n Russia has dismissed the accusations as \"fairy tales\" and denied any involvement in the attack which landed the Skripals, along with a British police officer, in the hospital. \n \n Moscow's ambassador to the UN, Vassily Nebenzia, even suggested the UK might have been responsible for the attack in an attempt to smear Russia. \"In the Russian Federation, no scientific research or development work under the title Novichok were carried out,\" he told the Security Council. \n \n \"The most probable source origin this chemical are the countries which have since the end of the 90s been carrying... out intensive research on these kinds of weapons, including the UK.\" \n \n But Haley laid the blame firmly at Russia's door. Highlighting Moscow's support of the Assad regime in Syria following that government's use of chemical weapons against civilians, Haley told fellow diplomats the world had reached \"a defining moment.\" \n \n \"Time and time again, members states say they oppose the use of chemical weapons under any circumstance,\" said Haley. \"Now one member stands accused of using chemical weapons on the sovereign soil of another member. The credibility of this council will not survive if we fail to hold Russia accountable.\" \n \n Presenting Britain's case, Deputy UK Ambassador to the UN Jonathan Allen called the attack \"an unlawful use of force\" and invited representatives from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to conduct an independent investigation of the incident. \n \n Nebenzia, Russia's envoy, reaffirmed his government's denial of involvement in a lengthy and colorful response. \n \n He called on the UK government to offer proof that Novichok was used and that Russia was responsible, and slammed UK Prime Minister Theresa May for making \"completely irresponsible statements\" and \"threats.\" \n \n In questioning London's allegations, Nebenzia cited the English fictional detective Sherlock Holmes and his \"hapless\" Scotland Yard counterpart, Inspector Lestrade. \n \n \"Lestrade latches on to something that is on the surface of a crime and is in a hurry to provide banal conclusions only to be overturned by Sherlock Holmes, who always finds what is behind the crime,\" Nebenzia said. \"I do think we could all stand to benefit from having a Sherlock Holmes with us today.\" \n \n With apparent sarcasm, Nebenzia also suggested the UK government should look inward to determine why Russian nationals in the country so often find themselves in mortal peril, and mocked Haley's credibility as \"an experienced chemist.\" \n \n The White House later backed up Haley's comments at the UN, saying it shared the British assessment of Russia's culpability in the Salisbury attack. \"The United States stands in solidarity with its closest ally, the United Kingdom,\" the statement read. \n \n \"This latest action by Russia fits into a pattern of behavior in which Russia disregards the international rules-based order, undermines the sovereignty and security of countries worldwide, and attempts to subvert and discredit Western democratic institutions and processes.\"",

    "document": "As the ruinous force of Sandy begins to diminish, the nominal pause it created in the presidential election campaign is about to fade away. \n \n President Barack Obama continued his detour from the campaign trail Tuesday to focus on storm response. Republican Mitt Romney set aside a planned political rally in favor of a relief event to help storm victims. Both asked supporters to make donations to the Red Cross. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Agence France-Presse/Getty Images Mitt Romney helped unload supplies for storm relief in Kettering, Ohio, Tuesday. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Pool/Getty Images Barack Obama spoke at Red Cross headquarters in Washington. \n \n But a presidential campaign racing toward its conclusion next week is taking little more than a short break to acknowledge the storm's impact. \n \n Even as Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama canceled political appearances Tuesday, the two campaigns escalated a heated exchange over Mr. Romney's suggestion that the president's auto bailout had benefited China, rather than U.S. autoworkers. With new TV ad buys, Mr. Romney and his allies also pushed to enlarge the set of competitive states to include Pennsylvania, long an elusive prize for the Republican nominees. \n \n Mr. Romney will return to his schedule of campaign appearances Wednesday in hopes of regaining the momentum many polls showed he had built in recent weeks. Mr. Obama is scheduled to follow suit on Thursday, after more time in Washington and a tour of storm damage in New Jersey, as he juggles the political rewards and risks of focusing on the government disaster response. \n \n Northeast states grappled with how to make sure voting next week isn't unduly affected by the storm. With widespread power outages, flooding and blocked roads, officials said they may have to move or consolidate some polling locations. Connecticut gave voters two extra days to register while Maryland said it may have to resort to paper ballots for some locations due to power outages, which could delay the vote count. \n \n For Mr. Obama, the turn to disaster management paid a surprising political dividend when he won praise on Tuesday from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican who has been a scathing critic of his presidency. \n \n \"The president has been great,\" Mr. Christie, who represents Mr. Romney at campaign events, said on MSNBC. \"The president has been all over this and he deserves great credit.\" It was one of several television interviews in which Mr. Christie praised Mr. Obama, who will tour New Jersey storm damage Wednesday with the governor. \n \n The risk for Mr. Obama is that every day he is in Washington he isn't traveling the country for campaign rallies like one in Ohio last week, when the presidential plane landed in front of thousands of ecstatic supporters. \n \n \"The president's No. 1 asset of Air Force One has now been grounded,\" said Scott Reed, manager of Republican Bob Dole's 1996 presidential bid. Mr. Obama's campaign uses such events to push supporters to take advantage of early voting. \n \n Even before Mr. Romney announced he would resume campaigning Wednesday with three events in Florida, he managed to stay in the public eye in the battleground state of Ohio. He turned a planned political rally in Dayton into a relief event for storm victims. \n \n As Mr. Romney maintained a reserved public posture, his campaign proceeded with partisan drive. The campaign's first new campaign commercial in Pennsylvania, part of a bid to expand the map of competitive battlegrounds, says the president's policies led 22 coal-fired power plants to close or be converted to another form of fuel. \n \n Obama campaign spokesman Michael Czin responded that the ad \"distorts the president's record and reeks of desperation. Under President Obama's leadership, employment in coal mining hit a 15-year high in 2011 while he's making historic investments in clean coal research and development.\" \n \n Romney advisers hailed the last-minute advertising push as further evidence the president's support is eroding in unexpected places. Because 96% of Pennsylvania voters cast their ballots on Election Day, rather than through absentee or early voting, Republicans have hinted for months that the state was a prime target for a late push. \n \n \"This expansion of the electoral map demonstrates that Gov. Romney's momentum has jumped containment from the usual target states and has spread to deeper blue states that Chicago never anticipated defending,\" Romney political director Rich Beeson wrote in a memo widely circulated on Tuesday. \n \n Mr. Romney's campaign would not say how much money it had budgeted for Pennsylvania, and it was still in the process of buying airtime Tuesday afternoon. \n \n The Romney campaign and its outside allies are spending at least $4.5 million in Pennsylvania this week, according to operatives tracking the 2012 race. \n \n The Romney allies are also buying airtime in attempts to expand the list of competitive states, spending nearly $2 million in Michigan and roughly $900,000 in Minnesota. \n \n Mr. Obama's campaign is responding in Pennsylvania, and by Tuesday afternoon had bought at least $650,000 in airtime through Election Day, as well as $290,000 in Minnesota, according to political strategists tracking the spending. The campaign also plans to match Republican advertising in Michigan, an Obama aide said. \n \n Obama campaign manager Jim Messina dismissed the Pennsylvania ad buy as a \"desperate play\" by a campaign still looking for a path to the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win. The president is holding a lead of roughly five percentage points in the state, according to an average of public-opinion surveys compiled by Real Clear Politics. And Mr. Romney has spent very little time in the state. \n \n \"Let's be very clear: The Romney campaign and its allies decision to go up with advertising in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Minnesota is a decision made out of weakness, not strength,\" Mr. Messina said. \n \n Not even the emergence of unexpected battlegrounds could distract from the importance of the nine swing states that have been the focal point of this election since early last year, particularly Ohio. \n \n The two campaigns sparred Tuesday over a TV ad the Romney camp aired in Ohio suggesting the president's auto bailout paved the way for Chrysler Group LLC, one of the beneficiaries of that federal intervention, to build Jeeps in China. \n \n The Obama campaign called the ad misleading, releasing its own spot to push back on this latest attack. \n \n Chrysler borrowed about $10.5 billion from the U.S. as part of its 2009 bankruptcy restructuring. In May 2011, the \"new Chrysler,\" controlled by Fiat, repaid the last $7.1 billion it owed the government. But the U.S. Treasury department has said it is unlikely to fully recover the roughly $1.3 billion it is owed by the \"old Chrysler.\" \n \n In a blog post on Oct. 25, Chrysler's chief spokesman, Gualberto Ranieri, called Mr. Romney's claim a \"leap that would be difficult even for professional circus acrobats.\" \n \n Sergio Marchionne, chief executive of the Fiat/Chrysler Group, waded into the controversy on Tuesday, emailing company employees to reassure them that production of Jeep sport utility vehicles won't be moved to China. Instead, he said the company will be expanding Jeep production in the U.S., while looking to produce cars in China to be sold in that market. \n \n \"Jeep assembly lines will remain in operation in the United States and will constitute the backbone of the brand,\" Mr. Marchionne wrote. \"It is inaccurate to suggest anything different.\" \n \n The Romney campaign ignored the Obama campaign's criticism over its initial TV spot, airing a new radio ad that says Chrysler \"plans to start making Jeeps in, you guessed it, China.\" \n \n \"Barack Obama says he saved the auto industry,'' the radio ad says. \"But for who? Ohio or China?\" \n \n Mr. Obama canceled campaign events Wednesday in Ohio. He hasn't made a campaign appearance since Sunday. In remarks at a Red Cross relief center Tuesday, he said his message to federal relief officials is: \"No bureaucracy, no red tape, get resources to where they need to be as fast as possible.\" \n \n Obama aides say that there is a downside to staying off the campaign trail with so few days remaining before Election Day. But they view the pause in campaigning as more harmful to Mr. Romney, who they say is having trouble promoting his message as the nation focuses on the storm. \n \n Mr. Obama is planning a campaign blitz in the final days, starting with scheduled campaign events Thursday in Nevada, Colorado and Ohio. On Friday he is scheduled to spend the entire day in Ohio. In supervising disaster response, Mr. Obama reinforced a campaign theme that the government plays a crucial role, and disaster relief is one of the few that enjoy bipartisan support. \n \n \"It is a welcome counterpoint to a campaign that has been anything but elevated and, on the president's side, has been devoted at least as much to making the case against Romney as making the case for himself,'' said William Galston, a political analyst who was a domestic policy aide to President Bill Clinton. \n \n \u2014Sara Murray, Carol E.

The White House made sure to update reporters early Tuesday morning with the president\u2019s work on response efforts to Sandy \u2014 including his endeavors overnight \u2014 and released photos of Obama meeting with federal officials.

In fact, of all of President Donald Trump's campaign workers, Caputo might be the one with the deepest links to Russia: He lived in Moscow for several years in the 1990s, claims to have worked for the Kremlin and continues to try to do business there. \n \n A colorful public relations specialist and fill-in radio talk-show host in Buffalo, New York, Caputo agreed to testify behind closed doors, at the insistence of the Republican and Democratic committee leaders. But he said he wanted his story -- his denial of wrongdoing -- to be made public. \n \n \"I heard nothing of the kind,\" Caputo said, when asked if he ever heard anyone inside the campaign discuss Russian assistance. US intelligence agencies have determined that Russia interfered with the election in order to help Trump win. \"In fact, we were so busy just trying to keep up with the sun rising and setting on that campaign that I can't imagine anyone had the time, nor the wherewithal to go out there and even do something like this. \n \n \"Anybody who covered the Trump effort knew this was a pell-mell operation from the moment he woke up in the morning until the moment he went to bed,\" he said. \"The idea that somebody at that campaign would have had the forethought and the treachery ... or the resources to go out and do this is laughable.\" \n \n Still loyal to Trump \n \n Caputo talked to CNN on Monday, the day before Donald Trump Jr. released emails that raised further questions about potential collusion between his father's campaign and the Russian government. According to the emails, Trump's eldest son agreed to meet with a woman described as a \"Russian government lawyer\" because he was told she had damaging information on Clinton. Jared Kushner, the President's son-in-law and now a senior White House adviser, and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended the meeting on June 9, 2016. \n \n Less than two weeks later, on June 20, Caputo resigned from the campaign after celebrating the dismissal of campaign manager Corey Lewandowski with a tweet that said, \"Ding Dong the witch is dead.\" Manafort, who brought Caputo into the national campaign in April 2016 after his success with the New York primary, replaced Lewandowski as chairman. \n \n Ding dong the witch is dead! https://t.co/pSqQwmAGz1 pic.twitter.com/5dE7GMeEK6 \u2014 That Michael Caputo (@MichaelRCaputo) June 20, 2016 \n \n Still loyal to the President, Caputo defended Trump Jr. \n \n \"You try to find ways to trip up your opponent. And if somebody comes to you and says, 'I've got, you know, the smoking gun on the ... Clinton campaign,' you have that meeting. You definitely have that meeting. ... If that lawyer had contacted me, I would have recommended she meet with somebody else, but I would have passed it up the chain of command.\" \n \n Caputo's relationship to Russia \n \n Caputo's history in Russia dates to 1994, when he says the US government sent him there to help the country's young government design election laws. \n \n \"I was sent there by the Clinton administration to meddle in their elections,\" he said, flippantly using language that alludes to the current controversy. \n \n Caputo was forced to resign in 1995 when he bucked the State Department by defending the Russian Election Commission's decision to disqualify a progressive party from an election, according to a Washington Post story at the time. \n \n After losing his job, Caputo opened a public relations firm in Moscow to help Western companies do business there. He also married a Russian woman (whom he later divorced), helped create a program similar to America's \"Rock the Vote\" and advised then-President Boris Yeltsin on his re-election campaign. He moved back to the US in 2000 after the Russian economy collapsed and Vladimir Putin was elected president. \n \n \"And ever since then, I've been involved in the former Soviet Union, and I'm not going to stop now,\" Caputo told CNN. \n \n Russian links criticized \n \n Caputo is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Roger Stone , a Trump adviser who has also agreed to be interviewed by the House intelligence committee. \n \n Caputo's name arose as part of the investigation in March, when Rep. Jackie Speier, a committee member and Democrat from California, said he was part of a \"tarantula web\" of links to Russia. Speier referred to Caputo as \"Putin's image consultant,\" an apparent reference to work he did for Gazprom Media, a subsidiary of the Russian state-owned energy company that took over an independent TV station in 2001. When pro-democracy groups blasted Putin and his government for violating press freedoms, Caputo was brought in to help smooth things over. \n \n \"I'm not proud of the work today,\" Caputo told The Buffalo News in March 2016. \"But at the time, Putin wasn't such a bad guy.\" \n \n In the CNN interview, Caputo denied that he worked to improve Putin's image. \n \n \"No. That's absolutely false,\" he said, criticizing Speier's office for faulty research. \"I didn't work on Putin's image. I was trying to help Gazprom Media explain why they took over NTV, a television network. If that somehow down the line helped the Kremlin, that wasn't what I was hired for.\" \n \n Caputo said he came across Putin twice in the late 1990s, when the future Russian leader was deputy mayor of St. Petersburg, but that the two never had a conversation. He said he didn't realize Putin had been at a reception in Caputo's Moscow home until he saw photos afterward. \n \n Over the years, Caputo has continued to do business with Russians, starting with \"business leaders and oligarchs who were trying to come to the United States.\" In 2004, however, he wrote a column in The Washington Post in which he referred to the oligarchs as \"brutal billionaires.\" Facing death threats, he bought a tugboat and a gun and lived at sea -- with a white parrot -- for most of five years. \n \n Caputo took a break from the boat in 2007 to consult on a parliamentary campaign in Ukraine, where he met his second wife. He has been particularly critical of Putin for Russia's invasion of Crimea in 2014. \n \n Working with 'both the White House and the Kremlin' \n \n In 2015, he re-established an old partnership with Sergey \"George\" Petrushin, founder of the Zeppelin nightclub in Moscow. Their PR agency has offices in New York, Miami and Moscow. \n \n The firm's website claims that Caputo is \"the only executive in history who has worked for both the White House and the Kremlin,\" a statement that Caputo acknowledged Thursday is not entirely true. In response to a CNN question, Caputo said he worked for then-President George H.W. Bush's losing re-election campaign in 1992, but never for the White House. \"I worked on the campaign, not in the building,\" he said in a text message. \"Spent a lot of time in the White House and on the road with the President (Bush) but not WH staff.\" \n \n Caputo, who first met Trump in 1988, said he never thought the New York businessman could become president. He said he still supports Trump, and downplayed the ongoing investigations by Senate and House committees and a special counsel -- what he calls the \"Russia collusion delusion\" -- as a \"Democratic strategy\" to block the President's agenda. \n \n \"I've had a couple of very significantly in-depth discussions with Donald Trump about America and about patriotism and about the gifts this country has given him,\" Caputo said. \"And he is not the kind of person who would ever do anything like this.\" \n \n The testimony \n \n After testifying for three and a half hours before the House intelligence committee Friday -- an hour and a half longer than expected -- Caputo told reporters that in the hearing he denied having knowledge of any alleged contacts between the campaign and Russia. \n \n \"I spent my time in front of the committee detailing the fact that I had no contact with Russians, that I never heard of anyone with the Trump campaign talking with Russians, that I was never asked questions about my time in Russia, that I never even spoke to anyone about Russia, that I never heard the word 'Russia,' and we did not use Russian dressing,\" Caputo told reporters in a press conference after the closed-door testimony. \"There was absolutely no discussion of Russia on the Trump campaign 'til the day I left.\" \n \n Florida Republican Tom Rooney, California Democrat Adam Schiff, California Democrat Eric Swalwell and Washington Democrat Denny Heck attended, Caputo's lawyer, Dennis Vacco, said. \n \n Heck told CNN's Jim Acosta shortly after the hearing that it was \"probably the most fascinating three hours of time I've spent in my nearly five years in the United States House of Representatives.\"",

Col. Karl Borjes, a RDECOM science adviser, said in the U.S. Army statement. \"It's advanced armor. It's communications, antennas. It's cognitive performance. It's sensors, miniature-type circuits. That's all going to fit in here, too.\" \n \n Not everyone, however, is enamored with the super-advanced gizmos being proposed for the soldiers of tomorrow. \"My sense is it is an up-armored Pinocchio,\" Scott Neil, a retired special forces master sergeant and Silver Star recipient, told the Tampa Tribune. \"Now the commander can shove a monkey in a suit and ask us to survive a machine gun, IED [improvised explosive device] and poor intelligence all on the same objective. And when you die in it, as it melds to your body, you can bury them in it.\" \n \n Even believers in the TALOS suit acknowledge its limitations. \"The acronym TALOS was chosen deliberately,\" McKinley said. \"It's the name of the bronze armored giant from 'Jason and the Argonauts.' Like all good superheroes, Talos has one weakness. For the Army's TALOS, the weak spot is either the need to carry around a heavy pump for a hydraulic system, or lots of heavy batteries. We don't have Iron Man's power source yet.\" \n \n For would-be sci-fi superheroes who are ready for their very own TALOS, the wait may prove excruciating: Though various components of the suit are currently in development, the Army hopes to have a prototype ready next year, and an advanced model won't be developed until at least two years after that. \n \n Follow Marc Lallanilla on Twitter and Google+.

Bill McRaven, who unveiled the idea at a conference in May, says it was inspired by the death of one of his troops in Afghanistan. \n \n \"One of our folks going through the door was killed by the Taliban on the other side in an attempt to rescue a hostage,\" McRaven, the command's top officer, says. \n \n So McRaven challenged those at the conference to come up with better body armor. And he posed this question: \"Why haven't we put effort into ensuring particularly that guy going through the door ... is protected to the maximum capability that we can provide him, as a nation?\" \n \n That effort is now underway. The Special Operations Command held something of a science fair last month in Tampa, says Jim Geurts, who buys high-tech equipment for the command. At the conference, dozens of technologies were shown off, he says, including \"advanced body armor, advance power supply, practical exoskeletons ... [and] different display technologies.\" \n \n It's all just a concept now, Geurts says. But it's a concept with a name: TALOS, short for tactical assault light operator suit. It will take a year to even select which technologies to use. \n \n \"We're not at the Iron Man flying suit, you know, flying at 50,000 feet level,\" he says. \n \n So, a flying suit is not part of the plan. But the first challenge is to come up with stronger body armor so a commando can survive once he kicks in a door. \n \n Norman Wagner, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Delaware, is working the problem. He's looking to nanotechnology to create a solution that contains particles smaller than a single red blood cell. \n \n \"We're starting with the material that's almost a liquid ceramic,\" he says. \n \n A liquid that can be dipped in Kevlar fabric \u2014 the current building block of body armor and helmets \u2014 and make it even tougher, literally the moment a bullet strikes. \n \n \"It transitions when you hit it hard,\" Wagner says. \"These particles organize themselves quickly, locally in a way that they can't flow anymore and they become like a solid.\" \n \n So a liquid becomes a solid to make better armor protection. But the military wants to do more. It wants to make the soldier faster and stronger. \n \n Gareth McKinley, a professor at MIT, works on liquid armor, among other things. He says the suit could include attachable frames on the arms and legs that use hydraulics to greatly increase strength and speed. \n \n \"They typically consist of an external skeleton that's attached or bolted onto the human's either upper torso or lower torso,\" McKinley says. \n \n Sounds a bit like Iron Man, doesn't it? \n \n \"It sounds exactly like Iron Man,\" McKinley says. \"The other kind of things that you see in the movies I think that would be more realistic at the moment would be the kind of external suit that Sigourney Weaver wears in Aliens, where it's a large robot that amplifies the motions and lifting capability of a human.\" \n \n Another function: The commandos need a more complete picture of the battlefield. \n \n So, the suit will likely include a wearable computer, like Google Glass, says Geurts of the Special Operations Command. Instead of a handheld display, commandos could simply look into the corner of their glasses and get updates on things like the location of enemy forces. \n \n But, Geurts cautions people not to expect any of this anytime soon, \n \n \"The hope is that we would have some working full-up prototypes in the two- to three-year time frame,\" he says. \n \n In the meantime, that kind of suit can only be seen at a theater near you.",

    "document": "Carrie Underwood and Stephen Moyer toplined the three-hour NBC production, which featured a cavernous set and familiar songs. \n \n It's easy to remember a musical for its songs. That is, after all, what makes a musical different from every other kind of narrative: The characters will shout to the rafters in full throat, revealing things they just can't speak, because the music gives them leave to lay themselves bare. \n \n And the songs in The Sound of Music are sublime. Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II knew their way around a tune and these numbers -- from \"My Favorite Things\" to \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\" to the indefatigable \"Do-Re-Mi\" -- have endured since the Broadway production bowed in 1959 for good reason. But the story lives in the hearts of audiences because of Robert Wise's 1965 film adaptation starring Julie Andrews as Maria, the would-be nun trying to quench her yearning heart, and Christopher Plummer as Captain Von Trapp, the stoic Austrian unwilling to reignite his. Andrews' undeniable empathy and Plummer's prickly sensuality sold that love story to a generation, who've since passed it down to every other. \n \n RELATED: 'Sound of Music' Live: The Best Twitter Reactions \n \n With their live adaptation of the Broadway musical, NBC took a big swing for the fences. They spent a reported $9 million on the production and its cavernous set, which had to house the Austrian countryside, the interior of the Nonnberg Abbey, the Von Trapp estate and the arena where the Von Trapp Family Singers stage their final performance (draped in probably one too many Nazi flags). They engaged Craig Zadan and Neil Meron -- of NBC's calamitous Smash -- to produce. They got Audra McDonald to bring her pipes. They found a clutch of children who didn't have (too much) of that child-performer pomp. And they got Carrie Underwood and Stephen Moyer to play the lovers. And, well, whoops. \n \n Because while Underwood can deliver the songs -- I'm sure that anyone with the desire to plunge themselves into the American Idol ringer has been singing those songs for most of her life -- she doesn't acquit herself so well when it comes to carrying the emotional weight of the production. And perhaps it was unfair to ask so much of Underwood, to have to make Maria's journey in three scant hours -- whereas Andrews had weeks of production -- while enduring costume changes and remembering choreography and trying not to look at the prompter and not step on anyone's lines or feet. Underwood nails the look of a virginal almost-nun, but goes no deeper than that. Blank stares and placid smiles. \n \n STORY: 'Sound of Music' Live: 5 Standout Moments \n \n Moyer is a better singer than Russell Crowe, I'll give him that. But he's no Hugh Jackman. Or Neil Patrick Harris. Or Taye Diggs. Or even Nathan Fillion. His attempt at conveying an emotional hollowness just reads as mild constipation, his furrowed eyes and pursed lips doing all the work. He doesn't look stoic, he just looks clenched. \n \n The production itself came off without a hitch -- no easy feat with so many moving parts and opportunities for blown lines or stumble down staircases (oh, how I wished for a staircase stumble to lighten the three hours). The supporting cast was strong: Laura Benanti was appropriately sultry as Elsa Von Hottie, while Christian Borle was appropriately hammy as Max Detweiler and someone should find a way to have McDonald sing audiences into every commercial break. And while the camerawork -- by directors Rob Ashford and Beth McCarthy-Miller (who directed 30 Rock's live episodes) -- made everything still feel a little stagebound, the storytelling was clear. \n \n And yet, without Underwood and Moyer selling us on this legendary love story, The Sound of Music Live plays like very expensive karaoke. ||||| Joining all the other things to make one's spirits sink at this time of year \u2013 dark mornings, low temperatures, Susan Boyle's inevitable Christmas album \u2013 is Thursday night's live NBC production of the Sound of Music starring Carrie Underwood. In Times Square, there's a huge poster of her in Austrian drag, teeth blazing like strip lighting, a look on her face that seems to say, \"Hey! Come join me in the casual destruction of a staple of the American songbook!\" As if that corner of New York couldn't get more depressing. \n \n Well, kind of. As we know in our hearts \u2013 come on, dig deep \u2013 the Sound of Music is basically terrible: too long, too pious, too laboured in its point-making. Julie Andrews rescued the movie with a sort of weapons-grade gladness , her performance turning on that rare ability to present risible material with absolute conviction. Underwood will, no doubt, sell it for all that she's worth, but there are certain things one doesn't look to winners of American Idol to deliver and guilelessness is one of them. \n \n Neither is acting. Being in a musical isn't just a singing job, which is how Christopher Plummer, a veteran stage actor who started his career in productions of Ibsen, Shakespeare and Euripides, found himself cast as Captain von Trapp, something he has grumbled about ever since. He called it the \"Sound of Mucus\" and delivered his lines in a tone so sardonic, only Andrews' superior fire power could neutralize them. The clash of her absolute sincerity with his sly knowing style is part of what converted the show into kitsch, wherein lies its real worth. \n \n The other part, of course, is the songs, so slick and convincing that large numbers of people still think Edelweiss is the Austrian national anthem. Poor Austrians. (Up to a point). I went on the native-baiting Sound of Music tour in Salzburg, once, and watched as the baffled and mildly hostile locals strained to look away as hordes of British, American and Australian visitors trudged around town, re-enacting key scenes from the film while screaming. \n \n This kind of fanaticism is inspired as much by indoctrination as by any real value in the show. For most of us, repeated forced viewing since childhood has made the Sound of Music as familiar as a comfort blanket, a constant against which to measure our own progress. As I get older, for example, I find myself increasingly sympathising with the Baroness. Who hasn't been there? Labouring to impress in a power suit when the guy's undeclared taste is for novitiates? \n \n Part of the comfort of the show is its naked didacticism: the nuns' moral surety; the lessons in European history. Who can resist Liesl's executive summary of Lebensraum: \n \n Some people think we ought to be German. They're very mad at those who don't think so. \n \n Or the mythology that now surrounds the production? That day in Salzburg, our tour guide, who had been doing the tour twice-daily for eight years, presented the material with the detachment of one who has long ago retreated to a place where no one can reach her. Until a few years ago, she explained, you could go inside the actual gazebo where Liesl and Rolf frolicked, until an 80-year-old woman jumped off the bench while re-enacting I Am 16 Going On 17 and broke her hip. A lawsuit ensued. Now you could only view it from the outside. At the time, this struck us with the force of a genuine sadness. \n \n However much one mocks it, there is something enduringly and weirdly irresistible about the Sound of Music, although if I watch NBC on Thursday night, it won't be because of that. Where Andrews found a little quietness and subtlety in the score, Underwood, judging by the teasers, will go at it with the pop-eyed mania of someone performing for Simon Cowell. No, I'll be watching because it's live; something will go wrong. ||||| Broadway on TV \n \n Was Carrie Underwood a good Maria? No. Was NBC\u2019s decision to do a live staging of \u2018The Sound of Music\u2019 a good one? Maybe not. Was it fun anyway? Actually, kinda. \n \n The poor hills. They finally come alive, only to experience a rotating flurry of emotions so dizzying it's as if the indefatigable Carrie Underwood started spinning on them at the beginning of NBC's The Sound of Music Live! and didn't stop for the entire three-hour broadcast. And, honestly, the country singer tackled her turn as Maria with such grating gusto she'd probably had done just that if she was asked to. \n \n The experience of watching The Sound of Music Live! was a bit of an exhausting one. Not a bad one. Not a good one. But one that took energy. \n \n There was weathering the crippling outrage over the project's mere existence\u2014the nerve of staging a production without Julie Andrews in the lead!\u2014that could very well have grounded the whole affair had NBC not been so bullish on it. Then came the hopefulness, a quick prayer to worn-out Sound of Music VHS tapes we all watched growing up that the production wouldn't be a train wreck. The quick sigh of relief came at the sound of the nuns prettily singing the opening song, only to be followed by the gut-punch suffocation of every breath when, all-of-a-sudden, Carrie Underwood was frolicking manically in a fake forest wearing Austrian drag. Nothing, really, can prepare one for that. \n \n The roller coaster of emotions never really ceased. Are your eyes tired? It's from a combination of excessive cringing and sustained weeping. So much of the broadcast was hard to watch, not so much the fault of the actors as the actually quite subpar show being performed and the whole idea of the live telecast itself. And just as much of it was shockingly moving, thanks in Alps-sized part to the glorious talents of Tony-winners Audra MacDonald and Laura Benanti in scene-stealing supporting roles. \n \n Listen, it takes a lot of effort to twirl energetically on a mountaintop and make it look good. The effort it took to put on The Sound of Music Live! radiated off the screen, draining the energy of the viewers who watched. But, occasionally, it even turned into, as Maria would sing, something good. \n \n Sadly, it wasn't until she sang \"Something Good\" that Underwood's tireless guile finally succeeded in winning over the audience. Her performance of the song had confidence (now's a good time to lament that \"I Have Confidence,\" a song added just to the film version of The Sound of Music, was not featured in this production) that took the American Idol winner nearly the entire show to properly build. Naturally, Underwood sounded astounding, as alive as those damned hills, every time she was asked to stand on top of things and belt. But whether it was because of nerves or lack of experience, her acting was painfully lifeless and amateur throughout the first two thirds of the lengthy ordeal. The singer, it seems, is a proud graduate of the school of \"If I don't blink, they'll think I'm acting!\" \n \n To say that Underwood was no Julie Andrews is one of life's greatest certainties, and maybe it's not fair to compare the two stars. But the truth is that millions of people tuned in Thursday night to do just that, compare Underwood to Andrews\u2026 and then throw her off an Alps cliff when she didn't measure up. Underwood's performance, however, really just underlined what a tricky role Maria is to pull off, and how astounding it is that Andrews managed to do it. Andrews skipped through the role with the ceaseless ebullience of a baby deer in spring, imbuing that effervescence in everything from a mountaintop spin to yodeling with wooden puppets to a romance with grouchy Christopher Plummer. Girl was brave. Remember that boyish bob? \n \n Underwood was like a deer, too. But one in headlights. \n \n Because of that, one can't really tell if it was a brilliant or boneheaded idea to surround her with a supporting cast of such talented actors. First of all, this telecast featured some of the best singing nuns since Whoopi Goldberg was Back in the Habit. That roller coaster of emotions we were talking about earlier? We were rocketed through some prolific loop-de-loops just two bars into Audra MacDonald's rendition of \"Climb Ev'ry Mountain\" as Mother Abbess. If you didn't shed a tear during that epic performance, you might be an Underwood. I mean a robot. Heck, even Underwood was full-on ugly crying during the performance, likely betraying the inner monologue: \"Audra MacDonald is belting this song in my ear and I will never find such happiness again.\" \n \n Then there's the radiant Laura Benanti as Captain Von Trapp's (Vampire Bill himself, Stephen Moyer) hope-to-be fianc\u00e9, Elsa Schraeder. Along with Smash and Broadway alum Christian Borle, she can now be certified as an expert spelunker, for the feats of mining she did to surface errant bits of comedy from the overly earnest script the cast was working with. When Elsa breaks up with Von Trapp and sulks off stage near the end, you hate to see her go. Though Benanti looks good while she leaves. Her costuming was flawless. \n \n (Sidebar conspiracy theory: the wardrobe department was out to sabotage Underwood. Take the party scene. Every guest is outfitted in exquisite ball gowns and tuxedos. Underwood is wearing an oversized milkmaid's dress, frumpier than the milkmaid's dress she wore in the previous scene\u2026 but not as frumpy as the one she put on for the next one. So much frump!) \n \n So, yes, the cast did work exceptionally hard, none more than Underwood, to give her the credit she truly deserves, to sell the material. The material, however, is The Sound of Music. And it's not even The Sound of the Music movie, it's the stage show. And The Sound of Music stage show is a bit whack. \n \n Get The Beast In Your Inbox!

We will not share your email with anyone for any reason \n \n It's a musical where, essentially, three songs are sung six times each at various points throughout the show and you're expected not to get bored of them. It's a show with two major conflicts. In one, a father is upset that his children's clothes are made out of curtains. In the other, the Nazis are invading Austria. They are given the same weight. It's a show where a Mother Superior at an abbey sings an epically moving ballad to a scared young nun, and you later realize that she was just telling the nun to go out there, sex herself up a little, and break up a pending marriage. The Sound of Music: The Story of Maria, the Hussy Nun. \n \n Worse for fans of the movie who may not have even realized that it was also a stage production, there are loads of differences between the stage show and the film, especially in what are now iconic scenes. Maria sings \"My Favorite Things\" in the abbey to Mother Abbess, not to the children. Love the yodeling puppets from the \"Lonely Goatherd\" scene? They're not there, because Maria now sings it with the children in her bedroom, sans props. And there's no synchronized bench hopping at all in the choreography of \"I Am Sixteen (Going on Seventeen).\" It's a tragedy. \n \n The mood of the whole piece was weird, too. Though it was performed live, it was shot as if it was a movie, on what must be the biggest soundstage of all time\u2014the set was massive. So you never saw a proscenium, stage curtains, or an audience. Laugh lines didn't receive laughter. Vamping for applause after a song never actually had applause to vamp to. The hybrid nature of the project ended up zapping the energy from both worlds\u2014film and live theater\u2014rather than combining them.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Before last night's live production of The Sound of Music on NBC, Emma Brockes summed up everything that was certainly going to be wrong with it in the Guardian: The original, beloved though it may be, \"is basically terrible: too long, too pious, too labored in its point-making.\" But Julie Andrews managed to find \"a little quietness and subtlety in the score,\" whereas \"Underwood, judging by the teasers, will go at it with the pop-eyed mania of someone performing for Simon Cowell,\" Brockes writes. \"There are certain things one doesn't look to winners of American Idol to deliver and guilelessness is one of them.\" So how did it actually end up? Most reviewers seem to agree Brockes was right: In Time, Charlotte Alter sums things up with her headline: \"How Do You Solve A Problem Like Carrie Underwood?\" She deems the show \"so cringe-worthy that it was at least fun to watch\" and rounds up nine things that went wrong, including Stephen Moyer, who played Captain Von Trapp: His \"accent was sometimes German and sometimes English, which was weird because Underwood\u2019s accent was always Southern.\" She also offers up suggestions for actors who would have done a better job than Underwood, including Morgan Freeman. On the Daily Beast, Kevin Fallon feels basically the same way: \"Was Carrie Underwood a good Maria? No. Was NBC's decision to do a live staging of The Sound of Music a good one? Maybe not. Was it fun anyway? Actually, kinda,\" he writes. \"To say that Underwood was no Julie Andrews is one of life's greatest certainties, and maybe it's not fair to compare the two stars. But the truth is that millions of people tuned in Thursday night to do just that, compare Underwood to Andrews ... and then throw her off an Alps cliff when she didn't measure up.\" As for the production itself, it \"came off without a hitch,\" writes Marc Bernardin at the Hollywood Reporter. That's \"no easy feat with so many moving parts and opportunities for blown lines or staircase stumbles (oh, how I wished for a staircase stumble to lighten the three hours).\" And the non-Underwood cast, with the exception of a constipated-looking Moyer, was very strong.",

    "document": "Format: Hardcover \n \n After a decade at National Public Radio, Ken Stern learned a few things about the weird world of the American nonprofit sector. In his new book, With Charity for All: Why Charities Are Failing and a Better Way to Give, Stern bemoans the state of charitable activity today, arguing that most of the nonprofit sector is financially inept at best, and downright unsavory at worst. \n \n \n \n Some charities obviously are fraudulent. Every now and then we read about them. When the salary of the CEO and money spent on phone banks dwarf the tiny percentage of revenues, if any, that go to the supposed beneficiaries of a charity, it's easy to call foul. But it's not always so easy to identify this type of non-charity. Getting charitable status from the IRS is a breeze, state oversight is weak to non-existent, and plenty of donors are swayed by words like \"veteran,\" \"children,\" \"hope,\" \"beneficial,\" \"cancer,\" and other key words. Investigating the financials of charities can be time-consuming, frustrating, and near impossible. \n \n \n \n Other charities, while more above-board about their financials and activities, probably should not be classified as charities. Two examples Stern explores are non-profit hospitals and college football bowl games. In terms of treating needy patients, non-profit hospitals as a whole are no more charitable, and in some cases less, than their for-profit competitors. Yet they enjoy a variety of tax benefits that give them a competitive advantage. With the bowl games, it's even harder to say that they are \"charities\" with the money they spend on golf outings, high salaries, travel, and entertainment. Similarly, Stern points the finger at opera companies, charities which exist primarily for the benefit of--their donors! ||||| Our Top Charities \n \n We recommend few charities by design, because we see ourselves as a finder of great giving opportunities rather than a charity evaluator. In other words, we're not seeking to classify large numbers of charities as \"good\" or \"bad\"; our mission is solely to identify, and thoroughly investigate, the best. Read about our charity selection process and where we currently recommend that donors give.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The fiscal cliff isn't the only looming financial deadline. Just a few days remain to give to charity in 2012, and Ken Stern would prefer you not make your decision \"hastily, based on poor information.\" Writing for the Washington Post, the former NPR exec and author of this upcoming book dispels five myths clouding the topic: It's not all about the poor: There are 1.1 million charities in America ... including Oregon's Renegade Roller Derby team, the All Colorado Beer Festival, and countless hospitals. Stern explains it's \"astonishingly easy\" to form a charity, with the IRS OKing 99.5% of applications from would-be charities. Low overhead is a sign of greatness: A number of charity raters favor those who put upward of 85% of their income toward services, with those using just a sliver of cash on expenses often seen as the best. But investing in things like research and training can make for stronger charities. To wit, Stern reminds us that the Red Cross' Hurricane Katrina and Sandy issues stemmed in part from inadequate investment \"in the infrastructure necessary to handle complex emergency relief.\" Picking a great charity to give to is easy: \"In fact, it is enormously difficult,\" writes Stern who, as example, points out that more than 60,000 charities have the word \"veteran\" in their names. His solution isn't the easiest: Work at it. \"On average, Americans spend more time watching television in one day than they do researching charities in an entire year.\" Put the time in, review studies published by GiveWell, and look beyond famous leaders or catchy stories. Click for two more myths, including the idea that nonprofits aren't profitable.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Want to know what \"charities\" are? Just ask Ken Stern. In his new book, With Charity for All: Why charities are failing and a Better Way to Give, Stern argues that \"most of the nonprofit sector is financially inept at best, and downright unsavory at worst,\" reports Forbes. To prove his point, he crunched the numbers on some of the most well-known charities, and found them to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in debt. He also found that more than 90% of the charities he looked at had a \"significant\" or \"substantial\" deficit, meaning they were either unable or unwilling to make a charitable contribution. To get to the bottom of this, he turned to a slew of sources, including Forbes, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, and the Washington Post. He found that most charities had a deficit of at least $100,000, and many of them were in the tens of thousands of dollars. But he also found a handful of charities that had a surplus of more than $1 million, and he was able to zero in on a few of the reasons why: They were in poor shape, they were in need of cash, or they were simply failing.",
