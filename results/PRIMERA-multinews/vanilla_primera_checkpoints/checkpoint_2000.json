However, mercury is harmful to health and to the environment and its use is banned in skin creams. \n \n Studies from the Norwegian Food Safety Authority show there are a number of illegal products available on the market in Norway that contain mercury without it being listed among the ingredients. \n \n Illustration photo: colourbox.com \n \n We ingest low amounts of inorganic mercury via food but not enough to impact our health. Mercury in amalgam fillings can also contribute to inorganic mercury exposure. These are small and insignificant sources compared to the contribution that mercury in skin creams gives to those who use it. \n \n Slowly decomposes \n \n Inorganic mercury is absorbed through the skin from these creams. The absorbed amount will vary, depending on the mercury compound and the other ingredients. \n \n \n \n If you use a lot of cream, more is absorbed into the body. The body excretes inorganic mercury slowly (half-life of 1-2 months) and mercury levels in the body may increase gradually with repeated use. \n \n \n \n The amount of inorganic mercury in the body can be measured in urine. Several studies show a clear correlation between the use of mercury-containing creams and raised urine levels of mercury. \n \n \n \n Children can ingest mercury by coming into contact with the skin of people using these creams. There are also examples of the use of these products on children. \n \n Harmful to health: \n \n Research suggests that there is a correlation between the use of mercury-containing skin creams and kidney damage and impaired renal function \n \n There are also numerous reports of skin damage (different kinds of rashes, uneven pigmentation) after use of these creams \n \n Damage to the central nervous system cannot be excluded with prolonged use \n \n Users also report symptoms such as metallic taste, increased salivation, sores in the mouth and throat, and nausea \n \n Since these products are illegal they are often not considered as a possible cause of health problems. Injury resulting from the use of such products is therefore probably underdiagnosed ||||| Espa\u00f1ol Tagalog \u65e5\u672c\u8a9e \u7b80\u4f53\u4e2d\u6587 \ud55c\uad6d\uc5b4 Vi\u1ec7t \n \n Subscribe: FDA Consumer Health Information \n \n Whatever your complexion, it\u2019s important to use products that will help your skin and not damage it. But as you wade through the beauty aisles, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cautions that you should avoid skin creams, beauty and antiseptic soaps, and lotions that contain mercury. \n \n How will you know if mercury\u2019s in the cosmetic, especially one that\u2019s marketed as \u201canti-aging\u201d or \u201cskin lightening\u201d? Check the label. If the words \u201cmercurous chloride,\u201d \u201ccalomel,\u201d \u201cmercuric,\u201d \u201cmercurio,\u201d or \u201cmercury\u201d are listed on the label, mercury\u2019s in it\u2014and you should stop using the product immediately. \n \n The products are usually marketed as skin lighteners and anti-aging treatments that remove age spots, freckles, blemishes, and wrinkles. Adolescents may use these products as acne treatments. \n \n Jason Humbert of FDA\u2019s Office of Regulatory Affairs says these products usually are manufactured abroad and sold illegally in the United States, often in shops catering to the Latino, Asian, African, or Middle Eastern communities. They are promoted online on social media sites and sold through mobile apps. Consumers may also have bought them in another country and brought them back to the U.S. for personal use, he adds. \n \n If the ingredients aren\u2019t listed and there is no product label, don\u2019t assume it\u2019s fine. Federal law requires that ingredients be listed on the label of any cosmetic or nonprescription drug, so do not use a product that doesn\u2019t have a label. In addition, don\u2019t use drugs or cosmetics labeled in languages other than English unless English labeling is also provided. That\u2019s also a sign that the product may be marketed illegally. \n \n \u201cEven though these products are often promoted as cosmetics, they also may be unapproved new drugs under the law,\u201d says Linda Katz, M.D., director of FDA\u2019s Office of Cosmetics and Colors. FDA does not allow mercury in drugs or in cosmetics, except under very specific conditions where there are no other safe and effective preservatives available \u2013 conditions that these products do not meet. \n \n Sellers and distributors who market mercury-containing skin whitening or lightening creams in the U.S. may be subject to enforcement action, including seizure of products, injunctions, and, in some situations, criminal prosecution. \n \n Dangers of Mercury \n \n Exposure to mercury can have serious health consequences. The danger isn\u2019t just to people who use mercury-containing products but also to their families, says Arthur Simone, M.D., a senior medical advisor at FDA. \n \n \u201cYour family might breathe mercury vapors released from these products. Your children might touch washcloths or towels that are contaminated with mercury. It could be as simple as touching someone\u2019s cheek or face,\u201d Simone says. \n \n Some people \u2013 including pregnant women, nursing babies and young children \u2013 are especially vulnerable to mercury toxicity, he adds. Babies may be particularly sensitive to the harm mercury can cause to their developing brains and nervous systems. Newborns who nurse are vulnerable because mercury is passed into breast milk. \n \n Signs and Symptoms of Mercury Poisoning irritability \n \n shyness \n \n tremors \n \n changes in vision or hearing \n \n memory problems \n \n depression \n \n numbness and tingling in hands, feet or around mouth Source: Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (www.atsdr.cdc. gov/PHS/PHS.asp?id=112&tid=24) \n \n Tracking Skin Products Containing Mercury \n \n In the past few years, FDA and state health officials have discovered numerous products that contain mercury, and there have been cases in which people exposed to such products have had mercury poisoning or elevated levels of mercury in their bodies. FDA has an import alert in place that lets our field staff know that the agency has enough evidence or other information to refuse admission of shipments of mercury-containing skin products. \n \n But this is only a partial solution, Humbert says. \n \n \u201cMany of these products are coming into the country through illegal channels,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for consumers and sellers to know about the dangers of possible mercury poisoning associated with the use of these skin products.\u201d \n \n How to Protect Yourself \n \n Thoroughly wash your hands and other parts of your body that have come in contact with products that contain mercury. \n \n Contact your health care professional or a medical care clinic for advice. If you have questions, call your health care professional or the Poison Center at 1-800-222-1222; it is open 24 hours a day. \n \n Before throwing out a product that may contain mercury, seal it in a plastic bag or leak-proof container. Check with your local environmental, health, or solid waste agency for disposal instructions. Some communities have special collections or other options for disposing of hazardous household waste. \n \n Updated: July 26, 2016 \n \n back to top ||||| At least 60 people over the past four years in California have suffered mercury poisoning from using skin creams \u2014 many of them homemade \u2014 that were brought from Mexico, according to the California Department of Public Health, which is advising consumers to avoid using the products. \n \n The public health advisory issued Thursday includes creams that are used for lightening skin, fading freckles and blemishes, and treating acne. The creams, which are often light in color and turn dark after prolonged exposure to sunlight, usually come in plain containers either without labels or with handmade labels. \n \n Analyses of some creams have found mercury levels 200,000 times the California legal limit. \n \n Among those who have been sickened are several children who are believed to have been exposed to mercury after a parent or other family member used the cream. In a case earlier this year, a 20-month-old baby was hospitalized twice and given a nasal feeding tube due to mercury poisoning. The child\u2019s mother was using a skin-lightening cream, and doctors believe the baby was exposed from contact with the mother or household items. In another case last year, a 16-year-old boy who used a cream for his acne was treated in a pediatric intensive care unit for almost a month for mercury poisoning. \n \n Symptoms of mercury poisoning in adults include difficulty concentrating, irritability, depression, insomnia, headaches, weight loss and fatigue. Children may have excessive thirst, irritability, disinterest in eating, poor muscle tone, leg cramps or a rash. People can also experience tremors, numbness or tingling in the hands or feet, or weakness in extremities. \n \n People who believe they have been exposed to mercury in a skin cream should contact California Poison Control at (800) 222-1222. They should stop using the creams but not dispose of them unless told to do so, in case the products need to be tested.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If someone tries to sell you unmarked or homemade skin cream, just walk away. That's the message the California Department of Health is sending to consumers, after identifying at least 60 cases over the past four years of state residents getting mercury poisoning from such creams, the San Francisco Chronicle reports. In a public health advisory yesterday, it revealed that analysts had found creams from Mexico designed to lighten skin, fade blemishes, and treat acne contained as much as 200,000 times the legal limit of mercury. The problem isn't a new one. The FDA and various state health departments have in recent years issued similar warnings, sounding the alarm about creams not just from Mexico, but from many countries. It warned customers to look for ingredients like \"mercurous chloride,\" \"calomel,\" \"mercuric,\" \"mercurio,\" or plain old \"mercury.\" The products use mercury, Health Canal explains, because it suppresses the production of melanin in skin, lightening it. But it takes a long time for absorbed inorganic mercury to leave the body, so repeated use can raise the risk of harmful effects. Indeed, the Chronicle notes that a 16-year-old who used one such cream to treat his acne ended up in intensive care for nearly a month due to poisoning.",

    "document": "4 years ago \n \n San Antonio, TX (CNN) - Rick Perry may be giving up what he called \"the greatest job in modern politics.\" But he's not leaving the Texas-sized political stage that launched his last run for the White House anytime soon. \n \n After an event Monday in San Antonio where he announced he will not be seeking a fourth term as Texas governor, Perry was asked what he plans on doing with the time off he has coming. \n \n \n \n \"No time off man. What are you talking about? You weren't paying attention in there,\" Perry told CNN. \n \n During a 15-minute speech thanking his family and supporters, Perry vowed to stay busy around the Texas state house. He repeatedly referred to the fight over abortion rights currently consuming the capitol in Austin. \n \n But the Texas governor offered few clues about his political future, despite billing Monday's announcement as an unveiling of \"exciting\" plans. \n \n Perry seemed prepared to announce only that he would \"pray and reflect and work to determine\" what comes next. \n \n \"Any future considerations I will announce in due time and I will arrive at that decision appropriately,\" Perry told the crowd. \n \n Perry: 2016 \u2018certainly an option\u2019 \n \n Perry's reluctance or unwillingness to reveal any upcoming plans stunned some in the San Antonio crowd. \n \n \"Not making future announcement. Wow,\" Matt Mackowiak, an Austin-based Republican strategist tweeted from the event. \n \n Still, the campaign-style video that played on the jumbo screen before Perry's remarks left no doubt the Texas Governor and his team believe they still have a story to tell. \n \n Touting the state's robust job growth over glossy film images of the stark Texan landscape and people, Perry brags in a long Lone Star drawl, \"Texas is not merely strong but exceptional.\" \n \n \"It's obviously on his mind,\" said one former Perry staffer at the San Antonio event, referring to the possibility of another run for the White House. \n \n \"The sky's the limit,\" said another Perry loyalist, before conceding some Republicans would have to get over other \"remembrances.\" \n \n That was a reference to the near implosion of Perry's last campaign during his disastrous November 2011 GOP debate in Michigan. The Texas Governor famously forgot the third of three departments of the federal government he would eliminate as president. \"Oops,\" Perry finally said, after failing to jog his memory in an excruciating and unforgettable television moment. \n \n After that night, Perry pressed on only to stumble through the early primary and caucus states before bowing out in South Carolina. \n \n The Texas governor has tried at times to explain his dismal 2012 performance. He has lamented his late entry into the race. \n \n Still, Perry barreled into the 2012 race as an instant threat to eventual Republican nominee Mitt Romney's front-runner status. Now, as governor for the next 18 months, Perry would still have access to a potent donor base. \n \n Perry acknowledged he is keeping an eye on 2016 in an interview on Fox News Sunday. \"Certainly, that's an option out there,\" Perry told Fox News. \n \n In deciding against a fourth bid for governor, Perry has now paved the way for Texas Attorney General, Greg Abbott to run for and likely win the state's Republican gubernatorial nomination. State Senator Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, who last month filibustered a bill to restrict abortion rights in Texas, is frequently mentioned as a potential Democratic contender. \n \n Several GOP strategists in the room at Perry's San Antonio event expect Abbott to make a formal announcement as soon as this weekend. Perry's decision to omit specific mentions about any future plans may have been out of courtesy to Abbott. \n \n There were other notable faces in the crowd. Lee Majors, the star of the 70's era action show, \"The Six Million Dollar Man,\" was also in attendance. \n \n The sight of the actor who played the fictional astronaut, given super human strength after a near-death experience, invited some observers to wonder whether the same can be done for Perry's political career. \n \n It's Perry's life that has been the stuff of Hollywood. Raised in the tiny town of Paint Creek, Perry rose to become the state's longest-serving governor. He assumed the governorship in December 2000, when George W. Bush stepped down to become president. Perry was elected to full four-year terms in 2002, 2006 and 2010. \n \n \"It's been an improbable journey,\" Perry told the crowd. ||||| Rick Perry, the longest-serving governor in Texas history who famously muttered \"oops\" after forgetting during a 2011 presidential debate the third of three federal departments he'd pledged to close, announced Monday he won't seek re-election next year to a fourth full term. \n \n FILE - In this Jan. 21, 2003, file photo Texas Gov.

(Associated Press) \n \n A staunch Christian conservative, proven job-creator and fierce defender of states' rights, Perry has been in office nearly 13 years, making him the nation's longest-sitting current governor. \n \n The 63-year-old ruled out another try for the White House in 2016, but Perry's decision not to run again for his current post likely clears the way for longtime Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott to make a serious run at the Republican gubernatorial nomination in the March primary. \n \n Perry had initially promised to divulge his future plans by July 1 but was forced to push that back following a rare political victory by state Democrats _ a filibuster of abortion restrictions during the first 30-day special legislative session. \n \n He called 30 more days of work to finish the job and suggested that would further delay his announcement, but then he distributed an email to a small group of friends and supporters last week promising he'd reveal \"exciting future plans\" Monday in San Antonio. The Caterpillar dealership he announced his plans at is the same place he announced his re-election bid for a third term in 2009. \n \n Perry had never lost an election during his 27-year political career and became a near-instant front-runner when he strapped on his signature cowboy boots and strode into the crowded race for the GOP presidential nomination in August 2011. A ferocious fundraiser who was buoyed by both tea party activists and mainstream Republicans, Perry had presided over a Texas economy that was booming and had such TV anchorman good looks he was dubbed by some \"governor good hair.\" \n \n But his presidential run flamed out spectacularly, culminating in a debate where Perry remembered that he'd pledged to shutter the U.S. Departments of Commerce and Education but forgot the other one, the Department of Energy. Quipped late-night comedian Jimmy Fallon: \"It turns out George Bush was actually the smart Texas governor.\" \n \n Perry first endorsed former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in the race then turned his support behind the eventual nominee, Mitt Romney. \n \n It was a long way to fall for Perry, considered the most powerful Texas governor since the Civil War. The governorship had traditionally been a weak one, with the lieutenant governor charged with overseeing the Legislature. \n \n Perry set the tone for his tenure in June 2001, however, vetoing more than 80 bills in what became known in Austin as the \"Father's Day Massacre.\" Since then, he has vetoed scores of other would-be laws, including a $35 billion public education budget and a ban on executing mentally disabled inmates. \n \n But most of Perry's power has come from his sheer longevity, remaining in office long enough to tap loyalists _ and sometimes even his top donors _ to every major appointed post statewide. \n \n His tendency to shoot from the hip has occasionally caused problems. Ending a television interview in 2005, Perry smirked at the camera and signed off: \"Adios, mofo.\" He claimed he didn't know he was still on the air, but it became a kind of Texas catchphrase. \n \n Four years later, Perry hinted the state might want to secede from the U.S. While jogging in a rural corner of Austin in 2010, meanwhile, he somehow produced a laser-sighted pistol from his running shorts and shot dead a coyote he said was menacing his daughter's dog. \n \n Just last month, Perry had a notable dust-up with state Sen. Wendy Davis, who led the abortion filibuster and is considered the likely front-runner for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination should she run. \n \n Perry claimed Davis should have understood the value of each human life because of her history as a former teenage mother who went on to graduate from Harvard Law School. Davis shot back that Perry's statement \"tarnishes the high office he holds.\" \n \n Perry won a seat in the Texas Legislature as a Democrat in 1984, when Texas was still reliably blue. As the state turned deeply red, so did Perry, becoming lieutenant governor in 1998 and taking his current post when Bush left for the White House in December 2000. \n \n Though he has sought to become another Texan in the White House, Perry and Bush actually don't get along very well. Austin insiders trace the bad blood between their respective camps back to 1998 and Bush refusing Perry's request to appoint his attorney brother-in-law to a judgeship. And, in 2011, the Bush family endorsed Romney _ not Perry. \n \n Still, Perry won re-election as governor in 2002 and 2006, and then trounced U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison in what was supposed to be a prolonged and bruising battle for the GOP gubernatorial nomination in 2010. That year's general election against Democrat Bill White was even easier. ||||| Texas Gov.

He said Abbott has no campaign events planned for this week, but did note Abbott has a meet-and-greet scheduled with supporters in San Antonio on July 14. \n \n Abbott\u2019s war chest dwarfed Perry\u2019s at last count. Abbott had about $18 million on hand at the end of last year, according to Texas Ethics Commission filings. Perry had about $6 million. Observers in Austin took that as one sign that Perry was likely on his way out. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: 5 things to know about Texas Gov.

Sixty percent said he should not run for reelection, according to Democratic firm Public Policy Polling.

The jury awarded the family $4, $1 for each of Hill's three children and $1 for funeral expenses. The family, however, received just 4 cents (1 percent of the $4 award). \n \n Evans asked how he could help the family in a tweet Saturday and was directed to a GoFundMe page that was created after the verdict. Evans' donation helped push the total raised to nearly $100,000. \n \n When the 24-year-old wide receiver signed his five-year, $82 million extension in March, Evans said of his charity plans, \"It's hard to put into words.

The jury awarded Hill's Estate $4 ($1 for each child's pain and suffering and $1 for funeral expenses) and found him 99% at fault, reducing the total verdict to 4 cents. It will be appealed.This gofundme is designed to pick up where the jury left off and provide for Hill's children, repair of the home and serve to make sure justice can be obtained.On January 14, 2014, a St. Lucie County Sheriff's Office deputy shot and killed Gregory Hill through his closed garage door after responding to a loud music complaint. Gregory Hill was in his garage listening to Drake's song 'All Me' when police responded. Police spent 60 seconds on Hill's property, banged violently on his garage door with an asp, leaving dents on it, and then claimed Hill was an aggressor when he simply opened (and then quickly closed) his garage door. Police shot 4 times, striking Hill 3 times.Police claimed Hill had a gun in his hand as the garage door went up and down. Hill's own daughter attended school across the street and watched as her father was shot and killed. She and several school witnesses saw no gun in his hand. An unloaded gun was found in Hill's back pocket. That gun was free of any blood or brain splatter or material DNA. The location of Hill's wounds discredit any theory of holding a gun where it was identified. Forensic testimony also revealed Hill was incapable of putting that gun back in his pocket after being shot in the head.The shooting officer claimed he screamed, \"Sheriff's Office. Gun, gun, put down the gun,\" three to four times before firing. Tests revealed this would have taken well in excess of 9 to 10 seconds, far more than the 3 seconds one officer testified was the total time the door went up and down. Further, neither officer heard the other yell a single word except, \"hey.\" Witnesses across the street heard the officers banging on the door, but never heard a single command.Despite these facts, the jury deliberated for 10 hours. After once saying they couldn't reach a verdict, they reached a verdict. They awarded $1 to each of Hill's three children and $1 for funeral expenses. They found Hill 99% responsible for his own death. As such, the total verdict was $.04 cents, which was reduced to $0.Gregory Hill was raised in the same house where he was shot and killed. And he was raising his children in the same family home. The home was also destroyed as police shoot chemical agent through nearly every window of the home, falsely claiming Hill was alive and \"barricaded\" inside. Memories were destroyed, toys were contaminated and even some of the keepsakes for his upcoming wedding were poisoned by police attempting to poison a man they had already killed.The family attorney, John Phillips, will place any and all funds in an account, reserved for the children of Greg Hill and ensure that the funds are protected, that the family home is repaired or restored and that the children's needs are taken care of. Should they be necessary, some funds may be reserved for the court costs in this matter. A full accounting will be provided to the family and the family and legal team are working together to have a full plan for the best distribution of all funds.Please help this family.

Wii U video games inside a Nintendo World store in New York. \n \n The revisions increase the pressure on Iwata, who vowed in October to meet a forecast of 100 billion yen in full-year operating profit and 9 million units in Wii U sales. Nintendo has lost about 80 percent of its market value since the introduction of the original Wii drove shares to a record high of 72,100 yen in November 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. \n \n Its market capitalization is about $20 billion -- less than Samsung\u2019s previously announced capital expenditures. \n \n \u201cThe revision is much worse than expected,\u201d Yusuke Tsunoda, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co. in Tokyo, said by phone. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a third consecutive annual operating loss and that raises a serious management issue.\u201d \n \n Iwata said any announcement about a pay cut would come later this month when the company releases third-quarter earnings. There are no plans to reshuffle management in the near term, he said. \n \n Lower Dividend \n \n The company reduced its planned dividend for the fiscal year to 100 yen from 260 yen.

The tally, the highest since spending hit $1.84 billion in December 2010, drove total retail sales for the industry to their fifth straight monthly gain. \n \n Price Cut \n \n The Wii U features a tablet-like, 6.2-inch touchscreen controller that lets players connect wirelessly to the console and shift the display between the device and a television. The consoles compete in a market where smartphone sales are on track to exceed 1 billion units this year, researcher IDC said Oct. 29. \n \n The Wii U\u2019s price in the U.S. was cut by $50 to $299.99 on Sept. 20, while the Japanese price remained a suggested 30,000 yen. \n \n Nintendo introduced the 2DS portable machine, resembling a tablet, in October for $129.99 to lure first-time and casual gamers. \n \n The global video-game market may reach $111 billion by 2015, researcher Gartner Inc. said Oct. 29. Mobile games are the fastest-growing segment, with revenue set to reach $22 billion by 2015 from $13.2 billion this year, Gartner said. \n \n \u201cWe cannot continue a business without winning,\u201d Iwata said. \u201cWe must take a skeptical approach whether we can still simply make game players, offer them in the same way as in the past for 20,000 yen or 30,000 yen, and sell titles for a couple of thousand yen each.\u201d \n \n To contact the reporters on this story: Masatsugu Horie in Osaka at mhorie3@bloomberg.net; Takashi Amano in Tokyo at tamano6@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Michael Tighe at mtighe4@bloomberg.net ||||| Logos are seen on Nintendo Co's Wii U game console (bottom) and its controller at the company's headquarters in Kyoto, western Japan in this January 7, 2013 file photo. \n \n TOKYO Nintendo Co Ltd said on Friday that sales of its Wii U consoles had flopped, pushing it to a third consecutive annual loss and raising a question mark over its future in a home console market increasingly dominated by Sony Corp and Microsoft Corp. \n \n The company that got its start making playing cards more than a century ago slashed its global Wii U sales forecast for the year to March 31 by almost 70 percent to 2.8 million units. It cut its sales forecast for its handheld 3DS to 13.5 million units from 18 million. The Wii U is the successor to its hit Wii console. \n \n Nintendo's president, Satoru Iwata, who last year pledged to return the hobbled game maker to profit this business year, apologized to shareholders at a briefing in Osaka, but said his failure to fulfill his promise did not mean he had to resign. \n \n \"There will be no major management shake-up in the short term,\" Iwata told reporters. \n \n Pressure will likely mount on the architect of the Wii success in 2006 to step aside or shift course to focus on making money from \"Super Mario\" and other software titles. Nintendo so far has refused to allow its games to be played on machines built by competitors or on tablets or other mobile devices that are used by gamers. \n \n In the past the company has blamed a lack of titles for poor sales, but even its popular family-friendly games are losing out on sales to more hard-core titles like \"Grand Theft Auto\" played on rival machines. \n \n \"The fact that the 'Wii U strategy' has failed is disappointing and will likely trigger a sell-off as soon as the market opens,\" said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management. \n \n Nintendo this business year now expects an operating loss of 35 billion yen ($335.76 million) compared with an initial forecast for a 100 billion yen profit. The new estimate also falls drastically short of the average forecast of a 54.7 billion yen profit in a survey of 18 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \n \n The latest warning comes just three months after the Japanese company reiterated its sales projections for the Wii U, counting on the console to revive its fortunes as Microsoft released its new XBox One and Sony released its PlayStation 4 to the public. \n \n \"We failed to reach our target for hardware sales during the year-end, when revenues are the highest,\" said Iwata. \n \n In 2006, Iwata was celebrated worldwide after creating a new niche with the Wii console designed for the whole family to use rather than hardcore gamers. That success boosted Nintendo's cash pile to around $14 billion, money it will have to dip into again to help cover its latest deficit. \n \n Nintendo on Friday also warned of a net loss of 25 billion yen for the year ending on March 31, a substantial reversal from its prior projection of a 55 billion yen profit. It now expects revenues of 590 billion yen, down 36 percent from its prior forecast. It cut its full-year dividend to 100 yen from 260 yen. \n \n Nintendo shares have fallen almost 10 percent since hitting a two-and-a-half year high of 15,880 yen on January 10. The stock climbed 55 percent in 2013, in line with a 57 percent rally by the benchmark Nikkei average but underperforming a 91 percent surge by rival Sony. \n \n ($1 = 104.2400 Japanese yen) \n \n (Additional reporting by Ayai Tomisawa, Dominic Lau and Reiji Murai; Writing by Tim Kelly; Editing by Edmund Klamann and Matt Driskill)",

Before arriving at 67P/C-G, the ROSINA team thought that at these vast distances from the Sun, its relatively low intensity would only release the most volatile molecules via sublimation, namely carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. \n \n However, ROSINA has detected many more molecules. Indeed, as of our 11 September report, ROSINA\u2019s inventory of detected gases 67P/C-G looked like this: \n \n Water (H 2 O) \n \n Carbon monoxide (CO) \n \n Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) \n \n Ammonia (NH 3 ) \n \n Methane (CH 4 ) \n \n Methanol (CH 3 OH) \n \n But today we can report that the following have also been detected: \n \n Formaldehyde (CH 2 O) \n \n Hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) \n \n Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) \n \n Sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ) \n \n Carbon disulphide (CS 2 ) \n \n If you could smell the comet, you would probably wish that you hadn\u2019t \ud83d\ude42 \n \n As the Kathrin Altwegg, principal investigator for ROSINA, put it: \u201cThe perfume of 67P/C-G is quite strong, with the odour of rotten eggs (hydrogen sulphide), horse stable (ammonia), and the pungent, suffocating odour of formaldehyde. This is mixed with the faint, bitter, almond-like aroma of hydrogen cyanide. Add some whiff of alcohol (methanol) to this mixture, paired with the vinegar-like aroma of sulphur dioxide and a hint of the sweet aromatic scent of carbon disulphide, and you arrive at the \u2018perfume\u2019 of our comet.\u201d \n \n While this is unlikely to be a particularly attractive perfume, remember that the density of these molecules is very low, and that the main part of the coma is made up of water and carbon dioxide, mixed with carbon monoxide. \n \n The key point, however, is that a detailed analysis of this mixture and how it varies as 67P/C-G grows more active will allow scientists to determine the comet\u2019s composition. Further work will show how 67P/C-G compares with other comets, for example by revealing differences between comets originating from the Kuiper Belt (like 67P/C-G) and comets that hail from the distant Oort cloud (like Comet Siding Spring, which recently flew past Mars). The goal is to gain insights into the fundamental chemical make-up of the solar nebula from which our Solar System and, ultimately, life itself emerged. \n \n *For a simple explanation of mass spectra and associated units, see Wikipedia\u2019s entry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrum \n \n For more detailed information on ROSINA, see our description here. ||||| Rotten eggs, horse pee, alcohol and bitter almonds: this is the bouquet of odours you would smell if a comet in deep space could be brought back to Earth, European scientists said Rotten eggs, horse pee, alcohol and bitter almonds: this is the bouquet of odours you would smell if a comet in deep space could be brought back to Earth, European scientists said on Thursday. \n \n An instrument aboard the probe Rosetta has detected some intriguing chemical signatures from Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko since their rendezvous in deep space in August, they said. \n \n Molecules include ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulphide, hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde. \n \n \"If you could smell the comet, you probably wish that you hadn't,\" the team said wryly in a blog posted on the European Space Agency (ESA) website. \n \n The device, called Rosina-DFMS, is a mass spectrometer\u2014it has been analysing the signature of gas given off by the \"coma,\" the comet's head, as the distance closes with the Sun. \n \n \"The perfume of 67P/C-G is quite strong, with the odour of rotten eggs (hydrogen sulphide), horse stable (ammonia) and the pungent, suffocating odour of formaldehyde,\" said Kathrin Altwegg, Rosina's chief scientist. \n \n \"This is mixed with the faint, bitter, almond-like aroma of hydrogen cyanide. \n \n \"Add some whiff of alcohol (methanol) to this mixutre, paired with the vinegar-like aroma of sulphur dioxide and a hint of the sweet aromatic scent of carbon disulphide, and you arrive at the 'perfume' of our comet.\" \n \n The detection of so many different molecules at this stage has been a surprise, ESA said. \n \n The Rosina team believed only the most volatile molecules\u2014carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide\u2014would be released as the comet's icy surface started slowly to warm. \n \n On a 6.5-year orbit, 67P/C-G is the target of an ambitious mission to shed light on the origins of comets, ancient travellers of the Solar System. \n \n Rosetta caught up with it after a six-billion-kilometre (3.75-billion-mile) trek that required four flybys of Earth and Mars, using the planets' gravity as a slingshot to build up speed. \n \n It is now in close orbit around the comet at a distance of around 400 million kilometres from the Sun. The scout will send down a robot lander, Philae, on November 12 to carry out on-the-spot scientific tests. \n \n On August 13 next year, the comet and Rosetta will be 185 million kilometres from the Sun, their closest approach to our star. \n \n Explore further: Comet-chasing probe closes in on target ||||| [image-36] \n \n The European Space Agency\u2019s Rosetta mission will deploy its lander, Philae, to the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko on Nov. 12. \n \n Rosetta is an international mission spearheaded by the European Space Agency with support and instruments provided by NASA. \n \n Philae\u2019s landing site, currently known as Site J, is located on the smaller of the comet\u2019s two \"lobes,\" with a backup site on the larger lobe. The sites were selected just six weeks after Rosetta's Aug. 6 arrival at the comet, following the spacecraft's 10-year journey through the solar system. \n \n In that time, the Rosetta mission has been conducting an unprecedented scientific analysis of the comet, a remnant from early in the solar system\u2019s 4.6-billion-year history. The latest results from Rosetta will be presented when Philae lands, during dedicated press briefings. \n \n The main focus to date has been to survey 67P/Churyumov\u2013Gerasimenko in order to prepare for the first-ever attempt to soft-land on a comet. \n \n The descent to the comet is passive and it is only possible to predict that the landing point will be within a \"landing ellipse\" (typically a few hundred yards or meters in size). For each of Rosetta's candidate sites, a larger area -- four-tenths of a square mile (one square kilometer) -- was assessed. Site J was chosen unanimously as the primary landing site because the majority of terrain within an area that size has slopes of less than 30 degrees relative to the local vertical and because there are relatively few large boulders. The area also receives sufficient daily illumination to recharge Philae and continue surface science operations beyond the initial 64-hour battery-powered phase. \n \n Over the last two weeks, the flight dynamics and operations teams at ESA have been making a detailed analysis of flight trajectories and timings for Rosetta to deliver the lander at the earliest possible opportunity. \n \n Two robust landing scenarios have been identified, one for the primary site and one for the backup. Both anticipate separation and landing on Nov. 12. \n \n For the primary landing scenario, targeting Site J, Rosetta will release Philae at 3:35 a.m. EST (9:35 a.m. Central European Time) at a distance of 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) from the center of the comet, landing about seven hours later. The one-way signal travel time between Rosetta and Earth on Nov. 12 will be 28 minutes and 20 seconds, meaning that confirmation of the landing will arrive at Earth ground stations at around 11 a.m. EST (5 p.m. CET). \n \n If a decision is made to use the backup site, Site C, separation will occur at 8:04 a.m. EST (2:04 p.m. CET) at a distance of 7.8 miles (12.5 kilometers) from the center of the comet. Landing will occur about four hours later, with confirmation on Earth at around 12:30 p.m. EST (6:30 p.m. CET). The timings are subject to uncertainties of several minutes. \n \n Final confirmation of the primary landing site and its landing scenario will be made on October 14 after a formal Lander Operations Readiness Review, which will include the results of additional high-resolution analysis of the landing sites conducted in the meantime. Should the backup site be chosen at this stage, landing can still occur on Nov. 12. \n \n A competition for the public to name the primary landing site will also be announced during the week of Oct. 14. \n \n Following the Philae landing, the Rosetta orbiter will continue to study the comet and its environment using 11 science instruments for another year as the spacecraft and comet orbit the sun together. The comet is on an elliptical 6.5-year orbit that takes it from beyond Jupiter at its farthest point, to between the orbits of Mars and Earth at its closest to the sun. Rosetta will accompany the comet for more than a year as they swing around the sun and back to the outer solar system again. \n \n The analyses made by the Rosetta orbiter will be complemented by the measurements performed on the comet by Philae's 10 instruments. \n \n Comets are time capsules containing primitive material left over from the epoch when the sun and its planets formed. By studying the gas, dust and structure of the nucleus and organic materials associated with the comet, the Rosetta mission should become key to unlocking the history and evolution of our solar system, as well as answering questions regarding the origin of Earth\u2019s water and perhaps even life. \n \n Rosetta is an ESA mission with contributions from its member states and NASA. Rosetta's Philae lander is provided by a consortium led by the German Aerospace Center, Cologne; Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Gottingen; National Center of Space Studies of France (CNES), Paris; and the Italian Space Agency, Rome. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, a division of the California Institute of Technology, manages the U.S. participation in the Rosetta mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \n \n For more information on the U.S. instruments aboard Rosetta, visit: \n \n http://rosetta.jpl.nasa.gov \n \n More information about Rosetta is available at: \n \n http://www.esa.int/rosetta",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Comets stink, and not just because they have the potential to cause cataclysmic devastation if they ever came hurtling through our atmosphere and made impact with Earth. These \"cosmic snowballs of frozen gases, rock, and dust roughly the size of a small town\" (as described by NASA) literally stink to high heaven, according to scientists at Switzerland's University of Bern. One comet does, anyway: Researchers analyzed the \"perfume\" of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and said that its BO is apparently a combo of \"rotten eggs, horse urine, formaldehyde, bitter almonds, alcohol, vinegar, and a hint of sweet ether,\" the AP reports. \"If you could smell the comet, you would probably wish that you hadn't,\" reads a blog post on the European Space Agency site. The scientists were able to surmise what the comet would smell like by examining the gas emitted by the \"coma,\" the comet's head, Phys.org reports. Luckily, instead of a squeamish human, a mass spectrometer aboard the space probe Rosetta was assigned the task of parsing out the perfumed molecules of 67P, including ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen cyanide, and \"the pungent, suffocating (odor) of formaldehyde,\" notes the ESA post. The probe caught up to the comet in August after chasing it nearly 4 billion miles; it will be sending its Philae robot lander onto the comet proper on Nov. 12, NASA reports. And it appears the comet's odoriferous odyssey is just beginning: The lead scientist on the project says that as 67P gets closer to the sun, it will start stinking up the cosmos even more.

    "document": "Screenshot: Saturday Night Live \n \n \u201cOur lives are short and love is rare, now we do the turkey dance.\u201d \n \n \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not an actor, I\u2019m a [comedy, drama, now comedy again?] star!\u201d \n \n The big news that all the kids will be buzzing about is that rumored reboot of The Office that some people apparently really want and tonight\u2019s host Steve Carell says wouldn\u2019t work anyway, for some reasons having to do with \u201ctoday\u2019s climate.\u201d In his opening monologue, Carell got the old \u201cunexpected questions from the audience\u201d treatment, as former The Office-mates Ellie Kemper, Ed Helms, and Jenna Fischer all stood up to urge their former TV boss to sign on so they can get paid, already. (Kenan wants it, too, responding to Carell asking if he\u2019s Kenan or a \u201cfake audience member\u201d by telling Carell, \u201cIf I was acting, you would know.\u201d) That was pretty much the only laugh in the bit, as Carell played straight man to the same-y jokes about how he\u2019s being a dick (Fischer\u2019s words), and how his actual wife and kids don\u2019t really need him around as much as he thinks. He did tease the audience by inviting his Office pals up on stage to guarantee . . . that it would be a great show. (It wasn\u2019t.) \n \n The other joke hammered all week has been how Steve Carell is a big drama guy now, something the show didn\u2019t so much refute as remind viewers of how funny Steve Carell would have been if he were given any decent sketches to act in. Woof, this was a congested wheeze of an episode, packed with sketch after sketch of unimaginative premises, indifferently executed. And that goes for Carell, too, frankly, who seemed listless and uncommitted most of the time. A couple of musical sketches offered him the chance to really belt out some silly material with the confident abandon he\u2019s justifiably renowned for, but, in each, he matched the dullness of the writing in performance. In his third time hosting, Carell and SNL both seemed to be just running out the clock in what was the most deeply disappointing episode of a very uneven season so far. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Weekend Update update \n \n After last week\u2019s news-grabbing, feel-good official apology for a nothing joke (to a newly elected congressman with some seriously questionable views himself), it\u2019s like SNL decided to play defense this week. Or maybe play dead, hoping for the national, not-at-all-manufactured outrage cycle to die down through the upcoming off week. Che and Jost sped past some fairly innocuous political material (Che\u2019s references to the brazen spree of criminal Republican voter suppression tactics aside) in favor of some lame Amazaon jokes. Jost mocking New Yorkers\u2019 complaints about the new Queens Amazon HQ for bringing \u201c25,000 jobs\u201d takes the laziest laugh line from what is a complicated issue, something SNL has long been prone to, but that Jost and Che have occasionally risen above. This, coupled with the other big Amazon piece tonight (see below) smacks of the sort of corporate coziness that just makes SNL look bad, especially with the big news story of Amazon\u2019s move taking place in the show\u2019s backyard, and the attendant controversies. \n \n Tossing to the big post-election satirical landscape, SNL scanned the trees and brought back\u2014Bigfoot porn. The fact that newly elected Republican Congressman Denver Riggleman apparently is way into Bigfoot-themed erotica has predictably dominated media coverage of his campaign. And, sure, that\u2019s some funny stuff right there. But he\u2019s also been allegedly associated with some avowed white supremacists, which is both less funny and more relevant, satirically speaking. So trotting out Mikey Day to portray Riggleman nearly talking himself off to his own Sasquatch porn with some relatively graphic supposed excerpts and even more disturbing grunting noises is picking the lowest-hanging fruit of a satirical target and heavy-breathing on it. Again, if SNL is going to choose to do politics, then it\u2019s going to be judged (by me, at least) on the choices it makes in how to approach the jokes. There are a myriad premises to be plucked from the recent midterm elections. That this was the best they got this week is embarrassing. \n \n Kenan came on again as overbearing and hyperbolic NBA dad LaVar Ball, which is always pleasantly silly. Here, Kenan\u2019s Ball maintained his self-promoting, reality-averse egomania, even as he slipped in the fact that Lakers star LeBron James supposedly has a restraining order against him (They have brunch, \u201calways a respectable 500 feet away\u201d from each other), and bragging about his younger sons\u2019 dad-financed Latvian b-ball careers. (They feast on \u201cthe briniest cabbage this side of Bucharest!\u201d) I love Kenan, and this is the sort of thing he\u2019s wonderful at. \n \n Best/worst sketch of the night \n \n On a night like tonight, it\u2019s a matter of picking out kernels (or \u201ccornels\u201d) of ideas or performances than whole decent sketches, of which none were in evidence. In what was a mostly disastrous ten-to-one (but one) sketch, astronauts having space Thanksgiving with their alien hosts ate screaming purple corn (or \u201ckern\u201d) on the cob. Complete with dropped props, a failed chroma key effect, Pete Davidson\u2019s sped-up corn screams, flubbed lines, and either unwritten or abandoned ending, the debacle played like something infamously intransigent SNL legend Michael O\u2019Donoghue might have written during his ill-fated 1981 head writing stint under Lorne Michaels\u2019 replacement producer Dick Ebersol, when the show was alternately a vehicle for the notoriously uncompromising Mr. Mike\u2019s bizarro visions or his legitimate attempt to turn the floundering post-Lorne enterprise into \u201ca Viking death ship.\u201d \n \n There was a similarly dark, throwback vibe to the space station sketch, too, with Carell\u2019s mission commander attempting to tell stilted astronaut jokes and fun facts to Skyped-in school kids, only for a malfunction to flood the camera feed with dead, frozen monkeys, a cat with its face sucked inside out, and, finally, Kate McKinnon\u2019s very deceased cosmonaut floating rigidly outside the ISS\u2019 bubble window. It didn\u2019t all work\u2014again, Carell never seemed filly into his third hosting gig. But there was some real effort in the physical acting of the bit\u2014apart from the dead McKinnon, Carell, Leslie Jones, and Mikey Day did some fine fake floating, and SNL has room for some darkness in it. After we hear about the unfortunate fate of the poor station kitty, there\u2019s a moment where the beast floats into view with its back to us before it\u2014very slowly\u2014rotates to show just what the vacuum of space can do to a cat-face. That, plus some rictus-frozen, space-suited monkey puppets felt energizingly transgressive, in a way that SNL could stand to risk more often. \n \n The \u201cBeauty School Drop Out\u201d parody musical number had a scrap of a funny idea in that Carell\u2019s apparently heavenly, permed guardian angel is actually teenager Aidy Bryant\u2019s dad, interrupting her 1950s sleepover to croon to her high school dropout friend. The concept that Carell\u2019s dad has been touring the country for six weeks with a carful of sexy backup singer-dancers busting into teenage girls bedrooms has a nice, loony energy to it, and Aidy\u2019s horrified reactions are good. (\u201cGod, what a small man you are.\u201d) Throughout the episode, there was a refreshing attempt at doing some self-contained, conceptual sketches, but this one just didn\u2019t ever lift off. \n \n The Thanksgiving song sketch should have worked better. It, too, took an odd little idea\u2014dinner guests Carell and Cecily Strong maintain there\u2019s a famous Thanksgiving rock song which they proceed to sing in all its specifically inappropriate, boner-shrinking glory\u2014that has the potential to soar along with the musical conceit. But then it, too, just didn\u2019t, as Carell\u2019s seeming diffidence sapped the momentum. It\u2019s not a total loss\u2014the turn that no one actually knows Strong\u2019s character goes from Carell\u2019s conviction that she was some sort of spirit to the revelation that she\u2019s stolen everyone\u2019s car keys and stabbed Beck Bennett\u2019s host is more ambitiously weird than expected. But this one should have been a show-stopper, with everyone eventually remembering the song\u2019s lyrics about a pair of lovers, a shy penis, and a cameo-ing squirrel and joining in the song, so its just-okay aftertaste is a bummer. \n \n Chris Redd and Pete Davidson\u2019s pro-Ruth Bader Ginsburg rap is the sort of thing they (especially Redd) have done better before, with the paean to the ailing but hopefully indestructible Supreme Court justice never expanding appreciably past its premise. It gave Kate McKinnon a chance to wheel out her RBG for some of her signature gyrating as \u201cthe one lady holding the whole damn thing together,\u201d but it\u2019s unlikely to garner another musical SNL Emmy for Redd and company. \n \n The RV sketch, in which Heidi Gardner\u2019s wife unsuccessfully hides how miserable she is since husband Carell cashed out to make her live out his cross-country camper fantasy worked to the extent that it did because Gardner, once more, showed what a fine actress she is on SNL. The sketch had slack pacing, no ending, another blah turn by Carell as the clueless husband, and a very nervous-looking great dane. But it also had Gardner\u2019s peerless squeaking, eyes-averted denial to power it, with her secretly stewing wife not complaining about having to ride in the back (the dog gets carsick), sleep sitting up at the camper\u2019s cramped table, and being in charge of emptying the vehicle\u2019s septic tank before she finally explodes. \n \n By dint of it being the first sketch after the monologue, I\u2019m disinclined to cut the clueless dad sketch much slack. Of all its worst instincts, Saturday Night Live\u2019s need to over-explain a premise is more damaging than musical monologues, game- and talk show sketches, and recurring characters combined. Here, dad Carell\u2019s 5 a.m. announcement that he\u2019s taking his four kids to Disney World sees his progeny immediately asking \u201cOh my god, does he not know?,\u201d \u201cOh no, is our dad dumb?,\u201d and \u201cHow can we know all this and our dad has no idea?\u201d to let us know that Carell\u2019s dad character is dumb and doesn\u2019t know stuff. (Namely that their mom/his wife is sleeping with his boss, has left and moved to Arizona, and two of the kids aren\u2019t his.) Carell, coming out for his first character work of the night, tentatively sets up the sketch-deadening explanatory lines, which leave viewers asking exactly how slow SNL thinks we are. \n \n \u201cWhat do you call that act?\u201d \u201cThe Californians!\u201d\u2014Recurring sketch report \n \n LaVar Ball, Ingraham Angle. Speaking of . . . \n \n \u201cIt was my understanding there would be no math\u201d\u2014Political comedy report \n \n We got another Ingraham Angle cold open tonight, with Kate McKinnon mugging it up as Fox News\u2019 smirking white supremacist and, as she translates from Telemundo\u2019s nickname for her, \u201cLa madre del diablo,\u201d Laura Ingraham. McKinnon\u2019s impression is more about pitch-perfect sneering contempt than vocal verisimilitude, but it\u2019s still a decent vehicle to mock Ingraham\u2019s ongoing campaign against facts, actual reporting, and anything darker than eggshell. Still, this showed the writing already letting the air out of the Alec Baldwin-replacing opening bit, as Ingraham\u2019s breathless report on nonexistent Democratic voter fraud made eye-rolling jabs at Tyler Perry and Eddie Murphy showing up as Madea and the entire Klump family, respectively, to vote multiple times. The joke about Ingraham still scrambling for advertisers willing to sponsor someone who mocked school shooting survivors and, well, lots of other stuff is the sharpest weapon SNL wielded here, with Ingraham happily shilling for the likes of a bejeweled catheter (\u201cOuch.\u201d), teeny, tiny turkeys (because you\u2019ve alienated your entire family in time for Thanksgiving), and Volkswagen (\u201cYou know why.\u201d) Cecily Strong made a welcome reappearance as Fox News legal shouter Jeanine Pirro. (\u201cI hate them Laura!\u201d \u201cWho?\u201d \u201cSorry, that\u2019s my vocal warmup.\u201d) And Alex Moffat continued the show\u2019s questionable choice to portray Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg as being somewhere on the autism spectrum as the whole joke, although him finally blurting, \u201cWhen I do bad things, I get money\u201d at least addressed the most(?) recent Facebook disinformation scandal obliquely. It wasn\u2019t outstanding, but if it keeps Baldwin\u2019s dull and obvious Trump offscreen for another week, I\u2019ll allow it. \n \n Carell\u2019s biggest showcase was in the filmed Amazon piece, where his bald-capped Jeff Bezos smugly outlined all the ways the online behemoth\u2019s new ventures are in no way intended to merely troll Donald Trump. You know, even with drones topped with bad wigs (instead of shaving their heads \u201clike a real man would\u201d), new headquarters in Trump\u2019s home town and Washington-area residence (and Florida resort vicinity), and the Bezos-owned Washington Post featuring stories like \u201cImmigration Lawyers Suing for Apprentice tapes of Trump using the N-Word.\u201d Carell digs in to the part more than anywhere else on the episode, serenely jabbing at Trump being approximately 100 times less wealthy than he is, or how Trump\u2019s book is so heavy to ship because \u201cit has four Chapter 11s.\u201d (As the commercial chirpily concludes, \u201cThis has been a sick burn by Jeff Bezos.\u201d) Fair enough stuff. But, as with Jost\u2019s Update material, there\u2019s a simplistic sameness to the joke here as\u2014while Carell\u2019s Bezos glides over the fact that his new HQs are pleasing everyone \u201cexcept for the people who live there, and the people who live in all the places we didn\u2019t choose\u201d\u2014the pandering Trump-burning here ignores the parallel dynamic of two rich assholes screwing with people\u2019s lives for petty reasons. If people are going to clap at the idea of Bezos using the Post to attack Trump, it undermines the Post\u2019s actual journalism as just the grimy sniping of one said asshole at another. The crowd erupted in groans at the joke that Amazon\u2019s Arlington National Cemetery-adjacent HQ will allow the company to pay tribute to the nation\u2019s war dead \u201ceven when it\u2019s raining,\u201d but, well, Trump made such jokes fair game recently. It\u2019s just that satire works better (or at all) if it isn\u2019t deliberately or through laziness ignoring the whole picture. \n \n Advertisement \n \n I am hip to the musics of today \n \n Ella Mai has a pretty vibrato and some serviceable slow jams. Plus, she got to use the stage fog left over from Carell\u2019s sleepover sketch for her second number. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Most/Least Valuable (Not Ready For Prime Time) Player \n \n Seemingly not content to continue keeping Ego Nwodim on the bench, the episode actually reduced her in size, as she was one of the students in the ISS sketch, asking her question from a tiny box in the corner of the screen. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Nobody rose above this listless episode enough to warrant the top spot. Tough, but fair. \n \n \u201cWhat the hell is that thing?\u201d\u2014The Ten-To-Oneland Report \n \n After the space corn fiasco (which, for or because of its faults, should have been the last sketch), the \u201cGP Yass\u201d commercial that actually ended the show fizzled out badly. The joke that you can set your default GPS voice to \u201cdrag entertainer\u201d sort-of enchants car passengers Steve Carell and Heidi Gardner, who express enjoyment of the \u201csassy\u201d directions and traffic warnings with a square deadpan that aims for . . . something? Honestly, it feels like a cut-for-time piece that was only plugged in because the actual ten-to-one sketch crapped out so badly.

NBC \n \n Is there anything funnier than an unexpected corpse? Comedians have wrestled with the question since the dawn of time, or at least since Arsenic and Old Lace, but it wasn\u2019t until 2016 that Saturday Night Live found an answer: The only thing funnier than an unexpected corpse is the unexpected corpse of a parasailing instructor gently drifting back and forth with the currents outside the window of an underwater honeymoon suite. And this week, the show announced another scientific breakthrough: The only thing funnier than the unexpected corpse of a parasailing instructor gently drifting back and forth with the currents outside the window of an underwater honeymoon suite is the unexpected corpses of a bunch of flash-frozen monkeys plus one extremely dead cosmonaut, floating around gracefully in the zero-gravity environment of the International Space Station: \n \n It\u2019s hard to say if Taran Killam back in 2016 or Kate McKinnon this week did a better job of playing a dead body, but one thing is clear: they\u2019re fighting over third place, well behind the icicled monkey props featured in this sketch. Besides the monkeys, the other clear improvement in corpse-floating-outside-the-window technology is the addition of Steve Carell, who hosted this week. Carell has had an effortless command of the voice of bland, oblivious authority since his Daily Show days, and he puts it to great use here, particularly in the moment when he regains his composure after Snowpiercer-ing a monkey\u2019s arm. In retrospect, it\u2019s surprising that this is the first time Steve Carell has been asked to put a brave face on a space station full of dead monkeys for an audience of schoolchildren. Calling it now: It will not be the last. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n By Phil Helsel \n \n More fake news about the midterm blues. \"Saturday Night Live\" took to the airwaves to poke fun at conspiracy theories about voter fraud following the midterms, using a parody of conservative commentator Laura Ingraham\u2019s Fox News show. \n \n The sketch featured Kate McKinnon as Ingraham teasing an upcoming segment about how \"celebrities in California are whining about some tiny wildfires, while our heroic president is under constant attack \u2014 from rain.\" \n \n Cecily Strong played firebrand Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro warning about what McKinnon\u2019s Ingraham called \"rampant voter fraud that allowed Democrats to literally steal the election.\" \n \n \"Some have claimed that suburban women revolted against the Republican Party \u2014 but doesn\u2019t it feel more true that all Hispanics voted twice?\" McKinnon\u2019s Ingraham said. \"You can\u2019t dismiss that idea simply because it isn\u2019t true and sounds insane.\" \n \n More \"feel facts\" designed to pander to the stereotypical Fox News crowd followed, like \"Santa is Jesus's dad,\" \"blackface is a compliment\" and \"If the Earth is so warm, then why are my feet cold?\" \n \n Strong\u2019s Pirro offered up examples that included one person being able to impersonate many \u2014 holding up Eddie Murphy\u2019s \"Nutty Professor II: The Klumps\" \u2014 and a \"huge increase in what people call stacking, where multiple children will stack on top of each other, under a trench coat and then vote as an adult.\" (The segment later posted online by the show dropped the Murphy reference.) \n \n The sketch also lampooned parody advertisers on the faux-Fox show, including a fashion catheter company, the manufacturer of baptism kits for dogs and a brand of \"whites only\" eggs \u2014 \"it's just egg whites, and it\u2019s just for us.\" A parody of a derided real-life \"vape god\" segment also made an appearance. \n \n \"SNL\" was hosted by Steve Carell, the boss from the hit show \"The Office,\" who returned to host for the third time. \n \n He started his monologue by trying to talk about the movies he\u2019s been in since his TV role \u2014 only to be interrupted by former cast members Ed Helms, Jenna Fischer and Ellie Kemper, who pleaded with Carell to accept a reboot of the program. \n \n \"Do you remember the last words that Pam secretly whispered to Michael as she left for Denver?\" Fischer, who played Pam in the series, asked. \n \n When Carell responded he did not, Fischer replied: \"She said: \u2018Steve, don\u2019t be a d--k, do the reboot.\u201d \n \n The crowd cheered the suggestion, and Carell brought the actors on stage. But fans who expected a new series were left wanting: He instead said \"I am proud to announce, officially, that ... we have a great show tonight!\u201d (The band did play the theme song from the show). \n \n Carell hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" in 2005 and 2008. The musical guest Saturday was Ella Mai. ||||| Saturday Night Live saved its best Donald Trump jokes for guest host Steve Carell. \n \n While the latest episode's cold open sketch ripped Trump's favorite propaganda network, Fox News, Carell put on a bald cap and transformed himself into Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos. \n \n His three-minute message is ostensibly a broad overview of where Amazon is at now that its HQ2 locations in New York and northern Virginia have been selected. But really, this video is just an extended string of Trump burns, targeting his hair, his Twitter addiction, his bullying behavior, and his repeated failures as a businessman.",

Democracy is on the ballot. Justice is on the ballot. Good schools are on the ballot. Ending mass incarceration, that\u2019s on the ballot right now.\u201d \n \n Hope and change was his campaign slogan eight years ago. This year, Obama said, Trump presents a nightmarish vision of change that he urged the country to reject. \n \n \u201cHope is on the ballot,\u201d he said, laying out the choice. \u201cAnd fear is on the ballot too.\u201d \n \n Following Clinton on stage, Obama kicked off his remarks by taking on Trump\u2019s attempt to move away from his long history of raising doubts about the president\u2019s origins. \n \n \u201cIf there\u2019s an extra spring in my step tonight,\u201d Obama said, smiling. \u201cI am so relieved that the whole birther thing is over.\u201d \n \n Obama stressed that the issue isn\u2019t just birtherism\u2019s racism, but the kind of low-substance personality Trump has cultivated and brought to his campaign. \n \n \u201cISIL, North Korea, poverty, climate change \u2014 none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate,\u201d Obama said, in a tone dripping with sarcasm. \n \n \u201cTo think, that with just 124 days to go, just under the wire, we got that resolved. That\u2019s a boost for me in the home stretch,\u201d he laughed. \"In other breaking news, the world is round, not flat.\u201d \n \n But mostly, Obama raged. Boiling hotter than at his fall campaign launch event for Clinton in Philadelphia last week, he let loose at a candidate he presented as an existential threat to black America. \n \n The president sneered at Trump\u2019s supposed appeal to African-Americans, being delivered almost simultaneously at a campaign event in Colorado, as the Republican ticked through a list of endemic problems and finished, \u201cVote for Donald Trump, what do you have to lose? I will fix it.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe do have challenges,\u201d Obama said, rebutting him, \u201cbut we\u2019re not stupid.\u201d \n \n Trump, Obama said, tells people that African-Americans have never had it worse, holding a beat to let the meaning sink in that the Republican nominee is making that claim as the first black president finishes his second term. \n \n Trump \u201cmissed that whole civics lesson about slavery and Jim Crow,\u201d Obama said, giving a plug to the new Smithsonian African-American Museum opening on the Mall this week. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a museum for him to visit. So he can tune in.\u201d \n \n Using the museum\u2019s opening to launch into a consideration of the arc of African-American progress, he said people who say their vote doesn\u2019t count are an insult to the people who were beaten and killed registering voters during the civil rights movement. People who don\u2019t stand up for their community, he said, shame the memories of the slaves who suffered extra lashes for learning how to read. \n \n The job of everyone in the audience, Obama said, and everyone who cared, was to vote and to get more voters registered \u2014 not just to stop Trump, but to stop anyone who stands with him, and anyone who has backed voter ID laws targeted at suppressing black voters while pretending to chase a problem of mass voter fraud for which there is no evidence. \n \n The worst part of those laws, Obama said, is that they are often backed by the same people who stop any kind of gun control measures, which does hurt the black community. \n \n That, he said, shows that Republicans are \u201capparently more afraid of a ballot than a bullet.\u201d ||||| Washington (CNN) President Barack Obama delivered an impassioned plea to the African-American community Saturday night to help stop Donald Trump, saying he would consider it a \"personal insult\" to his legacy if black voters didn't turn out for Hillary Clinton. \n \n Addressing the Congressional Black Caucus gala for the last time as president, Obama warned that while his name would not be on the ballot in November, all of the progress that the country has made over the last eight years was on the line. \n \n \"If I hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn't matter who we elect -- read up on your history. It matters. We've got to get people to vote,\" Obama said. \"I will consider it a personal insult -- an insult to my legacy -- if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote.\" \n \n Obama's speech -- coming less than two months away from Election Day -- marked some of his harshest words yet about Trump, as well as his most forceful call on the black community to get behind Clinton. \n \n His remarks also had lighter moments -- particularly as he addressed the so-called \"birther\" controversy. The second-term president began his speech by remarking: \"There's an extra spring in my step tonight. I don't know about you guys, but I am so relieved that the whole 'birther' thing is over.\" \n \n Chuckling, the President said, \"I mean: ISIL, North Korea, poverty, climate change -- none of those things weighed on my mind like the validity of my birth certificate. And to think: that with just a 124 days to go, under the wire, we got that resolved.\" \n \n Obama was referring to Trump's admission this week that the president was born in the United States . Trump has long supported the birther theory, raising questions about Obama's birthplace and demanding that the president present his birth certificate as proof of his origin. \n \n Obama's tone, however, soon turned serious as he outlined what he said was at stake in the election. \n \n \"You may have heard Hillary's opponent in this election say that there's never been a worse time to be a black person. I mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery or Jim Crow,\" Obama said. \"But we've got a museum for him to visit, so he can tune in. We will educate him.\" \n \n In harsh rebuke of Trump, Obama referred to the businessman as \"somebody who has fought against civil rights and fought against equality and who has shown no regard for working people most of his life.\" \n \n On Trump's quest to win over African-American voters, Obama quipped: \"Well, we do have challenges, but we're not stupid.\" \n \n JUST WATCHED First lady Michelle Obama addresses birther controversy Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH First lady Michelle Obama addresses birther controversy 00:51 \n \n Clinton lauds Obama \n \n Speaking moments before the president, Clinton lauded Obama and also took on the birther controversy that has been swirling. \n \n \"Even when hateful nonsense is thrown their way, Barack, Michelle, their two beautiful daughters have represented our country with class, grace and integrity,\" said Clinton, who served as Obama's secretary of state. \n \n She added, \"Mr. President, not only do we know you are an American, you are a great American.\" \n \n Clinton, who accepted the group's \"Trailblazer Award\" on Saturday night for becoming the first female presidential candidate for a major political party, nodded to Trump when she said that the choice in November \"is not about golf course promotions or birth certificates, it comes down to who will fight for the forgotten.\" \n \n \"We can't let Barack Obama's legacy fall into the hands of someone who doesn't understand that, whose dangerous divisive vision for our country will drag us backwards,\" she said, though she never mentioned Trump's name. \n \n Obamas stumping for Clinton \n \n Clinton's campaign is relying on the Obamas to help persuade the coalition of minorities, young people and women who propelled them to the White House to cast ballots for this year's Democratic candidate. The President made his first solo appeal this week, appearing at a campaign rally in Philadelphia and phoning in to African-American radio to talk up Clinton. \n \n \"I get frustrated hearing folks say, 'You know, we're so excited with Barack, we love Michelle, they take Hillary for granted,'\" Obama told syndicated host Frankie Darcell. \"This is not a reality show. This is not something where it's all flash and fizzle.\" \n \n On Friday, First Lady Michelle Obama made her first campaign appearance of 2016, trying to convince her and her husband's supporters at a Virginia rally that Clinton is also worthy of their votes. \n \n \"When I hear folks saying they're not inspired this this election, I disagree.

Canada will never be intimidated,\" Prime Minister Stephen Harper vowed in an address to the nation. \n \n Unfolding just before 10 a.m., while lawmakers were meeting in caucus rooms, the assault rocked Parliament over and over with the boom of gunfire, led MPs to barricade doors with chairs and sent people streaming from the building in fear. Harper was addressing a caucus when the attack began outside the door, but he safely escaped. \n \n Investigators offered little information about the gunman, identified as 32-year-old petty criminal Michael Zehaf-Bibeau. But Harper said: \"In the days to come we will learn about the terrorist and any accomplices he may have had.\" \n \n A government official told AP that Zehaf-Bibeau was a recent convert to Islam. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the case publicly. \n \n Canada was already on alert because of a deadly hit-and-run assault Monday against two Canadian soldiers by a man Harper described as an \"ISIL-inspired terrorist.\" ISIL, or Islamic State, has called for reprisals against Canada and other Western countries that have joined the U.S.-led air campaign against the extremist group in Iraq and Syria. \n \n Witnesses said the soldier posted at the National War Memorial, identified as Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, was gunned down at point-blank range by a man carrying a rifle and dressed all in black, his face half-covered with a scarf. The gunman appeared to raise his arms in triumph, then entered Parliament, a few hundred yards away, where dozens of shots soon rang out, according to witnesses. \n \n People fled the complex by scrambling down scaffolding erected for renovations, while others took cover inside as police with rifles and body armor took up positions outside and cordoned off the normally bustling streets around Parliament. \n \n On Twitter, Canada's justice minister and other government officials credited 58-year-old sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers with shooting the attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms. Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial hat. \n \n At least three people were treated for minor injuries. \n \n In Washington, President Barack Obama condemned the shootings as \"outrageous\" and said: \"We have to remain vigilant.\" The U.S. Embassy in Ottawa was locked down as a precaution, and security was tightened at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery just outside Washington. \n \n Harper vowed that the attacks will \"lead us to strengthen our resolve and redouble our efforts\" to keep the country safe and work with Canada's allies to fight terrorists. \n \n Police said in the initial hours that as many as two other gunmen may have taken part in the attacks. But by late in the evening, the cordon around Parliament was lifted and police said there was no longer any threat to the public in the area. \n \n Court records that appear to be the gunman's show that he had a long rap sheet, with a string of convictions for assault, robbery, drug and weapons offenses, and other crimes. \n \n Tony Zobl said he witnessed the Canadian soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor window directly above the National War Memorial, a 70-foot, arched granite cenotaph, or tomb, with bronze sculptures commemorating World War I. \n \n \"I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honor guard in front of the cenotaph point-blank, twice,\" Zobl told the Canadian Press news agency. \"The honor guard dropped to the ground, and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.\" \n \n The Canadian Broadcasting Corp. had video of the gunman going to his car alone with his weapon after the shooting at the memorial. The car was later spotted parked in front of Parliament Hill, just down the block. \n \n Cabinet minister Tony Clement tweeted that at least 30 shots were heard inside Parliament, where Conservative and Liberal MPs were holding their weekly caucus meetings. \n \n \"I'm safe locked in a office awaiting security,\" Kyle Seeback, another member of Parliament, tweeted. \n \n \"I was just taking off my jacket to go into caucus. I hear this pop, pop, pop. Possibly 10 shots, don't really know. Thought it was dynamite or construction rather than anything else,\" said John McKay, a member of Parliament. \n \n He said security guards then came rushing down the halls, herding them toward the back of the buildings. \n \n \"And then we started talking to another woman and she was apparently inside the library of Parliament, saw the fellow, wearing a hoodie, carrying a gun,\" McKay said, \"and then the implications of this start to sink in.\" \n \n The attack came two days after a recent convert to Islam killed one Canadian soldier and injured another with his car before being shot to death by police. The killer had been on the radar of federal investigators, who feared he had jihadist ambitions and seized his passport when he tried to travel to Turkey. \n \n Canada had raised its domestic terror threat level from low to medium Tuesday because of what it called \"an increase in general chatter from radical Islamist organizations.\" As recently as Tuesday, Canada sent eight fighter jets to the Mideast to join the battle against Islamic State. \n \n After the shootings, officials canceled two events in Toronto honoring Pakistani teenager and Nobel laureate Malala Yousafzai, including one in which she was supposed to receive honorary Canadian citizenship. She was shot in the head by a Taliban gunman in 2012 for supporting schooling for girls. \n \n ___ \n \n Gillies reported from Toronto.

The suspect in that case was killed by police after brief chase. \n \n Harper said more information about the \u201cterrorist\u201d killed in Ottawa will surface in the coming days. CTV News has confirmed that the suspect in Wednesday\u2019s attack is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a Canadian citizen born in 1982. \n \n \u201cThis week\u2019s events are a grim reminder that Canada is not immune to the types of terrorist attacks we have seen elsewhere around the world,\u201d the prime minister said. \n \n \u201cWe are also reminded that attacks on our security personnel and on our institutions of governments are by their very nature attacks on our country, on our values, on our society, on us Canadians as a free and democratic people who embrace human dignity for all,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cBut let there be no misunderstanding -- we will not be intimidated. Canada will never be intimidated.\u201d \n \n Harper said the attacks will only strengthen Canada\u2019s resolve and lead the government to \u201credouble our efforts and those of our national security agencies to take all necessary steps to identify and counter threats and keep Canada safe here at home.\u201d \n \n National Defence Minister Rob Nicholson echoed Harper in a statement issued late Wednesday, saying that Canada\u2019s deployments in Iraq as part of the U.S.-led fight against ISIS \u201cwill continue unimpeded.\u201d \n \n The prime minister offered his condolences to the friends and family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo, the reservist who was \u201cmurdered in cold blood\u201d Wednesday while standing guard at the war memorial. Harper also praised the passersby and first responders who tried to save his life. \n \n Opposition Leader Thomas Mulcair called the shootings \"a cowardly attack designed to strike at the heart of our democracy, the heart of who we are.\" \n \n But he said Canadians will once again wake up in a country \u201cblessed by love, diversity and peace.\u201d \n \n RCMP Commissioner Bob Paulson said Thursday that Zehaf-Bibeau had applied for a passport, and police were doing background checks. Zehaf-Bibeau was not on the list of \u201chigh-risk travellers\u201d being tracked by Canadian authorities, Paulson said. \n \n Court records show that a Michael Joseph Zehaf-Bibeau was accused of robbery in Vancouver in late 2011. He was found guilty of uttering threats, a lesser charge. \n \n Panic on the Hill \n \n The chaos in Ottawa began around 9:52 a.m. Wednesday, when police received multiple 911 calls about a shooting at the National War Memorial. \n \n When paramedics and police arrived, the honour guard -- later identified as Cirillo -- was on the ground, surrounded by people who tried to help him. \n \n A short time later, the gunman entered Parliament\u2019s Centre Block and dozens ofshots rang out as MPs, staff and reporters rushed to safety. The suspect was gunned down by Kevin Vickers, the sergeant-at-arms for the House of Commons. \n \n Three other people were taken to the Ottawa Hospital after the shootings. They were all discharged by Wednesday evening. \n \n Parliament Hill and Ottawa\u2019s downtown core were under lockdown for hours after the shootings, but police have not said if other suspects were still on the loose. \n \n Ottawa Police Chief Charles Bordeleau said residents need to stay \u201cvigilant\u201d and report any suspicious activity to police. But he did not directly answer questions from reporters about the possibility that another shooter -- or shooters -- were still at large. \n \n Earlier Wednesday, Ottawa police Const. Marc Soucy said officers believe there may be more than one assailant. He said that police will be assuming that any other assailants are armed. \n \n Tony Zobl, 35, told The Canadian Press that he witnessed the soldier being gunned down from his fourth-floor office window directly above the war memorial. \n \n \"I looked out the window and saw a shooter, a man dressed all in black with a kerchief over his nose and mouth and something over his head as well, holding a rifle and shooting an honour guard in front of the Cenotaph point-blank, twice,\" Zobl told CP. \n \n \"It looked like the honour guard was trying to reach for the barrel of the gun. The honour guard dropped to the ground and the shooter kind of raised his arms in triumph holding the rifle.\" \n \n Zobl said he then saw the shooter run up the street toward Parliament Hill. \n \n Video captured inside Parliament showed officers filing down the empty corridor of the Hall of Honour as at least a dozen shots could be heard ringing out in the background. A security guard was reported to be injured in the shooting. \n \n \u201cThis is a dynamic and unfolding situation,\u201d RCMP Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud told a news conference Wednesday afternoon. \n \n He said the attack caught the RCMP by surprise, but would not elaborate. \n \n \u201cIf we had known that this was coming, we would have been able to disrupt it,\u201d he said. \n \n The RCMP also said it\u2019s too early to say if the gunman was among the 90 or so suspected extremists being tracked by the Canadian government. \n \n Reports of a third shooting inside the Rideau Centre, a shopping mall near Parliament Hill, turned out to be false, Bordeleau said. \n \n \u201cToday is a sad and tragic day for our city and our country,\u201d Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said, adding that everyone is \u201clooking for answers.\u201d \n \n The shooting comes two days after a man attacked two Canadian soldiers in St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Que. One of those soldiers, Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent, died from his injuries. The suspect, Martin Couture-Rouleau, was shot and killed by police. \n \n On Tuesday, Canada raised the domestic terror threat level from low to medium. \n \n Security beefed up \n \n The attack on Parliament Hill immediately prompted officials across the country to heighten security at government buildings, provincial legislatures and military bases. \n \n Soldiers are also being cautioned about wearing their uniforms in public when they\u2019re not on active duty. \n \n U.S. President Barack Obama spoke with Harper Wednesday and offered \u201cany assistance\u201d needed in the response to the attack, according to a tweet from the U.S. National Security Council. \n \n Obama also expressed \u201cthe American people\u2019s solidarity with Canada,\u201d according to the NSC. \n \n The president later publicly condemned the Ottawa shootings, calling them \u201coutrageous.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re all shaken by it,\u201d he said, adding that the U.S. is closely watching the unfolding events. \n \n A statement from NATO\u2019s secretary general also said that \u201cNATO stands in solidarity with our ally Canada at this difficult time.\u201d \n \n With files from Marlene Leung and The Canadian Press \n \n An earlier version of this story Wednesday incorrectly reported that Zehaf-Bibeau was on a list of \u201chigh-risk travellers\u201d being tracked by Canadian authorities and had his passport seized. \n \n Live updates and commentary: \n \n On mobile?

Grannik said that was a \"life sentence,\" according to KTVA. \n \n The criminal complaint said the victim, who did not know Schneider, told police she was at a gas station when he offered to give her a ride. The woman, who was attempting to get to her boyfriend's home, accepted.

He pleaded guilty to a single felony assault charge in the second degree in exchange for a sentence of two years with one suspended, plus three years probation. Schneider received credit for time served while wearing an ankle monitor and living with his wife and two children. \n \n \"I would just like to emphasize how grateful I am for this process,\" Schneider said, not mentioning the impact on the victim, KTVA reported. \"It has given me a year to really work on myself and become a better person, and a better husband, and a better father, and I'm very eager to continue that journey.\" \n \n Judge Michael Corey accepted the deal, noting the outcome of the case could be described as \"breathtaking.\" He said his decision was based on the prospect of rehabilitation. \n \n He also told Schneider, \"This can never happen again.\" \n \n The victim was not in court. \n \n Grannik said he tried to tell her about the hearing but could not reach her. ||||| A criminal complaint against Schneider, written by APD Detective Brett Sarber, said that the victim had been at the Holiday gas station at Minnesota Drive and Spenard Road, looking for a ride toward Muldoon. A man later identified as Schneider pulled up in a white SUV, introduced himself as \u201cDan\u201d and claimed he knew the victim; he offered her a ride, which she accepted. \n \n \u201c(The victim) said that she had never met the man in her life prior to this encounter, and nothing else about their encounter involved drugs, sex or money, or sex for money,\u201d Sarber wrote. \n \n Instead of heading to Muldoon, the driver said he had to get something from another car and drove to the area of 36th Avenue and Turnagain Street, where they were stopped by road construction. A construction worker in the area later remembered Schneider, the victim and the SUV when police asked about them. \n \n Schneider then stopped the SUV on 36th east of Wisconsin Street, and asked the victim to get out while he loaded items into the vehicle. Once she approached the rear of the vehicle, Sarber wrote, Schneider \u201cfull on tackled\u201d her, shoving her to the ground. He then began to strangle her with both hands around her throat, telling her that he was going to kill her. \n \n \"She said she could not fight him off, he was too heavy and had her down being choked to death,\" Sarber wrote. \"(The victim) said she lost consciousness, thinking she was going to die.\" \n \n When the victim woke up, she told police, Schneider was rising from her and zipping up his pants. He offered her a tissue, which police later recovered as evidence. \n \n \"The man told her that he wasn't really going to kill her, that he needed her to believe she was going to die so that he could be sexually fulfilled,\" Sarber wrote. \n \n The victim said Schneider also let her retrieve her backpack and cellphone from the SUV's front seat. Sarber said she used the phone to call police and report the vehicle's license-plate number the moment Schneider drove out of sight.",

Exactly who owns it is the subject of a federal lawsuit filed in San Francisco that reads like an Isaac Asimov sci-fi tale. \n \n A Novato man says it\u2019s rightfully his. A Massachusetts couple say they paid the Novato man $425,000 for it and that it\u2019s rightfully theirs. \n \n The Novato man says he canceled the sale when he found out the Massachusetts couple were running a rock museum in Maine. The Massachusetts couple say the Novato man canceled the sale because of seller\u2019s remorse, when he figured he let the $425,000 rock go on the cheap. \n \n Meanwhile, a New York rock broker and two Kansas rock polishers say they\u2019re entitled to a piece of the action, too. \n \n LATEST SFGATE VIDEOS Now Playing: Now Playing 4:20 pm on 4/20 at Hippie Hill Ted Andersen, SFGATE \n \n The Waldos at 4:20 p.m. on 4/20 David Downs \n \n Interview with the Waldos on 4/20 David Downs \n \n 'Blindspotting' trailer San Francisco Chronicle \n \n Cannabis revelers descend on Hippie Hil Paul Chinn, The Chronicle \n \n The real meaning of 420 Alix Martichoux / SFGATE \n \n Coast Guard search and rescue Ted Andersen, SFGATE \n \n Emeryville Police release video of robbery suspects San Francisco Chronicle \n \n 1906 Earthquake commemoration Douglas Zimmerman, SFGate \n \n Audio: Southwest Flight 1380 emergency landing via Broadcastify \n \n The tale begins 4 billion years ago, give or take an eon, when the meteorite plummeted to earth and landed in the Gobi Desert of China. In 2000, it was discovered, and pieces of it began to be sold to well-heeled rock hounds, one of whom was Stephan Settgast of Novato, who said he bought a 220-pound slice of it in 2004. \n \n In 2014, court documents say, Settgast agreed to sell the slice to Lawrence Stifler and Mary McFadden of Brookline, Mass., who paid him $425,000 through a New York meteorite middleman. \n \n But after the rock polishers, Keith and Dana Jenkerson of Osawatomie, Kan., who had been hired to spiff up the meteorite for its new owners, said they thought it was worth perhaps $1 million, Settgast decided he wanted his rock back, the Massachusetts couple say. \n \n Settgast went to the Jenkersons\u2019 studio and, while they were away at a rock show, entered the premises and took back the meteorite. It was a clear case of meteorite-napping, said the spurned buyers. \n \n Settgast maintained he was reclaiming the rock because the couple planned to put it on public display at their under-construction museum in Maine. Settgast said that violated the terms of the sale. Stifler and McFadden said a no-museum promise was never part of the deal. They say Settgast has their rock and their money, too. \n \n Settgast sued in federal court in February to invalidate the sale and keep the rock. Stifler and McFadden countersued in March to get their hands on the rock. \n \n Nobody knows what a one-of-a-kind meteorite is worth, according to Settgast\u2019s lawyer, Curt Edmondson. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a Toyota,\u201d he said. \n \n Edmondson denied that Settgast stole back the meteorite or planned to keep the money. He said Settgast had never formally turned over the meteorite, despite being paid for it, and was entitled to take it back because it was still his. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not like he went to Kansas and jimmied the lock on the back door and put a 220-pound rock under his arm,\u201d Edmondson said. \n \n Court documents suggest one reason the rock polishers valued the rock at $1 million is that they believed they were entitled to 5 percent of its value for their services. They were seeking $50,000 for spiffing it up, instead of the $20,000 they had been promised and eventually accepted. \n \n Rock hounds say rare meteorites of the Fukang variety, known as pallasites, are beautiful and valuable but not particularly scientifically significant. \n \n \u201cThis kind of meteorite has been studied and has little new to tell us,\u201d said Paul Doherty, senior scientist at the Exploratorium in San Francisco. \u201cIt came from the core-mantle boundary of an asteroid. We have studied lots of meteorites of this kind. It doesn\u2019t need to be in a museum. If it was a Martian meteorite, that would be different.\u201d \n \n Settgast, Stifler and McFadden did not return calls seeking comment. A federal judge has scheduled a hearing on the dispute for June 29. \n \n Steve Rubenstein is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Date unknown. \n \n A gold-flecked meteorite that has traveled from the asteroid belt near Mars to the mountains of Fukang, China, and finally Marin County, California, is at the center of a vicious ownership battle being waged in federal court. \n \n The 227-pound iron \"pallasite\" meteorite is estimated to be 4.5 billion years old. First discovered in Fukang, China about 15 years ago, it could be worth as much as $1 million, according to Stephen Settgast, an asteroid collecter who claims he's the rightful owner. \n \n He sued a museum in Maine and a New York meteorite expert in February alleging breach of contract over the sale of the meteorite. But they have now filed a counterclaim, alleging that Settgast, who is staying in Marin County, is behind a \"blatant theft of a unique and precious meteorite.\" \n \n The countersuit alleges Settgast sold the meteorite for $425,000, then engaged in an \"outrageous act of seller\u2019s remorse\" by stealing back the space rock for himself. \n \n \"This isn't a typical theft,\" said Wayne Minckley, undersheriff in Miami County, Kansas, in a Skype interview with NBC Bay Area. \n \n A sheriff is involved in the out-of-this-world case because authorities aren\u2019t yet ready to decide who stole the meteorite until the suit is settled. \n \n \"It\u2019s a complicated case in the mere fact that the individual who sold it to the folks in Maine is our suspect in the theft,\" Minckley said. \n \n Settgast would not speak on the record. But his attorney, Curt Edmonson of the Oregon firm, Slinde Nelson Stanford, said this is a simple business dispute gone awry. \n \n \"Civil suits don\u2019t use terms like \u2018steal.' That\u2019s a criminal term,\" he said. \"We didn\u2019t go over the top in our complaint, but they certainly went over the top in their counterclaims.\" \n \n But Settgast's story is full of holes, according to the founders of the Maine Mineral and Gem Museum \u2014 Lawrence Stifler and Mary McFadden of Brookline, Massachusetts \u2014 and meteorite expert Darryl Pitt, of New York. All three filed the counterclaim on March 29. \n \n In the suit, Jeff Valle, the trio's Los Angeles attorney, laid out his clients\u2019 argument like this: Noted for his ability to spot beauty and value in meteorites, Pitt suggested to the museum founders that they buy the meteorite in question. Stifler and McFadden agreed to pay Settgast $425,000 to feature the \"Fukang meteorite\" in their museum, which is not yet open. \n \n In August 2014, Pitt brokered the deal with Settgast. The final of three payments was made in February 2015, the counterclaim contends. According to his website biography, Pitt is the purveyor of the \"world's foremost collection of aesthetic iron meteorites,\" which he describes as \"extraterrestrial objects d'art.\" \n \n Valle and Pitt have declined to be interviewed. \n \n Keith Jenkerson, of KD Meteorites, gives a thumbs up after nearly completing his work on the \"Fukang meteorite.\" Date unknown. \n \n Photo credit: Courtesy of Maine Mineral And Gem Museum \n \n After the money was paid, Pitt and the museum founders waited for the meteorite to be cleaned up and prepared by Kansas duo Keith and Dana Jenkerson, of KD Meteorites. The couple's website twinkles with brightly lit stars and boasts they've been \"chasing meteorites since 1990s.\" \n \n The Jenkersons took almost two years to stabilize, restore and prepare the \"Fukang meteorite,\" the countersuit alleges, and on Jan. 10, Keith Jenkerson told Pitt this was \"one of the most awesome meteorites to ever be displayed.\" He guessed the spiffed-up space rock to now be worth $1 million. But Pitt and the museum founders said this higher price is wildly inflated, the counterclaim states. \n \n Less than two weeks later, the meteorite was reported stolen. \n \n Pitt and the museum founders allege that Settgast, whose lawyer described him as a \"world-renowned\" fossil hunter who also has a ranch in Montana, went into the Jenkersons' lab on Jan. 23 and stole back the meteorite. Settgast's attorneys claim a condition of the sale was that the meteorite couldn't be shown in a public museum, a point the museum founders' say is simply not true, the counterclaim contends. \n \n How Settgast would have gotten the meteorite out of the lab, at the Jenkersons' home in Osawatomie, Kansas, without detection, and then to Marin County, where Settgast has been living with a relative, has not been clearly explained. \n \n Minckley, from the sheriff\u2019s office, reiterated that it\u2019s his understanding Settgast stole the meteorite from the lab. He said there was no surveillance video to document what might have happened. His office, however, is reserving a final determination on whether a crime was committed, and by whom, until a federal judge makes a ruling on who really owns the meteorite. \n \n As for why the sheriff\u2019s department is letting the civil case play out first, Edmonson said: \"That tells you a little bit about how they feel about the criminal action. If they don\u2019t feel there is enough evidence for the claim of theft, then it\u2019s not there.\" \n \n A hearing is set for June to be heard by Oakland-based U.S District Court Judge Saundra Brown Armstrong.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The question of who owns a particular chunk of a famed meteorite is heading to federal court with the filing of a lawsuit and countersuit, SF Gate reports. It all started billions of years ago with the Fukang meteorite slammed into China's Gobi Desert. Fast-forward to the year 2000: when the meteorite was discovered and collectors began acquiring slices of it. Among them was Stephan Settgast, currently of California, who says he bought his 220-pound piece in 2004. In 2014, according to court documents, Settgast agreed to sell it to Lawrence Stifler and Mary McFadden of Massachusetts for $425,000. And then it all went bad. Settgast says the couple violated the conditions of the sale by planning to show it in their rock museum. They say not showing the meteorite was never a condition of the sale and suggest that Settgast got \"seller's remorse\" after learning he might have undervalued it. And, they allege, that remorse manifested in what they call the \"outrageous act\" of Settgast stealing back the rock from the studio of a pair of Kansas rock polishers who spent two years preparing the stone for the buyers, per NBC News. After all, the rock polishers did tell Settgast the meteorite could fetch up to $1 million (which, documents point out, would bump up their 5% fee to $50,000). How the alleged theft of the gold-flecked meteorite actually went down is unclear. Settgast filed a suit in February alleging breach of contract. Stifler, McFadden, and Darryl Pitt, the meteorite expert who brokered the deal, countersued last month. Local authorities in Kansas say they are going to hang back on pursuing Settgast for theft until a federal judge determines who owns the meteorite. \"This isn't a typical theft,\" Miami County undersheriff tells NBC. (No one noticed this meteor the size of a large living room plowing into the earth.)",

But when they enter Mr. Offield's English class, the phones get locked into little bags, which can't be opened until class is over. \n \n \"By separating something that's primarily for their social life, I'm hoping that it brings them more in the moment,\" Offield said. \n \n Graham Dugoni is the founder of the startup company, Yondr, that makes the bags. He's attempting to break cellphone addiction and \"help people engage with each other in a real way.\" \n \n \"What it symbolizes is a movement, and the bag is just the tool,\" Dugoni said. \n \n The Yondr pouch locks much like a security tag in a clothing store. If someone needs to access their phone, they can choose to leave the phone-free zone, reports CBS News correspondent John Blackstone. \n \n Dugoni first introduced the bags at nightclubs in tech-centric San Francisco. \"Sometimes you see someone come in and their shoulders are uptight, they're clutching their phone like it's a baby,\" Dugoni said. \"You can read it on their face - they're saying, 'don't take my phone away.'\" \n \n It's a new movement challenging the pervasive habit of viewing the world through the screen of a smartphone. \n \n The Yondr bags are now mandatory for everyone attending a performance by comedian Dave Chappelle. \n \n \"We've had a strict 'no cellphone' rule for years. Obviously, if you look on YouTube, you'll see very few people adhere to it,\" Chapelle said. \n \n Before the bags, Chappelle often found himself telling jokes to people distracted by their devices. \n \n \"It would be very hard for you to talk to anybody if he was doing this the whole time you're talking,\" he said, pulling a phone out of his pocket. \n \n Dugoni hopes to see the bags used in arenas that seat as many as 20,000. \n \n \"After the first five minutes, there's twitchy hands and looking for their phones, then they seem to forget about it and slip into that natural mode of interaction. And that's kind of the golden moment,\" Dugoni said. \n \n Back at Mercy High, administrator Summer Dittmer admits to having phone separation anxiety. \n \n \"I walked into a club, they asked for my phone, I said no. They said, 'you need to put your phone in here or you're not going to see anything happening in the venue.' So they gave me the thing, put my phone in, put it in my purse,\" Dittmer recalled. \"It was almost like being separated from your own limb, but in the end, I remembered more than I typically do at a concert.\" \n \n Drivers blame \"addiction\" for phone use while driving \n \n That experience prompted her to lease the bags for her school. For senior Ally Ick, locking her phone up was a mental adjustment. \n \n \"Maybe if there's something going on on social media, I could be really tempted to want to check my phone every second, but then with the Yonder pouches, it takes away that feeling and you don't have to worry about it so much,\" Ick said. \n \n Junior Daniela Clinton had to bag her phone for three days on a school retreat. \n \n \"I could hear it vibrating, but I couldn't grab it and use it. I hated it so much,\" Clinton said. But she adjusted. \"It was a break from reality. I completely forgot about everything - even school - and that was nice.\" \n \n But not everyone is ready to let go of their electronic addictions. One Dave Chappelle audience member was caught red-handed. \n \n \"Just to be clear, you're no longer welcome in the venue while Dave's performing here,\" security told him. \n \n \"I understand why everybody uses their phones and why people are addicted to this technology.

The huge vessel, perhaps 50m from bow to stern, was sailing from Asia Minor to Rome in 1BC when it foundered near the tiny island between Crete and the Peloponnese. \n \n The project team, from the Greek Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities and Lund University in Sweden, discovered the buried arm with a bespoke underwater metal detector which has revealed the presence of other large metal objects nearby under the seabed. \u201cThere should be at least seven statues,\u201d Alexandros Sotiriou, a Greek technical diver on the team told the Guardian.

Until those results are published, the person is known as Pamphilos after divers found the name, meaning \u201cfriend of all\u201d, carved on a buried cup that had been decorated with an erotic scene. \n \n The Antikythera wreck first came to light in 1900 when Greek sponge divers happened on the scene in 50 metres of water. Archaeologists have since pulled up spectacular bronze and marble statues, ornate glass and pottery, stunning pieces of jewellery, and a remarkable geared device \u2013 the Antikythera mechanism \u2013 which modelled the motion of the heavens. During the 2017 excavations, divers recovered a bronze disc that may be a missing part of the ancient device. \n \n But it is the statues that made the wreck famous. In the 1900s, archaeologists working at the site surfaced pieces of a beautiful Hellenistic bronze, named the Antikythera Youth. The statue now stands in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens alongside an impressive bronze head named the Antikythera philosopher, also hauled from the wreck. Both date to the 4th century BC, raising the question of how they came to be aboard the ill-fated ship 300 years later. \n \n Jens Daehner, associate curator of antiquities at the J Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, said the Antikythera wreck had already yielded significant bronze statues. \u201cThe chance to recover another group of lifesize statues associated with the wreck is extraordinary, because bronzes are usually encountered randomly under the sea, picked up by fishing nets or chanced upon by divers,\u201d he said. \u201cThose finds are not excavated like at Antikythera, where archaeologists can and do document the entire context, which provides all the sorts of very valuable data as to when the sculptures were transported and why they were on the ship: for trade, as booty, or as scrap metal to be recycled.\u201d \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest As well as the arm, divers have recovered a patterned slab of red marble the size of a tea tray, a silver tankard, sections of joined wood from the ship\u2019s frame and a human bone. Photograph: Brett Seymour/EUA/ARGO 2017 \n \n The bronze recycling industry was huge in classical times and later in the medieval period, leading to the destruction of countless statues and other artefacts that would be priceless today. For this reason, many of the finest specimens of bronze statues that survive were once lost at sea. \u201cAncient bronze sculpture in general is rare due to the metal having been recycled in antiquity and later. We think of the ones from the sea as those that got away,\u201d said Daehner. \u201cAny chance to recover more Greek sculptures in any medium, but particularly in bronze, should not be missed.\u201d \n \n To recover the statues will take a massive effort. The divers must first remove boulders that are in their way, either by hauling them up, or by drilling holes in the rocks and filling them with grout that expands to fracture the stone. Another option is to crack the boulders open with small shaped charges that technical divers use to rescue people trapped when undersea caves collapse. But even if the statues can be lifted from the sea, they will be broken and need costly and time-consuming conservation and reconstruction. \n \n Statues are not the only objects the excavators hope to find. The latest excavations uncovered a lump of material bearing a bronze disc that matches the size of geared wheels found in the Antikythera mechanism. Wound by a handle, the device showed the movement of the sun, moon and planets in the sky, but not all of the machine was recovered. \u201cThe disc looks very exciting indeed,\u201d said Andrew Ramsey, a CT specialist at Nikon Metrology in Tring, who used CT scans to read inscriptions on the original pieces of the mechanism. But the disc may be something entirely different. Preliminary x-ray images reveal no teeth, but an image of a bull, suggesting the disc is not a cog but a decorative item. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Divers also discovered this piece of material bearing a bronze disc that matches the size of geared wheels found in the Antikythera mechanism. Photograph: Brett Seymour/EUA/ARGO 2017 \n \n Mike Edmunds, emeritus professor of astrophysics at Cardiff University and a member of the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project, said the findings are impressive. \u201cThey are getting very good at detecting bronze items which raises the possibility that they may be able to find either the missing planetary gearing from the Antikythera mechanism, which we know is there from the analysis of the inscriptions on the mechanism, or a new piece of mechanism, or another mechanism that was being transported, and that would be very exciting.\u201d \n \n The team will return to the wreck in the spring, optimistic that they may pull up fresh treasures from the wreck. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be just the bronze sculptures,\u201d said Foley. \u201cWe\u2019re down in the hold of the ship now, so all the other things that would have been carried should be down there as well. Every day is going to be like opening Tut\u2019s tomb.\u201d ||||| A trove of new artifacts have been recovered from the Roman-era wreck that yielded the mysterious Antikythera Mechanism, including an arm made of bronze and a strange metal disc. But most intriguing of all, the latest survey suggests that seven bronze statues are still waiting to be discovered. \n \n The Antikythera shipwreck is the gift that keeps on giving. \n \n The latest expedition, led by the Greek Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities, Lund University, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, was conducted between September 4 to 20, and as per previous trips to the wreck, the team did not leave disappointed. With excellent weather conditions above them, the divers managed to recover an \u201corphaned\u201d right arm of a bronze statue, pottery shards, nails, lead sheathing fragments, and an odd metal disc, among other artifacts. \n \n Excitingly, scans with a metal detector indicated the presence of at least seven undiscovered and priceless bronze statues buried near the sunken ship, which sank off the Greek island of Antikythera in 1 BC. The doomed vessel was filled with art pieces and luxury items, including the Antikythera Mechanism\u2014a geared device used to predict astronomical events such as eclipses and the movements of the Sun, Moon, and planets. The 50-foot-long Roman-era ship sunk near the tiny island between Crete and Peloponnese. \n \n Prior to this latest expedition, the Return to Antikythera project team managed to recover glassware, luxury ceramics, anchors, counterweights, tools, and even an ancient skeleton (which is currently being analyzed for DNA). During the recently concluded trip to the wreck, divers investigated areas where fragments of marble and bronze statues had been found before, and which were located near and underneath large stone boulders. Regrettably, the wreck happens to be located on a slope, and over the years, a succession of earthquakes has delivered numerous rocks and boulders to the site. \n \n Advertisement \n \n One of the more interesting items pulled from the wreck is a sediment-encrusted metal disc measuring about eight centimeters across, and with four metal arms with holes for pins. \n \n At first glance, the archaeologists thought it might be related to the Antikythera Mechanism, specifically a missing gear that was likely used to calculate the positions of the planets. But after performing an x-ray analysis of the disc, the researchers realized it wasn\u2019t a gear at all, but some kind of decorative object adorned with the image of a bull. They suspect it was attached to the shield of a statue, or even to the ship itself. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The researchers also found part of a bronze robe or toga, fragments of the ship-shell (namely bits of the skeletal frame and planking), and a bare leg attached to a base that was lodged underneath a boulder. The discovery of the bronze arm, plus the metal detector findings, boosts the number of bronze statues suspected to reside at the site. \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n \u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is these sculptures are in among and under the boulders,\u201d explained team member Brendan Foley to The Guardian. \u201cWe think it means a minimum of seven, and potentially nine, bronze sculptures still waiting for us down there.\u201d \n \n \n \n Bronze statues are exceptionally rare, with only about 50 known to reside from this period. During both the classical and medieval eras, bronze recycling was an important industry\u2014one that resulted in the destruction of countless statues and other artifacts that would, by today\u2019s standards, be priceless. Ironically, some of the finest bronze relics from this era were recovered from shipwrecks. \n \n \n \n Once these suspected bronze statues are located, a truly herculean effort will be required to pull them out. The archaeologists have several options, including hauling the rocks up or fracturing them into smaller pieces. Regardless, it\u2019ll be a slow, costly, and tedious process. The next expedition is planned for the spring of 2018, at which time the archaeologists plan to explore the hold of the sunken ship. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Which, whoa. \n \n [Return to Antikythera Mission, Guardian] ||||| See Statues and Mysterious Disk Found in Ancient Greek Shipwreck WATCH: The site made famous by the Antikythera mechanism continues to yield fascinating discoveries. ALSO: There's additional footage from the expedition at the end of the article. \n \n Bronze limbs, a sarcophagus lid, marble statue pieces, and a mysterious bronze disk were among the remains found during excavations of one of the world's most ancient\u2014and famous\u2014shipwrecks. \n \n Greece's Division of Underwater Antiquities\u2014a government agency that's part of the country's ministry of archaeology\u2014announced their finds Wednesday after several weeks of excavations, which lasted from September 4 to 20. Located just off the coast of the Greek island of Antikythera 180 feet below the sea, the so-called Antikythera shipwreck can yield insights into Roman culture during its heyday. \n \n \"[Marine archaeologists] have found a very big treasure of statues of marble and bronze and other items,\" said expedition co-leader Aggeliki Simossi. \n \n According to Simossi, the first century B.C. merchant ship would have been bound for Rome, where wealthy members of Roman society decorated their villas with Grecian art. Large for its time, the ship measured roughly 130 feet long, meaning a large stash of artifacts was on board when it set sail for Italy. \n \n Video taken during the excavation shows the archaeologists pulling a realistic sculpture fragment of an arm from the elbow to the fingers. The open tilt of some of the statues' hands, with fingers seeming to gesture up and outward, suggest they were modeled after philosophers. \n \n While the statues would likely have been considered high art in their day, perhaps the most intriguing artifact found is a small, bronze disk. Punctuated with holes and decorated with the image of a bull, it's unclear what the disk was used for, said Simossi. \n \n Watch how a team of marine archaeologists excavated the ancient ship and (at minute seven) uncovered its mysterious remains. \n \n \"It is maybe decoration for furniture or maybe a seal, or it could be an instrument,\" she said. \"It is very early to say.\" \n \n It's also reminiscent of the Antikythera mechanism, a small, bronze disk that measures celestial movements with impressive accuracy. That piece was found among the ship's remains in 2006. The mechanism is so accurate, in fact, that it's often referred to as an \"ancient computer.\" \n \n The team of archaeologists, co-led by Simossi and archaeologist Brendan Foley from Lund University in Sweden, will continue studying the remains of this year's haul, before returning to the shipwreck site in May of 2018 for more excavations. \n \n While Simossi said this year's field work yielded a bigger haul than previous years, the Antikythera shipwreck has been the archaeological gift that keeps on giving. It was first discovered in 1900 by sponge divers, who spotted limbs from bronze statues. \n \n The \"orphan\" limbs, as they're called by archaeologists, suggested early on that more treasure was waiting to be found. Famous French marine explorer Jacques Cousteau excavated the ruins in 1976, finding additional statues and some smaller artifacts. (Read more about Jacques Cousteau's work and why he was so influential.) \n \n While the site has been well known for over 100 years, excavations have been intermittent since Cousteau's trip in the 1970s. Foley's focus on the region in 2014 renewed archaeological interest. Perhaps one of the most significant finds came during September of last year, when archaeologists found human remains at the site. It was the first opportunity to examine 2,000-year-old DNA from the wreck, which may provide more clues about its history. The DNA is still being analyzed but initial work suggests it was likely a young male. \n \n Discussing the find in 2016 with Nature, Foley speculated that the ship sank suddenly and from natural conditions\u2014most likely a storm.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The ship bound for Rome sunk in 1BC and was first discovered off the coast of Greece in 1900. And yet the Antikythera shipwreck is still providing new discoveries. The Guardian reports an expedition to the site last month turned up a silver tankard, a human bone, and much more. Perhaps most exciting: the arm of a bronze statue and evidence that the remains of at least seven bronze statues are still buried there. Previous bronze statues found at the Antikythera shipwreck were dated to the 4th century BC. Bronze statues from that time period are extremely rare, with only about 50 known in the world, according to Gizmodo. National Geographic reports that based on the positioning of the fingers, the newly discovered arm may belong to a statue modeled on a philosopher. Recovering the rest of the statue\u2014and the others at the site\u2014won't be easy. The Antikythera shipwreck is 180 feet underwater on a slope and has been buried by boulders from a succession of earthquakes starting in the 4th century AD. It will take a lot of time and money to move the boulders, recover the statues, and reconstruct them. Also discovered in last month's expedition was a mysterious bronze disc that the dive team originally thought could be a missing component of the famous Antikythera Mechanism. The mechanism, often called an \"ancient computer,\" could predict eclipses and the movements of various heavenly bodies and was discovered at the site. However, X-rays of the disc show it's engraved with a bull and was likely a piece of decoration for a statue or the ship itself. The next expedition to the Antikythera shipwreck is scheduled for spring 2018. (An odd item was found at the site in 2016.)",

    "document": "Well, that's one way to get into an Ivy League school. \n \n According to an email survey of more than 1,300 incoming Harvard students, the Harvard Crimson reports, 10% of the campus' new freshman class have cheated on tests and 42% have cheated on homework. \n \n That's probably going to be unwelcome news for the 377-year-old university, which is still recovering from a 2012 scandal in which more than 100 students were accused of cheating on a take-home exam for an introductory-level class on Congress. \n \n Also \n \n \n \n Then, in March, Harvard Quiz Bowl teams that won four championships between 2009 and 2011 also had wins vacated because of a cheating scandal involving one student. \n \n The Crimson's survey also reported that 8% of the incoming class expected to get jobs in the finance industry. \n \n [Updated at 10:21 p.m.: \"Even though this is a national problem, the numbers reported from the student newspaper\u2019s informal survey align with the decision Harvard College made last year to take action,\" Harvard spokesman Jeff Neal said in an email, adding that the school was addressing cheating through faculty and presentations to students, with a joint committee also addressing cheating. \"At the end of this process, we hope that Harvard will not only continue to beat national averages in reports of cheating, but also strengthen Harvard's culture of integrity, in which cheating is the rare exception.\"] \n \n In the Crimson's findings on cheating, athletes were roughly twice as likely to cheat as non-athletes, with 26% of recruited athletes responding that they had cheated on a paper or take-home assignment before arriving at Harvard. (That figure was 16% for non-recruits.) \n \n The first line of Harvard's policy on academic dishonesty states that \"All work submitted for credit is expected to be the student\u2019s own work.\" \n \n \"Plagiarism or falsification of research results will ordinarily result in a requirement to withdraw or expulsion,\" the policy states. \n \n [For the record: 11:16 p.m., Sept. 5: An earlier version of this post said the Harvard Crimson's survey found that 80% of the incoming class expected to get jobs in the finance industry. Actually, the figure is 8%.] \n \n ALSO: \n \n Whitey Bulger talks of love in letter from prison \n \n VIDEO: Kansas City police save a small deer stuck in the rain \n \n Anthony Weiner: Outburst followed man's rebuke for marrying 'an Arab' \n \n Follow L.A. Times National on Twitter ||||| Part II of a four-part series on Harvard\u2019s incoming Class of 2017, based on data collected by The Crimson in an online survey conducted in the month of August. Part I ran on Tuesday, Part II ran on Wednesday, and Part IV will run on Friday. \n \n After going public a year ago with their investigation into Harvard\u2019s largest cheating scandal in recent memory, administrators went to great lengths to promote a culture of academic integrity in the Harvard community. \n \n But the results of a Crimson survey of the Class of 2017 conducted last month suggest that some of the newest members of that community are already guilty of academic dishonesty. \n \n Ten percent of respondents admitted to having cheated on an exam, and 17 percent said they had cheated on a paper or a take-home assignment. An even greater percentage\u201442 percent\u2014admitted to cheating on a homework assignment or problem set. \n \n Recruited athletes were even more likely to admit to cheating\u201420 percent admitted to cheating on an exam, compared to 9 percent of students who were not recruited to play a varsity sport at Harvard. Twenty-six percent of recruited athletes said they had cheated on a paper or take-home assignment, compared to 16 percent of non-recruits. \n \n Across the board, the incoming freshman class reported higher rates of cheating than did Harvard\u2019s Class of 2013 in a Crimson senior survey conducted last spring. In that survey, 7 percent of graduating seniors said they had cheated on an exam, and 7 percent said they had cheated on a paper or take-home test. Thirty-two percent of graduating seniors said they cheated on a problem set or homework assignment during their undergraduate careers. \n \n The Crimson\u2019s survey of the Class of 2017 generated responses from more 1,300 incoming freshmen\u2014nearly 80 percent of the class. Part III of a four-part series on the results of the survey focuses on the academic and extracurricular lives of freshmen. \n \n ACADEMICS \n \n Recruited athletes were not the only demographic to be more likely to cheat. Men were more likely than women to report having cheated. Male freshmen were twice as likely as their female counterparts to have cheated on an exam and one-and-a-half times more likely to admit to cheating on a paper or take-home assignment. \n \n Despite the number of freshmen who admitted to academic dishonesty, their responses indicate that they overwhelmingly expect to prioritize academics at Harvard. Eighty-four percent of respondents put academics first when asked to rank their anticipated priorities among academics, extracurriculars, varsity sports, paid employment, and social life. Not a single respondent put academics at the bottom of their list. \n \n The academic interests of the new freshman class were not always consistent with concentration numbers at the College. Twenty-six percent of surveyed freshmen said they plan to concentrate in economics or government, the two most populous concentrations at Harvard that represent 21 percent of current Harvard concentrators. And not a single freshman expressed plans to study African and African American Studies, Germanic Languages and Literatures, or South Asian Studies. \n \n And just three months after a faculty committee released a set of reports advocating the revitalization of the study of the arts and humanities at Harvard, just 11 percent of surveyed freshmen said they plan to concentrate in that discipline. That figure is even lower than the current percentage of arts and humanities concentrators, who already make up just 16 percent of the student body. \n \n Surveyed freshmen were also ambitious in their undergraduate academic plans. Fifty-nine percent said they plan to pursue a secondary field, and 36 percent a language citation. Among all surveyed freshmen, 23 percent plan to pursue both. \n \n The survey results suggest that these high achievers are self-motivated. Eighty-two percent identified their greatest source of pressure as their own expectations. Just 8 percent named their parents as their greatest source of pressure. But not everyone was stressed out\u20147 percent of respondents said they are not under pressure. \n \n The majority of surveyed freshmen said they expect to spend more time studying in college than they did in high school. A plurality of respondents\u201436 percent\u2014indicated that they anticipate studying between 20 and 29 hours a week in college, and 26 percent said they anticipate spending between 30 and 39. Four percent said they anticipate studying 50 or more hours a week, and only 2 percent said they anticipate studying for 10 or fewer. \n \n In comparison, 58 percent said that they studied for 19 or fewer hours in high school. However, pre-college study habits varied widely between respondents who went to public and private secondary schools. Only 17 percent of students who attended a non-denominational private school said they studied for 10 or fewer hours a week, compared to 39 percent of public, non-charter school students. \n \n EXTRACURRICULARS \n \n Although a large majority of respondents ranked academics as their anticipated highest priority for college, a plurality\u201440 percent\u2014ranked extracurriculars second, and another 35 percent ranked it third. \n \n Surveyed freshmen were also enthusiastic about their secondary school extracurriculars. A large majority\u201484 percent\u2014were involved in community service in high school. Also popular were music clubs/bands and student government, at 39 and 37 percent, respectively. \n \n Respondents also reported being drawn to academic clubs in high school: 34 percent were involved in math clubs or competitions, 32 percent in science clubs or competitions, and 25 percent in other academic clubs. \n \n Of those who were involved in student government in high school, 79 percent said they believe that student government has the power to effect change. Respondents who did not participate in student government were a bit more skeptical, with 60 percent expressing faith in the potential of student government. \n \n Many surveyed freshmen rose to the top of their high school extracurriculars. A plurality of respondents\u201427 percent\u2014were the president or top leader of two clubs in high school, and 26 percent were in charge of one. Two percent were the leaders of six or more clubs, and 9 percent were the editors-in-chief of their high school newspapers. \n \n But not all freshmen obtained a top leadership role in their extracurriculars\u201419 percent led zero clubs. \n \n ATHLETICS \n \n One particularly popular high school extracurricular was athletics. Sixty-nine percent of surveyed freshmen reported being involved in athletics in high school, but just 12 percent of respondents were recruited to play a varsity sport at Harvard. An additional 9 percent of the class planned to walk on to a varsity team at Harvard. \n \n Three quarters of freshman athletes, including both walk-ons and recruits, said they were likely or very likely to play their sport for all four years. However, recruited athletes were more likely than intended walk-on athletes to envision themselves graduating as four-year athletes, coming in at 93 and 47 percent, respectively. \n \n Intended walk-on athletes were disproportionately drawn to certain sports. Among the intended walk-on athletes, more than 27 percent said they plan to try out for the men\u2019s or women\u2019s lightweight or heavyweight crew teams. Only three were ambitious enough to say they plan to walk on to the men\u2019s basketball team that made it to March Madness the past two seasons. \n \n Twenty-two percent of incoming recruited and walk-on athletes reported having received at least one concussion while playing a sport. Of those, two-thirds said they had been concussed once. But for most, these experiences did not dissuade them from playing their sports. Just 5 percent of all athletes and 19 percent of those who had been concussed from sports said they felt that concussions had affected their approach to their sport or desire to play that sport. \n \n Athletes and non-athletes reported differing academic backgrounds. Coming into Harvard, 33 percent of incoming recruited athletes said that BC Calculus was the highest level of math they had completed prior to college, compared to 43 percent of non-athletes. \n \n Athletes also expressed different academic plans for Harvard than their non-athlete counterparts. Although the \u201cGov Jock\u201d is a commonly referenced stereotype among Harvard students, just one incoming recruited athlete expressed plans to concentrate in government. In comparison, 11 percent of non-athlete respondents were interested in becoming government concentrators. \n \n On the other hand, economics, the most popular concentration among Harvard students, was disproportionately represented among incoming recruited athletes. Thirty-two percent said they expect to become economics concentrators, compared to 15 percent of non-athletes. \n \n \u2014Staff writer Madeline R. Conway can be reached at mconway@thecrimson.com.

The map shows the number of requests that we received between July 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009, with certain limitations. \n \n We know these numbers are imperfect and may not provide a complete picture of these government requests. For example, a single request may ask for the removal of more than one URL or for the disclosure of information for multiple users. See the FAQ for more information. \n \n (Data in JSON format.) \n \n We\u2019re new at this, and we\u2019re still learning the best way to collect and present this information. We\u2019ll continue to improve this tool and fine-tune the types of data we display. ||||| Google Inc. moved to highlight the issue of government censorship and demands for information about Web users, just as the Internet company came under fire from a group of government officials over the way it handles user privacy. \n \n The Silicon Valley giant Tuesday disclosed for the first time the number of requests it has received from government agencies for data about its users. Google also disclosed how many government requests it gets to remove content from its search engine, YouTube video site, Blogger blogging software and other services. \n \n Jessica Vascellaro and Julia Angwin talk to Simon Constable about the letter issued by 10 countries demanding that Google build more privacy protections into its services. \n \n Google is also showing how often it complies with government demands to remove Web content and said it later plans to include how often it turns over data on users. Google's disclosure tool, an online country map, excluded data for China where Google says numerating the requests would be illegal. \n \n David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, said the company decided that \"greater transparency\" about its activities could lead to less censorship. \"We hope this tool will shine some light on the scale and scope of government requests for censorship and data around the globe,\" he wrote in a blog post. \n \n Google's move comes as its critics continue to accuse the company and its peers of being reckless with user data. On Tuesday, a group of privacy commissioners from countries including Canada, France and the United Kingdom held a press conference to push Google to build better privacy protections into its services. On Monday, the group sent a letter scolding Google over privacy. \n \n A Google spokesman said the company \"released the tool now because we thought it would be useful in conversations about this trend.\" \n \n Google is pushing a broad campaign to try to curb censorship, an issue that contributed to a recent decision to shut down its censored search service in China. While Google faces heightened criticism for not doing enough to explain how it uses the information it collects, the company is trying to draw attention to other entities that seek user data. \n \n Privacy advocates\u2014who have long hounded Internet companies to be more open about how they use what they collect\u2014praised the move. \"It puts some numbers behind all the stories we have,\" said Cindy Cohn, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based digital rights non-proft organization. \n \n Others cautioned the raw numbers are hard to interpret, in part because there is little to compare them with. But they said that showing how countries stack up is a first step. \n \n Google says government requests for user data go through Google's legal team, which examines each to see if it is valid based on the law, narrows the request if possible and complies only when it must legally do so. Some requests are backed by court order; others aren't. \n \n View Full Image Associated Press A Google sign at Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. \n \n The company says it tries to notify users when information about their accounts has been requested. A Google spokesman said it is sometimes asked for account and log-in information. \n \n The company's new disclosure tool shows that Brazil made the most requests for user data during the last six months of 2009, with 3,663. The U.S. was second with 3,580. Brazil also led with 291 requests for removal of content, with Germany in second place and the U.S. fourth, behind India. \n \n Brazil's Minist\u00e9rio P\u00fablico Federal, its federal prosecution service, said in a statement late Tuesday that it \"acts based on reports of crime or complaints received directly from users\" or forwarded by a nonprofit dedicated to child safety, according to a translation of the statement. \n \n \"The information released today by Google demonstrates the care with which all levels of law enforcement agencies treat electronically protected data,\" said a spokeswoman for the Justice Department. She said the number of requests in the U.S. \"reflects a targeted approach by law enforcement agencies to effectively root out\" crimes by criminals such as identity thieves and child predators. \n \n The Mountain View, Calif., company stressed limitations to the data, which don't include countries where it receives a small amount of requests or statistics that could jeopardize important investigations. In the case of YouTube, the company said the data doesn't include requests by government agencies for removal of copyrighted content. \n \n In their Monday letter to Google, the privacy commissioners scolded the company for what they describe as a range of privacy abuses, ranging from inadequate protections in its social-networking service Buzz to its procedures for retaining images it gathers for its Street View mapping services. It calls on Google to create \"privacy-protective\" default settings and make it easy for people to delete their accounts, among other measures. \n \n \"We are increasingly concerned that, too often, the privacy rights of the world's citizens are being forgotten as Google rolls out new technological applications,\" reads the letter, which also asks for Google to issue it a response for how it plans to meet these requirements. \"Privacy cannot be sidelined in the rush to introduce new technologies to online audiences around the world,\" it states. \n \n A Google spokesman said in its response to the letter Monday that the company has \"discussed all these issues publicly many times before\" and had nothing to add. \n \n European authorities have been among the Internet giant's harshest critics when it comes to privacy issues, pressuring the company to shorten the time it retains search logs, for example. \n \n European governments blasted a settlement between Google, authors and publishers over digital books in part over concerns with what Google would do with users' reading records. \n \n Criticism is the U.S has been building too. A group of lawmakers recently asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate Google's roll-out of its Buzz service, which they contend exposed private information about Google users. Monday's letter also dwells on Buzz, claiming its launch \"betrayed a disappointing disregard for fundamental privacy norms and laws.\" Days after launching Buzz, Google acknowledged it should have made some user privacy controls more prominent and adjusted the service. \n \n Write to Jessica E.

    "document": "North Korea test-fired a ballistic missile on Sunday, the latest in a series of launches which have sparked international condemnation and threats of tougher UN sanctions. \n \n US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson described the launch, the second in a week and the 10th this year, as \"disappointing\" and \"disturbing,\" but rejected a suggestion that the US strategy to tackle North Korea was not working. \n \n The missile, described by Washington as medium-range, was fired from Pukchang in South Pyongan province and traveled about 310 miles, according to the South's armed forces. \n \n \"Our military is closely monitoring signs for additional provocation by the North Korean military and we are keeping a full military readiness,\" said a statement from Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff. \n \n The launch came just one week after the North fired a Hwasong-12 intermediate-range missile, which according to Pyongyang flew almost 500 miles and was capable of carrying a \"heavy\" nuclear warhead. \n \n Analysts said the Hwasong traveled further than any previous ballistic missile launched by the North. \n \n The May 14 launch was seen as a significant step forward as the North accelerates efforts to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the continental United States. \n \n The launches, and a threatened sixth nuclear test, have fueled tension with the administration of US President Donald Trump, who has vowed that such an ICBM launch \"won't happen.\" \n \n He warned that no option is off the table in dealing with the North's weapons program, although Washington has so far opted for sanctions and diplomatic pressure, while looking to China, the North's closest ally, to step up economic pressure on Pyongyang. \n \n Tillerson said the effects of these measures had yet to fully take effect. \n \n \"I think we are early in the game of putting pressure on them, and one could also interpret that perhaps they are just acting out now in response to some of this pressure,\" he said in an interview with Fox News Sunday. \n \n US allies South Korea and Japan issued sharp criticism of the latest missile test. \n \n Seoul's foreign ministry slammed the \"reckless and irresponsible\" firing as \"throwing cold water on the hope and longing of the new government and the international community\" for denuclearization and peace on the Korean peninsula. \n \n South Korea's incoming left-leaning government has taken a more conciliatory line with Pyongyang than its conservative predecessors, but has reacted strongly to the latest two missile tests. \n \n Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the missile launches \"trample on efforts by the international community towards a peaceful solution and are a challenge to the world,\" Kyodo News reported. \n \n The US Pacific Command said it tracked the missile until it landed in the Sea of Japan (East Sea). \n \n \"US Pacific Command stands behind our ironclad commitment to the security of our allies in the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and Japan,\" it added in a statement. \n \n Pyongyang has long had missiles that can reach targets across South Korea and Japan. \n \n With an imputed range of 2,800 miles the Hwasong-12 also puts US bases on the Pacific island of Guam within reach. \n \n 'Many more' missiles \n \n The UN Security Council met behind closed doors last Tuesday to discuss tightening sanctions on North Korea after its May 14 launch. \n \n US ambassador Nikki Haley said the United States was working with Beijing on a new sanctions resolution and warned that all countries must step up action against North Korea or face measures themselves. \n \n The North says it needs missiles and nuclear weapons to deter any attack by the United States, and state newspaper Minju Joson Sunday threatened more launches. \n \n \"If the US persists in confrontation with the DPRK (North Korea), the latter will show how the crime-woven history of the US is put to an end,\" it said. \n \n \"Many more 'Juche weapons' capable of striking the US will be launched from this land. This is the DPRK's answer to the Trump administration,\" it said, referring to the national philosophy of \"Juche\" or self-reliance. ||||| A man watches a TV news program showing image of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, published in the North Korea's Rodong Sinmun newspaper, at Seoul Railway station in Seoul, South Korea, Monday, May 22,... (Associated Press) \n \n TOKYO (AP) \u2014 North Korea says it's ready to deploy and start mass-producing a new medium-range missile capable of reaching Japan and major U.S. military bases there following a test launch it claims confirmed the missile's combat readiness and is an \"answer\" to President Donald Trump's policies. \n \n The solid-fuel Pukguksong-2 missile flew about 500 kilometers (310 miles) and reached a height of 560 kilometers (350 miles) Sunday before plunging into the Pacific Ocean. North Korea's media said more missiles will be launched in the future. \n \n Trump, traveling in Saudi Arabia, had no immediate public comment. \n \n North Korean leader Kim Jong Un ordered the launch and watched from an observation post, state media reported Monday. The Korea Central News Agency said the test verified technical aspects of the weapon system and examined its \"adaptability under various battle conditions\" before it is deployed to military units. \n \n Kim reportedly said the launch was a success, \"approved the deployment of this weapon system for action\" and said that it should \"be rapidly mass-produced.\" \n \n North Korea has significantly speeded up its missile tests over the past year or so and appears to be making tangible progress toward developing an arsenal that poses a threat not only to South Korea and Japan \u2014 which together host about 80,000 U.S. troops \u2014 but also toward an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the mainland United States. \n \n It's moving ahead with its nuclear weapons program as well. \n \n The North conducted two nuclear tests last year. It claims one was a hydrogen bomb and the other device created a more powerful explosion than any the North has previous tested. Satellite imagery suggests it could be ready to conduct its next test \u2014 which would be its sixth \u2014 at virtually any time. \n \n Pyongyang's often-stated goal is to perfect a nuclear warhead that it can put on a missile capable of hitting Washington or other U.S. cities. \n \n North Korea's media, meanwhile, have stepped up their calls for even more missile launches because of what Pyongyang claims is an increasingly hostile policy by President Donald Trump. \n \n \"The Trump administration would be well advised to lend an ear to the voices of concern that are heard from the U.S. and the international community,\" the North's Minju Joson newspaper said in a commentary Sunday. \"Many more 'Juche weapons' capable of striking the U.S. will be launched from this land.

Liquid-fuel missiles, on the other hand, are fueled at the launch site in a process that can last an hour and requires fueling and other vehicles. That makes then easier to spot and easier to destroy than the solid-fuel variety. \n \n ___ \n \n AP writers Kim Tong-hyung in Seoul and Edith M. Lederer in New York contributed to this report.

Follow him on Twitter at twitter.com/EricTalmadge and Instagram at erictalmadge. ||||| SEOUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - North Korea said on Monday it successfully tested what it called an intermediate-range ballistic missile, which met all technical requirements and could now be mass-produced, although U.S. officials and experts questioned the extent of its progress. \n \n The United States, which has condemned repeated North Korean missile launches, said Sunday\u2019s launch of what North Korea dubbed the Pukguksong-2 was of a \u201cmedium-range\u201d missile, and U.S.-based experts doubted the reliability of the relatively new solid-fuel type after so few tests. \n \n U.S. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the test did not demonstrate a new capability, or one that could threaten the United States directly. But the test was North Korea\u2019s second in a week and South Korea\u2019s new liberal government said it dashed its hopes for peace. \n \n U.S. officials have been far less sanguine about the test of a long-range KN-17, or Hwasong-12, missile just over a week ago, which U.S. officials believe survived re-entry to some degree. \n \n North Korea said that launch tested the capability to carry a \u201clarge-size heavy nuclear warhead\u201d and put the U.S. mainland within \u201csighting range.\u201d \n \n Western experts say the Hwasong-12 test did appear to have advanced North Korea\u2019s aim of developing an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland, even if it is still some way off from achieving that capability. \n \n The U.N. Security Council is due to meet on Tuesday behind closed doors to discuss Sunday\u2019s test, which defies Security Council resolutions and sanctions. The meeting was called at the request of the United States, Japan and South Korea. \n \n Washington has been trying to persuade China to agree to new sanctions on North Korea, which has conducted dozens of missile firings and tested two nuclear bombs since the start of last year. \n \n U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that a \u201cmajor, major conflict\u201d with North Korea is possible over its weapons programs, although U.S. officials say tougher sanctions, not military force, are the preferred option. \n \n North Korea\u2019s state news agency, KCNA, said the latest missile test was supervised by leader Kim Jong Un and verified the reliability of Pukguksong-2\u2019s solid-fuel engine, stage separation and late-stage guidance for a nuclear warhead. It said data was recorded by a device mounted on the warhead. \n \n \u2018PRIDE\u2019 \n \n \u201cSaying with pride that the missile\u2019s rate of hits is very accurate and Pukguksong-2 is a successful strategic weapon, he (Kim) approved the deployment of this weapon system for action,\u201d KCNA said. \n \n \u201cNow that its tactical and technical data met the requirements of the Party, this type of missile should be rapidly mass-produced in a serial way ..., he said.\u201d \n \n KCNA said Kim was able to view the Earth from a camera mounted on the missile. \u201cSupreme leader Kim Jong Un said it feels grand to look at the Earth from the rocket we launched and the entire world looks so beautiful,\u201d KCNA said. \n \n South Korea\u2019s military said the missile flew about 500 km (310 miles), reaching an altitude of 560 km (350 miles). \n \n It said the test would have provided more \u201cmeaningful data\u201d for North Korea\u2019s missile program, but further analysis was necessary to determine whether Pyongyang had mastered the technology needed to stop the warhead burning up on re-entering the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. \n \n U.S.-based experts said the Pukguksong-2 would have a maximum range of about 1,500 km (930 miles) and questioned North Korea\u2019s assertion that the reliability of the solid-fuel missile had been proven, given limited testing. \n \n \u201cEntering mass production this early in the development phase is risky, but perhaps a risk North Korea feels comfortable managing,\u201d said Michael Elleman of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \n \n Jeffrey Lewis, of the California-based Middlebury Institute of International Studies, said North Korea would probably continue to test the missile after deployment, fixing flaws as they emerged. \n \n The use of solid fuel presents advantages for weapons because it is more stable and can be transported easily allowing for a launch at very short notice from mobile launchers. \n \n Developing longer-range solid fuel missiles, however, was highly complicated and would \u201ctake time, lots of it,\u201d Elleman said. \n \n John Schilling, a missile expert contributing to Washington\u2019s 38 North think tank, estimated it would take until at least 2020 for North Korea to be able to develop an ICBM capable of reaching the U.S. mainland and until 2025 for one powered by solid fuel. \n \n North Korea\u2019s current missiles already pose a threat to South Korea and Japan and the tens of thousands of U.S. troops based in both countries. \n \n Daniel Russel, Washington\u2019s former top diplomat for Asia, said Pyongyang\u2019s aim appeared to be to convince the United States and the rest of the world of the need to accept North Korea as a nuclear-armed state. \n \n \u201cThe intended message to the United States is that your pressure campaign won\u2019t work and we\u2019ll see your sanctions and raise you yet another advance in our ballistic missile program,\u201d Russel, now diplomat in residence at the Asia Society Policy Institute, told Reuters. \n \n The scene of the intermediate-range ballistic missile Pukguksong-2's launch test. KCNA/via REUTERS \n \n On Sunday U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson termed North Korea\u2019s missile testing \u201cdisappointing, disturbing\u201d and said economic and diplomatic pressure would continue. \n \n Japan\u2019s chief Cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said on Monday it was important to cut North Korea\u2019s foreign currency earnings and to block shipments and technology transfers that aid North Korea\u2019s nuclear missile development. \n \n China repeated its call for all parties to exercise restraint and not let tension mount further.",

From the wild, windswept hills of \u201cI Am Love\u201d to the chic swimming pool of \u201cA Bigger Splash,\u201d Guadagnino vividly portrays the outside world as almost a character in itself\u2014driving the storyline, urging the other characters to be bold, inviting us to feel as if we, too, are a part of this intoxicating atmosphere. \n \n Never has this been more true than in \u201cCall Me By Your Name,\u201d a lush and vibrant masterpiece about first love set amid the warm, sunny skies, gentle breezes and charming, tree-lined roads of northern Italy. Guadagnino takes his time establishing this place and the players within it. He\u2019s patient in his pacing, and you must be, as well. But really, what\u2019s the rush? It\u2019s the summer of 1983, and there\u2019s nothing to do but read, play piano, ponder classic art and pluck peaches and apricots from the abundant fruit trees. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Within this garden of sensual delights, an unexpected yet life-changing romance blossoms between two young men who initially seem completely different on the surface. \n \n 17-year-old Elio (Timothee Chalamet) is once again visiting his family\u2019s summer home with his parents: his father (Michael Stuhlbarg), an esteemed professor of Greco-Roman culture, and his mother (Amira Casar), a translator and gracious hostess. Elio has the gangly body of a boy but with an intellect and a quick wit beyond his years, and the worldliness his parents have fostered within him at least allows him to affect the fa\u00e7ade of sophistication. But beneath the bravado, a gawky and self-conscious kid sometimes still emerges. By the end of the summer, that kid will be vanquished forever. \n \n An American doctoral student named Oliver (Armie Hammer) arrives for the annual internship Elio\u2019s father offers. Oliver is everything Elio isn\u2019t\u2014or at least, that\u2019s our primary perception of him. Tall, gorgeous and supremely confident, he is the archetypal all-American hunk. But as polite as he often can be, Oliver can also breeze out of a room with a glib, \u201cLater,\u201d making him even more of a tantalizing mystery. \n \n Chalamet and Hammer have just ridiculous chemistry from the get-go, even though (or perhaps because) their characters are initially prickly toward each other: testing, pushing, feeling each other out, yet constantly worrying about what the other person thinks. They flirt by trying to one-up each other with knowledge of literature or classical music, but long before they ever have any physical contact, their electric connection is unmistakable. Lazy poolside chats are fraught with tension; spontaneous bike rides into town to run errands feel like nervous first dates. \n \n Writer James Ivory\u2019s generous, sensitive adaptation of Andre Aciman\u2019s novel reveals these characters and their ever-evolving dynamic in beautifully steady yet detailed fashion. And so when Elio and Oliver finally dare to reveal their true feelings for each other\u2014a full hour into the film\u2014the moment makes you hold your breath with its intimate power, and the emotions feel completely authentic and earned. \n \n The way Elio and Oliver peel away each other\u2019s layers has both a sweetness and a giddy thrill to it, even though they feel they must keep their romance a secret from Elio\u2019s parents. (Elio also has a kinda-sorta girlfriend in Marzia [Esther Garrel], a thoughtful, playful French teen who\u2019s also in town for the summer.) One of the many impressive elements of Chalamet\u2019s beautiful, complex performance is the effortless way he transitions between speaking in English, Italian and French, depending on whom Elio is with at the time. It gives him an air of maturity that\u2019s otherwise still in development; eventually his massive character arc feels satisfying and true. \n \n Advertisement \n \n But Oliver\u2019s evolution is just as crucial, and Hammer finds the tricky balance between the character\u2019s swagger and his vulnerability as he gives himself over to this exciting affair. He\u2019s flirty but tender\u2014the couple\u2019s love scenes are heartbreaking and intensely erotic all at once\u2014and even though he\u2019s the more experienced of the two, he can\u2019t help but diving in headlong. \n \n And yet, the most resonant part of \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d may not even be the romance itself, but rather the lingering sensation that it can\u2019t last, which Guadagnino evokes through long takes and expert use of silence. A feeling of melancholy tinges everything, from the choice of a particular shirt to the taste of a perfectly ripe peach. And oh my, that peach scene\u2014Guadagnino was wise when he took a chance and left it in from the novel. It really works, and it\u2019s perhaps the ultimate example of how masterfully the director manipulates and enlivens all of our senses. \n \n There\u2019s a lushness to the visual beauty of this place, but it\u2019s not so perfect as to be off-putting. Quite the opposite. Despite the director\u2019s infamous eye for meticulous detail, cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom\u2019s 35mm images provide a tactile quality that heightens the sensations, makes them feel almost primal. We see the wind gently rustling through the trees, or streaks of sunlight hitting Elio\u2019s dark curls through an open bedroom window, and while it\u2019s all subtly sensual, an inescapable tension is building underneath. \n \n Guadagnino establishes that raw, immediate energy from the very beginning through his use of music. The piano of contemporary classical composer John Adams\u2019 intricate, insistent \u201cHallelujah Junction \u2013 1st Movement\u201d engages us during the elegant title sequence, while Sufjan Stevens\u2019 plaintive, synthy \u201cVisions of Gideon\u201d during the film\u2019s devastating final shot ends the film on an agonizingly sad note. (You\u2019ll want to stay all the way through the closing credits\u2014that long, last image is so transfixing. I seriously don\u2019t know how Chalamet pulled it off, but there is serious craft on display here.) \n \n Advertisement \n \n In between is Guadagnino\u2019s inspired use of the Psychedelic Furs\u2019 \u201cLove My Way,\u201d an iconic \u201980s New Wave tune you\u2019ve probably heard a million times before but will never hear the same way again. The first time he plays it, it\u2019s at an outdoor disco where Oliver feels so moved by the bouncy, percussive beat that he can\u2019t help but jump around to it and get lost in the music, lacking all sense of self-consciousness. Watching this towering figure just go for it on the dance floor in his Converse high-tops is a moment of pure joy, but it\u2019s also as if a dam has broken within Elio, being so close to someone who\u2019s feeling so free. The second time he plays it, toward the end of Oliver and Elio\u2019s journey, it feels like the soundtrack to a time capsule as it recaptures a moment of seemingly endless emotional possibility. \n \n They know what they\u2019ve found has to end\u2014we know it has to end. But a beautiful monologue from the always excellent Stuhlbarg as Elio\u2019s warmhearted and open-minded father softens the blow somewhat. It\u2019s a perfectly calibrated scene in a film full of them, and it\u2019s one of a million reasons why \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d is far and away the best movie of the year.",

The film by Luca Guadagnino, adapted from the novel by Andre Aciman, has a 96% rating from critics on Rotten Tomatoes. Their thoughts: The film is a \"generous, sensitive adaptation\" of Aciman's novel, benefited by the \"ridiculous chemistry\" of Hammer and 22-year-old Chalamet, who gives a \"beautiful, complex performance.\" These are just a few of the \u201cmillion reasons why Call Me By Your Name is far and away the best movie of the year,\" writes Christy Lemire at RogerEbert.com, who also calls the film \"a lush and vibrant masterpiece.\" It's \"a powerfully erotic and affecting love story, albeit one so closely and intimately observed that the term 'slow burn' seems almost inadequate,\" writes Justin Chang at the Los Angeles Times. \"The undercurrents of lust, intrigue, jealousy and sexual anxiety flickering between Elio and Oliver are observed with a precision and playfulness that verge on the Hitchcockian,\" he adds, but it's the film's \"compassion and wry wisdom \u2026 that catch you off-guard.\" It's \"a spellbinding, almost ecstatically beautiful movie\" that's \"almost sinfully enjoyable,\" to boot, writes Ann Hornaday at the Washington Post. The \"timeless\" coming-of-age tale \"acknowledges the purity and sculptural beauty of youth\" but adds plenty of erotic tension. Chalamet brings it all together with \"a note-perfect combination of cocky self-assurance and wary naivet\u00e9,\" Hornaday writes. \"Chalamet delivers one of the year's best performances\" in a film simple in its subject matter, writes Rafer Guzman at Newsday. \"It's about two people and their feelings\"\u2014\"erotic yet never graphic, heartfelt yet highly stylized.\" Two scenes to watch out for: one featuring \"an eyebrow-raising use of a peach,\" and another in which Elio's father (Michael Stuhlbarg) \"gives a lovely monologue with such purity of emotion that it's almost breathtaking.\"",

He was one of many frogs scientists raced to collect as the deadly chytrid fungus closed in on central Panama. \n \n \u201cIt was likened to just rescuing things from a burning house,\u201d Mandica says. \n \n The species occurred in a very small range, at an elevation where the fungus proved especially deadly. Field studies suggest up to 85 percent of all the amphibians on Toughie's home turf were wiped out.

Lines remain down from Houston - one of the areas hardest hit by the storm to Herbert, Texas. \n \n \"We currently estimate that we will be able to return to service from Houston Sunday, following an evaluation of our infrastructure and successful execution of our start up plan,\" Colonial said. \n \n Colonial Pipeline 1 carries as much as 40 percent of the South's gasoline. Line 2 primarily transports diesel and aviation fuels. \n \n Earlier: \n \n Colonial Pipeline has shut down key fuel lines running from Houston through Mississippi, Georgia Alabama and up the East Coast after Hurricane Harvey forced the closure of refineries and other facilities. \n \n Colonial said its facilities west of Lake Charles, Louisiana are out of service due to the storms. That closure, along with hurricane-related shutdowns of refineries in the Gulf Coast, led to the decision to cease operations on Colonial's Line 2, which transports primarily diesel and aviation fuels. Line 1, which carries gasoline, will suspend service today. Line 1 had been operating at a reduced capacity since Harvey hit. \n \n Line 1 provides nearly 40 percent of the South's gasoline. \n \n \"Once Colonial is able to ensure that its facilities are safe to operate and refiners in Lake Charles and points east have the ability to move product to Colonial, our system will resume operations,\" the company said in a statement. \n \n By volume, Colonial is the largest pipeline operator in the country, delivering more than 100 million gallons of refined products each day to markets between Houston and New York City, serving more than 50 million people. Of the 26 refineries connected to the Colonial system, 13 are located between Houston and Lake Charles, the company said. \n \n The shutdowns are adding to growing concerns about fuel availability as drivers around the Southeast find themselves paying more at the pump. On Thursday morning, the average price of a gallon of gasoline in the U.S. was $2.462, up almost 2 cents from yesterday and 11 cents from last week, according to fuel tracking site GasBuddy. \n \n Experts said prices could increase as much as 35 cents a gallon as refineries remain offline during storm cleanup. \n \n In its statement, Colonial addressed those concerns. \n \n \"Colonial is one part of the fuel delivery system, and there are multiple means of supplying the market to mitigate concerns with supply, including other pipelines, trucks, and barges,\" it said. \n \n Georgia-based Colonial was twice forced to shut down parts of its pipeline last year due to a leak and a fire in Alabama. The shutdowns led to higher gas prices and isolated shortages across the Southeast. \n \n Hurricane Harvey made its first landfall in Texas last Friday, dumping more than 50 inches of rain on Houston and surrounding counties. The storm made a second landfall Wednesday in Louisiana and is now tracking to the northeast through Mississippi and northern Alabama. ||||| The Trump administration has tapped an emergency stockpile of crude oil in response to the major refinery outages in the U.S. Gulf Coast caused by Hurricane Harvey. \n \n The Energy Department said it will send 500,000 barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the Phillips 66 (PSX) refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana. \n \n The oil reserve is made up of a complex of tanks and deeper underground storage caverns. It can hold more than 700 million barrels of oil, making it the largest emergency oil reserve in the world. \n \n The move is aimed at shielding Americans from higher gasoline prices, which have begun to rise sharply due to a shortage of gasoline caused by refinery shutdowns, port closures and oil production outages. \n \n Officials said the refinery, which hasn't been shutdown by the historic flooding, requested the release of emergency oil. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) is the largest shareholder in Phillips 66 \n \n The Energy Department said it will \"continue to provide assistance as deemed necessary,\" including more potential drawdowns from the emergency reserve. \n \n The decision to tap the oil reserve follows the shutdown of the Colonial Pipeline, which normally carries a huge amount of gasoline between Houston and the East Coast. The key pipeline was knocked offline because there isn't enough gasoline flowing for it to operate. \n \n Related: Harvey shuts down major fuel pipeline \n \n Energy Secretary Rick Perry noted the Colonial Pipeline outage is driven by limited gasoline supplies, not damage to the pipeline itself. \n \n \"I don't know how long it's going to take to get those (refineries) back on,\" Perry told reporters on Thursday aboard Air Force Two with Vice President Mike Pence. \n \n Matt Smith, director of commodities research at ClipperData, said the emergency stockpile release is likely aimed at helping to fill up the Colonial Pipeline. \n \n \"There's a huge logistical challenge going on at the moment because those refineries up and running don't have access to the oil they need,\" said Smith. \n \n The Energy Department is also trying to ease fears about a severe gasoline shortage. \n \n \"This release sends a message to the market that the U.S. government is willing to address any kind of supply shortages. There's definitely a psychological impact,\" said Joe McMonigle, a former Energy Department official who now serves as senior energy analyst at the Hedgeye Potomac Research Group. \n \n The widespread disruption in the U.S. Gulf Coast has lifted the average price of a gallon of gasoline by 10 cents to $2.449 on Thursday, according to AAA. \n \n Related: Harvey to be one of the most expensive natural disasters ever \n \n McMonigle predicted the Energy Department will take more steps because refinery recoveries are likely to be slow. \n \n Historic flooding caused by Harvey knocked one-fifth of the nation's refining capacity offline, according to S&P Global Platts. Thirteen oil refineries in Texas have shut down or are in the process of closing, while others are operating at reduced rates. \n \n \"The situation on the ground is even worse than what is being reported. This may not be a quick turnaround. it could take some time for the industry to get back on its feet,\" McMonigle said. \n \n The U.S. dipped into the strategic oil reserve during other disruptions, such as the 2011 turmoil in Libya and during Hurricane Katrina in 2005. \n \n Earlier this year, President Trump proposed selling off half of the oil sitting in the reserve to raise revenue. Some analysts at the time criticized the proposal as risky. ||||| FILE PHOTO: Clouds from Hurricane Harvey are seen in the background as smoke rises from a burn off at an oil refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas, U.S. August 26, 2017. REUTERS/Adrees Latif/File Photo \n \n HOUSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Harvey\u2019s impact on the energy industry spread worldwide as flooded U.S. refiners and closed fuel pipelines threatened to squeeze national supply, roiling global fuel markets and rerouting millions of barrels of fuel to the Americas to avert shortages. \n \n The storm, which lashed Louisiana with rain on Thursday, has pummeled the U.S. Gulf Coast, immersing Houston, Texas, and the surrounding area in several feet of water and forcing the closure of about a quarter of U.S. refining capacity. \n \n Benchmark U.S. gasoline prices RBc1 and margins RBc1-Clc1 surged anew on Thursday. The jump came after the Colonial Pipeline, the biggest U.S. fuel system, said it would shut its main lines to the Northeast by Thursday amid outages at pumping points and lack of supply from refiners. \n \n That artery can carry 3 million barrels of gasoline and other products daily. \n \n At least two East Coast refineries have run out of gasoline for immediate delivery as they scrambled to fill barges for markets normally supplied by the Gulf Coast, two refinery sources said. \n \n Others were seen running at higher rates to boost profitability by filling shortages. \n \n \u201cThis is going to be the worst thing the U.S. has seen in decades from an energy standpoint,\u201d said an East Coast market source, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the press. \n \n On Thursday, the U.S. Energy Department said it would release 500,000 barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to supply the refineries that are still running in an effort to stem fuel shortages. \n \n The first emergency release from the reserve since 2012 will be delivered to the Phillips 66 (PSX.N) refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana, according to a department statement. \n \n Concerns over fuel shortages ahead of the U.S. Labor Day extended weekend were mounting, said analysts at JBC Energy. \n \n U.S. gasoline futures RBc1 topped $2 per gallon for the first time since 2015, up more than 20 percent since just before the storm began, while U.S. crude oil prices were on track for their steepest monthly losses in more than a year. [O/R] \n \n Average U.S. retail fuel prices have surged by more than a dime per gallon from a week ago, the AAA said early on Thursday. \n \n The Gulf makes up nearly half of total refining capacity in the United States, the world's largest net exporter of refined petroleum products, and the storm is set to impact global flows. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2xzsKWz) \n \n About 4.4 million barrels of U.S. refining capacity have been shut by Harvey, including the nation\u2019s largest refiner, Motiva Port Arthur, which can process more than 600,000 barrels a day. The total shut-in is about 24 percent of U.S. refining capacity, almost equal to Japan\u2019s daily consumption. \n \n The closures rattled global fuel markets, and European and Asian traders diverted millions of barrels of gasoline and diesel to the Americas to help fill that gap. But the supplies from those distant markets may not arrive fast enough to avert a crunch. \n \n \u201cSourcing additional barrels from Europe is a potential solution, but an increased level of uncertainty is introduced surrounding the timeliness of delivery, given the logistics of travel time and securing tankers,\u201d said Michael Tran, director of global energy strategy at RBC Capital Markets. \n \n The Asian refining margin on Thursday hit $10.41 a barrel, the highest since January 2016 DUB-SIN-REF. Gasoline prices in the region GL92-SIN-CRK were $16.34 a barrel, also the highest since January 2016. In Europe, benchmark gasoline margins jumped to a two-year high of nearly $21 per barrel. \n \n The U.S. disruptions have hit wholesalers. The premium for Chicago-area gasoline above benchmark futures is at its highest since June 2016, while the Gulf Coast price is at its widest above futures since August 2012. [PRO/U] \n \n Suppliers in Chicago were trying to secure supplies after the Explorer Pipeline, which typically carries about 350,000 barrels a day (bpd) to the region, shut down. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not a significant problem at the present time, but it could turn into one,\u201d said William Fleischli, executive vice president of the Illinois Petroleum Marketers Association, which represents 400 fuel distributors. Fleischli said much depended on how long the shutdowns last. \n \n Average retail gasoline prices have risen to $2.449 per gallon nationwide, up 4.5 cents a gallon from a day earlier and 10.1 cents from a week ago, AAA data showed. \n \n In Georgia and North Carolina, fuel prices are up about 17 cents and average prices in South Carolina have risen nearly 20 cents per gallon from a week ago. \n \n Though flood waters have yet to recede, energy analysts said they anticipated potential long-term effects from the historic storm. Goldman Sachs analysts wrote Wednesday they expected about a tenth of what is now offline to stay shut for several months. ||||| Gasoline prices were surging again Thursday amid refinery closings in Texas caused by Hurricane Harvey. \n \n Gas futures for September delivery were up 12% to $2.11 a gallon at 10:40 a.m. ET. In their eighth straight day of gains, futures are on their longest rising streak in four years, according to Bloomberg. Futures for October delivery also rallied. \n \n Prices at the pump are also higher. The AAA average national gas price at 3:43 a.m. ET on Thursday was $2.449 a gallon, up from an average price of $2.348 a gallon last week. \n \n Motiva's refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, which is the largest refinery in the US, shut down Wednesday as floodwater rose. And on Thursday, Colonial Pipeline, which owns the largest pipeline for gas distribution in the US, had planned to shut down its gasoline line because Gulf Coast refiners were unable to process crude oil, Bloomberg reported. \"Deliveries will be intermittent and dependent on terminal and refinery supply,\" the company said in an update. \n \n To help with the gasoline shortage, the Energy Department on Thursday said it was releasing 500,000 barrels of oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve that holds supplies for emergencies. The agency said it loaned the barrels of both sweet and sour crude to a Phillips 66 refinery in Lake Charles, Louisiana, which has not been affected by Hurricane Harvey. \n \n The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported that some gas stations in the area may run out of supplies during the Labor Day weekend. Gas stations on the East Coast could also experience shortages, Bloomberg reported, and this could send gas prices even higher. \n \n Crude-oil prices rose in a \"knee jerk reaction\" tracking gasoline following news that Exxon Mobil was shutting down its Beaumont, Texas, refinery for up to two weeks, according to Jesse Cohen of Investing.com. The closing of the Motiva refinery and news that the storm Irma had strengthened to a hurricane and could hit Gulf production provided another boost, Cohen said. \n \n The front-month West Texas Intermediate crude-oil contract gained 2.5% to $47.09 a barrel but remained on track for its fifth straight weekly decline.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Hurricane Harvey has devastated Texas, and it's also bringing bad news for drivers across the nation. Harvey's impact on the Gulf Coast caused several major refineries and a key gasoline pipeline to shut down, the AP reports. What that means: Prices are on the rise: Per GasBuddy, the average price of a gallon of gas in the US was $2.469 Thursday afternoon. That's up 2.3 cents from Wednesday, 11.7 cents from last week, 15.1 cents from last month, and 24.3 cents from last year. They're even higher in some areas: Reuters, citing AAA data, says fuel prices in Georgia and North Carolina are up 17 cents a gallon from a week ago; in South Carolina, almost 20 cents. And they're likely to go higher: Per Business Insider, gas futures for both September and October are up. In fact, Thursday was their eighth straight day of gains, their longest rising streak in four years. There's also the problem of gas availability: The AP reports that QuikTrip, one of the biggest convenience store chains in the country, is going to stop selling gas entirely at about half of its stores in the Dallas-Fort Worth metro area in anticipation of shortages. Even locations that have gas may run out: The Star-Telegram reports that convenience store operators and gasoline retailers are warning there's a major chance some Texas locations will run out of gas this weekend due to supply chain disruptions. Specifics on those disruptions: Colonial, the largest pipeline operator in the country, has shut down key fuel lines (AL.com) and Motiva Enterprises' Port Arthur, Texas refinery, the biggest in the country, may be closed for as long as two weeks (CNBC). Some of the other refineries and pipelines affected are starting back up, CNBC reports. A dire quote: \"Hurricane Harvey has potentially cut US fuel-making capacity to the lowest level since 2008,\" per Bloomberg. And another: \"This is going to be the worst thing the US has seen in decades from an energy standpoint,\" a market analyst tells Reuters. What's being done to help: Per Bloomberg, the EPA is exempting many southeastern states from requirements that they use fuel meeting clean-air standards. And CNNMoney reports the Trump administration is tapping the emergency US oil reserve; the Energy Department will send 500,000 barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the Phillips 66 refinery in Louisiana.

    "document": "Hello. My name is Chris Kluwe, and for eight years I was the punter for the Minnesota Vikings. In May 2013, the Vikings released me from the team. At the time, quite a few people asked me if I thought it was because of my recent activism for same-sex marriage rights, and I was very careful in how I answered the question. My answer, verbatim, was always, \"I honestly don't know, because I'm not in those meetings with the coaches and administrative people.\" \n \n This is a true answer. I honestly don't know if my activism was the reason I got fired. \n \n However, I'm pretty confident it was. \n \n Allow myself to tell you a story about ... myself. The following is a record of what happened to me during my 2012 season with the Minnesota Vikings, written down immediately after the 2013 draft in April, when I realized what was happening, and revised recently only for clarity. I tried to keep things as objective as possible, and anything you see in quotes are words that I directly recall being said to me. \n \n This is a story about how actions have consequences, no matter how just or moral you think your cause happens to be, and it's a story about the price people all too often pay for speaking out. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Today, April 30, 2013, I am writing an account of events that transpired during my time with the Minnesota Vikings during the 2012 NFL season and leading into the 2013 season (so I don't forget them in case it is necessary to recall what happened). \n \n During the summer of 2012, I was approached by a group called Minnesotans for Marriage Equality, which asked if I would be interested in helping defeat what was known as the Minnesota Gay Marriage Amendment. The proposed amendment would have defined marriage as \"only a union of one man and one woman.\" (It was voted down, and same-sex marriage is now legal in Minnesota.) I said yes, but that I would have to clear it with the team first. After talking to the Vikings legal department, I was given the go-ahead to speak on the issue as long as I made it clear I was acting as a private citizen, not as a spokesman for the Vikings, which I felt was fair and complied with. I did several radio advertisements and a dinner appearance for Minnesotans for Marriage Equality. No one from the Vikings' legal department told me I was doing anything wrong or that I had to stop. \n \n Advertisement \n \n On Sept. 7, 2012, this website published a letter I had written to Maryland delegate Emmett C. Burns Jr. chastising him for trampling the free-speech rights of Baltimore Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo. The letter also detailed why I supported the rights of same-sex couples to get married. It quickly went viral. \n \n On Sept. 8, the head coach of the Vikings, Leslie Frazier, called me into his office after our morning special-teams meeting. I anticipated it would be about the letter (punters aren't generally called into the principal's office). Once inside, Coach Frazier immediately told me that I \"needed to be quiet, and stop speaking out on this stuff\" (referring to my support for same-sex marriage rights). I told Coach Frazier that I felt it was the right thing to do (what with supporting equality and all), and I also told him that one of his main coaching points to us was to be \"good men\" and to \"do the right thing.\" He reiterated his fervent desire for me to cease speaking on the subject, stating that \"a wise coach once told me there are two things you don't talk about in the NFL, politics and religion.\" I repeated my stance that this was the right thing to do, that equality is not something to be denied anyone, and that I would not promise to cease speaking out. At that point, Coach Frazier told me in a flat voice, \"If that's what you feel you have to do,\" and the meeting ended. The atmosphere was tense as I left the room. \n \n Advertisement \n \n On Sept. 9, before our game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, the owner of the team, Zygi Wilf, came up to me, shook my hand, and told me: \"Chris, I'm proud of what you've done. Please feel free to keep speaking out. I just came from my son's best friend's wedding to his partner in New York, and it was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.\" \n \n On Sept. 10, I was once again called into Leslie Frazier's office. Coach Frazier asked me if I was going to keep speaking out on the matter of same-sex marriage and equality. I responded that I was, and I related what Zygi Wilf had said to me at the game the day before. Coach Frazier looked stunned and put his hand across his face. He then told me: \"Well, he writes the checks. It looks like I've been overruled.\" At that point, he got his personal public relations assistant on a conference call to ask her what to do. She outlined some strategies, mainly centered around talking only with large national media groups and ignoring the smaller market stations (radio, television, print). I said that I would be sure not to say anything to denigrate the team, but that I would like to talk with anyone who was interested. Both Coach Frazier and his PR person attempted to dissuade me from this course of action, saying that the message would be more effective if presented properly. I suspected this was another attempt to keep me from speaking out. I did not agree to any course of action they suggested, and I left the meeting once it concluded. \n \n On or around Sept. 17 (could have possibly been Sept. 19), I approached our head of public relations, Bob Hagan. It had come to my attention via Twitter that multiple news sources were attempting to contact me through the Vikings and had been unable to reach me (I learned this via those same agencies asking me on Twitter if I was available for interviews, to which I responded affirmatively). I told Bob Hagan that from this point on, any media requests he received were to be forwarded immediately to me. I would take care of them. He told me that he was trying to protect me from being overwhelmed. I repeated my request that he forward all media requests to me, as I could handle them. He assented, and later that day I found three media requests in my locker (to which I had already responded via Twitter), two of which were dated from four to six days earlier. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Throughout the months of September, October, and November, Minnesota Vikings special-teams coordinator Mike Priefer would use homophobic language in my presence. He had not done so during minicamps or fall camp that year, nor had he done so during the 2011 season. He would ask me if I had written any letters defending \"the gays\" recently and denounce as disgusting the idea that two men would kiss, and he would constantly belittle or demean any idea of acceptance or tolerance. I tried to laugh these off while also responding with the notion that perhaps they were human beings who deserved to be treated as human beings. Mike Priefer also said on multiple occasions that I would wind up burning in hell with the gays, and that the only truth was Jesus Christ and the Bible. He said all this in a semi-joking tone, and I responded in kind, as I felt a yelling match with my coach over human rights would greatly diminish my chances of remaining employed. I felt uncomfortable each time Mike Priefer said these things. After all, he was directly responsible for reviewing my job performance, but I hoped that after the vote concluded in Minnesota his behavior would taper off and eventually stop. \n \n On Oct. 25, I had a poor game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the Vikings brought in several punters for a workout to potentially replace me. I do not believe this was motivated by my speaking out on same-sex equality, though I do not know for sure. During the special-teams meeting the following day, Mike Priefer berated me in an incredibly harsh tone the likes of which I've never heard a coach use about my abilities as a punter (and I have been berated before). The room went silent after he finished speaking, in a way that normally does not happen during meetings when someone is being called out. The Vikings kept me on as their punter. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Near the end of November, several teammates and I were walking into a specialist meeting with Coach Priefer. We were laughing over one of the recent articles I had written supporting same-sex marriage rights, and one of my teammates made a joking remark about me leading the Pride parade. As we sat down in our chairs, Mike Priefer, in one of the meanest voices I can ever recall hearing, said: \"We should round up all the gays, send them to an island, and then nuke it until it glows.\" The room grew intensely quiet, and none of the players said a word for the rest of the meeting. The atmosphere was decidedly tense. I had never had an interaction that hostile with any of my teammates on this issue\u2014some didn't agree with me, but our conversations were always civil and respectful. Afterward, several told me that what Mike Priefer had said was \"messed up.\" \n \n After this point, Mike Priefer began saying less and less to me, and our interactions were stilted. I grew increasingly concerned that my job would be in jeopardy. I had seen the same pattern of behavior directed at our former placekicker, Ryan Longwell, whom Mike Priefer began to ignore during the 2011 season and who was cut after rookie minicamps in early May 2012. \n \n On Dec. 9, I wore on my jersey a small patch made out of athletic tape on which I'd written, \"Vote Ray Guy\"\u2014a small protest against punter Ray Guy's exclusion from the Pro Football Hall of Fame. At no point in the game did Coach Priefer instruct me to take off the patch, nor did he appear even to notice it. The only person who talked to me about it was Les Pico, our executive director of player development, who told me that the league office would fine me if I didn't take it off. I told him it was worth it, and we both laughed. \n \n Advertisement \n \n On Dec. 13, during his weekly media session, Mike Priefer was asked about the patch in a joking manner. He responded tersely: \"I don't even want to talk about it. Those distractions are getting old for me, to be honest with you.\" When asked if he had talked to me about the distractions, he said: \"No. He won't listen.\" At no time during the season had Coach Priefer ever approached me about my actions, nor had he ever made any intimation that I was a distraction to the team. He also said: \"To me, it's getting old. He's got to focus on punting and holding.\" Up to that point I had not dropped a single hold on field goals, and despite a shaky game against Tampa Bay and several substandard punts against other teams, both my net- and gross-punting marks were nearly in line with my career averages, which remain the best in Vikings history. I had also been repeatedly instructed by Mike Priefer to dial back the distance of my kicks to give our coverage team a better chance at getting down the field, a request I did my best to follow despite knowing it would mean sacrificing my own averages and allowing people to fashion an argument against me based on those numbers. His exact words were: \"Chris, we need you to kick it higher and shorter, because our coverage team sucks. We need to force fair catches as much as possible.\" I complied, as I had always been taught to put the team before myself. \n \n In November and December, I was frequently marked for negative scores by Mike Priefer on our \"Production Point\" sheet for punts that earlier had been marked positive, despite the numbers being almost exactly the same in terms of hangtime and distance. I do not know if these \"Production Point\" sheets were ever shown to our general manager or head coach, nor do I know if they were used to evaluate my job performance, though I suspect they were. I often laughed with other players about how the points seemed to be arbitrarily assigned, and we all agreed that there was no way to succeed as far as the \"Production Point\" charts were concerned. The vast majority of special-teams players already had negative point totals for the year. \n \n Advertisement \n \n After the season concluded in early January 2013, I had my end-of-year meeting with Coach Priefer. It was brief, and he told me that the team would probably be exploring options for competition. Several days later, the team signed T.J. Conley to a futures contract, which I saw as legitimate competition or a backup plan in case my knee surgery did not go well. I had been playing the past five years on a torn meniscus in my left knee, and the discomfort had gotten to the point where surgery was a necessity. Recovery time was anticipated to be two to four weeks, and my surgery was scheduled for Jan. 31. The surgery went smoothly, as did rehab, and I began kicking again in late February. At no point did Mike Priefer, Leslie Frazier, or Vikings general manager Rick Spielman contact me, nor did they ever ask how the surgery had gone, nor did they ever ask how my return to kicking was progressing. \n \n On Feb. 11, I received a message saying, \"Please fly under radar please,\" from a phone number I would later learn belonged to Rick Spielman. The text message presumably concerned several things I had tweeted that day regarding Pope Benedict XVI's decision to step down. Spielman later called me and asked me to stop tweeting about the pope because angry people were ringing up team headquarters in Winter Park, Minn. It should be noted that my tweets concerned the lack of transparency and endemic institutional corruption of the Catholic Church, which among other things allowed child abuse to flourish. I also pointed out how that applied equally to financial and government institutions, and reiterated that I had nothing against anyone's religion, only against the abuses of power that institutions allow. Nonetheless, I complied with Spielman's request and did not tweet anything else about the pope that day, or in the future. \n \n In March and early April, I spent three to four days a week kicking at the local sports complex near my house in Huntington Beach, Calif., where I lived with my family during the offseason. I felt that I had returned to my in-season form and was quite pleased with my progress. I was confident that in a fair competition with T.J. Conley I would prevail. \n \n Advertisement \n \n On April 21, I arrived back in Minnesota for the start of Organized Team Activities (OTAs), which commenced the following day. When I arrived at the facility, I went through my normal workouts and then went upstairs to talk to Mike Priefer. He hadn't contacted me since our year-end meeting in early January. We had a brief talk, and he mentioned that I would only have to attend the punt-special-team meetings. In previous years, I had attended all the special-teams meetings, as was expected of me. At no point was the draft mentioned. \n \n On April 27, I spent an hour at the Metrodome signing autographs for the Vikings draft party, an event for which the team requested my attendance, and then left to record some music with my band. My phone rang, and a local reporter from the Star Tribune asked me, \"Chris, what are your thoughts on the Vikings taking a punter in the fifth round of the draft?\" At this point I knew for certain the Vikings were replacing me. I hadn't been informed that drafting a punter was a possibility, and historically punters do not get drafted unless the team figures he'll be a starter. Multiple pundits questioned the Vikings' decision to draft a punter in the fifth round, as there were still several positions of need, and several players at those positions still available to be drafted. No one from the team called me on April 27 or 28. \n \n On April 29, my first day back in the facility after the draft, I met with Rick Spielman after Mike Priefer had told me Rick wanted to see me. Rick told me that this was solely about competition and had nothing to do with my views. I do not believe he was telling the truth. I had not been approached about reducing my contract for cap-space purposes, nor was my punting average poor enough to justify spending a fifth-round pick on a punter for competition. (My gross average in 2012 was almost exactly my career average, and I had a career-best net average. Statistically speaking, I am also the best punter in Vikings history, despite seven years of coaches asking me to deliberately sacrifice my own numbers to help the team, a request with which I always complied.) Rick said he would speak with me again after the rookie minicamp from May 3-5. I then spoke with Coach Priefer. He reiterated that this was about competition, which I suspect was also a lie, and then he started talking about me in the past tense, about how professional I had been, and how it had been a pleasure working with me. The meeting concluded several minutes later. I also learned that T.J. Conley had been cut that day. \n \n Advertisement \n \n At no point from the end of the season, on Jan. 9, 2013, to my arrival at OTAs, on April 21, was I contacted by Leslie Frazier or by any of the other coaches. Rick Spielman called me once, as stated earlier, to insist I stop tweeting about the pope. \n \n On May 6, I had a meeting with Rick Spielman. He told me that the team was releasing me, and he thanked me for the great work I had done for the Vikings, and also said he would tell other teams how professionally and competently I had executed my duties over the years. I then had a meeting with Leslie Frazier, who repeated that I had been \"a fantastic player for this organization\" and who also told me, \"Don't close any doors behind you\u2014you never know when things will come full circle.\" He thanked me for my services as well, and said I was a great football player. Then I was escorted from the premises and was no longer a Viking. \n \n So there you have it. It's my belief, based on everything that happened over the course of 2012, that I was fired by Mike Priefer, a bigot who didn't agree with the cause I was working for, and two cowards, Leslie Frazier and Rick Spielman, both of whom knew I was a good punter and would remain a good punter for the foreseeable future, as my numbers over my eight-year career had shown, but who lacked the fortitude to disagree with Mike Priefer on a touchy subject matter. (Frazier was fired on Monday, at the conclusion of a 5-10-1 season.) One of the main coaching points I've heard throughout my entire life is, \"How you respond to difficult situations defines your character,\" and I think it's a good saying. I also think it applies to more than just the players. \n \n Advertisement \n \n If there's one thing I hope to achieve from sharing this story, it's to make sure that Mike Priefer never holds a coaching position again in the NFL, and ideally never coaches at any level. (According to the Pioneer Press, he is \"the only in-house candidate with a chance\" at the head-coaching job.) It's inexcusable that someone would use his status as a teacher and a role model to proselytize on behalf of his own doctrine of intolerance, and I hope he never gets another opportunity to pass his example along to anyone else. I also hope that Leslie Frazier and Rick Spielman take a good look in the mirror and ask themselves if they are the people they truly profess themselves to be. \n \n Some will ask why I waited so long to tell this story. It's a fair question, and I have two answers. The first is that I still have friends on the Vikings, and opening up something like this during the season would not help them focus on their jobs. By doing it now, I hope they don't have to answer questions about an issue that concerns only four people, and I hope the issue will have died down before next season starts. \n \n The second is that I wanted to prove I still had the physical ability to compete in the NFL. I can still hit the ball 45 yards outside the numbers with good hangtime, and at the tryouts I've had this year I've gotten praise from the scouts and personnel people on hand, but for whatever reason I cannot find a job. (Side note: My numbers from last year would put me right in the middle of the pack for this year, and I've traditionally been in the middle to top third of punters each year). \n \n Advertisement \n \n However, it's clear to me that no matter how much I want to prove I can play, I will no longer punt in the NFL, especially now that I've written this account. Whether it's my age, my minimum veteran salary, my habit of speaking my mind, or (most likely) a combination of all three, my time as a football player is done. Punters are always replaceable, at least in the minds of those in charge, and I realize that in advocating noisily for social change I only made it easier for them to justify not having me around. So it goes. \n \n Some will ask if the NFL has a problem with institutionalized homophobia. I don't think it does. I think there are homophobic people in the NFL, in all positions, but that's true for society as well, and those people eventually get replaced. All we can do is try to expose their behavior when we see it and call them to account for their actions. \n \n Thank you for taking the time to read my story. Never be afraid to do what's right. If no one ever says anything, nothing ever changes. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \u2014Chris Kluwe, former NFL player \n \n tl;dr\u2014It's been a fun eight years; sometimes people do crappy things to each other. \n \n Update, 6:37 p.m.: Vikings say they'll investigate | Mike Priefer responds \n \n Advertisement \n \n See also: \"They Won't Magically Turn You Into A Lustful Cockmonster\": Chris Kluwe Explains Gay Marriage To A Politician \n \n Chris Kluwe spent eight years as the Vikings punter.

Researchers who dissected Tushi's actions have concluded she planned the attack, sort of like a human would. \n \n In a study recently published in the journal Primates, Jan van Hooff and Bas Lukkenaar re-examine the events of April 10, when a Dutch TV crew was using a camera-equipped drone to film a documentary of chimpanzees at a 1.7-acre enclosure at the Royal Burgers Zoo in Arnhem. \n \n Some of the chimps grabbed branches or twigs from willow trees and two females, Tushi and Raime, climbed up on scaffolding. \n \n As the drone got close, Tushi swatted at it twice with a 6-foot-long branch she brandished in her left hand.

The sequence of events, they say, suggests the attack was \"planned\" and \"deliberate.\" \n \n \"This episode adds to the indications that chimpanzees engage in forward planning of tool-use acts,\" they write. ||||| Incident shows that chimps are able to plan ahead and use tools as weapons \n \n New York | Heidelberg, 3 September 2015 \n \n Cool. Calm. And oh, so calculated. That\u2019s how a chimpanzee living in the Royal Burgers\u2019 Zoo in the Netherlands set out to swat an aerial drone that was filming her group. In an article in the journal Primates published by Springer, Jan van Hooff and Bas Lukkenaar explain it as yet another example of chimpanzees\u2019 make-do attitude to using whatever is on hand as tools. \n \n \n \n \n \n The incident happened earlier this year, on 10 April, when a Dutch television crew was filming at the zoo in Arnhem. The idea was to use a drone to film the chimpanzees in their compound from different close-up angles. The drone already caught the chimpanzees\u2019 attention during a practice run. Some grabbed willow twigs off the ground, while four animals took these along when they climbed up scaffolding where the drone was hovering. This behavior is not frequently observed among these chimps. \n \n \n \n \n \n Filming started when the next drone flew over. It zoomed in on two chimpanzees, the females Tushi and Raimee. They were still seated on the scaffolding holding on to twigs that were about 180 cm (ca. six feet) long. Tushi made two long sweeps with hers \u2013 the second was successful in downing the drone and ultimately broke it. Before and during the strike, she grimaced. Although her face was tense and her teeth were bared, she showed no signs of fear. This suggests that she quite deliberately and forcefully struck at the drone, rather than fearfully or reflexively. \n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cThe use of the stick as a weapon in this context was a unique action,\u201d comments van Hooff. \u201cIt seemed deliberate, given the decision to collect it and carry it to a place where the drone might be attacked.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n \u201cThis episode adds to the indications that chimpanzees engage in forward planning of tool-use acts,\u201d Lukkenaar says, explaining the broader significance of the filmed event. This incident also shows the apes cautiously inspecting the contraption and even throwing it around before they lose interest in it. \n \n \n \n \n \n According to van Hooff and Lukkenaar, the chimpanzees housed at the Royal Burgers Zoo have never explicitly been taught how to use different tools, but have had ample chance to watch humans handle all kinds of implements. Previous studies showed that the chimps at this Dutch zoo spontaneously and innovatively use up to 13 types of tools in a variety of ways, especially utilizing sticks of different sizes. The apes appear to choose the size, shape and weight of the tools with a particular use in mind. Sticks are, for instance, used to gather fresh leaves from overhead branches, while heavy pieces of wood and stones are chosen as throwing weapons. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n References: \n \n 1.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A chimpanzee that famously knocked a flying drone out of the air with a stick earlier this year wasn't reacting out of fear or annoyance but rather executing a pre-planned and deliberate attack. That's according to a new study in Primates. \"This episode adds to the indications that chimpanzees engage in forward planning of tool-use acts,\" researcher Bas Lukkenaar says in a press release. The Christian Science Monitor reports a Dutch TV crew was using the drone to film a documentary on the chimps at the Royal Burgers' Zoo in April. After a test-run with the drone, the chimps started collecting sticks and climbing scaffolding. When the drone returned, a chimp named Tushi was ready, swiping it out of the air with a 6-foot branch. While studying footage from the busted drone, researchers focused on Tushi's facial expression during the attack, NBC News reports. They found the grimace she makes before and during the incident is similar to what humans do while carrying out a predetermined use of force. According to the press release, the lack of fear in Tushi's expression means she wasn't simply attacking out of reflex. The Monitor explains it's the difference between a calculated plan and swatting at a mosquito. This isn't unusual behavior for the chimps at Burgers' Zoo; they've taught themselves to use 13 different types of tools, the press release states. (Now find out how chimps are more advanced than humans.)",

In the 911 recording, the caller cryptically asks the dispatcher for help getting out of a \"bad situation.\" \n \n Under questioning from the dispatcher, the woman describes a boss who carries a gun, sent her to get plastic surgery, tells her she can leave anytime she wants \u2014 but threatens to kill her if she does. \n \n Kenndric Roberts, 33, faces charges of false imprisonment and trafficking a person for labor. He was in jail with an initial court appearance scheduled for Thursday. It was not immediately clear if he had an attorney who could comment on the charges. \n \n \"What we believe is he was luring these women to this house with promises of either modeling careers or financial assistance. We're not 100 percent sure on that. The investigation is continuing,\" Sandy Springs police Sgt. Sam Worsham told WSB-TV. \n \n As the dispatcher learns more about what's happening, her surprise is clear, her tone at times incredulous: \"Wait.

One of the girls?\" \n \n \"No, our boss.\" \n \n \"Your boss?\" \n \n The woman says she knows her boss only as \"Ken something,\" that she met him online and that it initially seemed like a good situation because she could make money for dancing. When she arrived about a month ago, he sent her to get plastic surgery, she told the dispatcher. \n \n The situation quickly turned bad: \"He's, like, so mean I just can't stay.\" \n \n She describes the home as \"a very nice house\" in a gated subdivision, with cameras inside. According to Fulton County property records, the two-story brick home measures 6,806 square feet and is valued at $976,300. \n \n Her boss also lives in the house, drives a lot of different cars and generally has a handgun with him, she told the dispatcher. \n \n Throughout the 14-minute 911 recording, the woman repeatedly says nothing illegal is going on but that she's scared to leave. \n \n \"Does he know holding someone against their will is against the law?\" the dispatcher asks. \n \n \"He is so smart. He knows exactly what he's doing,\" the woman said. \"He'll be like, 'You can leave whenever you want,' and then he'll, like, threaten you right after.\" \n \n There were seven other women in the home, she said, but she was the only one who wanted to leave. \n \n The woman told the dispatcher she was planning to run out of the house and call a car to come pick her up and take her to the airport because she had to catch a flight home to Orlando, Florida, that friends got for her. \n \n The woman asks the dispatcher to have officers pull up in front of the house and that she'll go out to meet them. ||||| The voice was calm and quiet and desperate: \"I'm in a very bad situation, and I need to get out.\" \n \n The caller, a 20-year-old woman, told a Georgia dispatcher that she was being held against her will. And it wasn't just her. \n \n \"It's a house full of girls and ... if I try to leave, he'll try to kill me and stuff,\" she said, prompting the dispatcher to ask, \"Wait \u2014 did you say you're in a house full of girls?\" \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed 911 Call Leads To Human Trafficking Rescue 1:21 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n The caller's Tuesday morning plea helped Georgia authorities to uncover what they believe is a case of human trafficking based out of a $1 million luxury home in the suburbs of Atlanta. The suspect, Kenndric Roberts, 33, was charged with additional felonies Friday, Sandy Springs police told NBC News. \n \n Roberts faces five counts of false imprisonment, five counts of trafficking persons for labor and two counts for possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. An AK-47 and a Glock .45-caliber handgun were found in the home, police said. Possible federal charges are also pending. \n \n In total, eight women ranging from ages 19 to 22 were found at the home, said Sgt. Sam Worsham. \n \n Roberts was renting the residence, Worsham added, and the homeowners weren't there. The president of the local homeowners association told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the group had received complaints from neighbors about cars constantly \"coming in and out.\" \n \n It's unclear how long some of the women were allegedly held at the home, which is listed as having five bedrooms and five-and-a-half bathrooms.

From Chicago to New England, February was actually hot in many parts of country. Daffodils and flowering trees have been blooming for weeks . So far in 2017, it\u2019s been in the 60s or 70s as often as it\u2019s snowed in New York City. \n \n That\u2019s all about to change this week. \n \n One of the biggest March snowstorms on record appears poised to strike the East Coast on Monday night, packing strong winds and snow drifts measured in feet. It\u2019s as if Mother Nature decided to make up for lost time and pack an entire season\u2019s worth of winter into a single day. \n \n A blizzard warning is now in effect for a large swath of the Northeast from Philadelphia to Portland, Maine, including New York City \u2014 meaning white-out conditions and tropical-storm-force winds are likely. A relatively sharp cutoff between snow and slush should keep the biggest snow totals away from Washington, D.C. and Boston, but elsewhere, totals will rack up to 1 or 2 feet. The latest National Weather Service forecasts show a wide section of the Northeast, from Maryland to Maine , on tap for more than a foot of snow. Snowflakes should start Monday evening around Washington, D.C. and reach their peak early morning on Tuesday in New York City before tapering off by Tuesday evening across New England. The storm will be a relatively fast-mover, with most of its energy concentrated into a period of about nine hours of heavy snow and strong winds at each location. \n \n Besides heavy snow and strong winds gusting to nearly hurricane-force in parts of Massachusetts, the storm may bring at least moderate coastal flooding to parts of the New Jersey shore. The result will be a snow day for sure on Tuesday with schools and workplaces closed\u2014the National Weather Service is warning that \u201cseveral roads may become impassable\u201d and those that travel should bring along a \u201cwinter survival kit.\u201d NYC schools will be closed; the governor of Connecticut has issued a statewide travel ban. With leaves already out due to the early spring, there\u2019s also a risk of widespread power outages . An experimental winter storm severity index used by the National Weather Service maxes out the scale: \n \n While the effects on land may be astounding for at least a short while\u2014words like paralyzing and crippling are being used to describe it\u2014meteorologists are also viewing the storm as eye candy and refer to its weather maps as \u201c art. \u201d \n \n From a weather nerd-out standpoint, the storm is close to perfection. The primary ingredients\u2014a cold pulse from the Great Lakes and a low-pressure system forming off the Carolinas\u2014will pull in subtropical moisture from a record-warm Gulf Stream right offshore . The storm will rapidly strengthen \u2014in the process becoming a meteorological \u201cbomb \u201d ( a technical term for rapidly strengthening low-pressure centers)\u2014and travel over the sweet spot to maximize snowfall for New York City and New England. That\u2019s forced meteorologists to add new colors to their weather maps, and marvel at an \u201c absolute crusher \u201d that will be \u201c puking snow .\u201d An objective pattern-matching algorithm has compared this storm to some of the all-time strongest, too, including the Valentine\u2019s Day 2007 blizzard and 1993\u2019s \u201cStorm of the Century.\u201d \n \n There\u2019s even a good chance of thundersnow\u2014the meteorological Holy Grail, made infamous by a viral Weather Channel video from 2011 in Chicago. \n \n If you\u2019re wondering, \u201cbut, it\u2019s March\u2014how is this happening?\u201d\u2014that\u2019s a good question. If the current forecast\u2014which was boosted early Monday morning by the National Weather Service\u2014pans out, the storm will rank as the second-biggest March snowstorm in New York City history (records go back to 1869). Two studies published last year argue that climate change may be making the ingredients for big East Coast snowstorms more likely, and the evidence is starting to mount: Including this storm, eight of the 10 biggest snowstorms in New York City have occurred since 1996. High-resolution weather models continue to insist that most of this storm\u2019s snowfall will come during just a few hours via an intense band with snowfall rates of up to 5 inches per hour\u2014near the upper limit of what is physically possible along the East Coast. ||||| FILE- In this March 10, 2017, file photo, pedestrians walk through wet snow in the Brooklyn borough of New York.

They also have argued that the true intention of the law is to stop or limit Muslim refugee resettlement in Tennessee. \n \n Stephanie Teatro, co-executive director of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition, said the group was disappointed the governor didn't veto the measure, which she called constitutionally suspect. \n \n \"As the global refugee crisis persists, we urge Governor Haslam to act with greater moral authority and courageous leadership,\" she said in a statement. \"We must counter fear and discrimination toward people fleeing persecution and provide greater investment in the life-saving work of refugee resettlement programs.\" \n \n Fears about refugees in Tennessee came into focus after terrorist attacks last year in Paris and San Bernardino, California. Supporters say the lawsuit is necessary because they believe refugees are not being properly vetted by President Barack Obama's administration. \n \n Alabama and Texas have sued the federal government over the refugee rights program. \n \n Tennessee pulled out of the federal refugee resettlement program in 2008, Andrea Helling, a spokeswoman for the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, said in an email. Catholic Charities of Tennessee has been administering the program since that time, she said. \n \n \"Since the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, over 3 million refugees from more than 70 countries have been given safe haven in the U.S., along with the possibility of a new beginning, and freedom from persecution and displacement,\" Helling said. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press Writer Sheila Burke contributed to this report. ||||| (Photo: WKRN) \n \n NASHVILLE, Tenn.

    "document": "Why The Mali Coup Threatens All Of West Africa \n \n Following the March 22 coup that ousted President Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9, the north of Mali is in the hands of a Tuareg rebellion. It is a rolling series of events that has leaders across the region worrying about similar threats. \n \n by: admin Tuaregs, like this man in Algeria, live in several different countries in North and West Africa (Garrondo) \n \n LE MONDE/Worldcrunch \n \n The very existence of the West African country of Mali is currently under threat. The whole of the north of the country is in the hands of a Tuareg rebellion, which nothing seems able to stop. \n \n President Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9 was ousted on March 22 by a junta of captains calling themselves the National Council for the Recovery of Democracy and the Restoration of the State (CNRDRE). Taking advantage of the ensuing power vacuum in the capital Bamako, the rebels have gained possession of northern Mali at lightning speed. \n \n The rebels, the majority of whom are members of the nomadic Tuareg people, refuse to be called Malian, and they want to establish an independent Tuareg state called Azawad. \n \n Currently the rebels only hold the northern part of Mali, but with potential reinforcements arriving from other areas of the Sahel, a transition zone between the Sahara in the north and the savannahs to the south, and in particular from neighboring Niger, that could all change. In the meantime, the Malian army is falling apart. \n \n The captains who overthrew the president justified their actions by claiming to be working to end the decline of Mali. However, the coup has had precisely the opposite outcome. Despite the fall of city after city in the north over the past few days, the CNRDRE has not sent any troops north to defend the country from the rebels. \n \n Quick response, deep concerns \n \n West African leaders are responding quickly to try and avoid an outright collapse of the Malian state, and they have reacted with commendable promptness. At the impetus of, in particular, Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, a diplomatic emergency committee has been formed that is threatening the junta with heavy sanctions if it does not relinquish power. \n \n However, none of the heads of states involved is entirely blameless. Some, like Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaor\u00e9, have faced mutinies in their own countries. The desire of the presidents of the region to return constitutional order to Bamako is therefore influenced by a certain degree of self-preservation. Who can blame them? Only recently emerging from the Ivorian crisis, with Guinea still fragile and Senegal only just managing to avoid serious upheaval following its electoral turmoil, West Africa could do without the collapse of Mali. \n \n In Bamako, regional pressures run counter to public opinion; Mali has developed a strong dislike for its neighbors\u2019 interference. But at this stage the only options left are likely to be hard to implement, not least the junta stepping down as Sanago, president of CNRDRE, holds tight to power. \n \n The West African heads of state will need plenty more energy to achieve their joint objectives: firstly, getting the Malian military back to their barracks; and secondly, helping them to launch a counter-attack. If this doesn\u2019t happen, the North will quickly be lost and the division of the country becomes an ever-growing threat. \n \n Until now, West Africa\u2019s efforts have met with relative indifference from the international community. It is imperative that the outside world offers its support and realizes that the situation in Mali will have significant consequences for the whole of the Sahel region. \n \n Read more from Le Monde in French. \n \n Photo \u2013 Garrondo \n \n All rights reserved \u00a9Worldcrunch - in partnership with Le Monde ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Timbuktu's mud and wood architecture is unique \n \n The fighting in northern Mali could damage the World Heritage Site of Timbuktu, the UN's cultural agency Unesco has warned. \n \n Timbuktu's \"outstanding architectural wonders\" must be safeguarded, it said. \n \n Separatist Tuareg rebels joined forces with Islamist fighters to take the town on Sunday, and residents have told the BBC that Islamic law is being imposed. \n \n The African Union has joined West African nations in imposing sanctions on Mali after a recent coup. \n \n Meanwhile, representatives from the new military leadership are in Nigeria for talks with the authorities. \n \n The military junta overthrew Mali's government nearly two weeks ago, saying the campaign against the recent Tuareg rebellion had been poorly run. \n \n Junta head Capt Amadou Sanogo has said the army is not leaving power, but has promised to consult local political forces to set up a transition body \"with the aim of organising peaceful, free, open and democratic elections in which we will not take part\". \n \n 'Bars ransacked' \n \n Correspondents say long lines have formed at petrol stations in the capital, Bamako, in response to sanctions. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Timbuktu mayor Halle Cisse: \"We don't know who's in charge\" \n \n A farmer, who was filling up 15 jerry cans with diesel, told the BBC that he was worried about not being able to irrigate his crops with a generator once fuel reserves run out. \n \n Landlocked Mali has to import all its fuel - and reporters say the country will struggle to survive an economic blockade. \n \n But the Tuareg rebels have taken advantage of the political situation and made rapid advances in the past few days - and now control of a third of the West African country, including the key northern towns of Gao, Kidal and Timbuktu. \n \n Timbuktu's literary patrimony... reveals a continent with an immensely rich literary and scientific heritage Writer Lydia Syson Why do we know Timbuktu? \n \n The rebels are divided into two groups - the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad (MNLA), which wants independence for the northern Tuareg homelands, while Ansar Dine, which is linked to the North African branch of al-Qaeda, wants to remain part of Mali but impose Sharia. \n \n Residents in Gao and Kidal told the BBC that Islamist fighters have ransacked bars serving alcohol and banned Western music on local airwaves. \n \n In Timbuktu, people told the BBC that Ansar Dine members are going from door-to-door telling occupants that they now have to live by the principles of Islamic law. \n \n The BBC's Alou Diawara in the capital, Bamako, says some civilians are fleeing the central town of Mopti, fearing a rebel advance further south. \n \n According to the UN refugee agency, since January the violence has uprooted more than 200,000 people, including around 100,000 who have fled the country. \n \n Tourist attraction \n \n Timbuktu - on the edge of the Sahara desert - is littered with impressive architecture, using mud and wood in a unique style. \n \n Structures include the great mosques of Djingareyber, Sankore and Sidi Yahia and 16 cemeteries. \n \n \"They are essential to the preservation of the identity of the people of Mali and of our universal heritage,\" Unesco head Irina Bokova said, calling on all parties to fulfil international obligations to safeguard heritage in times of war. \n \n Once an important centre of Islamic study, Timbuktu is home to about 700,000 ancient manuscripts, held in approximately 60 private libraries. \n \n \"At its zenith in the middle of the 15th Century Timbuktu was known all over the world as a repository for all sorts of knowledge, including Arabic Islamic writing, science, maths and history,\" Lydia Syson, an expert on Mali, told the BBC. \n \n Today, Timbuktu is poor and parts of it are sinking under the encroaching desert sands. \n \n Nevertheless, in recent years a lot of money has been invested in trying to preserve Timbuktu's manuscripts, some of which have already been destroyed. \n \n Many collections have been digitised and local scholars trained in how to interpret the literary treasures, most of which are family collections that have been handed down from generation to generation. \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption Ancient family manuscripts have been handed down from generation to generation \n \n The rebel takeover could disrupt these efforts and prevent access to the manuscripts. \n \n \"What is so important about Timbuktu's literary patrimony is that it is a challenge to Western ideas that Africa is a land of song and dance and oral tradition,\" Ms Syson said. \n \n \"It reveals a continent with an immensely rich literary and scientific heritage,\" she said. \n \n The UN Security Council is due to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis in Mali later on Tuesday. \n \n The coup and Tuareg rebellion have exacerbated a humanitarian crisis in Mali and some neighbouring countries, with aid agencies warning that 13 million people need food aid following a drought in the region. ||||| Malians lined up outside gas stations holding jerrycans, water bottles and plastic jugs, as the landlocked West African nation braced itself Tuesday for sanctions imposed overnight as a consequence of a coup last month. \n \n In an effort to force out the soldiers that seized control of the country on March 21, Mali's neighbors decided at an emergency summit Monday to impose an embargo, shutting their borders and freezing its account at the regional central bank. The nation roughly twice the size of France imports all its fuel, which is trucked in overland from neighboring Ivory Coast and Senegal, both located on Africa's Atlantic Coast. \n \n The country's electricity grid is also expected to falter in coming weeks. April is one of the hottest months of the year in the country located on the southern edge of the Sahara desert, and the nation's hydropower system is unable to carry the load because of low water levels. Fuel is used in the hot months to run diesel generators. \n \n Mali's president was sent into hiding when a group of disgruntled soldiers started a mutiny at a military base located around 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the presidential palace. From the base, they decided to march on the palace. In a matter of hours, they succeeded in reversing more than two decades of democracy. \n \n The Economic Community of West African States, representing 15 nations in the region, has been uncharacteristically harsh in their condemnation of the coup. They gave the putschists a 72-hour deadline to restore civilian rule, which expired Monday. When the junta failed to do so, they announced that sanctions would go into effect immediately. \n \n Bathily Seye, the owner of a local chain of gas stations called Afrique Oil, said that if no new shipments are allowed in, his 15 pumps will run dry in days. \n \n \"We don't have our own gas. It's all imported,\" he said. \"There is absolutely nothing here. We don't have any refining capacity. ... I don't have the stock. In two days, my pumps will run out of gas.\" \n \n At a Shell pump in downtown Bamako, the line of cars was so long Tuesday that the vehicles were idling on the highway leading to the station. At the front of the queue, farm employee Baba Kounta had climbed into the back of his minibus, where he was filling 12 20-liter jerrycans. He said he needs the gas to power the generators that run the irrigation system at the orange farm outside Bamako where he works. \n \n \"We don't have a choice. We're obliged to make provisions,\" said Kounta, as he watched the gauge on the pump race past 73,700 francs (around $147). \"In the hot season, the generator eats 40 liters (more than 10 gallons) per day.\" \n \n Waiting his turn behind the minibus was 50-year-old computer tech Nouhoum Kamate, who was sitting in the suffocating heat of his unventilated old-model Mercedes. A government employee, he had come to the gas station with his March paycheck. It's unclear if the junta will be able to pay civil servants in April because the country's bank account is now frozen. \n \n \"I got my salary this past month, but next month? I don't think we will get to that point,\" said Kamate. \"I think we will find a solution. They can't do this embargo forever.\" \n \n The soldiers who grabbed power said they did so because of the former president's mishandling of an insurgency in the north by Tuareg rebels. Since the coup, however, the rebels have effectively seized control of the entire northern half of the nation, taking the three major towns of Kidal, Gao and Timbuktu over the weekend. \n \n A former minister, Mohamed Ag Erlaf, identified himself as the chief negotiator for Mali's junta and said the main rebel group that seized the north is willing to hold talks on the future of the country. Reached by telephone, Erlaf said Tuesday that the rebel National Movement for the Liberation of the Azawad is open to discussions. \n \n However, an NMLA spokesman in Paris told France 24 TV late Monday that the rebels have had no direct contact with the junta which toppled Mali's government. Moussa Ag Attaher said they do not recognize coup leader Capt. Amadou Haya Sanogo. \n \n He said: \"Neither the international community nor the population of Mali recognize him. If we are to negotiate, it needs to be with someone that is recognized.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press Writer Michelle Faul contributed to this report from Niamey, Niger.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Since we last checked in, the situation in Mali following a soldiers' coup has spiraled, with rising concerns over food and gas shortages, violence, and indeed the country's \"very existence,\" according to Le Monde. An update: The coup has driven more than 200,000 people from their homes to other parts of the region, the AP reports. The UN worries that major food shortages could be imminent, and \"mayhem in these towns and cities is increasing,\" says a rep. Neighboring countries have established an embargo against the rebels who ousted the president; they've closed off their borders and frozen the country's regional bank account. That has prompted residents of Mali, which imports all its fuel, to rush to gas stations to collect fuel. The country's electricity grid may also be headed for failure. UNESCO is citing a threat to Timbuktu, a World Heritage Site full of \"architectural wonders,\" notes the BBC. Mosques there are \"essential to the preservation of the identity of the people of Mali,\" says the group. Yet \"nothing seems to be able to stop\" the Tuareg coup, Le Monde reports.

He suggested that a possible solution might be to start a tunnel-digging firm called \u2014 wait for it \u2014 The Boring Company, following it up by saying \u201cI am actually going to do this,\u201d and updating his bio to read: \u201cTesla, SpaceX, Tunnels & OpenAI.\u201d This morning, he repeated the claim, and even assured a questioner that he was, in fact, serious. \n \n Exciting progress on the tunnel front.

Or it\u2019s just a joke \u2014 related, perhaps, to Trump\u2019s plans to build a border wall with Mexico.

The hand-held devices have been modified to carry all manner of harmful things, like knives and firecrackers, becoming more weapon than toy. \n \n In Germany, customs officials confiscated 35 tons of spinners in May. There was no clear indication of who made them, said Christine Strass, a spokeswoman for the customs authority, and they posed a danger to young children, who could swallow small parts like the ball bearings that make the toys spin. \n \n Although some therapists have said that the spinners help people with attention disorders, various schools in the United States have banned them as a distraction. \n \n The toy seemed to achieve cult status recently after the comedy show \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d produced a spoof advertisement for a diamond-encrusted fidget spinner from Cartier. ||||| Not everyone gets fidget spinners.

He noted schoolchildren and college students were using the devices in Russia, where the trend was at its peak, unlike in the West where it was apparently waning. \n \n \u201cAs you can see here there is only writing in English, on the other side there is not a word in Russian,\u201d Nikolay Sokolov, Kazakov\u2019s co-anchor chimed in, brandishing a new fidget spinner. He underlined the lack of medical evidence that the item had many benefits but that the interest in it among scientists \u201cis not big.\u201d \n \n \u201cWhy the spinner has become so popular in Russia now is a mystery,\u201d Sokolov said. \u201cWho could be promoting it en masse?\u201d \n \n According to Sokolov, fidget spinners were being distributed at opposition leader Alexey Navalny\u2019s last rally on June 12 \n \n Russian independent journalist Alexey Kovalev was among the first to draw attention to the initial bizarre segments on Russian national airwaves, tweeting his response. \n \n Fidget spinners are used by opposition to pacify followers and distract them from real issues.

    "document": "Based on reporting by RFE/RL, AP, and dpa \n \n Afghanistan's President Hamid Karzai has assigned a team to investigate claims by the United Nations that prisoners in government custody were being tortured and abused.A presidential office statement on January 22 said the delegation will \"fully investigate the claims of torture, mistreatment, death threats, and sexual abuse\" in detention facilities.The statement said the delegation should report back to Karzai within two weeks \"so that follow-up measures can be taken.\"In a report issued on January 20, thethat \"torture persists and remains a serious concern in numerous detention facilities across Afghanistan.\"The report said that such practices continue despite efforts by the United Nations and international forces during the past year.Afghan authorities have denied the UN report's claims. ||||| The Afghan government has set up a delegation to investigate reports of torture in Afghan-run detention facilities. \n \n \n \n The delegation, which was announced on Tuesday, was created two days after the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan published a report on the \"ill-treatment of conflict-related detainees in Afghan custody.\" \n \n \n \n The fact-finding team - including advisors from the interior ministry and the National Directorate of Security, the Afghan intelligence agency, which were both implicated in the report - will be \"tasked to fully investigate the claims of torture, mistreatment, death threats and sexual abuse in prisons, and any faults or misconduct during questioning and trial of detainees.\" \n \n \n \n The UN report, based on interviews with hundreds of detainees held in 89 facilities between October 2011 and October 2012, details 14 abusive practices, including the twisting of genitals, extracting fingernails and electric shock. \n \n \n \n Perhaps most damning is a statement by an unnamed operative within the agency, who is quoted as saying \"NDS has several secret places in which they detain and torture people.\" \n \n \n \n Conflicted relationship \n \n \n \n The response to the allegations has highlighted the conflicted relationship that Afghan officials have with international agencies. \n \n The initial response upon the report's January 20 publication was denial. An NDS official, speaking to Al Jazeera on condition of anonymity, called the claims against the intelligence agency baseless. \n \n \"People say they were beaten, but where are the bruises? If we rip out people's fingernails, then show the scars. Prove it,\" the official said, adding that the NDS only detains \"the enemies of Afghanistan.\" \n \n \"When people manage to speak to them alone, the stories change. They are looking to defend themselves, so they make up these false stories.\" \n \n The official argued that the 635 detainees interviewed by the UN were duped by a \"welcoming war\" of words by critics of the Afghan government, an increasingly common narrative in Kabul. \n \n These doubts were echoed by Aimal Faizi, a presidential spokesman. \"While the Afghan government takes very seriously the allegations made in the UN report, we also question the motivations behind this report and the way it was conducted,\" he said. \n \n When asked about the claim in the report that \"all tortured detainees were taken out of their cells... and they were transferred to another building inside the same compound to hide them,\" the NDS official said countless groups have observed the agency's practices. \"Anyone we interrogate, we document it all. Everything we've done is in writing.\" \n \n Both the official and Faizi pointed to \"numerous groups\" that have observed the conditions in Afghan-run detention facilities to question the findings of the report. \n \n A tweet sent by Faizi only hours after the report's publication said \"the Red Cross and human rights groups have full access to all our detention facilities and the detainees within these facilities.\" \n \n \"Why would we torture? It doesn't work. I was arrested by the communists. The more they tortured, the less it made me want to speak. \" - NDS official speaking to Al Jazeera \n \n \n \n In a statement to Al Jazeera, the International Committee of the Red Cross said they have \"good access to detention facilities in Afghanistan and good collaboration with Afghan and international military forces in the country.\" \n \n Robin Waudo, a communications coordinator, said \"if the [Red Cross] delegates witness ill-treatment first-hand while being present at a detention facility anywhere in the world, they would in every case intervene immediately and urge the authorities to put an end to it.\" \n \n But Sayed Mohammad Saeeq Shajjan, a Harvard law graduate now running a law firm in Kabul, said when legal and rights groups observe the conditions in the facilities, it is a closely monitored and guided process. \n \n The president's commission, which will conduct a two-week investigation, will \"also not find anything,\" Shajjan said. \"They will only speak in front of NDS authorities, to people they are confident will not speak up against the detention authorities.\" \n \n A Kabul-based judge, speaking on condition of anoymity, because he is not authorised to speak to the media, agreed. \n \n \"The NDS utilises not one, but several abusive methods to obtain information. But there is nothing we can do, no one is allowed to interfere, especially in terrorism-related cases,\" the judge said. \n \n Arrest first \n \n Shajjan said he has heard repeated stories of torture methods being used for false confessions in cases based on false accusations. \n \n He recalled one client, Shah Mahmood, who turned to show Shajjan where the blood would drip from on his back after being lashed by ropes. \"During his detention in Takhar, he was tortured badly, he was beaten with ropes, slapped and punched,\" Shajjan said. \n \n Unarmed at the time of his arrest, Shah Mahmood, an Uzbek, was accused of being a member of the Taliban by a district governor in northern Takhar province. \n \n \"The district governor wanted Shah Mahmood to divorce his wife, who was known for her beauty. After demanding he divorce his wife three times, the district governor, who wanted to marry Shah Mahmood's wife, accused Shah Mahmood of being part of the Taliban.\" \n \n Shah Mahmood spent nine months in NDS detention where he was beaten on a daily basis until he would confess to being a member of the group. \n \n In another case, Shajjan said, Asef, a Kabul resident, \"was deprived of his sleep, beaten with cables, received electric shocks and hanged from his hands for anywhere from three to 12 hours at a time\" while in NDS custody. \n \n The torture led to a false confession and a 16-year sentence on allegations Asef had planted explosives in the house of a neighbour he was having a civil dispute with. \n \n Another detainee reported threats of sexual abuse using bottles if they do not confess, a practice documented in the latest UNAMA report. \n \n Like Shah Mahmood and Asef, Shajjan said many in NDS custody are innocent, but \"they always arrest first and ask later\". \n \n Follow Ali M Latifi on Twitter: @alibomaye",

    "document": "Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n NEW YORK \u2014 In a stunning lawsuit seeking to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for 9/11, the families of 800 victims have filed a lawsuit accusing the Saudis of complicity in the worst terror attacks on American soil. \n \n The legal action, filed in federal court in Manhattan, details a scenario of involvement by Saudi officials who are said to have aided some of the hijackers before the attacks. \n \n Fifteen of the 19 hijackers were Saudi nationals and three of them had previously worked for the kingdom. \n \n The document details how officials from Saudi embassies supported hijackers Salem al-Hazmi and Khalid Al-Mihdhar 18 months before 9/11. \n \n The officials allegedly helped them find apartments, learn English and obtain credit cards and cash. The documents state that the officials helped them learn how to blend into the American landscape. \n \n The suit also produces evidence that officials in the Saudi embassy in Germany supported lead hijacker Mohamed Atta. It claims that a Saudi official was in the same hotel in Virginia with several hijackers the night before the attacks. \n \n Many of the revelations in the lawsuit are culled from findings of an FBI investigation into the terrorist attacks. The suit filed by aviation law firm Kreindler & Kreindler claims some of the hijackers had special markers in their passports, identifying them as al-Qaida sympathizers. \n \n The lawsuit asserts that the Saudi royals, who for years had been trying to curry favor with fundamentalists to avoid losing power, were aware that funds from Saudi charities were being funneled to al-Qaida. \n \n Aviation attorney Jim Kreindler told PIX11 News: \u201cThe charities were alter egos of the Saudi government.\u201d \n \n The lawsuit spells out how money was transferred from charities in Saudi Arabia to the terror group. \n \n Charities the lawsuit claims fronted for al-Qaida include the Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, an organization that was designated by the U.S. as a sponsor of terrorism. \n \n Kreindler maintains that there was a direct link between all the charities and Osama bin Laden and that they operated with the full knowledge of Saudi officials. \n \n The legal document claims that the Saudis used a variety of means to conceal the money trail to al-Qaida. \n \n \u201cThe Saudis were so duplicitous,\u201d Kreindler said. \u201cThey claim to be allies fighting with U.S. against Iran, while at the same time working with the terrorists. There\u2019s no question they had a hand in the 9/11 attacks.\u201d \n \n Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama had resisted efforts to hold Saudi Arabia accountable. The kingdom is a key ally against Iran, and its oil interests are important to the United States. \n \n Last September, Congress overrode an Obama veto to pass JASTA \u2014 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act \u2014 that would allow Americans to take legal action against countries that support terrorism. \n \n Kreindler wouldn\u2019t put a dollar figure on the amount of damages being sought by the 800 families of those who died and 1,500 first responders and others who suffered because of the attacks. \n \n \"This lawsuit is a demonstration of the unwavering commitment of the 9/11 families to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for its critical role in the 9/11 attacks,\" Kreindler said. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Alex Johnson \n \n At least seven lawsuits alleging Saudi government support and funding for the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks have landed in federal courts in the six months since Congress opened the door to such litigation over the fierce opposition of former President Barack Obama. \n \n A suit consolidating some of those actions was filed Monday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, representing the families and estates of about 800 of the 2,996 people killed in the attacks. \n \n It alleges that the Saudi government helped pay for the operation through its alleged funding of al-Qaeda terrorist camps and its logistical support for the group's transport of weapons, people and money around the world. \n \n The suit, which doesn't specify damages, alleges that the money and support were channeled through nine Saudi government-supported charities \u2014 including the Saudi Red Crescent Authority, part of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. \n \n Few if any of the allegations, many of which mirror accusations in other lawsuits filed since September, appear to be new, but they add details to the assertions of 9/11 victims' families that elements of the Saudi government, one of the United States' closest allies in the Middle East, secretly backed the attacks. \n \n For example, the consolidated suit alleges that officials in Saudi embassies helped some of the hijackers find homes and learn English so they could pass unnoticed in the United States. \n \n It alleges that Saudi authorities even applied a secret code to the passports of al-Qaeda members to facilitate their international travel and that such codes were discovered on the passports of at least three of the 9/11 terrorists. \n \n The lawsuits began rushing into the courts after Sept. 28, when Congress overrode Obama's veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, which provided an exemption to the legal principle of sovereign immunity so families could take the Saudi government to court. \n \n Firefighters and rescue workers undrape a large U.S. flag near a damaged area of the Pentagon on Sept. 12, 2001. Larry Downing / Reuters \n \n The Obama administration argued that providing the exemption would set a dangerous precedent, opening the door for other countries and their citizens to haul the United States into court. \n \n Most of the actions brought since the veto was overridden are on behalf of families of victims of the attack on the World Trade Center. One was brought by insurance companies seeking to recoup some of their losses. \n \n On Friday, a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan ordered lawyers for the plaintiffs and for Saudi Arabia to appear in court this Thursday to try to work out a way to coordinate the various cases. \n \n A representative for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia could not be reached for comment on Monday evening. Country officials in the past have said they cannot comment on pending legislation. ||||| Senate Committee Any Committee Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry (70th-116th) Armed Services (79th-116th) Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs (70th-116th) Budget (93rd-116th) Commerce, Science, and Transportation (79th-116th) Energy and Natural Resources (70th-116th) Environment and Public Works (79th-116th) Finance (70th-116th) Foreign Relations (70th-116th) Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (70th-116th) Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (70th-116th) Judiciary (70th-116th) Rules and Administration (79th-116th) Small Business and Entrepreneurship (81st-116th) Veterans' Affairs (91st-116th) \n \n State or Territory Indicated Any State or Territory Alabama Alaska American Samoa Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Florida Georgia Guam Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York North Carolina North Dakota Northern Mariana Islands Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Puerto Rico Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont Virgin Islands Virginia Washington West Virginia Wisconsin Wyoming \n \n Nomination Actions Any Nomination Action Placed on calendar as privileged nomination Committee requested information was received Referred to committee Hearings held Ordered reported Reported to Senate Committee discharged Placed on calendar Placed on calendar with footnote Considered by Senate Unanimous consent agreement Cloture motion Cloture invoked/not invoked Rereferred to committee Received message of withdrawal Returned to president Confirmed by Senate ||||| CLOSE The lawsuit, brought in the federal court that covers lower Manhattan, is years in the making.

The charities worked with late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to open offices in Pakistan and Afghanistan and establish the terrorist organization, the suit alleges. \n \n The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia directly funded al-Qaeda, the lawyer said. Saudi Arabia supported the terrorists by supplying assistance such as passports and worldwide transportation, he said. \n \n And finally, the suit identifies Saudi officials who worked with the hijackers in Los Angeles, San Diego, Sarasota, Fla., Washington, D.C., and Virginia in the 18 months leading up to the attacks, Kreindler said. \n \n In September, Congress passed a measure allowing countries to be sued in terrorism cases even when the alleged act or acts take place outside of the United States \u2014 the Justice Against State Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) \u2014 which enables the suit to go forward. \n \n Another lawyer working with the plaintiffs said the families he represents are grateful to Congress and to President Trump, who has backed their efforts. \n \n \"We just hope President Trump continues,\" Andrew Maloney said. \"I would like to hear some continued expressions of support by the president.\" \n \n Michael Kellogg, a Washington-based lawyer representing the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, did not respond to a message left at his office Monday evening. \n \n CLOSE The White House blasted what it called \"rapid onset buyer's remorse\" after House and Senate leaders conceded problems with the 9/11 lawsuit bill Congress just enacted into law over President Obama's veto.

Of the 19 plane hijackers that day, 15 were Saudi nationals, and three of those reportedly had employment history with the government there. Accusations in the newest consolidated complaint, compiled in large part via an FBI investigation, include embassy officials being instrumental in assimilating some of the 9/11 attackers into the US via English instruction, funding assistance, and help in finding a place to live. Saudi authorities also allegedly offered special passport codes to a handful of the terrorists that smoothed their way into the US. The suit also says Saudi royals turned a blind eye regarding money they donated to certain \"charities,\" which was really being shifted to al-Qaeda. \"The Saudis were so duplicitous,\" aviation attorney Jim Kreindler tells WPIX, noting while Saudi Arabia was putting up a good front as a US ally, it was secretly enabling terrorism. (USA Today notes Kreindler's law firm is handling the new suit, which is seeking unspecified monetary damages.) Per NBC, more than a half-dozen lawsuits against the Saudi government have filtered into federal court since September, when Congress rejected then-President Obama's veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which gave families of 9/11 victims a way to circumvent sovereign immunity to sue the Saudis. Obama was against JASTA, saying the tables could be turned so other nations can file suit against the US. Attorneys for families and the Saudis are to appear in court Thursday to hammer out the multi-case logistics. (The Saudis obviously don't like JASTA.)",

He spent time in jail in 1997 and 2003 for parole violations arising from assault charges. He later pleaded guilty to hitting his girlfriend in an incident in 2008. \n \n While his label was initially very successful, his fortunes began to slide in 1996 when rapper Tupac Shakur was shot and killed in the passenger seat of Knight's car. \n \n In 1997, rival rapper Biggie Smalls was shot and Knight was sued for wrongful death. Smalls' estate claimed that Knight had ordered the killing in revenge for Shakur's death. Knight denied it and the suit was dismissed. \n \n What happened in the hit-and-run? \n \n The charge relates to an incident in January 2015 in Compton, a suburb of Los Angeles. \n \n Knight was accused of deliberately running over two men with his pick-up truck outside a hamburger restaurant following an argument on the set of a commercial for Straight Outta Compton. \n \n One of the victims, Terry Carter, died of his injuries while the other, Cle \"Bone\" Sloan, suffered serious injuries to his feet and head. \n \n Footage of the incident captured by security cameras show Knight's vehicle pulling up to the drive-in shop, with one of the victims approaching the driver's side window. Following what appears to be a brief discussion, a struggle then ensues. \n \n Knight's truck is seen going into reverse, throwing the man to the ground. It then moves forward, driving over his legs and slams into the other victim, who was killed. \n \n Knight turned himself in to authorities a day after the incident.

But while the CDC will have the freedom to resume work on that topic, it's still unclear whether it will have the funding to do so. \n \n \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Here's the relevant part from the White House fact sheet, under action No. 14, titled clearly as \"Issue a Presidential Memorandum directing the Centers for Disease Control to research the causes and prevention of gun violence\": \n \n \n \n Conduct research on the causes and prevention of gun violence, including links between video games, media images, and violence: The President is issuing a Presidential Memorandum directing the Centers for Disease Control and scientific agencies to conduct research into the causes and prevention of gun violence. It is based on legal analysis that concludes such research is not prohibited by any appropriations language. The CDC will start immediately by assessing existing strategies for preventing gun violence and identifying the most pressing research questions, with the greatest potential public health impact. And the Administration is calling on Congress to provide $10 million for the CDC to conduct further research, including investigating the relationship between video games, media images, and violence. \n \n Better understand how and when firearms are used in violent death: To research gun violence prevention, we also need better data. When firearms are used in homicides or suicides, the National Violent Death Reporting System collects anonymous data, including the type of firearm used, whether the firearm was stored loaded or locked, and details on youth gun access. Congress should invest an additional $20 million to expand this system from the 18 states currently participating to all 50 states, helping Americans better understand how and when firearms are used in a violent death and informing future research and prevention strategies. \n \n As you can see in that first graph, Obama is asking Congress to pony up $10 million to fund said research. While it's unclear whether lawmakers will give him the cash he wants, regardless it appears as though those at the CDC will have the freedom to examine something that they've turned something of a blind eye to since 1996. NBC explains the back story: \n \n From the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s, the CDC conducted original, peer-reviewed research into gun violence, including questions such as whether people who had guns in their homes gained protection from the weapons. (The answer, researchers found, was no. Homes with guns had a nearly three times greater risk of homicide and a nearly five times greater risk of suicide than those without, according to a 1993 study in the New England Journal of Medicine.) \n \n But in 1996, the NRA, with the help of Congressional leaders, moved to suppress such information and to block future federal research into gun violence, [Dr. Mark Rosenberg, president of the Task Force for Global Health and director of the CDC's Center for Injury Prevention and Control from 1994 to 1999] said. \n \n The statute that governs the agency's funding stipulates that none of its federal funding can be used \"to advocate or promote gun control.\" While that never specifically blocked research into gun violence, the language was broad enough to give CDC officials pause and serve as a deterrent to inquisitive researchers. [Paul D. Thacker, a former Senate investigator, wrote about the NRA's campaign to shut down studies at the CDC in a piece for Slate back in December. You can read that here.] \n \n \n \n \"CDC overreacted to that statement and became more reluctant to fund anything dealing with guns, even the traditional epidemiological research, so there was a chilling effect,\" Stephen Teret, director for the Center for Law and the Public\u2019s Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, explained to NBC. \n \n Obama's executive order, however, should bring an end to those fears. \"[R]esearch on gun violence is not advocacy; it is critical public health research that gives all Americans information they need,\" reads the White House fact sheet. ||||| President Barack Obama on Wednesday launched the most sweeping effort to curb U.S. gun violence in nearly two decades, announcing a $500 million package that sets up a fight with Congress over bans on military-style assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines just a month after a shooting in Connecticut killed 20 school children. \n \n President Barack Obama, accompanied by Vice President Joe Biden, left, hugs eight-year-old letter writer Grant Fritz during a news conference on proposals to reduce gun violence, Wednesday, Jan. 16, 2013,...

(Associated Press) \n \n Obama signed 23 executive actions, which require no congressional approval. But the president, speaking at the White House, acknowledged the most sweeping, effective actions must be taken by lawmakers. \n \n \"To make a real and lasting difference, Congress must act,\" Obama said. \"And Congress must act soon.\" He added, \"I'll put everything that I've got into this.\" \n \n The president appealed to the nation's conscience, but his announcement promises to lead to a bitter fight with a powerful pro-gun lobby that has long warned supporters that Obama wanted to take away their guns. \n \n The U.S. has the highest rate of gun ownership of any country in the world, and pro-gun groups see any move on gun restrictions as an offense against the right guaranteed by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Critics counter that the country's founding fathers never could have foreseen assault weapons more than two centuries ago, when guns were intended for the common, not individual, defense, guns were often stored in community areas and rifles fired one laborious shot at a time. \n \n \"This is the land of the free and the home of the brave, and always will be,\" Obama said, acknowledging the right to possess and bear firearms. \"But we've also long realized ... that with rights come responsibilities.\" \n \n Obama was joined by children who wrote him letters about gun violence in the weeks following the Connecticut shooting. Families of the children killed in the shooting, as well as survivors, were also in the audience. \n \n Emotions have been high since the Connecticut shooting, which Obama has called the worst day of his presidency. He largely ignored the issue of gun violence during his first term but appears willing to stake his second term on it now. He'll have to contend with looming fiscal issues that have threatened to push whatever he proposes aside, at least for a while. \n \n Gun control advocates also worry that opposition from the powerful National Rifle Association and its allies in Congress will be too great to overcome. \n \n \"Attacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation,\" the NRA said in a statement after Obama's announcement. \"Only honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy.\" \n \n The NRA also released an online video Tuesday that called Obama an \"elitist hypocrite\" for having armed Secret Service agents protect his daughters at school while not committing to installing armed guards in all schools. The NRA insists that the best way to prevent more mass shootings is to give more \"good guys\" guns. \n \n The White House called the NRA video \"repugnant and cowardly.\" \n \n Obama's proposals are aimed at gun violence in general, not just mass shootings. He said more than 900 Americans have been killed by guns in the month since the Connecticut shooting. \n \n \"Every day we wait, the number will keep growing,\" he said. \n \n The public appears receptive to stronger federal action on guns. Nearly six in 10 Americans want stricter gun laws in the aftermath of the Connecticut shooting, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll. Three-quarters of Americans said they reacted to the Connecticut shooting with deep anger, while 54 percent said they felt deeply ashamed it could happen in the United States. \n \n The poll also shows 51 percent said they believed laws limiting gun ownership infringe on the public's right to bear firearms. \n \n White House officials, seeking to avoid setting the president up for failure, have emphasized that no single measure _ even an assault weapons ban _ would solve the scourge of gun violence. But without such a ban, or other sweeping Congress-approved measures, it's unclear whether executive actions alone can make any noticeable difference. \n \n The office of the most powerful Republican in Congress, House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, signaled no urgency to act on the proposals. \"House committees of jurisdiction will review these recommendations,\" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said. \"And if the Senate passes a bill, we will also take a look at that.\" \n \n Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a fellow Democrat, called Obama's package \"thoughtful recommendations\" and said the Senate would consider legislation addressing gun violence early this year. \n \n The president asked Congress to renew the ban on high-grade, military-style assault weapons that was first signed into law by President Bill Clinton in 1994 but expired in 2004. Obama also called for limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds or fewer, and he proposed a federal statute to stop purchases of guns by buyers who are acting for others. \n \n The president also called for a focus on universal background checks. Some 40 percent of gun sales take place without background checks, including those by private sellers at gun shows or over the Internet, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. \n \n The president's framework is based on recommendations from Vice President Joe Biden, who led a wide-ranging task force on gun violence. Beyond the gun control measures, Biden also gave Obama suggestions for improving mental health care and addressing violent images in video games, movies and television. \n \n The president also called for improvements in school safety, including putting 1,000 police officers in schools. \n \n States and cities have been moving against gun violence as well. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday signed into law the toughest gun control law in the U.S., and the first since the Connecticut shooting. The law includes a tougher assault-weapons ban and provisions to try to keep guns out of the hands of mentally ill people who make threats. \n \n The NRA criticized the bill, saying in a statement, \"These gun control schemes have failed in the past and will have no impact on public safety and crime.\" \n \n In Washington, it's unclear how much political capital Obama will use in pressing for congressional action. \n \n The White House and Congress will soon be consumed by three looming fiscal deadlines, each of which is expected to be contentious. And the top Republican in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, has warned the White House that it will be at least three months before the chamber considers gun legislation. \n \n Congress, in any case, can move slowly. The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee said Wednesday he'll begin hearings in two weeks on gun safety proposals. Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, a gun owner, said he envisions a series of hearings examining violence in popular media and how to keep guns safe, among other topics. \n \n Leahy's plan could take more time than Obama has urged. \n \n Obama's long list of executive orders includes the following: \n \n _ Ordering tougher penalties for people who lie on background checks and requiring federal agencies to make relevant data available to the federal background check system. \n \n _ Ending limits that make it more difficult for the government to research gun violence, such as gathering data on guns that fall into criminal hands. \n \n _ Requiring federal law enforcement to trace guns recovered in criminal investigations. \n \n _ Giving schools flexibility to use federal grant money to improve school safety, such as by hiring school resource officers. \n \n _ Giving communities grants to institute programs to keep guns away from people who shouldn't have them. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Julie Pace, Erica Werner, Ken Ritter, Josh Lederman Michael Gormley and Michael Virtanen contributed to this report. ||||| The White House is planning a multifaceted effort to sell its plans, including speeches around the country by the president and vice president and concerted lobbying by interest groups to influence several dozen lawmakers from both parties seen as critical to passage. The White House created a Web page with video testimonials from victims of gun violence and a sign-up for supporters to help advocate the president\u2019s plan. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cI tell you, the only way we can change is if the American people demand it,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd, by the way, that doesn\u2019t just mean from certain parts of the country. We\u2019re going to need voices in those areas, in those Congressional districts where the tradition of gun ownership is strong, to speak up and to say this is important. It can\u2019t just be the usual suspects.\u201d \n \n The N.R.A. made clear that it was ready for a fight. Even before the president\u2019s speech, it broadcast a provocative video calling Mr. Obama an \u201celitist hypocrite\u201d for opposing more armed guards in schools while his daughters had Secret Service protection. After the speech the group said it would work to secure schools, fix the mental health system and prosecute criminals but criticized the president\u2019s other proposals. \u201cAttacking firearms and ignoring children is not a solution to the crisis we face as a nation,\u201d the N.R.A. said in a statement. \u201cOnly honest, law-abiding gun owners will be affected, and our children will remain vulnerable to the inevitability of more tragedy.\u201d \n \n Mr. Obama\u2019s plan included 4 major legislative proposals and 23 executive actions that he initiated on his own authority to bolster enforcement of existing laws, improve the nation\u2019s database used for background checks and otherwise make it harder for criminals and people with mental illness to get guns. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Obama asked Congress to reinstate and strengthen a ban on the sale and production of assault weapons that passed in 1994 and expired in 2004. He also called for a ban on the sale and production of magazines with more than 10 rounds, like those used in Newtown and other mass shootings. Mr. Obama\u2019s plan would require criminal background checks for all gun sales, closing the longstanding loophole that allows buyers to avoid screening by purchasing weapons from unlicensed sellers at gun shows or in private sales. Nearly 40 percent of all gun sales are exempt from the system. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n He also proposed legislation banning the possession or transfer of armor-piercing bullets and cracking down on \u201cstraw purchasers,\u201d those who pass background checks and then forward guns to criminals or others forbidden from purchasing them. \n \n Photo \n \n For Mr. Obama, the plan represented a political pivot. While he has always expressed support for an assault weapons ban, he has made no real effort to pass it on the assumption that the votes were not there. But he and the White House are banking on the idea that the Newtown shooting has changed the dynamics. \u201cI have never seen the nation\u2019s conscience so shaken by what happened at Sandy Hook,\u201d Mr. Biden said Wednesday. \u201cThe world has changed and is demanding action.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The future of the plan may depend on how much political energy Mr. Obama puts behind it, not just to pressure Republicans but to win over Democrats who support gun rights. Even the White House considers passage of a new assault weapons ban exceedingly difficult, but there did seem to be some consensus building for expanding background checks. \n \n Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat and a longtime gun control supporter, made no mention of the assault weapons ban in a statement but pointed to the background checks. \u201cIf you look at the combination of likelihood of passage and effectiveness of curbing gun crime,\u201d he said, \u201cuniversal background checks is at the sweet spot.\u201d \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Goodlatte, Republican of Virginia, who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, dismissed an assault weapons ban as ineffective. \u201cBut in terms of background checks, in terms of keeping weapons out of the hands of criminals and people who have serious mental health difficulties, we want to do that, and we would take a close look at that,\u201d he told C-Span. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Gun control groups said they would campaign hard for the president\u2019s proposals.

(AP Photo/Rahmat Gul) (Associated Press) \n \n KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) \u2014 The three top officials in Afghanistan's Kandahar province were killed when their own guards opened fire on them at a security conference Thursday, the deputy provincial governor said, and a Taliban spokesman said the target was Washington's top general in Afghanistan, Gen. Scott Miller, who escaped without injury, according to NATO. \n \n Agha Lala Dastageri, Kandahar's deputy provincial governor, said powerful provincial police chief Abdul Raziq was among the dead, along with Kandahar Gov. Zalmay Wesa, who died of his wounds at a nearby hospital. \n \n Dastageri said provincial intelligence chief Abdul Mohmin also died inside the governor's sprawling residence where the attack occurred. \n \n Three Americans \u2014 a service member and two civilian workers \u2014 were wounded in the shooting, said U.S. Col. Knut Peters, a spokesman for NATO troops in Afghanistan. Their conditions were not immediately known. \n \n \"Gen. Miller is unhurt,\" said Peters. Miller is the commander of U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan. \n \n It was members of Wesa's elite guard unit who turned their guns on their colleagues during a high-level security meeting ahead of Saturday's parliamentary elections. \n \n Khalid Pashtun, a member of parliament from the province, said Afghan Security Forces cordoned off the area and a U.S. military helicopter circled overhead as a gun battle that began at 3 p.m. local time raged on for more than one hour. \n \n Peters said initial reports indicate one of the original attackers is dead. He had no further information. \n \n In a telephone interview, the spokesman for the Taliban in Afghanistan's southern region, Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, said the Taliban carried out the attack. He said Gen. Miller was the target and said Raziq, the governor and the intelligence chief were killed. \n \n Pashtun said an Afghan military corps commander was also among the dead, although he didn't name him. \n \n An Interior Ministry official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media said Raziq rarely visited the governor's residence and was meticulous about his own security. \n \n Razik was a particularly powerful figure in southern Kandahar and a close U.S. ally despite widespread allegations of corruption. He ruled in Kandahar, the former Taliban heartland, with an iron fist and had survived several attempts to kill him, including one last year that resulted in the death of five diplomats from the United Arab Emirates. \n \n Security has been steadily deteriorating in Afghanistan with increasingly brazen attacks being carried out by insurgents and Afghanistan's security forces have been on high alert ahead of Saturday's elections. \n \n The Taliban have threatened the polls and warned teachers and students not to participate in the vote and not to allow schools to be used as polling centers. The insurgents said in a statement Wednesday that they will target Saturday's elections, which they view as illegitimate, but that they do not want to harm civilians. \n \n Meanwhile, a NATO convoy was attacked late Wednesday near the Afghan capital, killing two civilians and injuring five Czech troops, Afghan officials and the Czech military said Thursday. \n \n The attack, which took place in the district of Bagram in Parwan province, also wounded three Afghan civilians, said Wahida Shakar, spokeswoman for the provincial governor. \n \n Bagram is about 40 kilometers (24 miles) from Kabul and is also the home of a sprawling U.S. military base \n \n The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack. \n \n Of the five Czech soldiers, one was seriously injured when their vehicle overturned following the explosion. The soldier underwent surgery and the Czech military said he was not in life-threatening condition. \n \n Earlier, NATO spokeswoman Sgt. 1st Class Debra Richardson had said three alliance service members were hurt in the bombing but didn't provide more details. \n \n Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said an insurgent suicide bomber rammed his car into the NATO convoy. \n \n The attack on the NATO convoy came at the end of a particularly violent day across Afghanistan as tensions are rising ahead of the country's parliamentary elections on Saturday. \n \n A Taliban bombing in southern Helmand province killed a candidate running in the elections. The Taliban also attacked checkpoints in the northern Baghlan province, killing six policemen and wounding two others in a four-hour battle. Also, in eastern Maidan Wardak province, a suicide car bomber targeted a military vehicle, killing two Afghan army troops. \n \n In recent months, Afghan troops have come under near-daily attacks.

He was feted as a right-wing celebrity. He got arrested for trying to sneak into a senator's office under false pretenses. And then he had his attempted prank of a CNN reporter backfire when the reporter backed out after discovering that he planned to lure her onto a boat and \"seduce\" her. O'Keefe has responded , finally, to this last embarrassment. Unsurprisingly, he has no regrets, and the liberal media is the real guilty party. \n \n O'Keefe's defense -- posted, of course, on Andrew Breitbart's \"Big Government\" -- rests on us believing that the prank-outlining document obtained by CNN was a draft that O'Keefe did not plan on actually following. He says ideas for stunts are sent to him all the time (like a fancy Hollywood producer!) and sometimes he approves of the idea behind a prank without endorsing everything about it. \n \n As you can imagine in our line of work, we get lots of leads, ideas, schemes and \u201cpunked\u201d style plans sent to us all the time. If you were to roam through my personal emails there are many outrageous plans, some parts of which I may approve of in principal with an \u201cI like it\u201d in an email thread. But I may well object to a host of things about the plan, though I like the objective. When the CNN idea was pitched to me, I\u2019ll admit that I liked the basic absurdity of meeting Abbie Boudreau on a boat and the idea of counter-seduction satire executed in a tame, humorous, non-threatening manner. After all, as all liberal reporters do, she was trying to \u201cseduce\u201d (a metaphor) me so she could get more for her story. It would be fun, I thought, to turn the tables in jest. However, I was repulsed by the over-the-top language and symbolism that was suggested in the memo that was sent to me, and never considered that for a moment. \n \n The gross document in question wasn't submitted by a fan. It was drafted by Ben Wetmore, with whom O'Keefe has worked for years. O'Keefe has called Wetmore his mentor. O'Keefe and his attempted phone-tampering buddies crashed at Wetmore's Louisiana house the month of the Landrieu office incident. \n \n The rest of O'Keefe's defense lies in still not understanding why unwanted \"seduction,\" on a boat, under false pretenses, while being secretly filmed, might not just be considered harmless fun. \n \n In my version, the reporter was never going to be placed in a threatening situation. She would have had to consent before being filmed and she was not going to be faux \u201cseduced\u201d unless she wanted to be. If a CNN reporter would be willing to engage in such a folly, it might even be more newsworthy than Rick Sanchez\u2019s firing. (CNN also has Elliot Spitzer on payroll. He\u2019s done more outrageous things than anything I\u2019ve ever gotten in my in-box). The sexually explicit document CNN is now \u201creporting\u201d on was never going to be implemented as written. She saw how I was dressed that day, with my usual blazer and collared shirt. In the document she reported as being \u201cauthentic,\u201d I was supposed to have been dressed with my chest exposed, slicked backed hair, with gold chains. That ought to have been a red flag the document was not a reflection of my true intentions. Ms. Boudreau was never going to be put in the bizarre situations outlined in the document CNN reported. There were no mirrors, sex tapes, blindfolds, fuzzy handcuffs, posters of naked women, or music. Sorry, you were not going to see my face saying the words \u201cBubble Headed Beach Blonde who comes on at 5\u201d into a video camera. Those are Don Henley lyrics \u2013 and we know, thanks to Chuck DeVore, how much Henley loathes parody. \n \n Not seduced unless she wanted to be! I mean, his \"prank\" as described here makes even less sense as a \"political\" act than the plan Wetmore wrote. He was going to lure her onto a regular boat with nothing outrageous or unusual about it, dressed conservatively, get her consent to film her, and then only \"pretend\" to \"seduce\" her if he somehow determined that she would be into that? \n \n O'Keefe accomplice Izzy Santa seemed to think -- on the day of the planned punking -- that O'Keefe's boat was full of strawberries and champagne, and that the plan was to creep Boudreau out. There's no point to getting her on the boat and filming her if you're not going to be gross. Even if O'Keefe found elements of Wetmore's idiotic script objectionable, the idea behind it remains the same. \n \n (As for O'Keefe's dress: Even if he was in his usual uniform of blazer and collared shirt that day, history suggests that footage of O'Keefe in the \"funnier\" get-up -- perhaps surrounded by \"funnier\" decor on the \"sex boat\" -- would have ended up in the completed video.) \n \n The rest of O'Keefe's post can be summarized thusly: ACORN liberal bias Planned Parenthood ACORN Charlie Rangel ACORN. ||||| Update: The video has apparently been restored.

We got Ryan and GF Shayna in NYC Saturday night and he certainly didn't shut down the possibility of hosting the show again. \n \n As we reported ... the new gig has almost super-human strings attached, requiring him to fly coast to coast twice in two days in the middle of the night each week to pull it off. Ryan seems to think he's up to the task... with an L.A. Fitness membership. \n \n BTW... we got him going in to Le Bernardin restaurant in NYC. It's super expensive, so we're guessing he's banking on \"A.I.\" money to pay the check. ||||| CLOSE The long-running music competition series \"American Idol\" is coming back for the 2017-2018 season on ABC instead of FOX. USA TODAY \n \n Original 'American Idol' judges Randy Jackson, left, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell returned for the series finale in 2016. Fox says it's \"too soon\" for a return, though ABC will give it one. (Photo: Matt Sayles, AP) \n \n This ... is American Idol, on a new network. \n \n The singing competition, which set ratings records over a storied 15-year run on Fox but was canceled last spring, is being resurrected on ABC. \n \n The Disney-owned network confirmed the news early Tuesday, providing no details about judges, a host, timing or the duration of the series, though it's been speculated that a shortened season will begin next spring on Sunday nights. The show's previous seasons, about 20 weeks each, stretched from mid-January to mid-May. \n \n TMZ first reported Idol producers FremantleMedia and 19 Entertainment's talks with ABC after earlier discussions with NBC ended. \n \n As for who might be back? \n \n TMZ says Ryan Seacrest, who joined the Disney family only last week as the new co-host of Live with Kelly!, \"seems interested\" in returning as host, though Seacrest Monday played coy on Live!, saying, \"I don't know if I can host it.\" \n \n If the show remains in Los Angeles, as expected, Seacrest would have to jet back and forth each week during live Idol episodes. But Live!'s previous co-host, Michael Strahan, did the same thing each week during NFL season, when he moonlighted as a host of Fox NFL Sunday in Los Angeles, though the weekend gig didn't pose as direct a conflict. \n \n Simon Cowell, the judge who vaulted the show to fame, is now executive producer and a judge on NBC's America's Got Talent. NBC is also the new network home of fellow judge Jennifer Lopez, who has a major deal to produce and star in a new reality-competition series, World of Dance (premiering May 30) in addition to her current detective drama Shades of Blue. \n \n Idol was the top-rated show for eight seasons of its run, peaking in its fifth with an average of more than 30 million viewers (and 36 million for its May performance finale). But by the end of its run, Idol drew only about one-third of that audience, even as the show's expenses \u2014 some judges were paid $15 million a season \u2014 skyrocketed. Fox announced a planned final season in 2015, and the show ended its run only last May, after NBC's The Voice had eclipsed it. \n \n While ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey, in a statement, called Idol \"a pop-culture staple that left the air too soon,\" former executive producer Nigel Lythgoe expressed skepticism about the speedy return, telling Variety, \"it feels a little too soon to bring it back.\" But ABC has been struggling on Sundays with dramas, ranks fourth among the major networks and with no NFL contract, can sorely use another reality hit. And all of the networks have struggled in recent attempts to launch new unscripted hits; NBC's Little Big Shots,which started strongly, already has faded in its second season. \n \n Although ABC found success adapting two other British reality hits, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and Dancing with the Stars, it has failed in several attempts to clone Idol. Among the notorious bombs were The One: Making a Music Star, a costly summer series that opened with 3 million viewers and was canceled after two weeks in 2006; and Rising Star,which aired in 2014 and featured contestants singing behind partitions. But Idol has a built-in (if faded) fan base, and the reboot will likely be heavily promoted during ABC's Oscar telecast, typically the highest-rated entertainment program each year. Except for that time Idol beat it. \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2pZOIk5 ||||| GIF Image via Fox/GIPHY. \n \n That strange rash on your elbow that miraculously went away but then resurfaces.

Not only were ratings lower than ever (as in, no one you knew was still watching or cared), the show\u2019s ability to build its contestants into actual stars had long faded. The last three winners of Idol: Trent Harmon, Nick Fradiani (??) and Caleb Johnson. \n \n Even more perplexing than the show\u2019s return is that Ryan Seacrest has not been ruled out of hosting, given that he\u2019s ALREADY the host of ANOTHER show that would seem to take up A LOT of his time: New Year\u2019s Rockin\u2019 Eve. \n \n \n \n Despite the logistical challenge, Idol producers are reportedly looking to relocate the show to New York City to perhaps accommodate Seacrest and avoid a tiring search for a host. On Monday\u2019s Live with Kelly & Ryan, Seacrest said, \u201cI had no idea it was being talked about to come here until late last week I heard a rumor in the news and made a phone call, and they said, \u2018Yeah, it may actually end up here.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, that\u2019s kind of good to know since I work here.\u2019\u201d Except, he added, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can host it.\u201d \n \n Advertisement \n \n A source told People, \u201cThere have been no formal discussions with Ryan about his involvement, but he may well be open to it\u2026 in the right capacity and if it fit in with his other commitments.\u201d Well, welcome back Idol.

    "document": "On July 26, Shoukhrat Mitalipov woke up to headlines about his research: \u201cFirst human embryos edited in US,\u201d said one; \u201cGenome of viable human embryos edited in controversial study,\u201d said another. Normally, this would be a cause for celebration for the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) professor. But in this case, all the media coverage did was stress him out\u2014his study wasn\u2019t supposed to be published until Aug. 2. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t know how it got leaked,\u201d Mitalipov said on July 28. \u201cIt\u2019s likely because of a combination of hot words: Crispr, gene-editing, and designer babies.\u201d \n \n He sounded annoyed, and justifiably so. The articles had rung alarm bells about \u201cdesigner babies\u201d engineered to have advantageous genetic traits, but his research was far from proving that a possibility. Although it did involve the use of human embryos\u2014which is a union of egg and sperm\u2014it also wasn\u2019t particularly controversial. In 2015, after a long debate, experts at the US National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine concluded that this sort of research on human embryos should be encouraged. And in fact, one prominent news story that called Mitalipov\u2019s study \u201ccontroversial\u201d actually contained testimonies from two bioethicists who supported the study (the headline has since been changed). \n \n Today (Aug. 2), Mitalipov\u2019s study was published in the journal Nature. It shows the first highly successful use of the gene-editing technique called Crispr to improve human health: his team was able correct a genetic mutation that causes a life-threatening cardiac disease. None of the embryos were allowed to come to term. But if Mitalipov has his way, future projects could eradicate a disease that affects millions\u2014one in 500 people carry the mutation\u2014and even kills unsuspecting, seemingly fit adults. \n \n Picking the target \n \n On Mar. 4, 1990, Loyola Marymount University basketball player Hank Gathers dunked the ball to put the Loyola Lions well ahead of the University of Portland Pilots. Immediately afterwards he collapsed and stopped breathing. There were 13 minutes left in the basketball game; he\u2019d given everything to the sport. The cause of death was later determined to be hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common inherited cardiac disease and the most common cause of death in young athletes. \n \n Mitalipov began working on the project three years ago. He knew he wanted to try to use Crispr to cure a genetic disease, but first he needed to pick which mutation in the human genome to target. He could have chosen from thousands, but Sanjeev Kaul, a cardiovascular specialist at OHSU, convinced Mitalipov to go after the HCM gene mutation. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s such a terrible disease to deal with it, and it\u2019s present in a large population,\u201d Mitalipov says. \u201cIn India, for instance, nearly one in ten people carry it.\u201d \n \n The most common cause of HCM is a genetic mutation in one of nine genes. Mitalipov\u2019s research shows that you can take a human embryo with one such mutation, where the human genome is missing four base pairs (or letters of DNA) and simply correct it. In theory, if you let that embryo grow, it would develop into a human without HCM. \n \n Substitutes won\u2019t do \n \n Next Mitalipov had to convince the OHSU review board to approve the use of human embryos. That part took about two years. \n \n Most research to understand what happens at the embryonic stage of human development is done on embryo-like cells, created by exposing adult stem cells to a special handful of chemicals. But though embryo-like cells have been a boon for research, they are not a perfect replacement for embryonic cells. Certain things, like DNA repair systems, can be quite different in embryos than they are in embryo-like cells. \n \n And DNA repair was key to Mitalipov\u2019s research. Crispr is the most precise gene-editing technique we have, but it doesn\u2019t actually \u201cedit\u201d genes. Instead, it seeks out the gene it has been programmed to target and then makes a snip. The next step almost always involves relying on the cell\u2019s own DNA repair system, which finds the cut and does its best to fix it. \n \n In most cells in the body, there are two repair systems. The system most often used by the body requires less effort, but it also does a sloppy job: sometimes inserting a letter of DNA where it doesn\u2019t belong and other times deleting a letter of DNA that should be there. The other repair system produces more accurate results, but the cells need to put in more effort to make it happen, so it\u2019s rarely used. However, past research hinted that human egg cells tend to use the second system. Mitalipov needed this especially strong DNA repair system to accomplish his Crispr-HCM edit. \n \n With the case made and approval secured, Mitalipov\u2019s team went into full gear. A group of collaborators recruited a man with the HCM mutation who would donate sperm, and a dozen healthy women who would donate eggs for the research. \n \n Beating China \n \n Three previous studies that used Crispr in human embryos\u2014all conducted in China\u2014produced poor results. The first, published in 2015, injected Crispr in 86 non-viable embryos (all discards from in-vitro fertilization treatment), in an effort to cure the inherited blood disorder \u03b2-thalassemia. It only worked in about 33% of the samples, and even then in those cases it was far from perfect: each had undesirable cuts in other locations on the genome (called \u201coff-target effects\u201d). \n \n Another attempt published in 2016 tried a different tack. Instead of removing a mutation, it sought to induce one that would provide resistance to HIV. Gene insertion was only successful in 25% of the 26 non-viable embryos, and many of those \u201csuccesses\u201d ended up with the wrong mutation. \n \n Earlier this year, the researchers made the case that the reason their 2016 study failed wasn\u2019t because Crispr wasn\u2019t doing its job. Instead, they suspected that the embryos used, because they were non-viable, were too abnormal to effectively test Crispr\u2019s precision. But in a new study using six viable human embryos, they were still able to fully correct the mutation in only one. In another two, they fixed the mutation but in only some of the cells of the embryo\u2014leading to a condition known as \u201cmosaicism.\u201d In these cases, if the embryo were to come to term, it would create a human whose body has some cells with the mutation and others without. The upshot would be that there\u2019s no guarantee the adult would be free of the disease. \n \n Mitalipov had a plan to avoid both off-target effects and mosaicism. Instead of injecting Crispr after the embryo had formed, he decided to make the snip during the process of fertilization. So while injecting sperm, he also injected Crispr. \n \n OHSU The first sign of successful in vitro fertilization, after co-injection of a gene-correcting enzyme and sperm from a donor with a genetic mutation known to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. \n \n The programmed Crispr system located the position in the sperm DNA where the man\u2019s genome was missing the four key base pairs and it made a simple cut there. The fertilization process began with the cut in place. However, at some point during the early stages of the development of the embryo\u2014and Mitalipov doesn\u2019t know exactly when\u2014the egg\u2019s DNA repair system kicked in. The new embryo contained one strand of DNA from the mother, which the team knew to be healthy and without the HCM mutation, and another strand from the father that included a snip at the location of the HCM mutation. \n \n When the egg\u2019s more accurate DNA repair system detects the cut in the paternal strand, it started fixing it, using the maternal strand as a model. And because the maternal strand was healthy, the repair system added the four missing base pairs to the paternal strand, and the HCM mutation in the embryo was corrected. (This method is only applicable to situations where one parent has the mutation; if both parents have the same mutation, this type of DNA repair system has no functional model to copy.) \n \n Mitalipov\u2019s team tested their technique on a total of 163 viable embryos, and the mutation was corrected successfully in nearly 50% of them. Better still, only one of those embryos showed mosaicism and none showed any off-target effects. \n \n Two independent experts Quartz contacted\u2014Dieter Egli of Columbia University and Maria Jasin of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center\u2014weren\u2019t sure Mitalipov\u2019s claims were water tight. Based on the information provided in the study, Egli couldn\u2019t confidently say for sure that the tests used to detect mosaicism caught all mosaics. In other words, it\u2019s possible that results appear to be more positive than they actually are. Jasin pointed out that more evidence was needed to back up the claim that it was the more accurate method of DNA repair that the embryo used. She acknowledged that working with human embryos has extra constraints because researchers need to justify the use of every extra embryo, but still felt there were some gaps in the study. \n \n The father of human genetic engineering \n \n If the results do stand up, they are orders of magnitude better than the three previous Chinese attempts\u2014both because of the rate of success and the number of viable embryos tested. But Mitalipov acknowledges that it\u2019s still not good enough. \u201cA 50% success rate is too low,\u201d he says. \n \n Reuters/Richard Clement Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health & Science University. \n \n His exacting standards have paid off in the past. Mitalipov\u2019s groundbreaking work in the late 2000s paved the way for \u201cthree-parent babies;\u201d last year, a technique he developed contributed to the birth of the first genetically engineered baby born with DNA from two females and one male. \n \n The technique cures mitochondrial disease, which is caused because of faulty mitochondria, the power packs in each human cell that converts sugar into a usable form of energy. Children born with mitochondrial disease either die young or live disabled lives. \n \n Most human genes are jammed into the cell\u2019s nucleus, but there\u2019s a tiny fraction (37 out of 20,000) present in mitochondria. These genes are only passed down from mother to child. Mitalipov developed the technique to replace a mother\u2019s faulty mitochondria with healthy ones from a female donor. Though the baby will mostly still be the genetic child of one man and one woman, he or she will have a small number of genes from another woman, technically a third \u201cparent.\u201d \n \n \u201cIn 2009, when I published my research on mitochondrial replacement, people laughed at me,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said \u2018You will never bring it to clinic.\u2019 Look where we are today.\u201d \n \n He first developed the technique in monkeys, and then progressed to human embryos\u2014reaching success rates of 99%. He has the same ambition for Crispr-edited human embryos. \n \n \u201cI have a very strong opinion on clinical applications. I didn\u2019t do this research to satisfy my curiosity,\u201d Mitalipov says. \u201cThis was done to develop the technology and bring it to clinics. It may take a decade, but we will be there.\u201d \n \n Slippery slope? \n \n Crispr-editing of human embryos is a much more complex endeavor than the three-parent baby technique. There is no guarantee, for instance, that the steps used by Mitalipov to fix the HCM mutation would work on other similar mutations or on more complex ones. However, if the technique is perfected, it will have a much greater impact on human health than anything the three-parent technique could ever offer. \n \n The complexity is also a safeguard against the use of the technique to, say, create babies with traits such as higher intelligence or greater strength. We don\u2019t yet understand the sheer number of genes involved in the creation of those traits, let alone what it would take to make such detailed edits to the human genome. In other words, even if you think it\u2019s an ethical hazard to the Crispr to provide advantageous mutations, there\u2019s no reason to worry right now; those \u201cdesigner babies\u201d are decades away. \n \n A more immediate threat is unregulated use. Genetic engineering of humans has already begun, and there is real danger in people with inadequate understanding of the risks starting to use Crispr to edit out inherited illnesses and bring the embryos to term. The baby is likely to suffer mosaicism, off-target effects, or other as-yet-undetected consequences, and we don\u2019t know what that could do to the person born with them. \n \n The first three-parent baby was born in Mexico, because at the time the country had no regulations on the use of the technique. Though the baby was reported to be healthy few months after birth, the risks of things going awry are much higher without the rigorous checks provided by clinical trials in a country with strong regulations. (The second three-parent birth was reported to have occurred in Ukraine.) \n \n OHSU Embryos after co-injection developing into blastocysts, which could someday be used in fertility clinics to help people trying to have children free of genetic disease. \n \n \u201cUnfortunately, that\u2019s a risk,\u201d admits Paula Amato, a gynecologist who collaborates with Mitalipov at the OHSU. \u201cObviously, we would prefer clinical applications occur in a regulated environment. But it\u2019s not something we can control.\u201d In the US, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) forbids the use of human embryos in clinical trials. \u201cSo it\u2019s not surprising to me that people would attempt to circumvent such restrictions,\u201d Amato says. \n \n In the US, only pre-clinical research involving human embryos is allowed and even for that government funds aren\u2019t available. Mitalipov\u2019s work was supported mostly by OHSU\u2019s institutional funds and the rest through charitable foundations. His collaborators in South Korea, where human embryo research is strictly forbidden, had to get lawyers and were only able to handle DNA extracts from the test embryos, and not the embryos themselves. \n \n There are some places that offer regulated environments without stifling experimentation and clinical use. Amato points to the UK, the first country to offer licenses to create three-parent babies, if those applying could make the case for it. The country spent years debating the topic among experts and holding public consultations before it reached that stage. \n \n Ultimately, if society would like to see the use of Crispr or other techniques to rid humanity of devastating diseases, countries will need to undertake a process similar to what the UK went through. Without hearing the voice of the public and putting the right regulations in place, the fear of \u201cdesigner babies\u201d could not only lead to dangerous experimentation in unregulated environments, but also quash the true potential of this powerful tool. ||||| \n \n \n \n TEXAS TOWNSHIP, Mich. (WOOD) \u2014 A 4-month-old from the Kalamazoo area is one of only a few in the world with a rare condition similar to the one that recently took the life of British baby Charlie Gard. \n \n Russell Cruzan III\u2019s parents are fighting to find him treatment that could save his life. Even though doctors say Russell\u2019s chances of survival are slim, his parents are hoping he\u2019ll defy the odds. \n \n Held by his mother in his Texas Township home Monday, Russell\u2019s breathing was labored. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to be told that your child\u2019s chances of even making it to 2 are like 50 percent,\u201d his mother, Michelle Budnick-Nap, said tearfully. \n \n She and Russell\u2019s father noticed something was wrong in early June. \n \n \u201c(We) kept asking the nurses why. Why is he not eating? Why isn\u2019t he thriving?\u201d Budnik-Nap recalled. \n \n There were no answers. And Russell kept getting worse. Dehydrated and lethargic with a low body temperature, he was admitted to Bronson Children\u2019s Hospital for a week. \n \n Doctors treated the symptoms, but Russell\u2019s parents say they weren\u2019t ever given a reason why their child was sick. \n \n Two days after Russell was released, his parents rushed him back to the hospital when he started having severe respiratory problems and then developed pneumonia. Russell was in the hospital for a month. \n \n Still, no answers. \n \n Until a test on his kidneys came back. \n \n \u201cWhen those labs came back the doctor called and she was like, \u2018You need to bring him into the hospital right now. His labs are looking kind of crazy. We need to find out what\u2019s going on,'\u201d Budnik-Nap said. \n \n The diagnosis was mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome 13, which can cause a loss of muscle mobility and strength, decreased kidney function and an inability to swallow. \n \n Charlie Gard also had mitochondrial depletion syndrome. \n \n The baby in the United Kingdom was at the center of a legal battle over whether his parents should be allowed to bring him to the United States for experimental treatment. Doctors objected, saying it wouldn\u2019t help and could in fact hurt Charlie. Eventually, his parents ended their fight when it became clear that the treatment could no longer save their son. \n \n Charlie died last week. He would have turned 1 this week. \n \n After Russell\u2019s diagnosis, doctors told his parents the the odds were against him. \n \n \u201c\u2018We know the seriousness of this diagnosis. We know what the prognosis is. Do you want to keep fighting or do you want to give up and let nature take its course?'\u201d Burdik-Nap said she was told. \u201cWhich is a really, really hard thing to hear. But I always tell them, \u2018Bo, we want to do everything we can. We want to fight.'\u201d \n \n That\u2019s why she and Russell\u2019s father are working to get to Boston. \n \n \u201cIf anything if they can\u2019t save him or whatever \u2014 maybe he can be used to save kids in the future,\u201d Russell Cruzan II said. \n \n They say a doctor at Boston Children\u2019s Hospital, who is one of the top mitochondrial physicians in the country, has agreed to treat Russell if a doctor at Bronson can get the insurance company will authorize it. If Russell goes to Boston, he would get a treatment aimed at helping his healthy mitochondria replicate. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that we\u2019ve come to terms with it. We love him more than anything in the world,\u201d Budnik-Nap said. \n \n They may be able to get treatment for their son, but insurance isn\u2019t covering the costs.

It causes debilitating physical, developmental, and cognitive disabilities with symptoms including poor growth; loss of muscle coordination; muscle weakness and pain; seizures; vision and/or hearing loss; gastrointestinal issues; learning disabilities; and organ failure. It is estimated that 1 in 4,000 people has Mito. It\u2019s progressive and there is no cure. \n \n What are Mitochondria? \n \n Mitochondria are tiny organelles found in almost every cell in the body. \n \n They are known as the \"powerhouse of the cell.\" \n \n They are responsible for creating more than 90 percent of cellular energy. \n \n They are necessary in the body to sustain life and support growth. \n \n They are composed of tiny packages of enzymes that turn nutrients into cellular energy. \n \n Mitochondrial failure causes cell injury that leads to cell death. When multiple organ cells die there is organ failure. \n \n Watch the 5-minute video, \"How energy is made\" \n \n back to top \n \n What is Mitochondrial Disease? \n \n Mitochondrial disease is a chronic, genetic disorder that occurs when the mitochondria of the cell fail to produce enough energy for cell or organ function. \n \n The incidence is about 1:4000 individuals in the US. This is similar to the incidence of cystic fibrosis of caucasian births in the U.S. \n \n There are many forms of mitochondrial disease. \n \n Mitochondrial disease is inherited in a number of ways. \n \n Mitochondrial disease presents vary differently from individual to individual. \n \n There may be one individual in a family or many individuals affected over a number of generations. \n \n back to top \n \n What are the Symptoms of Mitochondrial Disease? \n \n The severity of mitochondrial disease symptoms is different from person to person. The most common symptoms are: \n \n Poor growth \n \n Loss of muscle coordination, muscle weakness \n \n Neurological problems, seizures \n \n Autism, autistic spectrum, autistic-like features \n \n Visual and/or hearing problems \n \n Developmental delays, learning disabilities \n \n Heart, liver or kidney disease \n \n Gastrointestinal disorders, severe constipation \n \n Diabetes \n \n Increased risk of infection \n \n Thyroid and/or adrenal dysfunction \n \n Autonomic dysfunction \n \n Neuropsychological changes characterized by confusion, disorientation, and memory loss. \n \n Detailed information about symptoms can be found in the Clinician's Guide to Mitochondrial Disease \n \n back to top \n \n How common are mitochondrial diseases? \n \n Infants, children, and adults may develop mitochondrial disorders. Experts in mitochondrial medicine agree there is a spectrum of the disease, ranging from mild to severe. \n \n In adults, many diseases of aging have been found to have defects of mitochondrial function; these include, but are not limited to, Type 2 diabetes, Parkinson's disease, atherosclerotic heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer. In addition, many medicines can injure the mitochondria. \n \n back to top \n \n What causes mitochondrial disease? \n \n For many patients, mitochondrial disease is an inherited genetic condition. An uncertain percentage of patients acquire symptoms due to other factors, including mitochondrial toxins. \n \n It is important to determine which type of mitochondrial disease inheritance is present in order to predict the risk of recurrence for future children. The types of mitochondrial disease inheritance include: \n \n DNA (DNA contained in the nucleus of the cell) inheritance. Also called autosomal inheritance. If this gene trait is recessive (one gene from each parent), often no other family members appear to be affected. There is a 25 percent chance of the trait occurring in other siblings. If this gene trait is dominant (a gene from either parent), the disease often occurs in other family members. There is a 50 percent chance of the trait occurring in other siblings. \n \n \n \n MtDNA (DNA contained in the mitochondria) inheritance. \n \n There is a 100 percent chance of the trait occurring in other siblings, since all mitochondria are inherited from the mother, although symptoms might be either more or less severe. \n \n Combination of mtDNA and nDNA defects: \n \n Relationship between nDNA and mtDNA and their correlation in mitochondrial formation is unknown. \n \n Read more about genetics and the inheritance of mitochondrial disease. \n \n back to top \n \n Random occurrences \n \n Diseases specifically from deletions of large parts of the mitochondrial DNA molecule are usually sporadic without affecting other family member. \n \n Medicines or other toxic substances can trigger mitochondrial disease. \n \n back to top \n \n How is Mitochondrial Disease Diagnosed? \n \n There is no reliable and consistent means of diagnosis. \n \n Diagnosis can be made by one of the few physicians who specialize in mitochondrial disease. \n \n Diagnosis can be made by blood DNA testing and/or muscle biopsy but neither of these tests is completely reliable. \n \n Read about the vitamins and supplements used to treat Mito \n \n How is Mitochondrial Disease Treated? \n \n The goal is to improve symptoms and slow progression of the disease. \n \n Use vitamin therapy \n \n Conserve energy \n \n Pace activities \n \n Maintain an ambient environmental temperature \n \n Avoid exposure to illness \n \n Ensure adequate nutrition and hydration \n \n back to top \n \n Misdiagnosis \n \n Lack of understanding of the disease and misinterpretation of symptoms can lead to misdiagnosis. \n \n Further progression of symptoms can occur if the symptoms are missed and opportunities for treatment and support are not recognized. \n \n back to top \n \n What are the Challenges of Living with Mitochondrial Disease? \n \n Affects multiple organs, affects multiple family members, affects multiple generations. \n \n Lack of awareness and understanding of the disease. \n \n Families are continuously forced to expend their very limited energy to explain their disease, advocate for themselves and fight for services. \n \n Mitochondrial disease is often an \"invisible disease.\" Good day - Patients look fine and healthy. They have more energy and appear rested. Bad day - - Patients appear tired to significantly ill. They are obviously fatigued and/or have significant illness. Repeated \"bad days\"often lead to decompensation and patients have difficulty returning to baseline. \n \n Mitochondrial disease is unpredictable. Day to day, hour to hour patients can develop symptoms and their stability can be threatened. \n \n Difficulties establishing a diagnosis interfere with a patient's ability to obtain adequate recognition, medical care, insurance coverage, healthcare supports, and disability services. \n \n Lack of understanding of the disease and misinterpretation of symptoms can lead to misdiagnosis.

In it, he is credited with inventing what is now known as the \"three-parent baby\" system, in which two parents share the responsibility for raising their children. In the report, he talks about how he came up with the idea for the system, which he describes as \"one of the most fundamental shifts in our understanding of how genes and cells interact.\" He explains that he and his team were inspired to create the system when they were approached by a professor from the University of California, Davis, who suggested it might be useful in the fight against cancer. \"I said, \u2018I think I can do that,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been thinking about for a long time.\u201d He explains how he decided on the name \"Crispr\" because that was the name of the book he was working on at OHSU at the time, and the name came from the book of the same name that had been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. He says he was inspired to write the book after hearing the professor talk about it, and he decided to use it as a starting point for his own research. As for why he chose to use the term \"crispr,\" he explains that it's a reference to the term for a gene-editing technique that has been around since the 1960s, when it was first introduced in the journal Biology Letters. As the name suggests, it refers to the genetic modification that takes place when two or more copies of a particular gene are inserted into the same person's body.

Penn wrote a colorful story for Rolling Stone about the encounter. \n \n \n \n What drew Coronel's wrath \u2014 and that of her husband, she believes \u2014 is a video posted with the article in which Guzman, sitting in front of a fence in a country setting, acknowledges he has worked in the drug trade since he was 15 \u2014 drawn to it because of the poverty in the rural mountains. \n \n \n \n Coronel said that publishing the video, whose rights were granted not by Penn but by Del Castillo's company, was a \"betrayal.\" Her husband, she said, believed that the footage would be used only as background information for a text article. \n \n \n \n Del Castillo's lawyer, Los Angeles attorney Harland Braun, said the drug lord clearly understood that the actress was there to talk about a movie \u2014 a project he said she is still pursuing. \"He's admitting [in the video] to being a drug trafficker. And the point that he's in the drug business, that embarrasses him? The whole point of the movie is that he's in the drug business. What she's saying doesn't make any sense.\" \n \n \n \n Then there was the affectionate exchange of messages between her husband and Del Castillo, leaked to the Mexican publication Milenio after his latest arrest. \"You are so beautiful, my friend, in every way,\" Guzman told the actress in one of them. \"I will take care of you more than I do my own eyes.\" \n \n \n \n Coronel said she did not find the exchanges troubling. \"I think it was the first time they met.

When they got disoriented, they called 911 from their cellphones and were able to talk rescuers toward them. \n \n They were on a 5-mile trail shaped like a lollipop headed to an area called High Rock, which is known for its breathtaking views, according to Shad Baker, a local resident who created many of the public trails used in the area and helped guide rescuers via cell phone. \n \n \"Rescuing 37 people is a monumental undertaking,\" Baker said. \"So the fact that they got them out is really good.\" \n \n The trail, lined with hemlock trees and rhododendron bushes, takes hikers immediately into the deep woods. A sign at the trail head warns hikers to stay on the trail. A visitor log at the entrance to the trail was signed \"La Salle University\" for March 8. \n \n Baker said the hikers didn't arrive at High Rock until 5 p.m., it began to get dark, and much of the trail was covered by trees, branches and snow. He said the group would have had to cross three streams to reach the destination, and rescuers said by the time they arrived, many of the hikers said their feet were numb. \n \n \"I think once they got up there, there's 37 footprints going every which direction. ... I think they couldn't figure out which way they came from,\" Baker said. \n \n Baker said to make things more confusing, the trail that would have taken them down the mountain actually goes uphill before it goes downhill. \n \n \"It's counterintuitive,\" he said. \n \n He said the group was not dressed for the weather, with most of them wearing just sneakers, jeans and light jackets as temperatures began dropping into the 20s. \n \n Fugate said only a few of the students had flashlights. \n \n The group had to be walked down the mountain using an alternate route that had fewer obstacles but took more time, Baker said. \n \n National Weather Service meteorologist Ed Ray said temperatures in the Pine Mountain area dipped into the low 20s overnight. He said the high Thursday reached only into the mid-20s. \n \n Caroulis said the group was expected to return to Pennsylvania on Saturday as scheduled. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Rebecca Yonker and Janet Cappiello contributed to this report. ||||| One hiker remained hospitalized Friday morning after 37 Pennsylvania college students and three staff members were rescued Thursday night from Pine Mountain in Letcher County, police said. \n \n The hikers from La Salle University in Philadelphia called for help about 7 p.m. Thursday and were found by 11 p.m., Kentucky State Police trooper Tony Watts said. \n \n The group, which was hiking near Bad Branch Falls at a place called High Rock, stayed together near a campfire and stayed in contact with police and rescue workers by cellphone after that first call, Watts said. \n \n The hikers had to leave the mountain by foot, and that took until 3:45 a.m. Friday, Letcher County Fire and Rescue Ambulance Service Director Gary Rogers said. \n \n All 40 of the hikers were taken to Whitesburg Appalachian Regional Hospital, where one remained Friday, hospital spokeswoman Hollie Phillips said. \n \n The remaining hiker is in stable condition and is expected to be released Saturday, said Dena Sparkman, Community CEO for Whitesburg ARH. \n \n The students were treated for possible hypothermia, dehydration and exhaustion, Sparkman said. One hiker had strained knees, she said. \n \n In addition to medical treatment, she said, hospital staff provided the cold, wet students with chicken noodle soup, dry hospital scrubs and pajama pants. \n \n \"The other thing was loaning them cellphones so that they could call their parents. That was an emotional time,\" Sparkman said. \n \n LaSalle spokesman Jon Caroulis said the person who was hospitalized Friday was there for observation because of a pre-existing condition. Caroulis declined to elaborate. The group was expected to return to Philadelphia on Saturday. \n \n Caroulis said the group, including three non-faculty staff members, was on an alternative spring break trip to Eastern Kentucky that the university has offered for several years. \n \n The students had stayed in Harlan County, where they were volunteering for a non-profit organization, Caroulis said. \n \n The students had hiked during previous trips, but this time, they took the wrong path down the mountain, he said. \n \n Blake Enlow, executive director of a Harlan-based group called Christian Outreach with Appalachian People, said the college group was helping to remodel a home and build another. \n \n \"Thankfully, they are all OK, just worn out,\" Enlow said. \n \n Valarie Honeycutt Spears: (859) 231-3409.

Other cities are equipped with walkable streets and reliable mass transit options, making car ownership less necessary. \n \n We considered these and other factors to find the worst cities to own a car.

To understand where we got our data and how we put it together to create our final ranking, see the data and methodology section below. \n \n Key Findings \n \n Cities on the coasts \u2013 The entire top 10 is comprised of cities on or close to the coasts. This makes sense as many of the largest cities in the country are located on the coasts. Plus, on the East Coast in particular, these cities tend to be older which means they were not built to handle car traffic. \n \n \u2013 The entire top 10 is comprised of cities on or close to the coasts.

However, in some cities getting around by car is just about the only option you have if you want to leave your house. Thus some cities with really bad traffic like Los Angeles or Long Beach didn\u2019t quite crack the top 10. \n \n 1. Newark, New Jersey \n \n Brick City tops our ranking of the worst cities to own a car. What\u2019s tough about being a car owner in Newark is the traffic. It\u2019s part of the New York City metro area which has 19 million people, 5 million of whom drive to work. Newark is stuck right in the middle of this bumper-to-bumper traffic. Plus, if you\u2019re a car owner in Newark, the risk of having your car stolen is much higher than it is in other cities. Newark ranks eighth in the country for motor vehicle thefts per 1,000 residents. \n \n Related Article: The States With the Worst Drivers \n \n 2. San Francisco, California \n \n The City in the Bay grabs the second spot for worst places to own a car. Being stuck in traffic costs the average commuter in San Francisco $1,600 per year. That cost includes both the value of the time spent in traffic and the cost of gas. SF is also one of the 10 worst cities for motor vehicle thefts per resident, another reason to forgo car ownership. \n \n 3. Washington, D.C. \n \n The District and the surrounding metro area sees some of the worst traffic in the country. The average D.C. commuter spends 82 hours per year in traffic. Depending on how you slice it, that\u2019s either two working weeks or almost three-and-a-half days of doing nothing but shaking your fist at your fellow drivers. That traffic is equal to an annual cost of $1,834 per commuter. \n \n 4. Oakland, California \n \n One argument against car ownership in Oakland is the crime. There were almost 6,400 motor vehicle thefts in the city of Oakland or 15 auto thefts per 1,000 residents. That\u2019s the highest rate in the country. The average Oakland driver can also expect to spend 78 hours per year in traffic. On the plus side, if something goes wrong with your wheels in Oakland, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to get it fixed. There are more than six repair shops per 10,000 drivers in Oakland \u2013 the highest rate in the top 10. \n \n 5. Arlington, Virginia \n \n As previously mentioned, the Washington, D.C. metro area has the worst traffic in the country. Unfortunately for the residents of Arlington, they are a part of that metro area. They face the same brutal 82 hours per year spent in traffic, on average. It costs Arlington residents $1,834 per year, on average, waiting in that traffic. For residents of Arlington, a car is more of a necessity than it is for people living in D.C., which is why it ranks lower in our study. \n \n 6. Portland, Oregon \n \n Of all the cities in our top 10, Portland is the least onerous for the driving commuter. Commuters driving around the Portland metro area can be thankful that, on average, they spent only 52 hours per year in traffic. That traffic still costs each driver about $1,200. However, drivers in Portland looking for a parking garage may be out of luck. Portland has the second-lowest number of parking garages per driver in our study, and if you are looking to get your car fixed, Portland ranks in the bottom 13 for repair shops per capita. \n \n 7. Anaheim, California \n \n Anaheim commuters are well-acquainted with traffic. Anaheim (and the rest of the Los Angeles metro area) ranks third in average hours per year spent in traffic, first for commuter stress index and fifth for annual cost of idling in traffic. Anaheim only ranks seventh because Walkability.com gives the city a 46 out of 100 for non-driving options. That\u2019s the lowest score in our top 10 meaning, while owning a car here is a pain, not owning one makes getting around a true struggle. \n \n 8. New York, New York \n \n New York is the rare American city where public transportation is usually your best bet for getting from point A to point B. All that accessibility makes car ownership unnecessary here. For New Yorkers who do drive, the traffic is not pleasant. New York drivers spend $1,700 per year, on average, waiting in traffic. That\u2019s the third-highest cost in our study. \n \n Not sure if you\u2019re ready to buy in NYC? Check out our rent vs. buy calculator. \n \n 9. Seattle, Washington \n \n Seattle has pretty bad traffic. Commuters here probably aren\u2019t surprised to hear the average driver spends 63 hours per year in traffic. And coupled with the traffic is the high number of motor vehicle thefts. Seattle has the fourth-highest rate of motor vehicle thefts per 1,000 residents in the country. \n \n 10. Boston, Massachusetts \n \n Boston ranked well in our study on the most livable cities in the U.S. partially based on how easy it is to get around without a car. After New York and San Francisco, Boston is the most walkable city in the country, making the cost of having a car one expense which Bostonians can possibly go without. Although occasionally maligned, the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority is a great option for commuters who want to avoid the 64 hours per year Boston drivers spend in traffic. \n \n Data and Methodology \n \n In order to rank the worst cities to own a car, we looked at data on the 100 largest cities in the country.

It\u2019ll be available through Apple, Verizon, AT&T and Apple\u2019s other authorized resellers in 16- and 32-gigabyte versions for $199 and $299, respectively, with a two-year wireless contract. \n \n More on TIME.com: \n \n Best Buy Shows White iPhone Launch Date as April 27 \n \n White iPhone Said to Make Appearance by the End of April \n \n Almost Very Nearly Official: White iPhone Coming This Spring ||||| Apple aims to \u2013 finally \u2013 set the record straight about the gathering and use of location information by iOS devices. The entire Q&A can be found below. \n \n Apple starts off by stating that it has never tracked, and will never track the location of a customer\u2019s iPhone. The company goes on to say it\u2019s partly to blame for any \u2018confusion\u2019 about it, though, because users haven\u2019t been \u2018educated\u2019 to fully understand the technical issues with providing mobile users with fast and accurate location information. \n \n That said, the company did identify several \u2018bugs\u2019 which it says it will fix shortly. \n \n As we posited earlier, Apple says it\u2019s merely maintaining a crowd-sourced database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers around your current location that is generated by tens of millions of iPhones sending geo-tagged locations, both anonymously and encrypted. \n \n According to the Cupertino company, the location data that researchers spotted on the iPhone is not the past or present location of the iPhone, but rather the locations of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers surrounding the iPhone\u2019s location, which it adds can be more than one hundred miles away from the device in question. \n \n Apple says it simply can not identify the source of this data (i.e. your location). \n \n Nevertheless, the company says it will release a free iOS software update sometime in the next few weeks that reduces the size of the Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower database cached on the iPhone, start encrypting and refrain from backing up this cache and delete it entirely when Location Services is turned off by the user. \n \n Apple admits that this storing the cache for such a long time was a bug that will be fixed, ultimately recognizing that this was a valid source for concern. Another bug resulted in the iPhone continually updating its Wi-Fi and cell tower data from Apple\u2019s crowd-sourced database even after the user turned off Location Services on his phone. \n \n Earlier this week, a class action suit was filed, accusing Apple of invasion of privacy and computer fraud and of \u201csecretly recording movements of iPhone and iPad users.\u201d \n \n French, German, Italian and South Korean regulators had also started investigating the alleged location collection feature on Apple devices following publication of the researchers report. \n \n Does Apple\u2019s response sound credible to you? \n \n Apple Q&A on Location Data:",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Apple finally responded to the accusations that it was tracking iPhone users\u2019 locations today, saying it \u201chas never done so and has no plans to ever do so.\u201d In a statement, which you can read on TechCrunch, the company explained that it was actually keeping a log not of the phone\u2019s location, but of the location of WiFi hotspots and cell towers, \u201csome of which may be located more than one hundred miles away from your iPhone.\u201d The data is used to more quickly triangulate users\u2019 position when they use location-based services, and is sent to Apple anonymously. But the company did admit to some \u201cbugs\u201d in the software\u2014like that it keeps collecting data even after you\u2019ve turned Location Services off, and that it stored years of data, instead of the week's worth it needs\u2014and promised an iOS update to fix them. And, just to add some positive news to the cycle, it also announced that the rumored white iPhone will be available tomorrow, Time reports.",

    "document": "If you\u2019re serious about crafting, then you may have fantasized about ditching the 9-5, picking up the glue gun, and opening an eponymous Etsy shop. \n \n Well, Alicia Shaffer from Three Bird Nest, is living that dream. \n \n Shaffer is one of the most successful sellers on the online craft site, with more than, gulp, an estimated $65,000 a month in sales. But she tells Yahoo DIY that it didn\u2019t all happen, overnight, though. \n \n \n \n \n \n (Alicia Shaffer and family. All images courtesy Three Bird Nest) \n \n Etsy may seem like a quaint little destination for vintage pendants and handmade birthday cards, but with 30 million registered users, one million sellers and over one billion in total annual transactions, this is not your neighborhood craft fair. This is big e-commerce. \n \n \n \n \n \n girls posing with boquets More \n \n Where most shops would love to sell 300 items a day, Three Bird Nest is selling over 3,000. (If those numbers don\u2019t make you wanting to quit your day job, then you must really love what you do.) \n \n Three Bird Nest has its own distinctive sensibility, but it\u2019s not breaking the mold with exclusive, rarefied creations. Items similar to her lovely handmade, knitted scarves, wraps, headbands, beanies, boot socks and calf cozies (adorably irresistible) can be found elsewhere. So why is Shaffer cleaning up when others are coasting? \n \n \n \n \n \n Alicia wearing a homemade purple headband More \n \n One thing that stands out is Shaffer\u2019s passion for her work. \u201cI love textiles, fabric, fashion, designs, and seeing how different colors and fabrics pair together,\u201d she says on her site. When the seller\u2019s passion comes through, the shopper connects with craftsperson. \n \n But Shaffer also loves the business side. She happily absorbs the pressures that come from running her own mini empire. The creative process, from concepting, to production, to getting it in front of people to delivery is a high for her. To have a successful business on Etsy (or anywhere), she advises: you need to eat, sleep and breathe your brand. \n \n Shaffer also designs for a wide range of women, which broadens her potential customer base. \u201cShe\u2019s a mom, a student, a daughter, a bride, a woman going on a first date,\u201d she says. \n \n \n \n \n \n bracelets closeup More \n \n Read More ||||| Form S-1 \n \n As filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 4, 2015. \n \n Registration No. 333- \n \n UNITED STATES \n \n SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION \n \n Washington, D.C. 20549 \n \n FORM S-1 \n \n REGISTRATION STATEMENT \n \n UNDER \n \n THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n (Exact Name of Registrant as Specified in its Charter) \n \n Delaware 5961 20-4898921 (State or Other Jurisdiction of Incorporation or Organization) (Primary Standard Industrial Classification Code Number) (I.R.S.

We are building a human, authentic and community-centric global and local marketplace. We are committed to using the power of business to create a better world through our platform, our members, our employees and the communities we serve. These guiding principles are core to our mission: \u0095 Make it easy to find and buy unique goods from real people every day, on any platform, online and offline, anywhere in the world. \u0095 Help creative entrepreneurs start, responsibly scale and enjoy their businesses with Etsy. \u0095 Communicate the power of human connection whenever anyone experiences Etsy. Overview We operate a marketplace where people around the world connect, both online and offline, to make, sell and buy unique goods. Handmade goods are the foundation of our marketplace. Whether crafted by an Etsy seller herself, with the assistance of her team or with an outside manufacturer in small batches, handmade goods spring from the imagination and creativity of an Etsy seller and embody authorship, responsibility and transparency. We believe we are creating a new economy, which we call the Etsy Economy, where creative entrepreneurs find meaningful work and both global and local markets for their goods, and where thoughtful consumers discover and buy unique goods and build relationships with the people who sell them. Etsy was founded in June 2005 in Brooklyn, New York as a marketplace for handmade goods and craft supplies. From those beginnings, we have built an innovative, technology-based platform that, as of \n \n 1 \n \n December 31, 2014, connected 54.0 million members, including 1.4 million active sellers and 19.8 million active buyers, in nearly every country in the world. In 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion, of which 36.1% came from purchases made on mobile devices and 30.9% came from an Etsy seller or an Etsy buyer outside of the United States. Our community is the heart and soul of Etsy. Our community is made up of creative entrepreneurs who sell on our platform, thoughtful consumers looking to buy unique goods in our marketplace, responsible manufacturers who help Etsy sellers grow their businesses and Etsy employees who maintain our platform and nurture our ecosystem. Our business model is based on shared success: we make money when Etsy sellers make money. Our revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services we provide Etsy sellers to help them create and grow their businesses. Marketplace revenue includes the fee an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and the listing fee an Etsy seller pays for each item she lists. Seller Services revenue includes fees an Etsy seller pays for services such as prominent placement in search results via Promoted Listings, payment processing via Direct Checkout and purchases of shipping labels through our platform via Shipping Labels. Other revenue includes the fees we receive from a third-party payment processor. In 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion, up 43.3% over 2013. In 2014, we generated revenue of $195.6 million, up 56.4% over 2013. In 2014, we generated a net loss of $15.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $23.1 million compared to a net loss of $0.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $16.9 million in 2013. See \u0093Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u0097Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u0094 for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. Our Values We are a mindful, transparent and humane business. We believe that business interests and social and environmental responsibility are interwoven and aligned and that the power of business should be used to strengthen communities and empower people. We plan and build for the long term. We want to build a company that lasts, and we plan to measure our success in years and decades. Etsy sellers in particular depend on us and on our platform to grow their businesses, so we will strive to make decisions that are best for the long-term health of our ecosystem. We value craftsmanship in all we make. Craftsmanship is the marriage of skill and passion. We believe every job at our company should demonstrate our commitment to craft. We are an engineering-driven company, and we think of our code as craft: we are makers of the products and services that our members use, and we approach the work we do with the same care and inspiration as do Etsy sellers. \n \n 2 \n \n We believe fun should be part of everything we do. Our mission includes fostering a world in which personal fulfillment is a key element of success. We believe that this way of working is connected and joyful. We strive to do excellent work and bring a sense of humor and playfulness to it. We keep it real, always. We have the courage and the will to do business in ways that are unconventional and impactful. We strive to stay genuine, maintaining integrity, humility and sincerity in everything we do. When we feel that we are not being true to our values or our mission, we are not afraid to stop and change course. Our Opportunity We operate at the center of several converging macroeconomic trends in online and mobile commerce, employment, consumption and manufacturing. We believe that in combination these trends will benefit millions of people in our ecosystem around the world: Etsy sellers engaging in their creative passion, working for themselves and defining success on their own terms; Etsy buyers accessing a diverse, global marketplace of goods that have historically been found in highly fragmented markets; and, increasingly, responsible manufacturers using modern tools to craft goods in partnership with Etsy sellers. Trends in Online and Mobile Commerce. Etsy sellers offer goods in dozens of online retail categories, including jewelry, stationery, clothing, home goods, craft supplies and vintage items. Euromonitor, a consumer market research company, estimated that the global online retail market was $695 billion in 2013, up from $280 billion in 2008, representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 19.9%. This growth is expected to continue, with the global online retail market becoming a significantly larger portion of the total retail market, reaching $1.5 trillion by 2018, implying a 16.6% CAGR from 2013. Mobile commerce is also increasingly important in online retail. comScore estimated that since the first quarter of 2013, consumers visiting online commerce sites spent more than half of their browsing time on mobile devices; however, online commerce spending via mobile devices represented only 11% of total online commerce dollars in the third quarter of 2014. Trends in Employment. Whether motivated by economic necessity or personal preference, a growing number of people are turning to self-employment for their livelihoods. In a 2012 survey of middle-class households in the United States by the Pew Research Center, 85% said that it was more difficult to maintain their living standards today than it was ten years ago. A study commissioned in July 2014 by the Freelancers Union and Elance-oDesk estimated that 53 million Americans are working as freelancers. Women are also contributing to the trend towards self-employment. World Bank research shows that, in certain developing nations, over half of the women in the labor force are self-employed. We believe that many of these people have creative skills that could provide a foundation for entrepreneurship, but that they often have little or no experience running their own businesses, and they typically lack the marketing resources, the technological expertise and the manufacturing and logistics capabilities to turn their creativity into a business. \n \n 3 \n \n Trends in Consumption. Most large retailers today follow the same formula, emphasizing efficiency and scale and pressuring their suppliers to reduce their costs in order to serve mass-produced goods at the lowest-possible prices. We believe, however, that many consumers want to purchase goods that are unique and that reflect their personality and style, not simply mass-produced, generic goods. Some consumers want their purchases to reflect their values; they want to support retailers and suppliers that have responsible and sustainable policies toward their employees, their communities and the environment. Finding these goods can be difficult, as markets for such goods have historically been highly fragmented across boutiques, consignment stores and other venues and marketplaces. Trends in Manufacturing. Because of advances in manufacturing technologies, individuals and small businesses now have the ability to manufacture goods in their homes and studios using tools such as computer-assisted design, 3D printers, computer-controlled routers and other machines at a fraction of the historical cost. We believe the decrease in the size and the cost of these tools will make it easier for creative entrepreneurs to start new businesses. We also believe that small-batch manufacturers will be able to use these new technologies to provide high-quality manufacturing services so that creative entrepreneurs can scale their own businesses. Our Strengths Our platform connects millions of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers globally, making it one of the largest online marketplaces in the world. We have achieved our scale because of the following key strengths: \u0095 Our Authentic, Trusted Marketplace. We have built an authentic, trusted marketplace that embodies our values-based culture, emphasizing respect, direct communication and fun. We have developed a reputation for authenticity as a result of Etsy sellers\u0092 unique offerings and their adherence to our policies for handmade goods. We establish trust in our marketplace by emphasizing the person behind every transaction. We deepen connections among our members, making a personal relationship central to the member experience. The authenticity of our marketplace and the connections among people in our community are the cornerstones of our business. \u0095 Our Passionate, Engaged and Loyal Members. Our members are passionate, engaged and loyal\u0097not only to us, but to each other\u0097building a strong community. \u0095 Our Innovative Technology. Our widely-respected engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to smoothly transact across borders, languages and devices. \u0095 Our Scaled, Global-Local Marketplace. Our marketplace is global-local, meaning that we focus on building local Etsy communities around the world. Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers in these local \n \n 4 \n \n communities, in turn, have global reach and access through our platform. We believe our global-local marketplace creates strong competitive advantages outside the United States because our success is not dependent on scale in any given country. \u0095 Our Seller-Aligned Business Model. Etsy sellers are drawn to our platform because we empower them to succeed, and as Etsy sellers succeed, so do we. Our seller-aligned business model creates network effects. The more we invest in our platform, the more we enable Etsy sellers to pursue their craft and grow their businesses and the easier we make it for Etsy buyers to find unique goods. We call this Etsy\u0092s Empowerment Loop. Our Strategy: The Path Ahead We plan to continue connecting creative entrepreneurs, thoughtful consumers and responsible manufacturers and expanding the impact of our platform through the following key strategies: \u0095 Make Etsy an Everyday Experience. We emphasize relationships, connecting creative entrepreneurs to thoughtful consumers around the world, and we continually strive to make those connections a daily habit for our members. The everyday experience starts with mobile. \u0095 Build Local Marketplaces, Globally. Our vision is global and local. We plan to invest in local marketing and content and local payment and shipping solutions in countries around the world. We believe our locally-focused work will broaden the reach of our global platform. \u0095 Offer High-impact Seller Services. Seller Services help an Etsy seller spend more time on the pleasures of her craft and less time on the administrative aspects of her business. We intend to enhance existing Seller Services, extend their geographic reach and introduce new ones. \u0095 Expand the Etsy Economy. We intend to fulfill our mission to reimagine commerce by expanding the impact of our platform beyond our community. For example, we intend to further develop our manufacturing program, our strategic partnerships and our public-private endeavors to bring the benefit of the Etsy Economy to more people and more communities. \u0095 Invest in Marketing. We believe that the rapid growth of our marketplace is a testament to our compelling value proposition for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers have been our best marketers, sharing their positive experiences with their own communities. Even so, we plan to increase our marketing spending on traditional and online media to increase awareness of our brand and attract additional members to our ecosystem. \n \n 5 \n \n Risks Associated With Our Business Our business is subject to numerous risks described in \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 immediately following this prospectus summary and elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the more significant risks are: \u0095 We have a history of operating losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. \u0095 Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to decline. \u0095 Adherence to our values and our focus on long-term sustainability may negatively influence our short- or medium-term financial performance. \u0095 The authenticity of our marketplace and the connections within our community are important to our success. If we are unable to maintain them, our ability to retain existing members and attract new members could suffer. \u0095 Further expansion into markets outside of the United States is important to the growth of our business but will subject us to risks associated with operations abroad. \u0095 We expect to increase our marketing efforts to help grow our business, but those efforts may not be effective at attracting new members and retaining existing members. \u0095 Our payments system depends on third-party providers and is subject to evolving laws and regulations. \u0095 Our ability to expand our ecosystem is important to the growth of our business. \u0095 We must develop new offerings to respond to our members\u0092 changing needs. \u0095 If the mobile solutions available to Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are not effective, the use of our platform could decline. \u0095 We face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively. See \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 immediately following this prospectus summary for a more thorough discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties we face.

We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion or (c) in which we become a large accelerated filer, which means that we have been public for at least 12 months, have filed at least one annual report and the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our then most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 as the \u0093JOBS Act,\u0094 and references to \u0093emerging growth company\u0094 have the meaning associated with such term in the JOBS Act. In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. \n \n 7 \n \n Glossary The following terms are used throughout this prospectus: Term Definition Active buyer An Etsy buyer is a member who has created an account in our marketplace.

(4) Reflects the conversion of all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock into 106,896,493 shares of common stock as of the date reflected and, on a pro forma basis, our sale of shares of common stock that we are offering at the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The pro forma balance sheet data is illustrative only and will change based on the actual initial public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing. Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase or decrease each of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, working capital, total assets, deferred revenue, long-term liabilities and total stockholders\u0092 equity on a pro forma basis by approximately $ , assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same. We may also increase or decrease the number of shares we are offering. Each increase or decrease by shares in the number of shares offered by us would increase or decrease each of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, working capital, total assets, deferred revenue, long-term liabilities and total stockholders\u0092 equity by approximately $ million, assuming that the assumed initial price to public remains the same, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. \n \n 14 \n \n Risk Factors \n \n Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before deciding whether to purchase shares of our common stock, you should consider carefully the risks and uncertainties described below, our consolidated financial statements and related notes and all of the other information in this prospectus. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected. As a result, the price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. \n \n Risks Related to Our Business and Industry \n \n We have a history of operating losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. \n \n We incurred net losses of $15.2 million, $0.8 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of $32.4 million. We may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future. We expect that our operating expenses will increase substantially as we hire additional employees, increase our marketing efforts, expand our operations and continue to invest in the development of our platform, including new services and features for our members. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and our revenue may not increase sufficiently to offset these additional expenses. In addition, as a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. Further, our revenue growth may slow or our revenue may decline for a number of reasons, including those described in these Risk Factors. \n \n Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate, which could cause our stock price to decline. \n \n Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for a variety of reasons, many of which are beyond our control. These reasons include those described in these Risk Factors as well as the following: \n \n \u0095 fluctuations in revenue generated from Etsy sellers on our platform, including as a result of the seasonality of marketplace transactions and Etsy sellers\u0092 use Seller Services; \n \n \u0095 our success in retaining existing members and attracting new members; \n \n \u0095 the amount and timing of our operating expenses; \n \n \u0095 the timing and success of new services and features we introduce; \n \n \u0095 the impact of competitive developments and our response to those developments; \n \n \u0095 our ability to manage our existing business and future growth; \n \n \u0095 disruptions or defects in our marketplace, such as privacy or data security breaches; and \n \n \u0095 economic and market conditions, particularly those affecting our industry. \n \n 15 \n \n Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause those results to fall below the expectations of analysts or investors, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline. Fluctuations in our results could also cause a number of other problems. For example, analysts or investors might change their models for valuing our common stock, we could experience short-term liquidity issues, our ability to retain or attract key personnel may diminish and other unanticipated issues may arise. \n \n In addition, we believe that our quarterly operating results may vary in the future and that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful. For example, our historical growth may have overshadowed the seasonal effects on our historical operating results. These seasonal effects may become more pronounced over time, which could also cause our operating results to fluctuate. You should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of future performance. \n \n Adherence to our values and our focus on long-term sustainability may negatively influence our short- or medium-term financial performance. \n \n Our values are integral to everything we do, and accordingly, we intend to focus on the long-term sustainability of our business and our ecosystem. We may take actions that we believe will benefit our business and our ecosystem and, therefore, our stockholders over a period of time, even if those actions do not maximize short- or medium-term financial results. However, these longer-term benefits may not materialize within the timeframe we expect or at all. For example: \n \n \u0095 we may choose to prohibit the sale of items in our marketplace that we believe are inconsistent with our values even though we could benefit financially from the sale of those items; \n \n \u0095 we may choose to revise our policies in ways that we believe will be beneficial to our members and our ecosystem in the long term even though the changes are perceived unfavorably among our existing members; or \n \n \u0095 we may take actions, such as investing in alternative forms of shipping or locating our servers in low-impact data centers, that reduce our environmental footprint even though these actions may be more costly than other alternatives. \n \n The authenticity of our marketplace and the connections within our community are important to our success. If we are unable to maintain them, our ability to retain existing members and attract new members could suffer. \n \n We have built an authentic, trusted marketplace that embodies our values-based culture, emphasizing respect, direct communication and fun. We have developed a reputation for authenticity as a result of Etsy sellers\u0092 unique offerings and their adherence to our policies for handmade goods. We establish trust in our marketplace by emphasizing the person behind every transaction. We deepen connections among our members through our direct communication tools, seller stories on our website and our in-person events, making a personal relationship central to the member experience. As part of our community, we also strive to build meaningful connections with our members. For example, each of our employees, including \n \n 16 \n \n management, is expected to perform member support rotations to help foster connections among our community and to help us better understand the needs of our members. The authenticity of our marketplace and the connections among our members are the cornerstones of our business. Many things could undermine these cornerstones, such as: \n \n \u0095 complaints or negative publicity about us or our platform, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents; \n \n \u0095 changes to our policies that our members perceive as inconsistent with our values or that are not clearly articulated; \n \n \u0095 our failure to enforce our policies fairly and transparently, such as by failing to prevent the widespread listing of items in our marketplace that do not comply with our policies; \n \n \u0095 our failure to respond to feedback from our community; or \n \n \u0095 our failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values. \n \n If we are unable to maintain the authenticity of our marketplace and encourage connections among members of our community, then our ability to retain existing members and attract new members could be impaired and our reputation and business could be adversely affected. \n \n In addition, our reputation could be harmed if we lose our status as a Certified B Corporation, whether by our choice or by our failure to meet B Lab\u0092s certification requirements. Likewise, our reputation could be harmed if our publicly reported B Corporation score declines. B Lab, an independent, third-party organization, sets the standards for Certified B Corporation certification and may change those standards over time. \n \n Our growth depends on our ability to attract and retain an active community of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. \n \n In order to increase revenue and to achieve and maintain profitability, we must attract new members and retain existing members. We must also encourage Etsy sellers to list items for sale and use our Seller Services and encourage Etsy buyers to purchase items in our marketplace. \n \n We believe that many of our new members find Etsy by word of mouth and other non-paid referrals from existing members. If existing Etsy sellers are dissatisfied with their experience on our platform, they may stop listing items in our marketplace and may stop referring others to us. Likewise, if existing Etsy buyers do not find our platform appealing, whether because of a negative experience, lack of buyer-friendly features, declining interest in the nature of the goods offered by Etsy sellers or other factors, they may make fewer purchases and they may stop referring others to us. Under these circumstances, we may have difficulty attracting new Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers without incurring additional marketing expense. \n \n 17 \n \n Even if we are able to attract new members to replace members we lose, they may not maintain the same level of activity and the revenue generated from new members may not be as high as the revenue generated from the lost members. If we are unable to retain existing members and attract new members who contribute to an active community, our growth prospects would be harmed and our business could be adversely affected. \n \n Further expansion into markets outside of the United States is important to the growth of our business but will subject us to risks associated with operations abroad. \n \n Expanding our community into markets outside of the United States is an important part of our strategy. Although we have a significant number of members outside of the United States, we have limited experience in developing local markets outside the United States. The nature of the goods that Etsy sellers list in our marketplace may not appeal to non-U.S. consumers in the same way as they do to consumers in the United States. Also, visits to our marketplace from Etsy buyers outside the United States may not convert into sales as often as visits from within the United States. Our success in markets outside the United States will be linked to our ability to attract local Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to our platform. If we are not able to do so, our growth prospects could be harmed. \n \n In addition, competition is likely to intensify in the international markets where we operate and plan to expand our operations. Local companies based in markets outside the United States may have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, those local markets. Some of our competitors may also be able to develop and grow in international markets more quickly than we will. \n \n Continued expansion in markets outside of the United States will also require significant financial investment. These investments include marketing to attract and retain new members, developing localized services, forming relationships with third-party service providers, supporting operations in multiple countries and potentially acquiring companies based outside the United States and integrating those companies with our operations. \n \n Doing business in markets outside of the United States also subjects us to increased risks and burdens such as: \n \n \u0095 complying with different regulatory standards (including those related to the use of personal information, particularly in the European Union); \n \n \u0095 managing and staffing operations over a broader geographic area with varying cultural norms and customs; \n \n \u0095 adapting our platform to local cultural norms and customs; \n \n \u0095 potentially heightened risk of fraudulent transactions; \n \n \u0095 limitations on the repatriation of funds and fluctuations of foreign exchange rates; \n \n 18 \n \n \u0095 exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption, anti-money laundering and export control laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the UK Bribery Act of 2010, trade controls and sanctions administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control, and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions; \n \n \u0095 varying levels of Internet, e-commerce and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure; \n \n \u0095 our ability to enforce contracts and intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the United States; and \n \n \u0095 barriers to international trade, such as tariffs or other taxes. \n \n Etsy sellers face similar risks in conducting their businesses across borders. Even if we are successful in managing the risks of conducting our business across borders, if Etsy sellers are not, our business could be adversely affected. \n \n Finally, operating in markets outside of the United States requires significant management attention. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations outside of the United States and cannot manage these risks effectively, the costs of doing business in those markets may be prohibitive or our expenses may increase disproportionately to the revenue generated in those markets. \n \n We expect to increase our marketing efforts to help grow our business, but those efforts may not be effective at attracting new members and retaining existing members. \n \n Maintaining and promoting awareness of our marketplace and broader platform is important to our ability to retain existing members and to attract new members. We believe that much of the growth in our member base to date has originated from word-of-mouth referrals and other organic means, as our historical marketing efforts and expenditures have been relatively limited. Going forward, we intend to invest more in marketing, with a particular focus on bringing more Etsy buyers to our platform. We anticipate that our marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive as competition increases, and generating a meaningful return on those initiatives may be difficult. Also, the marketing efforts we implement in the future may not succeed as we have limited marketing experience. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of these efforts, that additional revenue may not offset the expenses we incur. \n \n Our marketing efforts currently include search engine marketing and display advertising, as well as search engine optimization, social media usage, mobile \u0093push\u0094 notifications and email. We obtain a significant number of visits via search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!. Search engines frequently change the algorithms that determine the ranking and display of results of a user\u0092s search, and those changes can negatively affect the placement of links to our marketplace and, therefore, reduce the number of visits to our marketplace. We also obtain a significant number of visits through email advertising. If we are unable to successfully deliver emails to our members or if members do not open our emails, whether out of choice, because those emails are marked as low priority or spam or for other reasons, our business could be adversely affected. Social networking websites, such as Facebook and Pinterest, are another important \n \n 19 \n \n source of visits to our marketplace. As online commerce and social networking continue to evolve, we must maintain a presence within these networks. We may be unable to develop or maintain such a presence. \n \n Our payments system depends on third-party providers and is subject to evolving laws and regulations. \n \n Etsy buyers can pay for purchases using Direct Checkout or PayPal. In the United States and other countries where Direct Checkout is available, Etsy buyers can pay with credit cards, debit cards, bank transfers and Etsy gift cards on our platform rather than being directed to a third-party payment platform. A significant portion of our GMS is processed through Direct Checkout, and a portion of our revenue is derived from Direct Checkout. \n \n We have engaged third-party service providers to perform underlying card processing, currency exchange, identity verification and fraud analysis services. If these service providers do not perform adequately or if our relationships with these service providers were to terminate, Etsy sellers\u0092 ability to accept orders could be adversely affected and our business would be harmed. In addition, if these providers increase the fees they charge us, our operating expenses could increase. Alternatively, if we respond by increasing the fees we charge to Etsy sellers, some Etsy sellers may stop using Direct Checkout, stop listing new items for sale or even close their accounts altogether. \n \n The laws and regulations related to payments are complex and vary across different jurisdictions in the United States and globally. As a result, we are required to spend significant time and effort to comply with those laws and regulations. Any failure or claim of our failure to comply, or any failure by our third-party service providers to comply, could cost us substantial resources, could result in liabilities, or could force us to stop offering Direct Checkout. As we expand the availability of Direct Checkout or offer new payment methods to our members in the future, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements. \n \n Further, through our agreement with our third-party credit card processor, we are indirectly subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We are also subject to rules governing electronic funds transfers. Any change in these rules and requirements could make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. \n \n Our ability to expand our ecosystem is important to the growth of our business. \n \n We spend substantial time and resources creating new offerings in order to add new constituents to our ecosystem and to open new sales channels for Etsy sellers. For example, in October 2013, we expanded our ecosystem by allowing Etsy sellers to work with small-batch manufacturers. Additionally, in August 2014, we added traditional retailers to our ecosystem with the launch of our Wholesale offering, which allows Etsy sellers to sell their products to retailers on our platform. \n \n Our efforts to expand our ecosystem could fail for many reasons, including lack of acceptance of our offerings by existing members or new constituents, our failure to market our offerings effectively to new constituents, defects or errors in our new offerings or negative publicity about us or our new offerings. \n \n 20 \n \n Diversifying our offerings and expanding our ecosystem to benefit our community involves significant risk. For example, these initiatives may not drive increases in revenue, may require substantial investment and planning and may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do. It will require additional investment of time and resources in the development and training of our personnel and our members. If we are unable to cost-effectively expand our ecosystem, then our growth prospects and competitive position may be harmed. \n \n We must develop new offerings to respond to our members\u0092 changing needs. \n \n Our industry is characterized by rapidly changing technology, new service and product introductions and changing customer demands. We spend substantial time and resources understanding our members\u0092 needs and responding to them. For example, we are continually developing additional Seller Services, improving search and discovery functionality and enhancing the member experience. Recently, we have focused on providing additional Seller Services and tools to help Etsy sellers manage and scale their businesses. For example, in August 2014, we launched our Wholesale offering. In addition, we developed a mobile app and expanded Direct Checkout to enable an Etsy seller in the United States to use our \u0093Sell on Etsy Reader\u0094 to accept credit card and debit card payments in person, such as at her store or her booth at a craft fair. \n \n Our members may not be satisfied with our new offerings or perceive that the new offerings respond to their needs. Developing new offerings is complex, and the timetable for commercial release is difficult to predict and may vary from our historical experience. As a result, the introduction of new offerings may occur after anticipated or announced release dates. Our new offerings also may bring us more directly into competition with companies that are better established or have greater resources than we do. \n \n If we do not continue to cost-effectively develop new offerings that satisfy our members, then our competitive position and growth prospects may be harmed. In addition, new offerings may have lower margins than existing offerings and our revenue may not grow enough as a result of the new offerings to offset the cost of developing them. \n \n If the mobile solutions available to Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are not effective, the use of our platform could decline. \n \n Visits and purchases made on mobile devices by consumers, including Etsy buyers, have increased significantly in recent years. The smaller screen size and reduced functionality associated with some mobile devices may make the use of our platform more difficult or less appealing to members. Visits to our marketplace on mobile devices may not convert into purchases as often as visits made through personal computers, which could result in less revenue for us. Etsy sellers are also increasingly using mobile devices to operate their businesses on our platform. If we are not able to deliver a rewarding experience on mobile devices, Etsy sellers\u0092 ability to manage and grow their businesses may be harmed and, consequently, our business may suffer. Further, although we strive to provide engaging mobile experiences for both Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers who visit our mobile website using a browser on their mobile device, we depend on Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers downloading our mobile apps to provide them the optimal mobile experience. \n \n 21 \n \n As new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, we may encounter problems in developing or supporting apps for them. In addition, supporting new devices and mobile device operating systems may require substantial time and resources. \n \n The success of our mobile apps could also be harmed by factors outside our control, such as: \n \n \u0095 actions taken by providers of mobile operating systems or mobile app download stores; \n \n \u0095 unfavorable treatment received by our mobile apps, especially as compared to competing apps, such as the placement of our mobile apps in a mobile app download store; \n \n \u0095 increased costs to distribute or have members use our mobile apps; or \n \n \u0095 changes in mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android, that degrade the functionality of our mobile website or mobile apps or that give preferential treatment to competitive products. \n \n If our members encounter difficulty accessing or using our platform on their mobile devices, or if our members choose not to use our platform on their mobile devices, our growth prospects and our business may be adversely affected. \n \n We face intense competition and may not be able to compete effectively. \n \n Our industry is highly competitive and we expect competition to increase in the future. To be successful, we need to attract and retain both Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. As a result, we face competition from a wide range of online and offline competitors. See \u0093Business\u0097Competition.\u0094 \n \n We compete with retailers for Etsy sellers. An Etsy seller can list her goods for sale with online retailers, such as Amazon.com, eBay or Alibaba, or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues or marketplaces. She may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers, including large national retailers, who discover her goods in our marketplace or otherwise. We also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses, enabling an Etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform, such as Square, Intuit and Shopify. \n \n We compete to attract, engage and retain Etsy sellers based on many factors, including: \n \n \u0095 our brand awareness; \n \n \u0095 the breadth of our online presence; \n \n \u0095 the number and engagement of Etsy buyers; \n \n \u0095 the extent to which our Seller Services can ease the administrative tasks that an Etsy seller might encounter in running her business, including through mobile apps; \n \n \u0095 our fees; \n \n 22 \n \n \u0095 the strength of our community; and \n \n \u0095 our values. \n \n In addition, we compete with retailers for the attention of the Etsy buyer. An Etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer, whether large marketplaces, such as Amazon.com, eBay or Alibaba, or national retail chains, such as Pottery Barn or Target, or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces. Many of these competitors offer low-cost or free shipping, fast shipping times, favorable return policies and other features that may be difficult or impossible for Etsy sellers to match. \n \n We compete to attract, engage and retain Etsy buyers based on many factors, including: \n \n \u0095 the unique goods that Etsy sellers list in our marketplace; \n \n \u0095 our brand awareness; \n \n \u0095 the person-to-person commerce experience; \n \n \u0095 our reputation for authenticity; \n \n \u0095 our mobile apps; \n \n \u0095 ease of payment; and \n \n \u0095 the availability and reliability of our platform. \n \n Many of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater resources, better name recognition or more customers than we do. They may invest more to develop and promote their services than we do, and they may offer lower fees to sellers than we do. Additionally, we believe that it is relatively easy for new businesses to create online commerce offerings or tools or services that enable entrepreneurship. \n \n Local companies or more established companies based in markets where we operate outside of the United States may also have a better understanding of local customs, providing them a competitive advantage. For example, in certain markets outside the United States, we compete with smaller, but similar, local online marketplaces with a focus on unique goods that are attempting to attract sellers and buyers in those markets. \n \n If we are unable to compete successfully, or if competing successfully requires us to expend significant resources in response to our competitors\u0092 actions, our business could be adversely affected. \n \n 23 \n \n We may expand our business through acquisitions of other businesses, which may divert management\u0092s attention and/or prove to be unsuccessful. \n \n We have acquired a number of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future. For example, in April 2014 we acquired Jarvis Labs, Inc. (d/b/a Grand St.) and in June 2014 we acquired Incubart SAS (d/b/a A Little Market). Acquisitions may divert management\u0092s time and focus from operating our business. Acquisitions also may require us to spend a substantial portion of our available cash, incur debt or other liabilities, amortize expenses related to intangible assets or incur write-offs of goodwill or other assets. In addition, integrating an acquired business or technology is risky. Completed and future acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties and expenditures associated with: \n \n \u0095 incorporating new businesses and technologies into our infrastructure; \n \n \u0095 consolidating operational and administrative functions; \n \n \u0095 coordinating outreach to our community; \n \n \u0095 maintaining morale and culture and retaining and integrating key employees; \n \n \u0095 maintaining or developing controls, procedures and policies (including effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures); and \n \n \u0095 assuming liabilities related to the activities of the acquired business before the acquisition, including liabilities for violations of laws and regulations, commercial disputes, taxes and other matters. \n \n Moreover, we may not benefit from our acquisitions as we expect, or in the time frame we expect. We also may issue additional equity securities in connection with an acquisition, which could cause dilution to our stockholders. Finally, acquisitions could be viewed negatively by analysts, investors or our members. \n \n Our ability to recruit and retain employees is important to our success. \n \n We strive to attract and motivate employees, from our office administrators to our management team, who share our dedication to our community and our mission. \n \n Some of the challenges we face in attracting and retaining employees include: \n \n \u0095 preserving our company culture as we grow; \n \n \u0095 continuing to attract and retain employees who share our values; \n \n \u0095 promoting existing employees into leadership positions to help sustain and grow our culture; \n \n \u0095 hiring employees in multiple locations globally; \n \n \u0095 responding to competitive pressures and changing business conditions in ways that do not divert us from our values; and \n \n 24 \n \n \u0095 integrating new personnel and businesses from acquisitions. \n \n Our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees, including our management team, is important to our success. In general, our key personnel work for us on an at-will basis. Other companies, including our competitors, may be successful in recruiting and hiring our employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely basis or on competitive terms. \n \n Filling engineering, product management and other technical positions in the New York City area is particularly challenging, especially in light of our distinctive technology philosophy and engineering culture. Qualified individuals are limited and in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract, develop and motivate them. Even if we were to offer higher compensation and other benefits, people with suitable technical skills may choose not to join us or to continue to work for us. If we are not able to maintain our engineering culture and broader company culture, then our ability to recruit and retain employees could suffer and our business would be harmed. \n \n The growth of our business may strain our management team and our operational and financial infrastructure. \n \n We have experienced rapid growth in our business, such as in headcount, the number of Etsy sellers and the number of countries in which we have members, and we plan to continue to grow in the future, both in the United States and abroad. For example, our headcount has grown from 251 employees on December 31, 2011 to 685 employees on December 31, 2014, an increase of 172.9%. The growth of our business places significant demands on our management team and pressure to expand our operational and financial infrastructure. As we continue to grow, our operating expenses will increase. If we do not manage our growth effectively, the increases in our operating expenses could outpace any increases in our revenue and our business could be harmed. \n \n Continued growth could also pose other challenges, such as the need to develop and improve our operational, financial and management controls and to enhance our reporting systems and procedures. For example, in 2013 we began implementing a new enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system to enhance a variety of important functions such as invoicing, accounts receivable, accounts payable, foreign currency translation, financial consolidation and internal and external financial and management reporting matters. ERP system implementations are complex, long-term projects that involve substantial expenditures. To fully realize the benefits of the new ERP system we must also make significant changes to our business and financial processes. Our business may be harmed if the ERP system does not function as expected or does not result in the expected benefits. \n \n We rely on Etsy sellers to provide a fulfilling experience to Etsy buyers. \n \n A small portion of Etsy buyers complain to us about their experience with our platform. For example, Etsy buyers may report that they have not received the items that they purchased, that the items received were not as represented by an Etsy seller or that an Etsy seller has not been responsive to their questions. \n \n 25 \n \n Negative publicity and member sentiment generated as a result of these types of complaints could reduce our ability to attract new members or retain our current members or damage our reputation. A perception that our levels of responsiveness and member support are inadequate could have similar results. In some situations, we may choose to reimburse Etsy buyers for their purchases to help avoid harm to our reputation, but we may not be able to recover the funds we expend for those reimbursements. \n \n Anything that disrupts the operations of a substantial number of Etsy sellers, such as interruptions in delivery services, natural disasters, inclement weather, public health crises or political unrest, could also result in negative experiences for a substantial number of Etsy buyers. \n \n Etsy sellers rely on third-party services to deliver their orders. \n \n Etsy sellers work with a number of third-party services such as FedEx, UPS, the United States Postal Service and Canada Post to deliver their products to Etsy buyers. Anything that prevents timely delivery of goods to Etsy buyers could harm Etsy sellers and could negatively affect our reputation. Delays or interruptions may be caused by events that are beyond the control of the delivery services, such as inclement weather, natural disasters, transportation disruptions, terrorism, public health crises or labor unrest. For example, certain delivery services were reported to have been overwhelmed by the volume of shipments during the 2013 holiday season, resulting in significant delays in delivery times. The delivery services could also be affected by industry consolidation, insolvency or government shut-downs. Although we have agreements with certain delivery services that enable us to provide pre-paid shipping labels as a convenience to Etsy sellers, our agreements do not require these providers to offer delivery services to Etsy sellers. Further, our competitors could obtain preferential rates or shipping services, causing Etsy sellers to pay higher shipping costs or find alternative delivery services. If the goods sold in our marketplace are not delivered in proper condition, on a timely basis or at shipping rates that Etsy buyers are willing to pay, our reputation and our business could be adversely affected. \n \n Our reputation may be harmed if members of our community use unethical business practices. \n \n Our emphasis on our values makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of unethical business practices by Etsy sellers or other members of our community. Our policies promote legal and ethical business practices, such as encouraging Etsy sellers to work only with manufacturers who do not use child or involuntary labor, who do not discriminate and who promote sustainability and humane working conditions. However, we do not control Etsy sellers or other members of our community or their business practices and cannot ensure that they comply with our policies. If members of our community engage in illegal or unethical business practices or are perceived to do so, we may receive negative publicity and our reputation may be harmed. \n \n Failure to deal effectively with fraud could harm our business. \n \n Although we have measures in place to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent activity in our marketplace, those measures may not always be effective. \n \n 26 \n \n For example, Etsy sellers occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent or stolen credit card data. Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders placed through Direct Checkout with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Although we attempt to detect or challenge allegedly fraudulent transactions, we may not be able to do so effectively. As a result, our business could be adversely affected. We could also incur significant fines or lose our ability to give members the option of paying with credit cards if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards or fail to limit fraudulent transactions conducted in our marketplace. \n \n Negative publicity and member sentiment resulting from fraudulent or deceptive conduct by members or the perception that our levels of responsiveness and member support are inadequate could reduce our ability to attract new members or retain existing members and damage our reputation. \n \n If sensitive information about our members is disclosed, or if we or our third-party providers are subject to cyber attacks, our members may curtail use of our platform, we may be exposed to liability and our reputation would suffer. \n \n We collect, transmit and store personal and financial information provided by our members, such as names, email addresses, the details of transactions and credit card and other financial information. Some of our third-party service providers, such as identity verification and payment processing providers, also regularly have access to member data. In an effort to protect sensitive information, we rely on a variety of security measures, including encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties. However, advances in computer capabilities, increasingly sophisticated tools and methods used by hackers and cyber terrorists, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in our failure or inability to adequately protect sensitive information. The preventive measures we take to address these risks are costly and may become more costly in the future. \n \n Like all online services, our platform is vulnerable to power outages, telecommunications failures and catastrophic events, as well as computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber attacks. Any of these incidents could lead to interruptions or shutdowns of our platform, loss of data or unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable or other sensitive information. Cyber attacks could also result in the theft of our intellectual property. If we gain greater visibility, we may face a higher risk of being targeted by cyber attacks. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in cyber attacks becoming more sophisticated and more difficult to detect. We and our third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all such cyber attacks. Moreover, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. Security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or employees of our third-party service providers. \n \n We and our third-party service providers regularly experience cyber attacks aimed at disrupting our and our third-party service providers\u0092 services. If we or our third-party service providers experience security breaches that result in marketplace performance or availability problems or the loss or unauthorized \n \n 27 \n \n disclosure of sensitive information, people may become unwilling to provide us the information necessary to set up member accounts. Existing members may also decrease their purchases or stop listing new items for sale or close their accounts altogether. We could also face potential liability and litigation, which may not be adequately covered by insurance. Any of these results could harm our growth prospects, our business and our reputation. \n \n Our business depends on network and mobile infrastructure provided by third parties and on our ability to maintain and scale the technology underlying our platform. \n \n The reliability of our platform is important to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain members. As our number of members, volume of traffic, number of transactions and the amount of information shared on our platform grow, our need for additional network capacity and computing power will also grow. The operation of the technology underlying our platform is expensive and complex, and we could experience operational failures. If we fail to accurately predict the rate or timing of the growth of our platform, we may be required to incur significant additional costs to maintain reliability. \n \n We also depend on the development and maintenance of the Internet and mobile infrastructure. This includes maintenance of reliable Internet and mobile networks with the necessary speed, data capacity and security, as well as timely development of complementary products. \n \n Third-party providers host much of our technology infrastructure. Any disruption in their services, or any failure of our providers to handle the demands of our marketplace could significantly harm our business. We exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability to their financial conditions and to problems with the services they provide. If we experience failures in our technology infrastructure or do not expand our technology infrastructure successfully, then our ability to attract and retain members could be adversely affected, which could harm our growth prospects and our business. \n \n Our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet and mobile networks. \n \n Our members rely on access to the Internet or mobile networks to access our marketplace. Internet service providers may choose to disrupt or degrade our members\u0092 access to our platform or increase the cost of such access. Mobile network operators or operating system providers could block or place onerous restrictions on our members\u0092 ability to download and use our mobile apps. \n \n Internet service providers or mobile network operators could also attempt to charge us for providing access to our platform. Although the Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, recently approved new rules that would prohibit Internet service providers from charging content providers higher rates in order to deliver their content over certain \u0093fast traffic\u0094 lanes, these rules will not go into effect until later this year and could be subject to legal challenge or statutory preemption, which could delay or prevent implementation. If the FCC\u0092s rules are not implemented, our business could be adversely impacted. Outside of the United States, government regulation of the Internet, including the idea of network neutrality, may be developing or non-existent. As a result, we could face discriminatory or anti-competitive practices that could impede both our and Etsy sellers\u0092 growth prospects, increase our costs and harm our business. \n \n 28 \n \n Our business is subject to a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. laws, many of which are evolving. \n \n We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and around the world, including those relating to traditional businesses, such as employment laws and taxation, and newer laws and regulations focused on the Internet and online commerce, such as payment systems, privacy, anti-spam, data protection, electronic contracts and consumer protection. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving, and compliance is costly and can require changes to our business practices and significant management time and effort. Additionally, it is not always clear how existing laws apply to the Internet as many of these laws do not address the unique issues raised by the Internet or online commerce. \n \n For example, laws relating to online privacy are evolving differently in different jurisdictions. Federal, state and non-U.S. governmental authorities, as well as courts interpreting the laws, continue to evaluate the privacy implications of the use of third-party \u0093cookies,\u0094 \u0093web beacons\u0094 and other methods of online tracking. The United States, the European Union and other governments have enacted or are considering legislation that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to collect and store user information, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools. \n \n Some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented, or have announced plans to implement, ways to block tracking technologies which, if widely adopted, could also result in online tracking methods becoming significantly less effective. Any reduction in our ability to make effective use of such technologies could harm our ability to personalize the experience of Etsy buyers, increase our costs and limit our ability to attract new members and retain existing members on cost-effective terms. As a result, our business could be adversely affected. \n \n In some cases, non-U.S. privacy, data protection, consumer protection and other laws and regulations are more restrictive than those in the United States. For example, the European Union traditionally has imposed stricter obligations under such laws than the United States. Consequently, the expansion of our operations internationally may require changes to the ways we collect and use consumer information. \n \n Existing and future laws and regulations enacted by federal, state or non-U.S. governments could impede the growth or use of the Internet or online commerce. It is also possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our platform or may even attempt to block access to our platform. If we are restricted from operating in one or more countries, our ability to attract or retain members may be adversely affected and we may not be able to grow our business as we anticipate. \n \n We strive to comply with all applicable laws, but they may conflict with each other, and by complying with the laws or regulations of one jurisdiction, we may find that we are violating the laws or regulations of another jurisdiction. Despite our efforts, we may not have fully complied in the past and may not in the future. If we become liable under laws or regulations applicable to us, we could be required to pay significant fines and penalties, and we may be forced to change the way we operate. That could require us to incur significant expenses or to discontinue certain services, which could negatively affect our business. \n \n 29 \n \n Additionally, if third parties with whom we work violate applicable laws or our policies, those violations could result in other liabilities for us and could harm our business. \n \n We may be unable to protect our intellectual property adequately. \n \n Our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business. To establish and protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark and, to a lesser extent, patent laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. The efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be sufficient or effective. We generally do not elect to register our copyrights or the majority of our trademarks, relying instead on the laws protecting unregistered intellectual property, which may not be sufficient. In addition, our copyrights and trademarks, whether or not registered, and patents, may be held invalid or unenforceable if challenged. While we have obtained or applied for patent protection with respect to some of our intellectual property, we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property. To the extent we do seek patent protection, any U.S. or other patents issued to us may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. \n \n In addition, we may not be effective in policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property. Even if we do detect violations, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any enforcement efforts we undertake, including litigation, could be time-consuming and expensive and could divert our management\u0092s attention. In addition, our efforts may be met with defenses and counterclaims challenging the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights or may result in a court determining that our intellectual property rights are unenforceable. If we are unable to cost-effectively protect our intellectual property rights, then our business could be harmed. \n \n We may be subject to claims that items listed in our marketplace are counterfeit, infringing or illegal. \n \n Although we do not create or take possession of the items listed in our marketplace by Etsy sellers, we frequently receive communications alleging that items listed in our marketplace infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks, patents or other intellectual property rights. We have intellectual property complaint and take-down procedures in place to address these communications, and we believe such procedures are important to promote confidence in our marketplace. We follow these procedures to review complaints and relevant facts to determine whether to take the appropriate action, which may include removal of the item from our marketplace and, in certain cases, closing the shops of Etsy sellers who repeatedly violate our policies. \n \n Our procedures may not effectively reduce or eliminate our liability. In particular, we may be subject to civil or criminal liability for activities carried out by Etsy sellers on our platform, especially outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Under current U.S. copyright law and the Communications Decency Act, we may benefit from statutory safe harbor provisions that protect us from liability for content posted by our members. However, trademark and patent laws do not include similar statutory provisions, liability for these forms of intellectual property is often \n \n 30 \n \n determined by court decisions. These safe harbors and court rulings may change unfavorably. In that event, we may be held secondarily liable for the intellectual property infringement of Etsy sellers. \n \n Regardless of the validity of any claims made against us, we may incur significant costs and efforts to defend against or settle them. If a governmental authority determines that we have aided and abetted the infringement or sale of counterfeit goods or if legal changes result in us potentially being liable for actions by Etsy sellers on our platform, we could face regulatory, civil or criminal penalties. Successful claims by third-party rights owners could require us to pay substantial damages or refrain from permitting any further listing of the relevant items. These types of claims could force us to modify our business practices, which could lower our revenue, increase our costs or make our platform less user-friendly for our members. Moreover, public perception that counterfeit or other unauthorized items are common in our marketplace, even if factually incorrect, could result in negative publicity and damage to our reputation. \n \n We may be subject to intellectual property claims, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future. \n \n Companies in the Internet and technology industries are frequently subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We periodically receive notices that claim we have infringed, misappropriated or misused other parties\u0092 intellectual property rights. To the extent we gain greater public recognition, we may face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property claims. Third-party intellectual property rights may cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods or block us from expanding our offerings. Any intellectual property claim against us, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to settle or litigate and could divert the attention of our management. Litigation regarding intellectual property rights is inherently uncertain due to the complex issues involved, and we may not be successful in defending ourselves in such matters. \n \n In addition, some of our competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents. Many potential litigants, including some of our competitors and patent holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantial resources to enforcing their intellectual property rights. Any claims successfully brought against us could subject us to significant liability for damages and we may be required to stop using technology or other intellectual property alleged to be in violation of a third party\u0092s rights. We also might be required to seek a license for third-party intellectual property. Even if a license is available, we could be required to pay significant royalties or submit to unreasonable terms, which would increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit our service and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results could harm our business. \n \n 31 \n \n We may be involved in litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming. \n \n In addition to intellectual property claims, we may become involved in other litigation matters, including class action lawsuits. Any lawsuit to which we are a party, with or without merit, may result in an unfavorable judgment. We also may decide to settle lawsuits on unfavorable terms. Any such negative outcome could result in payments of substantial damages or fines, damage to our reputation or adverse changes to our offerings or business practices. Any of these results could adversely affect our business. In addition, defending claims is costly and can impose a significant burden on our management. \n \n Our software is highly complex and may contain undetected errors. \n \n The software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been released. We rely heavily on a software engineering practice known as \u0093continuous deployment,\u0094 meaning that we typically release software code many times per day. This practice may result in the more frequent introduction of errors or vulnerabilities into the software underlying our platform. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code after release could result in damage to our reputation, loss of members, loss of revenue or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our growth prospects and our business. \n \n We are subject to the terms of open source licenses because our platform incorporates open source software. \n \n The software powering our marketplace incorporates software covered by open source licenses. In addition, we regularly contribute source code to open source software projects and release internal software projects under open source licenses, and we anticipate doing so in the future. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts and there is a risk that the licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to operate our marketplace. Under certain open source licenses, we could be required to publicly release the source code of our software or to make our software available under open source licenses. To avoid the public release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software. In addition, use of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Additionally, because any software source code we contribute to open source projects is publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we will be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of these risks could be difficult to eliminate or manage and, if not addressed, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. \n \n 32 \n \n Our business and our members may be subject to sales and other taxes. \n \n The application of indirect taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, or VAT, provincial taxes, goods and services tax, business tax and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours and to our members is a complex and evolving issue. For example, as of January 1, 2015, the European Union imposed an obligation on marketplaces to collect and remit VAT on sales of automatically-downloaded digital items, and we are in the process of implementing such collection and remittance procedures. Significant judgment is required to evaluate applicable tax obligations and as a result amounts recorded are estimates and could change. In many cases, the ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how existing statutes apply to our business or to Etsy sellers\u0092 businesses. One or more states, the federal government or other countries may seek to impose additional reporting, record-keeping or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours that facilitate online commerce. For example, the U.S. Congress is currently considering the \u0093Marketplace Fairness Act,\u0094 which would grant states the authority to require online merchants to collect sales tax on online sales at the time a transaction is completed. New taxes could also require us or Etsy sellers to incur substantial costs to capture data and collect and remit taxes. If such obligations were imposed, the additional costs associated with tax collection, remittance and audit requirements could make selling in our marketplace less attractive and more costly for Etsy sellers, which could adversely affect our business. \n \n We may experience fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate. \n \n We are subject to taxation in the United States and in numerous other jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on current tax payments and our estimates of future tax payments, which may include reserves for estimates of probable settlements of tax audits. At any one time, multiple tax years could be subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions. As a result, we expect that throughout the year there could be ongoing variability in our quarterly tax rates as taxable events occur and exposures are re-evaluated. Further, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws, changes in the mix of revenue among different jurisdictions, changes to accounting rules and changes to our ownership or capital structure. Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate could adversely affect our business. \n \n In January 2015, we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations and future expansion plans outside of the United States. Our new corporate structure changes how we use our intellectual property and implements certain intercompany arrangements, which we expect may result in a reduction in our overall effective tax rate and other operational efficiencies. The tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to interpretation, and their application may depend on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure. Moreover, these tax laws are subject to change. Tax authorities may disagree with our position as to the tax treatment of our transfer of intangible assets or determine that the manner in which we operate our business does not achieve the intended tax consequences. If our new corporate structure does not achieve our expectations for any of these or other reasons, we may be subject to a higher overall effective tax rate and our business may be adversely affected. \n \n 33 \n \n We rely on consumer discretionary spending and may be adversely affected by economic downturns and other macroeconomic conditions or trends. \n \n Macroeconomic conditions may adversely affect our business. If general economic conditions deteriorate in the United States or other markets where we operate, consumer discretionary spending may decline and demand for the goods available in our marketplace may be reduced. This would cause sales in our marketplace to decline and adversely impact our business. Conversely, if recent trends supporting self-employment and the desire for supplemental income were to reverse, the number of Etsy sellers offering their goods in our marketplace could decline and the number of goods listed in our marketplace could decline. \n \n Even without changes in economic conditions, the demand for the goods listed in our marketplace is dependent on consumer preferences. Consumer preferences can change quickly and may differ across generations and cultures. If demand for the goods that Etsy sellers offer in our marketplace declines, our business would be harmed. Trends in socially-conscious consumerism and buying locally could also shift or slow to the detriment of our business. Our growth prospects would also be hampered if the shift to online and mobile commerce does not continue. \n \n The terms of our debt instruments may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies. \n \n We do not currently have any obligations outstanding under our credit facility. However, our credit facility requires us, and any debt instruments we may enter into in the future may require us, to comply with various covenants that limit our ability to take actions such as: \n \n \u0095 disposing of assets; \n \n \u0095 completing mergers or acquisitions; \n \n \u0095 incurring additional indebtedness; \n \n \u0095 encumbering our properties or assets; \n \n \u0095 paying dividends or making other distributions; \n \n \u0095 making specified investments; and \n \n \u0095 engaging in transactions with our affiliates. \n \n These restrictions could limit our ability to pursue our business strategies. If we default under our credit facility and if the default is not cured or waived, the lenders could terminate their commitments to lend to us and cause any amounts outstanding to be payable immediately. Such a default could also result in cross defaults under other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon a default. Moreover, any such default would limit our ability to obtain additional financing, which may have an adverse effect on our cash flow and liquidity. \n \n 34 \n \n We may need additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. \n \n We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under our credit facility, will be enough to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, we may require additional cash resources due to changed business conditions or other developments, such as acquisitions or investments we may decide to pursue. If our resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we may seek to borrow funds under our credit facility or sell additional equity or debt securities. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Borrowing funds would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in additional operating and financial covenants that would limit our operations. It is also possible that financing may not be available to us in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. \n \n If our insurance coverage is insufficient or our insurers are unable to meet their obligations, our insurance may not mitigate the risks facing our business. \n \n We contract for insurance to cover a number of risks and potential liabilities. Our insurance policies cover areas such as general liability, errors and omissions liability, employment liability, business interruptions, data breach, crime, product liability and directors\u0092 and officers\u0092 liability. For certain types of business risk, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate the risks we face or we may have to pay high premiums and/or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. Additionally, if any of our insurers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any claims that we make. \n \n We are an emerging growth company and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. \n \n We are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we intend to take advantage of some of the exemptions from the reporting requirements applicable to other public companies. For example, we intend to take advantage of the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and the exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments. It is possible that investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions. If so, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. \n \n We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.0 billion or (c) in which we become a large accelerated filer, which means that we have been public for at least 12 months, have filed at least one annual report and the market value of our common \n \n 35 \n \n stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our then most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. \n \n Operating as a public company will require us to incur substantial costs and will require substantial management attention. In addition, our management team has limited experience managing a public company. \n \n As a public company, we will incur substantial legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. For example, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, or the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. The rules and regulations of Nasdaq will also apply to us following this offering. As part of the new requirements, we will need to establish and maintain effective disclosure and financial controls and make changes to our corporate governance practices. We expect that compliance with these requirements will increase our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming. \n \n Most of our management and other personnel have little experience managing a public company and preparing public filings. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from other business matters to devote substantial time to the reporting and other requirements of being a public company. In particular, we expect to incur significant expense and devote substantial management effort to complying with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge. \n \n Our management will not be required to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting until the end of the fiscal year for which our second annual report is due. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy of our financial reports. \n \n As a public company, we will be required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal controls. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Beginning with our second annual report following this offering, we will be required to provide a management report on internal control over financial reporting. When we are no longer an emerging growth company, our management report on internal control over financial reporting will need to be attested to by our independent registered public accounting firm. We do not expect to have our independent registered public accounting firm attest to our management report on internal control over financial reporting while we are an emerging growth company. \n \n If we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated. In addition, our internal control \n \n 36 \n \n over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and fraud. Because of the inherent limitations in \n \n all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected. \n \n If there are material weaknesses or failures in our ability to meet any of the requirements related to the maintenance and reporting of our internal controls, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and that could cause the price of our common stock to decline. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional management attention and which could adversely affect our business. \n \n As described below we currently have two material weaknesses, which we are in the process of remediating. \n \n We currently have identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that, if not corrected, could result in material misstatements of our financial statements. \n \n In connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2014, we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. \n \n First, we determined that we did not have adequate procedures and controls to appropriately account for certain non-income tax-related expenses and comply with the related filing requirements. Second, we determined that we did not have adequate cut-off procedures to ensure the timely recording of certain period-end accruals. \n \n These two material weaknesses resulted in a misstatement of expenses in prior periods that were immaterial to previously issued annual financial statements but in combination were material to certain interim periods. The impact of these material weaknesses resulted in the revision of our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013, for the three months ended March 31, 2013, the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, the three months ended December 31, 2013 and the three months ended September 30, 2014. The impacts of these material weaknesses also resulted in the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2014, the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014. \n \n Neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm has performed an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In light of the material weaknesses that were identified, we believe that it is possible that additional material weaknesses and control deficiencies may have been identified if such an evaluation had been performed. \n \n 37 \n \n We are working to remediate the material weaknesses. We have taken steps to enhance our internal control environment and plan to take additional steps to remediate the material weaknesses. Specifically: \n \n \u0095 we began building an in-house tax function in early 2014 and have added a global head of tax, senior tax manager of planning and a dedicated senior state tax accountant and plan to add an experienced director of tax accounting. We have also hired additional qualified personnel in our accounts payable function, including an experienced supervisor, and plan to add an additional experienced senior accountant. We will continue to evaluate the structure of the finance organization and add resources as needed; \n \n \u0095 we are implementing additional internal reporting procedures, including those designed to add depth to our review processes and improve our segregation of duties; \n \n \u0095 we are updating our systems so that we may collect the necessary information to enable us to more effectively monitor and comply with applicable non-income tax-filing requirements on a timely basis; \n \n \u0095 we are improving the communication and coordination among our finance departments and our record-keeping procedures and we have expanded cross-functional involvement and input into period-end accruals. We are also planning enhancements in our procure-to-pay process as well as additions to analytical procedures used to assess period-end accruals; and \n \n \u0095 we are in the process of documenting, assessing and testing our internal control over financial reporting as part of our efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. \n \n The actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review as well as audit committee oversight. Although we plan to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take, and our efforts may not be successful in remediating these material weaknesses. In addition, we will incur additional costs in improving our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to successfully remediate these material weaknesses or if we identify additional material weaknesses, we may not detect errors on a timely basis. This could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our SEC reporting obligations or Nasdaq listing requirements on a timely basis, adversely affect our reputation, cause our stock price to decline or result in inaccurate financial reporting or material misstatements in our annual or interim financial statements. \n \n Our business could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises or other unexpected events. \n \n Natural disasters and other adverse weather and climate conditions, public health crises, political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war and other political instability, or other unexpected events, could disrupt our operations, Internet or mobile networks, or the operations of one or more of our service providers. For example, when Hurricane Sandy struck New York in October 2012, although our data centers were unaffected, our headquarters in Brooklyn was closed for five days, and we experienced a heavy volume of \n \n 38 \n \n member support requests which required us to devote additional resources to handle those requests. Events of this type could also impact Etsy sellers\u0092 ability to continue producing goods for sale in our marketplace. In addition, such events could negatively impact consumer spending in the affected regions. If any of these events occurs, our business could be adversely affected. \n \n 39 \n \n Risks Related to This Offering and Ownership of Our Common Stock \n \n The price of our common stock could be volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above our initial public offering price. Declines in the price of common stock could subject us to litigation. \n \n There has not been a public market for our common stock prior to this offering and an active trading market may not develop following this offering. Even if such a market does develop, it may not be sustainable. If trading in our common stock is not active, you may not be able to sell your shares quickly, at the market price or at all. The initial public offering price for the shares was determined by negotiations between us and the representative of the underwriters and may not be indicative of prices that will prevail in the trading market following this offering. In addition, the trading prices of the securities of technology companies have historically been highly volatile. Accordingly, the price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations for many reasons, many of which are beyond our control, including those described in these Risk Factors and others such as: \n \n \u0095 variations in our operating results and other financial and operational metrics, including the key financial and operating metrics disclosed in this prospectus, as well as how those results and metrics compare to analyst and investor expectations; \n \n \u0095 speculation about our operating results in the absence of our own financial projections; \n \n \u0095 failure of analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in their estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by analysts that follow our common stock; \n \n \u0095 announcements of new services or enhancements, strategic alliances or significant agreements or other developments by us or our competitors; \n \n \u0095 announcements by us or our competitors of mergers or acquisitions or rumors of such transactions involving us or our competitors; \n \n \u0095 changes in our board of directors, management or other key personnel; \n \n \u0095 disruptions in our marketplace due to hardware, software or network problems, security breaches or other issues; \n \n \u0095 the strength of the global economy or the economy in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and market conditions in our industry and those affecting our members; \n \n \u0095 trading activity by our principal stockholders, including upon the expiration of contractual lock-up agreements; \n \n \u0095 the performance of the equity markets in general and in our industry; \n \n \u0095 the operating performance of other similar companies; \n \n 40 \n \n \u0095 changes in legal requirements relating to our business; \n \n \u0095 litigation or other claims against us; \n \n \u0095 the number of shares of our common stock that are available for public trading; and \n \n \u0095 any other factors discussed in this prospectus. \n \n In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, results of operations or financial condition. The price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies, even if those events do not directly affect us. Some companies that have experienced volatility in the trading price of their stock have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we are the subject of such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and could divert our management\u0092s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. \n \n We have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering and may not use them effectively. \n \n The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our visibility, create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including continued investments in the growth of our business. We also intend to use $300,000 of the proceeds of this offering to partially fund Etsy.org, a Delaware non-profit organization that we formed in January 2015. We may use a portion of the net proceeds to fund the build-out of our new corporate headquarters. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds received by us from this offering for acquisitions of other complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. However, we have no current understandings, agreements or commitments for any specific material acquisitions at this time. Except with respect to Etsy.org, we have not yet determined the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds we receive from this offering. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the allocation and use of the net proceeds. See \u0093Use of Proceeds.\u0094 \n \n The failure by our management to allocate or use these funds effectively could harm our business. Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds we receive from this offering in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value. Our ultimate use of the net proceeds from this offering may vary substantially from their currently intended use. \n \n We do not intend to pay dividends on our capital stock, so any returns will be limited to increases in the value of our common stock. \n \n We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business. Accordingly, we do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock is restricted by the terms of our credit facility and is likely to be restricted by \n \n 41 \n \n any future debt financing arrangement we enter into. Any return to stockholders will therefore be limited to increases in the price of our common stock, if any. \n \n Our directors, executive officers and principal stockholders beneficially own a substantial percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval. \n \n Our directors, executive officers, greater than 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates will hold in the aggregate approximately % of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock following this offering, assuming no exercise of the underwriters\u0092 option to purchase additional shares of our common stock in this offering. Therefore, these stockholders will continue to have the ability to influence us through their ownership position, even after this offering. If these stockholders act together, they may be able to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders will be able to control elections of directors, amendments of our charter documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our capital stock that other stockholders may feel are in their best interests. \n \n If you purchase our common stock in this offering, you will incur immediate and substantial dilution. \n \n The initial public offering price is substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock of $ per share as of December 31, 2014. Investors purchasing common stock in this offering will pay a price per share that substantially exceeds the net tangible book value per share. As a result, investors purchasing common stock in this offering will incur immediate dilution of $ per share, based on the initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the price range on the cover page of this prospectus. \n \n This dilution is due to the substantially lower price paid by our investors who purchased shares prior to this offering as compared to the price offered to the public in this offering. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, there were outstanding options to purchase 23,050,594 shares of our common stock with a weighted average exercise price of approximately $2.67 per share and warrants to purchase 406,060 shares of our common stock (including preferred stock on an as-converted basis) with a weighted average exercise price of approximately $0.66 per share. The exercise of any of these options or warrants would result in additional dilution. As a result of the dilution to investors purchasing shares in this offering, investors may receive less than the purchase price paid in this offering in the event of our liquidation. See \u0093Dilution.\u0094 \n \n Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders following this offering could cause the price of our common stock to decline. \n \n Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We cannot predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing price of our common stock. \n \n 42 \n \n All of our executive officers and directors and the holders of substantially all of our capital stock are subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters of this offering that restrict the stockholders\u0092 ability to transfer shares of our common stock for periods of at least 180 days, and for a portion of the shares, 270 and 360 days from the date of this prospectus. The lock-up agreements limit the number of shares of common stock that may be sold immediately following this offering. Subject to certain limitations, approximately shares will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the 180-day lock-up period, approximately shares will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the 270-day lock-up period and approximately shares will become eligible for sale upon expiration of the 360-day lock-up period. In addition, based on our capitalization as of December 31, 2014, shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding warrants will also be eligible for sale upon expiration of the 180-day lock-up period. We intend to register all of the shares underlying outstanding options and any shares underlying other equity incentives we may grant in the future for public resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Accordingly, these shares will be able to be freely sold in the public market upon issuance to the extent permitted by any applicable vesting requirements and the lock-up agreements described above. Sales of stock by these stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. \n \n Certain holders of shares of our common stock have registration rights. See \u0093Description of Capital Stock\u0097Registration Rights.\u0094 Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act, except for shares held by our affiliates as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Sales of securities by any of these stockholders could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. \n \n Future sales and issuances of our common stock or rights to purchase common stock could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. \n \n We may issue additional common stock, convertible securities or other equity following the completion of this offering. We also expect to issue common stock to our employees, directors and other service providers pursuant to our equity incentive plans. Such issuances could be dilutive to investors and could cause the price of our common stock to decline. New investors in such issuances could also receive rights senior to those of holders of our common stock. \n \n If analysts do not publish research about our business or if they publish inaccurate or unfavorable research, our stock price and trading volume could decline. \n \n The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that analysts publish about our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our common stock would likely decline. If few analysts cover us, demand for our common stock could decrease and our common stock price and trading volume may decline. Similar results may occur if one or more of these analysts stop covering us in the future or fail to publish reports on us regularly. \n \n 43 \n \n Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, could limit attempts to make changes in our management and could depress the price of our common stock. \n \n Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or limiting changes in our management. Among other things, these provisions: \n \n \u0095 establish a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one time; \n \n \u0095 permit our board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships; \n \n \u0095 provide that directors may only be removed for cause; \n \n \u0095 require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws; \n \n \u0095 authorize the issuance of \u0093blank check\u0094 preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a stockholder rights plan; \n \n \u0095 eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders; \n \n \u0095 prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which means all stockholder actions must be taken at a meeting of our stockholders; \n \n \u0095 provide that our board of directors is expressly authorized to amend or repeal any provision of our bylaws; \n \n \u0095 restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware; and \n \n \u0095 establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings. \n \n These provisions may delay or prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace members of our management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company. Section 203 imposes certain restrictions on mergers, business combinations and other transactions between us and holders of 15% or more of our common stock. Anti-takeover provisions could depress the price of our common stock by acting to delay or prevent a change in control of our company. \n \n For information regarding these and other provisions, see \u0093Description of Capital Stock.\u0094 \n \n 44 \n \n Our certificate of incorporation will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u0092 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. \n \n Our certificate of incorporation will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u0092s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions. \n \n 45 \n \n Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements \n \n This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that are based on our beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to us. The forward-looking statements are contained principally in \u0093Prospectus Summary,\u0094 \u0093Risk Factors,\u0094 \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u0094 \u0093Letter from Chad\u0094 and \u0093Business.\u0094 Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations and expenses, business strategies and plans, competitive position, business environment and potential growth opportunities.

This information involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. \n \n In addition, industry publications, studies and surveys generally state that they have been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, although they do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of such information. While we believe that each of these studies and publications is reliable, we have not independently verified market and industry data from third parties. Likewise, while we believe our internal company data is reliable and the definitions of these key operating metrics are appropriate, neither such data nor these definitions have been verified by any independent source. \n \n 47 \n \n Use of Proceeds \n \n We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the issuance of our common stock in this offering, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $ million, or approximately $ million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, assuming an initial public offering price of $ per share, which is the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus. \n \n We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. \n \n Each $1.00 increase (or decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase (or decrease) net proceeds to us by $ million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Each 1,000,000 increase (or decrease) in the number of shares of common stock offered by us would increase (or decrease) net proceeds to us by approximately $ million, assuming an initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the price range on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. \n \n The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our visibility, create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes, including continued investments in the growth of our business. Consistent with our values and our mission, we also intend to use $300,000 of the proceeds of this offering to partially fund Etsy.org, a Delaware non-profit organization that we formed in January 2015. Etsy.org will be dedicated to educating women and other under-represented entrepreneurial populations and empowering them to build businesses that regenerate communities and the planet. See \u0093Business\u0097Our Strategy: The Path Ahead\u0094 for additional information about Etsy.org. We may use a portion of the net proceeds to fund the build-out of our new corporate headquarters. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds received by us from this offering for acquisitions of other complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. However, we have no current understandings, agreements or commitments for any specific material acquisitions at this time. Except with respect to Etsy.org, we have not allocated specific amounts of the net proceeds received by us from this offering for any of these purposes and, as a result, we will have broad discretion in the allocation and use of the net proceeds. \n \n Pending our use of the net proceeds received by us from this offering, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short and intermediate term, interest-bearing obligations, investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. \n \n 48 \n \n Dividend Policy \n \n We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future decision to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws, and will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors thinks are relevant. Under Delaware law, we can only pay dividends either out of \u0093surplus\u0094 or out of the current or the immediately preceding year\u0092s net profits. Surplus is defined as the excess, if any, at any given time, of the total assets of a corporation over its total liabilities and statutory capital. As a result, we may not pay dividends according to our policy or at all if, among other things, we do not have sufficient cash to pay the intended dividends. Our future ability to pay cash dividends on our stock may be limited by the terms of any future debt or preferred securities and is limited by the terms of our Credit Agreement. See \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u0097Liquidity and Capital Resources\u0097Sources of Liquidity\u0094 for further information about our Credit Agreement. \n \n 49 \n \n Capitalization \n \n The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments and capitalization as of December 31, 2014: \n \n \u0095 on an actual basis; \n \n \u0095 on a pro forma basis to give effect to (i) the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into common stock and (ii) the effectiveness of the amendment and restatement of our certificate of incorporation in connection with the completion of this offering; and \n \n \u0095 on a pro forma as adjusted basis to give effect to the adjustments discussed above and the issuance and sale by us of shares of common stock in this offering, and the receipt of the net proceeds from our sale of these shares at an assumed initial public offering price of the common stock of $ per share, the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. \n \n The unaudited pro forma and pro forma as adjusted information below is illustrative only, and cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, total stockholders\u0092 equity and total capitalization after this offering will be adjusted based on the actual initial public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing. You should read this table in conjunction with \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u0094 and \u0093Description of Capital Stock\u0094 and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. \n \n 50 \n \n As of December 31, 2014 Actual Pro Forma Pro Forma \n \n as Adjusted(1) (unaudited) (in thousands, except share and per share data) Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments $ 88,843 $ $ Convertible preferred stock: Preferred stock, $0.001 par value; 21,165,473 shares authorized, 21,124,432 shares issued and outstanding, actual; shares authorized, no shares issued and outstanding, pro forma and pro forma as adjusted $ 80,212 $ $ Stockholders\u0092 equity: Common stock, $0.001 par value; 240,000,000 shares authorized, 88,361,973 shares issued and outstanding, actual; shares authorized, shares issued and outstanding, pro forma and shares issued and outstanding, pro forma as adjusted 88 Additional paid-in capital 103,311 Accumulated deficit (32,377) Accumulated other comprehensive loss (3,934) Total capitalization $ 147,300 $ $ \n \n (1) A $1.00 increase (or decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share would increase (or decrease) each of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, additional paid-in capital and total capitalization by $ million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions. If the underwriters\u0092 option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, additional paid-in capital and total capitalization would increase by approximately $ million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, and we would have shares of our common stock issued and outstanding. \n \n See \u0093Prospectus Summary\u0097The Offering\u0094 for a description of those shares that are or are not reflected as outstanding shares on a pro forma basis in the table above. \n \n 51 \n \n Dilution \n \n If you invest in our common stock, your investment will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the offering price per share of our common stock and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our common stock immediately after this offering. Dilution results from the fact that the per share offering price of our common stock is substantially higher than the book value per share attributable to our existing stockholders. \n \n Our pro forma net tangible book value as of was $ million, or $ per share of common stock. Our pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets reduced by the amount of our total liabilities and divided by the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding as of , after giving effect to the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into common stock in connection with this offering. \n \n After giving effect to our sale in this offering of shares of common stock at an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of would have been approximately $ million, or $ per share of common stock. This represents an immediate pro forma as adjusted dilution of $ per share to investors purchasing shares in this offering. \n \n The following table illustrates this per share dilution. \n \n Assumed initial offering price per share $ Pro forma net tangible book value per share as of $ Increase in pro forma net tangible book value per share attributable to investors purchasing shares in this offering $ Pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering Dilution per share to investors in this offering $ \n \n A $1.00 increase (or decrease) in the assumed offering price of $ per share would increase (or decrease) our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering by $ , assuming that the number of shares offered by us on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us. \n \n If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after giving effect to this offering would be approximately $ per share, and the dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share to investors in this offering would be approximately $ per share. \n \n The following table summarizes, as of , the differences between the number of outstanding shares of our common stock purchased from us, after giving effect to the conversion of our preferred stock into common stock, the total cash consideration paid and the average price per share paid by our existing \n \n 52 \n \n stockholders and by our new investors purchasing shares in this offering at the assumed offering price of the common stock of $ per share, the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, before deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us: \n \n Shares Purchased Total Consideration Average \n \n Price Per \n \n Share Number Percent Amount Percent Existing stockholders % $ % $ New investors Total 100 % $ 100 % $ \n \n Sales by the selling stockholders in this offering will cause the number of shares held by existing stockholders to be reduced to shares, or % of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding after this offering, and will increase the number of shares held by new investors to shares, or % of the total number of shares outstanding after this offering. \n \n A $1.00 increase (or decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $ per share would increase (or decrease) total consideration paid by new investors by $ million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us on the cover page of this prospectus remains the same, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us. \n \n After giving effect to the sale of shares in this offering by us and the selling stockholders, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, our existing stockholders would own % and our new investors would own % of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding after this offering. \n \n See \u0093Prospectus Summary\u0097The Offering\u0094 for a description of those shares that are or are not reflected in the foregoing tables or discussion. \n \n To the extent that any outstanding options or warrants are exercised, new investors will experience further dilution. \n \n 53 \n \n Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data \n \n The following tables show selected consolidated financial data. The selected consolidated statements of operations data for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, and the selected consolidated balance sheet data as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus.

Our historical results and key metrics are not necessarily indicative of future results, and results for any interim period presented below are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any annual period. Our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 have been revised to correct for the understatement of certain non-income tax related expenses.

We began tracking mobile visits and mobile GMS in 2013. \n \n Non-GAAP Financial Measures \n \n Adjusted EBITDA \n \n In this prospectus, we provide Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure that represents our net (loss) income before interest expense, net, (benefit) provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation expense, net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities, foreign exchange loss and acquisition-related expenses. Below is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. \n \n We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this prospectus because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans and assess the health of our business. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more in our platform. We believe \n \n 56 \n \n that Adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain non-cash items and certain variable charges. \n \n Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: \n \n \u0095 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \n \u0095 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of stock-based compensation expense or changes in the fair value of warrants; \n \n \u0095 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; \n \n \u0095 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect acquisition-related expenses; \n \n \u0095 Adjusted EBITDA does not consider the impact of foreign exchange loss; \n \n \u0095 Adjusted EBITDA, in future periods, will not reflect the impact of our contributions to Etsy.org; and \n \n \u0095 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \n \n Because of these limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net (loss) income and our other GAAP results. \n \n The following table reflects the reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated: \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 (in thousands) Net loss $ (2,385) $ (796) $ (15,243) Excluding: Interest expense, net 438 256 549 (Benefit) provision for income taxes (145) 854 4,983 Depreciation and amortization 7,930 12,380 17,223 Stock-based compensation expense 4,094 3,834 5,920 Stock-based compensation expense\u0097acquisitions \u0097 \u0097 4,130 Net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities 737 419 411 Foreign exchange loss \u0097 \u0097 3,049 Acquisition-related expenses \u0097 \u0097 2,059 Adjusted EBITDA $ 10,669 $ 16,947 $ 23,081 \n \n 57 \n \n Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial \n \n Condition and Results of Operations \n \n You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and our performance and future success, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the \u0093Risk Factors\u0094 section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. \n \n Overview \n \n We operate a marketplace where people around the world connect, both online and offline, to make, sell and buy unique goods. Handmade goods are the foundation of our marketplace. Whether crafted by an Etsy seller herself, with the assistance of her team or with an outside manufacturer in small batches, handmade goods spring from the imagination and creativity of an Etsy seller and embody authorship, responsibility and transparency. We believe we are creating a new economy, which we call the Etsy Economy, where creative entrepreneurs find meaningful work and both global and local markets for their goods, and where thoughtful consumers discover and buy unique goods and build relationships with the people who sell them. \n \n Etsy was founded in June 2005 in Brooklyn, New York as a marketplace for handmade goods and craft supplies. From those beginnings, we have built an innovative, technology-based platform that, as of December 31, 2014, connected 54.0 million members, including 1.4 million active sellers and 19.8 million active buyers, in nearly every country in the world. In 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion, of which 36.1% came from purchases made on mobile devices and 30.9% came from an Etsy seller or an Etsy buyer outside of the United States. \n \n Our business has grown in significant ways: \n \n \u0095 Our GMS was $1.35 billion in 2013, up 50.6% over 2012, and was $1.93 billion in 2014, up 43.3% over 2013. \n \n \u0095 Our revenue was $125.0 million in 2013, up 67.6% over 2012. In 2013, our Marketplace revenue was $78.5 million, up 42.0% over 2012, and our Seller Services revenue was $42.8 million, up 169.9% over 2012. Our revenue was $195.6 million in 2014, up 56.4% over 2013. In 2014, our Marketplace revenue was $108.7 million, up 38.4% over 2013, and our Seller Services revenue was $82.5 million, up 92.7% over 2013. \n \n 58 \n \n \u0095 As of December 31, 2013, our number of active sellers was 1.1 million, up 29.4% since December 31, 2012, and our number of active buyers was 14.0 million, up 50.6% since December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2014, our number of active sellers was 1.4 million, up 26.0% since December 31, 2013, and our number of active buyers was 19.8 million, up 41.2% since December 31, 2013. \n \n \u0095 Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers have transacted across borders since our first year of business, and our international community continues to grow. International GMS was 28.4% of GMS in 2013 and was 30.9% of GMS in 2014. Currently, Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are based in nearly every country in the world and our marketplace is available in 10 languages. \n \n \u0095 We launched our first mobile app in 2011, and we continue to enhance our mobile offerings. Mobile visits represented 41.3% of visits in 2013 and 53.2% of visits in 2014. Mobile GMS represented 29.5% of GMS in 2013 and 36.1% of GMS in 2014. \n \n \u0095 We have continued to expand our Seller Services. We launched Promoted Listings in 2011, followed by Direct Checkout in 2012, Shipping Labels in 2013 and Wholesale in 2014. \n \n We operate a platform for third-party sellers. Our business model is based on shared success: we make money when Etsy sellers make money. We do not compete with Etsy sellers, hold inventory or sell goods. Our revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services we provide Etsy sellers to help them create and grow their businesses. Marketplace revenue includes the fee an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and the listing fee an Etsy seller pays for each item she lists. Seller Services revenue includes fees an Etsy seller pays for services such as prominent placement in search results via Promoted Listings, payment processing via Direct Checkout and purchases of shipping labels through our platform via Shipping Labels. Other revenue includes the fees we receive from a third-party payment processor. \n \n In 2013, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.35 billion, up 50.6% over 2012, and in 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion, up 43.3% over 2013. In 2013, we generated revenue of $125.0 million, up 67.6% over 2012, and in 2014, we generated revenue of $195.6 million, up 56.4% over 2013. In 2013, we generated a net loss of $0.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $16.9 million compared to a net loss of $2.4 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $10.7 million in 2012. In 2014, we generated a net loss of $15.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $23.1 million compared to a net loss of $0.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $16.9 million in 2013. See \u0093Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u0097Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u0094 for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. \n \n The consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 have been revised to correct for the understatement of certain non-income tax-related expenses. See Note 15 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. \n \n 59 \n \n Key Operating and Financial Metrics \n \n We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our ecosystem, allocate our resources (such as capital, time and technology investments) and assess the performance of our business. In addition to revenue, net (loss) income and other results under GAAP, the key operating and financial metrics we use are: \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 (in thousands, except percentages) GMS $ 895,152 $ 1,347,833 $ 1,931,981 Adjusted EBITDA $ 10,669 $ 16,947 $ 23,081 Active sellers 830 1,074 1,353 Active buyers 9,317 14,032 19,810 Percent mobile visits N/A 41.3 % 53.2 % Percent mobile GMS N/A 29.5 % 36.1 % Percent international GMS 28.4 % 28.4 % 30.9 % \n \n GMS \n \n Gross merchandise sales, or GMS, is the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace within the applicable period, excluding shipping fees and net of refunds associated with cancelled transactions. GMS does not represent revenue earned by us. GMS relates only to Marketplace activity and does not reflect Seller Services activity. However, because our revenue and cost of revenue depend significantly on the dollar value of items sold in our marketplace, we believe that GMS is an indicator of the success of Etsy sellers, the satisfaction of Etsy buyers, the health of our ecosystem and the scale and growth of our business. \n \n Adjusted EBITDA \n \n Adjusted EBITDA represents our net (loss) income before interest expense, net, (benefit) provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization, adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation expense, net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities, foreign exchange loss and acquisition-related expenses. In future periods, we intend to exclude the impact of our contributions to Etsy.org from Adjusted EBITDA. We have included Adjusted EBITDA in this prospectus because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends, allocate internal resources, prepare and approve our annual budget, develop short- and long-term operating plans and assess the health of our ecosystem. As our Adjusted EBITDA increases, we are able to invest more resources in our community. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of non-cash items and certain variable charges. See \u0093Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u0097Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u0094 for information regarding the limitations of using Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. \n \n 60 \n \n Active Sellers \n \n An active seller is an Etsy seller who has incurred at least one charge from us in the last 12 months. Charges include transaction fees, listing fees and fees for Direct Checkout, Promoted Listings, Shipping Labels and Wholesale enrollment. An Etsy seller is a member who has created an account and has listed an item in our marketplace. An Etsy seller is identified by a unique e-mail address; a single person can have multiple Etsy seller accounts. We succeed when Etsy sellers succeed, so we view the number of active sellers as a key indicator of the awareness of our brand, the reach of our platform, the potential for growth in GMS and revenue and the health of our ecosystem. \n \n Active Buyers \n \n An active buyer is an Etsy buyer who has made at least one purchase in the last 12 months. An Etsy buyer is a member who has created an account in our marketplace. An Etsy buyer is identified by a unique e-mail address; a single person can have multiple Etsy buyer accounts. We succeed when Etsy buyers order items from Etsy sellers, so we view the number of active buyers as a key indicator of our potential for growth in GMS and revenue, the reach of our platform, awareness of our brand, the engagement and loyalty of Etsy buyers and the health of our ecosystem. \n \n Mobile Visits \n \n A mobile visit is a visit that occurs on a mobile device, such as a tablet or a smartphone. Etsy sellers are increasingly using mobile devices to manage their listings and track their business performance on our platform. In addition, Etsy buyers increasingly use mobile devices to search, browse and purchase items on our platform. We began tracking mobile visits in 2013. We view percent mobile visits as a key indicator of the level of engagement of our members on our mobile website and mobile apps and of our ability to sustain GMS and revenue. \n \n Mobile GMS \n \n Mobile GMS is GMS that occurs on a mobile device, such as a tablet or a smartphone. Mobile GMS excludes orders initiated on mobile devices but ultimately completed on a desktop. We began tracking mobile GMS in 2013. We believe that mobile GMS indicates our success in converting mobile activity into mobile purchases and demonstrates our ability to grow GMS and revenue. \n \n International GMS \n \n International GMS is GMS from transactions where either the billing address for the Etsy seller or the shipping address for the Etsy buyer at the time of sale is outside of the United States. We believe that international GMS shows the level of engagement of our community outside the United States and demonstrates our ability to grow GMS and revenue. \n \n 61 \n \n Key Factors Affecting Our Performance \n \n We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and in the section titled \u0093Risk Factors.\u0094 \n \n Growth and Retention of Active Sellers and Active Buyers \n \n Our success depends in part on the growth and retention of our active sellers and active buyers. Our revenue is driven by the number of active sellers, seller engagement, the number of active buyers, buyer engagement and our ability to maintain an authentic, trusted marketplace. As of December 31, 2014, our marketplace had grown to 1.4 million active sellers and 19.8 million active buyers, up from 1.1 million active sellers and 14.0 million active buyers as of December 31, 2013. Failure to effectively attract and retain new active sellers and active buyers, to re-engage inactive sellers and inactive buyers and to engage active sellers and active buyers on a cost-effective basis would adversely affect our revenue growth, operating results and the overall health of our ecosystem. \n \n To analyze our retention rates, we measure repeat activity by our members. \n \n Cohort of 2011 Active Sellers \n \n We refer to active sellers as of December 31, 2011 as \u00932011 Active Sellers.\u0094 Fifty-three percent of 2011 Active Sellers remained active sellers as of December 31, 2012, 39% of 2011 Active Sellers remained active sellers as of December 31, 2013 and 32% of 2011 Active Sellers remained active sellers as of December 31, 2014. The average annual GMS per 2011 Active Seller in 2012 was nearly three times higher than in 2011, the average annual GMS per 2011 Active Seller in 2013 was four times higher than in 2011 and the average annual GMS per 2011 Active Seller in 2014 was five times higher than in 2011. \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2011 2012 2013 2014 Percent 2011 Active Sellers 100 % 52.6 % 39.3 % 32.3 % Average GMS per 2011 Active Seller $ 817 $ 2,241 $ 3,314 $ 4,299 \n \n Cohort of 2011 Active Buyers \n \n We refer to active buyers as of December 31, 2011 as \u00932011 Active Buyers.\u0094 Forty-six percent of 2011 Active Buyers remained active buyers as of December 31, 2012, 45% of 2011 Active Buyers remained active buyers as of December 31, 2013 and 45% of 2011 Active Buyers remained active buyers as of December 31, 2014. The average annual GMS per 2011 Active Buyer in 2012 was 72% higher than in 2011, the average annual GMS per 2011 Active Buyer in 2013 was 81% higher than in 2011 and the average annual GMS per 2011 Active Buyer in 2014 was 89% higher than in 2011. \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2011 2012 2013 2014 Percent 2011 Active Buyers 100 % 46.2 % 44.7 % 44.7 % Average GMS per 2011 Active Buyer $ 103 $ 177 $ 186 $ 195 \n \n 62 \n \n High-Impact Seller Services Growth \n \n Our business model is based on shared success: we make money when Etsy sellers make money. Because of this, we provide services to an Etsy seller to help her start and grow her shop. As of December 31, 2014, 18.2% of active sellers used Promoted Listings, 36.1% of active sellers used Direct Checkout and 21.4% of active sellers in the United States and Canada used Shipping Labels. Our effectiveness in increasing the uptake of our Seller Services, enhancing existing Seller Services and extending their geographic reach and introducing new Seller Services will directly impact the success of Etsy sellers, our revenue growth and our operating results. \n \n International Growth \n \n Our growth will depend in part on international Etsy sellers and international Etsy buyers constituting an increasing portion of our community. International GMS was 28.4% of GMS in 2013 compared to 30.9% in 2014. Currently, Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are based in nearly every country in the world, and our marketplace is available in 10 languages. Although we promote cross-border transactions, our strategy is to build and deepen local Etsy communities around the world, each with its own ecosystem of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. To meet this goal, we plan to invest in local marketing and content and local payment and shipping solutions. An inability to develop these Etsy communities or to otherwise grow our business outside the United States on a cost-effective basis could adversely affect our GMS, revenue and other operating results. \n \n Mobile Growth \n \n We believe continued enhancement of the mobile features of our platform will be critical to attracting and retaining Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers and maintaining the vibrancy of our marketplace. The success of this effort will be increasingly important as shopping on mobile devices displaces shopping on desktops and as Etsy sellers increasingly seek to run their shops via mobile devices. \n \n We launched our first mobile app in 2011 and since then have expanded our mobile offerings for both Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. Our \u0093Sell on Etsy\u0094 mobile app, which we launched in April 2014, is designed to help an Etsy seller operate her shop, manage orders and access resources. Our Etsy buyer apps and mobile web experience include features designed to keep Etsy buyers engaged and offer an improved shopping experience. As of December 31, 2014, our mobile apps have been downloaded 21.8 million times, and mobile visits represented 53.2% of visits in 2014. In addition, in the same period, mobile GMS was 36.1% of GMS. If we are unable to continue to engage Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers through our mobile offerings, then our GMS and revenue growth and other operating results could be adversely affected. \n \n Investment in Marketing \n \n To date, we have grown largely due to strong brand awareness and word-of-mouth referrals, with the majority of our visits coming from direct and organic channels. In 2013, we spent $17.9 million on marketing expenses, or 14.3% of revenue, compared with 14.6% of revenue in 2012. However, in 2014, we began \n \n 63 \n \n increasing our brand and digital marketing efforts. In 2014, we spent $39.7 million on marketing expenses, or 20.3% of revenue, up 122.2% over 2013. Our growth will depend in part on our continued ability to launch marketing campaigns that resonate with new and existing members and appropriately balance our level of marketing spending with the benefits that may be realized through member and revenue growth. \n \n Investment in Growth \n \n We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in our platform to attract members and enhance the member experience. In 2013, we spent $27.5 million on product development expenses, or 22.0% of revenue, up 47.7% over 2012, and in 2014, we spent $36.6 million on product development expenses, or 18.7% of revenue, up 33.0% over 2013. We have invested significant resources in our technology platform and infrastructure to date and plan to continue to invest in innovation to address the needs of our members. We also plan to hire additional personnel to address the needs of our community. As part of this growth in headcount, we signed a lease in May 2014 for a new headquarters facility to accommodate our anticipated growth in personnel. The investments we make in our platform are all designed to grow our ecosystem and revenue and to improve our operating results in the long term, but these investments could also delay our ability to achieve profitability or reduce our profitability in the near term. \n \n Components of Our Results of Operations \n \n Revenue \n \n Our revenue consists of Marketplace revenue, Seller Services revenue and Other revenue. \n \n Marketplace revenue. Marketplace revenue consists of the 3.5% fee that an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction on our platform, exclusive of shipping fees charged. Marketplace revenue also consists of a listing fee of $0.20 per item that she lists (for up to four months) in our marketplace. Although revenue from completed Wholesale transactions is included in Marketplace revenue, revenue from Wholesale enrollment is included in Seller Services revenue. \n \n Seller Services revenue. Seller Services revenue consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us for the Seller Services she uses, including Promoted Listings, Direct Checkout, Shipping Labels and Wholesale. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Promoted Listings consists of cost-per-click based fees an Etsy seller pays us for prominent placement of her listings in search results generated by Etsy buyers in our marketplace. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Direct Checkout consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us to process credit, debit and Etsy Gift Card payments. Direct Checkout fees vary between 3\u00964% of the item\u0092s total sale price plus a flat fee per order, depending on the country in which her bank account is located. Direct Checkout fees are taken from the item\u0092s total sale price, including shipping. \n \n 64 \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Shipping Labels consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us when she purchases shipping labels through our platform, net of the cost we incur in purchasing those shipping labels. We are able to provide our sellers shipping labels from the United States Postal Service and Canada Post at discounted pricing due to the volume of purchases through our platform. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Wholesale consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us when she is approved to enroll in our Wholesale program. \n \n Other revenue. Other revenue includes the fees we receive from a third-party payment processor. \n \n Our revenue recognition policies are discussed under \u0093\u0097Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates.\u0094 \n \n Cost of Revenue \n \n Cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of our platform and data centers, including depreciation and amortization, employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes the cost of interchange and other fees for credit card processing services, credit card verification service fees and credit card chargebacks to support Direct Checkout revenue, as well as employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our member support staff, and costs of refunds made to Etsy buyers that we are not able to collect from Etsy sellers. Our cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may change over time as our revenue mix changes; for example, to the extent that Direct Checkout revenue increases as a percentage of revenue, there may be a dampening effect on our gross margin. \n \n Operating Expenses \n \n Operating expenses consist of marketing, product development and general and administrative expenses. Direct and indirect employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, are the most significant component of the product development and general and administrative expense categories, and we expect these costs to increase as we continue to hire new employees in order to support our anticipated growth. We include stock-based compensation expense in connection with the grant of stock options in the applicable operating expense category based on the respective equity award recipient\u0092s function. \n \n Marketing. Marketing expenses consist primarily of targeted online marketing costs, such as search engine marketing and, to a much lesser extent, offline marketing expenses, such as television advertising. Marketing expenses also include employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our employees involved in marketing, public relations and communications activities. Marketing expenses are primarily driven by investments to grow and retain members on our platform. \n \n Product development. Product development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our employees involved in product development activities. Additional expenses include consulting costs related to the development, quality assurance and testing of new technology and enhancement of our existing technology. \n \n 65 \n \n General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the use of facilities and equipment, including depreciation and amortization, rent, and certain professional services expenses. General and administrative expenses also include employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our employees involved in general corporate functions and currency gains or losses. General and administrative expenses are primarily driven by increases in headcount required to support business growth, and, to a lesser extent in the near term, will be driven by expenses incurred to make the transition to being a public company. \n \n Other Expense, net \n \n Other expense, net consists of interest expense, interest income, foreign exchange loss and net unrealized loss on warrant and other liabilities. \n \n 66 \n \n Results of Operations \n \n The following tables show our results of operations for the periods presented and express the relationship of certain line items as a percentage of revenue for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results. \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 (in thousands) Revenue: Marketplace $ 55,330 $ 78,544 $ 108,732 Seller Services 15,863 42,817 82,502 Other 3,409 3,661 4,357 Total revenue 74,602 125,022 195,591 Cost of revenue 24,493 47,779 73,633 Gross profit 50,109 77,243 121,958 Operating expenses: Marketing 10,902 17,850 39,655 Product development 18,653 27,548 36,634 General and administrative 21,909 31,112 51,920 Total operating expenses 51,464 76,510 128,209 (Loss) income from operations (1,355) 733 (6,251) Other expense, net (1,175) (675) (4,009) (Loss) income before income taxes (2,530) 58 (10,260) Benefit (provision) for income taxes 145 (854) (4,983) Net loss $ (2,385) $ (796) $ (15,243) Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Revenue: Marketplace 74.2% 62.8% 55.6% Seller Services 21.3 34.2 42.2 Other 4.6 2.9 2.2 Total revenue 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of revenue 32.8 38.2 37.6 Gross profit 67.2 61.8 62.4 Operating expenses: Marketing 14.6 14.3 20.3 Product development 25.0 22.0 18.7 General and administrative 29.4 24.9 26.5 Total operating expenses 69.0 61.2 65.5 (Loss) income from operations (1.8) 0.6 (3.2) Other expense, net (1.6) (0.5) (2.0) (Loss) income before income taxes (3.4) 0.0 (5.2) Benefit (provision) for income taxes 0.2 (0.7) (2.5) Net loss (3.2) (0.6) (7.8) \n \n 67 \n \n Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 \n \n Revenue \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Revenue: Marketplace $ 78,544 $ 108,732 $ 30,188 38.4 % Percentage of total revenue 62.8 % 55.6 % Seller Services $ 42,817 $ 82,502 $ 39,685 92.7 % Percentage of total revenue 34.2 % 42.2 % Other $ 3,661 $ 4,357 $ 696 19.0 % Percentage of total revenue 2.9 % 2.2 % Total revenue $ 125,022 $ 195,591 $ 70,569 56.4 % \n \n Revenue increased $70.6 million, or 56.4%, to $195.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013, of which 55.6% consisted of Marketplace revenue and 42.2% consisted of Seller Services revenue. \n \n Marketplace revenue increased $30.2 million, or 38.4%, to $108.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013. This growth corresponded with a 43.3% increase in GMS to a total of $1.93 billion for 2014. As our GMS increased, our Marketplace revenue increased, primarily as a result of an increase in the amount of transaction fees received and an increase in listings from new and existing Etsy sellers with a corresponding increase in listing fees received. During 2014, international GMS increased as a percentage of total GMS to 30.9%, up from 28.4% for 2013. During 2014, mobile GMS increased as a percentage of total GMS to 36.1%, up from 29.5% for 2013. Active sellers increased 26.0% to 1.4 million and active buyers increased 41.2% to 19.8 million for 2014 compared to 2013. \n \n Seller Services revenue increased $39.7 million, or 92.7%, to $82.5 million in 2014 compared to 2013. The growth in Seller Services revenue was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from Direct Checkout services, as well as increases in Promoted Listings and Shipping Labels. The increase in Direct Checkout services revenue reflects continued increases in U.S. Direct Checkout revenue, as well as growth in international Direct Checkout services as those services were initiated in the second quarter of 2013. As of December 31, 2014, we offered Direct Checkout in 10 currencies, including the U.S. dollar. The increase in Promoted Listings revenue reflects enhancements made to the service in 2014. The increase in Shipping Label revenue reflects an increase in the number of Etsy sellers using the service and, to a lesser extent, the introduction of Shipping Labels in Canada in 2014. \n \n Other revenue increased $0.7 million, or 19.0%, to $4.4 million in 2014 compared to 2013. Other revenue decreased as a percentage of total revenue, however, as Etsy buyers opted to use Direct Checkout for their purchases rather than a third-party payment processor. \n \n 68 \n \n Cost of Revenue \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Cost of revenue $ 47,779 $ 73,633 $ 25,854 54.1 % Percentage of total revenue 38.2 % 37.6 % \n \n Cost of revenue increased $25.9 million, or 54.1%, to $73.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in the cost of supporting Direct Checkout revenue due to the introduction of international Direct Checkout as well as growth in the U.S. Direct Checkout revenue. To a lesser extent, the increase was due to an increase in depreciation and amortization for ongoing maintenance of our technology infrastructure and an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our member support and technical operations teams. \n \n Operating Expenses \n \n Marketing \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Marketing $ 17,850 $ 39,655 $ 21,805 122.2 % Percentage of total revenue 14.3 % 20.3 % \n \n Marketing expenses increased $21.8 million, or 122.2%, to $39.7 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in search engine marketing from Google product listing ads and, to a lesser extent, from an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our marketing team, which includes our public relations and communications teams. \n \n Product development \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Product development $ 27,548 $ 36,634 $ 9,086 33.0 % Percentage of total revenue 22.0 % 18.7 % \n \n Product development expenses increased $9.1 million, or 33.0%, to $36.6 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our product and engineering teams. \n \n 69 \n \n General and administrative \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) General and administrative $ 31,112 $ 51,920 $ 20,808 66.9 % Percentage of total revenue 24.9 % 26.5 % \n \n General and administrative expenses increased $20.8 million, or 66.9%, to $51.9 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of an increase in employee-related costs from headcount growth in general corporate functions and from building out the executive management team and, to a lesser extent, due to increased legal and accounting fees. \n \n Other Expense, net \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Other expense, net $ (675) $ (4,009) $ (3,334) 493.9 % Percentage of total revenue (0.5)% (2.0)% \n \n Other expense, net increased $3.3 million, or 493.9%, to $4.0 million in 2014 compared to 2013, primarily as a result of the foreign exchange loss. \n \n Provision for Income Taxes \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2013 2014 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Provision for income taxes $ (854 ) $ (4,983) $ (4,129) NM Percentage of total revenue (0.7 )% (2.5)% \n \n Our effective tax rate fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, the amount of stock-based compensation expense and net unrealized loss on warrants, the impact of acquisitions, the change resulting from the amount of recorded valuation allowance, the permanent difference between GAAP and local tax laws and certain one-time items such as tax rate changes. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we determined that the existence of a three-year cumulative loss in a foreign jurisdiction was sufficient negative evidence to warrant the establishment of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in that jurisdiction. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance against certain of our deferred tax assets of $0 as of December 31, 2013 and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2014. \n \n 70 \n \n Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 \n \n Revenue \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2012 2013 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Revenue: Marketplace $ 55,330 $ 78,544 $ 23,214 42.0 % Percentage of total revenue 74.2 % 62.8 % Seller Services $ 15,863 $ 42,817 $ 26,954 169.9 % Percentage of total revenue 21.3 % 34.2 % Other $ 3,409 $ 3,661 $ 252 7.4 % Percentage of total revenue 4.6 % 2.9 % Total revenue $ 74,602 $ 125,022 $ 50,420 67.6 % \n \n Revenue increased $50.4 million, or 67.6%, to $125.0 million in 2013 compared to 2012, of which 62.8% consisted of Marketplace revenue and 34.2% consisted of Seller Services revenue. \n \n Marketplace revenue increased $23.2 million, or 42.0%, to $78.5 million in 2013 compared to 2012. This growth corresponded with a 50.6% increase in GMS to a total of $1.35 billion for 2013. As our GMS increased, our Marketplace revenue increased, primarily as a result of an increase in the amount of transaction fees received and an increase in listings from new and existing Etsy sellers with a corresponding increase in listing fees received. During 2013, international GMS as a percentage of total GMS was 28.4%, and mobile GMS as a percentage of total GMS was 29.5%. Active sellers increased 29.4% to 1.1 million and active buyers increased 50.6% to 14.0 million for 2013 compared to 2012. \n \n Seller Services revenue increased $27.0 million, or 169.9%, to $42.8 million in 2013 compared to 2012. The growth in Seller Services revenue was primarily driven by an increase in revenue from Direct Checkout services, as well as increases in Promoted Listings and Shipping Labels. The increase in Direct Checkout services revenue reflects a full year of U.S. Direct Checkout revenue, as the service was first introduced in the United States in the second quarter of 2012, as well as the introduction of international Direct Checkout services starting in the second half of 2013. As of the end of 2013, we offered Direct Checkout in 10 currencies, including the U.S. dollar. The increase in Promoted Listings revenue and the increase in Shipping Label revenue reflect an increase in the number of Etsy sellers using these services. \n \n Other revenue increased $0.3 million, or 7.4%, to $3.7 million in 2013 compared to 2012. Other revenue decreased as a percentage of revenue, however, as Etsy buyers opted to use Direct Checkout for their purchases rather than a third-party payment processor. \n \n 71 \n \n Cost of Revenue \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2012 2013 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Cost of revenue $ 24,493 $ 47,779 $ 23,286 95.1 % Percentage of total revenue 32.8 % 38.2 % \n \n Cost of revenue increased $23.3 million, or 95.1%, to $47.8 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily as a result of an increase in the cost of supporting Direct Checkout revenue due to the introduction of international Direct Checkout as well as growth in the U.S. Direct Checkout revenue. To a lesser extent, the increase was due to an increase in depreciation and amortization for ongoing maintenance of our technology infrastructure and an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our member support and technical operations teams. \n \n Operating Expenses \n \n Marketing \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2012 2013 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Marketing $ 10,902 $ 17,850 $ 6,948 63.7 % Percentage of total revenue 14.6 % 14.3 % \n \n Marketing expenses increased $6.9 million, or 63.7%, to $17.9 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily as a result of an increase in search engine marketing from Google product listing ads and, to a lesser extent, from an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our marketing team, which includes our public relations and communications teams. \n \n Product development \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2012 2013 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Product development $ 18,653 $ 27,548 $ 8,895 47.7 % Percentage of total revenue 25.0 % 22.0 % \n \n Product development expenses increased $8.9 million, or 47.7%, to $27.5 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily as a result of an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our product and engineering teams. \n \n 72 \n \n General and administrative \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2012 2013 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) General and administrative $ 21,909 $ 31,112 $ 9,203 42.0 % Percentage of total revenue 29.4 % 24.9 % \n \n General and administrative expenses increased $9.2 million, or 42.0%, to $31.1 million in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily as a result of an increase in employee-related costs from headcount growth in general corporate functions and from building out the executive management team. \n \n Other Expense, net \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2012 2013 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Other expense, net $ (1,175) $ (675) $ 500 42.6% Percentage of total revenue (1.6)% (0.5)% \n \n Other expense, net decreased primarily as a result of a smaller unrealized loss in 2013 for our warrant liability and lower interest expense. \n \n Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Change 2012 2013 $ % (in thousands, except percentages) Benefit (provision) for income taxes $ 145 $ (854) $ (999) NM Percentage of total revenue 0.2 % (0.7 )% \n \n Our effective tax rate fluctuates from period to period due to changes in the mix of income and losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, the amount of stock-based compensation expense and net unrealized loss on warrants, the impact of acquisitions, the change resulting from the amount of recorded valuation allowance, the permanent difference between GAAP and local tax laws and certain one-time items such as tax rate changes. \n \n Quarterly Results of Operations \n \n The following tables show selected unaudited quarterly results of operations and other operational and non-GAAP financial data for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2014, as well as the percentage that each line item in the following results of operations data represents of revenue. The results of operations data for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus and includes all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of our results of operations for these periods. The results of operations data for the three months ended March 31, 2013, the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, \n \n 73 \n \n the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, the three months ended December 31, 2013 and the three months ended September 30, 2014 have been revised and the three months ended March 31, 2014, the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014 have been restated to correct for the understatement of certain non-income tax-related expenses and the misstatement of expenses due to period-end cutoff errors. See Note 16 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. This data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. Our quarterly results of operations and operational and non-GAAP financial data will vary in the future.

\n \n Etsy sellers experience increased sales and use more Seller Services during the fourth-quarter holiday shopping season. This has resulted in increased revenue for us during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, which can compare to lower revenue in the first quarter of the following fiscal year. For example, revenue in the first quarter of 2014 decreased slightly when compared with revenue in the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect this seasonality to continue in future years. Our operating (loss) income has also been affected by these historical trends because many of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term. As our growth rates begin to moderate, the impact of these seasonality trends on our results of operations may become more pronounced. \n \n Our quarterly revenue increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter for all periods presented above, other than the first quarter of 2014, corresponding to our GMS performance in the same periods. We cannot assure you that this pattern of sequential revenue growth will continue. We believe that it is generally more meaningful to compare year-over-year results than sequential quarter-over-quarter results. \n \n Our quarterly cost of revenue increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter for substantially all periods presented above, primarily due to increases in visits and to increased usage of Direct Checkout during the period and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our member support and technical operations teams. \n \n Marketing expenses increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter for substantially all periods presented above, and significantly increased beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, primarily due to increased marketing \n \n 76 \n \n programs to attract and retain new Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers on our platform and, to a lesser extent, to an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our marketing team, which includes our public relations and communications teams. \n \n Product development expenses generally remained consistent or increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter for the periods presented above, primarily as a result of an increase in employee-related costs resulting from increased headcount in our product and engineering teams. \n \n General and administrative expenses increased sequentially quarter-to-quarter for substantially all periods presented above, primarily as a result of an increase in employee-related costs from headcount growth in general corporate functions and from building out the executive management team. \n \n Our business is directly affected by the behavior of consumers. Economic conditions and competitive pressures can significantly impact, both positively and negatively, the level of demand by Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers on our platform. Consequently, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance. \n \n Liquidity and Capital Resources \n \n The following tables show our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and working capital as of the dates indicated: \n \n As of \n \n December 31, 2013 2014 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 36,795 $ 69,659 Short-term investments 18,075 19,184 Accounts receivable, net 11,102 15,404 Working capital 57,566 88,540 \n \n As of December 31, 2014, our cash and cash equivalents, a majority of which were held in cash deposits and money market funds, were held for working capital purposes. We intend to increase our capital expenditures to support the growth in our business and operations, and intend to invest approximately $50.0 million through the middle of 2016 to build out our new Brooklyn, New York headquarters. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, together with cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. We may seek to borrow funds under our Credit Agreement or raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those described in the section of this prospectus captioned \u0093Risk Factors.\u0094 We may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on acceptable terms, or at all. \n \n 77 \n \n Sources of Liquidity \n \n Since our inception, we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flows generated by operations and through non-registered sales of preferred stock and common stock. Since inception and as of December 31, 2014, we have raised a total of $125.6 million from the sale of preferred stock and common stock (including proceeds from the exercise of stock options), net of costs and expenses associated with such financings and net of repurchases of $0.5 million of capital stock. \n \n Credit Facility \n \n In May 2014, we entered into a $35.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a Revolving Credit and Guaranty Agreement with several lenders, or the Credit Agreement. In March 2015, we amended the Credit Agreement to increase the credit facility to $50.0 million. As amended, the Credit Agreement will mature in May 2019. The amended Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit of $10.0 million and a swingline loan sublimit of $15.0 million. \n \n Borrowings under the amended Credit Agreement (other than swingline loans) bear interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, in each case plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.25% or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.25%. Swingline loans under the amended Credit Agreement bear interest at the same base rate (plus the margin applicable to borrowings bearing interest at the base rate). These margins are determined based on the total leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarters. We are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an unused commitment fee and fees associated with letters of credit. As amended, the Credit Agreement also permits us, in certain circumstances, to request an increase in the facility by an additional amount of up to $50.0 million (and in minimum amounts of $10.0 million) at the same maturity, pricing and other terms. \n \n The amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties applicable to us and our subsidiaries and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and our restricted subsidiaries. The negative covenants include restrictions on, among other things, indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, transactions with affiliates and dividends and other distributions. These restrictions do not prohibit any of our subsidiaries from making pro rata payments to us or any other person that owns an equity interest in any such subsidiary. The amended Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a total leverage ratio (defined as net debt to adjusted EBITDA) not to exceed 3.50 to 1.00. \n \n As amended, the Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including a change in control and a cross-default on our material indebtedness. Our obligations under the amended Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries\u0092 assets, and our obligations under the amended Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. \n \n As of March 4, 2015, no amounts have been drawn under the credit facility. In January 2015, we implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align our structure with our global operations \n \n 78 \n \n and future expansion plans outside the United States. The amendment to the Credit Agreement includes a waiver with respect to our compliance with certain restrictions in the Credit Agreement, to the extent that actions taken to implement our revised corporate structure could be construed as breaches or defaults under the Credit Agreement. \n \n Historical Cash Flows \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 (in thousands) Cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ 9,684 $ 16,542 $ 12,087 Investing activities (28,877 ) (15,025 ) (20,723 ) Financing activities 42,972 (103 ) 45,237 \n \n Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities \n \n Our cash flows from operations are largely dependent on the amount of revenue generated on our platform. Net cash provided by operating activities in each period presented has been influenced by changes in accounts receivable, funds receivable and customer accounts, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and funds payable and amounts due to customers. \n \n Net cash provided by operating activities was $12.1 million in 2014, as a result of net loss of $15.2 million, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and other non-cash charges of $27.1 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities that provided $0.3 million in cash. \n \n Net cash provided by operating activities was $16.5 million in 2013, as a result of net loss of $0.8 million, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and other non-cash charges of $19.6 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities that used $2.2 million in cash. \n \n Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.7 million in 2012 as a result of net loss of $2.4 million, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense and other non-cash charges of $13.5 million and changes in our operating assets and liabilities that used $1.4 million in cash. \n \n Net Cash Used in Investing Activities \n \n Our primary investing activities have consisted of capital expenditures, including investments in website development and internal-use software and purchases of property and equipment to support our overall business growth. Investments in website development and internal-use software and purchases of property and equipment may vary from period to period due to timing of the expansion of our operations. Additionally, we have invested some of our excess cash balances in U.S. Government and agency bills. \n \n Net cash used in investing activities was $20.7 million in 2014. This was primarily attributable to $5.3 million in restricted cash associated with the lease of our new Brooklyn, New York headquarters, $4.7 million in cash paid to acquire businesses, capital expenditures, including $8.3 million for website development and internal-use software and $1.3 million for purchases of property and equipment, and net purchases of marketable securities of $1.1 million. \n \n 79 \n \n Net cash used in investing activities was $15.0 million in 2013. This was primarily attributable to capital expenditures, including $9.3 million for website development and internal-use software and $7.8 million for purchases of property and equipment, offset by sales of marketable securities of $2.8 million. \n \n Net cash used in investing activities was $28.9 million in 2012. This was primarily attributable to purchases of U.S. Government and agency bills of $16.1 million as well as capital expenditures, including $7.4 million for website development and internal-use software and $6.5 million for purchases of property and equipment, offset by sales of marketable securities of $1.4 million. \n \n Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities \n \n Net cash provided by financing activities was $45.2 million in 2014. This was primarily attributable to net proceeds from a common stock financing of $35.0 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $8.0 million and the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options of $4.9 million, offset by payments related to our public offering of $1.0 million and payments on capitalized lease obligations of $1.5 million. \n \n Net cash used in financing activities was $0.1 million in 2013. This was primarily attributable to payments on capitalized lease obligations of $1.3 million, offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $1.3 million. \n \n Net cash provided by financing activities was $43.0 million in 2012. This was primarily attributable to net proceeds from a preferred stock financing of $39.8 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $4.6 million, offset by payments on capitalized lease obligations of $1.4 million. \n \n Off Balance Sheet Arrangements \n \n We did not have any off balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K, in 2012, 2013 or 2014. \n \n Contractual Obligations \n \n The following table summarizes our future fixed contractual obligations as of December 31, 2014 (in thousands): \n \n Total Less than 1 \n \n Year 1\u00963 \n \n Years 3\u00965 \n \n Years More than \n \n 5 Years Capital lease obligations $ 4,903 $ 1,755 $ 3,148 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 Operating lease obligations 21,044 3,870 2,699 3,523 10,952 Long-term debt 547 \u0097 267 280 \u0097 Interest payments 892 535 357 \u0097 \u0097 Facility financing obligations 90,314 \u0097 9,684 18,858 61,772 Purchase obligations 9,824 5,154 3,734 936 \u0097 Total contractual obligations $ 127,524 $ 11,314 $ 19,889 $ 23,597 $ 72,724 \n \n 80 \n \n Capital lease obligations consist of obligations under capital leases for computer equipment. \n \n Operating lease obligations consist of obligations under non-cancelable operating leases for our existing and new headquarters (both in Brooklyn, New York) and for our offices in San Francisco, California and Dublin, Ireland. \n \n Long-term debt consists of obligations we assumed in connection with our acquisition of Incubart SAS. \n \n Interest payments consist of interest due in connection with our capital leases. \n \n Facility financing obligations consist of the portion of our obligations for our new headquarters in Brooklyn, New York that is accounted for as a build-to-suit lease. \n \n Purchase obligations consist of commitments for our co-location and other support services. For those agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate what the total obligation may be beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing. \n \n In addition, we have uncertain tax positions of $0.4 million, which are not reflected in the table as the ultimate resolution and timing are uncertain. \n \n Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates \n \n Our management\u0092s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. \n \n We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, income taxes, internal-use software and website development costs, business combinations, goodwill and intangible assets, leases and stock-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements. \n \n Revenue Recognition \n \n We operate a platform for third-party sellers. Our business model is based on shared success: we make money when Etsy sellers make money, and we offer services to help Etsy sellers be more successful. We do not compete with Etsy sellers, hold inventory or sell goods. Our revenue is diversified, generated from a mix \n \n 81 \n \n of marketplace activities and the services we provide Etsy sellers to help them create and grow their businesses. Our revenue consists of Marketplace revenue, Seller Services revenue and Other revenue. Our revenue is recorded net of actual and expected refunds. Marketplace revenue includes the fee an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and the listing fee an Etsy seller pays for each item she lists. Seller Services revenue includes fees an Etsy seller pays for services such as prominent placement in search results via Promoted Listings, payment processing via Direct Checkout and purchases of shipping labels through our platform via Shipping Labels. We deduct our cost of shipping labels and estimated refunds from gross shipping fees to determine net shipping fees. Other revenue includes the fees we receive from a third-party payment processor. \n \n We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the Etsy seller; (3) the collection of fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the Etsy seller is fixed or determinable. We evaluate whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon our evaluation of whether we: are the primary obligor in a transaction, have inventory risk and have latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers. Based on our evaluation of these factors, revenue is recorded net of merchandise values associated with the transaction. \n \n Marketplace revenue. Marketplace revenue consists of the 3.5% fee that an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction on our platform, exclusive of shipping fees charged. Marketplace revenue also consists of a listing fee of $0.20 per item that she lists in our marketplace. Although revenue from completed Wholesale transactions is included in Marketplace revenue, revenue from Wholesale enrollment is included in Seller Services revenue. Transaction fees are recognized when the corresponding transaction is made. Listing fees are recognized ratably over a four-month listing period, unless the item is sold or the seller relists it, at which time any remaining listing fee is recognized. \n \n Seller Services revenue. Seller Services revenue consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us for the Seller Services she uses, including Promoted Listings, Direct Checkout, Shipping Labels and Wholesale. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Promoted Listings consists of cost-per-click based fees an Etsy seller pays us for prominent placement of her listings in search results generated by Etsy buyers in our marketplace. Revenue is recognized when the Promoted Listing is clicked. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Direct Checkout consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us to process credit, debit and Etsy Gift Card payments. Direct Checkout fees vary between 3\u00964% of the item\u0092s total sale price plus a flat fee per order, depending on the country in which her bank account is located. Direct Checkout fees are taken from the item\u0092s total sale price, including shipping. Revenue from Direct Checkout is recognized when the corresponding transaction is made. Revenue from breakage on Etsy Gift Cards is recognized when the amount is probable and estimable. Given the lack of historical experience related to gift card activity, there has been no breakage revenue recorded to date. \n \n 82 \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Shipping Labels consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us when she purchases shipping labels through our platform, net of the cost we incur in purchasing those shipping labels. We are able to provide our sellers shipping labels from the United States Postal Service and Canada Post at a discounted price due to the volume of purchases through our platform. We recognize Shipping Label revenue when an Etsy seller purchases a shipping label. We recognize Shipping Label revenue on a net basis as we are not the primary obligor in the delivery of these services. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Wholesale consists of fees an Etsy seller pays us when she is approved to enroll in our Wholesale program. The one-time Wholesale enrollment fee is recognized ratably over the estimated customer life. Revenue from completed Wholesale transactions is included in Marketplace revenue. \n \n Other revenue. Other revenue includes the fees we receive from a third-party payment processor. Other revenue is recognized as the transactions are processed by the third-party payment processor. \n \n Income Taxes \n \n We account for income tax benefit (provision) based on (loss) income before income taxes, and we use the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We assess the need for a valuation allowance on an annual basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to be realized. \n \n We account for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement. We have no unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012 and 2013 and have an unrecognized tax benefit of $0.4 million as of December 31, 2014. \n \n We recognize interest and penalties, if any, associated with tax matters as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in our consolidated balance sheet. \n \n Website Development and Internal-Use Software \n \n We capitalize certain costs incurred in connection with software developed for our platform and software developed for internal use. In accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding and it is probable that the project will be completed and the \n \n 83 \n \n software will be used as intended. We also capitalize costs related to upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality or will extend the useful life of existing functionality. These costs are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically three years. \n \n We periodically review these assets to determine whether the projects will be completed, placed in service, removed from service or replaced by other internally-developed or third-party software; if an asset is not expected to provide any future benefit, the asset is retired and any unamortized cost is expensed. \n \n Costs related to the design or maintenance of software developed for our platform and software developed for internal use are expensed as incurred. \n \n Business Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Assets \n \n We have completed a number of acquisitions of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future. The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. We allocate the purchase price, which is the sum of the consideration provided and may consist of cash, equity or a combination of the two, in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenues and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. \n \n When we issue stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company\u0092s stockholders, we evaluate whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company\u0092s stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period. \n \n We carry intangible assets at cost, and we amortize them on a straight-line basis, which approximates the pattern of the benefits derived, over their estimated useful lives, typically three to five years. When circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, we review our identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment. \n \n Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, as well as when events indicate that the carrying amount of this asset may exceed its fair value. The assessment is performed at the reporting unit level using the two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment. The first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the book value including goodwill. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the book value, goodwill is not impaired. If the book value exceeds the fair value, the second step of the process is performed to measure the amount of the impairment. The accounting guidance also allows for a simplified approach to testing for impairment, in \n \n 84 \n \n which a company can assess certain qualitative factors (referred to as \u0093step zero\u0094) to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If that is the case, the entity must perform the quantitative analysis. \n \n No impairment of goodwill was recorded at December 31, 2013 or 2014. \n \n Leases \n \n We lease office space and certain computer equipment in multiple locations under non-cancelable lease agreements. The leases are reviewed for classification as operating or capital leases. For operating leases, rent is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease period. For capital leases, we record the leased asset with a corresponding liability. Payments are recorded as reductions to the liability with an appropriate interest charge recorded based on their outstanding remaining liability. \n \n We consider the nature of the renovations and our involvement during the construction period of newly-leased office space to determine if we are considered to be the owner of the construction project during the construction period. If we determine that we are the owner of the construction project, we are required to capitalize the fair value of the building as well as the construction costs incurred on our consolidated balance sheet along with a corresponding financing liability (\u0093build-to-suit accounting\u0094). Upon occupancy for build-to-suit leases, we assess whether the circumstances qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the lease meets the sale-leaseback criteria, we will remove the asset and related financial obligation from the balance sheet and treat the building lease as an operating lease. If upon completion of construction, the project does not meet the \u0093sale-leaseback\u0094 criteria, the leased property will be treated as a capital lease for financial reporting purposes. \n \n Stock-Based Compensation \n \n Stock options awarded to employees, members of our board of directors and non-employee third parties are measured at fair value at each grant date. We consider what we believe to be comparable publicly-traded companies, discounted free cash flows and an analysis of our enterprise value in estimating the fair value of our common stock. Options generally vest over a four-year period with 25% of the shares underlying the options vesting on the date that is 12 months after the vesting commencement date and thereafter 1/48th of the shares vesting each month, subject to continued service with us through each vesting date. \n \n Stock-based compensation cost is measured on the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award using a Black-Scholes pricing model and recognized as an expense over the employee\u0092s or director\u0092s requisite service period on a straight-line basis. We expect to continue to grant stock options in the future, and, to the extent that we do, our stock-based compensation expense recognized in future periods will likely increase. \n \n We account for stock-based compensation arrangements with non-employees using a fair value approach. The fair value of these options is measured using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model reflecting the \n \n 85 \n \n same assumptions as applied to employee options in each of the reported periods, other than the expected life, which is assumed to be the contractual life of the option. The compensation costs of these arrangements are subject to remeasurement over the vesting terms as earned. \n \n We account for stock-based compensation arrangements in restricted shares, subject to a put option that allows the holder of the shares to put the shares back to us for cash, as liability-classified stock awards. These awards are re-measured at each reporting period, with changes in fair value being charged to the statement of operations. Compensation expense is recognized using a graded vesting methodology for each separately vesting tranche of the award as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. Unless the put option is exercised, the restricted shares will be reclassified from a liability to an equity classified award upon the termination of the put option. \n \n Key Assumptions \n \n Our Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, the expected term of the option and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management\u0092s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. \n \n \u0095 Fair Value of Our Common Stock. Because our stock is not publicly traded, we must estimate the fair value of our common stock, as discussed in \u0093\u0097Common Stock Valuations\u0094 below. \n \n \u0095 Expected Volatility. As we have not been a public company and do not have a trading history for our common stock, the expected stock price volatility for our common stock is estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for industry peers based on daily price observations over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock option grants. Industry peers, which we have selected, consist of several public companies in the industry similar in size, stage of life cycle and financial leverage. These industry peers are also used in our common stock valuations. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be used in the calculation. \n \n \u0095 Risk-free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yields of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities similar to the expected term of the options for each option group. \n \n \u0095 Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding. As we do not have sufficient historical experience for determining the expected term of the stock option awards granted, we base our expected term for awards issued to employees or \n \n 86 \n \n members of our board of directors on the simplified method, which represents the average period from vesting to the expiration of the stock option. For grants to non-employees, the expected term is equal to the contractual term, which is generally ten years. \n \n \u0095 Expected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends to common stockholders and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero. \n \n In determining the fair value of stock options granted, the following weighted average assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model for awards granted in the periods indicated: \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Assumptions: Expected volatility 42.7% \u0096 43.9% 45.7% \u0096 50.3% 43.0% \u0096 49.0% Risk-free interest rate 0.7% \u0096 1.1% 0.9% \u0096 1.9% 1.7% \u0096 2.1% Expected term (in years) 5.12 \u0096 6.08 5.48 \u0096 6.08 5.46 \u0096 6.08 Dividend rate \u0097% \u0097% \u0097% \n \n Common Stock Valuations \n \n The fair value of our common stock underlying stock options has historically been determined by our board of directors, with assistance from management, based upon information available at the time of grant. Given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, or the Practice Aid, our board of directors has exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock at each grant date. These factors included: \n \n \u0095 contemporaneous third-party valuations of our common stock; \n \n \u0095 the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred stock relative to the common stock; \n \n \u0095 the prices of preferred stock sold by us to third-party investors in arms-length transactions; \n \n \u0095 the prices of common stock sold to third-party investors by us and in secondary transactions or repurchased by us in arms-length transactions; \n \n \u0095 our operating and financial performance; \n \n \u0095 current business conditions and projections; \n \n \u0095 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying these stock options, such as an initial public offering or sale of our company, given prevailing market conditions; \n \n 87 \n \n \u0095 the lack of marketability of our common stock; \n \n \u0095 the market performance of comparable publicly traded e-commerce and technology companies; and \n \n \u0095 the U.S. and global economic and capital market conditions and outlook. \n \n The per share estimated fair value of our common stock in the table below represents the determination by our board of directors of the fair value of our common stock as of the date of grant, taking into consideration the various objective and subjective factors described above, including the valuations of our common stock. There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates and, if we had made different assumptions than those described below, the fair value of the underlying common stock and amount of our stock-based compensation expense, net loss and net loss per share amounts would have differed. Following the closing of our initial public offering, the fair value per share of our common stock for purposes of determining stock-based compensation will be the closing price of our common stock as reported on the applicable grant date. \n \n The following table summarizes by grant date the number of shares of common stock subject to stock options granted from January 1, 2013 through the date of this prospectus, as well as the associated per share exercise price and the estimated fair value per share of our common stock on the grant date: \n \n Grant Date Number of Shares \n \n Underlying \n \n Options Granted Exercise \n \n Price \n \n per Share Estimated \n \n Fair Value \n \n per Share January 22, 2013 713,810 $ 2.38 $ 2.38 February 4, 2013 1,521,851 $ 2.38 $ 2.38 May 7, 2013 460,384 $ 2.79 $ 2.79 July 17, 2013 236,465 $ 2.79 $ 2.79 September 20, 2013 157,938 $ 3.01 $ 3.01 October 29, 2013 2,263,295 $ 3.01 $ 3.01 December 11, 2013 798,467 $ 3.11 $ 3.11 February 19, 2014 2,203,970 $ 4.13 $ 4.13 March 13, 2014 121,010 $ 4.13 $ 4.13 April 22, 2014 501,064 $ 5.18 $ 5.18 July 16, 2014 1,442,401 $ 5.23 $ 5.23 November 5, 2014 2,132,990 $ 6.19 $ 6.19 November 12, 2014 12,000 $ 6.19 $ 6.19 January 30, 2015 2,037,490 $ 8.50 $ 8.50 \n \n Based on an assumed initial public offering price of $ per share, the midpoint of the offering price range on the cover page of this prospectus, the intrinsic value of stock options outstanding at was $ million, of which $ million and $ million related to stock options that were vested and unvested, respectively, at that date. \n \n In valuing our common stock, our board of directors determined the equity value of our business using the income approach. The income approach estimates the fair value of a company based on the present value of such company\u0092s future estimated cash flows and the residual value of such company beyond the forecast period. These future values are discounted to their present values to reflect the risks inherent in such company achieving these estimated cash flows. Significant inputs of the income approach (in addition to \n \n 88 \n \n our estimated future cash flows themselves) include the long-term growth rate assumed in the residual value, discount rate and normalized long-term operating margin. The terminal value was calculated to estimate our value beyond the forecast period by applying valuation metrics to the final year of our forecasted revenue and discounting that value to the present value using the same weighted average cost of capital, or WACC, applied to the forecasted periods. \n \n For valuations through February 10, 2014, the equity value determined was allocated to the common stock using the Option Pricing Method, or OPM. The OPM treats common stock and preferred stock as call options on an equity value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of the preferred stock. Therefore, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution to the stockholders exceed the value of the liquidation preference at the time of a liquidity event such as a merger, sale or initial public offering, assuming the enterprise has funds available to make a liquidation preference meaningful and collectible by the stockholders. The common stock is modeled to be a call option with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after the preferred stock is liquidated. The OPM uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to price the call options. The OPM is appropriate to use when the range of possible future outcomes is so difficult to predict that forecasts would be highly speculative. \n \n Beginning with the March 31, 2014 valuation, we changed the methodology for allocating our equity value to our common stock to a probability weighted expected return method, or PWERM. We made this change as greater certainty developed regarding a possible liquidity event. The PWERM methodology relies on a forward-looking analysis to predict the possible future value of a company. Under this method, discrete future outcomes, including initial public offering, non-IPO scenarios and a merger or sale are weighted based on our estimate of the probability of each scenario. We applied a hybrid method of the PWERM where the non-IPO scenario is modeled using an OPM to reflect the full distribution of possible non-IPO outcomes. The hybrid method is useful when certain discrete future outcomes can be predicted, but also accounts for uncertainty regarding the timing or likelihood of specific alternative exit events. \n \n Recent Accounting Pronouncements \n \n Under the JOBS Act, we meet the definition of an emerging growth company. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. \n \n In March 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued new accounting guidance clarifying the accounting for the release of cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a company either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2013. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements. \n \n 89 \n \n In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that will replace existing revenue recognition guidance. Among other things, the updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. \n \n In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update under which management will be required to assess an entity\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern and provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and for annual and interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on our financial statements or disclosures. \n \n Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk \n \n We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below. \n \n Interest Rate Sensitivity \n \n Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2014 were held primarily in cash deposits and money market funds. The fair value of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments would not be significantly affected by either an increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short-term nature of these instruments. As of December 31, 2014, no amounts were outstanding under our credit facility. Any future borrowings incurred under the credit facility would accrue interest at a floating rate based on a formula tied to certain market rates at the time of incurrence (as described above). A 10% increase or decrease in our current interest rate would not have a significant impact on our interest expense. \n \n Foreign Currency Risk \n \n Most of our sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, our revenue is not currently subject to significant foreign currency risk. Our operating expenses are denominated in the currencies of the countries in which our operations are located, and may be subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly changes in the Pound Sterling and Euro. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of operations. A 10% increase or decrease in current exchange rates could result in additional income or expense of $1.8 million. \n \n 90 \n \n Letter from Chad \n \n The Etsy Economy \n \n Since inception, Etsy has challenged conventional ways of thinking about commerce, business, individuals and communities. I intend to keep our unconventional operating philosophy as we become a public company, and I welcome new investors into our community. \n \n When I joined Etsy almost seven years ago, Etsy was an online marketplace for handmade goods, vintage items and craft supplies that connected sellers and buyers. Even in my early days at Etsy, it was clear to me that the vision for Etsy could extend far beyond the founding idea of the company and have even more potential to impact the world for good. \n \n Vision is just the starting point. I believe Etsy can truly change the world when our vision is met with strong culture, a powerful team and disciplined execution. In my time at Etsy, I\u0092ve put my heart and soul into nurturing a culture and building a team and company that match the ambition of our mission. Today our mission is much more expansive than when Etsy began: to reimagine commerce in ways that build a more fulfilling and lasting world. \n \n The reimagination of commerce means transforming every aspect of how goods are made, bought and sold. We believe that Etsy has the long-term potential to transform the world economy into one that is more people-centered and community-focused\u0097one that values and honors designers and makers and one that creates stronger connections among people who make, sell and buy goods. We see an economy that is more sustainable and transparent\u0097and one that is more joyful. We believe in an economy that transcends price and convenience, one that emphasizes relationships over transactions and optimizes for authorship and provenance. We call this the Etsy Economy. \n \n Building the Etsy Economy matters more than ever. For decades now, the conventional and dominant retail model has relentlessly focused on delivering goods at the lowest price, valuing products and profits over community, short-changing the future with the instant gratification of today. I do not believe that this race to the bottom is a sustainable, successful model. Our growing community has made it clear that they desire thoughtful alternatives to mass commerce and impersonal retail and products that better reflect their personal style and values. Person by person, sale by sale, we are building a new model to replace the old. With GMS of $1.93 billion in 2014, I see the Etsy Economy emerging. \n \n 91 \n \n Etsy\u0092s Values \n \n If you want to understand Etsy, you\u0092ll have to understand our values. \n \n \u0095 We are a mindful, transparent and humane business. \n \n \u0095 We plan and build for the long term. \n \n \u0095 We value craftsmanship in all we make. \n \n \u0095 We believe fun should be part of everything we do. \n \n \u0095 We keep it real, always. \n \n Fundamentally, we believe that companies can and should use the power of business to create social good, which is reflected in our status as a Certified B Corporation. Our commitment to using business as a force of good manifests itself in the way we run our business. \n \n People often ask me how I choose between the success of our community and the success of our business. My answer is that I don\u0092t have to choose; we have built a business that does well when our community is successful. Making money matters to Etsy because our financial success creates long-term sustainability for our community. The more we invest in our platform, the more we enable Etsy sellers to pursue their craft and grow their businesses and the easier we make it for Etsy buyers to find unique goods. We call this Etsy\u0092s Empowerment Loop. \n \n Community \n \n At Etsy, we believe that our strength and business success rest in the interdependence among Etsy sellers, Etsy buyers, responsible manufacturers and our employees\u0097in other words, our community. \n \n Etsy sellers represent a diverse mosaic of needs and aspirations. Some sellers are first-time small business owners and benefit greatly from our seller support and education programs. The vast majority of sellers on Etsy are one-person shops, and we continue to embrace and develop new ways to support them. Other sellers have grown and need help scaling with the assistance of responsible manufacturers, creating opportunity for other participants in the Etsy Economy. In all cases, we empower each Etsy seller to succeed on her own terms. \n \n I have heard concerns that by allowing our sellers to partner with responsible manufacturers, we are diluting our handmade ethos. I share our community\u0092s desire to preserve what is special about Etsy. After all, Etsy has always served as an antidote to mass manufacturing. We still do. With our vision of responsible manufacturing, we are promoting a new, people-centered model in which artisans can preserve the spirit of craftsmanship and grow responsibly by collaborating with people at small-batch manufacturers to make their goods. This brings more hands together to build both products and \n \n 92 \n \n more diverse local, living economies. These local, living economies band together into a larger Etsy Economy made up of individuals with diverse roles but all sharing a collective vision of an economy based on community. \n \n When individuals share a collective vision, the power and possibility of community manifest in profound ways. Etsy is, by design, a collection of many small things. As we grow, Etsy becomes a larger collection of individuals and communities, with compounding benefits when they connect with each other. Etsy sellers have self-organized into more than 10,000 groups around the world, known as \u0093Etsy Teams.\u0094 They provide local support to each other and collaborate with Etsy on initiatives, such as teaching entrepreneurship to economically disadvantaged people in their communities, lobbying the government on issues important to Etsy sellers, running local craft fairs and translating Etsy\u0092s site into other languages. \n \n In 2012, Mayor Larry Morrissey reached out to me on Twitter asking how to build an Etsy Economy in his community of Rockford, Illinois. Rockford is a city that has faced challenges familiar to many cities in America and around the world: loss of manufacturing jobs, high unemployment and a struggling economy. We worked with Mayor Morrissey, members of the local Rockford Etsy Team, the public education system, local arts organizations and the public housing authority to launch the Etsy Craft Entrepreneurship Program. This program teaches people with a craft skill that entrepreneurship and economic opportunity are within reach on our platform. We have extended this program to 10 cities around the world and see it as an inspirational model for even deeper community involvement in the coming years. \n \n Our concept of community includes the cities where we live and work, and we run Etsy in a way that supports our own local economy and ecosystem. At our headquarters in Brooklyn, twice a week we serve a meal that we call \u0093Eatsy.\u0094 Our approach is to foster community and productivity through a meal, designed for employees to eat together on picnic-style benches. This meal allows employees to engage with each other, within and across teams, and increases team-building and work relationships throughout the company. Eatsy also serves as an end point for company-wide meetings, so that employees can continue the conversation on important workplace topics. \n \n In 2014, we sourced food from over 40 local businesses with an emphasis on our health and ecological impact. We eat on compostable plates, and employees sign up to deliver our compost by bike to a local farm in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where it is turned back into the soil that produces the food we enjoy together. In this way, Eatsy goes into the very soil we live and work on. Eatsy is a metaphor for how I think about many aspects of our business and our relationship to the world around us: regenerative, mindful, interdependent, community-based and fun. \n \n 93 \n \n Why Etsy Should be a Public Company \n \n I believe the principles and resources of being a public company align well with the model of shared success that is fundamental to Etsy\u0092s way of doing business, namely that we make money when our sellers make money. Investing in the growth of our business and increasing Etsy\u0092s visibility will help elevate Etsy sellers and attract more buyers, which creates more opportunities for everyone. \n \n Accountability / transparency \n \n Etsy has a long history of providing data to the community, everything from key financial metrics, to our gross happiness index, to our carbon footprint data, to our workplace diversity stats. As a public company, we will be able to provide a higher level of transparency and accountability to a broader number of people. \n \n Community participation \n \n Being a private company means that most people don\u0092t have an opportunity to invest in Etsy. When Etsy is a public company, anyone will be able to own a piece of Etsy, including our sellers, our buyers and anyone else who shares Etsy\u0092s values and mission. These shareholders will be valued members of our community. \n \n Long-term sustainability \n \n We want to be a company that spans generations. Eighty-six of the original companies in the S&P 500 index are still publicly traded after 58 years. I view going public as an important step towards providing Etsy with the capital and long-term corporate structure to achieve similar longevity. \n \n Making the world more like Etsy \n \n I believe that Etsy can be a public company that holistically integrates the concerns of people and the planet, the present and the future, profitability and accountability. If we succeed, then other companies might replicate our model. We think the world will be a better place for it. \n \n As a public company, we will continue to concentrate on the long term. Our mission to reimagine commerce is a big goal and it will take time to achieve it; success will be based on strategies that evolve over years and decades, not just quarters. We are more focused on creating long-term results for us and our community than short-term results that lack that promise. \n \n I believe this approach will deliver the most sustainable long-term returns to investors. \n \n 94 \n \n When we\u0092re public, we do not plan to give quarterly or annual earnings guidance. I think providing quantitative earnings guidance is misaligned with Etsy\u0092s mission. For example, the pressure to hit a quarterly financial target could incent us too heavily to seek near-term gains, which could diminish our ability to fulfill our larger mission over the long-term. \n \n We will continue to be transparent with our investors. Instead of providing guidance in the traditional sense, I plan to talk frequently with our investors about our progress, challenges and opportunities. I welcome investors who share our long-term, community-oriented philosophy. \n \n What\u0092s Ahead \n \n I am intensely grateful to all of the people who have given so much of themselves to build Etsy, and I am excited to welcome new like-minded shareholders to our community. \n \n We are entering a new era. I believe that successful businesses will be those that combine vision, execution and discipline with values, heart and conviction. That is how I plan to lead Etsy and work with our community to build a more fulfilling and lasting world through commerce. Etsy will be entering its second decade this year, and we look forward to many more in our new form as a public company. \n \n Onward, \n \n 95 \n \n Business \n \n Our Mission \n \n Our mission is to reimagine commerce in ways that build a more fulfilling and lasting world. \n \n We are building a human, authentic and community-centric global and local marketplace. We are committed to using the power of business to create a better world through our platform, our members, our employees and the communities we serve. \n \n Overview \n \n We operate a marketplace where people around the world connect, both online and offline, to make, sell and buy unique goods. Handmade goods are the foundation of our marketplace. Whether crafted by an Etsy seller herself, with the assistance of her team or with an outside manufacturer in small batches, handmade goods spring from the imagination and creativity of an Etsy seller and embody authorship, responsibility and transparency. We believe we are creating a new economy, which we call the Etsy Economy, where creative entrepreneurs find meaningful work and both global and local markets for their goods, and where thoughtful consumers discover and buy unique goods and build relationships with the people who sell them. \n \n Etsy was founded in June 2005 in Brooklyn, New York as a marketplace for handmade goods and craft supplies. From those beginnings, we have built an innovative, technology-based platform that, as of December 31, 2014, connected 54.0 million members, including 1.4 million active sellers and 19.8 million active buyers, in nearly every country in the world. In 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion, of which 36.1% came from purchases made on mobile devices and 30.9% came from an Etsy seller or an Etsy buyer outside of the United States. \n \n Our Community \n \n Our community is the heart and soul of Etsy. Our community is made up of creative entrepreneurs who sell on our platform, thoughtful consumers looking to buy unique goods in our marketplace, responsible manufacturers who help Etsy sellers grow their businesses and Etsy employees who maintain our platform and nurture our ecosystem. \n \n 96 \n \n Our business model is based on shared success: we make money when Etsy sellers make money. Our revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services we provide Etsy sellers to help them create and grow their businesses. Marketplace revenue includes the fee an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and the listing fee an Etsy seller pays for each item she lists. Seller Services revenue includes fees an Etsy seller pays for services such as prominent placement in search results via Promoted Listings, payment processing via Direct Checkout and purchases of shipping labels through our platform via Shipping Labels. Other revenue includes the fees we receive from a third-party payment processor. \n \n In 2014, Etsy sellers generated GMS of $1.93 billion, up 43.3% over 2013. In 2014, we generated revenue of $195.6 million, up 56.4% over 2013. In 2014, we generated a net loss of $15.2 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $23.1 million compared to a net loss of $0.8 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $16.9 million in 2013. See \u0093Selected Consolidated Financial and Other Data\u0097Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u0094 for more information and for a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net (loss) income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. \n \n Our Values \n \n Our values are integral to everything we do. \n \n We are a mindful, transparent and humane business. We believe that business interests and social and environmental responsibility are interwoven and aligned and that the power of business should be used to strengthen communities and empower people. To demonstrate our commitment, each year we publish a Values & Impact report to monitor and then publicly report our efforts to minimize the harm and maximize the benefit that we have on people and the planet. B Lab, an independent nonprofit organization, has certified us as a B Corporation for our adherence to rigorous social and environmental standards, and Fortune has recognized us as a great place to work in both 2013 and 2014. \n \n We plan and build for the long term. We want to build a company that lasts, and we plan to measure our success in years and decades. Etsy sellers in particular depend on us and on our platform to grow their businesses, so we will strive to make decisions that are best for the long-term health of our ecosystem. \n \n We value craftsmanship in all we make. Craftsmanship is the marriage of skill and passion. We believe every job at our company should demonstrate our commitment to craft. We are an engineering-driven company, and we think of our code as craft: we are makers of the products and services that our members use, and we approach the work we do with the same care and inspiration as do Etsy sellers. \n \n 97 \n \n We believe fun should be part of everything we do. Our mission includes fostering a world in which personal fulfillment is a key element of success. We believe that this way of working is connected and joyful. We strive to do excellent work and bring a sense of humor and playfulness to it. \n \n We keep it real, always. We have the courage and the will to do business in ways that are unconventional and impactful. We strive to stay genuine, maintaining integrity, humility and sincerity in everything we do. When we feel that we are not being true to our values or our mission, we are not afraid to stop and change course. \n \n Our Community \n \n Our community includes Etsy sellers, Etsy buyers, responsible manufacturers and Etsy employees. \n \n Etsy Sellers: Creative Entrepreneurs \n \n Etsy sellers join our community to be part of a vibrant global-local marketplace that allows them to express their creativity and turn their passion into a business while connecting to thoughtful consumers locally and around the world. As of December 31, 2014, there were 1.4 million active sellers on our platform and more than 11% of active sellers as of that date had been selling on Etsy for more than four years. \n \n Etsy Sellers \n \n We support a diverse group of artists, makers, designers and collectors from around the world\u0097from the solo artisan to the full-time jewelry maker with staff; from the antique furniture collector to the textile graphic designer partnering with a small-batch manufacturer. \n \n Etsy sellers range from hobbyists to professional merchants, and have a broad range of personal and professional goals. In November 2014, we conducted a survey of U.S. Etsy sellers who made a sale in the preceding 12 months, to which 4,000 sellers responded. The 2014 Seller Survey reveals a unique population of Internet-enabled creative entrepreneurs who are building businesses on their own terms\u0097prioritizing flexibility, independence and creativity. Some Etsy sellers are looking for extra pocket money, while others depend on their shops to support themselves and their families. According to our 2014 Seller Survey, among U.S. Etsy sellers: \n \n \u0095 86% are women; \n \n 98 \n \n \u0095 95% run their shops from their homes; \n \n \u0095 90% aspire to grow their sales in the future; \n \n \u0095 79% started their Etsy shop as an outlet for creativity; \n \n \u0095 65% started their Etsy shop as a way to supplement income; and \n \n \u0095 76% consider their Etsy shop to be a business. \n \n Etsy Buyers: Thoughtful Consumers \n \n Etsy buyers visit our marketplace to discover a broad selection of unique goods that are hard to find elsewhere, ranging from a $5 ornament to a $50 hand-knit sweater to a $2,000 custom-made coffee table. We believe many Etsy buyers are motivated by more than simply price and convenience; we believe they also value craftsmanship, artistry, uniqueness, authenticity and sustainability. We find that Etsy buyers want to know how items were made, where they were made and who made them. In our marketplace, Etsy buyers can enjoy a personalized shopping experience and direct interactions with Etsy sellers. Etsy buyers can also purchase customized items or other bespoke goods from Etsy sellers. By buying in our marketplace, Etsy buyers are supporting creative entrepreneurs in their local communities and around the world. As of December 31, 2014, there were 19.8 million active buyers on our platform. \n \n Marketplace Activity \n \n Etsy buyers also include retailers we have selected for our Wholesale offering, which we launched in August 2014. From local boutiques to national chains such as Nordstrom, West Elm and Whole Foods, retailers use our platform to connect with new artists and designers and to add unique and distinctive items to their store offerings. As of December 31, 2014, more than 6,500 local boutiques and three U.S. national retail chains had been invited to join our Wholesale offering. \n \n Responsible Manufacturers \n \n We are committed to helping Etsy sellers who want to work with responsible, small-batch manufacturing partners to increase their production. An Etsy seller might work with a cut-and-sew shop to make clothes she has designed, a casting house that casts her wax models for her jewelry designs or a digital printing \n \n 99 \n \n house that prints her photographs on household items. We ask Etsy sellers to work with manufacturers who adhere to our ethical expectations: humane working conditions, non-discrimination policies, sustainability practices and no child, youth or involuntary labor. As of December 31, 2014, we had approved more than 3,000 Etsy shops for over 5,000 manufacturing partnerships. Much of this production is local: as of December 31, 2014, 86% of manufacturers partnering with Etsy sellers were located in the same country as the Etsy seller. \n \n Etsy Employees \n \n We too are members of our community. Whether crafting our policies, talking with Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers in our online forums or building the tools and services underlying our marketplace, our employees create lasting, authentic connections in our community. Etsy employees emphasize building personal relationships with Etsy sellers, visiting their shops, inviting them to our offices for lunch or celebrating with them at in-person events. \n \n Our Opportunity \n \n We operate at the center of several converging macroeconomic trends in online and mobile commerce, employment, consumption and manufacturing. We believe that in combination these trends will benefit millions of people in our ecosystem around the world: Etsy sellers engaging in their creative passion, working for themselves and defining success on their own terms; Etsy buyers accessing a diverse, global marketplace of goods that have historically been found in highly fragmented markets; and, increasingly, responsible manufacturers using modern tools to craft goods in partnership with Etsy sellers. \n \n Trends in Our Favor \n \n Trends in Online and Mobile Commerce \n \n Etsy sellers offer goods in dozens of online retail categories, including jewelry, stationery, clothing, home goods, craft supplies and vintage items. Euromonitor, a consumer market research company, estimated that the global online retail market was $695 billion in 2013, up from $280 billion in 2008, representing a \n \n 100 \n \n compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 19.9%. This growth is expected to continue, with the global online retail market becoming a significantly larger portion of the total retail market, reaching $1.5 trillion by 2018, implying a 16.6% CAGR from 2013. \n \n Mobile commerce is also increasingly important in online retail. comScore estimated that since the first quarter of 2013, consumers visiting online commerce sites spent more than half of their browsing time on mobile devices; however, online commerce spending via mobile devices represented only 11% of total online commerce dollars in the third quarter of 2014. \n \n Trends in Employment \n \n Whether motivated by economic necessity or personal preference, a growing number of people are turning to self-employment for their livelihoods. \n \n In a 2012 survey of middle-class households in the United States by the Pew Research Center, 85% said that it was more difficult to maintain their living standards today than it was ten years ago. The erosion of middle-income jobs is not unique to the United States: we believe middle-class families in many developed countries face similar challenges. Responding to these challenges, many people supplement their incomes and support their families by becoming freelancers, and freelancers are now making significant contributions to their respective economies. A study commissioned in July 2014 by the Freelancers Union and Elance-oDesk, or the Freelancer Study, estimated that 53 million Americans are working as freelancers, or 34% of the U.S. workforce. The same study estimated that this freelance workforce adds $715 billion to the U.S. economy each year. \n \n Brandi Harper, Etsy Shop: purlBknit, Brooklyn, NY \n \n The Freelancer Study also found that millennials (workers under 35) represent a source of growth in the number of Americans working as freelancers. Millennials are more likely to freelance than older workers\u009738% of millennials are freelancing, compared to 32% of workers over 35\u0097and many millennials have spent their entire working lives in this freelance era. Millennial freelancers are also more likely to search out work that has \u0093a positive impact on the world\u0094 (62% of millennials vs. 54% of non-millennials) or is \u0093exciting\u0094 (62% of millennials vs. 47% of non-millennials). \n \n 101 \n \n Many other people are motivated by similar personal priorities to start their own businesses. In 2012, a Harvard Business School study found that \u0093autonomy\u0094 was a top motivation in a faculty survey of 2,000 business founders, amongst all age cohorts and for both men and women. \n \n Women are also contributing to the trend towards self-employment. According to an October 2012 analysis by Booz and Company, by 2020, 865 million women worldwide who have not previously been part of the economic mainstream will join as producers, consumers, employees and entrepreneurs. World Bank research shows that, in certain developing nations, over half of the women in the labor force are self-employed. \n \n In combination, these data underscore the importance of tools that help people start and grow their businesses. We believe that many of these freelancers, millennials and women have creative skills that could provide a foundation for entrepreneurship, but that they often have little or no experience running their own businesses, and they typically lack the marketing resources, the technological expertise and the manufacturing and logistics capabilities to turn their creativity into a business. \n \n Trends in Consumption \n \n Most large retailers today follow the same formula, emphasizing efficiency and scale and pressuring their suppliers to reduce their costs in order to serve mass-produced goods at the lowest-possible prices. We believe, however, that many consumers want to purchase goods that are unique and that reflect their personality and style, not simply mass-produced, generic goods. Some consumers want their purchases to reflect their values; they want to support retailers and suppliers that have responsible and sustainable policies toward their employees, their communities and the environment. Finding these goods can be difficult, as markets for such goods have historically been highly fragmented across boutiques, consignment stores and other venues and marketplaces. \n \n Chris and Katie Francis, Lee Goodwin, Olivia Turrell, Etsy Shop: Docksmith, Brunswick, ME \n \n A 2014 Nielsen study reported that global consumers between the ages of 21 and 34 represent 51% of all consumers who are willing to pay extra for sustainable products. The Nielsen study also indicated that 55% of consumers worldwide are willing to pay extra for products and services from companies committed to social impact, a 10% increase from a similar study in 2011, and that 46% of those consumers identified support for small businesses and entrepreneurship as a key cause. \n \n 102 \n \n Still other thoughtful consumers are looking to support their local communities and prefer buying goods that they can trace to an individual person or community. According to a 2014 Havas Worldwide case study, 53% of consumers say that when possible they prefer to buy directly from an individual producer than from a store or shopping center. These consumers prefer to bypass large manufacturers and retailers when possible in favor of buying locally and independently-produced goods. \n \n Trends in Manufacturing \n \n Just as the power of computing, once reserved for government and large businesses, is now available to individuals on their personal computers and mobile devices, individuals and small businesses now have the ability to manufacture goods in their homes and studios using tools such as computer-assisted design, 3D printers, computer-controlled routers and other machines at a fraction of the historical cost. We believe the decrease in the size and the cost of these tools will make it easier for creative entrepreneurs to start new businesses. We also believe that small-batch manufacturers will be able to use these new technologies to provide high-quality manufacturing services to creative entrepreneurs. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2011, approximately 65% of manufacturing establishments had 19 or fewer employees. Manufacturing plants that produce items such as apparel, leather, ornamental metal, furniture, printing materials, cutlery and jewelry tended to have even smaller workforces, as 80% had 19 or fewer employees. We believe that to scale their own businesses, creative entrepreneurs can access this growing number of small-batch manufacturers. \n \n Allison Faunce, Etsy Shop: Little Hero Capes, Somerset, MA \n \n 103 \n \n Our Strengths \n \n Our platform connects millions of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers globally, making it one of the largest online marketplaces in the world. We have achieved our scale because of the following key strengths: \n \n Our Authentic, Trusted Marketplace. We have built an authentic, trusted marketplace that embodies our values-based culture, emphasizing respect, direct communication and fun. We have developed a reputation for authenticity as a result of Etsy sellers\u0092 unique offerings and their adherence to our policies for handmade goods embodying the principles of authorship, responsibility and transparency. We establish trust in our marketplace by emphasizing the person behind every transaction. We deepen connections among our members through our direct communication tools, seller stories on our website and apps and in-person events, making a personal relationship central to the member experience. The authenticity of our marketplace and the connections among people in our community are the cornerstones of our business. \n \n Our Passionate, Engaged and Loyal Members. Our members are passionate, engaged and loyal\u0097not only to us, but to each other\u0097building a strong community. \n \n \u0095 Our active sellers and active buyers remain so for multiple years. For example, 32.3% of active sellers and 44.7% of active buyers as of December 31, 2011 continued to be active sellers and active buyers, respectively, three years later, as of December 31, 2014. In addition, as of December 31, 2014, 11% of active sellers have been selling on Etsy for more than four years. Likewise, as of December 31, 2014, 11% of active buyers have been members for more than four years. \n \n \u0095 Our members\u0092 repeat sales and purchases drive GMS growth. In 2014, 78.5% of our GMS resulted from repeat purchases made by Etsy buyers, and 99.3% of our GMS was generated by repeat sales made by Etsy sellers. \n \n \u0095 Our active sellers and active buyers also log into Etsy frequently. During the fourth quarter of 2014, 78% of active sellers as of December 31, 2014 and 63% of active buyers as of December 31, 2014 logged in to our marketplace. \n \n \u0095 Our members also spend time with each other. For example, Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers sent 216 million messages on our platform in 2014 using our Conversations tool. As of December 31, 2014, 27.7% of active sellers belong to a self-organized Etsy Team, developing supportive personal relationships with other Etsy sellers as they build their independent creative businesses. Currently, over 10,000 Etsy Teams have formed around the world. \n \n 104 \n \n The passion and loyalty demonstrated by Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers underlies the growth and scale of our platform. See \u0093Management\u0092s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u0097Key Factors Affecting Our Performance\u0097Growth and Retention of Active Sellers and Active Buyers\u0094 for more information. \n \n GMS Contribution by Purchase Type \n \n Our Innovative Technology. Our widely-respected engineering team has built a sophisticated platform that enables millions of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers to smoothly transact across borders, languages and devices. Our team is at the forefront of the software engineering practice of continuous deployment. We update our code as often as every 20 minutes, and as many as 70 times per day, with more than 10,000 deploys during the year ended December 31, 2014. To enhance the performance of our platform, we collect and analyze a large volume of data. For example, we currently collect more than 1.8 million discrete metrics, which we expect will increase as we grow. Further, in the field of search relevance and purchase recommendations, we currently collect and analyze more than 1,200 terabytes of data to calculate search and personalization relevance signals in real time to recommend goods to each prospective Etsy buyer from a broad inventory of unique goods. \n \n For the year ended December 31, 2014, 53.2% of our visits and 36.1% of our GMS were generated on a mobile device. We developed our \u0093Sell on Etsy\u0094 mobile app to help the Etsy seller operate her shop and manage orders. Our mobile website and our mobile app for Etsy buyers, which we developed to keep Etsy buyers engaged wherever they are, includes search, discovery, curation, personalization and social shopping features, optimized for the mobile experience. \n \n 105 \n \n Our Scaled, Global-Local Marketplace. Our marketplace is global-local, meaning that we focus on building local Etsy communities around the world. Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers in these local communities, in turn, have global reach and access through our platform. Currently, Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers are based in nearly every country in the world and our marketplace is available in 10 languages. In 2014, 30.9% of our GMS involved an Etsy seller or Etsy buyer outside of the United States. We believe our global-local marketplace creates strong competitive advantages outside the United States because our success is not dependent on scale in any given country; instead, the diverse location of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers creates the scale, and a concentration of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers in any given region can give rise to a vibrant local Etsy marketplace. \n \n Our Seller-Aligned Business Model. Etsy sellers are drawn to our platform because we empower them to succeed, and as Etsy sellers succeed, so do we. Our seller-aligned business model creates network effects. The more we invest in our platform, the more we enable Etsy sellers to pursue their craft and grow their businesses and the easier we make it for Etsy buyers to find unique goods. We call this Etsy\u0092s Empowerment Loop. Some 76% of Etsy sellers consider their Etsy shops to be businesses and 90% want to grow their businesses, as indicated by our 2014 Seller Survey. We focus on offering Seller Services that help an Etsy seller spend more of her time on her creative passion and less of her time on the administrative aspects of running a business. During the year ended December 31, 2014, 46.1% of Etsy sellers used at least one of our Seller Services. Similarly, we have launched our manufacturing and Wholesale offerings in an effort to enable an Etsy seller to grow her business on our platform. \n \n Etsy Empowerment Loop \n \n 106 \n \n Our Strategy: The Path Ahead \n \n Make Etsy an Everyday Experience. The power of human connection is central to the Etsy member experience. We emphasize relationships, connecting creative entrepreneurs to thoughtful consumers around the world, and we continually strive to make those connections a daily habit for our members. \n \n The everyday experience starts with mobile. In 2014, 53.2% of our visits and 36.1% of our GMS were generated on a mobile device: \n \n \u0095 We will continue to help the Etsy seller manage her shop, connect with Etsy buyers and sell her goods on our platform, all on her mobile device. We plan to bring the Etsy experience to local communities, using mobile technology to highlight Etsy sellers\u0092 goods in nearby brick-and-mortar stores and crafts fairs. \n \n \u0095 We will continue to make it easy and fun for Etsy buyers to connect with Etsy sellers and to discover and purchase Etsy sellers\u0092 unique goods, particularly though mobile devices. We plan to improve Etsy buyers\u0092 engagement with our community through enhanced content, search and discovery. \n \n Build Local Marketplaces, Globally. Our vision is global and local. In 2014, 28.9% of Etsy sellers were located outside the United States, and 30.9% of our GMS involved an Etsy seller or Etsy buyer outside of the United States. Although we promote cross-border transactions, our strategy is to build and deepen local Etsy communities around the world, each with its own ecosystem of Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. To meet this goal, we plan to invest in local marketing and content and local payment and shipping solutions in countries around the world. We believe our locally-focused work will broaden the reach of our global platform. \n \n Kamma Spring, Etsy Shop: Lorgie, Fremantle, Australia \n \n 107 \n \n Offer High-impact Seller Services. Seller Services, such as Promoted Listings, Direct Checkout and Shipping Labels, help an Etsy seller spend more time on the pleasures of her craft and less time on the administrative aspects of her business. Seller Services represented $42.8 million, or 34.2%, of our revenue in 2013, a 169.9% increase over 2012, and $82.5 million, or 42.2%, of our revenue in 2014, a 92.7% increase over 2013. According to our 2014 Seller Survey, for every hour that an Etsy seller spends making her products, she spends another hour doing business-related tasks, including inventory management, shipping, customer service, marketing and accounting. We intend to enhance existing Seller Services, extend their geographic reach and introduce new ones to increase the amount of time an Etsy seller can devote to her craft. \n \n How an Etsy Seller Spends Her Time \n \n Expand the Etsy Economy. We intend to fulfill our mission to reimagine commerce by expanding the impact of our platform beyond our community. By further developing our manufacturing program, we believe we will help Etsy sellers who want to grow their businesses connect with skilled partners, while helping to revitalize small-batch manufacturing in local communities. We will also continue to focus on our Wholesale offering, which we launched in August 2014, so that Etsy sellers can sell their products to select retail partners such as Nordstrom, West Elm and Whole Foods. Finally, we plan to focus on strategic partnerships, technological advances and public-private endeavors such as our Craft Entrepreneurship program, which we believe will bring the benefit of the Etsy Economy to more people and more communities. \n \n 108 \n \n Invest in Marketing. We believe that the rapid growth of our marketplace is a testament to our compelling value proposition for Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers. Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers have been our best marketers, and the majority of our visits have come from direct and organic channels. Historically, we have invested relatively small amounts in marketing. We spent only $10.9 million on marketing in 2012 and only $17.9 million in 2013. In 2014, we began increasing our brand and digital marketing efforts and spent $39.7 million in marketing, up 122% from 2013. \n \n We plan to continue to increase our marketing spending on traditional and online media to increase awareness of our brand and attract additional members to our ecosystem. \n \n Visits to Etsy by Channel \n \n Our investment in marketing has shown early signs of success. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2013, we strategically increased our marketing spending in the United Kingdom, our second largest market in terms of number of active sellers, with a goal of growing the number of Etsy buyers in the United Kingdom. In the following twelve months, we spent five times more on search engine marketing in the United Kingdom during the twelve months ended September 30, 2014 than we did during the same period in the prior year. During the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, the number of active buyers in the United Kingdom grew 112.9% year-over-year, compared to 89.0% year-over-year in the same period in the prior year. Additionally, Etsy buyers in the United Kingdom spent more in our marketplace, with the amount spent increasing by 114.2% year-over-year versus 64.7% year-over-year in the same period in the prior year. Our success in the United Kingdom demonstrates our ability to accelerate growth with marketing improvements and increased marketing spending. We intend to apply the key lessons from our experience in the United Kingdom into growing other local Etsy markets around the globe. \n \n 109 \n \n Our Platform \n \n Our platform is an authentic vehicle for person-to-person commerce, both globally and locally. Our platform includes our marketplace, our Seller Services, our technology and our community, both online and offline. The core of our platform is our marketplace, which connects people around the world to make, sell and buy unique goods. \n \n Connecting People through Our Platform \n \n The Etsy Seller Experience \n \n Our platform makes it easy for an Etsy seller to open an Etsy shop and operate her business. We help the Etsy seller in the following ways: \n \n \u0095 Seller Services. We offer a variety of services to help Etsy sellers build their personal brands, engage potential customers and complete transactions. These services include: \n \n \u0095 Promoted Listings. Our Promoted Listings offering enables an Etsy seller to pay a cost-per-click based fee to feature and promote her goods in search results generated by Etsy buyers on our platform. This service allows an Etsy seller to target Etsy buyers who are specifically searching for goods similar to those she offers for sale. As of December 31, 2014, 18.2% of active sellers used Promoted Listings in 2014. \n \n \u0095 Direct Checkout. Our Direct Checkout offering allows Etsy sellers to accept various forms of payment such as credit cards, debit cards and Etsy gift cards. As of December 31, 2014, Direct Checkout was available in 22 countries and 10 currencies. Once an Etsy buyer makes payment, the Etsy seller receives the funds in her own bank account and in her local currency. In addition, in October 2014, we expanded Direct Checkout to enable an Etsy seller in the United States to use our \u0093Sell on Etsy Reader\u0094 to accept credit card and debit card payments in person, whether at her store or her booth at a craft fair. As of December 31, 2014, 36.1% of active sellers used Direct Checkout in 2014. \n \n 110 \n \n \u0095 Shipping Labels. Etsy sellers can purchase United States Postal Service and Canada Post shipping labels through our platform with the appropriate amount of postage. The ability to print shipping labels at home reduces the cost and time it takes Etsy sellers to ship goods to Etsy buyers. As of December 31, 2014, 21.4% of active sellers in the United States and Canada purchased shipping labels through our platform in 2014. \n \n Use of Seller Services in 2014 \n \n \u0095 Mobile. We developed our \u0093Sell on Etsy\u0094 mobile app to help Etsy sellers operate their shops and manage orders. Etsy sellers can also access communication and shop management tools and help resources through the Sell on Etsy mobile app. From its launch in April 2014 through December 31, 2014, 21.9% of active sellers used our Sell on Etsy app. \n \n \u0095 Seller Dashboard. Etsy sellers can analyze visits to their shop and listings, estimate the effectiveness of their spending on Promoted Listings, monitor orders and track sales using our online seller dashboard. Etsy sellers can access the dashboard on our website or on our Sell on Etsy mobile app. \n \n \u0095 Education. We provide extensive educational resources to teach Etsy sellers how to build and grow their businesses on our platform through blog posts, video tutorials, the Etsy Seller Handbook (available on our website), access to our online forums, and insights from our support teams. In addition to our own educational resources, Etsy sellers connect through Etsy Teams to build personal relationships, collaborate, and educate and support each other. \n \n The Etsy Buyer Experience \n \n To help Etsy buyers discover and purchase items that they love, we provide a number of tools, including: \n \n \u0095 Communication. We believe human connection is central to Etsy buyers\u0092 engagement. Etsy buyers and Etsy sellers use the Conversations tool on our platform to communicate, person to person, about their orders, to request custom goods or personalization of goods or simply to have a conversation about the product or the process. In 2014, our members sent 216 million messages on our platform. \n \n \u0095 Search and discovery. Our platform is engineered to provide a personalized experience to each Etsy buyer that adjusts in real time based on her interactions with our marketplace. An Etsy buyer may search for an item using our search tool bar and filter the results by color, price, location or other characteristics. She may browse through items, creating an activity feed by \u0093favoriting\u0094 items that catch \n \n 111 \n \n her eye and by following shops and tastemakers. In 2014, our members tagged 775 million favorites on our platform. We glean insights from Etsy buyers\u0092 interactions through our machine-learning algorithms and through traditional information retrieval techniques, such as cookies. We use these insights to personalize the activity feed an Etsy buyer sees when she comes to Etsy, with suggestions of shops or tastemakers to follow and items to buy or favorite. We use the data we collect and the insights we gain to match Etsy sellers\u0092 goods with Etsy buyers\u0092 tastes and interests. Our community is large and engaged, with more than 4.3 billion search page views in 2013. \n \n Discovering Unique Goods \n \n \u0095 Mobile. We strive to keep Etsy buyers engaged wherever they are, by providing the functionality of our website in iOS and Android mobile apps, specifically crafted for Etsy buyers. Our mobile apps for Etsy buyers include search and discovery, curation, personalization and social shopping features similar to those that Etsy buyers enjoy on our desktop site. Our mobile apps have been downloaded 21.8 million times as of December 31, 2014. \n \n Our Policies \n \n Our members rely on us to maintain a marketplace that meets their expectations for authenticity. Our policies are designed to give the Etsy buyer the comfort that she is purchasing unique goods from a small business that adheres to certain principles. \n \n Most fundamentally, we require that goods listed in our marketplace be handmade, vintage or craft supplies. Handmade items begin with the imagination and creativity of the Etsy seller. To conform to our vision of handmade, we ask that the Etsy seller follow these three principles: \n \n \u0095 Authorship: The Etsy seller should have a meaningful design and creative role in the items she is selling. \n \n \u0095 Responsibility: The Etsy seller should know how her goods are made and by whom. \n \n \u0095 Transparency: The Etsy seller should be open and honest about how her goods are made and by whom. \n \n 112 \n \n Etsy buyers enjoy a high degree of insight into Etsy sellers\u0092 business practices. Our policies encourage Etsy sellers to be transparent about themselves, their businesses and the goods they sell. We enforce our policies through the following: \n \n Integrity team. The job of our Integrity team is to remove items that do not belong in our marketplace. We use a combination of machine learning, automated systems and community-generated queries and flags to review items and shops that may be in violation of our policies. \n \n Trust and Safety team. Our Trust and Safety team uses human review and sophisticated automated tools and algorithms to detect fraud. We cancel transactions if fraud is detected, and we strive to prohibit bad actors from using our platform. \n \n Responsible Seller Growth team. Our Responsible Seller Growth team reviews the application of every Etsy seller who applies to work with an outside manufacturer. We do not review or approve the manufacturer; instead, we look to the Etsy seller to provide evidence of authorship, responsibility and transparency. \n \n Our Case System. Etsy sellers and Etsy buyers communicate via our Case System in instances when items do not arrive or are not as expected. Disputes are often resolved without our involvement. When necessary, we intervene, and when appropriate, we may suspend or terminate the accounts of members who do not adhere to our policies. \n \n Our Unique Engineering Culture and Approach \n \n Etsy engineering is widely known for its thought-leading approaches to software development as well as its unique engineering culture. Our engineering team coined the phrase \u0093Code as Craft\u0094 to describe our love for building software and our melding of engineering discipline and individual craftsmanship. We believe our engineers have the skills, practices and experience needed to embrace the change the future inevitably brings. As of December 31, 2014, our engineering team consisted of 241 employees. \n \n Code as Craft \n \n 113 \n \n Our engineering culture is built on three principles: \n \n \u0095 A mindful and humane approach. We trust humans and we build for humans. We believe that judgment, mindfulness and intelligence can be found and developed in the people doing the work, and our environment provides continuous opportunities to develop those traits. An organization of engaged, empowered, mindful engineers can adapt to inevitable and unpredictable change. \n \n \u0095 A spirit of generosity. Our engineers believe that we are part of a larger community of practice and a larger world, and part of each engineer\u0092s job is improving our team, our company, our industry and the world. Every engineer is expected to contribute to open source software projects and to write or speak publicly. We believe this increases job satisfaction and retention, gives us outsized influence in our industry and eases onboarding as prospective employees can learn about our culture before joining us. \n \n \u0095 Adaptability and learning. We learn through honest, blameless reflection on lessons and surprises. We believe that traditional root-cause analysis makes learning from mistakes difficult. Our blameless post-mortem process is a widely-cited technique that we believe is becoming best practice among organizations that value innovation. Blameless post-mortems drive a significant percentage of our development as we analyze what about our production environment was less then optimal and rapidly make corresponding adjustments. \n \n Our Work Culture \n \n We pride ourselves on our values-based culture. We emphasize respect, direct communication and fun. We focus on maximizing our employees\u0092 professional and personal well-being. We evaluate performance not just on traditional business metrics, but also on societal and environmental goals and on adherence to our mission and values. \n \n We believe employee happiness comes from engaging and fulfilling work and from ample personal and professional growth opportunities. We invest heavily in employee development by offering coaching, skills workshops and training. We actively encourage personal education through arts and crafts workshops and employee-taught classes called \u0093Etsy School,\u0094 covering subjects ranging from screen printing to Python programming. \n \n As of December 31, 2014, we had 685 employees worldwide, with 430 in our offices in Brooklyn, New York. Of those employees, we had 153 in member operations, 332 in product and engineering, 89 in marketing and 111 in corporate. Our product development expenses were $18.7 million, $27.5 million and $36.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. \n \n We proactively work and recruit to improve the gender balance at all levels of our company. As of December 31, 2014, 51% of employees identified as female. As of December 31, 2014, women comprised 46% of managers and 28% of product, engineering and technical operations employees. \n \n 114 \n \n Etsy.org \n \n In January 2015, we formed Etsy.org, a Delaware non-profit organization, to focus on building innovative educational programs that reimagine how and to whom business is taught. In particular, Etsy.org will focus on educating women and other under-represented entrepreneurial populations and empowering them to build businesses that regenerate communities and the planet. In January 2015, we issued 376,471 shares of our common stock to Etsy.org, and we expect to use $300,000 of the proceeds of this offering to partially fund Etsy.org. \n \n Competition \n \n We compete with retailers for the Etsy seller. An Etsy seller can list her goods for sale with online retailers or sell her goods through local consignment and vintage stores and other venues and marketplaces. She may also sell wholesale directly to traditional retailers, including large national retailers, who discover her goods in our marketplace or otherwise. We also compete with companies that sell software and services to small businesses, enabling an Etsy seller to sell from her own website or otherwise run her business independently of our platform. We are able to compete for Etsy sellers based on our brand awareness, the breadth of our online presence, the number and engagement of Etsy buyers, our Seller Services, our fees, the strength of our community and our values. \n \n We also compete with retailers for the attention of the Etsy buyer. An Etsy buyer has the choice of shopping with any online or offline retailer, whether large marketplaces or national retail chains or local consignment and vintage stores or other venues or marketplaces. We are able to compete for Etsy buyers based on the unique goods that Etsy sellers list in our marketplace, awareness of our brand, the person-to-person commerce experience, our reputation for authenticity, our mobile apps, ease of payment and the availability and reliability of our platform. \n \n Intellectual Property \n \n Protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important component of our success. We rely on intellectual property laws, primarily including trade secret, copyright and trademark laws in the United States and abroad, and we use confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights to protect our intellectual property. \n \n While we have obtained or applied for patent protection for some of our intellectual property, we generally do not rely on patents as a principal means of protecting intellectual property. We register domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and abroad. We also rely upon common law protection for certain trademarks. \n \n 115 \n \n Circumstances beyond our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. In addition, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our ability to compete and our operating results. \n \n Facilities \n \n Our headquarters are located in Brooklyn, New York where we occupy approximately 104,493 square feet under a lease that expires in 2016. We use these facilities for our principal administration, technology and development and engineering activities. Our European headquarters are located in Dublin, Ireland. \n \n In May 2014, we signed a lease for new corporate headquarters, also located in Brooklyn, which we expect to occupy in 2016. The lease covers two buildings totaling approximately 198,635 square feet and will expire approximately ten years from the later to occur of the two buildings\u0092 lease commencement dates. We expect that our new space will allow us to grow our local staff, will be LEED-certified and will support our efforts to reduce our environmental footprint. \n \n We also maintain offices in Hudson (New York), San Francisco, Berlin, Dublin, London, Paris, Melbourne and Toronto. \n \n We believe that our current facilities are suitable and adequate to meet our ongoing needs and that, if we require additional space, we will be able to obtain additional facilities. \n \n Government Regulation \n \n As with any company operating on the Internet, we grapple with a growing number of local, national and international laws and regulations. These laws are often complex, sometimes contradict other laws, and are frequently still evolving. Laws may be interpreted and enforced in different ways in various locations around the world, posing a significant challenge to our global business. For example, U.S. federal and state laws, EU directives, and other national laws govern the processing of payments, consumer protection and the privacy of consumer information; other laws define and regulate unfair and deceptive trade practices. Still other laws dictate when and how sales or other taxes must be collected. Laws of defamation apply online and vary by country. The growing regulation of e-commerce worldwide could impose additional compliance burdens and costs on us or on Etsy sellers, and could subject us to significant liability for any failure to comply. Additionally, because we operate internationally, we need to comply with various laws associated with doing business outside of the United States, including anti-money laundering, anti-corruption and export control laws. \n \n 116 \n \n Legal Matters \n \n From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings and subject to claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the results of legal proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe we are not currently party to any legal proceedings which, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. There can be no assurances that we will obtain a favorable outcome. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings can harm us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors. \n \n 117 \n \n Management \n \n Executive Officers and Directors \n \n Our executive officers and directors, and their ages and positions as of January 31, 2015, are listed below: \n \n Name Age Position(s) Executive Officers: Chad Dickerson 42 President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman Kristina Salen 43 Chief Financial Officer Jordan Breslow 59 General Counsel and Secretary Kellan Elliott-McCrea 37 Chief Technology Officer and Chief Architect Non-Employee Directors: James W.

In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a public company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors or any other board committee, accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries or be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries.

Our directors will be divided among the three classes as follows: \n \n \u0095 the Class I directors will be , and their terms will expire at our annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2016; \n \n \u0095 the Class II directors will be , and their terms will expire at our annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2017; and \n \n \u0095 the Class III directors will be , and their terms will expire at our annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2018. \n \n Directors in a particular class will be elected for three-year terms at our annual meeting of stockholders in the year in which their terms expire. As a result, only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. Each director\u0092s term continues until the election and qualification of his or her successor, or the earlier of his or her death, resignation or removal. \n \n Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that will be in effect after this offering provide that only our board of directors can fill vacant directorships, including newly created seats. Any additional directorships resulting from an increase in the authorized number of directors would be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class would consist of one-third of the authorized number of directors. \n \n The classification of our board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management.

We have granted stock option awards on an ad hoc basis to members of our board of directors who are not otherwise affiliated with us. In April 2014 we granted an option to purchase 253,294 shares of our common stock to M. Michele Burns in connection with her election to our board of directors. The option vests 25% when Ms. Burns completes 12 months of continuous service with us and then in equal monthly installments over the following 36 months of her service with us. We reimburse directors for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in attending board of directors and committee meetings. \n \n For services rendered during the year ended December 31, 2014, our non-employee directors received the following compensation: \n \n Name Option \n \n Awards \n \n ($)(1) Total \n \n ($) Fred Wilson \u0097 \u0097 James W.

Under this program, each new, non-employee director who joins our board of directors will be granted equity compensation (in the form of stock options or restricted stock units) upon the effective date of his or her election to our board of directors with a fair value (calculated in accordance with FASB \n \n 125 \n \n ASC Topic 718) at the time of grant equal to $350,000.

Historically, the base salaries of our executive officers have been reviewed on an ad hoc basis and adjusted only when our board of directors or compensation committee determines an adjustment is appropriate. In February 2014, Ms. Salen\u0092s salary was increased from her initial base salary of $275,000 to $300,000 in light of her performance in 2013 and her responsibilities. \n \n 127 \n \n Annual Cash Incentive Bonuses \n \n Prior to 2014, we did not have a regular annual cash incentive bonus program for our executive officers. In 2014, our compensation committee approved an annual cash incentive plan in which certain of our employees, including our named executive officers, participated. The bonus plan was funded based upon the satisfaction of company-wide Adjusted EBITDA margin and net revenue goals. Because we exceeded our Adjusted EBITDA margin goal, the bonus plan was funded above target. The target bonuses for our named executive officers for 2014, as a percentage of base salary, were 75% for Mr. Dickerson, 59% for Ms. Salen and 50% for Mr. Breslow, and the actual bonus payouts were 110% of target for Mr. Dickerson and 121% of target for Ms. Salen and Mr. Breslow. The individual bonus payments were approved by our compensation committee and our board of directors with input from Mr. Dickerson for the other named executive officers. \n \n Long-Term Equity Incentive Compensation \n \n We grant stock options to our employees, including our named executive officers, as the long-term equity incentive component of our compensation program. Stock options allow employees to purchase shares of our common stock at a price no less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and are generally granted to employees in connection with their commencement of employment. Our board of directors or compensation committee from time to time also grants stock options to certain employees who have had a long tenure at Etsy, who have taken on significant new responsibilities or as a reward for superior performance. Employee stock options generally vest 25% when an employee completes 12 months of service with us and then in equal monthly installments over the following 36 months of service with us. None of our named executive officers received stock options in 2014. \n \n In January 2015, we granted an option to purchase 600,000 shares of our common stock to Mr. Dickerson and an option to purchase 290,000 shares of our common stock to Ms. Salen. The options vest 25% upon Mr. Dickerson\u0092s or Ms. Salen\u0092s 12 months of continuous service from January 30, 2015 and then in equal monthly installments over his or her following 36 months of service with us. \n \n For information regarding the vesting acceleration provisions applicable to the options held by our named executive officers, see \u0093\u0097Change in Control Benefits\u0094 below. \n \n Employee Benefits and Perquisites \n \n Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in our health and welfare plans to the same extent as other full-time employees generally. We generally do not provide our named executive officers with perquisites or other personal benefits. From time to time, however, we provide relocation benefits to new executive officers. \n \n 128 \n \n Outstanding Equity Awards at 2014 Fiscal Year-End \n \n The following table sets forth information regarding unexercised stock options held by each of our named executive officers as of December 31, 2014. \n \n Stock Option Awards Name Number of Securities \n \n Underlying Unexercised \n \n Options Exercisable(#) Number of Securities \n \n Underlying Unexercised \n \n Options Unexercisable(#) Option \n \n Exercise \n \n Price ($) Option \n \n Expiration \n \n Date Chad Dickerson 600,000 350,000 (1) 1.15 7/28/2021 1,713,876 1,521,702 (2) 2.38 7/16/2022 Kristina Salen 697,515 824,336 (3) 2.38 2/3/2023 Jordan Breslow 192,345 517,852 (4) 3.11 12/10/2023 \n \n (1) This stock option vested 25% on July 19, 2012, with the remainder vesting in 36 equal monthly installments thereafter if Mr. Dickerson remains continuously employed with us on each vesting date. \n \n (2) This stock option vested 25% on June 11, 2013, with the remainder vesting in 36 equal monthly installments thereafter if Mr. Dickerson remains continuously employed with us on each vesting date. \n \n (3) This stock option vested 25% on February 3, 2014, with the remainder vesting in 36 equal monthly installments thereafter if Ms. Salen remains continuously employed with us on each vesting date. \n \n (4) This stock option vested 25% on November 11, 2014, with the remainder vesting in 36 equal monthly installments thereafter if Mr. Breslow remains continuously employed with us on each vesting date. \n \n For information regarding the vesting acceleration provisions applicable to the options held by our named executive officers, see \u0093\u0097Change in Control Benefits\u0094 below. \n \n Employment Agreements \n \n A summary of the material terms of the employment letter agreements with our named executive officers and other arrangements providing benefits in connection with such officers\u0092 termination of employment or in connection with a change in control is below. \n \n Chad Dickerson \n \n In August 2011, we entered into an employment letter agreement with Mr. Dickerson in connection with his promotion to chief executive officer.

The named executive officer will also be entitled to receive reimbursement for healthcare continuation coverage for the lesser of the number of months in the severance period or until healthcare continuation coverage ends or the named executive officer becomes eligible for substantially equivalent coverage.

Optionees may pay the exercise price in cash or, with the consent of the compensation committee and as set forth in the applicable option grant agreement: \n \n \u0095 with shares of common stock that the optionee already owns; \n \n \u0095 by an immediate sale of shares through a broker approved by us; \n \n \u0095 through a net exercise procedure; or \n \n \u0095 by other methods permitted by applicable law. \n \n An optionee who exercises a stock appreciation right receives the increase in value of our common stock over the exercise price. The exercise price for stock appreciation rights may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. The settlement value of a stock appreciation right may be paid in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of these forms of payment. \n \n Options and stock appreciation rights vest as determined by the compensation committee at the time of grant. In most cases, they will vest over a four-year period following the date of grant. Options and stock appreciation rights expire at the time determined by the compensation committee but in no event more than ten years after they are granted. These awards generally expire earlier if the participant\u0092s service terminates earlier. No participant may be granted stock options and stock appreciation rights covering more than 2,000,000 shares (or stock options and/or stock appreciation rights covering more than 4,000,000 shares for a new hire) in any fiscal year. \n \n 133 \n \n Restricted Shares and Stock Units. Restricted shares and stock units may be awarded under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan in return for any lawful consideration, and participants who receive restricted shares or stock units generally are not required to pay cash for their awards. In general, these awards will be subject to vesting. Vesting may be based on length of service, the attainment of performance-based goals or a combination of both, as determined by the compensation committee. No participant may be granted restricted share awards and stock units covering more than 1,500,000 shares (or 3,000,000 restricted shares and/or restricted stock units for a new hire) in any fiscal year. This annual limit is in addition to any stock options and stock appreciation rights the participant may receive during a calendar year. Settlement of vested stock units may be made in the form of cash, shares of common stock or a combination of these forms of payment. The permissible performance goals to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code are listed under \u0093\u0097Performance Goals.\u0094 \n \n Performance Cash Awards. Performance cash awards may be granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan that qualify as performance-based compensation that is not subject to the income tax deductibility limitations imposed by Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, if the award is approved by our compensation committee and the grant or vesting of the award is tied solely to the attainment of performance goals during a designated performance period. The permissible performance goals to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code are listed under \u0093\u0097Performance Goals.\u0094 No participant may be paid more than $1,500,000 in cash (or $3,000,000 for a new hire) in any fiscal year pursuant to a performance cash award granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. \n \n Performance Goals. Performance goals for the grant or vesting of awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan may be based on any one of, or combination of, the following: budget performance, buyer acquisition, retention and/or growth, cash flow, cash flow return on investment, comparisons with various stock market indices, costs and expenses (including reduction of both), earnings or earnings per share (including earnings before taxes, earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including adjusted measures), employee satisfaction and/or retention, free cash flow or free cash flow per share, gross margin, gross profits, headcount, market share, net income (before or after taxes), operating income or EBIT (Earnings before Interest and Taxes) on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis, operating or EBIT margin, return on assets, investment or capital employed, return on equity or average stockholders\u0092 equity, revenue (gross or net), GMS, seller acquisition, retention and/or growth, member satisfaction, stockholders\u0092 equity, stock price return relative to market indices and/or peer group, total stockholder return and working capital. \n \n Any of the above metrics may be measured either in absolute terms, compared to any incremental increase or decrease or compared to results of a peer group, to market performance indicators or to market indices. \n \n To the extent a performance award is not intended to comply with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the compensation committee may select other measures of performance. \n \n 134 \n \n Corporate Transactions. In the event we are a party to a merger, consolidation or certain change in control transactions, outstanding awards granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, and all shares acquired under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, will be subject to the terms of the definitive transaction agreement (or, if there is no such agreement, as determined by our compensation committee). Unless an award agreement provides otherwise, such treatment may include any of the following with respect to each outstanding award: \n \n \u0095 the continuation, assumption or substitution of an award by us or the acquiror or surviving corporation; \n \n \u0095 the cancellation of the unvested portion of an award without payment of any consideration; \n \n \u0095 the cancellation of the vested portion of options and stock appreciation rights in exchange for a payment equal to the excess, if any, of the value that a holder of a share of our common stock receives in the transaction over the exercise or purchase price of such award; \n \n \u0095 the cancellation of outstanding stock units (whether vested or unvested) in exchange for a payment equal to the value that a holder of a share of our common stock receives in such transaction; or \n \n \u0095 the assignment of any repurchase or reacquisition rights held by us to the surviving or acquiring entity. \n \n The compensation committee is not required to treat all awards, or portions thereof, in the same manner. \n \n The compensation committee has the discretion to provide that an award granted under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will vest on an accelerated basis if we are subject to a change in control or if the participant is subject to an involuntary termination, either at the time such award is granted or afterwards. \n \n A change in control includes: \n \n \u0095 any person acquiring beneficial ownership of more than 50% of our total voting power; \n \n \u0095 the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets; \n \n \u0095 our merger or consolidation after which our voting securities represent 50% or less of the total voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity; or \n \n \u0095 individuals who are members of our board of directors or individuals who were approved or recommended by members of our board of directors cease to constitute a majority of our board of directors over a 12-month period. \n \n Changes in Capitalization. In the event that there is a specified type of change in the capital structure of our common stock, such as a stock split, reverse stock split or dividend paid in common stock, proportionate adjustments will automatically be made to the kind and maximum number of shares: \n \n \u0095 reserved for issuance under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan; \n \n 135 \n \n \u0095 by which the share reserve may increase automatically each year; \n \n \u0095 that may be granted to a participant in a year (as established under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan pursuant to Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code); \n \n \u0095 that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options; and \n \n \u0095 covered by each outstanding option, stock appreciation right and stock unit; \n \n as well as the exercise price applicable to each outstanding option and stock appreciation right and the repurchase price, if any, applicable to restricted shares. \n \n In the event that there is a declaration of an extraordinary dividend payable in a form other than our common stock in an amount that has a material effect on the price of our common stock, a recapitalization, a spin-off or a similar occurrence, the compensation committee may make such adjustments as it deems appropriate, in its sole discretion. \n \n Amendments or Termination. Our board of directors may amend or terminate the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan at any time. If our board of directors amends the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, it does not need to ask for stockholder approval of the amendment unless required by applicable law, regulation or rules. The 2015 Equity Incentive Plan will continue in effect for ten years from the later of its adoption date or the date of approval of the latest share increase, unless our board of directors decides to terminate the plan earlier. \n \n Forfeiture. Awards under the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan are subject to recovery to the extent required by any law, government regulation, stock exchange listing requirement or company policy. \n \n 2006 Stock Plan \n \n Our board of directors adopted our 2006 Stock Plan in May 2006, and our stockholders approved it in June 2006. The most recent amendment to the 2006 Stock Plan was adopted by our board of directors in December 2013, and we obtained stockholder approval of that amendment in January 2014. No further awards will be made under our 2006 Stock Plan after this offering. The awards outstanding after this offering under the 2006 Stock Plan will continue to be governed by their existing terms. \n \n Share Reserve. We have reserved 48,505,935 shares of our common stock for issuance under the 2006 Stock Plan, all of which may be issued as incentive stock options. In general, if options or shares awarded under the 2006 Stock Plan are reacquired or repurchased by us or otherwise forfeited by a 2006 Stock Plan participant, then those shares or option shares will again become available for awards under the 2006 Stock Plan. \n \n Administration. Our board of directors administered the 2006 Stock Plan before this offering, and the compensation committee will administer the 2006 Stock Plan after this offering. Before this offering, our board of directors had, and after this offering, our compensation committee will have, complete discretion to make all decisions relating to our 2006 Stock Plan. \n \n 136 \n \n Eligibility. Employees, members of our board of directors who are not employees and consultants are eligible to participate in our 2006 Stock Plan. \n \n Types of Award. Our 2006 Stock Plan provides for the following types of awards: \n \n \u0095 incentive and nonstatutory stock options; and \n \n \u0095 direct award or sale of shares of our common stock, including restricted shares (subject to a right of repurchase by us upon the participant\u0092s termination with respect to unvested shares). \n \n Options and restricted shares vest at the times determined by our board of directors. Both options and restricted shares generally vest over a four-year period following the date of grant. Options expire not more than 10 years after they are granted but generally expire earlier if the participant\u0092s service terminates earlier. \n \n Options. The exercise price for options granted under the 2006 Stock Plan may not be less than 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the option grant date. Participants may pay the exercise price of options, or the purchase price of shares, by using cash or cash equivalents. In addition, at the discretion of our board of directors, payment may be made by using: \n \n \u0095 a full-recourse promissory note, against which the purchased shares are pledged as security for payment of the principal amount of, and interest on, the note; \n \n \u0095 shares of common stock that the optionee already owns; \n \n \u0095 an immediate sale of the option shares through a broker designated by us; \n \n \u0095 in the case of a sale of shares, services rendered to us; or \n \n \u0095 any other form of payment permitted by applicable law. \n \n Restricted Stock. We may grant or sell restricted stock to participants under the 2006 Stock Plan. \n \n Change in Control. In the event we are a party to a merger or consolidation, outstanding options granted under the 2006 Stock Plan will be subject to the terms of the definitive transaction agreement. Such treatment shall include any of the following: \n \n \u0095 the continuation, assumption or substitution of the option by us or the acquiror or surviving corporation; \n \n \u0095 the full exercisability of outstanding options and full vesting of the common shares subject to options, followed by cancellation of such options; or \n \n \u0095 the cancellation of the outstanding options in exchange for a payment equal to the excess, if any, of the value that a holder of a share of our common stock receives in the transaction over the exercise price of the option. \n \n 137 \n \n Changes in Capitalization. In the event that there is a specified type of change in the capital structure of our common stock, such as a stock split, reverse stock split or dividend paid in common stock, proportionate adjustments will automatically be made to the kind and maximum number of shares: \n \n \u0095 reserved for issuance under the 2006 Stock Plan; \n \n \u0095 that may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options; and \n \n \u0095 covered by each outstanding option; \n \n as well as the exercise price applicable to each outstanding option. \n \n In the event that there is a declaration of an extraordinary dividend payable in a form other than our common stock in an amount that has a material effect on the price of our common stock, a recapitalization, a spin-off or a similar occurrence, the compensation committee may make such adjustments as it deems appropriate, in its sole discretion. \n \n Amendments or Termination. Our board of directors may amend or terminate the 2006 Stock Plan at any time. If our board of directors amends the 2006 Stock Plan, it does not need to ask for stockholder approval of the amendment unless the amendment increases the number of shares available for issuance, materially changes the class of persons eligible to receive incentive stock options or is otherwise required by applicable law. The 2006 Stock Plan will continue in effect for ten years from the later of its adoption date or the date of approval of the latest share increase, unless our board of directors decides to terminate the plan earlier. \n \n 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan \n \n General. Our board of directors adopted our 2015 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or our ESPP, in , and our stockholders approved it in . The ESPP will become effective as of the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part. Our ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. \n \n Share Reserve. We have reserved shares of our common stock for issuance under the ESPP. The number of shares reserved for issuance under the ESPP will automatically be increased on the first business day of each of our fiscal years, commencing in 2016, by a number equal to the smallest of: \n \n \u0095 shares; \n \n \u0095 % of the shares of common stock outstanding on the last business day of the prior fiscal year; or \n \n \u0095 the number of shares determined by our board of directors. \n \n 138 \n \n The number of shares reserved under the ESPP will automatically be adjusted in the event of a stock split, stock dividend, extraordinary dividend payable in a form other than our common stock in an amount that has a material effect on the price of our common stock or a reverse stock split (including an adjustment to the per-purchase period share limit). \n \n Administration. The compensation committee will administer the ESPP. \n \n Eligibility. All of our employees are eligible to participate if we employ them for 20 or more hours per week and for more than five months per year. Eligible employees may begin participating in the ESPP at the start of any offering period. \n \n Offering Periods. Each offering period will last a number of months determined by the compensation committee, not to exceed 27 months. A new offering period will begin periodically, as determined by the compensation committee. Offering periods may overlap or may be consecutive. Unless otherwise determined by the compensation committee, two offering periods of six months\u0092 duration will begin in each year on January 1 and July 1. However, our compensation committee has not yet determined when to commence operation of the ESPP, so we currently do not expect an offering period to commence in July 2015. \n \n Amount of Contributions. Our ESPP permits each eligible employee to purchase common stock through payroll deductions. Each employee\u0092s payroll deductions may not exceed 15% of the employee\u0092s cash compensation. Each participant may purchase up to the number of shares determined by the compensation committee on any purchase date, not to exceed shares. The value of the shares purchased in any calendar year may not exceed $25,000. Participants may withdraw their contributions at any time before the date 10 days before stock is purchased. \n \n Purchase Price. The price of each share of common stock purchased under our ESPP will not be less than 85% of the lower of the fair market value per share of common stock on the first day of the applicable offering period or the fair market value per share of common stock on the purchase date. \n \n Other Provisions. Employees may end their participation in the ESPP at any time. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with us. If we experience a change in control, our ESPP will end and shares will be purchased with the payroll deductions accumulated to date by participating employees. Our board of directors or our compensation committee may amend or terminate the ESPP at any time. If our board of directors amends the ESPP, it does not need to ask for stockholder approval of the amendment unless the amendment increases the number of shares available for issuance, extends the term of the ESPP or is otherwise required by applicable law. The ESPP will continue in effect for twenty years from its adoption date unless our board of directors decides to terminate the ESPP earlier. \n \n 139 \n \n Management Cash Incentive Plan \n \n Our board of directors adopted the Management Cash Incentive Plan, or the Bonus Plan, in March 2015 and our stockholders approved it in 2015. The Bonus Plan became effective upon adoption by our board of directors. \n \n General. The Bonus Plan is intended to motivate participants to achieve performance goals through cash incentive awards and is intended to permit awards that meet the requirements of the performance-based compensation exemption from Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code to the extent that it is applicable to us and the Bonus Plan. \n \n Administration. Our compensation committee has the authority to administer and interpret the Bonus Plan, including the authority to determine which employees shall be granted awards, the terms and conditions of awards and achievement of performance goals. \n \n Performance Criteria. To the extent Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code is applicable to us and an award under the Bonus Plan is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, our compensation committee establishes the performance goal or goals applicable to that award by the 90th day of the performance period (and no later than the date on which 25% of the performance period has lapsed). To the extent Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code is applicable to us and an award under the Bonus Plan is intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, the performance criteria will be based on any one of, or combination of, the following: budget performance, buyer acquisition, retention and/or growth, cash flow, cash flow return on investment, comparisons with various stock market indices, costs and expenses (including reduction of both), earnings or earnings per share (including earnings before taxes, earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including adjusted measures), employee satisfaction and/or retention, free cash flow or free cash flow per share, gross margin, gross profits, headcount, market share, net income (before or after taxes), operating income or EBIT (Earnings before Interest and Taxes) on a GAAP or non-GAAP basis, operating or EBIT margin, return on assets, investment or capital employed, return on equity or average stockholders\u0092 equity, revenue (gross or net), GMS, seller acquisition, retention and/or growth, member satisfaction, stockholders\u0092 equity, stock price return relative to market indices and/or peer group, total stockholder return and working capital. \n \n Any of the above metrics may be measured either in absolute terms, compared to any incremental increase or decrease or compared to results of a peer group, to market performance indicators or to market indices. \n \n Our compensation committee can establish other performance goals for any award under the Bonus Plan not intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. \n \n 140 \n \n Maximum Award; Discretion. The maximum award amount payable under the Bonus Plan is $7,500,000. Our compensation committee has the discretion to reduce awards under the Bonus Plan for any reason or increase awards that are not intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code, up to the maximum award amount. Awards intended to qualify as performance-based compensation under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code cannot be increased beyond the award achieved based on actual performance. \n \n Forfeiture. Awards under the Bonus Plan are subject to recovery to the extent required by any law, government regulation, stock exchange listing requirement or company policy. \n \n 141 \n \n Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions \n \n In addition to the compensation arrangements with directors and executive officers described under \u0093Executive Compensation\u0094 and \u0093Management\u0094 and the registration rights described under \u0093Description of Capital Stock\u0097Registration Rights,\u0094 the following is a description of each transaction since January 1, 2012 and each currently proposed transaction in which: \n \n \u0095 we have been or are to be a participant; \n \n \u0095 the amount involved exceeds or will exceed $120,000; and \n \n \u0095 any of our directors, executive officers or beneficial holders of more than 5% of our capital stock, or any immediate family member of, or person sharing the household with, any of these individuals (other than tenants or employees), had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. \n \n Equity Financings \n \n Series F Preferred Stock \n \n In May 2012, we sold an aggregate of 11,594,203 shares of our Series F preferred stock at a purchase price of $3.45 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $40,000,000.

Since January 1, 2012, we have waived or assigned our right of first refusal in connection with the sale of certain shares of our capital stock, resulting in the purchase of such shares by certain holders of more than 5% of our capital stock in a series of transactions. Since January 2014, pursuant to agreements entered into in January 2014, as amended most recently in May 2014, we were obligated to assign all of our contractual rights of first refusal to Tiger Global PIP VII and Tiger Global Private Investment Partners VIII, L.P., or the Tiger Global funds, which funds collectively hold more than 5% of our capital stock, and two principals of the Tiger Global funds until the earlier of December 31, 2014 and such time as certain conditions have been satisfied.

We intend to adopt a written related person transaction policy to be effective upon the completion of this offering. Under our related person transaction policy, our management will be required to submit any related person transaction not previously approved or ratified by our audit committee to our audit committee. In approving or rejecting the proposed transactions, our audit committee will take into account the relevant facts and circumstances and will approve only those transactions that are in, or are not inconsistent with, our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders. \n \n 145 \n \n Although we have not had a written policy prior to this offering for the review and approval of related person transactions, our board of directors has historically reviewed and approved any transaction where a director or officer had a financial interest, including the transactions described above. Prior to approving such a transaction, the material facts as to a director\u0092s or officer\u0092s relationship or interest as to the agreement or transaction were disclosed to our board of directors, which took take this information into account when evaluating the transaction and determining whether such transaction was fair to us and in the best interest of our stockholders. \n \n 146 \n \n Principal and Selling Stockholders \n \n The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock as of January 31, 2015, and as adjusted to reflect the sale of common stock offered by us and the selling stockholders in this offering, for: \n \n \u0095 each of our named executive officers; \n \n \u0095 each of our directors; \n \n \u0095 all of our executive officers and directors as a group; \n \n \u0095 each stockholder, or group of affiliated persons, known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock; and \n \n \u0095 each of the selling stockholders. \n \n We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC, which generally define beneficial ownership to include any shares over which a person exercises sole or shared voting or investment power. Such determination is not necessarily indicative of beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community property laws. \n \n Applicable percentage ownership is based on 196,381,160 shares of common stock outstanding at January 31, 2015, after giving effect to the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock as of that date into an aggregate of 106,896,493 shares of our common stock, which will occur immediately prior to the completion of this offering. For purposes of computing percentage ownership after this offering, we have assumed the issuance and sale by us of shares of common stock in this offering and that the underwriters will not exercise their option to purchase additional shares. In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed to be outstanding all shares of common stock subject to options or warrants held by that person or entity that are currently exercisable or that will become exercisable within 60 days of January 31, 2015. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. \n \n 147 \n \n Unless otherwise indicated, the address of each beneficial owner listed in the table below is c/o Etsy, Inc., 55 Washington Street, Suite 512, Brooklyn, New York 11201. \n \n Beneficial \n \n Ownership Prior to \n \n this Offering Shares Being \n \n Offered Beneficial Ownership \n \n After this Offering Name of Beneficial Owner Number Percent Number Percent Named Executive Officers and Directors: Jordan Breslow(1) 236,732 * James W.

Under Delaware law, we can only pay dividends either out of \u0093surplus\u0094 or out of the current or the immediately preceding year\u0092s net profits. Surplus is defined as the excess, if any, at any given time, of the total assets of a corporation over its total liabilities and statutory \n \n 150 \n \n capital. The value of a corporation\u0092s assets can be measured in a number of ways and may not necessarily equal their book value. See \u0093Dividend Policy\u0094 for more information. \n \n Voting Rights \n \n The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Stockholders do not have the ability to cumulate votes for the election of directors. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws that will be in effect upon completion of this offering will provide for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of approximately equal size, each serving staggered three-year terms. Only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders, with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective three-year terms. \n \n No Preemptive or Similar Rights \n \n Our common stock is not entitled to preemptive rights and is not subject to conversion, redemption or sinking fund provisions. \n \n Right to Receive Liquidation Distributions \n \n Upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, the assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders are distributable ratably among the holders of our common stock, subject to prior satisfaction of all outstanding debt and liabilities and the preferential rights and payment of liquidation preferences, if any, on any outstanding shares of preferred stock. \n \n Preferred Stock \n \n Upon the completion of this offering, no shares of preferred stock will be outstanding. However, we will be authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law, to issue preferred stock in one or more series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each series, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each series and any of its qualifications, limitations or restrictions. Our board of directors also can increase or decrease the number of shares of any series, but not below the number of shares of that series then outstanding, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. Our board of directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, while providing flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could, among other things, have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock. We have no current plan to issue any shares of preferred stock. \n \n 151 \n \n Options \n \n As of December 31, 2014, we had options to purchase 23,050,594 shares of our common stock outstanding under our 2006 Stock Plan. Subsequent to December 31, 2014, we granted options to purchase 2,037,490 shares of our common stock under our 2006 Stock Plan. \n \n Warrants \n \n As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding immediately exercisable warrants to purchase (i) an aggregate of 11,373 shares of our Series C preferred stock at an exercise price of $2.67 per share, or the Series C warrant, (ii) an aggregate of 24,510 shares of our Series D preferred stock at an exercise price of $6.63 per share, or the Series D warrant, and (iii) an aggregate of 4,723 shares of our Series E preferred stock at an exercise price of $15.88 per share, or the Series E warrant. Immediately following this offering, the Series C warrant will be exercisable for 113,730 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.267 per share, the Series D warrant will be exercisable for 245,100 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.663 per share and the Series E warrant will be exercisable for 47,230 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $1.588 per share. The Series C warrant expires on November 14, 2017. The Series D warrant expires on the later of May 15, 2015 and five years from the date of this offering. The Series E warrant expires on the later of August 9, 2017 and five years from the date of this offering. \n \n Registration Rights \n \n Following the completion of this offering, holders of an aggregate of shares of our common stock will have registration rights. These shares are referred to as registrable securities. The holders of these registrable securities possess registration rights pursuant to the terms of our sixth amended and restated investor rights agreement dated May 1, 2012, as amended, or investor rights agreement, which terms are described in additional detail below. We originally entered into the investor rights agreement in connection with our Series A-1 preferred stock financing and amended it mostly recently on May 2, 2014. \n \n Demand Registration Rights \n \n Under our investor rights agreement, at any time commencing on the date that is 180 days following the effective date of our first registration statement, upon the written request of the holders of not less than 30% of the registrable securities then outstanding that we file a registration statement under the Securities Act with an anticipated aggregate price to the public of at least $7.5 million, we will be obligated to use our commercially reasonable efforts to register the sale of all registrable securities that holders may request in writing to be registered within 20 days of the mailing of a notice by us to all holders of such registration. We are required to effect no more than two registration statements that are declared or ordered effective, subject to certain exceptions. We may postpone the filing of a registration statement for up to 120 days twice in any 12-month period if in the good faith judgment of our board of directors such registration would \n \n 152 \n \n be seriously detrimental to us, and we are not required to effect the filing of a registration statement during the period beginning 90 days prior to our good faith estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date 180 days following the effective date of, a registration initiated by us. \n \n Piggyback Registration Rights \n \n If we register any of our securities for public sale, we will be obligated to use all commercially reasonable efforts to register all registrable securities that the holders of such securities request in writing be registered within 10 days of mailing of notice by us to all holders of the proposed registration. However, this right does not apply to a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans, a registration relating to the offer and sale of debt securities or a registration relating to a corporate reorganization or other transaction under Rule 145 of the Securities Act. The managing underwriter of any underwritten offering will have the right to limit, due to marketing reasons, the number of shares registered by these holders to 25% of the total shares covered by the registration statement, except for in this offering, in which these holders may be excluded entirely if the underwriters determine that the sale of their shares may jeopardize the success of the offering. \n \n Form S-3 Registration Rights \n \n At any time commencing on the date that is 180 days following the effective date of our first registration statement, the holders of the registrable securities can request that we register all or a portion of their shares on Form S-3 if we are eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3 and the aggregate price to the public of the shares offered is at least $3 million. We are required to file no more than two registration statements on Form S-3 per 12-month period upon exercise of these rights, subject to certain exceptions. We may postpone the filing of a registration statement for up to 120 days twice in any 12-month period if in the good faith judgment of our board of directors such registration would be seriously detrimental to us, and we are not required to effect the filing of a registration statement during the period beginning 90 days prior to our good faith estimate of the date of the filing of, and ending on a date 180 days following the effective date of, a registration initiated by us. \n \n Registration Expenses \n \n We will pay all expenses (other than underwriting discounts, selling commissions and stock transfer taxes) of the holders incurred in connection with each of the registrations described above. However, we will not pay for any expenses of any demand or Form S-3 registration if the request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the holders of a majority of the registrable securities to be registered, subject to limited exceptions. \n \n Termination of Registration Rights \n \n The registration rights described above will survive this offering and will terminate as to any stockholder at such time as all of such stockholder\u0092s securities (together with any affiliate of the stockholder with whom \n \n 153 \n \n such stockholder must aggregate its sales) could be sold pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act, but in any event no later than the five-year anniversary of this offering. \n \n Anti-Takeover Provisions \n \n Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law \n \n Upon the completion of this offering, we will be governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regulating corporate takeovers. This section prevents some Delaware corporations from engaging, under some circumstances, in a business combination. A business combination includes a merger or sale of at least 10% of the corporation\u0092s assets with any interested stockholder, meaning a stockholder who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own 15% or more of the corporation\u0092s outstanding voting stock, unless: \n \n \u0095 the transaction is approved by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder; or \n \n \u0095 subsequent to such time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder the business combination is approved by the board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder. \n \n A Delaware corporation may \u0093opt out\u0094 of these provisions with an express provision in its original certificate of incorporation or an express provision in its certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws resulting from a stockholders\u0092 amendment approved by a majority of the outstanding voting shares. We have not opted out of these provisions. As a result, mergers or other takeover or change in control attempts of us may be discouraged or prevented. \n \n Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaw Provisions \n \n Upon the completion of this offering, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws will include a number of provisions that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control of our management team, including the following: \n \n Board of Directors Vacancies. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will authorize only our board of directors to fill vacant directorships. In addition, the number of directors constituting our board of directors will be set only by resolution adopted by a majority vote of our entire board of directors. These provisions will prevent a stockholder from increasing the size of our board of directors and gaining control of our board of directors by filling the resulting vacancies with its own nominees. \n \n Classified Board. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will provide that our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors, each of whom will hold office for a three-year term. In addition, directors may only be removed from our board of directors for \n \n 154 \n \n cause and only by the approval of our then outstanding shares of our common stock. The existence of a classified board could delay a successful tender offeror from obtaining majority control of our board of directors, and the prospect of that delay might deter a potential offeror. \n \n Stockholder Action; Special Meeting of Stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that stockholders will not be able to take action by written consent, and will only be able to take action at annual or special meetings of our stockholders. Stockholders will not be permitted to cumulate their votes for the election of directors. Our amended and restated bylaws will further provide that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by a majority vote of our entire board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or our chief executive officer. \n \n Advance Notice Requirements for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations. Our amended and restated bylaws will provide advance notice procedures for stockholders seeking to bring business before our annual meeting of stockholders or to nominate candidates for election as directors at any meeting of stockholders. Our amended and restated bylaws will also specify certain requirements regarding the form and content of a stockholder\u0092s notice. These provisions may preclude our stockholders from bringing matters before our annual meeting of stockholders or from making nominations for directors at our meetings of stockholders. \n \n Issuance of Undesignated Preferred Stock. Our board of directors will have the authority, without further action by the holders of common stock, to issue up to shares of undesignated preferred stock with rights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock will enable our board of directors to render more difficult or to discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise. \n \n Choice of Forum \n \n Upon the completion of this offering, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u0092 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. \n \n 155 \n \n Transfer Agent and Registrar \n \n Upon the completion of this offering, the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock will be American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC. The transfer agent\u0092s address is 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219, and its telephone number is (800) 937-5449. \n \n Listing \n \n We intend to apply to have our common stock listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u0093ETSY.\u0094 \n \n 156 \n \n Shares Available for Future Sale \n \n Before this offering, there has not been a public market for shares of our common stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, in the public market following this offering or the possibility of these sales occurring could cause the prevailing market price for our common stock to fall or impair our ability to raise equity capital in the future. \n \n Following this offering, we will have outstanding shares of our common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Of these outstanding shares, all of the shares of common stock sold in this offering will be freely tradable, except that any shares purchased in this offering by our affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, can only be sold in compliance with Rule 144. \n \n The remaining shares of common stock that are not sold in this offering will be \u0093restricted securities,\u0094 as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. These restricted securities are eligible for public sale only if they are registered under the Securities Act or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rule 144 or Rule 701 under the Securities Act, which are summarized below. \n \n In addition, all of our executive officers and directors and the holders of substantially all of our capital stock are subject to lock-up agreements with us or the underwriters of this offering that restrict the stockholders\u0092 ability to transfer shares, subject to specific exceptions, of our common stock for periods of at least 180 days, and for a portion of the shares, 270 and 360 days from the date of this prospectus, as described below. As a result of these agreements and the provisions of our investors\u0092 rights agreement described above under \u0093Description of Capital Stock\u0097Registration Rights,\u0094 subject to the provisions of Rule 144 or Rule 701, shares will be available for sale in the public market as follows: \n \n \u0095 beginning on the date of this prospectus, the shares sold in this offering will be immediately available for sale in the public market; \n \n \u0095 beginning 181 days after the date of this prospectus, up to an aggregate of additional shares will become eligible for sale in the public market, of which shares will be held by affiliates and subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below; \n \n \u0095 beginning 271 days after the date of this prospectus, up to an aggregate of additional shares will become eligible for sale in the public market, of which shares will be held by affiliates and subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below; \n \n \u0095 beginning 361 days after the date of this prospectus, up to an aggregate of additional shares will become eligible for sale in the public market, of which shares will be held by affiliates and subject to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below; \n \n 157 \n \n \u0095 the remainder of the shares will be eligible for sale in the public market from time to time thereafter, subject in some cases to the volume and other restrictions of Rule 144, as described below. \n \n Lock-Up Agreements \n \n Our executive officers, directors and stockholders holding substantially all of our outstanding capital stock are subject to lock-up agreements with the underwriters of this offering that restrict the stockholders\u0092 ability to transfer shares of our common stock, subject to certain exceptions, for periods of at least 180 days, and for a portion of the shares, 270 and 360 days from the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. In addition, substantially all other holders of our common stock, options and warrants have previously entered into lock-up agreements with us not to sell or otherwise transfer any of their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of common stock for a period that extends until 181 days after the date of this prospectus. \n \n See \u0093Underwriting\u0094 for a more complete description of the lock-up agreements with the underwriters. \n \n Rule 144 \n \n In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, a person who has beneficially owned shares of our restricted common stock for at least six months would be entitled to sell their securities provided that such person is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates at the time of, or at any time during the 90 days preceding, a sale, and we are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, for at least 90 days before the sale. In addition, under Rule 144, any person who is not an affiliate of ours and has held their shares for at least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other than one of our affiliates, would be entitled to sell an unlimited number of shares immediately upon the completion of this offering without regard to whether current public information about us is available. Persons who have beneficially owned shares of our restricted common stock for at least six months but who are our affiliates at the time of, or any time during the 90 days preceding, a sale, would be subject to additional restrictions, by which such person would be entitled to sell within any three-month period only a number of securities that does not exceed the greater of either of the following: \n \n \u0095 1% of the number of common shares then outstanding, which will equal approximately shares immediately after this offering assuming no exercise of the underwriters\u0092 option to purchase additional shares, based on the number of common shares outstanding as of December 31, 2014; or \n \n \u0095 the average weekly trading volume of our common shares during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to the sale; \n \n provided, in each case, that we are subject to the Exchange Act periodic reporting requirements for at least 90 days before the sale. Such sales both by affiliates and by non-affiliates must also comply with the manner of sale, current public information and notice provisions of Rule 144. \n \n 158 \n \n Rule 701 \n \n Any of our service providers who purchased shares under a written compensatory plan or contract prior to this offering may be entitled to rely on the resale provisions of Rule 701. Rule 701, as currently in effect, permits resales of shares, including by affiliates, in reliance upon Rule 144 but without compliance with certain restrictions, including the holding period requirement, of Rule 144. Rule 701 further provides that non-affiliates may sell such shares in reliance on Rule 144 without having to comply with the public information, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144. All holders of Rule 701 shares are required to wait until 90 days after the date of this prospectus before selling such shares if such resale is done under Rule 701. All Rule 701 shares are, however, subject to lock-up agreements and will only become eligible for sale upon the expiration of these lock-up agreements. \n \n Registration Rights \n \n Upon completion of this offering, the holders of shares of our common stock will have registration rights. See \u0093Description of Capital Stock\u0097Registration Rights.\u0094 All such shares are covered by lock-up agreements. Following the expiration of the lock-up period, registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the Securities Act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration, except for shares purchased by our affiliates. \n \n Form S-8 Registration Statements \n \n We intend to file a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act covering all of the shares of common stock subject to options outstanding, as well as reserved for future issuance, under our stock plans. We expect to file this registration statement as soon as practicable after this offering. However, none of the shares registered on Form S-8 will be eligible for resale until the expiration of the lock-up agreements to which they are subject. \n \n 159 \n \n Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations for Non-U.S. Holders of Common Stock \n \n The following is a discussion of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations with respect to the ownership and disposition of shares of common stock applicable to non-U.S. holders who acquire such shares in this offering and hold such shares as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u0093Code\u0094) (generally, property held for investment). For purposes of this discussion, a \u0093non-U.S. holder\u0094 means a beneficial owner of our common stock (other than an entity or arrangement that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) that is not, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, any of the following: \n \n \u0095 a citizen or resident of the United States; \n \n \u0095 a corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia, or any other corporation treated as such; \n \n \u0095 an estate, the income of which is includable in gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or \n \n \u0095 a trust if (i) a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more \u0093U.S. persons,\u0094 as defined under the Code, have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (ii) such trust has made a valid election to be treated as a U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \n \n This discussion is based on current provisions of the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial opinions, published positions of the Internal Revenue Service and other applicable authorities, all of which are subject to change (possibly with retroactive effect). This discussion does not address all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be important to a particular non-U.S. holder in light of that non-U.S. holder\u0092s individual circumstances, nor does it address any aspects of the unearned income Medicare contribution tax pursuant to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, any U.S. federal estate and gift taxes, any U.S. alternative minimum taxes or any state, local or non-U.S. taxes. This discussion may not apply, in whole or in part, to particular non-U.S. holders in light of their individual circumstances or to holders subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, financial institutions, brokers or dealers in securities, \u0093controlled foreign corporations,\u0094 \u0093passive foreign investment companies,\u0094 non-U.S. holders that hold our common stock as part of a straddle, hedge, conversion transaction or other integrated investment and certain U.S. expatriates). \n \n If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner therein will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. Partners of a partnership holding our common \n \n 160 \n \n stock should consult their tax advisor as to the particular U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to them. \n \n THIS SUMMARY IS FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND IS NOT INTENDED TO CONSTITUTE A COMPLETE DESCRIPTION OF ALL TAX CONSEQUENCES FOR NON-U.S. HOLDERS RELATING TO THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMON STOCK. PROSPECTIVE HOLDERS OF OUR COMMON STOCK SHOULD CONSULT WITH THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM (INCLUDING THE APPLICATION AND EFFECT OF ANY STATE, LOCAL, NON-U.S. INCOME AND OTHER TAX LAWS) OF THE OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMON STOCK. \n \n Dividends \n \n In general, the gross amount of any distribution we make to a non-U.S. holder with respect to its shares of common stock will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30% to the extent the distribution constitutes a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes, unless the non-U.S. holder is eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable tax treaty and the non-U.S. holder provides proper certification of its eligibility for such reduced rate (generally an applicable Internal Revenue Service Form W-8). A distribution will constitute a dividend for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To the extent any distribution does not constitute a dividend, it will be treated first as reducing the adjusted basis in the non-U.S. holder\u0092s shares of common stock and then, to the extent it exceeds the adjusted basis in the non-U.S. holder\u0092s shares of common stock, as gain from the sale or exchange of such stock. Any such gain will be subject to the treatment described below under \u0093\u0097Gain on Sale or Other Disposition of Common Stock.\u0094 \n \n Dividends we pay to a non-U.S. holder that are effectively connected with its conduct of a trade or business within the United States (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, are attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of such non-U.S. holder) will not be subject to U.S. withholding tax, as described above, if the non-U.S. holder complies with applicable certification and disclosure requirements. Instead, such dividends generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis, at regular U.S. federal income tax rates. Dividends received by a non-U.S. corporation that are effectively connected with its conduct of trade or business within the United States may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable tax treaty). \n \n Gain on Sale or Other Disposition of Common Stock \n \n In general, a non-U.S. holder will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of the non-U.S. holder\u0092s shares of common stock unless: \n \n \u0095 the gain is effectively connected with a trade or business carried on by the non-U.S. holder within the United States (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, is attributable to a U.S. permanent establishment of such non-U.S. holder); \n \n 161 \n \n \u0095 the non-U.S. holder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of disposition and certain other conditions are met; or \n \n \u0095 we are or have been a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding such disposition or such non-U.S. holder\u0092s holding period of our common stock, and the non-U.S. holder has held, at any time during said period, more than 5% of the class of our stock being sold. \n \n Gain that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States (or so treated) generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income tax basis, at regular U.S. federal income tax rates. If the non-U.S. holder is a non-U.S. corporation, the branch profits tax described above also may apply to such effectively connected gain. An individual non-U.S. holder who is subject to U.S. federal income tax because the non-U.S. holder was present in the United States for 183 days or more during the year of sale or other disposition of our common stock will be subject to a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from such sale or other disposition, which may be offset by U.S. source capital losses. We believe that we are not and we do not anticipate becoming a U.S. real property holding corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \n \n Withholdable Payments to Foreign Financial Institutions and Other Non-U.S. Entities \n \n The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, or FATCA, will impose a U.S. federal withholding tax of 30% on certain payments to foreign financial institutions, investment funds and certain other non-U.S. persons that fail to comply with certain information reporting and certification requirements pertaining to their direct and indirect U.S. securityholders and/or U.S. accountholders. Such payments would include our dividends and the gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common stock. Under applicable Treasury Regulations, this withholding will apply to payments of dividends on our common stock, and to payments of gross proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our common stock made on or after January 1, 2017. Prospective investors are encouraged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in our common stock. \n \n Backup Withholding, Information Reporting and Other Reporting Requirements \n \n We must report annually to the Internal Revenue Service and to each non-U.S. holder the amount of dividends paid to, and the tax withheld with respect to, each non-U.S. holder. These reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced or eliminated by an applicable tax treaty. Copies of this information reporting may also be made available under the provisions of a specific tax treaty or agreement with the tax authorities in the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. \n \n 162 \n \n A non-U.S. holder will generally be subject to backup withholding for dividends on our common stock paid to such holder unless such holder certifies under penalties of perjury (generally by providing an applicable Internal Revenue Service form W-8) that, among other things, it is a non-U.S. holder (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a U.S. person) or otherwise establishes an exemption. \n \n Information reporting and backup withholding generally are not required with respect to the amount of any proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common stock by a non-U.S. holder outside the United States through an office outside the United States of a non-U.S. broker that does not have certain specified connections to the United States. However, if a non-U.S. holder sells or otherwise disposes of its shares of common stock through a U.S. broker or the U.S. offices of a non-U.S. broker, the broker will generally be required to report the amount of proceeds paid to the non-U.S. holder to the Internal Revenue Service and also backup withhold on that amount unless such non-U.S. holder provides appropriate certification to the broker of its status as a non-U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a U.S. person) or otherwise establishes an exemption. Information reporting will also apply if a non-U.S. holder sells its shares of common stock through a non-U.S. broker deriving more than a specified percentage of its income from U.S. sources or having certain other connections to the United States, unless such broker has documentary evidence in its records that such non-U.S. holder is a non-U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual knowledge or reason to know that such holder is a U.S. person) and certain other conditions are met, or such non-U.S. holder otherwise establishes an exemption. \n \n Backup withholding is not an additional income tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a non-U.S. holder generally can be credited against the non-U.S. holder\u0092s U.S. federal income tax liability, if any, or refunded, provided that the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the information reporting and backup withholding rules to them. \n \n 163 \n \n Underwriting \n \n The company, the selling stockholders and the underwriters named below have entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to the shares being offered. Subject to certain conditions, each underwriter has severally agreed to purchase the number of shares indicated in the following table. Goldman, Sachs & Co. is the representative of the underwriters. \n \n Underwriters Number of Shares Goldman, Sachs & Co. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Allen & Company LLC Total \n \n The underwriters are committed to take and pay for all of the shares being offered, if any are taken, other than the shares covered by the option described below unless and until this option is exercised. \n \n The underwriters have an option to buy up to an additional shares from the company to cover sales by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than the total number in the table above. They may exercise that option for 30 days. If any shares are purchased pursuant to this option, the underwriters will severally purchase shares in approximately the same proportion as in the table above. \n \n The following tables show the per share and total estimated underwriting discounts and commissions to be paid to the underwriters by the company and the selling stockholders. Such amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters\u0092 option to purchase additional shares. \n \n Paid by the Company No Exercise Full Exercise Per Share $ $ Total $ $ \n \n Paid by the Selling Stockholders No Exercise Full Exercise Per Share $ $ Total $ $ \n \n Shares sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the initial public offering price on the cover of this prospectus. Any shares sold by the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount of up to $ per share from the initial public offering price. After the initial offering of the shares, the representative may change the offering price and the other selling terms. The offering of the shares by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters\u0092 right to reject any order in whole or in part. \n \n The company and its officers, directors and holders of substantially all of the company\u0092s capital stock, including the selling stockholders, have agreed with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of their common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of \n \n 164 \n \n common stock during periods of at least 180 days, and for a portion of the shares, 270 and 360 days from the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co. This agreement does not apply to any existing employee benefit plans. See \u0093Shares Available for Future Sale\u0094 for a discussion of certain transfer restrictions. \n \n Prior to the offering, there has been no public market for the shares. The initial public offering price will be negotiated among the company and the representative. Among the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price of the shares, in addition to prevailing market conditions, will be the company\u0092s historical performance, estimates of the business potential and earnings prospects of the company, an assessment of the company\u0092s management and the consideration of the above factors in relation to market valuation of companies in related businesses. \n \n The company intends to apply to list the common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol \u0093ETSY.\u0094 \n \n In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering, and a short position represents the amount of such sales that have not been covered by subsequent purchases. A \u0093covered short position\u0094 is a short position that is not greater than the amount of additional shares for which the underwriters\u0092 option described above may be exercised. The underwriters may cover any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to cover the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the option described above. \u0093Naked\u0094 short sales are any short sales that create a short position greater than the amount of additional shares for which the option described above may be exercised. The underwriters must cover any such naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering. \n \n The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representative has repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions. \n \n Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the company\u0092s stock, and together with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain or \n \n 165 \n \n otherwise affect the market price of the common stock. As a result, the price of the common stock may be higher than the price that otherwise might exist in the open market. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time. These transactions may be effected on , in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. \n \n The underwriters do not expect sales to discretionary accounts to exceed five percent of the total number of shares offered. \n \n The company and the selling stockholders estimate that the total expenses of the offering, including registration, filing and listing fees, printing fees and legal and accounting expenses and the expenses of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, qualification, but excluding estimated underwriting discounts and commissions, will be approximately $ . We have agreed to reimburse the underwriters for up to $ of expenses relating to clearance of this offering with FINRA. \n \n The company and the selling stockholders have agreed to indemnify the several underwriters against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. \n \n The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include sales and trading, commercial and investment banking, advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, market making, brokerage and other financial and non-financial activities and services. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have provided, and may in the future provide, a variety of these services to the issuer and to persons and entities with relationships with the issuer, for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses. For example, affiliates of Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC are lenders under our Credit Agreement. \n \n In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates, officers, directors and employees may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instruments for their own account and for the accounts of their customers, and such investment and trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of the issuer (directly, as collateral securing other obligations or otherwise) and/or persons and entities with relationships with the issuer. The underwriters and their respective affiliates may also communicate independent investment recommendations, market color or trading ideas and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such assets, securities or instruments and may at any time hold, or recommend to clients that they should acquire, long and/or short positions in such assets, securities and instruments. In addition, M. Michele Burns, a member of the company\u0092s board of directors, is also a member of the board of directors of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., an affiliate of Goldman, Sachs & Co., an underwriter in this offering. \n \n 166 \n \n IPO Participation Program \n \n At our request, the underwriters have reserved up to 5% of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus for sale, at the initial public offering price, to individual investors. We call this our IPO Participation Program, or IPP. The purpose of the IPP is to allow our U.S.-based Etsy community and other individual investors to participate in our IPO. \n \n Sales in the IPP will be made at our direction by Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, an underwriter of this offering, or its affiliates.

\n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Note 1\u0097Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \n \n Description of Business \n \n Etsy, Inc. (the \u0093Company\u0094 or \u0093Etsy\u0094) was incorporated in Delaware in February 2006. Etsy operates a marketplace where people around the world connect, both online and offline, to make, sell and buy unique goods. The Company generates revenue primarily from transaction and listing fees, Promoted Listings, Direct Checkout fees, and Shipping Label sales. \n \n Evaluation of Subsequent Events \n \n The Company has evaluated subsequent events that occurred after December 31, 2014 through March 4, 2015, the date on which the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 were issued. \n \n Basis of Consolidation \n \n The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Etsy and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The 2012 and 2013 financial statements have been revised to correct certain errors. See Note 15\u0097Revisions to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n \n Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information \n \n Upon the consummation of the initial public offering contemplated by the Company, all of the outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock will convert into shares of common stock. The December 31, 2014 unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet data has been prepared assuming the conversion of the outstanding convertible preferred stock into 106,896,493 shares of common stock. \n \n Use of Estimates \n \n The preparation of the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\u0093GAAP\u0094) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The accounting estimates that require management\u0092s most difficult and subjective judgments include revenue recognition, income taxes, website development costs and internal-use software, purchase price allocations for business combinations, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and stock based compensation. The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and revises them when necessary. Actual results may differ from the original or revised estimates. \n \n F-10 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Revenue Recognition \n \n The Company operates a platform for third-party sellers. Its business model is based on shared success: the Company makes money when Etsy sellers make money. The Company does not compete with Etsy sellers, hold inventory or sell goods. The Company\u0092s revenue is diversified, generated from a mix of marketplace activities and the services the Company provides Etsy sellers to help them create and grow their businesses. The Company\u0092s revenue consists of Marketplace revenue, Seller Services revenue and Other revenue. The Company\u0092s revenue is recorded net of actual and expected refunds. Marketplace revenue includes the fee an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction and the listing fee an Etsy seller pays for each item she lists. Seller Services revenue includes fees an Etsy seller pays for services such as prominent placement in search results via Promoted Listings, payment processing via Direct Checkout and purchases of shipping labels through the Company\u0092s platform via Shipping Labels. The Company deducts its cost of shipping labels and estimated refunds from gross shipping fees to determine net shipping fees. Other revenue includes the fees the Company receives from a third-party payment processor. \n \n The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the Etsy seller; (3) the collection of fees is reasonably assured; and (4) the amount of fees to be paid by the Etsy seller is fixed or determinable. The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to recognize revenue on a gross or net basis based upon its evaluation of whether it is the primary obligor in a transaction, has inventory risk and has latitude in establishing pricing and selecting suppliers. Based on its evaluation of these factors, revenue is recorded net of merchandise values associated with the transaction. \n \n Marketplace revenue. Marketplace revenue consists of the 3.5% fee that an Etsy seller pays for each completed transaction on the Company\u0092s platform, exclusive of shipping fees charged. Marketplace revenue also consists of a listing fee of $0.20 per item that she lists in its marketplace. Revenue from completed Wholesale transactions is also included in Marketplace revenue, whereas revenue from Wholesale enrollment is included in Seller Services revenue. Transaction fees are recognized when the corresponding transaction is made. Listing fees are recognized ratably over a four-month listing period, unless the item is sold or the seller relists it, at which time any remaining listing fee is recognized. \n \n Seller Services revenue. Seller Services revenue consists of fees an Etsy seller pays the Company for the Seller Services she uses, including Promoted Listings, Direct Checkout, Shipping Labels and Wholesale enrollment. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Promoted Listings consists of cost-per-click based fees an Etsy seller pays the Company for prominent placement of her listings in search results generated by Etsy buyers in its marketplace. Revenue is recognized when the Promoted Listing is clicked. \n \n F-11 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Direct Checkout consists of fees an Etsy seller pays the Company to process credit, debit and Etsy Gift Card payments. Direct Checkout fees vary between 3-4% of the item\u0092s total sale price plus a flat fee per order, depending on the country in which her bank account is located. Direct Checkout fees are based on the item\u0092s total sale price, including shipping. Revenue from Direct Checkout is recognized when the corresponding transaction is made. Revenue from breakage on Etsy Gift Cards is recognized when the amount is probable and estimable. Given the lack of historical experience related to gift card activity, there has been no breakage revenue recorded to date. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Shipping Labels consists of fees an Etsy seller pays the Company when she purchases shipping labels directly through its platform, net of the cost it incurs in purchasing those shipping labels. The Company provides its sellers shipping labels from the United States Postal Service and Canada Post at a discounted price due to the volume of purchases through its platform. The Company recognizes Shipping Label revenue when an Etsy seller purchases a shipping label. The Company recognizes Shipping Label revenue on a net basis as it is not the primary obligor in the delivery of these services. \n \n \u0095 Revenue from Wholesale consists of fees an Etsy seller pays the Company when she is approved to enroll in its Wholesale program. The one-time Wholesale enrollment fee is recognized ratably over the estimated customer life. Revenue from completed Wholesale transactions is included in Marketplace revenue. \n \n Other revenue. Other revenue includes the fees the Company receives from a third-party payment processor. Other revenue is recognized as the transactions are processed by the third-party payment processor. \n \n The following table summarizes revenue by type of service (in thousands): \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Marketplace $ 55,330 $ 78,544 $ 108,732 Seller Services 15,863 42,817 82,502 Other 3,409 3,661 4,357 Revenue $ 74,602 $ 125,022 $ 195,591 \n \n F-12 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Cost of Revenue \n \n Cost of revenue consists primarily of expenses associated with the operation and maintenance of the Company\u0092s platform and data centers, including depreciation and amortization, employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost of revenue also includes the cost of interchange and other fees for credit card processing services, credit card verification service fees and credit card chargebacks to support Direct Checkout revenue, as well as employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our member support staff, and costs of refunds made to Etsy buyers that the Company is not able to collect from Etsy sellers. \n \n Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts \n \n The Company\u0092s trade accounts receivable are recorded at amounts billed to Etsy sellers and are presented on the consolidated balance sheet net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is determined by a number of factors, including age of the receivable, current economic conditions, historical losses and management\u0092s assessment of the financial condition of Etsy sellers. Receivables are written off once they are deemed uncollectible, which may arise when Etsy sellers file for bankruptcy or are otherwise deemed unable to repay the amounts owed to the Company. Estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable are recorded to general and administrative expense. \n \n The following table summarizes the allowance activity during the periods indicated (in thousands): \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Balance as of the beginning of period $ 998 $ 1,357 $ 1,279 Bad debt expense 1,295 1,002 1,881 Write-offs, net of recoveries and other adjustments (936 ) (1,080 ) (1,319 ) Balance as of the end of period $ 1,357 $ 1,279 $ 1,841 \n \n Funds Receivable and Seller Accounts and Funds Payable and Amounts due to Sellers \n \n The Company records funds receivable and seller accounts and funds payable and amounts due to sellers as current assets and liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet. Funds receivable and seller accounts represent amounts received or expected to be received from Etsy buyers via third-party credit card processors, which flow through an Etsy bank account for payment to Etsy sellers. This cash and related receivable represent the total amount due to sellers, and as such a liability for the same amount is recorded to funds payable and amounts due to Etsy sellers. \n \n F-13 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Property and Equipment \n \n Property and equipment, consisting principally of computer equipment and purchased software, are recorded at cost. The Company capitalizes construction in progress for build-to-suit lease agreements where we are the owner, for accounting purposes only, during the construction period. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method in amounts sufficient to relate the cost of depreciable and amortizable assets to operations over their estimated useful lives. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. \n \n Internal-use Software and Website Development Costs \n \n Costs incurred to develop software for internal use and the Company\u0092s website are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, generally three years. The Company also capitalizes costs related to upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality or will extend the useful life of existing functionality. Costs related to the design or maintenance of internal-use software and website development are expensed as incurred. The Company periodically reviews internal-use software and website development costs to determine whether the projects will be completed, placed in service, removed from service, or replaced by other internally developed or third-party software. If the asset is not expected to provide any future benefit, the asset is retired and any unamortized cost is expensed. \n \n Depreciable/Amortizable Tangible Long-Lived Assets \n \n When events or changes in circumstances require, the Company assesses the likelihood of recovering the cost of tangible long-lived assets based on its expectations of future profitability, undiscounted cash flows and management\u0092s plans with respect to operations to determine if the asset is impaired and subject to write-off. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the fair value. \n \n Leases \n \n The Company leases office space and certain computer equipment in multiple locations under non-cancelable lease agreements. The leases are reviewed for classification as operating or capital leases. For operating leases, rent is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease period. For capital leases, the Company records the leased asset with a corresponding liability. Payments are recorded as reductions to the liability with an appropriate interest charge recorded based on the then-outstanding remaining liability. \n \n The Company considers the nature of the renovations and the Company\u0092s involvement during the construction period of newly leased office space to determine if it is considered to be the owner of the \n \n F-14 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n construction project during the construction period. If the Company determines that it is the owner of the construction project, it is required to capitalize the fair value of the building as well as the construction costs incurred on its consolidated balance sheet along with a corresponding financing liability (\u0093build-to-suit accounting\u0094). Upon occupancy for build-to-suit leases, the Company assesses whether the circumstances qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If the lease meets the sale-leaseback criteria, the Company will remove the asset and related financial obligation from the balance sheet and treat the building lease as an operating lease. If upon completion of construction, the project does not meet the sale-leaseback criteria, the leased property will be treated as a capital lease for financial reporting purposes. \n \n Business Combinations \n \n The Company has completed a number of acquisitions of other businesses in the past and may acquire additional businesses or technologies in the future. The results of businesses acquired in a business combination are included in the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price, which is the sum of the consideration provided and may consist of cash, equity or a combination of the two, in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to use significant judgment and estimates, including the selection of valuation methodologies, estimates of future revenue and cash flows, discount rates and selection of comparable companies. \n \n When the Company issues stock-based or cash awards to an acquired company\u0092s stockholders, the Company evaluates whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for post-acquisition services. The evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the awards is contingent on the continued employment of the acquired company\u0092s stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as expense over the requisite service period. \n \n The Company carries intangible assets at cost, and it amortizes them on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, typically three years. When circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable, the Company reviews its identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment. \n \n To date, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Company\u0092s business combinations have primarily consisted of goodwill and finite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of developed technologies, customer relationships and trademarks. The estimated fair values and useful lives of identifiable intangible \n \n F-15 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n assets are based on many factors, including estimates and assumptions of future operating performance and cash flows of the acquired business, the nature of the business acquired, and the specific characteristics of the identified intangible assets. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair values and useful lives of identified intangible assets could change due to numerous factors, including market conditions, technological developments, economic conditions and competition. In connection with determination of fair values, the Company may engage independent appraisal firms to assist with the valuation of intangible and certain tangible assets acquired and certain assumed obligations. \n \n Acquisition-related transaction costs incurred by the Company are not included as a component of consideration transferred, but are accounted for as an expense in the period in which the costs are incurred. \n \n Goodwill \n \n Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate fair value of the consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of the assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Management has determined that the Company has a single reporting unit and performs its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired. \n \n Events or changes in circumstances which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes in the manner of the Company\u0092s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the Company\u0092s overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future results of operations, a significant adverse change in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition or a loss of key personnel. \n \n The Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, an entity determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then additional impairment testing is not required. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform the first of a two-step impairment test. \n \n The first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its respective book value, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value exceeds book value, goodwill is considered not to be impaired and no additional steps are necessary. If, however, the fair value of the reporting unit is less than book value, then a second step is required that compares the carrying amount of the goodwill with its implied fair value. The estimate of implied fair value of goodwill may require valuations of certain \n \n F-16 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n internally-generated and unrecognized intangible and tangible net assets. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. \n \n The Company completed a Step 1 analysis during the fourth quarter of 2014. No impairment of goodwill was recorded at December 31, 2013 or 2014. \n \n Intangible Assets \n \n Intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful life of the acquired technology, customer relationships and trademarks, generally three years. \n \n Stock-Based Compensation \n \n For employee stock-based awards, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the expense is recognized over the service period for awards expected to vest. For non-employee stock-based awards, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant in the same manner as employee awards over the contractual term; however, the unvested portion of the awards is revalued at the end of each reporting period until such time as the non-employee award is fully vested. \n \n We account for stock-based compensation arrangements in restricted shares, subject to a put option that allows the holder of the shares to put the shares back to the Company for cash, as liability-classified stock awards. These awards are re-measured at each reporting period, with changes in fair value being charged to the statement of operations. Compensation expense is recognized using a graded vesting methodology for each separately vesting tranche as though the award were, in substance, multiple awards. Unless the put option is exercised, the restricted shares will be reclassified from a liability to an equity classified award upon the termination of the put option. \n \n For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the Company recognized expenses of approximately $3.9 million, $3.7 million and $5.9 million for employee stock options, respectively, and $0.2 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million for non-employee stock options, respectively. \n \n Additionally, the Company recorded $4.1 million in acquisition-related stock-based compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, of which $3.4 million relates to liability-classified awards. \n \n Cash and Cash Equivalents \n \n The Company considers all investments with an original maturity of three months or less at time of purchase to be cash equivalents. \n \n F-17 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Concentration of Credit Risk \n \n Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents. The Company reduces credit risk by placing its cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions with high credit ratings. At times, such amounts may exceed Federally insured limits. \n \n Fair Value of Financial Instruments \n \n Management believes that the fair value of financial instruments, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximates carrying value due to the immediate or short-term maturity associated with its cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable. \n \n Income Taxes \n \n Income tax benefit (provision) is based on (loss) income before income taxes and is accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income in the period that includes the enactment date. Management assesses the need for a valuation allowance on an annual basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. \n \n The Company accounts for uncertainty in income taxes using a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate audit settlement. The Company has no unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2012 and 2013 and has an unrecognized tax benefit of $0.4 million at December 31, 2014. \n \n The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, associated with income tax matters as part of the income tax provision and includes accrued interest and penalties with the related income tax liability in the consolidated balance sheet. \n \n F-18 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Marketing \n \n Marketing expenses consist primarily of targeted online marketing costs, such as search engine marketing, and offline marketing expenses, such as television advertising. Marketing expenses also include employee-related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for our employees involved in marketing, public relations and communications activities. Marketing expenses are expensed as incurred. \n \n Net (Loss) Income Per Share \n \n The Company follows the two-class method when computing net (loss) income per share as the Company has issued shares that meet the definition of participating securities. The two-class method determines net (loss) income per share for each class of common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings. The two-class method requires income available to common stockholders for the period to be allocated between common stock and participating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income for the period had been distributed. \n \n The Company\u0092s convertible preferred stock contractually entitles the holders of such shares to participate in dividends, but does not contractually require the holders of such shares to participate in losses of the Company. Accordingly, the two-class method does not apply for periods in which the Company reports a net loss or a net loss attributable to common stockholders resulting from dividends, accretion or modifications to its convertible preferred stock. \n \n Basic net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders is computed by adjusting net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders to reallocate undistributed earnings based on the potential impact of dilutive securities, including outstanding common stock options, convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock and convertible preferred stock. \n \n Diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the diluted net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares, including potential dilutive common shares assuming the dilutive effect of outstanding common stock options, convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock and convertible preferred stock. For periods in which the Company has reported net losses, diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, because dilutive common shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. \n \n F-19 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Segment Data \n \n The Company identifies operating segments as components of an entity for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions regarding resource allocation and performance assessment. The Company defines the term \u0093chief operating decision maker\u0094 to be its chief executive officer. The Company has determined it operates in one operating segment and one reportable segment, as its chief operating decision maker reviews financial information presented on only a consolidated basis for purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance. \n \n Foreign Currency \n \n The Company has determined that the functional currency for each of its foreign operations is the local currency in which the operation is located. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected in stockholders\u0092 equity as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in foreign exchange loss within other (expense) income in the statement of operations. \n \n Excess Tax Benefits from Exercise of Stock Options \n \n The Company uses the \u0093with and without\u0094 approach in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized. As a result, the Company recognizes a tax benefit from stock-based awards in additional paid-in capital only if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to the Company have been utilized. When tax deductions from stock-based awards are less than the cumulative book compensation expense, the tax effect of the resulting difference (\u0093shortfall\u0094) is charged first to additional paid-in capital, to the extent of the Company\u0092s pool of windfall tax benefits, with any remainder recognized in income tax expense. The Company determined that it had a sufficient windfall pool available through December 31, 2014 to absorb any shortfalls. \n \n Recent Accounting Pronouncements \n \n Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (\u0093JOBS Act\u0094), the Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company. The Company has irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. \n \n In March 2013, the FASB issued new accounting guidance clarifying the accounting for the release of cumulative translation adjustment into net income when a company either sells a part or all of its \n \n F-20 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2013. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements. \n \n In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance. Among other things, the updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. \n \n In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standard update under which management will be required to assess an entity\u0092s ability to continue as a going concern and provide related disclosures in certain circumstances. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and for annual and interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on the Company\u0092s financial statements or disclosures. \n \n Note 2\u0097Business Combinations \n \n In April 2012, the Company acquired the assets of Trunkt LLC for a purchase price of $200,000, plus two additional contingent payments of $100,000 that were tied to continued employment with the Company and were recognized as post-acquisition compensation expense and paid out by the Company in 2013. Acquired assets consisted of customer information, domain access rights, certain web services and a trademark. The purchase price was allocated to the acquired technology intangible assets in the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements. This acquisition did not have any measureable impact on consolidated revenue or (loss) income from operations. \n \n In January 2013, the Company acquired the assets of The Lascaux Company, Inc., owners of the \u0093Mixel\u0094 iOS mobile application, for a purchase price of $750,000, which consisted of $675,000 paid on the closing date and $75,000 due on the first anniversary of the closing date, subject to indemnification provisions. In connection with the acquisition, the Company granted options to purchase 362,320 shares of common stock to certain key employees of the acquired company. Acquired assets consisted of the Mixel iOS mobile application and related source code and domain name registration. The purchase price was allocated between acquired technology intangible assets and goodwill in the Company\u0092s consolidated financial statements. This acquisition did not have any measureable impact on consolidated revenue or (loss) income from operations. \n \n F-21 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n On April 29, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Jarvis Labs, Inc., owners of the \u0093Grand St.\u0094 online technology marketplace. Total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $3.2 million, consisting of $1.0 million in cash and 425,104 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock with a fair value of $2.2 million on the acquisition date. Additionally, the Company issued 657,160 shares of common stock, with a fair value of $3.4 million on the acquisition date, which are tied to continued employment with the Company and are being accounted for as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense over the three-year vesting period. Because the Company is not publicly traded, the Company utilizes equity valuations based on comparable publicly-traded companies, discounted cash flows, an analysis of the Company\u0092s enterprise value and any other factors deemed relevant in estimating the fair value of its common stock for purposes of calculating the fair value of the purchase price. \n \n The following table summarizes the components of the Grand St. purchase price and the allocation of the purchase price at fair value (in thousands): \n \n Cash paid $ 1,040 Common shares 2,202 Total purchase consideration $ 3,242 Working capital $ 85 Developed technology 2,000 Customer relationships 600 Trademarks 200 Goodwill 991 Deferred tax liability (634) Net assets acquired $ 3,242 \n \n Included in working capital is approximately $0.1 million of cash acquired. \n \n The amounts allocated to developed technology, customer relationships and trademark (the acquired intangible assets) total $2.8 million. The fair value assigned to developed technology was determined primarily using the cost approach, which estimates the cost to reproduce the asset, adjusted for loss due to functional and economic obsolescence. The fair value of the Company\u0092s customer relationships was determined primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. The fair value assigned to trademark was determined using the relief from royalty method, where the owner of the asset realizes a benefit from owning the intangible asset rather than paying a rental or royalty rate for use of the asset. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years, which approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized. None of the goodwill recorded in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. \n \n F-22 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n On June 18, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Incubart SAS, a societe par actions simplifiee organized under the laws of France, which operates the online marketplace A Little Market (\u0093ALM\u0094). Total consideration for the acquisition was $30.8 million, consisting of $5.3 million in cash, of which $4.2 million was paid on the closing date and $0.3 million is due to be paid on March 31, 2015 and $0.8 million is due to be paid on February 16, 2016, and 4,879,693 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock with a fair value of $25.5 million on the acquisition date. Because the Company is not publicly traded, the Company utilizes equity valuations based on comparable publicly-traded companies, discounted cash flows, an analysis of the Company\u0092s enterprise value and any other factors deemed relevant in estimating the fair value of its common stock for purposes of calculating the fair value of the purchase price. The terms of the purchase agreement provide for the sale of put options to certain of the former shareholders of ALM. The put options enable the holders of the options to sell up to all of their shares back to the Company, subject to certain vesting and restrictions, at fair value, but not to exceed $4.13 per share and not less than $2.00 per share. The put right terminates with respect to a share on the earlier of one year from when such share is vested or the liquidation date, as defined in the agreement containing the put option. The holders of the options paid an aggregate of $0.1 million cash to the Company at the date of acquisition and the Company recorded a $0.1 million liability for the fair value of the put options at that time. Additionally, the Company issued 1,198,995 shares of common stock, with a fair value of $6.3 million on the acquisition date, which are tied to continued employment with the Company and are being accounted for as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense over the three-year vesting period. Since the put options relate in part to these shares, these restricted shares will be recorded as liability-classified stock awards as earned. \n \n The following table summarizes the components of the purchase price at fair value and the allocation of the purchase price at fair value (in thousands): \n \n Cash paid $ 5,290 Common shares 25,521 Total purchase consideration $ 30,811 Working capital $ 625 Property and equipment and other assets 95 Developed technology 1,636 Customer relationships 1,693 Trademarks 775 Goodwill 27,309 Deferred tax liability (757) Other long-term liabilities (565) Net assets acquired $ 30,811 \n \n Included in working capital is approximately $0.5 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired. \n \n F-23 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n The amount allocated to developed technology, customer relationships and trademark (the acquired intangible assets) total $4.1 million. The fair value assigned to developed technology was determined primarily by using the cost approach, which estimates the cost to reproduce the asset, adjusted for loss due to functional and economic obsolescence. The fair value of the Company\u0092s customer relationships was determined primarily by using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. The fair value assigned to trademark was determined using the relief from royalty method, where the owner of the asset realizes a benefit from owning the intangible asset rather than paying a rental or royalty rate for use of the asset. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years, which approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized. Goodwill of $27.3 million, none of which is deductible for tax purposes, was recorded in connection with the ALM acquisition, which is primarily attributed to synergies arising from the acquisition and the value of the acquired workforce. \n \n The Company incurred approximately $2.1 million in acquisition-related costs, included in general and administrative expenses. These acquisitions increased revenue by $1.8 million and contributed $5.7 million to the Company\u0092s consolidated net loss in the year ended December 31, 2014. The impact to net loss was primarily due to amortization of intangibles and stock-based compensation associated with the acquisitions. \n \n The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined operating results of the Company, Grand St. and ALM as if each acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2013. The unaudited pro forma financial information includes the accounting effects of the business combinations, including adjustments to the amortization of intangible assets and professional fees associated with the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma information does not necessarily reflect the actual results that would have been achieved, nor is it necessarily indicative of our future consolidated results. \n \n The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented in the table below for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 (in thousands except per share amounts): \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2013 2014 Revenue $ 127,838 $ 197,395 Net loss (7,533) (15,403) Basic net loss per share (0.11) (0.19) Diluted net loss per share (0.11) (0.19) \n \n F-24 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Note 3\u0097Marketable Securities \n \n Short-term investments consist of marketable securities that are available-for-sale.

When evaluating investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such as length of time and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and the Company\u0092s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time, which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value. The Company evaluates fair values for each individual security in the investment portfolio. \n \n Note 4\u0097Property and Equipment \n \n Property and equipment consisted of the following as of the dates indicated (in thousands): \n \n As of \n \n December 31, Estimated useful lives 2013 2014 Computer equipment 3 years $ 13,837 $ 16,876 Furniture and equipment 4 years 1,630 1,987 Software 1 - 3 years 2,380 1,146 Leasehold improvements Shorter of life of asset or lease term 2,706 3,134 Construction in progress(1) Not applicable \u0097 51,796 Website development 3 years 23,897 31,156 44,450 106,095 Less: Accumulated depreciation and amortization 21,343 30,557 $ 23,107 $ 75,538 \n \n (1) The Company capitalizes construction in progress and records a corresponding long-term liability for build-to-suit lease arrangements where it is considered the owner, for accounting purposes, during the construction period. \n \n Depreciation and amortization expense on property and equipment was $7.7 million, $12.1 million and $15.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively, which includes amortization expense for equipment acquired under capital leases of $1.5 million, $1.2 million and \n \n F-25 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively.

The loss on write-off for website development and internal-use software assets that were retired during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was $0.1 million, $0.7 million and $0.1 million, respectively. \n \n Note 5\u0097Goodwill and Intangible Assets \n \n The following table summarizes the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the periods indicated (in thousands): \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2013 2014 Balance as of the beginning of the period $ 5,166 $ 5,346 Acquisitions 180 28,300 Other adjustments(1) \u0097 (2,815) Balance as of the end of the period $ 5,346 $ 30,831 \n \n (1) Primarily includes the effect of foreign currency translation. \n \n The Company did not recognize any goodwill impairments during the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014. \n \n F-26 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n At December 31, 2013 and 2014, the gross book value and accumulated amortization of intangible assets were as follows (in thousands): \n \n As of December 31, 2013 As of December 31, 2014 Gross book \n \n value Accumulated \n \n amortization Net book \n \n value Gross book \n \n value Accumulated \n \n amortization Net book \n \n value Trademarks $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 892 $ (169) $ 723 Technology 1,045 (641) 404 4,505 (1,547) 2,958 Customer relationships 200 (111) 89 2,313 (584) 1,729 Intangible assets, net $ 1,245 $ (752 ) $ 493 $ 7,710 $ (2,300) $ 5,410 \n \n Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $ 1.5 million, respectively. \n \n Based on amounts recorded at December 31, 2014, the Company will recognize intangible asset amortization expense in each of the years ending December 31 as follows (in thousands): \n \n 2015 $ 2,368 2016 2,171 2017 871 2018 \u0097 Thereafter \u0097 Total amortization expense $ 5,410 \n \n Note 6\u0097Warrants \n \n The Company has outstanding warrants to purchase 11,373 shares of its Series C Preferred stock with an exercise price of $2.67 per share, 24,510 shares of its Series D Preferred stock with an exercise price of $6.63 per share, and 4,723 shares of its Series E Preferred stock with an exercise price of $15.88 per share (see Note 8). All of these warrants were originally issued in connection with previous lines of credit and were fair valued on the date of issuance, and the fair value amount was recognized as debt issuance costs and amortized to interest expense over the original life of the line of credit. As these warrants are exercisable into shares of Preferred stock, which include certain redemption rights that are outside of the control the Company, in accordance with ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the warrants are accounted for as liabilities and are revalued at each balance sheet date. The warrants were fully vested at issuance. \n \n F-27 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n The Company determined the fair value of the convertible preferred stock warrants utilizing the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted-average assumptions: \n \n Series C December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Risk-free interest rate 0.7% 1.3% 1.1% Expected term (in years) 5.0 4.0 3.0 Estimated dividend yield 0% 0% 0% Weighted-average estimated volatility 40.0% 41.0% 43.1% Fair value (in thousands) $ 319 $ 442 $ 579 Series D December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Risk-free interest rate 0.3% 0.3% 0.5% Expected term (in years) 2.5 1.5 0.5 Estimated dividend yield 0% 0% 0% Weighted-average estimated volatility 39.0% 36.0% 38.9% Fair value (in thousands) $ 597 $ 859 $ 1,156 Series E December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Risk-free interest rate 0.7% 1.3% 1.1% Expected term (in years) 5.0 4.0 3.0 Estimated dividend yield 0% 0% 0% Weighted-average estimated volatility 39.0% 41.0% 43.1% Fair value (in thousands) $ 93 $ 127 $ 185 \n \n During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the Company recorded an unrealized loss of $0.7 million, $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively, from the remeasurement of the warrants to fair value. \n \n In June 2012, the Company issued 5,056 shares of Series C preferred stock to convert 5,481 warrants at an exercise price of $2.67 per share. The fair market value of a share of common stock at the time of exercise was $3.45. The warrant holder exercised the right to convert this warrant in a cashless transaction and 425 shares were forfeited to the Company as payment of the exercise price. The Company revalued the warrant at the time of exercise and reclassified approximately $0.2 million in warrant liability to Series C preferred stock. \n \n F-28 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Note 7\u0097Debt \n \n Credit Agreement \n \n In May 2014, the Company entered into a $35.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to a Revolving Credit and Guaranty Agreement with several lenders (the \u0093Credit Agreement\u0094). The Credit Agreement will mature in May 2019. The Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sublimit of $10.0 million and a swingline loan sublimit of $15.0 million. \n \n Borrowings under the Credit Agreement (other than swingline loans) bear interest, at the Company\u0092s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (c) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, in each case plus a margin ranging from 0.00% to 0.25% or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.25%. Swingline loans under the Credit Agreement bear interest at the same base rate (plus the margin applicable to borrowings bearing interest at the base rate). These margins are determined based on the total leverage ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarter period. The Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including an unused commitment fee and fees associated with letters of credit. The Credit Agreement also permits the Company, in certain circumstances, to request an increase in the facility by an amount of up to $50.0 million (and in minimum amounts of $10.0 million) at the same maturity, pricing and other terms. \n \n The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries and customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Company and its restricted subsidiaries. The negative covenants include restrictions on, among other things, indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers, dispositions, transactions with affiliates and dividends and other distributions. These restrictions do not prohibit a subsidiary of the Company from making pro rata payments to the Company or any other person that owns an equity interest in such subsidiary. The Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant that requires the Company and its subsidiaries to maintain a total leverage ratio (defined as net debt to adjusted EBITDA) not to exceed 3.50 to 1.00. \n \n The Credit Agreement includes customary events of default, including a change in control and a cross-default on the Company\u0092s material indebtedness. The Company\u0092s obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the Company and its subsidiaries\u0092 assets, and its obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of the Company\u0092s subsidiaries. \n \n At December 31, 2014, the Company did not have any borrowings under the Credit Agreement. In January 2015, the Company implemented a revised corporate structure to more closely align its structure with its global operations and future expansion plans outside the United States. The amendment to the Credit \n \n F-29 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Agreement described below includes a waiver with respect to the Company\u0092s compliance with certain restrictions in the Credit Agreement, to the extent that actions taken to implement its revised corporate structure could be construed as breaches or defaults under the Credit Agreement. \n \n Subsequent Event \n \n In March 2015, the Company amended the Credit Agreement (the \u0093Amended Credit Agreement\u0094) to increase the senior secured revolving credit facility to $50.0 million. The Amended Credit Agreement contains the same pricing covenants and other material terms as the Credit Agreement. \n \n Facility Financing Obligation \n \n As a result of the nature of and the Company\u0092s involvement in the renovations during the construction period of the newly leased office space in Brooklyn, NY, it is considered to be the owner, for accounting purposes only, of the construction project and is required to capitalize the fair value of the building as well as the construction costs incurred by the landlord on its consolidated balance sheet (\u0093build-to-suit accounting\u0094). Under the build-to-suit accounting guidance, through December 31, 2014 the Company has recorded a facility financing obligation of $50.3 million, equal to the fair market value of the assets received from the landlord as of the lease signing date in May 2014 and the estimated fair value of the subsequent construction costs incurred by the landlord through December 31, 2014. \n \n Note 8\u0097Stockholders\u0092 Equity \n \n At December 31, 2013 and 2014, the authorized capital stock of the Company consisted of 205,000,000 and 240,000,000 shares of common stock, respectively, and 21,165,473 shares of convertible preferred stock. The convertible preferred stock, with the exclusion of Series 1 preferred stock, is referred to as \u0093senior preferred stock.\u0094 \n \n Common Stock \n \n At December 31, 2012, there were 65,461,422 and 64,163,832 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively. At December 31, 2013, there were 66,165,965 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. At December 31, 2014, there were 88,361,973 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Holders of common stock are not entitled to receive dividends unless declared by the board of directors. The voting, dividend and liquidation rights of \n \n F-30 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n the holders of common stock are subject to and qualified by the rights and preferences of the holders of convertible preferred stock. No dividends have been declared through December 31, 2014. The common stock has a $0.001 par value. \n \n Convertible Preferred Stock \n \n In May 2012, the Company entered into the Series F Stock Purchase Agreement with several investors to sell 11,594,203 shares of Series F preferred stock at $3.45 per share for an aggregate value of $40.0 million. The Company recorded stock issuance costs of approximately $0.2 million as additional paid-in-capital in connection with the Series F preferred stock financing. \n \n At December 31, 2013 and 2014, the Company\u0092s outstanding convertible preferred stock consisted of the following (in thousands, except share data): \n \n Shares \n \n Authorized Shares \n \n Outstanding Carrying \n \n Values Series A and A-1 preferred stock 2,363,786 2,363,786 $ 808 Series B preferred stock 1,128,431 1,128,425 865 Series C preferred stock 1,234,084 1,222,282 3,361 Series D and D-1 preferred stock 4,240,120 4,215,610 27,870 Series E preferred stock 401,450 396,727 6,201 Series 1 preferred stock 203,399 203,399 1,322 Series F preferred stock 11,594,203 11,594,203 39,785 Total convertible preferred stock 21,165,473 21,124,432 $ 80,212 \n \n The rights and preferences of the convertible preferred stock are as follows: \n \n Voting Rights. Each holder of convertible preferred stock is entitled to one vote for each share of common stock into which such holder\u0092s shares of convertible preferred stock are then convertible. Except as provided by law or the Company\u0092s Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of the convertible preferred stock and common stock vote together as a single class. The holders of preferred stock are entitled to voting rights for the election of board of director members as follows: Series A-1, Series B and Series C vote together as a single class to elect one director, Series D and Series D-1 vote as a single class to elect one director and Series E votes to elect one director. Additionally, the holders of common stock elect one director. All remaining directors are elected by the holders of preferred stock and common stock voting together as a single class. \n \n Dividends. The holders of the convertible preferred stock are entitled, when, as and if declared by the board of directors, and prior and in preference to common stock, to receive non-cumulative dividends at a rate of 8% of the original purchase price per share (listed in the table below). Payment of any dividends to the holders of the convertible preferred stock shall be made on a pro rata, pari passu basis in proportion to the \n \n F-31 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n dividend rates for each series of convertible preferred stock. The right to receive dividends on shares of convertible preferred stock shall not be cumulative, and no right to such dividends shall accrue to holders of cumulative preferred stock by reason of the fact that dividends on said shares are not declared or paid in any calendar year. \n \n Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company, the holders of the senior preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution to the holders of the Series 1 preferred stock and common stock, an amount per share equal to the sum of the liquidation preference (presented below) and all declared but unpaid dividends (if any). If amounts available to be distributed are insufficient to pay the liquidation preferences of the senior preferred stock in full, then the entire assets of the Company legally available for distribution shall be distributed to the holders of the senior preferred stock ratably in proportion to the preferential amount each holder would have otherwise been entitled to receive. After payment of the liquidation preferences to the senior preferred stock, if assets remain available for distribution to the Company\u0092s stockholders, the holders of Series 1 preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, prior and in preference to any distribution to the holders of common stock, an amount per share equal to the sum of the liquidation preference applicable to the Series 1 preferred stock and all declared but unpaid dividends (if any). If the remaining amounts available to be distributed are insufficient to pay the liquidation preferences of the Series 1 preferred stock in full, then the entire assets of the Company legally available for distribution shall be distributed ratably in proportion to the preferential amount each holder would have otherwise been entitled to receive. After payment of the liquidation preferences to the convertible preferred stock, all remaining assets shall be distributed to the holders of the common stock of the Company in proportion to the number of shares of common stock held by them. \n \n The liquidation preference provisions of the convertible preferred stock are considered contingent redemption provisions because there are certain elements that are not solely within the control of the Company, such as a change in control of the Company. Accordingly, the Company has presented the convertible preferred stock within the mezzanine portion of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. \n \n F-32 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Conversion. Each outstanding share of convertible preferred stock is convertible, at the holder\u0092s option or automatically upon certain events as described below, into shares of common stock at a conversion rate determined by dividing the original issue price for such share by the then Conversion Price for such share. The original issue price, conversion price and liquidation preference price of each series of preferred stock are as follows: \n \n Price Per Share Original Issue \n \n Price Conversion \n \n Price Liquidation \n \n Preference Series A preferred stock $ 0.2429 $ 0.02429 $ 0.2429 Series A-1 preferred stock 0.3915 0.03915 0.3915 Series B preferred stock 0.80 0.080 0.80 Series C preferred stock 2.67 0.267 2.67 Series D preferred stock 6.63 0.663 6.63 Series D-1 preferred stock 6.63 0.663 6.63 Series E preferred stock 15.88 1.588 15.88 Series 1 preferred stock 6.45 0.645 6.45 Series F preferred stock 3.45 3.45 3.45 \n \n The conversion price is subject to adjustment in the event of certain anti-dilutive issuances of shares of common stock. The conversion price per share in the table above reflects the adjustment for the 10-for-1 stock split of the Company\u0092s common stock effective in May 2011. \n \n Each share of convertible preferred stock will convert into shares of common stock at its then effective conversion rate upon the earlier of (A) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, with gross proceeds to the Company of not less than $30 million, or (B) upon receipt by the Company of a written request for such conversion from the holders of not less than a majority of the convertible preferred stock, voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis. No shares of Series F preferred stock shall be converted into shares of common stock unless either (i) such conversion is in connection with a public offering where the price per share is equal to or greater than $5.18, or (ii) the holders of a majority of the Series F preferred stock, voting as a separate class, otherwise consent to such conversion. \n \n Redemption. The convertible preferred stock is not redeemable at the option of the holder. \n \n Tender Offers \n \n In connection with the May 2012 Series F Preferred Stock financing, the Series F investors participated in a tender offer to purchase up to an aggregate of 12,753,623 shares of common stock and preferred stock (on an as-converted basis) at a price of $3.45 per share (on an as-converted basis) from the Company\u0092s employees and existing stockholders with the maximum aggregate offer price of up to $44.0 million. The terms of the tender offer were further limited to a maximum of 30% of a participant\u0092s fully-vested stock and options and \n \n F-33 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n warrants to purchase stock. The tender offer was made on May 15, 2012 and expired on July 6, 2012. At the close of the transaction, the Company recorded approximately $0.9 million as compensation expense related to the excess of the selling price per share paid to the Company\u0092s employees and former employees over the fair value of the tendered shares, and approximately $0.3 million as a deemed dividend in relation to the excess of the selling price per share paid to existing investors over the fair value of the shares tendered. \n \n On January 13, 2014, certain investors participated in a tender offer to purchase up to an aggregate of 14,000,000 shares of common stock and preferred stock (on an as-converted basis) at a price of $5.30 per share (on an as-converted basis) from the Company\u0092s employees and existing stockholders with the maximum aggregate offer price of up to $74.2 million. The terms of the tender offer were limited to a maximum of one-half of an employee\u0092s fully-vested stock and options and warrants to purchase stock and a minimum of one-half of a former employee\u0092s or non-employee\u0092s fully-vested stock and options and warrants to purchase stock. At the close of the transaction, 6,308,440 shares were tendered for a total price of $33.4 million. \n \n Common Stock Issuances \n \n In April 2014, the Company issued 6,603,774 shares of common stock to certain investors at $5.30 per share for an aggregate value of $35.0 million. \n \n Additionally, the Company issued a total of 7,160,952 shares of common stock in connection with the acquisitions of Grand St. and ALM, of which 5,304,797 shares with an aggregate fair value of $27.7 million on the applicable acquisition dates are included in the Company\u0092s purchase price and 1,856,155 shares with an aggregate fair value of $9.7 million on the applicable acquisition dates are tied to continued employment with the Company and are being accounted for as post-acquisition compensation expense. \n \n Stock Repurchases \n \n In 2012, the board of directors authorized the repurchase of 20,000 shares of outstanding common stock at a cost of $0.1 million, 6 shares of outstanding Series B preferred stock at a cost of $297, and 4 shares of outstanding Series C preferred stock at a cost of $126. These repurchased shares were retired and removed from the number of shares issued in the consolidated balance sheet. \n \n In 2013, the board of directors authorized the repurchase and retirement of 47,000 shares of outstanding common stock at a cost of $0.2 million. The repurchased shares were retired and have been removed from both the issued and outstanding number of shares in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of stockholders\u0092 equity. \n \n F-34 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n Secondary Transactions \n \n In the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company recorded $0.5 million as compensation expense related to the excess of the selling price per share paid to certain of the Company\u0092s former employees over the fair value of the shares sold to an investor by these former employees in secondary transactions. \n \n Note 9\u0097Stock-based Compensation \n \n The Company maintains the 2006 Stock Plan (the \u0093Stock Plan\u0094). Under the Stock Plan, incentive and nonqualified stock options or rights to purchase common stock may be granted to eligible participants. Options are generally granted for a term of 10 years. Options granted under the Stock Plan generally vest 25% after the first year of service and ratably each month over the remaining 36-month period contingent on continued employment with the Company on each vesting date. At December 31, 2013 and 2014, 43,432,935 and 48,505,935 shares were authorized under the Stock Plan, respectively, and 3,063,945 and 3,036,004 shares were available for future grant, respectively. \n \n The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Since the Company is not publicly traded, the Company utilizes equity valuations based on comparable publicly-traded companies, discounted free cash flows, an analysis of the Company\u0092s enterprise value and any other factors deemed relevant in estimating the fair value of its common stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on implied volatilities from market comparisons of certain publicly traded companies and other factors. The expected term of stock options granted has been determined using the simplified method, which uses the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual term. The requisite service period is generally four years from the date of grant. \n \n The fair value of options granted in each year using the Black-Scholes pricing model has been based on the following assumptions: \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Volatility 42.7% - 43.9% 45.7% - 50.3% 43.0% - 49.0% Risk-free interest rate 0.7% - 1.1% 0.9% - 1.9% 1.7% - 2.1% Expected term (in years) 5.12 - 6.08 5.48 - 6.08 5.46 - 6.08 Dividend rate \u0097% \u0097% \u0097% \n \n F-35 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n The following table summarizes the activity for the Company\u0092s options: \n \n Shares Weighted-Average \n \n Exercise Price Weighted-Average \n \n Remaining Contract \n \n Term (in years) Aggregate \n \n Intrinsic Value Outstanding at January 1, 2012 25,037,740 $ 0.73 Granted 7,717,321 2.33 Exercised (5,889,452) 0.79 Forfeited/Cancelled (2,993,224) 1.15 Outstanding at December 31, 2012 23,872,385 1.18 Granted 6,152,210 2.76 Exercised (2,049,133) 0.65 Forfeited/Cancelled (1,594,527) 1.90 Outstanding at December 31, 2013 26,380,935 1.55 7.42 Granted 6,413,435 5.14 Exercised (8,431,282) 0.94 Forfeited/Cancelled (1,312,494) 3.29 Outstanding at December 31, 2014 23,050,594 2.67 7.57 $ 134,386,069 Total exercisable at December 31, 2014 11,212,671 1.44 6.32 79,212,034 Total vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2014 21,663,138 2.57 7.48 128,508,325 \n \n The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was $0.97, $1.30 and $2.43, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was $9.0 million, $4.0 million and $24.8 million, respectively, and the total fair value of awards that vested in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was $2.5 million, $3.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2014, the Company had approximately $6.9 million and $4.3 million of federal and preapportionment New York City NOL carryforwards, respectively, as well as immaterial amounts of NOLs in other states. The federal NOLs will begin to expire in 2031 if unused. The New York City NOLs will expire in 2033 if unused. All of the federal NOLs and most of the other NOL carryforwards are attributable to excess tax deductions from stock option exercises. The benefit of these NOLs will be credited to additional paid in capital when the NOLs are utilized. \n \n As of December 31, 2013 and 2014, the Company had approximately $0.2 million of federal alternative minimum tax credits, which may be carried forward indefinitely. \n \n The utilization of the Company\u0092s NOL carryforwards is subject to an annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code due to a change of ownership. However, the Company does not believe such annual limitation will impact its realization of the NOL carryforwards. \n \n The Company assesses the likelihood of its ability to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction by evaluating all relevant positive and negative evidence. To the extent the Company determines that some or all of its deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized, it establishes a valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company determined that the existence of a three-year cumulative loss incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions, inclusive of 2014, constituted sufficiently strong negative evidence to warrant the establishment of a valuation allowance. As a result, a valuation allowance of $1.9 million as of December 31, 2014 has been recorded against certain of the Company\u0092s deferred tax assets. The amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable is $7.2 million. \n \n The following table summarizes the valuation allowance activity for the periods indicated (in thousands): \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 2013 2014 Balance as of the beginning of period $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 Additions charged to expense \u0097 \u0097 3,915 Deletions credited to expense \u0097 \u0097 (1,850 ) Currency translation \u0097 \u0097 (173 ) Balance as of the end of period $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 1,892 \n \n F-39 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n The Company has not recorded deferred income taxes with respect to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are expected to remain reinvested indefinitely. Upon distribution as dividends or otherwise, such amounts would be subject to taxation in the U.S. However, U.S. tax liabilities would be offset, in whole or part, by allowable tax credits with respect to income taxes previously paid to foreign jurisdictions. The amount of undistributed earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries at December 31, 2014, as well as the related deferred income tax, if any, is not material. \n \n As of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, the Company had no unrecognized income tax benefits.

The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), and lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). If the inputs used to measure the investments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the investment. Investments recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet are categorized based on the inputs to valuation techniques as follows: \n \n Level 1\u0097These are investments where values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market that the Company has the ability to access. \n \n Level 2\u0097These are investments where values are based on quoted market prices in markets that are not active or model derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. \n \n Level 3\u0097These are liabilities where values are derived from techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable. \n \n The following are the major categories of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2013 and 2014 using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1), significant other observable inputs (Level 2) and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in

All significant long-lived assets are located in the United States. \n \n Note 14\u0097Commitments and Contingencies \n \n Lease Commitments \n \n Capital Leases \n \n The Company entered into a credit agreement with ePlus Group, Inc (\u0093ePlus\u0094) on January 3, 2014, which provided the Company with a credit line of up to $8.0 million for computer equipment leases (the \u0093ePlus Line\u0094). The ePlus Line allows the Company to order equipment from any approved vendor. ePlus purchases the equipment on behalf of the Company and leases it back to the Company. The leases have a 36-month term and are payable in equal monthly installments with a buy-out option of $1 or fair market value at the end of the lease term depending on the equipment. As of December 31, 2014, the Company has leased approximately $5.6 million of computer equipment using the ePlus Line. \n \n The Company had a credit agreement with TriplePoint Capital, LLC (\u0093TriplePoint\u0094), which provided the Company with a credit line of up to $20.0 million for computer equipment leases (the \u0093TriplePoint Line\u0094). The TriplePoint Line allowed the Company to order equipment from any vendor. TriplePoint purchased the equipment on behalf of the Company and leased it back to the Company. The leases have a 36-month term, interest rate of 8.25%, and are payable in equal monthly installments. The Company stopped buying equipment under the TriplePoint Line in June 2012 and is paying off the remaining lease obligations in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement. At December 31, 2014, the Company had leased approximately $0.4 million of computer equipment using the TriplePoint Line. \n \n In connection with the execution of the TriplePoint Line, the Company issued TriplePoint a warrant to purchase 4,723 shares of Series E Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $15.88 per share (the \u0093TriplePoint Series E Warrant\u0094). The TriplePoint Series E Warrant was valued at $43,000 on the date of issuance, which \n \n F-45 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n the Company recognized as debt issuance cost and amortized over 36 months from the date of issuance. The warrant was fully vested at issuance. \n \n For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, the accompanying consolidated statement of operations includes charges of approximately $0.4 million, $0.2 million and $0.4 million for interest expense, respectively, related to the equipment leased using the TriplePoint Line and ePlus Lines. \n \n Operating Leases \n \n In 2012, the Company amended its existing lease for office space in Brooklyn, NY to extend its expiration to 2016. The portion of deferred rent liability related to the prior lease of approximately $0.3 million is being amortized and recorded as rent expense over the new lease term. During 2012, the Company also entered into a new lease for office space in San Francisco, CA expiring in 2017. In 2014, the Company entered into a new lease for office space in Dublin, Ireland expiring in 2024. Rent expense for these operating leases is recognized over the term of each respective lease on a straight-line basis. In addition, the Company leases other office facilities under shorter terms and cancellable leases. \n \n Total rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014 was $1.7 million, $2.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively. \n \n Build-to-Suit Lease \n \n In May 2014, the Company entered into a 10-year lease agreement for approximately 199,000 rentable square feet of office space in Brooklyn, NY for the Company\u0092s new headquarters, which lease is expected to commence in 2015. Of the total new office space, approximately 172,000 rentable square feet is being accounted for as a build-to-suit lease and approximately 27,000 rentable square feet located in an adjacent building is being accounted for as an operating lease. In connection with the lease agreement, the Company established a $5.3 million collateral account, reflected in the restricted cash balance on the consolidated balance sheet. \n \n F-46 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n The following table represents the Company\u0092s commitments under its current capital, operating, and build-to-suit lease agreements as of December 31, 2014 (in thousands): \n \n Capital Lease \n \n Obligations Operating \n \n Leases Build-to-Suit \n \n Lease Periods ending 2015 $ 2,288 $ 3,870 $ \u0097 2016 2,250 854 529 2017 1,257 1,845 9,155 2018 \u0097 1,756 9,394 2019 \u0097 1,767 9,464 Thereafter \u0097 10,952 61,772 Total minimum payments required $ 5,795 $ 21,044 $ 90,314 Amounts representing interest 892 Present value of net minimum payments 4,903 Current maturities 1,755 Long-term payment obligations $ 3,148 \n \n Tax Contingencies \n \n The Company had a reserve of $2.5 million and $3.5 million at December 31, 2013 and 2014, respectively, for certain non-income tax obligations, representing management\u0092s best estimate of its liability. In addition, the Company could be subject to examination in various jurisdictions related to income and non-income tax matters. The resolution of these types of matters, giving recognition to the recorded reserve, could have an adverse impact on the Company\u0092s business. \n \n Legal Proceedings \n \n From time to time in the normal course of business, various claims and litigation have been asserted or commenced against the Company. Due to uncertainties inherent in litigation and other claims, the Company can give no assurance that it will prevail in any such matters, which could subject the Company to significant liability for damages. Any claims or litigation, regardless of their success, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u0092s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period the claims or litigation are resolved. As of December 31, 2014, the Company does not believe that there are any material litigation exposures. \n \n Note 15\u0097Revisions to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company determined that its prior years\u0092 annual consolidated financial statements included an understatement in certain non-income tax-related expenses. This understatement \n \n F-47 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n impacts the Company\u0092s consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, balance sheets and statements of cash flows.

Based on quantitative and qualitative factors, the Company determined that the errors were not material to any previously issued annual consolidated financial statements. The Company determined that the correction of the cumulative amounts of the errors would be material to the consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2014 and, as such, has revised its previously issued consolidated financial statements for 2012 and 2013. The adjustments related to years prior to 2012 are reflected as a $0.1 million adjustment to beginning accumulated deficit for fiscal year 2012.

The errors impact the Company\u0092s consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), balance sheets and statements of cash flows in each period. The Company assessed the effect of the errors on prior periods\u0092 financial statements in accordance with SAB No. 99\u0097Materiality and SAB No. 108\u0097Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements and, based on quantitative and qualitative factors, determined that the errors, in combination with the understatement of non-income tax-related expenses described in Note 15, were material to the consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2014, the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and the nine months ended September 30, 2014. As such, the Company has restated its interim \n \n F-49 \n \n Etsy, Inc. \n \n Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements \n \n consolidated financial statements for these periods.

We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Jarvis Labs, Inc., which comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and the related statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in convertible preferred stock and stockholders\u0092 deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013 and the period from June 11, 2012 (inception) to December 31, 2012. \n \n Management\u0092s Responsibility for the Financial Statements \n \n Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \n \n Auditor\u0092s Responsibility \n \n Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. \n \n An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company\u0092s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u0092s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. \n \n F-54 \n \n Opinion \n \n In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Jarvis Labs, Inc. at December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2013 and for the period from June 11, 2012 (inception) to December 31, 2012 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. \n \n /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP \n \n New York, New York \n \n November 3, 2014 \n \n F-55 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Balance Sheets \n \n As of \n \n December 31, \n \n 2012 As of \n

Organization \n \n Organization and Nature of Business \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. (the \u0093Company\u0094) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on June 11, 2012 (inception). The Company owns and operates Grandst.com, a website that provides a marketplace for creative new technology and merchandise. The Company generates revenue through direct retail sales. The Company is based in New York, NY and operates in the United States. \n \n Unaudited Interim Financial Information \n \n The accompanying balance sheet as of March 31, 2014, the related statements of operations, comprehensive loss and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014, and the statement of changes in convertible preferred stock and stockholders\u0092 deficit for the three months ended March 31, 2014 are unaudited. The unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments necessary to state fairly the Company\u0092s financial position as of March 31, 2014 and results of operations and cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014. The financial data and the other information disclosed in these notes to the financial statements related to these three-month periods are unaudited. \n \n Use of Estimates \n \n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. The accounting estimates that require management\u0092s most difficult and subjective judgments include the useful life and recoverability of fixed assets, the fair value of options issued for services and the fair value of warrants. The Company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and revises when necessary. Actual results could differ from those estimates. \n \n Revenue Recognition \n \n The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when the following four criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. \n \n F-60 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n The Company evaluates whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of product sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions. Generally, the Company is the primary obligor in its sales to customers, has latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers and maintains inventory risk, and therefore revenue is recorded at the gross sales price. \n \n Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees. Product sales and shipping revenues, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes to customers. \n \n Cost of Sales \n \n Cost of sales consists of the purchase price of products sold, inbound shipping and duty charges and credit card processing fees. Shipping charges to receive products from the Company\u0092s suppliers are included in the Company\u0092s inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to the Company\u0092s customers. \n \n Cash and Cash Equivalents \n \n The Company considers all short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. \n \n Inventory \n \n The Company\u0092s inventory is comprised of finished goods and are valued at the lower of average cost or market, and are evaluated periodically for product obsolescence, excess balances and other indications of impairment in value. \n \n Property and Equipment \n \n Property and equipment consisting of office furniture, office and computer equipment and leasehold improvements are recorded at cost. Property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term. \n \n Fair Value Measurement \n \n The Company\u0092s financial instruments are measured and recorded at fair value based on inputs and assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining fair value, management considers the principal or most advantageous market in which \n \n F-61 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n the Company would transact, and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of non-performance. \n \n ASC Topic 820 further requires disclosures on the amount and reason for transfers in and out of Level 1 and 2 fair value measurements. The standards also require disclosure of activities, including purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements within the Level 3 fair value measurements. The standards also clarify existing disclosure requirements on levels of disaggregation and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques. This pronouncement requires disclosure regarding the manner in which fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and establishes a three-tiered value hierarchy into which these assets and liabilities are grouped, based upon significant inputs as follows: \n \n Level 1\u0097Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. \n \n Level 2\u0097Observable inputs, other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. \n \n Level 3\u0097Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within Level 3, the determination is based upon the lack of significance of the observable parameters to the overall fair value measurement. However, the fair value determination for Level 3 financial instruments may consider some observable market inputs. \n \n The lowest level of significant input determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. \n \n The following table reflects the activity for the Company\u0092s major classes of liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs: \n \n Total Fair \n \n Value at \n \n March 31, \n \n 2014 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Liabilities: Warrant liabilities $ 70,137 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 70,137 Total Liabilities $ 70,137 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 70,137 \n \n F-62 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n Total Fair \n \n Value at \n \n December 31, \n \n 2013 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Liabilities: Warrant liabilities $ 56,844 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 56,844 Total Liabilities $ 56,844 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 56,844 \n \n The following table reflects the activity for the Company\u0092s major classes of liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs: \n \n Liabilities: Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2012 Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2013 Three Months Ended \n \n March 31, 2014 (Unaudited) Balance at beginning of period $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ 56,844 Level 3 liabilities acquired \u0097 46,098 \u0097 Level 3 liabilities settled \u0097 \u0097 \u0097 Unrealized loss on warrant liability \u0097 10,746 13,293 Included in earnings (unrealized) \u0097 \u0097 \u0097 Balance at end of period $ \u0097 $ 56,844 $ 70,137 \n \n Impairment of Long-lived Assets \n \n The Company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long-lived assets may require revision, or that the remaining balance of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When factors indicate that long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the long-lived asset group in measuring whether they are recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, a loss is recorded to the extent the asset group\u0092s carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value would typically be determined based upon the asset group\u0092s estimated discounted cash flows. No assets were determined to be impaired in the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013. \n \n Sales and Marketing \n \n Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of online and offline advertising costs, marketing materials and market research. Advertising costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. The advertising and promotion costs for 2012 and 2013 and for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014 are $14,758, $217,558, $65,832 and $11,618 respectively. \n \n F-63 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n Product and Technology \n \n Product and technology expenses include facilities costs, technology compensation, stock based compensation and employee benefits, website hosting fees, software licensing costs and certain other allocated costs. \n \n General and Administrative \n \n General and administrative expenses include facilities costs, administrative charges, professional services fees and other general overhead costs. \n \n Stock-based Compensation \n \n The stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is amortized over the requisite service period for the award granted. \n \n Calculating stock-based compensation requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the stock-based awards and stock price volatility. The Company estimates the expected life of stock options granted based on the simplified method, which the Company believes is representative of future behavior. The Company estimates the volatility of the common stock on the date of grant based on the historic volatility of comparable companies in the industry. The Company selected the risk-free interest rate based on yields from United States Treasury zero-coupon issues for a term consistent with the expected life of the awards in effect at the time of grant. The Company estimates the expected forfeiture rate based on historical experience of the stock-based awards that are granted, exercised and canceled. \n \n The Company may, from time to time, grant stock options to non-employees. For non-employee stock options, the Company calculates the fair value of the award on the date of grant in the same manner as employee awards, however the unvested portion of the awards are revalued at the end of each reporting period and the pro-rata compensation expense is adjusted accordingly until such time the non-employee award is fully vested. At the time, the total compensation recognized to date shall equal the fair value of the award as calculated on the measurement date, which is the date at which the award recipient\u0092s performance is complete. \n \n Concentrations of Credit Risk \n \n Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. At times, such amounts may exceed the limits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \n \n F-64 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n The Company\u0092s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, loans receivable, accounts payable, and loans payable. At December 31, 2012 and 2013 and for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014 the fair values of these instruments approximated their financial statement carrying amounts due to their relatively short-term nature. \n \n Income Taxes \n \n The Company utilizes the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the classification of the related assets or liabilities for financial reporting, or according to the expected reversal dates of the specific temporary differences if not related to an asset or liability for financial reporting. Valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. \n \n As of December 31, 2012 and 2013, the Company recorded a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets. Consequently, the Company has not recognized deferred income tax assets or liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. \n \n The Company\u0092s policy is to recognize interest and penalties expense, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. The Company\u0092s uncertain tax positions are related to tax years that remain subject to examination by the relevant tax authorities. As of December 31, 2013, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions. \n \n F-65 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n 2. Property and Equipment \n \n Property and equipment at December 31, 2012, 2013 and for the three months ended March 31, 2014 consists of the following: \n \n Estimated \n \n Useful Lives Year Ended \n \n December 31, Three Months Ended \n \n March 31, 2014 2012 2013 (Unaudited) Computer equipment 3 years $ 15,355 $ 24,801 $ 24,801 Furniture and Equipment 4 years \u0097 9,046 9,046 Leasehold Improvements Shorter of life \n \n of asset or \n \n lease term \u0097 19,083 19,083 Less: Accumulated depreciation (813) (13,188) (17,410) $ 14,542 $ 39,742 $ 35,520 \n \n Depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment was approximately $813, $12,375, and $4,222 for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 and for the three months ended March 31, 2014, respectively. \n \n 3. Accrued Expenses and Other Payables \n \n Accrued expenses and other payables consist of the following: \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Three Months Ended \n \n March 31, 2014 2012 2013 (unaudited) Accruals and Other Payables Accrued Expenses $ 6,476 $ 192,076 $ 55,139 Deferred Rent Liability 4,552 19,911 19,076 Accrued Salary \u0097 34,320 \u0097 $ 11,028 $ 246,307 $ 74,215 \n \n 4. Loan \n \n In October 2013, the Company entered into a Loan & Security Agreement with Venture Lending & Leasing, which made $500,000 available to the Company, all of which had been drawn down by the Company as of December 31, 2013. The facility is used for working capital purposes and bears interest at the rate of 11%. The agreement also contains restrictive covenants, including financial reporting requirements. The terms and conditions of the loan required repayments to start in April 2014 and shall be repaid in thirty (30) equal monthly payments of principal plus interest. Interest expense related to borrowings under the line of credit \n \n F-66 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n amounted to $13,349 and $12,125 during the year ended December 31, 2013 and the three months ended March 31, 2014, respectively. \n \n In connection with the borrowing, the Company issued warrants to purchase 92,242 and 92,243 shares of Series Seed preferred stock at exercise prices of $0.2918 per share. The warrants expire in October 2023. \n \n At issuance at October 22, 2013, at December 31, 2013 and at March 31, 2014, the warrants were valued at $46,098, $56,844 and $70,137, respectively, using an option pricing model. Key assumptions at October 22, 2013, December 31, 2013 and March 31, 2014 included a remaining term of 10 years, 9.8 years and 9.5 years, respectively, and a volatility of 83.74% based on a group of comparable companies and a risk-free interest rate of 2.54 - 2.98%. \n \n The Company recorded the initial value of the warrants as debt discount of the loan and recorded $4,610 as an expense in 2013 in connection with the debt discount amortization. In addition, $1,123 was incurred as debt issuance costs. As the warrants are exercisable into Series Seed preferred stock, which include certain redemption rights that are considered outside of the control of the Company, in accordance with ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, the warrants are accounted for as a liability and are revalued at each balance sheet date. The warrants were fully vested at issuance. \n \n The fair value of the loan was not materially different from its carrying value as interest rates have not changed materially since the loan was entered into. \n \n Annual maturities of the loan are as follows: \n \n Year Ending December 31, 2014 $ 135,908 2015 199,476 2016 164,616 500,000 Less : Unamortized discount (42,611) Plus : Interest accrued & unpaid 13,348 470,737 Less : Current maturities (135,908) Long term maturities $ 334,829 \n \n 5. Capital Stock \n \n As of December 31, 2012, the Company had been authorized to issue 20,039,629 shares of stock, at a par value of $0.00001 per share, consisting of 15,500,000 shares of common stock and 4,539,629 shares of preferred stock. The Company has 3,391,581 shares of preferred stock and 8,700,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2013 and March 31, 2014, the Company had been \n \n F-67 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n authorized to issue 20,416,641 shares of stock, at a par value of $0.00001 per share, consisting of 15,688,486 shares of common stock and 4,728,155 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2013, the Company has 4,419,683 shares of preferred stock and 8,700,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. \n \n Dividend \n \n The holders of shares of preferred stock shall be entitled to receive dividends, out of any assets legally available, prior and in preference to any declaration or payment of any dividend on the common stock of this corporation and at the applicable dividend rate, as declared by the board of directors. Such dividends shall not be cumulative. The holders of the outstanding preferred stock can waive any dividend preference that such holders shall be entitled to receive upon the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of a majority of the shares of preferred stock then outstanding (voting together as a single class and not as a separate series, and on an as-converted basis). The dividend rate is $0.0233 per annum for each share of the Series Seed preferred stock (as adjusted for any stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, subdivisions, recapitalizations or the like). The Company has not declared or paid any dividends. \n \n Liquidation \n \n Unless the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of the preferred stock, voting together as a single class and on an as-converted basis, elect otherwise in writing, each of the following transactions shall be deemed a \u0093Liquidation Event\u0094: \n \n a. A merger or consolidation in which the Company is the constituent party or its subsidiary is the constituent party and the Company issues shares of its capital stock pursuant to such a merger or consolidation, with stipulations; \n \n b. The sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition, in one transaction or series of related transactions, by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company of all or substantially all the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, except where such sale, lease, transfer, exclusive license or other disposition is to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company; \n \n In the event of any Liquidation Event, the holders of each share of preferred stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, out of the available funds and assets, and prior and in preference to any payment or distribution to the holders of common stock, an amount per share equal to the liquidation amount for each such series of preferred stock plus all declared but unpaid dividends thereon. \n \n F-68 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n Conversion \n \n The holders of the preferred stock have the right to convert at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into such number of fully paid and nonassessible shares of common stock as is determined by dividing the original issue price for the preferred stock by the conversion price at the time of the conversion. \n \n The preferred stock will be automatically converted into common stock upon a qualified initial public offering, which will result in at least $30 million of proceeds. \n \n 6. Stock-Based Compensation \n \n The Company has a 2012 Stock and Option Grant Plan (the \u0093Plan\u0094) under which the Company may grant stock options for up to 1,466,488 shares of common stock. Stock options expire either four or ten years from the date of the grant. For initial grants, vesting occurs over either (i) two years, with vesting occurring immediately each month, or (ii) four years, with the first 25% of the awards vesting twelve months after the vesting commencement date and the remaining 75% of the awards vesting monthly over the next thirty-six months. The Company\u0092s policy for attributing the value of stock-based compensation is on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. \n \n During 2013 and 2012 no options were exercised. At December 31, 2013, there were 1,116,360 shares available for grant under the Plan. \n \n The fair value for options and share awards granted under the Plan are estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following range of assumptions were used for grants during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the three months ended March 31, 2014: \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Three Months Ended \n \n March 31, 2014 2012 2013 Risk-free interest rates 0.74% 0.62% \u0096 1.91% 0.80% Expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Expected term 6.25 years 3.03 \u0096 5.75 years 3.25 years Volatility 188.8% 144.0% 143% \n \n F-69 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n The impact on recording stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2013 and the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2014 was as follows: \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Three Months Ended \n \n March 31, 2012 2013 2013 2014 (Unaudited) Sales and marketing $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 $ \u0097 Product and technology 1,023 6,249 772 3,988 General and administrative \u0097 \u0097 \u0097 \u0097 Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 1,023 $ 6,249 $ 772 $ 3,988 \n \n The following table summarizes the stock option activity: \n \n Total \n \n Options \n \n Outstanding Weighted \n \n Average \n \n Exercise \n \n Price Weighted \n \n Average \n \n Remaining \n \n Contractual \n \n Term Outstanding at December 31, 2011 Options granted 100,000 $ 0.0001 Options exercised \u0097 \u0097 Options forfeited \u0097 \u0097 Outstanding at December 31, 2012 100,000 0.0001 8.68 Options granted 250,128 0.10 Options exercised \u0097 \u0097 Options forfeited \u0097 \u0097 Outstanding at December 31, 2013 350,128 0.07 5.41 Options granted 110,220 0.10 Options exercised \u0097 \u0097 Options forfeited \u0097 \u0097 Outstanding at March 31, 2014 460,348 0.08 4.83 Exercisable at December 31, 2013 33,333 $ 0.0001 5.41 Vested and expected to vest at December 31, 2013 350,128 $ 0.07 5.41 \n \n The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the three months ended March 31, 2014 was $25,013, $10,231 and $26,453, respectively. \n \n The stock compensation expense for employee awards was $5,923, $1,023, $3,541 and $772 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The stock compensation expense for non-employee awards was $326, $0, $447 and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. As of \n \n F-70 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n December 31, 2013, there was $28,143 of unrecognized stock compensation expense related to non-vested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 8.68 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $3,333 and $0, respectively. \n \n 7. Commitments and Contingencies \n \n In 2013, the Company entered into a new lease for office space in New York, NY expiring in 2016. Rent expense for the operating lease is recognized over the term of the lease on a straight line basis. Total rent for this lease for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013 is $80,411, $0, $19,076 and $6,353, respectively. \n \n Operating 2014 $ 134,400 2015 138,559 2016 52,515 2017 \u0097 2018 \u0097 Total minimum payments required: $ 325,474 \n \n From time to time, the Company is involved in disputes or legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company believes that there is no dispute or litigation pending that could have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \n \n 8. Income Taxes \n \n The significant components of the Company\u0092s deferred tax assets are as follows: \n \n 2012 2013 Net operating loss $ 59,514 $ 479,178 Fixed Assets 139 2,151 Stock based compensation 439 4,098 Other \u0097 \u0097 Deferred tax assets before valuation allowance 60,092 485,427 Less: Valuation allowance (60,092) (485,427) Total deferred tax assets $ \u0097 $ \u0097 \n \n As of December 31, 2012 and 2013, the Company had a net operating loss carry-forward of approximately $140 thousand and $1.1 million available to reduce future taxable income. \n \n F-71 \n \n Jarvis Labs, Inc. \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n The Company follows ASC 740, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2012 and 2013, there were no uncertain tax positions. As of December 31, 2012 and 2013, the Company was subject to federal and state income tax in the United States. Since the Company is in a loss carry-forward position, the Company is generally subject to U.S. federal and state income tax examinations by tax authorities for all years for which a loss carry-forward is available. It is the Company\u0092s policy to record interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. No amounts of interest or penalties were recognized in the financial statements upon adoption of this guidance as of and for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. \n \n 9. Subsequent Events \n \n The Company has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through November 3, 2014, the date of issuance of these financial statements. \n \n In April 2014, the Company was acquired by Etsy, Inc. \n \n F-72 \n \n Independent Auditor\u0092s Report \n \n To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Incubart SAS: \n \n We have audited the accompanying statements of Incubart SAS which comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related statements of income and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements. \n \n Management\u0092s Responsibility for the Financial Statements \n \n Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in France; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \n \n Auditor\u0092s Responsibility \n \n Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. \n \n An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on our judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, we consider internal control relevant to the Company\u0092s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u0092s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. \n \n F-73 \n \n Opinion \n \n In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Incubart SAS at December 31, 2013 and 2012 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in France. \n \n Emphasis of matter \n \n Accounting principles generally accepted in France vary in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Description of business \n \n Incubart SAS (the \u0093Company\u0094) was incorporated in Paris in March 2009. Incubart owns and operates among other websites, alittlemarket.com and alittlemercerie.com, websites that provide a marketplace for the purchase and sale of handmade goods and commercial supplies. The Company generates revenue primarily from commissions on sales and seller advertising fees. \n \n The Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with: \n \n \u0095 PCG 1999, approved by ministerial order on June 22, 1999 \n \n \u0095 Law number 83 353 of April 30, 1983 \n \n \u0095 Decree 83 1020 of November 29, 1983 \n \n \u0095 Accounting standards arising from the Authority de Normes Comptables (ANC) \n \n The financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis. The notes and tables below form an integral part of the annual accounts. \n \n 2. Significant events \n \n In 2012, the Company launched two new platforms: A Little Maman, dedicated to nursery items and A Little Market in Italy. \n \n In 2013, the Company launched one new platform, A Little Epicerie, dedicated to Food. \n \n With regards to product features, the Company has launched two major features: the multishop basket and the installment payment service. \n \n 3. Revenue recognition \n \n Revenue is mainly generated from commissions on sales made by listed sellers and from the sale of advertising on the Company\u0092s website. \n \n The main line of revenue is transaction fees, which include commissions on orders placed by purchasers on the Company\u0092s websites and payment processing fees charged when the buyer pays with a credit card through the Company\u0092s secured system. \n \n F-80 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n In accordance with its terms of business, the Company has no responsibility in the fulfillment of orders placed by buyers and earns a fixed commission per transaction. Based on the aforementioned factors, revenue is recorded net of amounts collected from buyers and remitted to sellers. Seller refunds are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. \n \n Transaction fees\u0097The Company earns a commission on sales made between the seller and their buyer. Revenue from commissions on sales is recognized when the transaction is successfully completed, which occurs when a buyer purchases the item on the website with their credit card or their e-wallet. \n \n Advertising fees\u0097The Company offers search advertising where sellers can advertise their items based on featured search results. The advertising fees are recognized as revenue when purchased by the sellers. \n \n 4. Intangible assets \n \n Intangible assets, consisting principally of website and purchased software, are carried at cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally on a straight-line basis over three years. The Company reviews its identifiable amortizable intangible assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Measurement of any impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. \n \n 5. Research and development \n \n From the commencement of financial year 2012, development of software for internal use has been expensed as incurred. Prior to 2012, certain development costs, primarily relating to third party developers, had been capitalized. \n \n 6. Property and equipment \n \n Property and equipment, consisting principally of computer equipment and different fittings, are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. \n \n The depreciation rate of the main assets are the following: \n \n \u0095 Website Development Costs: 5 years \n \n \u0095 Computer Hardware: 3 to 5 years \n \n F-81 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n 7. Accounts receivable \n \n The Company\u0092s trade accounts receivable are recorded at amounts billed to customers and presented on the balance sheet net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is determined by a number of factors, including age of the receivable, current economic conditions, historical losses and management\u0092s assessment of the financial condition of customers. Receivables are written off once they are deemed uncollectible, which may arise when customers file for bankruptcy or are otherwise deemed unable to repay the amounts owed to the Company. \n \n 8. Provisions \n \n Provisions for liabilities are made in accordance with rule CRC 2000-06. \n \n Provisions for risks and expenses are recorded to take account of probable future sacrifices or outflows of economic benefits arising from present obligations and which result from past transactions. \n \n These provisions are estimated based on consideration of the best available information known to management at the year-end closing date. \n \n 9. Purchased gift vouchers \n \n The Company recognizes a liability for gift cards purchased on its websites. Under French generally accepted accounting principles (\u0093French GAAP\u0094), the Company records cash received against a liability, which is released to the income statement when the voucher expires or is redeemed. When a customer uses the purchased gift vouchers, the related commission is recognized as revenue. If a purchased gift card expires unused, a gain is recognized in the income statement. \n \n As at December 31, 2013, the liability was estimated at EUR 13,947, compared with EUR 11,306 as at December 31, 2012. \n \n 10. Free gift vouchers \n \n The Company may decide to grant free gift vouchers to buyers on a discretionary basis as sales incentives. These vouchers are not offered in connection with a current transaction, but rather as an incentive for future purchases. The Company records these as a discount on a future sale at the time of redemption. \n \n 11. Cash and cash equivalents \n \n The Company considers all investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. \n \n F-82 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n Short term investments amount to EUR 670,000 as at December 31, 2013 and EUR 1,050,000 as at December 31, 2012. \n \n 12. Restricted cash \n \n When a purchaser pays through the Incubart secured system, the funds are put in an escrow account until remitted to the merchant, after deduction of commission and processing fees. The restricted cash balance of the dedicated bank account is presented within Cash at bank and in hand and amounts to EUR 1,042,491 as at December 31, 2013 (2012 : EUR 476,448). \n \n The corresponding liability towards the listed sellers is recorded under \u0093Other creditors\u0094 in the balance sheet. \n \n 13. Accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates \n \n There were no changes in the methods of evaluation during the course of the financial year. \n \n There were no changes in the presentation of the financial statements during the course of the financial year. \n \n 14. Pensions \n \n The Company\u0092s defined benefit obligation is only the French statutory lump sum payment. The projected benefit obligation is not material for the financial years 2013 and 2012 (EUR 14,043 and EUR 6,447, respectively). \n \n 15. Taxes \n \n Deferred taxes are not recognized on the face of the balance sheet in the statutory financial statements. \n \n 16. Competitiveness and employment tax credit (CICE) \n \n This tax credit was enacted from January 1, 2013 and amounts to EUR 15,527 at December 31, 2013. This will be collected by the Company in cash independently of its future taxable result. \n \n 17. Foreign currency translations \n \n The Company\u0092s revenue and expenses are essentially transacted in Euros, and its assets and liabilities are all denominated in Euros, which is the functional currency of the Company. \n \n F-83 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n 18. Stock-based compensation \n \n No stock options, warrants or other equity instruments have been issued to any employees, directors, related parties or other third parties. \n \n 19. Credit agreements \n \n On October 8, 2012, the Company entered into an interest-free credit agreement with OSEO of EUR 450,000, of which EUR 360,000 had been drawn down as at December 31, 2013 (2012: Nil). \n \n The loan is repayable quarterly, at an average of EUR 28,000 per quarter, beginning December 31, 2016, with a minimum of EUR 160,000 to be repaid. There is a clause in the agreement which allows for a penalty-free early repayment, at any time, of the loan in full. \n \n On July 30, 2012, the Company entered into an interest-free agreement with COFACE. The agreement is intended to finance marketing development initiatives undertaken in foreign markets. As at December 31, 2013, the amount drawn down totaled EUR 52,079. The Company is obliged to pay back either 14% of the turnover generated from foreign sales, or a maximum of the amount of the loan drawn down, whichever is lower, dating 12 months after the export-related project is considered concluded by management and COFACE is informed. \n \n 20. Related party transactions \n \n There are no related party transactions for 2012 and 2013. \n \n 21. Segment reporting information \n \n The Company operates solely in France and in Italy for 2012 and 2013. \n \n 22. Subsequent events \n \n The Company was acquired in full by Etsy, Inc., a U.S.-based company, on June 18, 2014. \n \n F-84 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n Note 2\u0097Fixed Assets \n \n Financial Year 2012 \n \n (all amounts in Euros) \n \n Gross amount \n \n opening \n \n balance Acquisitions Disposals Gross amount \n \n closing \n \n balance Intangible assets Other intangible assets 32,315 9,000 41,315 TOTAL 32,315 9,000 41,315 Tangible assets Plant, machinery and equipment Other fixtures and fittings 3,880 3,880 Vehicles Office equipment, computer hardware, furniture 5,101 9,487 14,588 TOTAL 5,101 13,367 18,468 Financial assets Deposits 6,435 74,830 81,265 TOTAL 6,435 74,830 81,265 GRAND TOTAL 43,851 97,197 141,048 \n \n Financial Year 2013 \n \n (all amounts in Euros) \n \n Gross amount \n \n opening \n \n balance Acquisitions Disposals Gross amount \n \n closing \n \n balance Intangible assets Other intangible assets 41,315 22,283 63,598 TOTAL 41,315 22,283 63,598 Tangible assets Plant, machinery and equipment Other fixtures and fittings 3,880 3,880 Vehicles Office equipment, computer hardware, furniture 14,588 12,548 27,136 TOTAL 18,468 12,548 31,016 Financial assets Deposits 81,265 6,435 74,830 TOTAL 81,265 6,435 74,830 GRAND TOTAL 141,048 34,831 6,435 169,444 \n \n F-85 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n Note 3\u0097Depreciation \n \n Financial Year 2012 \n \n (all amounts in Euros) \n \n Opening \n \n balance Additional \n \n allowances Reductions \n \n dispo./Rever.

However, tax credits have been recorded by the Company as follows: \n \n \u0095 R&D tax credit 2013: EUR 109,899 and 2012: EUR 185,196 \n \n \u0095 CICE 2013 (Competitiveness and employment tax credit): EUR 15,527 \n \n The amounts of accumulated losses carried forward are EUR 973,780 as at December 31, 2012 and EUR 1,547,358 as at December 31, 2013, respectively. \n \n Note 12\u0097Reconciliation to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles \n \n The Company\u0092s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with French accounting standards, which differ in certain material respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u0093US GAAP\u0094). Such differences involve methods for measuring the amounts in the financial statements. The \n \n F-91 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n principal differences between French accounting standards and US GAAP applicable to the Company are quantified and described below: \n \n Reconciliation of net income (French GAAP\u0097US GAAP) \n \n (all amounts in Euros) \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Note 2012 2013 (in thousands) Loss reported under French GAAP (420.2) (466.5) Software and website development costs A 97.2 104.0 Revenue recognition (advertising fees) B (14.9) (22.0) Debt issuance costs C 11.4 Interest free loan D 6.4 Deferred payment terms E (8.0) Deferred tax effect of US GAAP adjustments F Loss reported under US GAAP (337.9) (374.7) \n \n Reconciliation of equity (French GAAP\u0097US GAAP) \n \n (all amounts in Euros) \n \n Year Ended \n \n December 31, Note 2012 2013 (in thousands) Equity reported under French GAAP 1,310.8 844.3 Software and website development costs A 298.7 402.8 Revenue recognition (advertising fees) B (41.7) (63.7) Debt issuance costs C 11.4 Interest-free loan D 6.4 Deferred payment terms E (8.0) Deferred tax effect of US GAAP adjustments F Equity reported under US GAAP 1,567.8 1,193.2 \n \n A. Software and website development costs \n \n Software and website development is performed by external service providers as well as the Company\u0092s employees. Under French GAAP, the company capitalized only website development fees charged by third-party service providers up until December 31, 2011. Starting in 2012, all software development costs were expensed. US GAAP requires capitalization of certain internal and external costs incurred in the development of websites and software for internal use. \n \n Costs of the preliminary design phase and costs incurred in the operation and maintenance of the software must be expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the development phase must be capitalized. These \n \n F-92 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n same rules apply to upgrades and enhancements made to the platform, to the extent it is probable that they will result in additional functionalities to the platform. \n \n B. Revenue recognition \n \n The Company recognizes fees charged to listed sellers for more prominently displaying their products. Under French GAAP, the fees are recognized upfront in the income statement. \n \n Under US GAAP, this search advertisement revenue is recognized as \u0093impressions\u0094 (i.e., the number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of the Company\u0092s website) are delivered. \n \n C. Debt issuance costs \n \n A transaction fee was charged in connection with a financing received in fiscal year 2013. Under French GAAP, the fee is recorded in operating expenses. \n \n Under US GAAP, the fee should be capitalized as debt issuance costs and amortized to the income statement using an effective interest rate method. \n \n D. Government grants in the form of an interest-free loan \n \n In fiscal year 2013, the Company drew down an interest-free loan from a government body. Under French GAAP, the liability is equal to the amount of proceeds received and is not discounted to its net present value. \n \n US GAAP requires the Company to impute interest when the stated interest rate of a note payable or receivable is below market rate in accordance with the substance of the transaction. The substance of this transaction is a government subsidy for an amount equivalent to the difference between proceeds received and fair value of the note (NPV of cash flows using a market interest rate). \n \n E. Deferred payment terms \n \n During fiscal year 2013, the Company began to allow buyers to elect to pay in 3 monthly installments, in which case the Company bears credit risk and charges the buyer an additional fee. Under French GAAP, the fee was recognized upfront in the income statement. \n \n Under US GAAP, the fee is considered, in substance, as interest income and is recognized using an effective interest method over the term of the receivable. \n \n F-93 \n \n Incubart SAS \n \n Notes to the Financial Statements \n \n F. Income taxes \n \n Under French GAAP, deferred taxes are not recognized in the statutory financial statements. \n \n Under US GAAP, deferred tax is computed on all temporary differences between the tax bases and book values of assets and liabilities which will result in taxable or tax deductible amounts arising in future years. Deferred taxes are measured at enacted rates. The Company records deferred tax assets, primarily in connection with their net operating losses, up to an amount that is offset by the deferred tax liabilities, primarily associated with the differences between their book and tax basis for capitalized software and website development costs. As a result of the Company\u0092s history of losses, a full valuation allowance is applied against any remaining net deferred tax assets, as the realization of the future benefit is not more likely than not. \n \n Net deferred tax assets prior to the valuation allowance under U.S. GAAP were EUR 85,655 for 2012 and EUR 116,290 for 2013. \n \n Reconciliation of operating expenses \n \n The following table presents the disclosure of costs and expenses based on the caption requirements of Rule 5-03 of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Such costs and expenses have been allocated from the French GAAP presentation, and adjusted for US GAAP reconciliation items accordingly. \n \n 2013 2012 (in Euros) Cost of revenue 477,609 269,818 Marketing 530,838 456,961 Product development 543,102 212,645 General and administrative 350,986 318,726 Operating expenses 1,902,535 1,258,150 \n \n Reconciliation of operating expenses from French GAAP to US GAAP \n \n 2013 2012 (in Euros) Operating expenses - French GAAP 2,060,339 1,403,787 US GAAP adjustments: Other operating expense (1) (42,359) (48,427) Software and website development costs (104,022) (97,210) Debt issuance costs (11,423) \u0097 Operating expenses\u0097US GAAP 1,902,535 1,258,150 \n \n (1) These represent other operating income and reversal of provisions and cost recharges that should be reflected within operating expense under U.S. GAAP, but are included in operating income under French GAAP. \n \n F-94 \n \n Unaudited Combined Pro Forma Financial Information \n \n On April 29, 2014, Etsy, Inc. (the \u0093Company\u0094) completed the acquisition of Jarvis Labs, Inc., owners of the \u0093Grand St.\u0094 online technology marketplace. Total consideration for the acquisition was approximately $3.2 million, consisting of $1.0 million in cash and 425,104 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock with a fair value of $2.2 million on the acquisition date. Additionally, the Company issued 657,160 shares of common stock with a fair value of $3.4 million on the acquisition date, which are tied to continued employment with the Company and are being accounted for as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense over the three-year vesting period. \n \n On June 18, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Incubart SAS, a societe par actions simplifiee organized under the laws of France, which operates the online marketplace A Little Market (\u0093ALM\u0094). Total consideration for the acquisition was $30.8 million, consisting of $5.3 million in cash, of which $4.2 million was paid at closing, $0.3 million will be paid in March 2015 and $0.8 million in February 2016, and 4,879,693 shares of the Company\u0092s common stock with a fair value of $25.5 million on the acquisition date. The terms of the purchase agreement provide for the sale of put options to certain of the former shareholders of ALM. The put options enable the holders of the options to sell up to all of their shares back to the Company, subject to certain vesting and restrictions, at fair value, but not to exceed $4.13 per share and not less than $2.00 per share. The put right terminates with respect to a share on the earlier of one year from when such share is vested or the liquidation date, as defined in the agreement containing the put option. The holders of the options paid an aggregate of $0.1 million cash to the Company at the date of acquisition and the Company recorded a $0.1 million liability for the fair value of the put option at the time. Additionally, the Company issued 1,198,995 shares of common stock with a fair value of $6.3 million on the acquisition date, which are tied to continued employment with the Company and are being accounted for as post-acquisition stock-based compensation expense over the three-year vesting period. Since the put options relate in part to these shares, these shares will be recorded as liability-classified stock awards as earned. \n \n The historical financial information for Etsy is derived from the Company\u0092s audited consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 2014 contained in this prospectus. The historical financial information of Grand St. and ALM has been derived from the historical audited financial statements and the unaudited financial statements of Grand St. and ALM for the period from January 1, 2014 through April 29, 2014 and the period from January 1, 2014 through June 18, 2014, respectively. The financial statements for Grand St. were prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The financial statements for ALM were prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in France (French GAAP) which is a comprehensive basis of accounting different from U.S. GAAP. The historical ALM French GAAP financial statements have been reconciled to U.S. GAAP and, as a result, the historical financial information of ALM included in the pro forma combined statement of operations is presented in U.S. GAAP. \n \n F-95 \n \n The ALM historical EUR denominated financial statement amounts have been translated to U.S. Dollars (USD) using the following exchange rates: \n \n EUR / $ Interim period ended June 18, 2014 Average spot rate 1.3716 \n \n The unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 give effect to the acquisitions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2014. \n \n The unaudited pro forma adjustments have been made for informational purposes. The actual results reported by the combined company in periods following the acquisitions may differ significantly from those reflected in these unaudited pro forma combined statements. As a result, the pro forma combined information is not intended to represent and does not purport to be indicative of what the combined company\u0092s financial condition or results of operations would have been had the acquisitions been completed on the applicable dates of this pro forma combined financial information. In addition, the pro forma combined financial information does not purport to project the future financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. \n \n The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are based on various assumptions, including consideration paid and the allocation thereof to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Grand St. and ALM are based on preliminary estimates of fair value. The pro forma assumptions and adjustments are described in the accompanying notes presented on the following pages. Pro forma adjustments are those that are directly attributable to the transactions, are factually supportable and, with respect to the unaudited pro forma combined statements of operations, are expected to have a continuing impact on the consolidated results. The final purchase price and the allocation thereof may differ from that reflected in the pro forma combined financial statements after the final valuation procedures are performed and amounts are finalized. \n \n The unaudited pro forma combined financial information does not reflect any cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies or other restructuring that could result from the acquisition. \n \n F-96 \n \n Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statement of Operations for the Year Ended \n \n December 31, 2014 \n \n (In thousands except share and per share data) \n \n Etsy, Inc.

Fair value is defined in the guidance as \u0093the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\u0094 This is an exit price concept for the valuation of the asset or liability. In addition, market participants are assumed to be buyers and sellers in the principal (or the most advantageous) market for the asset or liability. Fair value measurements for an asset assume the highest and best use by these market participants. Many of these fair value measurements can be highly subjective and it is possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. \n \n The pro forma adjustments described below have been developed based on assumptions and estimates, including assumptions relating to the consideration paid and the allocation thereof to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from Grand St. and ALM based on preliminary estimates of fair value. The final purchase price and the allocation thereof may differ from that reflected in the pro forma combined financial statements after final valuation procedures are performed and amounts are finalized. The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are provided for illustrative purposes only and do not purport to represent what the actual consolidated results of operations would have been had the acquisition occurred on the dates assumed, nor are they necessarily indicative of future consolidated results of operations. \n \n The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements do not reflect any cost savings from operating efficiencies, synergies or other restructurings that could result from the acquisition, as such costs are not currently factually supportable. \n \n F-98 \n \n Management performed a review of Grand St.\u0092s and ALM\u0092s accounting policies, based primarily on available historical financial information, to determine whether any adjustments were necessary to ensure comparability in the pro forma combined financial statements. At this time, the Company is not aware of any differences, other than those stated in either in the unaudited pro forma adjustments or identified in the Grand St. or ALM stand-alone financial statements provided elsewhere in this prospectus, which would have a material impact on the pro forma combined financial statements. \n \n Note 2\u0097Purchase Price Allocation \n \n This business combinations resulted in the total purchase price being allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed according to their estimated fair values at the date of acquisitions with the remaining unallocated purchase price recorded as goodwill as follows: \n \n Grand St. (in thousands) \n \n Cash paid $ 1,040 Common shares 2,202 Total purchase consideration $ 3,242 Working capital $ 85 Developed technology 2,000 Customer relationships 600 Trademarks 200 Goodwill 991 Deferred tax liability (634) Net assets acquired $ 3,242 \n \n Included in working capital is approximately $0.1 million of cash acquired. \n \n The amounts allocated to developed technology, customer relationships and trademark (the acquired intangible assets) total $2.8 million. The fair value assigned to developed technology was determined primarily using the cost approach, which estimates the cost to reproduce the asset, adjusted for loss due to functional and economic obsolescence. The fair value of Grand St.\u0092s customer relationships was determined primarily using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. The fair value assigned to trademark was determined using the relief from royalty method, where the owner of the asset realizes a benefit from owning the intangible asset rather than paying a rental or royalty rate for use of the asset. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years, which approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized. None of the goodwill recorded in the acquisition is deductible for tax purposes. \n \n F-99 \n \n ALM (in thousands) \n \n Cash paid $ 5,290 Common shares 25,521 Total purchase consideration $ 30,811 Working capital $ 625 Property and equipment and other assets 95 Developed technology 1,636 Customer relationships 1,693 Trademarks 775 Goodwill 27,309 Deferred tax liability (757) Other long-term liabilities (565) Net assets acquired $ 30,811 \n \n Included in working capital is approximately $0.5 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired. \n \n The amount allocated to developed technology, customer relationships and trademarks (the acquired intangible assets) total $4.1 million. The fair value assigned to developed technology was determined primarily by using the cost approach, which estimates the cost to reproduce the asset, adjusted for loss due to functional and economic obsolescence. The fair value of ALM\u0092s customer relationships was determined primarily by using the income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value using estimates and assumptions determined by management. The fair value assigned to trademark was determined using the relief from royalty method, where the owner of the asset realizes a benefit from owning the intangible asset rather than paying a rental or royalty rate for use of the asset. The acquired identifiable intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over three years, which approximates the pattern in which the assets are utilized. Goodwill of $27.3 million, none of which is deductible for tax purposes, was recorded in connection with this acquisition, which is primarily attributed to synergies arising from the acquisition and the value of the acquired workforce. \n \n Note 3\u0097Unaudited Pro Forma Adjustments \n \n (1) Pro forma adjustment to record additional amortization expense related to Grand St. and ALM acquired identifiable intangible assets, net of historical amortization amounts of $11,000, as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2014 and amortization of the acquired assets is recorded on a straight-line basis over three years. \n \n Intangible assets acquired are as follows (in thousands): \n \n Grand St. ALM Developed technology $ 2,000 $ 1,636 Trademarks 200 775 Customer relationships 600 1,693 $ 2,800 $ 4,104 \n \n F-100 \n \n Amortization of developed technology and trademark is recorded within cost of revenue. Customer relationship amortization is recorded within marketing expense. \n \n (2) Pro forma adjustment to eliminate acquisition costs relating to the purchase of Grand St. and ALM in 2014. \n \n (3) Pro forma adjustment to eliminate interest expense on debt that was not acquired by Etsy. \n \n (4) For purposes of this unaudited combined pro forma financial information, the 425,104 and 4,879,693 shares of non-compensatory common stock issued to Grand St. and ALM shareholders, respectively, was given effect in the computation of basic and diluted net income per share for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 as if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2013. \n \n In addition, the conversion of all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock into 106,896,493 shares of common stock is assumed to have occurred on January 1, 2013. \n \n (5) Pro forma adjustment to record stock compensation expense in connection with the issuance of 1,198,995 shares of common stock valued at $6.3 million to certain former shareholders of ALM and 657,160 shares of common stock valued at $3.4 million to certain former shareholders of Grand St. that are tied to continuing employment. \n \n (6) Pro forma adjustment to reflect the effect of the assumed conversions of outstanding warrants exercisable for preferred securities of the Company and Grand St. into warrants exercisable for common stock and the corresponding elimination of the expense included in operating results from the change in the fair value of the warrants. \n \n F-101 \n \n Part II \n \n Information Not Required in Prospectus \n \n Item 13.

Except as otherwise noted, all the expenses below will be paid by us. \n \n SEC registration fee $ * FINRA filing fee * Nasdaq listing fee * Printing and engraving expenses * Legal fees and expenses * Accounting fees and expenses * Transfer agent and registrar fees * Miscellaneous fees and expenses * Total $ * \n \n * To be completed by amendment. \n \n Item 14. Indemnification of Directors and Officers \n \n Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law authorizes a court to award, or a corporation\u0092s board of directors to grant, indemnity to directors and officers under certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations. The terms of Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law are sufficiently broad to permit indemnification under certain circumstances for liabilities, including reimbursement of expenses incurred, arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. \n \n As permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law, upon completion of this offering, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will contain provisions relating to the limitation of liability and indemnification of directors and officers. The amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability: \n \n \u0095 for any breach of the director\u0092s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders; \n \n \u0095 for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; \n \n \u0095 in respect of unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or \n \n \u0095 for any transaction from which the director derives any improper personal benefit. \n \n II-1 \n \n Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that if Delaware law is amended after the approval by our stockholders of the certificate of incorporation to authorize corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of our directors will be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. \n \n Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that we will indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, as it now exists or may in the future be amended, against all expenses and liabilities reasonably incurred in connection with their service for or on our behalf. Our amended and restated bylaws will provide that we shall advance the expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of an action or proceeding, and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any director, officer, employee or other enterprise agent for any liability arising out of his or her action in that capacity, whether or not Delaware law would otherwise permit indemnification. \n \n We intend to enter into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers, a form of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1. The form of agreement provides that we will indemnify each of our directors and officers against any and all expenses incurred by that director or officer because of his or her status as one of our directors or officers, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws. In addition, the form agreement provides that, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, we will advance all expenses incurred by our directors and officers in connection with a legal proceeding. \n \n Reference is made to the underwriting agreement contained in Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement, indemnifying our directors and officers against limited liabilities. In addition, Section 2(f) of our amended and restated investors\u0092 rights agreement contained in Exhibit 4.2 to this registration statement provides for indemnification of certain of our stockholders against liabilities described in that agreement. \n \n We currently carry and intend to continue to carry liability insurance for our directors and officers. \n \n Item 15. Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities \n \n The following sets forth information regarding all unregistered securities sold from January 1, 2012 to January 31, 2015, giving effect to a 10-for-1 forward split of our common stock, which occurred on May 5, 2011. \n \n On May 1, 2012, we issued and sold an aggregate of 11,594,203 shares of our Series F preferred stock to 12 accredited investors at $3.45 per share for an aggregate consideration of approximately $40,000,000. \n \n On June 26, 2012, we issued and sold 5,056 shares of our Series C preferred stock to one accredited investor upon exercise of a warrant issued to such investor on November 15, 2007. Pursuant to the terms of the warrant, the exercise price of $2.67 per share was paid through the cancellation of 425 shares of Series C preferred stock otherwise issuable under the warrant. \n \n II-2 \n \n We have granted options to purchase 22,320,456 shares of our common stock to service providers under our 2006 Stock Plan, with per share exercise prices ranging from $1.18 to $8.50. \n \n We have issued and sold an aggregate of 17,216,090 shares of our common stock upon exercise of options issued under our 2006 Stock Plan for aggregate consideration of approximately $14,810,000, with per share exercise prices ranging from $0.01 to $4.13. \n \n On April 1, 2014, we issued and sold an aggregate of 6,603,774 shares of our common stock to two accredited investors at $5.30 per share for an aggregate consideration of approximately $35,000,000. \n \n On January 30, 2015, we issued 376,471 shares of our common stock to Etsy.org for no consideration. \n \n We issued an aggregate of 7,160,952 shares of our common stock in connection with our acquisitions of certain companies or their assets and as consideration to individuals and entities who were former service providers and/or stockholders of such companies. \n \n None of the foregoing transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering. We believe that the offers, sales and issuances of the above securities were exempt from registration under the Securities Act by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act or Regulation D promulgated thereunder as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering, or in reliance on Rule 701 promulgated under Section 3(b) of the Securities Act because the transactions were pursuant to compensatory benefit plans or contracts relating to compensation as provided under Rule 701. The recipients of the securities in each of these transactions represented their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates issued in these transactions. We believe all recipients had adequate information about us or had adequate access, through their relationships with us, to information about us. \n \n Item 16. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules \n \n (a) Exhibits. We have filed the exhibits listed on the accompanying Index to Exhibits, which is incorporated herein by reference. \n \n (b) Financial Statement Schedules. All schedules have been omitted because the information required to be presented in them is not applicable or is shown in the consolidated financial statements or related notes. \n \n Item 17. Undertakings \n \n The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriter at the closing specified in the underwriting agreements certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriter to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser. \n \n II-3 \n \n Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. \n \n The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that: \n \n (1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective. \n \n (2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act, as amended, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. \n \n (3) In a primary offering of securities of the undersigned registrant pursuant to this registration statement, regardless of the underwriting method used to sell the securities to the purchaser, if the securities are offered or sold to such purchaser by means of any of the following communications, the undersigned registrant will be a seller to the purchaser and will be considered to offer or sell such securities to such purchaser: \n \n (i) Any preliminary prospectus or prospectus of the undersigned registrant relating to the offering required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; \n \n (ii) Any free writing prospectus relating to the offering prepared by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant or used or referred to by the undersigned registrant; \n \n (iii) The portion of any other free writing prospectus relating to the offering containing material information about the undersigned registrant or its securities provided by or on behalf of the undersigned registrant; and \n \n (iv) Any other communication that is an offer in the offering made by the undersigned registrant to the purchaser. \n \n II-4 \n \n Signatures \n \n Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of Brooklyn, State of New York, on this 4th day of March, 2015. \n \n ETSY, INC. /s/ Kristina Salen Kristina Salen Chief Financial Officer \n \n Power of Attorney \n \n KNOW ALL PERSONS BY THESE PRESENTS, that each person whose signature appears below hereby constitutes and appoints Chad Dickerson, Jordan Breslow and Kristina Salen, and each of them, as his or her true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent with full power of substitution, for him or her in any and all capacities, to sign any and all amendments to this registration statement (including post-effective amendments) and any registration statement related thereto filed pursuant to Rule 462(b) increasing the number of securities for which registration is sought, and to file the same, with all exhibits thereto and other documents in connection therewith, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, granting unto said attorney-in-fact and agent full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and thing requisite and necessary to be done in connection therewith, as fully for all intents and purposes as he or she might or could do in person, hereby ratifying and confirming all that said attorney-in-fact and agent, or his or her substitute, may lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. \n \n Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, this registration statement has been signed by the following persons in the capacities and on the dates indicated. \n \n Signature Title Date /s/ Chad Dickerson Chad Dickerson President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman (Principal Executive Officer) March 4, 2015 /s/ Kristina Salen Kristina Salen Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer) March 4, 2015 /s/ James W.

But as her business has grown, she has been harshly criticized online and accused of mass-producing goods, of obtaining wares from China. Detractors consider her a blight on Etsy\u2019s hipster cred. \n \n The dispute over how goods are produced and sold on a site that prides itself on feel-good, handmade authenticity underscores the growing pains transforming Etsy as it moves toward a potentially lucrative initial public offering of stock. \n \n As for Ms. Shaffer, she denies the claims that have dogged her business recently but says she understands why questions have arisen about the volume of goods she produces. She says her store strictly adheres to Etsy\u2019s guidelines, including that all items listed are either handmade or \u201cvintage\u201d secondhand, with some new exceptions that allow for approved outside manufacturing. \u201cWe\u2019re a team of dedicated Etsy artisans who have been able to grow a tiny shop into a little machine,\u201d she said. ||||| I shut down my Etsy store in November. \n \n I'd been a seller since April 2006, less than a year after Etsy first went into beta. I was in my first job out of journalism school, and making cards and journals was a creative outlet and a way for me to score some extra money. I'd been selling stuff on the side at craft shows for a few years at that point, part of a larger wave of modern crafters who met online and inspired each other to start businesses. \n \n Etsy debuted at just the right time: Indie craft shows had started popping up around the U.S. in the early 2000s, but running your own online store was a complicated task. (My \"store\" at the time encouraged buyers to mail me money orders.) Most of the people who joined Etsy in those first few years were like me\u2014independent crafters who were already at least somewhat established IRL\u2014and the quality of the goods on the site was generally high. \n \n Things have changed in the past decade: Indie craft has grown from a close-knit subculture to a giant economy that influences trends in big box stores. And Etsy has grown from a startup built by crafters and for crafters to a juggernaut on the verge of an IPO. The most recent success story of a mom making a million dollars a year isn't what it seems. In practical terms, scaling the handmade economy is an impossibility. So while Etsy maintains a hipster fa\u00e7ade, they lost their indie cred years ago. \n \n Grace Dobush About Grace Dobush is a freelance journalist in Cincinnati, where she writes about design, tech, politics and culture. She also organizes an indie craft show and wrote the Crafty Superstar craft business guides. Follow her gracedobushtogo. \n \n I have to acknowledge this: Modern craft would not be as hot as it is without Etsy or something like it. Like book authors who hate Amazon's policies, crafters who hate Etsy find it hard to leave because of the site's immense traffic and generally positive public reputation. Just before the Christmas rush, I finally put my money where my mouth is and shut down my shop. My reasons for leaving the site aren't unique, even though casual shoppers and potential investors have no idea of the drama going on behind the scenes. Here's my beef with Etsy. \n \n A Bigger Market Isn't a Better Market \n \n There are more than 30 million items listed on Etsy right now. That popularity is, of course, great for Etsy. But new hobbyist sellers, desperate for clicks, often price their products so low as to make real profit an impossible dream. \n \n And that popularity isn't good for shoppers, who have to wade through pages of crap to find what they're looking for. Searching for \"mermaid\" in the wedding gown category of Etsy returns 1,299 results, ranging from a $6,882 gown made by Project Runway's Leanne Marshall to dresses for less than $200, one purportedly handmade lace dress going for $65. (For those who aren't up to date on their fabric prices, the materials to make a wedding dress alone would cost at least $65.) A friend and I recently discovered we both always sort results by highest price when we're searching on Etsy to see only the serious sellers. \n \n What other e-commerce sites can say the same? Etsy needs casual crafters to keep paying the 20-cent listing fees and, if any of the items sell, the 3.5 percent transaction fees and any additional payment processing fees. (See \"She's Making Jewelry Now.\") Etsy doesn't disclose its finances, but it facilitated $1.35 billion in sales in 2013, which adds up to more than $47 million in transaction fees, not counting listing or payment processing fees. \n \n Resellers Are Rampant \n \n That Etsy began allowing manufacturing partners in 2013 underscored the reseller issue that has plagued the site for years. The Marketplace Integrity, Trust & Safety team\u2014which has the unenviable task of policing sellers for adherence to Etsy rules\u2014is unable or unwilling to weed out sellers of mass-manufactured goods. And having sellers who are able to move nearly a million dollars of product a year is great for Etsy's bottom line. \n \n Sellers have been dissatisfied with Etsy's policing of mass-manufactured items posing as handmade for a long time, but the site hasn't seemed receptive to their concerns. An Etsy staffer I met a few years ago dismissed sellers' questions about Chinese resellers as \"kind of racist.\" The snark site Regretsy (RIP) was one of the few big gathering places where sellers and shoppers could voice their frustrations with the marketplace. Any kind of \"calling out\" of accused resellers or bad businesspeople on Etsy's forums is usually acknowledged by an admin shutting down the thread with \"I'm going to close this up now.\" \n \n Etsy Has Homogenized Indie Craft \n \n From the beginning, Etsy has pushed the \"quit your day job\" storyline. The fact is, the majority of the people selling on Etsy aren't running their businesses full-time, and the idea of quitting your day job is a manic pixie fever dream. If you want to make it big on Etsy, you don't necessarily want to make things that fulfill your creative dreams; you just want it to get onto the front page and sell like hand-felted hotcakes. \n \n The Etsy effect on craft trends is striking. At the San Francisco edition of the Renegade Craft Fair in November, I was struck at how most things look like the homepage of Etsy, pinnable, pretty things. (See \"Put A Bird On It.\") It's so incredibly boring. How many pieces of geometric jewelry with a pop of color can the earth bear? Will we ever see hand-drawn logos without antlers and arrows? How much barn wood must we salvage to atone for our crafty sins? \n \n Successful Businesses Leave Etsy \n \n The biggest secret is this: Makers who have what it takes to succeed\u2014good product, a good marketing plan, a pricing structure that compensates everyone in their supply chain fairly\u2014don't really need Etsy for long. \n \n Etsy is the fifth most-visited marketplace site in the U.S., after Amazon, eBay, Walmart and Best Buy. But for that visibility, sellers have little autonomy in the store's design, and are subject to the site's rules, fees and design. A customer complaint can freeze your payment account. An accusation of copyright violation can freeze your store or shut it down entirely. \n \n For a full-time crafter, that's too much of a risk. Successful makers of a certain size eventually move to e-commerce platforms that give them much more flexibility and control for fewer fees. If you're working in high volume or high price points, using a customizable ecommerce platform such as Big Cartel or Shopify massively reduces your fee obligation, as I outlined in a comparison chart. \n \n I see the recent policy changes Etsy has made\u2014allowing third-party manufacturing partners, entering the wholesale space\u2014as last-ditch efforts to keep super-successful sellers using the site. But successful handmade businesspeople weren't waiting for permission from Etsy to hire help or get into wholesaling. They grew out of the site and took their wares elsewhere. \n \n The David Has Turned Into Goliath \n \n At its outset, Etsy was a powerful tool for makers, by makers. We were a bunch of Davids, fighting back against the big-box Goliaths with artisanal slingshots. Founder Rob Kalin came up through the same online craft forums that me and my crafty cohorts did, and we were making a revolution. \n \n In the past few years it's become apparent that Etsy is the Goliath. Indie craft's whole purpose from the outset was to meet your makers and consume conscientiously. Now, when you ask your friend where they got that cool \"Weekend at Bernies\" cross stitch sampler, they'll tell you, \"I bought it from Etsy\"\u2014the maker's identity is secondary, if noted at all. \n \n I'm not pessimistic about handmade culture at large: Maker culture is thriving independently of Etsy, and it's easier than ever for crafters to run independent online stores. I prefer to sell my wares (and buy my presents) at local indie craft markets and in curated bricks-and-mortar shops that reflect the flavor of their communities and encourage real relationships between makers and buyers. \n \n The bottom line is this: Etsy needs crafters more than crafters need Etsy. ||||| Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Etsy was born in 2005 in a Brooklyn loft as a way for one of its co-founders to sell his handmade wooden goods. \n \n Now the company is seeking to go public in what promises to be one of the more closely watched market debuts of the year. \n \n Etsy filed its first prospectus for an initial public offering on Wednesday, disclosing a preliminary fund-raising target of $100 million. But the online bazaar \u2014 whose wares range from whimsical knit \u201cbeard\u201d hats to vintage jewelry \u2014 will most likely seek much more. \n \n With the filing, Etsy is preparing to market itself to prospective investors in as soon as three weeks and could begin trading on the Nasdaq stock market by mid-April under the symbol ETSY. \n \n Unlike some of the other prominent companies that have gone public over the last six months, like the Alibaba Group of China or the online lender Lending Club, Etsy has quirkiness built into its DNA. Its first chief executive and co-founder, Rob Kalin, barely squeaked into college and came up with Etsy as a way to sell his homemade wares. (Its name, Mr. Kalin has said, arose from a misunderstanding of the Italian phrase \u201ceh, s\u00ec\u201d from the movie \u201c8 1/2.\u201d) \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cSince inception, Etsy has challenged conventional ways of thinking about commerce, business, individuals and communities,\u201d Chad Dickerson, the company\u2019s chief executive, wrote in a letter included in the prospectus. \u201cI intend to keep our unconventional operating philosophy as we become a public company, and I welcome new investors into our community.\u201d \n \n But its path to an initial offering has been rocky at times. Mr. Kalin stepped down as chief executive in 2011 and was succeeded by Mr. Dickerson, the chief technical officer at the time. \n \n And the company has been criticized for failing to adequately clamp down on the sale of counterfeit goods as well as for letting vendors sell products that come from factories instead of vintage finds or goods solely from artisanal workshops. \n \n Still, in its decade of existence, Etsy has become a significant business. It reported $195.6 million in sales last year, up 56 percent from the previous year. And as of Dec. 31, it had 685 employees, most of whom are still based in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn. \n \n Like other Internet companies that aim to go public, Etsy presents a measure of earnings that differs from that required by generally accepted accounting principles. Etsy\u2019s own metric, known as adjusted Ebitda, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, says that the company made $23 million last year. But it lost $15 million according to standard accounting principles. \n \n Adjusted Ebitda was positive because in addition to excluding taxes, depreciation and amortization, it did not count the cost of paying employees in stock. \n \n While investors often find such nonstandard measures of profits useful, they may be surprised at some of the items Etsy has left out of its particular metric. The company, for instance, also excluded acquisition-related expenses and foreign exchange losses. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n If those two items are included in the calculation, Etsy\u2019s underlying earnings growth would slow considerably. Specifically, the firm\u2019s adjusted Ebitda increased 36 percent in 2014, from $17 million in 2013. But if acquisition and foreign exchange costs were included, growth would have been only 6 percent. \n \n Other items in the filing may give investors pause. Etsy, for instance, said that it had 19.8 million \u201cactive buyers\u201d at the end of 2014. An active buyer doesn\u2019t have to be using Etsy frequently, though. The only requirement is to have made one purchase in the previous 12 months, according to the filing. \n \n Though the prospectus did not disclose details like how many of its shares are outstanding, it is possible to estimate market value. EBay trades at about 14 times its Ebitda for 2014. Applying that multiple to Etsy\u2019s adjusted Ebitda would give it a value of about $322 million. \n \n In his letter, Mr. Dickerson said that the company would not give quarterly or annual earnings guidance, numbers used by many public companies to steer analysts\u2019 expectations. \n \n Etsy\u2019s biggest existing shareholders include investment firms like Accel Partners, Index Ventures and Union Square Ventures. Together, the three control more than half of the company. The prospectus did not disclose how many shares any of the firms planned to sell. \n \n As part of the offering, Etsy plans to take about $300,000 of its proceeds from the I.P.O. to finance Etsy.org, a nonprofit it established in January to help train female entrepreneurs. \n \n The offering is being led by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.",

    "document": "Her letter, which was read in court defending Brock Turner, sparked national outrage from people who said it perpetuated rape culture and blamed victims \n \n A woman who blamed a Stanford University sexual assault victim for drinking too much alcohol has issued a defensive apology, marking the latest controversy surrounding an athlete who avoided prison time for attacking an unconscious woman. \n \n Leslie Rasmussen, a childhood friend of former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner, who was convicted of three felonies, wrote a letter to the judge saying that the assault was \u201ca huge misunderstanding\u201d, Turner is \u201cnot a monster\u201d, and that she thought it was unfair \u201cto base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn\u2019t remember anything\u201d. \n \n Stanford sexual assault: dozens of letters to judge urge leniency for Brock Turner Read more \n \n Her statement continued: \u201cWhere do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campuses isn\u2019t always because people are rapists.\u201d The letter \u2013 a selection of which the judge read in court, saying it was a useful reference that highlighted Turner\u2019s strong character \u2013 went viral this week, sparking national outrage from people who said it perpetuated rape culture and cast blame on victims. \n \n In the wake of significant backlash, Northside Festival, a New York music showcase, announced Tuesday that it had dropped Rasmussen\u2019s band from its lineup, and her group, Good English, has now released an apology from Rasmussen. \n \n The 20-year-old\u2019s letter of support for Turner was one of dozens submitted to the judge, Aaron Persky, who is facing a recall campaign for giving the defendant a light sentence. Although a jury determined, based on witness testimony, that Turner had sexually assaulted an unconscious woman outside a fraternity party on campus, Persky ordered a sentence of six months in county jail, instead of the minimum two years in prison prescribed by law. \n \n In a statement Good English shared with the Guardian, Rasmussen said she wanted the judge to \u201cconsider the effect that alcohol played in this tragedy\u201d, adding: \n \n I understand that this appeal has now provided an opportunity for people to misconstrue my ideas into a distortion that suggests I sympathize with sex offenses and those who commit them or that I blame the victim involved. Nothing could be farther from the truth, and I apologize for anything my statement has done to suggest that I don\u2019t feel enormous sympathy for the victim and her suffering \u2026 There is nothing more sad than the unnecessary, destructive and enormous toll that overuse, misuse and abuse of alcohol and drugs play in people\u2019s lives, and I don\u2019t think my effort to point this out in confidence to a judge while commenting on Brock Turner\u2019s character, as the sober person I knew him to be, was an irresponsible or reckless decision. Unfortunately, due to the overzealous nature of social media and the lack of confidence and privacy in which my letter to the judge was held, I am now thrust into the public eye to defend my position on this matter in the court of public opinion. \n \n Unlike her original letter, Rasmussen acknowledged the \u201cenormous pain\u201d of the victim and said Turner was \u201ctried and rightfully convicted of sexual assault\u201d. \n \n The band \u2013 which posted the apology on Facebook and subsequently deleted the page \u2013 declined to comment further. \n \n \n \n After publication of this article, Rasmussen posted a second apology on her personal Facebook page, saying it was wrong for her to make assumptions about what happened that night. \n \n \u201cMost importantly, I did not acknowledge strongly enough the severity of Brock\u2019s crime and the suffering and pain that his victim endured, and for that lack of acknowledgement, I am deeply sorry. \n \n I fully understand the outrage over Brock\u2019s sentencing and my statement. I can only say that I am committed to learning from this mistake. I am 20 years old, and it has never been more clear to me that I still have much to learn.\u201d \n \n Rasmussen\u2019s letter was part of the court record of character references Persky considered before sentencing, and activists and supporters of the victim said they were appalled that the judge, who is a former Stanford athlete, placed so much weight on the references and the impact the trial has had on Turner. \n \n Michele Dauber, a Stanford law professor and family friend of the victim, said it was important that these letters be exposed considering that the judge used them to justify leniency. \n \n \u201cShe says in the letter that rapists don\u2019t cause rape. That\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d said Dauber, who posted an excerpt of Rasmussen\u2019s letter on Twitter and is leading the recall campaign against the judge. \u201cI\u2019m shocked that the judge found that to be persuasive.\u201d \n \n Michele Dauber (@mldauber) #brockturner court probation report is fetid pond of victim-blaming rapeyness @thehuntinground @hodgman @brielarson pic.twitter.com/hygboyoV9q \n \n Citing Rasmussen\u2019s references to \u201cbeing politically correct\u201d, Dauber added, \u201cIf that\u2019s what this judge thinks is a good argument, then I think we need to get that out in front of the voters.\u201d \n \n Dauber noted that the character witnesses participated in a \u201cpublic process\u201d, adding, \u201cThey wanted to help their friend, and it was very effective. He was not sentenced to prison.\u201d \n \n Turner\u2019s own testimony blaming the assault on \u201cparty culture\u201d and his father\u2019s statement that his son is paying a steep price for \u201c20 minutes of action\u201d have also attracted widespread criticisms. \n \n The judge has declined to comment while an appeal in the case is pending. \n \n The case originally received international attention when the 23-year-old victim released a powerful statement about rape culture and the suffering she has endured throughout the process. \n \n \u2022 Two quotes in this article were amended on 8 June at the request of Michele Dauber. ||||| Former Stanford swimmer Brock Turner, who was convicted of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman on campus, exhibited concerning behavior before with other women, according to sentencing documents. \n \n At a party the night the victim was sexually assaulted, a woman said Turner suddenly grabbed her and kissed her, the court documents show. The woman then turned and pushed him away, describing the interaction as \"odd\" because they had not talked much and there was no flirtation. \n \n Later that night, Turner came back and tried to kiss her a second time as she was talking to a friend. He put his hands on her waist, and she \"had to move away from him,\" the sentencing document said. \n \n On June, 25 2015, detectives received information about two women who encountered Turner the weekend before the sexual assault took place. The woman attended a KA fraternity party on the weekend of Jan. 9, 2015, where one of the women was introduced to Turner. \n \n The woman said Turner started dancing with her and described him as being \u201cflirtatious\u201d with her, according to sentencing court documents. After she began to feel uncomfortable and \u201cturn her body away so that he would not be directly \u2018behind\u2019 her,\u201d he became \u201ctouchy\u201d and put his hands on her waist, stomach and upper thighs. \n \n UIG via Getty Images \n \n The woman said Turner \"creeped\" her out because of his persistence, the court document stated. \n \n It is unclear why it took the women so long to report the incident to the police. \n \n Turner was previously arrested in 2014, when a police officer saw him and a group of friends walking and drinking beers on campus. When the officer yelled, \"Stop! Police!\" the group ran away from him and continued running after he yelled it again. \n \n One of the men who was detained identified Turner as one of his swim teammates whom he was drinking with when the detective first saw him. The detective then called Turner and asked him to return to the scene, and when he did, he was wearing a \"bright orange tuxedo\" and smelled of alcohol, the document said. He had a backpack with beers inside, as well as a beer in his hand, and admitted to trying to hide the beer because he was under age. \n \n The prosecutors' sentencing document says it was \"abundantly\" clear that on the night of the sexual assault, Turner was \"on the prowl\" and attempted to \"hook up\" with women who were strangers to him. The sexual assault came one week after he was similarly aggressive with another female, at a different fraternity party, at the same location, the document said. \n \n The document stated that Turner is still in denial about his criminal culpability and that he violated the victim's body and her right to choose with whom she engages in sexual activity, the document states. In his statement to probation he seems to regret his choice, not because it caused a woman to be sexually assaulted, but because it has greatly affected his life as though he is the \"victim\" of \"peer pressure,\" the document states. \n \n In the early morning hours of Jan. 18, after Brock was arrested, police observed a text message sent to Turner in the \u201cGroup Me\u201d application that said \u201cWho\u2019s t*** are those?\u201d Police obtained a search warrant for Turner\u2019s phone but were unable to locate that text or any photos relating to that text, according to the documents. \n \n The search of Turner\u2019s phone \u201cshed some light\u201d into his behavior and character during the time period relating to the sexual assault and in the year prior to when he began attendance at Stanford, according to the sentencing document. \n \n Prosecutors said there was evidence indicating Turner engaged in \u201cexcessive drinking and using drugs,\u201d including a photo of him smoking from a pipe, a close-up photo of a bong, another photo of one of Turner\u2019s swim teammates with a bong in his hand and a December 2014 video showing turner smoking from a bong and drinking out of a bottle of liquor. \n \n Several text messages indicative of drug use during Turner\u2019s time at Stanford and when he was still in high school in Ohio were also found on his phone, according to the sentencing document, and the texts contained several references to smoking, buying and sharing \u201cweed\u201d from as early as April 2014, as well as references to doing acid or trying to find a \u201chook up.\u201d \n \n The document also stated that Turner lied about ever using illicit drugs in his statement to probation and appeared to make it seem as though his first time drinking was at a swim party when he first got to Stanford. Prosecutors also said he also lied about that there was some sort of \u201cflirtation\u201d between the woman he kissed abruptly at the frat party. \n \n The judge who oversaw Turner\u2019s case has been receiving abusive and threatening phone calls after his six-month sentence caused a media frenzy, said Santa Clara Public Defender Gary Goodman. ||||| \u201cHow does the average person who is really upset and troubled about the Brock story, how does somebody participate in that, making right of a wrong?\u201d Mr. Stedman said. \u201cWe are really just one tiny, infinitesimal part of that puzzle, but I think it was a no-brainer for us.\u201d \n \n In her letter, Ms. Rasmussen, 20, says that there was a distinction between rape and Mr. Turner\u2019s case, and suggested that alcohol was to blame for his actions. \n \n Mr. Turner, 20, a swimmer at Stanford, was found by two passers-by, partially clothed behind a trash bin on campus, on top of the 23-year-old woman, who was incapacitated by alcohol, according to the authorities. The passers-by stopped the assault and held Mr. Turner down as he tried to flee. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to base the fate of the next ten + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn\u2019t remember anything but the amount she drank to press charges against him,\u201d Ms. Rasmussen, who plays drums in the band, wrote. \u201cBut where do we draw the line and stop worrying about being politically correct every second of the day and see that rape on campus isn\u2019t always because people are rapists.\u201d \n \n Mr. Turner was convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault for the attack, which took place in January 2015. This week the judge in the case, Aaron Persky of Superior Court in Santa Clara County, Calif., came under withering criticism from the public for the sentence he imposed: six months in jail and probation. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

View all New York Times newsletters. \n \n Ms. Rasmussen\u2019s letter was part of a package of letters sent to the judge on behalf of Mr. Turner before his sentencing, a standard practice in which people seek to influence a sentencing decision by sharing their experiences of the defendant. His father also sent a letter that had an even more explosive effect when it was made public this week; he said that the episode had affected his son\u2019s appetite and that, in particular, he no longer enjoyed rib-eye steaks. \n \n Following the firestorm her letter provoked, Ms. Rasmussen said that her words were being twisted and that she was being unfairly stigmatized. \u201cThis appeal has now provided an opportunity for people to misconstrue my ideas into a distortion that suggests I sympathize with sex offenses and those who commit them or that I blame the victim involved,\u201d she said in a statement. \n \n Ms. Rasmussen also believed that the letter to the judge was private. But a spokesman for the court said she was wrong \u2014 such letters, like most documents entered into the court, are a matter of public record. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Within hours of Ms. Rasmussen\u2019s letter being made public by New York magazine, Good English was removed from a roster of Brooklyn venues where they were scheduled to perform in the coming days, including Rock Shop in Gowanus, Industry City Distillery in Greenwood, Gold Sounds in Bushwick, and Bar Matchless in Greenpoint. \n \n \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be affiliated with anyone that\u2019s going to try to victim-blame or even just downplay rape,\u201d said Larry Hyland, an owner of Bar Matchless. \n \n Mr. Hyland said he had received over 50 emails and posts on the bar\u2019s Facebook page demanding that the band\u2019s show be canceled. Some of the messages, he said, included threats to confront the band members if they did perform. \n \n \u201cWe didn\u2019t cancel the show because of censorship,\u201d he said, adding that while he disagreed with the content of Ms. Rasmussen\u2019s letter, he understood the impulse to want to help a childhood friend. \u201cI wanted to avoid an unsafe environment.\u201d \n \n On Tuesday, the Dayton Music Art and Film Festival near the band\u2019s hometown announced that it, too, was removing the band from its September lineup. \u201cSuch actions should not be defended, friend or not,\u201d the festival wrote on its Facebook page. On Wednesday, Behind the Curtains Media, the public relations firm that represented Good English, dropped them from its client roster. \n \n In her statement, Ms. Rasmussen attributed the fallout from her initial letter not to what she wrote, but to \u201cthe overzealous nature of social media.\u201d In particular, she lamented the \u201cuproar of judgment and hatred unleashed on me\u201d and the effect it was having on her musical aspirations. ||||| Photo: Courtesy of the Santa Clara County Sheriff \n \n While Brock Turner, the ex-Stanford student who sexually assaulted an unconscious woman behind a dumpster last year, has formally been sentenced on three counts of felony sexual assault, he is not being described as a convicted rapist in the media. Many people have been asking why. Here\u2019s your answer. Warning: It\u2019s pretty unsatisfying. \n \n In California, rape is defined as someone using \u201cphysical force, intimidation, duress, or threats to persuade the victim to engage in sexual intercourse.\u201d In the case of Turner\u2019s rape of an unconscious woman, witnesses and testimony determined that Turner penetrated his victim with a foreign object, not a sexual organ. His victim, who read powerful testimony in court directly addressing Turner, explained what she learned after the attack: \n \n Never mentioned me voicing consent, never mentioned us even speaking, a back rub. One more time, in public news, I learned that my ass and vagina were completely exposed outside, my breasts had been groped, fingers had been jabbed inside me along with pine needles and debris, my bare skin and head had been rubbing against the ground behind a dumpster, while an erect freshman was humping my half naked, unconscious body. But I don\u2019t remember, so how do I prove I didn\u2019t like it. \n \n In the eyes of the law, what Turner did to his victim is considered sexual assault and not rape, no matter how horrific it sounds. The three charges Turner was convicted of are \u201cassault with intent to commit rape of an intoxicated woman, sexually penetrating an intoxicated person with a foreign object, and sexually penetrating an unconscious person with a foreign object.\u201d \n \n Intent to commit rape, legally, is not the same as sexually penetrating a person, and therefore, Turner is not being described as a convicted rapist. But he is now a registered sex offender for the rest of his life.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 More aftermath following the conviction of Stanford swimmer Brock Turner on sexual assault charges, including new allegations of previous troubling behavior he showed toward women\u2014with prosecutors noting he was \"on the prowl\" the night of the attack and was still in denial as of his sentencing that his actions were criminal, ABC News reports. Per sentencing documents, a woman at a party the same night Turner attacked his victim alleges he became sexually aggressive toward her, grabbing her and kissing her, without encouragement. And in June 2015, investigators got wind about two other women who ran into Turner at a frat party the weekend before the January assault. One said he was \"flirtatious\" while dancing, and that when she began to feel \"creeped out\" and tried to turn away, he became \"touchy.\" Meanwhile, a Turner supporter facing backlash for calling out the victim's drinking issued a \"defensive apology\" to the Guardian Wednesday. In her statement, Leslie Rasmussen says people \"misconstrued\" her defense of Turner into meaning she didn't feel for the victim, a \"distortion\" she blames on the \"overzealous nature of social media\" and, per the New York Times, the fact that she mistakenly thought her court letter would be kept private. \"I apologize for anything my statement has done to suggest that I don't feel enormous sympathy for the victim and her suffering,\" she said. The Guardian notes that after its own article was posted with her apology, she wrote a follow-up on Facebook. \"I was not there that night. I had no right to make any assumptions about the situation,\" she wrote Wednesday evening. \"Most importantly, I did not acknowledge strongly enough the severity of Brock's crime and the suffering and pain that his victim endured, and for that lack of acknowledgement, I am deeply sorry.\" She adds that, at the age of 20, \"it has never been more clear to me that I still have much to learn.\" (New York explains why Turner isn't \"technically\" a convicted rapist.)",

His childhood friend, Leslie Rasmussen, wrote the letter, which the judge read in court, saying it was a useful reference that highlighted Turner's strong character. Rasmussen also said it was unfair \"to base the fate of the next 10 + years of his life on the decision of a girl who doesn\u2019t remember anything.\" She said Turner was trying to \"hook up\" with women who were strangers to him on the night of the assault, which happened one week after he was similarly aggressive with another female, the New York Daily News reports.

    "document": "GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) \u2014 Archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool at an ancient rock shelter in the high desert of eastern Oregon that could turn out to be older than any known site of human occupation in western North America. \n \n The find was announced Thursday by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which controls the land on which the site was found. \n \n University of Oregon archaeologist Patrick O'Grady, who supervises the dig, says the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside Riley has not been fully excavated. But the tool, a hand-held scraper chipped from a piece of orange agate not normally found in eastern Oregon, was found about 8 inches below a layer of volcanic ash from an eruption of Mount St. Helens that has been dated to 15,800 years ago. The depth was about 12 feet below the surface. \n \n Bureau of Land Management archaeologist Scott Thomas said that if the age of the site holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest west of the Rockies, and another predating the so-called Clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America. The earliest Clovis artifacts, known for distinctive and elegant stone points, are dated to about 13,000 years ago. \n \n O'Grady called the find \"tantalizing,\" but he added that they want to continue digging this summer to see whether the volcanic ash covers the entire area. \n \n Donald K. Grayson, professor of archaeology at the University of Washington, said the scientific community would be skeptical. \n \n \"No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way,\" he said. \"Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.\" \n \n Two pre-Clovis sites are well documented and generally accepted by scientists, Grayson said. One is Paisley Cave, located about 60 miles southwest of the Rimrock site. The other is Monte Verde in Chile. Both are dated about 1,000 years before the oldest Clovis sites. \n \n If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses and bison roamed the area. \n \n The find has yet to be submitted to a scientific journal for publication, but it has been reported in newsletters and at conferences, Thomas said. \n \n Thomas found the site several years ago, while taking a break from carrying supplies to a session of the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School nearby that O'Grady was overseeing. \n \n Thomas said he noticed an outcropping of an ancient lava flow, with some very tall sage brush growing in front of it, indicating very deep sediment deposits. The soil was black in front of the rock, indicating someone regularly built cooking fires there for a long time. An ancient streambed ran by, which would have given people more reason to stay there. And on the surface, he found a stone point of the stemmed type, found at sites both older and younger than Clovis. Similar points have been found at Paisley Cave \n \n Volunteers looking around the surface found some 30 stemmed points, and the field school started excavations in 2011, O'Grady said. Uncovered above and below the volcanic ash layer were fragments of teeth believed to be from ancient camels. \n \n Tests by Archaeological Investigations Northwest Inc. of Portland on blood residue on the agate scraper were consistent with the bovid family of animals, Thomas said. The most likely bovine animal living in Oregon at that time would have been an ancestor of the buffalo. ||||| PORTLAND, Ore. - \n \n Near the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter outside of Riley in southeast Oregon, archaeologists recently discovered evidence suggesting one of the oldest known human occupations in the western United States, officials said Thursday. \n \n Archaeologists with the Bureau of Land Management and the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School have been excavating at the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter since 2011. \n \n Their discoveries have included a number of stone projectile points and tooth enamel fragments likely belonging to a prehistoric camel (Camelops sp.) that became extinct approximately 13,000 years ago. \n \n But what has the archaeological community most excited is a small stone tool found below a layer of volcanic ash. \n \n Near the bottom of a 12-foot deposit, archaeologists discovered a layer of ash that was identified as volcanic ash from a Mt. St. Helens eruption about 15,800 years ago. \n \n Beneath the layer of volcanic ash, archaeologists discovered a small orange agate tool believed to have been used for scraping animal hides, butchering, and possibly carving wood. \n \n A blood residue analysis of the tool revealed animal proteins consistent with bison, the most likely species being Bison antiquus, an extinct ancestor of the modern buffalo. \n \n \u201cThe discovery of this tool below a layer of undisturbed ash that dates to 15,800 years old means that this tool is likely more than 15,800 years old, which would suggest the oldest human occupation west of the Rockies,\u201d said Scott Thomas, BLM Burns District archaeologist. \n \n Presently, Oregon\u2019s Paisley Cave, also managed by the BLM, is considered home to the earliest known residents of North America based on human physical evidence. \n \n In 2008, a team of archaeologists, led by Dr. Dennis Jenkins with the University of Oregon's Museum of Natural and Cultural History, discovered coprolites - dried feces - containing human DNA dated over 14,000 years old. \n \n Dr. Patrick O\u2019Grady, with the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, has been directing the Rimrock Draw Rockshelter excavations since they began. \n \n \u201cWhen we had the volcanic ash identified, we were stunned, because that would make this stone tool one of the oldest artifacts in North America. Given those circumstances and the laws of stratigraphy, this object should be older than the ash,\u201d said O\u2019Grady. \n \n \"While we need more evidence before we can make an irrefutable claim, we plan to expand our excavation this summer and hopefully provide further evidence of artifacts found consistently underneath that layer of volcanic ash. That\u2019s the next step,\u201d he added, \n \n The University of Oregon Archaeological Field School, in partnership with the BLM and volunteers from the Oregon Archaeological Society, will begin its fifth season this summer, offering students, researchers and volunteers invaluable field experience. \n \n Stan McDonald, BLM Oregon/Washington lead archaeologist, explained the potential this discovery has for the archaeological community. \n \n \u201cFor years, many in the archaeological field assumed that the first humans in the western hemisphere were the Clovis people \u2013 dating to around 13,000 years ago,\" McDonald said. \"While a handful of archaeological sites older than Clovis cultures have been discovered in the past few decades, there is still considerable scrutiny of any finding that appears older.\u201d \n \n \u201cWith the recent findings at Rimrock Draw Shelter, we want to assemble indisputable evidence, because these claims will be scrutinized by researchers,\" he said. \"That said, the early discoveries are tantalizing.\u201d \n \n Flickr photo album: https://www.flickr.com/photos/blmoregon/sets/72157651118216896/",

    "document": "These weren\u2019t natural formations, and they weren\u2019t the work of bears. They were built by people. \n \n Recognizing the site\u2019s value, the caver brought in archaeologist Francois Rouzaud. Using carbon-dating, Rouzaud estimated that a burnt bear bone found within the chamber was 47,600 years old, which meant that the stalagmite rings were older than any known cave painting. It also meant that they couldn\u2019t have been the work of Homo sapiens. Their builders must have been the only early humans in the south of France at the time: Neanderthals. \n \n The discovery suggested that Neanderthals were more sophisticated than anyone had given them credit for. They wielded fire, ventured deep underground, and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions. Perhaps they even carried out rituals; after all, there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave, so what else were the rings and mounds for? \n \n Rouzaud would never know. In April 1999, while guiding colleagues through a different cave, he suffered a fatal heart attack. With his death, work on the Bruniquel Cave ceased, and its incredible contents were neglected. They\u2019ve only now re-entered the limelight because Sophie Verheyden went on holiday. \n \n A life-long caver, Verheyden works at the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, where she specializes in stalagmites. She treats them as time capsules, using the chemicals within them to reconstruct the climate of past millennia. So when she learned about Bruniquel Cave, while visiting the region on holiday and seeing a display at a nearby castle, she had only one thought: Why hadn\u2019t anyone dated the broken stalagmites themselves?\u201d \n \n She knew that Rouzaud\u2019s date of 47,600 years was impressive but suspect. Carbon-dating is only accurate for samples younger than 50,000 years, so the Bruniquel material was hitting the technique\u2019s limits. They could well have been much older. To get a better estimate, Verheyden assembled a team including archaeologist Jacques Jaubert and fellow stalagmite expert Dominique Genty. In 2013, they got permission to study the site and crawled into it themselves. \u201cI\u2019m not very big, and I had to put one arm before me and one behind to get through,\u201d says Verheyden. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of magical, even without the structures.\u201d \n \n After drilling into the stalagmites and pulling out cylinders of rock, the team could see an obvious transition between two layers. On one side were old minerals that were part of the original stalagmites; on the other were newer layers that had been laid down after the fragments were broken off by the cave\u2019s former users. By measuring uranium levels on either side of the divide, the team could accurately tell when each stalagmite had been snapped off for construction. \n \n Their date? 176,500 years ago, give or take a few millennia. \n \n \u201cWhen I announced the age to Jacques, he asked me to repeat it because it was so incredible,\u201d says Verheyden. Outside Bruniquel Cave, the earliest, unambiguous human constructions are just 20,000 years old. Most of these are ruins\u2014collapsed collections of mammoth bones and deer antlers. By comparison, the Bruniquel stalagmite rings are well-preserved and far more ancient. ||||| BERLIN (AP) \u2014 Two mysterious stone rings found deep inside a French cave were probably built by Neanderthals about 176,500 years ago, proving that the ancient cousins of humans were capable of more complex behavior than previously thought, scientists say. \n \n The structures were made from hundreds of pillar-shaped mineral deposits, called stalagmites, which were chopped to a similar length and laid out in two oval patterns up to 40 centimeters (16 inches) inches high. They were discovered by chance in 1990, after remaining untouched for tens of thousands of years because a rockslide had closed the mouth of the cave at Bruniquel in southwest France. \n \n While previous research had suggested the structures pre-dated the arrival of modern humans in Europe around 45,000 years ago, the notion that Neanderthals could have made them didn't fit long-held assumptions that these early humans were incapable of the kind of complex behavior necessary to work underground. \n \n Using sophisticated dating techniques, a team led by archaeologist Jacques Jaubert of the University of Bordeaux, France, found that the stalagmites must have been broken off the ground around 176,500 years ago \"making these edifices among the oldest known well-dated constructions made by humans.\" \n \n \"Their presence at 336 meters (368 yards) from the entrance of the cave indicates that humans from this period had already mastered the underground environment, which can be considered a major step in human modernity,\" the researchers concluded in a study published online Wednesday by the journal Nature. \n \n Jaubert ruled out that the carefully constructed rings, which show traces of fire, could have come about by chance or been assembled by animals such as the bears and wolves whose bones were found near the entrance of the cave. \n \n \"The origin of the structures is undeniably human. It really cannot be otherwise,\" he told The Associated Press. \n \n The Neanderthals who built them must have had a \"project\" to go so deep into a cave where there was no natural light, said Jaubert.

That began to change in the late '80s, the Atlantic reports, when a boy named Bruno Kowalsczewski started clearing away what obstructed the opening; three years later, in 1990, the then-15-year-old's 100-foot path allowed local cavers entry. One caver made it more than 1,000 feet in and found something wild: two stone rings up to 16 inches high intentionally made from pieces of chopped-up stalagmites (pillar-shaped mineral deposits that stick up from the ground), probably by Neanderthals some 176,500 years ago, scientists now say. A press release notes \"until now the oldest formally proven cave use dated back only 38,000 years.\" While previous research had suggested the structures predated the arrival of modern humans in Europe around 45,000 years ago, the AP reports the notion that Neanderthals could have made them didn't fit long-held assumptions that these early humans were incapable of the kind of complex behavior necessary to work underground. \"Their presence at [1,102 feet] from the entrance of the cave indicates that humans from this period had already mastered the underground environment, which can be considered a major step in human modernity,\" the researchers concluded in a study published online Wednesday by the journal Nature.

They must have been built by Neanderthals. They wielded fire, ventured deep underground, and shaped the subterranean rock into complex constructions. Perhaps they even carried out rituals; after all, there was no evidence that anyone actually lived in the cave, so what else were they for? They could well have been much older.",

A World War II veteran, he bought a variety store in a small rural town in 1950 and 41 years later owned the largest retail chain in America. \n \n But a collection of photographs taken between 1950 and 1994 that captures the story of a family living the American dream has become the subject of an ugly lawsuit. \n \n The photos were taken by Robert Huff, who owned Bob\u2019s Studio of Photography in Fayetteville, Ark., about 35 minutes down the road from where the Walton family lived. Huff\u2019s son David joined the family business and over the years they shot hundreds of photos of the Waltons. \n \n Now the Waltons are suing the photographer\u2019s widow, Helen Huff, 63, to get the photo negatives, along with any proofs and prints she still has. \n \n The Walton family and the Walmart Museum (filing suit as Crystal Lands, LLC, and Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., respectively) claim the negatives and proofs belong to them and that the studio only kept them as a courtesy to the family, according to the complaint filed in an Arkansas court. They want to prevent Huff from selling the negatives or using them for commercial purposes. \n \n Huff claims she has copyright to the photos and filed a counterclaim asking a federal judge to stop Wal-Mart from using them without her permission. Wal-Mart wants to display some of the photos at its museum. \n \n The 200 photos in question include pictures of the Walton family, the original Wal-Mart board of directors and the Wal-Mart visitor\u2019s center. Some of the photos were shot at Bob\u2019s Studio of Photography, others the family took to the studio for restoration. \n \n The case boils down to who was in charge when these photographs were taken. Huff says her husband and father-in-law were hired as independent contractors, according to the Arkansas Times, which would mean they were in charge of the photoshoots and have rights to the photos they took. As proof, Huff points out that the photographers used their own equipment, lenses, lights and backdrops; controlled the positions of their subjects; chose and developed the film or hired the processing company; and provided a copyright notice to the Walton family notifying them that they owned \u2018exclusive rights to reproduce\u2019 the pictures.\u201d \n \n But the Waltons claim, according to the newspaper, that the photographs were created as a \u201cwork-for-hire.\u201d Without a written contract, the Waltons have to show their relationship with the photography studio was like an employer-employee relationship in which the family was boss. As proof, the family claims it supervised the photo shoots. \n \n The Professional Photographers of America (PPA) believes Huff is the rightful owner of the pictures. \u201c[I]n this case, it\u2019s the largest retailer in the world bullying a small Arkansas studio,\u201d wrote chief executive David Trust on PPA\u2019s Web site. \u201cIt\u2019s a total David vs. Goliath situation.\u201d \n \n PPA cites a case in which Oprah Winfrey claimed she owned rights to photos taken on her TV set. As in the Wal-Mart case, Winfrey wanted rights to the photos and claimed they were created as works-for-hire. But without written agreements, the court found in favor of the photographers. \n \n PPA reported that the Waltons offered Helen Huff $2,000 for the negatives and proofs, which she turned down. But Huff\u2019s lawyers declined to confirm the offer. \n \n On Monday, Wal-Mart spokesman Randy Hargrove issued a statement about the case: \n \n As you can imagine, many of the photos go back many years and commemorate the history, heritage and culture of our company. We believe that some of the photos that Bob\u2019s Studio has belong to Walmart. All we want is for the court to make it clear who rightfully owns these photographs. We tried very hard to resolve this without involving the courts. We never wanted the issue to reach this point and we\u2019ve done everything possible to avoid this. \n \n A federal judge in the U.S. District Court in the Western District of Arkansas will hear the case on July 7. \n \n Related Content: ||||| click to enlarge Drawing from PPA Today \n \n As you can imagine, many of the photos go back many years and commemorate the history, heritage and culture of our company.

Huff and his son, David A. Huff, owners ofin Fayetteville and both now deceased, photographed members of the Walton family from 1950 to 1994 in their studio. The Walton family, suing as Crystal Lands LLC, maintains that the studio kept the negatives and proofs as a courtesy to the family, but that they are the intellectual property of the Waltons.Defendantwidow of David Huff, has filed a counterclaim, saying she holds the copyright to the photos and asking the court to stop Walmart from using the photographs without her permission. Huff says Bob and David Huff were independent contractors, using their own equipment, lenses, lights and backdrops; controlled the positions of their subjects; chose and developed the film or hired the processing company; and provided a copyright notice to the Walton family notifying them that they owned \u201cexclusive rights to reproduce\u201d the pictures.Wal-Mart Stores, filing as, and Crystal Lands filed suit March 28 in Benton County Circuit Court, but attorneys for Huff, citing federal copyright law, were able to remove the case to federal court in the Western District of Arkansas. Federal Judgehas scheduled a case management hearing for July 7.The Waltons claim the pictures were taken under their \u201csupervision\u201d and that they thus hold intellectual property rights to more than 200 photographs in six boxes, including those shot at the studio as well as photos taken to the studio for restoration. The plaintiffs are asking the court for a declaratory judgment that the Walmart Museum and the family own the photographs and, whatever the result of the case is, to prevent Huff from making commercial use of the pictures.PPA Today, the website of the Professional Photographers Association, reported on the lawsuit on its website May 12. The PPA claims that the Waltons offered Helen Huff $2,000 for the photographs, but Huff\u2019s attorneys,andof the Everett, Wales and Comstock firm in Fayetteville, declined to confirm the offer. PPA Today noted in its article the Natkin v. Winfrey case, in which Oprah Winfrey claimed to own photographs taken on her set, but lost when the court ruled the photographers were not under \u201cwork-for-hire\u201d contracts. Martin and Everett also maintain that Bob\u2019s Studio\u2019s arrangement with the Waltons was also not a \u201cwork-for-hire\u201d contract. David Trust, CEO of the PPA, made the \u201cDavid vs. Goliath\u201d comparison, and said the suit \u201cwould set a terrible precedent and goes, flat out, against copyright law.\u201dWalmart spokesman Randy Hargrove issued this statement this afternoon: ||||| We've (finally) got an update on the Walmart v. Huff case! Brush up on the story below first if you need a refresher. \n \n Update 7/16: \n \n At a recent case management hearing, the judge set the trial for the trial term beginning April 6, 2015 and ending April 30. This doesn't necessarily mean the case will go to trial April 6, just that the case is set to be tried sometime during that term. \n \n Read the full story: \n \n Your typical copyright infringement involves one photographer stealing another photographer's images, or reproducing copyrighted images without permission. But in this case, it's the largest retailer in the world bullying a small Arkansas studio. \n \n Walmart and its founding family, the Waltons, have filed suit against Helen Huff, the widow of Arkansas photographer David A. Huff. \n \n David Huff's studio, Bob's Studio of Photography, was founded by his late father, Robert A. Huff, in 1946, and created portraits of the Walton family before the expansion of Walmart grew them into one of the wealthiest families in the world. But now Walmart and the Walton family are demanding that Helen Huff hand over those works. \n \n The complaint states that they (the Waltons) seek to obtain six or more boxes of photos, negatives, and proofs, alleging that over the years, Bob's Studio retained those items \"as a courtesy\" to Walmart and their family (they didn't). The complaint further states that the Waltons own intellectual property rights to the photos (they don't). The fact is, under federal law, photographers own the copyrights to their own works. \n \n PPA has been working with Huff to support her case and thereby advocate for photographers' copyrights. \n \n \"If there were ever a David vs. Goliath situation, this is it\" says PPA CEO David Trust. \"We simply can't remain idle and allow this to happen--it would set a terrible precedent. In our opinion, this obviously is a violation of copyright law and it is beyond question that Ms. Huff owns the photographs and if the Waltons want the photographs, they should pay for them. PPA as an association stands behind Ms. Huff and supports her case as the rightful owner of these images. We have contacted her lawyers and offered to file an amicus brief* when and if that time comes.\" \n \n *What's an amicus brief, you ask? It's is a legal opinion or testimony that is volunteered by a \"friend of the court\" who is not a party to a particular lawsuit but has a strong interest in the case. It is a way to introduce concerns ensuring that the possibly broad legal effects of a court decision will not depend solely on the parties directly involved in the case. \n \n PPA also advised Huff and her attorney of a separate suit, Natkin v. Winfrey, in which Oprah Winfrey claimed she owned the rights to photos of her created on her set. Since the photographers were hired as independent contractors and had not signed work-for-hire contracts, they owned the full copyrights for the images, and Winfrey's argument was swiftly rejected by the court. \n \n Walmart filed its lawsuit against Helen Huff in state court, but because it is a copyright issue, Huff's defense removed it to federal court. The defense argues in its answer to the Walmart complaint that Huff owns copyrights to all the works her late husband and father-in-law created for the Walton family, and that they worked as independent contractors for the Walton family. In addition, Huff's defense filed a counterclaim of copyright infringement, alleging that in the past Walmart has reproduced and allowed third parties to use Bob's Studio of Photography's copyrighted works. Huff and her attorney are awaiting Walmart's answer. \n \n UPDATED 5/21: Walmart spokesman Randy Hargrove issued a statement this afternoon: \n \n \n \n As you can imagine, many of the photos go back many years and commemorate the history, heritage and culture of our company. We believe that some of the photos that Bob's Studio has belong to Walmart. All we want is for the court to make it clear who rightfully owns these photographs. We tried very hard to resolve this without involving the courts.

    "document": "\n \n Waves driven by a cyclone appear in the Elbe estuary near the North Sea close to northern Germany. (Christian Charisius/European Pressphoto Agency) \n \n A group of scientists says it has now reconstructed the history of the planet\u2019s sea levels arcing back over some 3,000 years \u2014 leading it to conclude that the rate of increase experienced in the 20th century was \u201cextremely likely\u201d to have been faster than during nearly the entire period. \n \n \u201cWe can say with 95 percent probability that the 20th-century rise was faster than any of the previous 27 centuries,\u201d said Bob Kopp, a climate scientist at Rutgers University who led the research with nine colleagues from several U.S. and global universities. Kopp said it\u2019s not that seas rose faster before that \u2013 they probably didn\u2019t \u2013 but merely that the ability to say as much with the same level of confidence declines. \n \n The study was published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n Seas rose about 14 centimeters (5.5 inches) from 1900 to 2000, the new study suggests, for a rate of 1.4 millimeters per year. The current rate, according to NASA, is 3.4 millimeters per year, suggesting that sea level rise is still accelerating. \n \n Oceanographer Josh Willis from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory explains how sea levels have changed over the last two decades. (NASA) \n \n Unsurprisingly, the study blames the anomalous 20th-century rise on global warming \u2014 and not just that. It also calculates that, had humans not been warming the planet, there\u2019s very little chance that seas would have risen so much during the century, finding that instead of a 14 centimeter rise, we would have seen somewhere between a 3 centimeter fall and a 7 centimeter rise. \n \n [Why the U.S. East Coast could be a major \u2018hotspot\u2019 for rising seas] \n \n The new work is particularly significant because, in effect, the sea level analysis produces a so-called \u201chockey stick\u201d graph \u2014 showing a long and relatively flat sea level \u201chandle\u201d for thousands of years, followed by a \u201cblade\u201d that turns sharply upwards in very recent times. \n \n The discovery of such patterns itself has a long history, going back to a 1998 study by climate researcher Michael Mann of Penn State University and two colleagues \u2014 who found a \u201chockey stick\u201d graph for the planet\u2019s temperature, rather than for its sea level. Since then the \u201chockey stick,\u201d in its various incarnations, has come in for voluminous criticism from skeptics and doubters of human-caused climate change \u2014 even as multiple scientists have continued to affirm the conclusion that the last 100 years or so are way out of whack with what the planet has seen in the past thousand or more. \n \n [Why the planet\u2019s ancient past holds a worrying lesson about Antarctica] \n \n The new research also forecasts that no matter how much carbon dioxide we emit, 21st-century sea level rise will still greatly outstrip what was seen in the 1900s. Nonetheless, choices made today could have a big impact. For a low emissions scenario, it finds that seas might only rise between 24 and 61 centimeters. In contrast, for a high emissions scenario \u2014 one that the recent Paris climate accord pledged the world to avert \u2014 they could rise as much as 52 to 131 centimeters, or, at the very high end, 4.29 feet. \n \n However, Kopp notes that the methods used to project these totals may not fully capture what happens over the course of this century. \u201cWe have a model that\u2019s calibrated against a period when a certain set of processes, largely thermal expansion and glaciers, were dominant,\u201d he says, \u201cand we\u2019re looking forward to a period when other factors will be dominant.\u201d \n \n As Kopp\u2019s words acknowledge, the major contributors to sea level rise in the 20th century were the melting of mountain glaciers around the globe and the natural expansion of ocean water as it warms. However, in the 21st century, researchers think that the truly major players in potential sea level rise, the huge ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, will come to play a larger role. (Just how large remains unclear.) \n \n The current study was based on combining a variety of so-called \u201creconstructions\u201d of past rates of sea level from 24 locations around the world with more recent measurements from 66 global tide gauges. That\u2019s necessary because you can\u2019t just measure sea level change in a single place and get a global picture \u2014 over long time periods, factors ranging from whether land is rising or sinking to changes in ocean currents and the gravitational pull of the planet\u2019s ice sheets mean that different regions can see different amounts of sea level rise (or fall). \n \n One of the sites where past sea levels were reconstructed by scientists is pictured below: \n \n \n \n Coastal wetland in Newfoundland, Canada, that harbors a record of sea level for the past 2,000 years. (Courtesy of Ben Horton) \n \n The new study follows in the footsteps of a 2011 study that looked at the ocean and climate records contained in salt marshes in North Carolina to infer the history of sea level rise over the past 2,100 years \u2014 research that had many of the same authors. That study, too, found that the recent sea level rise is unprecedented over that time period. \n \n Mann of Penn State, one originator of the \u201chockey stick\u201d reference and a co-author on the 2011 study (but not the current one), said by email that he thinks the current work is an \u201cincremental advance\u201d on that prior study, albeit one he agreed with in broad outline \n \n Mann continued by email: \n \n The study nonetheless reiterates the conclusion we reached [in 2011] that the acceleration in sea level rise over the past century is unprecedented over at least the past millennium, and that this acceleration is directly related to the spike in surface temperature over the past century (i.e. the \u201chockey stick\u201d). \n \n The new paper emerges even as another study, also published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, produced very similar 21st-century projections of sea level rise. That paper, led by Matthias Mengel of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, also calculated that with unconstrained emissions, the Earth could see a maximum of some four feet of sea level rise by 2100. But it too acknowledged that the approach \u201ccannot cover processes\u201d like the possible collapse of the oceanfront glaciers of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which, it said, \u201cis hypothesized to be already underway.\u201d \n \n Such calculations are roughly in line with the 2013 projections of the U.N.\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for expected sea level rise by 2100, although they rely on a different, more simple type of model than that body used. However, Princeton climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer, who was not involved in the current work but collaborates with Kopp and was his postdoctoral adviser, says that this agreement between approaches still \u201cbegs the question of just how much disintegration of the polar ice sheets will contribute to sea level during the 21st century since neither type of model is adequate for capturing this growing and potentially disastrous contribution \u2013 and that is ultimately the most important unknown, both with regard to sea level and potentially with respect to the whole field of climate change.\u201d \n \n Capping a major day for sea level rise news, Kopp also released a report Monday along with Benjamin Strauss of Climate Central and two other researchers, using the current study\u2019s approach to determine that thousands of coastal \u201cnuisance\u201d floods in the United States over the 20th century would not have happened without human-caused global warming. \n \n Based on just four inches of sea level rise attributed to humans in the 20th century, and another two inches so far in the 21st, Strauss said he \u201cwas really surprised to see that there are human fingerprints on thousands of coastal floods that we\u2019ve already had in the United States.\u201d The reason is that such nuisance floods \u2014 King Tide flooding in Miami would be a good example \u2014 represent what Strauss calls a \u201cthreshold\u201d phenomenon, which is caused after sea level rise reaches a certain level. \n \n \u201cI think these studies really put the human fingerprint on Miami Beach\u2019s hundred-million-dollar saltwater flooding problem, and really a lot of what\u2019s going on in South Florida,\u201d Strauss said. \n \n More at Energy & Environment: \n \n The solution to climate change that has nothing to do with cars or coal \n \n We may have just seen a truly ominous new weather record \n \n It\u2019s not just Flint: Poor communities across the U.S. live with \u2018extreme\u2019 polluters \n \n For more, you can sign up for our weekly newsletter here, and follow us on Twitter here. ||||| Abstract \n \n We present new sea-level reconstructions for the past 2100 y based on salt-marsh sedimentary sequences from the US Atlantic coast. The data from North Carolina reveal four phases of persistent sea-level change after correction for glacial isostatic adjustment. Sea level was stable from at least BC 100 until AD 950. Sea level then increased for 400 y at a rate of 0.6 mm/y, followed by a further period of stable, or slightly falling, sea level that persisted until the late 19th century. Since then, sea level has risen at an average rate of 2.1 mm/y, representing the steepest century-scale increase of the past two millennia. This rate was initiated between AD 1865 and 1892. Using an extended semiempirical modeling approach, we show that these sea-level changes are consistent with global temperature for at least the past millennium. ||||| Skip Ad x Embed x Share Sea level rise is one of the most visible ramifications of global warming and new research published on Monday now shows the startling present-day impacts of global warming-related sea level rise. \n \n Yana Kibyakova walks through a flooded street that was caused by the combination of the lunar orbit, which caused seasonal high tides, and what many believe is the rising sea levels due to climate change on Sept. 29, 2015 in Miami Beach, Fla.

The link to global warming has been both intuitive and evident. Temperatures rise, and satellites watch glaciers and ice sheets shrink; networks of robotic buoys sample ocean waters as they heat and expand. \n \n We have also known that coastal floods are increasing. The link to sea level rise is clear. A higher starting level means that the same tide, the same storm surge, goes higher than it otherwise would have. Tide gauges dotting our bays and beaches have been recording this shift. \n \n So far as I know, until now, no study has extended the links all the way from burning fossil fuels, to global warming, to sea level rise, to coastal floods that were caused unambiguously by us. But that is what collaborators and I have attempted to do in a new analysis. \n \n Sea level change has a dizzying array of causes, not just global warming. In some places, land is sinking. In others, it is rising. People have pumped enough freshwater out of deep aquifers to swell the ocean, but also captured enough water behind dams to shrink it. Currents shift. Even gravity shifts, as ice sheets lose mass and tug the oceans toward them just a little bit less. \n \n The result is a complex mosaic with different rates of sea level rise in different places. Since 1950, for example, we\u2019ve seen parts of Chesapeake Bay rise by a foot, half that in Boston, and half that again in Honolulu. Amidst all this noise, new research led by Robert Kopp of Rutgers University, has extracted an essential signal: the amount of global sea level rise that has come from us. \n \n For the 20th century, Kopp and his colleagues\u2019 central estimate is global sea level has risen about four-and-a-half inches. Extended through 2014 for our follow-on report, the estimate increases to six inches. These don\u2019t sound like world-changing numbers, especially considering that many sea level projections for the this century run beyond three feet. But if you live in Annapolis or Charleston, Atlantic City or Port Isabel, our analysis shows that those inches have already changed your world. \n \n In our report, we took a simple approach. We subtracted yearly estimates for human-caused global sea level rise based on Kopp\u2019s paper, from hourly water level records at 27 tide gauges around the United States. Then we compared how many days the water level exceeded the local threshold for nuisance flooding \u2014 with or without our subtractions. \n \n Nuisance flooding is flooding that closes coastal area roads, overwhelms storm drains, and compromises infrastructure. It doesn\u2019t wreck your home, but it could make it hard to get to work, or even to flush the toilet. The National Weather Service defines local nuisance flood thresholds based on decades of observing local impacts. \n \n From 1950 through 2014, out of the 8,726 actual nuisance flood days that our analysis identified, 5,809 of them \u2014 two-thirds \u2014 would not have taken place if you remove Kopp et al.\u2019s central estimate of human-caused global sea level rise. Even using a low estimate \u2014 one more than 95 percent likely to be too low \u2014 more than 3,500 of the flood days would not have taken place. \n \n These totals represent just 27 tide gauges within the U.S.: 27 gauges that happen to have high quality hourly water level records since 1950. The true impact of human-caused sea level rise is much broader. And it has been sharply accelerating. Our central assessment indicates that within the past decade, human-caused rise tips the balance for 75 percent of floods study-wide, and for more than 90 percent of floods at sites ranging from Florida to San Diego, Seattle to Honolulu. \n \n When a street floods with saltwater, and you can\u2019t drive home, or you have to sandbag your store, human instinct looks for the nearby cause: it was a very high tide, or a strong wind blew from the wrong direction. But what if the tide or the wind were not enough to tip the balance? What if the waters would not have crossed the last lip, the critical threshold, without a few inches of boost? \n \n Now we have looked into the pool of water gathered on the asphalt and found an uncomfortable answer reflecting back: the flood is us. \n \n You May Also Like: \n \n These Paintings Turn Climate Data Into Art \n \n Weakening Ice Shelves Raise Sea Level Rise Concerns \n \n Wildfires Are Burning Some of the World\u2019s Oldest Trees \n \n What Scalia\u2019s Death Means For Climate Change ||||| Significance We present the first, to our knowledge, estimate of global sea-level (GSL) change over the last \u223c3,000 years that is based upon statistical synthesis of a global database of regional sea-level reconstructions. GSL varied by \u223c\u00b18 cm over the pre-Industrial Common Era, with a notable decline over 1000\u20131400 CE coinciding with \u223c0.2 \u00b0C of global cooling. The 20th century rise was extremely likely faster than during any of the 27 previous centuries. Semiempirical modeling indicates that, without global warming, GSL in the 20th century very likely would have risen by between \u22123 cm and +7 cm, rather than the \u223c14 cm observed. Semiempirical 21st century projections largely reconcile differences between Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projections and semiempirical models. \n \n Abstract We assess the relationship between temperature and global sea-level (GSL) variability over the Common Era through a statistical metaanalysis of proxy relative sea-level reconstructions and tide-gauge data. GSL rose at 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y (2\u03c3) over 0\u2013700 CE. A GSL fall of 0.2 \u00b1 0.2 mm/y over 1000\u20131400 CE is associated with \u223c0.2 \u00b0C global mean cooling. A significant GSL acceleration began in the 19th century and yielded a 20th century rise that is extremely likely (probability P \u2265 0.95 ) faster than during any of the previous 27 centuries. A semiempirical model calibrated against the GSL reconstruction indicates that, in the absence of anthropogenic climate change, it is extremely likely ( P = 0.95 ) that 20th century GSL would have risen by less than 51% of the observed 13.8 \u00b1 1.5 cm. The new semiempirical model largely reconciles previous differences between semiempirical 21st century GSL projections and the process model-based projections summarized in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report. \n \n Estimates of global mean temperature variability over the Common Era are based on global, statistical metaanalyses of temperature proxies (e.g., refs. 1\u21d3\u20133). In contrast, reconstructions of global sea-level (GSL) variability have relied upon model hindcasts (e.g., ref. 4), regional relative sea-level (RSL) reconstructions adjusted for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) (e.g., refs. 5\u21d3\u21d3\u20138), or iterative tuning of global GIA models (e.g., ref. 9). Based primarily on one regional reconstruction (8), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u2019s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (10) concluded with medium confidence that GSL fluctuations over the last 5 millennia were < \u00b1 25 cm. However, AR5 was unable to determine whether specific fluctuations seen in some regional records (e.g., ref. 5) were global in extent. Similarly, based upon a tuned global GIA model, ref. 9 found no evidence of GSL oscillations exceeding \u223c 15 \u201320 cm between \u22122250 and 1800 CE and no evidence of GSL trends associated with climatic fluctuations. \n \n The increasing availability and geographical coverage of continuous, high-resolution Common Era RSL reconstructions provides a new opportunity to formally estimate GSL change over the last \u223c3,000 years. To do so, we compiled a global database of RSL reconstructions from 24 localities (Dataset S1, a and Fig. S1A), many with decimeter-scale vertical resolution and subcentennial temporal resolution. We augment these geological records with 66 tide-gauge records, the oldest of which (11) begins in 1700 CE (Dataset S1, b and Fig. S1B), as well as a recent tide-gauge\u2013based estimate of global mean sea-level change since 1880 CE (12). \n \n Fig. S1. Locations of sites with (A) proxy data and (B) tide-gauge data included in the analysis. \n \n To analyze this database, we construct a spatiotemporal empirical hierarchical model (13, 14) that distinguishes between sea-level changes that are common across the database and those that are confined to smaller regions. The RSL field f ( x , t ) is represented as the sum of three components, each with a Gaussian process (GP) prior (15), f ( x , t ) = g ( t ) + l ( x ) ( t \u2212 t 0 ) + m ( x , t ) . [1]Here, x represents spatial location, t represents time, and t 0 is a reference time point (2000 CE). The three components are (i) GSL g ( t ) , which is common across all sites and primarily represents contributions from thermal expansion and changing land ice volume; (ii) a regionally varying, temporally linear field l ( x ) ( t \u2212 t 0 ) , which represents slowly changing processes such as GIA, tectonics, and natural sediment compaction; and (iii) a regionally varying, temporally nonlinear field m ( x , t ) , which primarily represents factors such as ocean/atmosphere dynamics (16) and static equilibrium \u201cfingerprint\u201d effects of land\u2212ice mass balance changes (17, 18). The regional nonlinear field also incorporates small changes in rates of GIA, tectonics, and compaction that occur over the Common Era. The incorporation of the regionally correlated terms l ( x ) ( t \u2212 t 0 ) and m ( x , t ) ensures that records from regions with a high density of observations are not unduly weighted in estimating the common GSL signal g ( t ) . \n \n Because a constant-rate trend in g ( t ) could also be interpreted as a regional linear trend that is present at all reconstruction sites but is not truly global, we condition the model on the assumption that mean GSL over \u2212100\u2013100 CE is equal to mean GSL over 1600\u20131800 CE and focus on submillennial variations (Fig. 1A). We chose the first window to encompass the beginning of the Common Era and the last window to cover the last 2 centuries before the development of a tide-gauge network outside of northern Europe. \n \n Fig. 1. (A) Global sea level (GSL) under prior ML 2,1 . Note that the model is insensitive to small linear trends in GSL over the Common Era, so the relative heights of the 300\u20131000 CE and 20th century peaks are not comparable.

We consider five priors with different hyperparameters (see Supporting Information). The presented rates are taken from prior ML 2,1 , which is optimized under the assumption that the a priori timescales of variability in global and regional sea-level change are the same. Results from the four alternative priors are presented in Supporting Information. Quoted probabilities are conservatively taken as minima across all five priors. Illustrative fits at specific sites are shown in Fig. S2. \n \n Fig. S2.

Errors are \u00b1 2 \u03c3 . \n \n Results and Discussion Common Era Reconstruction. Pre-20th-century Common Era GSL variability was very likely (probability P = 0.90 ) between \u223c \u00b1 7 cm and \u00b1 11 cm in amplitude (Fig. 1A and Dataset S1, e). GSL rose from 0 CE to 700 CE ( P \u2265 0.98 ) at a rate of 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y (2\u03c3), was nearly stable from 700 CE to 1000 CE, then fell from 1000 CE and 1400 CE ( P \u2265 0.98 ) at a rate of 0.2 \u00b1 0.2 mm/y (Fig. 1A). GSL likely rose from 1400 CE to 1600 CE ( P \u2265 0.75 ) at 0.3 \u00b1 0.4 mm/y and fell from 1600 CE to 1800 CE ( P \u2265 0.86 ) at 0.3 \u00b1 0.3 mm/y. Historic GSL rise began in the 19th century, and it is very likely ( P \u2265 0.93 ) that GSL has risen over every 40-y interval since 1860 CE. The average rate of GSL rise was 0.4 \u00b1 0.5 mm/y from 1860 CE to 1900 CE and 1.4 \u00b1 0.2 mm/y over the 20th century. It is extremely likely ( P \u2265 0.95 ) that 20th century GSL rise was faster than during any preceding century since at least \u2212800 CE. The spatial coverage of the combined proxy and long-term tide-gauge dataset is incomplete. The available data are sufficient to reduce the posterior variance in the mean 0\u20131700 CE rate by > 10 % relative to the prior variance along coastlines in much of the North Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, and parts of the Mediterranean, the South Atlantic, the South Pacific, and Australasia (Fig. 2A). High-resolution proxy records are notably lacking from Asia, most of South America, and most of Africa. Nevertheless, despite the incomplete coverage and regional variability, sensitivity analyses of different data subsets indicate that key features of the GSL curve\u2014a rise over 0\u2013700 CE, a fall over 1000\u20131400 CE, and a rise beginning in the late 19th century\u2014are not dependent on records from any one region (Dataset S1, f). By contrast, the rise over 1400\u20131600 CE and fall over 1600\u20131800 CE are not robust to the removal of data from the western North Atlantic. Fig. 2. (A) Mean estimated rate of change (millimeters per year) over 0\u20131700 CE under prior ML 2,1 . In shaded areas, conditioning on the observations reduces the variance by at least 10% relative to the prior. (B\u2212F) Mean estimated rates of change (mm/y) from (B) 0\u2013700 CE, (C) 700\u20131400 CE, (D) 1400\u20131800 CE, (E) 1800\u20131900 CE, and (F) 1900\u20132000 CE, after removing the 0\u20131700 CE trend. Areas where a rise and a fall are about equally likely ( P = 0.33\u20130.67) are crosshatched. The color scales are centered around the noted rate of GSL change. On millennial and longer timescales, regional RSL change can differ significantly from GSL change as a result of GIA, tectonics, and sediment compaction (Fig. 2). For example, over 0\u20131700 CE, RSL rose at 1.5 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y in New Jersey, on the collapsing forebulge of the former Laurentide Ice Sheet, and fell at 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y on Christmas Island, in the far field of all late Pleistocene ice cover (Dataset S1, g). Detrended RSL (after removal of the average 0\u20131700 CE rate) reveals notable patterns of temporal variability, especially in the western North Atlantic, where the highest-resolution reconstructions exist. Rates of RSL change in New Jersey and North Carolina vary from the long-term mean in opposite directions over 0\u2013700 CE and 1000\u20131400 CE (Fig. 2 and Dataset S1, g). Over 0\u2013700 CE, a period over which GSL rose at 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y, detrended RSL rose in New Jersey ( P \u2265 0.91 ) while it fell in North Carolina ( P \u2265 0.88 ). Conversely, over 1000\u20131400 CE, while GSL was falling, detrended RSL fell in New Jersey ( P > 0.90 ) while it rose in North Carolina ( P \u2265 0.99 ). This pattern is consistent with changes in the Gulf Stream (16) or in mean nearshore wind stress (19). If driven by the Gulf Stream, it suggests a weakening or polar migration of the Gulf Stream over 0\u2013700 CE, with a strengthening or equatorial migration occurring over 1000\u20131400 CE. Our estimate differs markedly from previous reconstructions of Common Era GSL variability (5, 6, 9, 20) (Fig. S3F). For example, the ref. 20 hindcast predicts GSL swings with \u223c4\u00d7 larger amplitude, and it includes a rise from 650 CE to 1200 CE (a period of GSL stability and fall in the data-based estimate) and a fall from 1400 CE to 1700 CE (a period of approximate GSL stability in the data-based estimate). The curve derived from the detrended North Carolina RSL reconstruction (5) indicates an amplitude of change closer to our GSL reconstruction but differs in phasing from it, with a relatively high sea level during \u223c 1200 \u20131500 CE likely reflecting the regional processes mentioned above. The globally tuned GIA model of ref. 9, which includes 31 data points from the last millennium (compared with 790 proxy data points in our analysis), found no systematic GSL changes over the Common Era. Fig. S3. (A\u2013E) GSL estimates under priors (A) ML 2,1 , (B) ML 2,2 , (C) ML 1,1 , (D) Gr, and (E) NC. (F) GSL reconstruction under prior ML 2,1 (black) compared with the hindcast of ref. 20 (G09 hindcast; red), a curve derived from the North Carolina RSL curve by detrending and the addition of \u00b1 10 mm ( 2 \u03c3 ) errors after ref. 5 (NC pseudo-GSL; green), and the 19th\u201320th century GMSL reconstructions of ref. 12 (Hay2015; magenta) and ref. 106 (CW2011; yellow). Multicentury records are aligned relative to the 1600\u20131800 CE average; 19th\u201320th century reconstructions are aligned to match our GSL reconstruction in 2000 CE. Errors are \u00b1 1 \u03c3 . Twentieth Century GSL Rise. Semiempirical models of GSL change, based upon statistical relationships between GSL and global mean temperature or radiative forcing, provide an alternative to process models for estimating future GSL rise (e.g., refs. 20\u21d3\u21d3\u201323) and generating hypotheses about past changes (e.g., refs. 4, 20, and 24). The underlying physical assumption is that GSL is expected to rise in response to climatic warming and reach higher levels during extended warm periods, and conversely during cooling and extended cool periods. Ref. 5 generated the first semiempirical GSL model calibrated to Common Era proxy data, but relied upon sea-level data from a single region rather than a global synthesis. Our new GSL curve shows that multicentury GSL variability over the Common Era shares broad commonalities with global mean temperature variability, consistent with the assumed link that underlies semiempirical models. For example, the 9 \u00b1 8 cm GSL fall over 1000\u20131400 CE coincides with a \u223c0.2 \u00b0C decrease in global mean temperature, and the 9 \u00b1 3 cm GSL rise over 1860\u20131960 CE coincides with \u223c0.2 \u00b0C warming (2). Motivated by these commonalities, using our GSL reconstruction and two global mean temperature reconstructions (1, 2), we construct a semiempirical GSL model that is able to reproduce the main features of GSL evolution (Fig. 1 B and C). To assess the anthropogenic contribution to GSL rise, we consider two hypothetical global mean temperature scenarios without anthropogenic warming. In scenario 1, the gradual temperature decline from 500 CE to 1800 CE is taken as representative of Earth\u2019s long-term, late Holocene cooling (2), and, in 1900 CE, temperature returns to a linear trend fit to 500\u20131800 CE. In scenario 2, we assume that 20th century temperature stabilizes at its 500\u20131800 CE mean. The difference between GSL change predicted under these counterfactuals and that predicted under observed temperatures represents two alternative interpretations of the anthropogenic contribution to GSL rise (Table 1, Fig. 1A, and Fig. S4). Both scenarios show a dominant human influence on 20th century GSL rise. Table 1. Hindcasts of 20th century GSL rise (centimeters) Fig. S4. Counterfactual hindcasts of global mean sea-level rise in the absence of anthropogenic warming. Each row assumes a different counterfactual temperature scenario (see Materials and Methods), and each column represents model calibration to a different temperature reconstruction (Inset). In the temperature Insets, the black lines represent the original temperature reconstruction to 1900, the blue line represents the counterfactual scenario, and the red line represents the HadCRUT3 temperature reconstruction for the 20th century. In the main plots, the blue and red curves correspond, respectively, to the HadCRUT3 and counterfactual temperature scenarios. The difference between them can be interpreted as the anthropogenic GSL rise. Heavy shading, 67% credible interval; light shading, 90% credible interval. The hindcast 20th century GSL rise, driven by observed temperatures, is \u223c13 cm, with a 90% credible interval of 7.7\u201317.5 cm. This is consistent with the observed GSL rise of 13.8 \u00b1 1.5 cm, which is due primarily to contributions from thermal expansion and glacier mass loss (25). Of the hindcast 20th century GSL rise, it is very likely ( P = 0.90 ) that \u221227% to +41% of the total (scenario 1) or \u221210% to +51% of the total (scenario 2) would have occurred in the absence of anthropogenic warming. Under all calibrations and scenarios, it is likely ( P \u2265 0.88 ) that observed 20th century GSL rise exceeded the nonanthropogenic counterfactuals by 1940 CE and extremely likely ( P \u2265 0.95 ) that it had done so by 1950 CE (Dataset S1, h). The GSL rise in the alternative scenarios is related to the observation that global mean temperature in the early 19th century was below the 500\u20131800 CE trend (and thus below the 20th century in scenario 1) and, for most of the 19th century, was below the 500\u20131800 CE mean (and thus below the 20th century in scenario 2) (Fig. S4). The estimates of the nonanthropogenic contribution to 20th century GSL rise are similar to ref. 4\u2019s semiempirical estimate of 1\u20137 cm. They are also comparable to the detrended fluctuation analysis estimates of refs. 26 and 27, which found it extremely likely that < \u223c40% of observed GSL rise could be explained by natural variability. These previous estimates, however, could have been biased low by the short length of the record used. The 3,000-y record underlying our estimates provides greater confidence. Projected 21st Century GSL Rise. The semiempirical model can be combined with temperature projections for different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) to project future GSL change (Table 2, Fig. 1D, and Dataset S1, i). RCPs 8.5, 4.5, and 2.6 correspond to high-end \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d greenhouse gas emissions, moderate emissions abatement, and extremely strong emissions abatement, respectively. They give rise to very likely ( P = 0.90 ) GSL rise projections for 2100 CE (relative to 2000 CE) of 52\u2013131 cm, 33\u201385 cm, and 24\u201361 cm, respectively. Comparison of the RCPs indicates that a reduction in 21st century sea-level rise of \u223c30 to 70 cm could be achieved by strong mitigation efforts (RCP 2.6), even though sea level is a particularly \u201cslow-responding\u201d component of the climate system. Table 2. Projections of 21st century GSL rise (centimeters) Since ref. 21 inaugurated the recent generation of semiempirical models with its critique of the process model-based GSL projections of the IPCC\u2019s Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) (28), semiempirical projections have generally exceeded those based upon process models. While AR5\u2019s projections (29) were significantly higher than those of AR4, semiempirical projections (e.g., ref. 23) have continued to be higher than those favored by the IPCC. However, our new semiempirical projections are lower than past results, and they overlap considerably with those of AR5 (29) and of ref. 30, which used a bottom-up probabilistic estimate of the different factors contributing to sea-level change. They also agree reasonably well with the expert survey of ref. 31 (Table 2). Our analysis thus reconciles the remaining differences between semiempirical and process-based models of 21st century sea-level rise and strengthens confidence in both sets of projections. However, both semiempirical and process model-based projections may underestimate GSL rise if new processes not active in the calibration period and not well represented in process models [e.g., marine ice sheet instability in Antarctica (32)] become major factors in the 21st century. \n \n Conclusions We present, to our knowledge, the first Common Era GSL reconstruction that is based upon the statistical integration of a global database of RSL reconstructions. Estimated GSL variability over the pre-20th century Common Era was very likely between \u223c \u00b1 7 cm and \u223c \u00b1 11 cm, which is more tightly bound than the < \u00b1 25 cm assessed by AR5 (10) and smaller than the variability estimated by a previous semiempirical hindcast (4). The most robust pre-Industrial signals are a GSL increase of 0.1 \u00b1 0.1 mm/y from 0 CE to 700 CE and a GSL fall of 0.2 \u00b1 0.2 mm/y from 1000 CE to 1400 CE. The latter decline coincides with a decline in global mean temperature of \u223c0.2 \u00b0C, motivating the construction of a semiempirical model that relates the rate of GSL change to global mean temperature. Counterfactual hindcasts with this model indicate that it is extremely likely ( P = 0.95 ) that less than about half of the observed 20th century GSL rise would have occurred in the absence of global warming, and that it is very likely ( P = 0.90 ) that, without global warming, 20th century GSL rise would have been between \u22123 cm and +7 cm, rather than the observed 14 cm. Forward projections indicate a very likely 21st century GSL rise of 52\u2013131 cm under RCP 8.5 and 24\u201361 cm under RCP 2.6, values that provide greater consistency with process model-based projections preferred by AR5 than previous semiempirical projections. \n \n Materials and Methods Sea-Level Records. The database of RSL reconstructions (Dataset S2) was compiled from published literature, either directly from the original publications or by contacting the corresponding author (5, 7, 8, 33\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u201389). The database is not a complete compilation of all sea-level index points from the last \u223c3,000 years. Instead, we include only those reconstructions that we qualitatively assessed as having sufficient vertical and temporal resolution and density of data points to allow identification of nonlinear variations, should they exist. This assessment was primarily based on the number of independent age estimates in each record. Where necessary and possible, we also included lower-resolution reconstructions to ensure that long-term linear trends were accurately captured if the detailed reconstruction was of limited duration. For example, the detailed reconstruction from the Isle of Wight (69) spans only the last 300 y, and we therefore included a nearby record that described regional RSL trends in southwest England over the last 2,000 y (51). Each database entry includes reconstructed RSL, RSL error, age, and age error. For regional reconstructions produced from multiple sites (e.g., ref. 5), we treated each site independently. Where we used publications that previously compiled RSL reconstructions (e.g., refs. 37 and 45), the results were used as presented in the compilation. RSL error was assumed to be a 2 \u03c3 range unless the original publication explicitly stated otherwise or if the reconstruction was generated using a transfer function and a Random Mean SE Standard Error of Prediction was reported, in which case this was treated as a 1 \u03c3 range. We did not reinterpret or reanalyze the published data, except for the South American data (33, 59, 71, 90) that were mostly derived from marine mollusks (vermetids). The radiocarbon ages for these data were recalibrated using a more recent marine reservoir correction (91) and the IntCal13 and MARINE13 radiocarbon age calibration curves (92). Tide gauge records were drawn from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) (93, 94). We included all records that were either (i) longer than 150 y, (ii) within 5 degrees distance of a proxy site and longer than 70 y, or (iii) the nearest tide gauge to a proxy site that is longer than 20 y (Dataset S1, b). We complement these with multicentury records from Amsterdam (1700\u20131925 CE) (11), Kronstadt (1773\u20131993 CE) (95), and Stockholm (1774\u20132000 CE) (96), as compiled by PSMSL. Annual tide-gauge data were smoothed by fitting a temporal GP model to each record and then transforming the fitted model to decadal averages, both for computational efficiency and because the decadal averages more accurately reflect the recording capabilities of proxy records. To incorporate information from a broader set of tide-gauge records, we also included decadal averages from the Kalman smoother-estimated GSL for 1880\u20132010 CE of ref. 12. Off-diagonal elements of the GSL covariance matrix were derived from an exponential decay function with a 3-y decorrelation timescale. This timescale was set based on the mean temporal correlation coefficient across all tide gauges using the annual PSMSL data, which approaches zero after 2 y. Spatiotemporal Statistical Analysis. Hierarchical models (for a review targeted at paleoclimatologists, see ref. 14) divide into different levels. The hierarchical model we use separates into (i) a data level, which models how the spatiotemporal sea-level field is recorded, with vertical and temporal noise, by different proxies; (ii) a process level, which models the latent spatiotemporal field of RSL described by Eq. 1; and (iii) a hyperparameter level. We used an empirical Bayesian analysis method, meaning that, for computational efficiency, the hyperparameters used are point estimates calibrated in a manner informed by the data (and described in greater detail in Supporting Information); thus, our framework is called an empirical hierarchical model. The output of the hierarchical model includes a posterior probability distribution of the latent spatiotemporal field f ( x , t ) , conditional on the point estimate hyperparameters. (Dataset S3 provides the full time series and covariance of the posterior estimate of GSL.) Our use of GP priors at the process level and normal likelihoods at the data level renders the calculation of this conditional posterior analytically tractable (15). At the data level, the observations y i are modeled as y i = f ( x i , t i ) + w ( x i , t i ) + y 0 ( x i ) + \u03f5 i y [2] t i = t ^ i + \u03f5 i t [3] w ( x , t ) \u2248 G P { 0 , \u03c3 w 2 \u03b4 ( x , x \u2032 ) \u03b4 ( t , t \u2032 ) } [4] y 0 ( x ) \u2248 G P { 0 , \u03c3 0 2 \u03b4 ( x , x \u2032 ) } [5] where x i is the spatial location of observation i, t i is its age, w ( x , t ) is a white noise process that captures sea-level variability at a subdecadal level (which we treat here as noise), t ^ i is the mean observed age, \u03f5 i t and \u03f5 i y are errors in the age and sea-level observations, y 0 ( x ) is a site-specific datum offset, and \u03b4 is the Kronecker delta function. The notation G P { \u03bc , k ( x , x \u2032 ) ) } denotes a GP with mean \u03bc and covariance function k ( x , x \u2032 ) . For tide gauges, \u03f5 t is zero and the distribution of \u03f5 y is estimated during the GP smoothing process, in which annual tide-gauge averages are assumed to have uncorrelated, normally distributed noise with SD 3 mm. For proxy data, \u03f5 t and \u03f5 y are treated as independent and normally distributed, with an standard deviation (SD) specified for each data point based on the original publication. Geochronological uncertainties are incorporated using the noisy input GP method of ref. 97, which uses a first-order Taylor series approximation of the latent process to translate errors in the independent variable into errors in the dependent variable, f ( x i , t i ) \u2248 f ( x i , t ^ i ) + \u03f5 i t \u2202 f ( x i , t ^ i ) \u2202 t . [6] The assumption that mean GSL over \u2212100\u2013100 CE is equal to mean GSL over 1600\u20131800 CE is implemented by conditioning on a set of pseudodata with very broad uncertainties (SD of 100 m on each individual pseudodata point) and a correlation structure that requires equality in the mean levels over the two time windows. At the process level, the GP priors for g ( t ) , l ( x ) and m ( x , t ) are given by g ( t ) \u2248 G P { 0 , \u03c3 g 0 2 + \u03c3 g 2 \u03c1 ( t , t \u2032 ; \u03c4 g ) } [7] l ( x ) \u2248 G P { ICE 5 G ( x ) , \u03c3 l 2 \u03b3 ( x , x \u2032 ; \u03bb l ) } [8] m ( x , t ) \u2248 G P { 0 , \u03c3 m 2 \u03b3 ( x , x \u2032 ; \u03bb m ) \u03c1 ( t , t \u2032 ; \u03c4 m ) } . [9] Here, ICE 5 G ( x ) denotes the GIA rate given by the ICE5G-VM2-90 model of ref. 98 for 1700\u20131950 CE. The temporal correlation function \u03c1 ( t , t \u2032 ; \u03c4 ) is a Mat\u00e9rn correlation function with smoothness parameter 3/2 and scale \u03c4. (The choice of smoothness parameter 3/2 implies a functional form in which the first temporal derivative is everywhere defined.) The spatial correlation \u03b3 ( x , x \u2032 ; \u03bb ) is an exponential correlation function parameterized in terms of the angular distance between x and x \u2032 . The hyperparameters of the model include the prior amplitudes \u03c3 g 0 , which is a global datum offset (for ML 2,1 , 118 mm); \u03c3 g , which is the prior amplitude of GSL variability (for ML 2,1 , 67 mm); \u03c3 l , which is the prior SD of slopes of the linear rate term (for ML 2,1 , 1.1 mm/y); and \u03c3 m , which is the prior amplitude of regional sea-level variability (for ML 2,1 , 81 mm). They also include the timescales of global and regional variability, \u03c4 g and \u03c4 m (for ML 2,1 , 136 y), the spatial scale of regional sea-level variability \u03bb m (for ML 2,1 , 7.7\u00b0), and the spatial scale of deviations of the linear term from the ICE5G-VM2-90 GIA model, \u03bb l (for ML 2,1 , 5.9\u00b0). In the ML 2,1 results presented in the main text, it is assumed that \u03c4 g = \u03c4 m ; four alternative sets of assumptions and calibrations of the hyperparameters are described in Supporting Information. Semiempirical Sea-Level Model. Our semiempirical sea-level model relates the rate of GSL rise d h / d t to global mean temperature T ( t ) , d h / d t = a ( T ( t ) \u2212 T 0 ( t ) ) + c ( t ) [10] with d T 0 ( t ) / d t = ( T ( t ) \u2212 T 0 ( t ) ) / \u03c4 1 d c ( t ) / d t = c / \u03c4 2 , where a is the sensitivity of the GSL rate to a deviation of T ( t ) from an equilibrium temperature T 0 ( t ) , \u03c4 1 is the timescale on which the actual temperature relaxes toward the equilibrium temperature, and c is a temperature-independent rate term with e-folding time \u03c4 2 . The first term describes the GSL response to climate change during the study period. The second term covers a small residual trend arising from the long-term response to earlier climate change (i.e., deglaciation), which is very slowly decaying over millennia and of the order 0.1 mm/y in 2000 CE. It thus has a negligible effect on the modeled GSL rise during the 20th and 21st centuries. By comparison with Eq. 2, ref. 5 used the formulation d h / d t = a 1 ( T ( t ) \u2212 T 0,0 ) + a 2 ( T ( t ) \u2212 T 0 ( t ) ) + b ( d T / d t ) . [11] The present model has two differences from that of ref. 5. First, we substitute the temperature-independent term c ( t ) for term a 1 ( T ( t ) \u2212 T 0,0 ) and thus eliminate the temperature dependence in this term. This modified term describes a very slow component of sea-level adjustment that can capture the tail end of the response to the last deglaciation. Second, we omit the fast response term b ( d T / d t ) because it is of no consequence on the long timescales considered here. We sample the posterior probability distribution of the parameter set \u03a8 = { c ( t ) , T 0 ( t ) , a , \u03c4 1 , \u03c4 2 } , specified as P ( \u03a8 | g ( t ) , T ( t ) ) , using a Metropolis\u2212Hastings (MH) algorithm (99) (Fig. S5A and Dataset S1, j). The starting parameter set is a maximum-likelihood set, determined by simulated annealing. Sampled Markov Chains are thinned to every 500th sample, with the first 1,000 samples discarded in a burn-in period. Fig. S5. (A) Probability distributions of semiempirical model parameters. Prior distributions (gray) are not shown in full where scaling axes to display them would render posteriors obscure. (B) Likelihood of different values of \u03c4 c o v . Black dots show likelihoods across all semiempirical projections, and the bars show the 5th/17th/83rd/95th percentile conditional likelihoods for individual semiempirical projections. A value of \u03c4 c o v = 100 y is used in the analysis. Orange [green] represents calibration with the Mann et al. (1) [Marcott et al. (2)] temperature curve. We use two alternative temperature reconstructions (Fig. 1B): (i) the global regularized expectation-maximization (RegEM) climate field reconstruction (CFR) temperature proxy of Mann et al. (1), incorporating the HadCRUT3 instrumental data of ref. 100 after 1850 CE, and (ii) the Marcott et al. (2) RegEM global reconstruction. We use 11-y averages from the Mann et al. reconstruction\u2019s annual values, whereas the Marcott et al. reconstruction reports 20-y average values. Because the number of proxy data in the Marcott et al. reconstruction decreases toward present, we combine it with 20-y averages from the HadCRUT3 data (100) and align them over their period of overlap (1850\u20131940 CE). The two temperature reconstructions are generally in good agreement, although the Marcott et al. record shows \u223c0.2 \u00b0C lower temperatures before \u223c 1100 CE. This overall agreement provides confidence that the true global temperature is represented within the uncertainties of the records, whereas the modest differences motivate the use of both records to provide a more realistic representation of uncertainty in the calculated GSL. We denote the temperature reconstruction as S ( t ) and treat it as noisy observations of T ( t ) ; i.e., S \u2248 N ( T , \u03a9 ) . To construct the temperature reconstruction covariance \u03a9 , we assume S is an AR(1) time series, with variance as specified in the reconstruction and a correlation e-folding time of 10 y. For each iteration i of our MH algorithm, we draw n = 100 samples T j from T | S . We assume that S and T have uninformative priors, so that P ( T | S ) = P ( S | T ) . We then calculate the corresponding sea-level time series h i , j = h ( \u03a8 i , T j ) , which we compare with the reconstructed GSL g to calculate the posterior probability distribution P ( \u03a8 i | g , S ) , P ( \u03a8 i | g , S ) \u2248 P ( g | \u03a8 i , S ) P ( \u03a8 i | S ) = P ( g | \u03a8 i , S ) P ( \u03a8 i ) \u2248 P ( g | \u03a8 i , T ) P ( T | S ) P ( \u03a8 i ) \u2248 1 n \u2211 j = 1 n P ( g | \u03a8 i , T j ) P ( \u03a8 i ) [12] P ( g | \u03a8 i , T j ) = | 2 \u03c0 \u03a3 | \u2212 1 / 2 \u00d7 exp ( \u2212 1 2 [ g ^ \u2212 h i , j ] \u22a4 \u03a3 \u2212 1 [ g ^ \u2212 h i , j ] ) [13] where g \u2248 N ( g ^ , \u03a3 ) is taken from the ML 2,1 reconstruction. To calculate the posterior distribution of the portion of GSL change explainable by the semiempirical model, we simply take the distribution of h i , j . The prior and posterior distributions of \u03a8 are shown in Dataset S1, j. To balance skill in modeling GSL with skill modeling the rate of change of GSL, we taper the original covariance matrix \u03a3 r estimated from the GP model. The resulting matrix \u03a3 = \u03a3 r \u2218 \u03bb is the entrywise product of the original matrix and an exponentially falling tapering function \u03bb i , j = exp ( \u2212 | t i \u2212 t j | / \u03c4 c o v ) . We select a value of \u03c4 c o v = 100 y, which is the maximum-likelihood estimate for the Mann et al. calibration based on a comparison of results for no tapering, a fully diagonal matrix, and values of \u03c4 c o v \u2208 { 10 , 50 , 100 , 200 , 500 , 1,000 } y (Fig. S5B). Counterfactual hindcasts of 20th century GSL were calculated by substituting T j \u2032 for T j in Eqs. 12 and 13, where each sample T j was transformed into T j \u2032 such that either (i) 20th century temperature followed a trend line fit to T j from 500 CE to 1800 CE, or (ii) 20th century temperature was equal to the 500\u20131800 CE average of T j . The historical baseline T j \u2033 was generated by replacing T j after 1900 CE with HadCRUT3, shifted so as to minimize the misfit between HadCRUT3 and T j over 1850\u20131900. The nonanthropogenic fraction is calculated as the distribution of h ( \u03a8 i , T j \u2033 ) \u2212 h ( \u03a8 i , T j \u2032 ) (Fig. S4). Projections of global mean temperature for the three RCPs were calculated using the simple climate model MAGICC6 (101) in probabilistic mode, similar to the approach of ref. 23. As described in ref. 102, the distribution of input parameters for MAGICC6 was constructed through a Bayesian analysis based upon historical observations (103, 104) and the equilibrium climate sensitivity probability distribution of AR5 (105). We combined every set of parameters \u03a8 i and historical temperatures T j with every single temperature realization of MAGICC6, so the uncertainties are a combination of parameter uncertainty, initial condition uncertainty, and projected temperature uncertainty. \n \n Sensitivity Tests for Reconstruction We consider five alternative empirical calibrations of the hyperparameters \u0398 = { \u03c3 g , \u03c3 l , \u03c3 m , \u03c3 w , \u03c3 0 , \u03c3 g 0 , \u03c4 g , \u03c4 m , \u03bb l , \u03bb m } (Dataset S1, c, and Fig. S3). (i) For prior ML 2,2 , \u0398 is empirically calibrated through a hybrid global simulated annealing/local sequential quadratic programming optimization to find the hyperparameters that maximize the likelihood of the model conditional upon the observations. (ii) Prior ML 2,1 is similar to prior ML 2,2 , but with the constraint that \u03c4 m = \u03c4 g , i.e., that there is one timescale hyperparameter for the nonlinear terms. (iii) Prior ML 1,1 is similar to prior ML 2,2 , but with the constraints that \u03c4 m = \u03c4 g and \u03c3 m = \u03c3 g , i.e., that there is one timescale hyperparameter and one amplitude hyperparameter for the nonlinear terms. (iv) For prior NC, \u03c3 g and \u03c4 g are optimized to maximize the likelihood of a GP model fit to the curve derived from the detrended North Carolina RSL reconstruction. The remaining hyperparameters are then empirically optimized to maximize the likelihood of the model conditional upon the observations. (v) For prior Gr, \u03c3 g and \u03c4 g are optimized to maximize the likelihood of a GP model fit to the ref. 20 GSL hindcast. The remaining hyperparameters are then empirically optimized to maximize the likelihood of the model conditional upon the observations. In all cases, the parameters were optimized conditional only upon observations with 2 \u03c3 age uncertainties of less than \u00b1 50 years. In order to ensure that the optimization process does not confuse the interpretations of the terms reflecting the processes of interest and the white-noise term, we optimized under the constraint that \u03c4 g and \u03c4 m > 100 y. To ensure that this is a reasonable constraint, we also tested a model in which the amplitude of the global term, \u03c3 g , was set equal to zero; thus, in this model, all observations were interpreted as reflecting regional changes. Without the inclusion of the global term, the optimal value of \u03c4 m is 123 y, consistent with the constraint. From an interpretive perspective, the main difference among the calibrated prior is the timescale of GSL variability \u03c4 g (Dataset S1, c). In priors ML 2,1 and ML 1,1 , this timescale is \u223c 100 y, whereas, for ML 2,2 , it is \u223c2,000 y, yielding an overly smooth GSL curve; other priors have intermediate timescales. Shorter timescales lead a greater proportion of centennial-scale variability to be attributed to GSL. Although ML 2,2 has the highest marginal likelihood, we focus on ML 2,1 in presenting results, as inspection of within-20th century rate estimates for ML 2,2 suggests oversmoothing. Prior estimates of rates and variability are shown in Dataset S1, d. We also consider the application of the model with the ML 2,1 before different subsets of data (Dataset S1, f). The decline in GSL between 1000 CE and 1400 CE is robust to the removal of North Atlantic data ( P = 0.91 in subset -NAtlantic+GSL) and to the consideration only of data from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean ( P = 1.00 in subset +AtlanticMediterranean+GSL). It is, however, not robust to the consideration only of data from South America ( P = 0.48 in subset +SAmerica+GSL) or only of data outside the Atlantic and Mediterranean ( P = 0.25 in subset -AtlanticMediterranean+GSL). To assess the impact of the exogenous ref. 12 GSL curve for the 20th century, we consider each subset of data with and without the inclusion of this curve (indicated in Dataset S1, f by +GSL and -GSL). Twentieth century rates have broader errors without the exogenous 20th century curve but are in general agreement with that curve (e.g., +All+GSL: 1.38 \u00b1 0.15 mm/y; +All-GSL: 1.31 \u00b1 0.33 mm/y). \n \n Acknowledgments We thank M.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's \"extremely likely\" that sea levels rose faster in the 20th century than at any other time in the previous 2,700 years \"and the rise over the last two decades has been even faster,\" scientists say. A new study\u2014based on \"reconstructions\" of past sea levels from 24 areas around the world, plus tide gauges\u2014finds global sea levels were steady for almost three millennia before they began to rise with the Industrial Revolution, reports USA Today. \"We can say with 95% probability that the 20th-century rise was faster than any of the previous 27 centuries,\" the lead author tells the Washington Post. Sea levels rose 5.5 inches from 1900 to 2000, or about 1.4 millimeters per year. NASA puts the current rate at 3.4 millimeters per year. Scientists expect sea levels to rise between 9.5 inches and 2 feet by 2100\u2014if we stick to the climate treaty agreed upon in Paris. But a high emissions scenario could see seas rise by more than 4 feet. Another study in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences seconds that finding but notes researchers didn't consider the collapse of glaciers of the West Antarctic ice sheet, which \"is hypothesized to be already underway.\" There's no surprise why: Humans burned fossil fuels, which produced greenhouse gases, which melted glaciers and warmed ocean waters, scientists say. If not for humans, sea levels might not have risen at all and thousands of coastal \"nuisance\" floods in the US would have been avoided, according to Climate Central. (Some 316 US cities may be partially submerged by 2100.)",

If he chooses to side with Barack Obama and with the Democrats in order to fund ObamaCare, then he owns ObamaCare and he can\u2019t get out of that.\u201cHe\u2019ll be as responsible for ObamaCare as Harry Reid,\u201d he said.Jenny Beth Martin, co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, said conservative groups around the country on Friday began focusing a national grassroots lobbying campaign on House Republicans.She said Tea Party Patriots directed 10,000 calls a day to Senate offices while the upper chamber debated a resolution linking the stopgap with a measure defunding ObamaCare.Martin said there would be growing calls from conservatives around the country for Boehner to resign if he allows the Senate-passed stopgap to receive a vote on the House floor.\u201cI think if he does that we\u2019ll probably see people across this country in the grassroots calling for a new Speaker,\u201d she said.The Senate stopgap bill does not include language defunding ObamaCare or prioritizing debt payments in the event that Congress fails to raise the debt limit. Both elements were in the original House bill.Threats from conservative activists are nothing new for Boehner. In March, Bozell blasted Boehner and other House GOP leaders for failing to deliver on the promises of the 2010 midterm election.Boehner\u2019s spokesman on Friday said the House would not approve a government funding bill that fails to address the Affordable Care Act.\u201cThe House will take action that reflects the fundamental fact that Americans don\u2019t want a government shutdown and they don\u2019t want the train wreck that is ObamaCare,\u201d said Brendan Buck.House Republicans will meet at around noon on Saturday in the Capitol to plot their legislative strategy.\u201cWe are reviewing our options and will discuss them with members tomorrow,\u201d said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Boehner.Rep. Tom Graves (R-Ga.) announced Friday afternoon that he would offer an amendment to the stopgap bill delaying ObamaCare until 2015. The proposal has 61 supporters.The mounting pressure from Tea Party groups and the tough rhetoric from House Republicans has alarmed senators who say a government shutdown appears more likely.Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said the situation is more unpredictable now than in 2011, when Congress teetered on the brink of a government shutdown and then a possible national default.\u201cReading the tea leaves is more difficult. I think it is going to be difficult on the [funding bill] and it may be even more difficult on the debt ceiling,\u201d Corker said. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be tough for them.\u201dEven if congressional leaders avoid a shutdown, they will face another showdown in mid-October over the debt limit. The administration says the nation\u2019s borrowing authority must be increased by Oct. 17.President Obama on Friday said negotiating with Republicans on the government funding bill would only give them incentive to use the debt-ceiling and any future expiration of government funding as bargaining chips.\u201cThe bill that's designed to avert a government shutdown basically just funds the government for another couple months, so we could be doing this all over again,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm sure the American people are thrilled about that. And that's why we've got to break this cycle.\u201dSen. Jeff Sessions (Ala.), the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee, said a shutdown is possible despite Senate passage of the stopgap.\u201cSome of the Democrats think they can provoke a shutdown and they can blame the Republicans for it,\u201d he said.House Republican leaders might focus now on trying to buy time, possibly by passing a weeklong stopgap.A senior Senate GOP aide discounted that possibility, however.\u201cPassing a weeklong CR isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere. Anything that can\u2019t pass now won\u2019t pass in a week or two weeks,\u201d said the aide.A Senate Democratic aide said Tea Party Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) would not allow Reid to waive procedural rules to approve a one-week stopgap quickly enough to avert a shutdown.Lee declined to say whether he would grant consent in such a scenario.\u201cI\u2019d have to think that through under the totality of the circumstances if we had something like that,\u201d he said.Cruz urged House Republicans to stand firm against any government funding bill that allows the implementation of the Affordable Care Act to move ahead. The law\u2019s open-enrollment period begins Oct. 1.\u201cI hope and believe that when the House takes this up again House Republicans will continue to stand together on the side of the American people,\u201d he said.He said if the House returns the stopgap with new language defunding or delaying ObamaCare, \u201cit will be an opportunity for every Senate Republican to come home, to stand for the principles we all share.\u201dHe spoke to reporters shortly after 25 Senate Republicans voted to let the Senate version of the bill reach a final vote. \n \n \n \n ||||| House and Senate leadership aides in both parties are increasingly convinced the federal government will close for the first time in more than 17 years on Tuesday morning. \n \n There is still time to avoid such a climactic stalemate, the aides acknowledged. But unless there is a dramatic change in momentum, the likelihood that a partisan showdown over government funding and the future of Obamacare could lead to a shutdown has increased dramatically. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Obama to Congress: 'Pay our bills on time' Turn the Table: Threat of a government shutdown \n \n With a special closed-door meeting meeting of House Republicans set for noon Saturday, Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and his top lieutenants have not yet formulated their next play in their quest to keep the government open. It\u2019s not even clear that the House will vote on Saturday. \n \n (PHOTOS: How well do you know the news: Shutdown edition) \n \n There have been repeated contacts between GOP and Democratic leaders and senior aides in recent days but no negotiations of any sort \u2013 or sign those are about to start \u2013 to resolve the standoff. Both sides feel they have made their position known to the other side, and are unwilling to make any concessions at this moment. \n \n Senior House GOP sources say Republicans are likely to send the Senate an amended government-funding bill, but not a proposed one-week stop gap measure. Without that one-week funding bill - needed while Boehner, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and the White House try to reach a compromise agreement - the federal government will beginning shutting down \u201cnon-essential\u201d operations on Tuesday morning. \n \n House Republicans are considering adding several provisions to the two-month, $986 billion continuing resolution passed by the Senate on Friday, and then sending the bill back to the the upper chamber. These options include: a one-year delay of the individual mandate called for in the 2010 Affordable Care Act; an end to government\u2019s contribution to health care for lawmakers and Hill staffers; a repeal of the medical devices tax that helps fund Obamacare; or the elimination of the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a controversial Obamacare provision designed to hold down Medicare costs. \n \n (WATCH - Debt ceiling showdown: By the numbers) \n \n Reid, though, has already warned Boehner that he will block any House GOP funding bill with Obamacare-related provisions. Reid would move to table any House bill that contains those additional provisions favored by House Republicans. Reid could do that with a simple majority vote on Monday, setting up a government shutdown the following morning. \n \n \u201dWe are going to accept nothing that relates to Obamacare. There\u2019s a time and place for everything and this is not that time or place,\u201d Reid said at a press conference following Friday\u2019s vote. \n \n President Barack Obama warned Republicans to \u201cthink about who you\u2019re hurting\u201d by letting the government shut down and said a closure would \u201cthrow a wrench into the gears of our economy at a time when those gears have gained some traction.\u201d \n \n Boehner, however, is under heavy pressure from his tea party and conservative House GOP colleagues to move to stop Obamacare\u2019s implementation, whatever the political risk, including a shutdown. \n \n (VIDEO: Major players to watch in shutdown showdown on Capitol Hill) \n \n Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is privately meeting with hard-line House conservatives to try to get them to hold out against any spending bill that does not defund or delay Obamacare \u2014 set to begin on Oct. 1, the same date government funding runs out. A House GOP debt ceiling package loaded with conservative goodies, including a provision delaying Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate for a year, couldn\u2019t even get enough support to make it to the floor, demonstrating how little sway Boehner holds over his rank-and-file members at this point. \n \n Friday saw a new headache for the Ohio Republican - GOP lawmakers who are pushing back against others in the party who want to end the government contribution to the health insurance of lawmakers and staff. \n \n Some of Boehner\u2019s (R-Ohio) top allies marched into his Capitol office Friday afternoon to beg the speaker not to cut off health-insurance subsidies, which are deeply unpopular with the party base. Under heavy pressure from Capitol Hill \u2014 including Boehner \u2014 the Obama administration ruled in late July that lawmakers could continue receiving the employer contribution even as they enroll in new health insurance exchanges. \n \n (PHOTOS: John Boehner\u2019s life and career) \n \n On Friday, Boehner told the group \u2014 GOP Reps. Tom Cole (Okla.), Duncan Hunter, Jr. (Calif.), Mike Turner (Ohio), Kay Granger (Texas) and Anders Crenshaw (Fla.) \u2014 to canvass the House Republican Conference to find out what might get support, according to sources familiar with the talks. \n \n For the moment, it appears that those lawmakers may win that fight, despite repeated calls from Republicans like Rep. Mike McCaul (Texas) and Sen.David Vitter (La.) to get rid of the subsidy, similar to that other Americans get from their employers. \n \n \u201cFor the last 25 years, members of Congress have been treated like every other federal employee,\u201d said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Calif.), a staunch opponent of cutting those subsidies who spoke up against the idea in a closed party meeting. \u201cThis idea of trying to vilify us now \u2026, that is not the right thing to do.\u201d \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Obama to Congress: \u2018Pay our bills on time\u2019) \n \n Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), once a congressional staffer himself, said he was \u201ca little concerned\u201d with cutting staff health insurance subsidies. \n \n Yet it\u2019s obvious \u2013 and a huge understatement \u2013 to say the House GOP leadership is in a difficult predicament right now. Reid and Obama have refused to yield any ground on either the CR or the even more high stakes debt ceiling fight. The Treasury Department has warned the federal government will hit its $16.7 trillion borrowing limit on Oct. 17. \n \n Obama is not interested in giving away pieces of his health care law just to fund government\u2019s operations. And Boehner\u2019s conservatives \u2013 who are taking their lead from Cruz \u2013 are not interested in giving up on their fight to defund Obamacare. There\u2019s next to no trust in leadership\u2019s strategies, and even less in Boehner himself. \n \n (VIDEO: Mitt Romney thinks there's a better way to stop Obamacare) \n \n The last few weeks have been a game of whack-a-mole for Boehner, Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.): they\u2019ve cycled through a number of strategies to both fund the government, and lift the debt limit. But each time they do, the party\u2019s conservative wing shoots it down and demands a new plan. \n \n GOP leadership will try once again to wrangle support for something \u2013 anything \u2013 on Saturday, when they meet in a closed session in the Capitol basement. House leadership said they might not even vote on a CR Saturday; that vote could slip until Sunday, Republicans lawmakers and aides said. ||||| \u201cThe planning itself is disruptive,\u201d an exhausted Hale told reporters. \u201cPeople are worrying right now about whether their paychecks are going to be delayed, rather than focusing fully on their mission.\u201d \n \n Shutdown planning has eaten up \u201cprobably thousands of hours in employee time better spent on supporting national security,\u201d Hale said. \n \n The tempo was similar at just about every federal agency this week, with managers racing from planning meetings to town hall gatherings with their employees. \n \n Hundreds of thousands of employees who got word Friday that their jobs would not be essential prepared to turn in their government-issued BlackBerrys and \n \n iPhones on Tuesday morning, while colleagues who must still report to the office wondered how their agencies would carry out their missions. \n \n In the Defense Department, about 400,000 civilians will have to stay home if Congress does not pass a bill to keep the government open, Hale said. \n \n Preparing for even a partial closure is a unique challenge for the Defense Department, which has a global reach that includes about 200 schools, 250 commissaries, and 700 hospitals and clinics. The department\u2019s mission is singular within the federal government. The Pentagon must continue to support its combat operations in Afghanistan and deployments in many corners of the world. \n \n In his Office of Public Affairs on Friday, Army Col. Steve Warren was coming to grips with the reality facing his staff. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve got no essentials in here, and I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Warren said, as CNN reported on his flat-screen television about the latest developments on Capitol Hill. \n \n Half the press staff is active- \n \n duty military and the other half civilians, a common mix throughout the agency. The uniformed officers must come to work in a shutdown. \n \n Warren was worrying about manning hundreds of Pentagon Web sites and Twitter and Facebook, which get information to the public. \u201cGuess who runs most of them?\u201d he said. \u201cCivilians who are not essential.\u201d \n \n Some Defense Web sites are run by contractors who will probably be working, since their funding has been approved. But if the federal workers supervising them are furloughed, the contractors may not be able to work. ||||| Among the affects of a federal shutdown: delays in processing passport and visa applications, issuing gun permits, continuing U.S. bankruptcy court cases and approving mortgage applications. \n \n In this Nov. 15, 1995, file photo, a U.S. Park Service police officer stands in front of closed signs at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, during a partial shutdown of the federal government. (Photo: AP file photo) Story Highlights If budget deal is not worked out, federal government will shut down after midnight Monday \n \n Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid payments would continue during a shutdown \n \n About 41 percent of nondefense federal employees would be furloughed \n \n WASHINGTON \u2013 If Democrats and Republicans don't reach a spending deal by midnight Monday, a partial government shutdown will take effect. \n \n The 2013 fiscal year ends at midnight Monday. Many federal programs and activities will stop beginning Tuesday and won't restart until a new deal is in place. \n \n Here's a guide to understanding how Congress got to this stage and how a shutdown would affect you. \n \n Question: Will the entire government come to a standstill if a deal isn't reached? \n \n Answer: No. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and other \"entitlement\" programs that are funded automatically will escape the worst effects. But government agencies that rely on yearly congressional appropriations will be hit a lot harder. That includes giant agencies such as the Pentagon and smaller ones such as the National Park Service. \n \n WHERE DO YOU FIT?: Breaking down the Affordable Care Act \n \n Federal agencies have prepared plans to continue programs they deem critical to maintaining public safety and protecting property despite the shutdown. Employees who perform those critical functions will continue to work and get paid. \n \n For instance, air traffic controllers and firefighters contracted by the National Forest Service would continue to work, but park rangers and researchers who conduct clinical trials at the National Institutes of Health would be furloughed. \n \n USA TODAY estimates that about 41 percent of nondefense federal employees will be furloughed, but the remaining 59 percent will continue working. \n \n Q: Will I still get my mail? \n \n A: Yes. The U.S. Postal Service isn't funded by taxpayers. Independently financed agencies like the Postal Service won't be affected. \n \n Q: How did Congress get in this situation? \n \n A: In a word, partisanship. Differences between Democrats and Republicans are deepening over virtually every issue, and federal spending is the biggest one of all. \n \n A temporary spending measure -- a continuing resolution, or CR -- approved by the GOP-controlled House on Sept. 20 would have kept the government running until mid-December but would have cut funding to implement the Affordable Care Act. \n \n The Democratic-majority Senate rejected that plan, designed to gut President Barack Obama's signature health care law. On Friday the Senate approved its own CR that included money for the law known as \"Obamacare.\" \n \n House leaders are meeting over the weekend to consider their next move. If the House modifies the Senate CR as Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has promised, then the Senate has to approve the amended version before it reaches the White House. \n \n It's unclear if and when those legislative steps will be fulfilled. Short answer: Things remain in limbo. \n \n Q: What will be the impact of a shutdown? \n \n A: All national parks and federal wildlife refuges would be closed for the duration of the shutdown, the Interior Department said Friday. About 9 million visitors were turned away from parks, museums and monuments run by the National Park Service in the mid-1990s, the last time the government shut down temporarily. \n \n About 40 percent of the nation's 2 million federal workers would be furloughed. Though Congress has approved restoring lost pay retroactively in the past, there's no guarantee lawmakers will do that this time. \n \n About 1.4 million active-duty military personnel must remain on the job but won't get paid until a new deal is signed into law. Active National Guard units also must continue to work. Most civilian employees of the Defense Department face furloughs. \n \n Some other possibilities: Delays in processing tens of thousands of passport and visa applications, issuing gun permits, continuing U.S. bankruptcy court cases and approving mortgage applications. \n \n Many congressional and White House staffers also may have to stay home. But members of Congress and the president are exempt from furloughs \n \n Q: Has the government been shut down in the past? \n \n A: Yes. The last one lasted 21 days from Dec. 15, 1995, to Jan. 6, 1996, according to a report by the Congressional Research Service. It came soon after a five-day shutdown that lasted from Nov. 13-19, 1995. A disagreement over tax cuts between then-President Bill Clinton and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., precipitated those shutdowns. \n \n Since 1976, there have been 17 shutdowns, though before the 1980s the government continued operating at reduced levels without furloughing workers. \n \n Q: Isn't there going to be another showdown over raising the debt limit? \n \n A: That's highly likely. Republicans, particularly ultraconservative tea party members, argue the debt ceiling shouldn't be raised unless Congress makes sizable spending cuts. \n \n Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has said the government will run out of money around Oct. 17. In addition to using tax revenues, the Obama administration has to borrow more money to pay bills the nation has already racked up. But Congress has to raise the debt limit to allow increased borrowing -- and that permission won't come without another fight. \n \n If the debt ceiling isn't raised, the U.S. economy will suffer even more that under a shutdown, Obama said Friday. For instance, interest rates on credit cards, student loans and mortgages loans could rise. And the nation's creditworthiness -- and global influence -- would take a beating, experts say, though critics dismiss such talk as hyperbole. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/19IaFCl",

The young man heaved deeply... (Associated Press) \n \n The case concerns a 43-year-old husband and father who traveled to Rome from Mexico to attend Francis' Mass on Sunday in St. Peter's Square. At the end of the Mass, Francis blessed several wheelchair-bound faithful as he always does, including a man possessed by the devil, according to the priest who brought him, the Rev. Juan Rivas. \n \n Francis laid his hands on the man's head and recited a prayer. The man heaved deeply a half-dozen times, shook, then slumped in his wheelchair. \n \n The images, broadcast worldwide, prompted the television station of the Italian bishops' conference to declare that according to several exorcists, there was \"no doubt\" that Francis either performed an exorcism or a simpler prayer to free the man from the devil. \n \n The Vatican was more cautious. In a statement Tuesday, it said Francis \"didn't intend to perform any exorcism. But as he often does for the sick or suffering, he simply intended to pray for someone who was suffering who was presented to him.\" \n \n The Rev. Gabriele Amorth, a leading exorcist for the diocese of Rome, said he performed a lengthy exorcism of his own on the man Tuesday morning and ascertained he was possessed by four separate demons. The case was related to the legalization of abortion in Mexico City, he said. \n \n Amorth told RAI state radio that even a short prayer, without the full rite of exorcism being performed, is in itself a type of exorcism. \n \n \"That was a true exorcism,\" he said of Francis' prayer. \"Exorcisms aren't just done according to the rules of the ritual.\" \n \n Rivas took the Vatican line, saying it was no exorcism but that Francis merely said a prayer to free the man from the devil. \n \n \"Since no one heard what he said, including me who was right there, you can say he did a prayer for liberation but nothing more,\" Rivas wrote on his Facebook page, which was confirmed by his religious order, the Legionaries of Christ. \n \n Fueling the speculation that Francis did indeed perform an exorcism is his frequent reference to Satan in his homilies _ as well as an apparent surge in demand for exorcisms among the faithful despite the irreverent treatment the rite often receives from Hollywood. \n \n Who can forget the green vomit and the spinning head of the possessed girl in the 1973 cult classic \"The Exorcist\"? \n \n In his very first homily as pope on March 14, Francis warned cardinals gathered in the Sistine Chapel the day after he was elected that \"he who doesn't pray to the Lord prays to the devil.\" \n \n He has since mentioned the devil on a handful of occasions, most recently in a May 4 homily when in his morning Mass in the Vatican hotel chapel he spoke of the need for dialogue _ except with Satan. \n \n \"With the prince of this world you can't have dialogue: Let this be clear!\" he warned. \n \n Experts said Francis' frequent invocation of the devil is a reflection both of his Jesuit spirituality and his Latin American roots, as well as a reflection of a Catholic Church weakened by secularization. \n \n \"The devil's influence and presence in the world seems to fluctuate in quantity inversely proportionate to the presence of Christian faith,\" said the Rev. Robert Gahl, a moral theologian at Rome's Pontifical Holy Cross University. \"So, one would expect an upswing in his malicious activity in the wake of de-Christianization and secularization\" in the world and a surge in things like drug use, pornography and superstition. \n \n In recent years, Rome's pontifical universities have hosted several courses for would-be exorcists on the rite, updated in 1998 and contained in a little red leather-bound booklet. The rite is relatively brief, consisting of blessings with holy water, prayers and an interrogation of the devil in which the exorcist demands to know the devil's name, how many are present and when they will leave the victim. \n \n Only a priest authorized by a bishop can perform an exorcism, and canon law specifies that the exorcist must be \"endowed with piety, knowledge, prudence and integrity of life.\" \n \n While belief in the devil is consistent with church teaching, the Holy See does urge prudence, particularly to ensure that the victim isn't merely psychologically ill. \n \n The Rev. Giulio Maspero, a Rome-based systematic theologian who has witnessed or participated in more than a dozen exorcisms, says he's fairly certain that Francis' prayer on Sunday was either a full-fledged exorcism or a more simple prayer to \"liberate\" the young man from demonic possession. \n \n He noted that the placement of the pope's hands on the man's head was the \"typical position\" for an exorcist to use. \n \n \"When you witness something like that _ for me it was shocking _ I could feel the power of prayer,\" he said in a phone interview, speaking of his own previous experiences. \n \n The Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, sought to temper speculation that what occurred was a full-fledged exorcism. While he didn't deny it outright _ he said Francis hadn't \"intended\" to perform one _ he stressed that the intention of the person praying is quite important. \n \n Late Tuesday, the director of TV2000, the television of the Italian bishops' conference, went on the air to apologize for the earlier report. \n \n \"I don't want to attribute to him a gesture that he didn't intend to perform,\" said the director, Dino Boffo. \n \n That said, Francis' actions and attitude toward the devil are not new: As archbishop of Buenos Aires, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio frequently spoke about the devil in our midst. \n \n In the book \"Heaven and Earth,\" Bergoglio devoted the second chapter to \"The Devil\" and said in no uncertain terms that he believes in the devil and that Satan's fruits are \"destruction, division, hatred and calumny.\" \n \n \"Perhaps its greatest success in these times has been to make us think that it doesn't exist, that everything can be traced to a purely human plan,\" he wrote. \n \n Italian newspapers noted that the late Pope John Paul II performed an exorcism in 1982 _ near the same spot where Francis prayed over the young disabled man Sunday. \n \n _____ \n \n Follow Nicole Winfield at http://www.twitter.com/nwinfield ||||| Image copyright AP Image caption The young man opened his mouth as the Pope laid his hands on his head, then convulsed and slumped in his wheelchair \n \n The Vatican has denied claims that Pope Francis performed an exorcism, after TV images showed a man apparently reacting to him putting his hands on his head. \n \n The encounter - during Sunday Mass - was shown on a TV channel owned by the Italian bishops' conference. \n \n The station quoted exorcists as saying there was \"no doubt\" the Pope had either performed an exorcism or a prayer to free the man from the devil. \n \n Its director later apologised for \"having altered the truth\". \n \n The Pope's spokesman said he \"did not intend to perform any exorcism\". \n \n \"Rather as he frequently does with the sick or suffering who come his way, he simply intended to pray for a suffering person,\" said Federico Lombardi in a statement. \n \n The footage shows a young man, who is in a wheelchair, opening his mouth and either screaming or breathing deeply as the Pope puts his hands on his head and prays for him during the Mass in St Peter's Square. \n \n The man then convulses and slumps in his chair. \n \n On Tuesday, the director of the TV station which broadcast the pictures, TV 2000, apologised for the report, saying: \"I don't want to attribute to him a gesture that he didn't intend to perform.\" \n \n \"I apologise for having altered the truth of the facts and for the people who are involved, in particular I apologise to the Holy Father,\" said Dino Boffo. \n \n Religious figures in Rome had insisted the act had been an exorcism. \n \n They included the Vatican's former chief exorcist, Gabriele Amorth, who was quoted by Italian media as saying the act \"was an exorcism alright\" and that he had since performed his own exorcism on the young man, who he said was called Angelo. \n \n Exorcism is the ancient practice of driving out demons or evil spirits from a person or place they are thought to possess.

They may be liberals on many subjects, but when it comes to Wall Street, they tow the line. And the Street is not afraid to show its appreciation. \n \n 2 of 2 ||||| NEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- The conventional wisdom is that the antipathy -- or perhaps I should say \"alleged antipathy\" -- between President Obama and Wall Street is mutual. Obama and the Democrats have thrown Wall Street under the bus, the story goes, and the Street has reacted by showering contributions on Mitt Romney. \n \n Bullfeathers. Obama has hardly been antagonistic toward Wall Street, as indicated, most recently, by his succumbing to congressional Republicans and supporting a horrid \"JOBS Act\" that blinks a green light to stock fraud. The other part of this myth is also untrue. While the so-called financial-services industry is definitely flocking to Romney and his hard-right running mate, they haven't abandoned Obama and congressional Democrats, especially the latter. \n \n There's no question that the Street loves Romney and would be ecstatic if the Republicans gained control of both houses of Congress. How could they not feel warmly toward one of their own? A look at the top contributors to Romney , available at Opensecrets.org, indicates just how much of a Wall Street darling he has become. His chief source of contributions comes from executives ofand, while Obama's principal contributors work for the University of California,, a corporate law firm called DLA Piper and Harvard University. \n \n Mind you, that's just counting sums going directly into the candidates' coffers. Financial-industry execs are also the top contributors to Super PACs and other outside spending groups, and they're showing their dollars overwhelmingly to conservative causes by a wide margin, $44.2 million versus $4.8 million for liberal PACs. \n \n That's a big shift from 2008, when the financial-services industry bet heavily on Obama and the Democrats. Goldman partners and associates, for instance, gave 75% of their contributions to Democrats in 2008; now the number is 27%. But Obama is still getting a considerable portion of his financing from that sector -- $12.2 million, versus $28.6 million for Romney. \n \n Clearly the GOP hasn't given up on Democrats, and they certainly have no reason to do so. A good example is the New York congressional delegation, which is solidly Democratic -- and solidly backed by the Street. \n \n The incumbent junior senator, Kirsten Gillibrand, is up for re-election this year against conservative Republican Wendy Long. Individuals and PACs from the securities and investment industry have poured $2.7 million into her campaign coffers, second only to lawyers, and are among the principal sugar daddies in a campaign in which she has exceeded Long in fundraising by a ridiculous margin, raising $13.8 million versus $337,000 for the Republican. Nobody seems to expect Long to win, and that includes law firms, even though she's a former litigation partner with Kirkland & Ellis. Wall Street is certainly not wasting any money on that lost cause. \n \n Law firms are Long's biggest source of contributions, totaling $38,550 to date. Meanwhile, the securities and investment industry has doled out $31,750 to her campaign. That is about the best numerical indication that the Republican is most definitely a long shot. (The polls , which show her far behind Gillibrand, agree.) \n \n Why back a Democrat and not a reliable conservative like Long? It's not just that Long doesn't have an icicle's chance in hell of winning. It's also that Gillibrand, like many on her side of the aisle, is no enemy of Wall Street. In fact, a few months ago she was being hailed in the business press as a \"champion of Wall Street.\" In that capacity, she has taken over the mantle from the senior senator from New York, stalwart liberal Democrat Charles Schumer, who has had to temper his devotion to Wall Street now that he has become \"more of a national Democratic leader,\" New York's Capital Web site reported in February. \n \n \"Meanwhile,\" the Web site reported, \"Kirsten Gillibrand has quietly overcome considerable skepticism about her on Wall Street to become a go-to advocate for the financial-services industry in her own right.\" And the Street is clutching the skepticism-overcoming junior senator tightly to its collective bosom, judging from its campaign spending. Wouldn't you give money to Gillibrand over a long shot (or even a short shot) challenger, if you were a banker or brokerage exec? \n \n 1 of 2 \n \n You might do it to a worthy politician, or even do it if he or she isn't noted as a friend of Wall Street. Probably the best example is a New York congressman with a not-so-well-earned reputation for hostility to Wall Street, Gary Ackerman.",

    "document": "BEIJING \u2014 In the whirlwind of growth that is modern China, the loss of ancient traditions often provokes dismay and outrage. \n \n But people across the country cheered recently when officials in eastern China said they were doing away with a 600-year-old local custom: the slaughter of thousands of dogs to be eaten at an autumn festival. \n \n The Jinhua Hutou Dog Meat Festival, as it is called, was abruptly canceled last week after local officials were shamed by an online campaign begun by animal rights advocates. Gruesome photographs taken at past festivals that show canine carcasses, some bloody and others cooked, circulated on Chinese microblogs, creating popular pressure against the festival, which was set for October. \n \n Pet ownership has grown rapidly among the Chinese, as has a greater consciousness of animal rights. In the Mao era, the Communist Party condemned pets as a byproduct of bourgeois decadence. But these days, dogs and cats (and all manner of creatures, including rabbits and birds) have become accouterments of Chinese middle-class living. What was once slated for the pantry is now housed in a playpen. \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cI once had a pet dog, and I\u2019m not a huge fan of dog meat,\u201d said a 36-year-old man in Guangdong Province who is credited by a Chinese journalist with helping start the campaign against the festival on Sina Weibo, a popular microblog platform. The blogger declined to give his name and agreed to chat only over the Internet. \u201cThe reason why I posted that message online is very simple \u2014 that is, I don\u2019t want to see dog lovers\u2019 feelings get hurt,\u201d he said. \n \n Other grass-roots animal-rescue efforts have also gotten results. Last April, a man spotted a truck on a Beijing highway that was packed with more than 500 dogs being shipped to slaughterhouses that supply restaurants in northern China. The man put out a call on the Internet to stop the vehicle, and soon it was blocked by more than 200 people; the crowd rescued the dogs after paying $17,000. \n \n \u201cI believe China is going through a Chinese animal liberation movement, a bottom-up movement, gaining huge momentum in the past year, very much with the help of the Internet and Weibo, together with the younger generation growing up with cats and dogs as family pets,\u201d Deborah Cao, a professor at Griffith University in Australia who studies animal rights law, said in an e-mail interview. \n \n The dog meat festival, held in the Wucheng district of Jinhua in Zhejiang Province, is part of an annual three-day temple fair. The dog market has been part of the fair for centuries, according to the district government\u2019s Web site. Local folklore says the tradition of feasting on dogs originated when Hu Dahai, a rebel battling Yuan Dynasty rulers in the 14th century, ordered all the dogs in Jinhua to be slaughtered because their barking had warned rebels in the city of his army\u2019s approach. His soldiers were treated to dog meat, the story goes, and eating dog has been a custom at local temple fairs ever since. \n \n The Zhejiang Jinhua Daily said in an article on Sept. 20 that the market at the annual temple fair was renamed as a \u201cdog meat festival\u201d about a decade ago to increase business. Traditionally, local people brought cooked dog meat to sell, but that changed in recent years because of talk that some of the sellers had poisoned the dogs. Merchants started trucking in live dogs and killing, flaying and cooking them on the spot to prove that the meat was fresh. A local journalist said at least 5,000 dogs are killed. \n \n Dog is popular in winter across much of China because the meat is believed to have warming properties. Practitioners of Chinese traditional medicine say that dog meat imbues the eater with energy and strength. \n \n Microblog posts criticizing this year\u2019s Jinhua festival first appeared early this month. The blogger from Guangdong wrote on Sept. 6: \u201cThere are thousands of dog eaters gathering there. People slaughter dogs mercilessly, the blood of the dead dogs flows like a river, the horrible screams of dogs pierce the sky.\u201d \n \n The outcry quickly gathered momentum. Last week, a few Chinese newspapers wrote editorials. The campaign caught on with celebrities who have millions of microblog followers. The Wucheng district authorities said on Weibo on Sept. 19 that they were canceling the fair. The next morning, they explained the decision was \u201cin full respect of the public\u2019s opinion.\u201d \n \n Some food lovers are disappointed. One blogger, Gong Wangping, wrote: \u201cI personally think dog meat is like alcohol. They are both components of our ancient Chinese culture.\u201d ||||| A traditional dog meat festival with a 600-year history of slaughtering and tasting dogs in Zhejiang Province has been canceled after outrage and protests from tens of thousands of animal-rights activists. \n \n \n \n The annual three-day-long festival was planned for October 18 in Hutou Village of Jinhua City, where 5,000 to 10,000 dogs would be butchered on the streets and served to villagers on dining tables. \n \n \n \n Participants in past festivals described horrific scenes they called \"doomsday for dogs,\" when dogs were kept in cages with their eyes scratched out and their mouths wrapped up by iron wires, waiting for customers to pick them up and get slaughtered in front of hundreds of other dogs. \n \n \n \n \"People actually enjoyed killing them in various ways at the festival,\" wrote Wang Lingyi, an animal-welfare volunteer from Hangzhou. \"I've seen the dogs being stabbed, strangled and even beaten into comas and thrown into boiling water. Some dogs woke up in the extremely hot water and they struggled, but the vendors kept pushing them, plucking their fur.\" \n \n \n \n \"On those days, the streets were washed by blood while the air was filled by dogs' desperate howls,\" said an online participant who posted pictures and videos. \n \n \n \n A campaign to boycott the coming festival was started by animal-rights activists last week on several online platforms. On Weibo.com, a call for residents to put an end to the slaughterers' festival was forwarded 55,000 times in one day. \n \n \n \n \"The government called it a traditional festival, but we know they are only attracting vendors into the city to boost economy,\" Shen Sheng from Jiangsu Province wrote in an open letter to netizens. \"Although the laws are still lacking to protect the animals, we will not allow them to carry out such a massacre under our eyes.\" \n \n \n \n Jinhua city officials told Shanghai Daily yesterday that the festival was canceled due to the online outrage. They acknowledged that such a festival is no longer needed after continuing since the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). \n \n \n \n According to an official surnamed Zhang, the decision was made on Monday evening after a heated discussion among government officials and village representatives. But it was no easy task persuading everyone that a 600-year-old tradition should be axed, she said. \n \n \n \n \"Some villagers argued that they had emotional attachments to the festival, as it had been passed from generation to generation, while some said it should be listed as the city's cultural heritage,\" said Zhang. \n \n \n \n The habit of dog eating in Jinhua can be traced to a Ming Dynasty legend. A general tried to lead his army to strike the city late at night, but failed several times because whenever they got close to the city, dogs would bark to raise the alarm. The general decided to kill all the dogs in the region and the troops finally conquered the city, and they celebrated by eating the dogs they slaughtered. \n \n",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Puppy lovers, rejoice. Officials in eastern China last week canceled the Jinhua Hutou Dog Meat Festival. If that name makes you a little queasy\u2014well, there's good reason for that. The 600-year-old tradition saw at least 5,000 of dogs slaughtered on the spot, and served up as the main dish. As the story goes, the festival stemmed from a tradition begun in the 14th century, when the barking dogs that revealed an army's position were fed to the soldiers on the general's angry orders, reports the New York Times. The ancient custom was scuttled following a Web campaign staged by animal-rights advocates, who posted graphic images from past festivals of cooked dogs and leftover carcasses. The People's Daily shares the observations of one blogger, \"I've seen the dogs being stabbed, strangled, and even beaten into comas and thrown into boiling water.\" Some say it's an encouraging sign that, as pet ownership gains steam in China, so too does the animal-rights movement. But not everyone is on board. Wrote another blogger, \"I personally think dog meat is like alcohol. They are both components of our ancient Chinese culture.\"",

    "document": "Please confirm your birth date: Please confirm your birth date: \n \n Please enter a valid date Please enter your full birth year \n \n This content is restricted. This content is restricted. \n \n Three years ago this week, an intoxicated Christine O'Donnell showed up at the apartment of a 25-year-old Philadelphian and ended up spending the night in his bed. Here's his story\u2014and photos\u2014of his escapade with the would-be Delaware senator. \n \n I barely knew Christine when she turned up at my door at around eight o'clock on the night of Halloween. We'd met for the first and only time three months earlier when my two roommates and I signed the lease on our apartment: Christine's aunt owned the place we were moving into, and she happened to be up from Delaware visiting at the time. But we'd only spent about five minutes together that day and we hadn't spoken much, and I hadn't thought of her since. \n \n Yet here she was standing outside my door with a friend. And both of them were pretty tipsy. \n \n She asked if she and her friend could come inside our apartment to change into their costumes. She couldn't change at her aunt's place, she said, because she was sleeping and she didn't want to wake her up. Would we mind if she used our bathroom instead? \n \n It was a pretty strange request. Sure, weird stuff happens on Halloween, but I barely knew her, and it isn't every day that someone shows up at your front door and asks to change into their ladybug costume. But I told her it was fine and she was welcome to use our place to get ready. \n \n It didn't take long before the two women\u2014who'd clearly been drinking\u2014were sitting on my couch, beers in hand, trying to convince my roommate and me to join them for a night on the town. Christine was in the holiday spirit dressed in her ladybug outfit. Her friend, who had a female pirate costume on, was much more quiet and reserved. She barely spoke all night. \n \n It was a Wednesday evening, and my roommate and I hadn't been planning to go out. We both had to get up pretty early the next morning for work. But Christine was insistent that we join them, and she wasn't taking no for an answer. \"Come on, guys! Let's go! Just throw something on!\" she said. \n \n The costume that I wore for the Halloween a year before\u2014a boy scout's uniform that belonged to a friend\u2014was still sitting in my closet. So that made it easy. But my roommate had no idea what to put on. \n \n Christine immediately came up with an idea. She pointed to a cardboard box in the kitchen\u2014the kind that 12-packs of Coca-Cola come in\u2014and told him to cut a hole in the middle and put it on top of his head. We weren't sure what she was suggesting. \n \n \"You can go as a cokehead!\" she said, bursting into laughter. \n \n With our costume situation sorted out, we headed to South Street, where lots of bars in Philadelphia are located. Half an hour later, the four of us were seated at a table and knocking back beers. \n \n It really didn't take very long for Christine to make her move. She'd grabbed my hand on the way from the apartment to South Street, so I can't say I was totally surprised when she leaned in to kiss me soon after we arrived at the bar. \n \n I could tell when we first met that Christine was older than me. I was 25, and although I never asked her age, I'd have guessed she was in her early 30s. It was only recently that I found out her real age and learned she was in her late 30s when we hooked up. There's a 14-year gap between us, but she looks good for her age. I don't think I'd heard the word \"cougar\" yet at that point, but that's probably what I'd call her. \n \n Aggressive is another word I'd use to describe her. At the bar, she confessed to me that her aunt really hadn't been sleeping. She hadn't even gone to her apartment to check, she said. She had remembered me from our five-minute meeting the previous summer, and used the story about her aunt as an excuse to knock on my door. She'd set her sights on me from the beginning. \n \n Christine was pretty intense, and she was pretty outspoken that night, but we didn't talk politics much. Her aunt had told me that Christine ran for Senate a year earlier and had lost, so I knew a bit about her background. But the most political she got that night was when she said she attended lots of events in Washington that attracted congressmen and senators. \"It would be nice to have a good-looking young man to attend those with me,\" she added. \n \n We'd probably knocked back five Heinekens when Christine leaned over and whispered in my ear that she wanted to go back to my place. Before we could go, though, she told me to ask her friend if she'd mind if I drove Christine home later that evening. That was odd. I guess Christine didn't want to come across as a slut in her friend's eyes for going home with me, so she wanted me to bring it up her friend first. \n \n I did what I was told and asked her friend if she had any objection to me hanging out with Christine a little longer provided I took her home later on in the evening. She didn't, and a few minutes after that, we were all headed back to my apartment. Christine's friend got in her car and went home. My roommate went to his bedroom and went to sleep. And Christine and I got cozy on the couch and popped open another beer. \n \n Things got physical on the couch pretty quickly. It wasn't long before we'd moved from the living room to my bed. \n \n I won't get into the nitty gritty details of what happened between the sheets that evening. But I will say that it wasn't half as exciting as I'd been hoping it would be. Christine was a decent kisser, but as soon as soon as her clothes came off and she was naked in my bed, Christine informed me that she was a virgin. \n \n \"You've got to be kidding,\" I said. She didn't explain at the time that she was a \"born-again virgin.\" She made it seem like she'd never had sex in her life, which seemed pretty improbable for a woman her age. And she made it clear that she was planning on staying a virgin that night. But there were signs that she wasn't very experienced sexually. When her underwear came off, I immediately noticed that the waxing trend had completely passed her by. \n \n Obviously, that was a big turnoff, and I quickly lost interest. I said goodnight, rolled over, and went to sleep. It was almost four o'clock in the morning. I had to get up at 6:30 to go to work. \n \n Christine wasn't in the best of shape when my alarm clock went off three hours later. I was hungover and exhausted and we'd both had about the same amount to drink, so I'm guessing she was feeling even worse. I got up and started to get dressed and told Christine she'd need to get up, too. But she clearly didn't want to budge, and even after I'd reminded her a few times, she was still under the covers. Did she think I was going to leave for work and let her sleep in my bed? \n \n When she finally did get up and dressed and we got in the car, Christine couldn't remember exactly where her friend lived. We circled around for about 20 minutes before we found it, and I dropped her off in the parking lot next to her car, as she asked me to. We said goodbye and exchanged phone numbers and email addresses. But there wasn't a whole lot of back and forth. I didn't even try to give her a kiss goodbye. \n \n I wasn't planning on contacting Christine after our night together. Things hadn't gone so great\u2014especially the part that took place in my bedroom\u2014and I didn't see any reason to try and see her again. But two or three days later, she emailed me to ask me if I wanted to hang out again. I made an excuse. But she didn't take a hint and emailed or called a few more times over the next couple of weeks before I was forced to make it clear to her that I wasn't interested. \n \n Things worked out for the best, though. A few weeks later, Christine started dating my roommate. They went out for over a year, and it was a little awkward the first few times Christine came over to visit him at our apartment and we all had to make conversation in the living room. But that passed pretty quickly. And in case you're wondering, he never had sex with her either, as far as I know. \n \n When I heard several months ago that Christine had decided to run again, I didn't take it very seriously. And I never expected in a million years that she'd end up winning the primary. But she did, and the morning after the election, I sat in disbelief as I watched the news on TV. For a second, I thought I might be hearing things and I went over to my computer and pulled up CNN.com to check if it was true. It was. \n \n God, I hope the same thing doesn't happen next week. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Update: \n \n O'Donnell has responded to this story.

The charges: misogyny and reckless link-baiting. \n \n \"Today, we are all Christine O'Donnell,\" wrote Salon's Justin Elliott. \n \n He was one of several journalists and bloggers to criticize Gawker for posting an anonymous account by a Philadelphia man claiming to have gone home with Delaware Senate candidate on Halloween night three years ago, following a night of drinking. \n \n But editor Remy Stern told The Upshot that Gawker ran the item because it's \"a great story\" and pushed back against the misogyny charge, arguing that the alleged incident was worth noting because O'Donnell's private actions -- according to the anonymous writer -- run counter to her public persona as an advocate of Christian conservative values. \n \n \"If it was any politician whose private life diverged from his public life in such an interesting way, we'd be interested in that,\" Stern said. \"It had nothing to do with her being a woman.\" \n \n Despite the sensational headline -- \"I Had a One-Night Stand With Christine O'Donnell\" -- the two never actually had sex.

Stern said Gawker paid in the \"low four figures\" for the O'Donnell story, but also did its due diligence in checking the accuracy of the man's claims. \n \n Stern said that the man approached Gawker about 10 days ago. He had shopped it elsewhere but wanted it to be told correctly, and Gawker allowed him to do it first-person. \n \n \"From an editorial standpoint, it was compelling to hear it from his own words,\" Stern said, adding that \"it's a good story and that's why we did it.\" \n \n Gawker Media chief Nick Denton, in a staff memo, described the O'Donnell post as \"an example of brilliant packaging,\" with a good composite image on the front and compelling writing. \n \n \"And this points to a general rule on the Web,\" Denton said. \"Writers are successful to the extent that they can sublimate their egotism and get out of the way of the story.\" ||||| Twitter is abuzz with reactions to a tell-all posted anonymously today by a man claiming to have had a one-night stand with Christine O'Donnell three years ago. \n \n In one of the most-retweeted reactions, journalist Dave Weigel called the account the \"sleaziest... story in memory.\" \n \n Blogger Meghan McCain took particular umbrage in a series of posts: \n \n Wow gawker, just wow.

I would literally use the military to keep them in if I had to. We're not leaving town until we restore these defense cuts. We are not leaving town until we restore the intel cuts. \n \n Graham would use the military to force members of Congress to not just vote on the bill \u2014 but to pass it. Graham didn't say \"until I get an up-or-down vote on restoring defense cuts.\" He said \"until we restore these defense cuts.\" \n \n In other words, Graham is proposing that his first act as president would be to use the military to force the legislative branch to pass his agenda. \n \n Is Senator Graham announcing his plans for a self-coup? \n \n If taken literally, Graham is basically announcing his plan to stage a coup: he is saying that if he gains control of the executive branch, he will use his authority as commander in chief to overcome the separation of powers and force the legislative branch to do his bidding, instead of allowing it to act as an independent branch of the government. \n \n Political scientists often refer to that type of action as a \"self-coup,\" a situation in which a legitimate leader uses the military or other armed force to unlawfully seize more power than is permitted under the constitution of the country in question. Usually that's a permanent seizure of power and a total shutdown of the legislature, so what Graham is proposing is a relatively mild version. But as silver linings go, \"it's a coup, but only a small one\" isn't very comforting. \n \n Although I suppose that's one way to deal with congressional deadlock. \n \n There is no universe in which this is remotely legal behavior \n \n Maybe Graham was just joking (he sounded serious) or just speaking figuratively to make a point about his determination to restore cut military funding (okay, but weird way to do it). \n \n If he was being remotely serious, though, this proposal is dramatically different from anything that is actually legal \u2014 such as, say, the Senate leadership using the Capitol police or sergeant-at-arms to ensure that the Senate has a quorum. \n \n That happened in 1988, when Democratic leadership had the Capitol police carry Republican Senator Bob Packwood feet-first into the Senate chamber to ensure a quorum. Harry Reid threatened to use similar methods more recently when he was Senate majority leader. \n \n But what the Senate did in 1988 was compel senators' presence, not compel them to vote a certain way. It was permitted by the Senate rules, which say that \"a majority of the Senators present may direct the Sergeant at Arms to request, and, when necessary, to compel the attendance of the absent Senators\" to reach a quorum. And it was the Senate policing itself, and thus did not violate the separation of powers. \n \n What Lindsey Graham is proposing is to physically force members of Congress to vote how he commands. His plan violates constitutional separation of powers in just about the most extreme way imaginable, by forcing the executive branch's will on the legislature. And it is a pretty safe bet that Senate rules do not grant the president authority to have the 101st Airborne Division occupy the Capitol until Congress votes the way he wants. \n \n Graham's proposal is so astonishing that it's pretty much impossible to believe that's what he really meant. He is a mainstream politician and an attorney who served as an Air Force JAG. Surely \u2014 surely \u2014 he is not actually proposing such an unconstitutional action. \n \n .... Right? \n \n Update: Graham's spokesperson has clarified to Bloomberg that when Graham said \"I would literally use the military to keep them in if I had to,\" that statement was \"not to be taken literally.\" Glad that's been cleared up. \n \n Watch: President Obama explain the polarizing nature of modern politics",

The commanding admiral was so impressed with the escapade that they offered Smalls a job as pilot of the Planter, which was turned over the Union Army as a transport. \n \n Smalls became a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre in the North, and was tapped to recruit black slaves to form units to fight against the Confederacy. He eventually was elected to Congress. After the war, Smalls and the Planter were well known among local African Americans. As the Planter's captain, he transported many freed slaves to newly created farm communities at Hilton Head and Port Royal. \n \n The Planter returned to service as a cotton cargo hauler along the South Carolina coast. It ran aground off Cape Romain in 1876 during a salvage operation and in time, its exact location became forgotten. \n \n NOAA officials resurrected the Planter search in 2008. Underwater archaeologists believed they found the ship in 2010 in 12 feet of water and 10 feet of sand in Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge. Because the ship lies inside an important sea turtle breeding area, it\u2019s not likely that it will be salvaged. \n \n NOAA and NABS put together this website about the history of Smalls, the Planter and other ships during the slave era. ||||| View of south end of Cape Island in Cape Romain National Wildlife Refuge in South Carolina. The remains of the Civil War-era steamer Planter are located within sight of an 1857 lighthouse. \n \n The wreck of a ship once commandeered by slaves and sailed to freedom during the Civil War has very likely been found. \n \n The shipwrecked Planter almost certainly rests beneath 10 to 15 feet (3 to 5 meters) of sand and water off Cape Romain between Charleston and Georgetown, South Carolina, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced this week. The ship went down in 1876, 14 years after its enslaved captain and crew ran it out of Charleston Harbor and turned it over to the U.S. Navy. \n \n The story of the Planter is one of heroism. The ship was completed in 1860. The next year, an enslaved young man named Robert Smalls came aboard as a deck hand. Smalls had more freedom than most slaves, and was allowed to keep some of his pay and move around the Charleston waterfront with some autonomy. (Smalls may have been his owner's son, according to his descendants. Smalls' mother was a slave in the home of a man named John K. McKee, and the family suspects that McKee's son Henry, who inherited the pair of slaves in 1848, fathered Smalls.) [See Images of the Planter and Shipwreck Site] \n \n Audacious plan \n \n Robert Smalls, who piloted the Planter to freedom during the Civil War. Credit: Library of Congres \n \n Smalls worked his way up to the position of wheelsman \u2014 the person who steers the ship. During the Civil War, the Planter was rented to the Confederates and used as a supply, transport and dispatch ship, running cannons, soldiers and other wartime necessities along the coast. Most of the crew were enslaved African-Americans. \n \n The idea of commandeering the ship started as a joke, Smalls would later tell Harper's Weekly magazine. But soon it turned quite serious: The nine African-American men of the crew met in secret at Smalls' house and planned their escape. They put away provisions in the hold and waited for their chance. \n \n It came on May 12, 1862. The ship had just returned to Charleston Harbor after picking up some cannons from nearby Cole Island. The plan was to deliver the weaponry to Fort Ripley the next day. That evening, however, the white men in the crew went ashore for a soiree. Smalls and his crew jumped at the opportunity, first steaming to pick up their relatives in the North Atlantic wharf and then sailing right out of the harbor. Smalls blew the ship whistle at the Confederate checkpoints, convincing those guarding the harbor that the ship was simply getting an early start on the day's deliveries. \n \n \"Once out of range of the rebel guns the white flag was raised, and the Planter steamed directly for the blockading [Union] steamer Augusta,\" Harper's explained in June 1862. \n \n Heroism and loss \n \n Smalls delivered the Planter and the 16 escaped slaves on board to the U.S. Navy. He then piloted the ship in action against the Confederacy, and was later transferred to pilot other ships in a new post in the U.S. Army. He'd have another brush with heroism in 1863, again on the Planter. The ship was moving supplies along Folly Island creek near Charleston when it came under heavy shelling from Confederate guns. The captain of the ship ordered that the ship be beached and abandoned his station. Smalls instead piloted the Planter to safety. As a result, the ship's captain was dismissed, and Smalls promoted. He was the first African-American to become a ship captain in the U.S. military. [Shipwrecks Gallery: Secrets of the Deep] \n \n After the war, the Army sold the ship to a private company, which turned right around and sold it to its original owner in South Carolina, John Ferguson. The ship soon went back to its pre-war duties delivering supplies up and down the South Carolina coast. Smalls went on to represent South Carolina in the U.S. House of Representatives. \n \n In 1876, the Planter was attempting to tow a ship that had run aground at Cape Romain up the coast from Charleston. In the process, the Planter hit a shoal and sprung a leak. The captain beached the ship in hopes of repairing the hull, but a storm blew in and battered her beyond repair. The crew salvaged everything they could, including pistons, life boats, engines, cabin doors and even blankets and mattresses. \n \n Rediscovery \n \n Shifting sands have long covered the remains of the Planter, and the site of the wreck was lost. NOAA's Maritime Heritage Progam set out to find the wreck, reviewing original accounts of the accident and historic charts of the shoreline as it was in 1876. Once a likely location was pinpointed, NOAA researchers used a magnetometer towed beneath the water in search of large quantities of iron. \n \n The found one such cluster 9 feet (3 m) below the ocean bottom, near where the shore would have been when the Planter wrecked. The area is environmentally sensitive (Cape Romain, up the coast from Charleston, is home to a national wildlife refuge), so attempts to uncover the wreck will need to be taken with care, NOAA reported. What's more, the Planter is likely fragmented from the relentless beating of the waves. The state of South Carolina will decide whether to excavate the ship's remains or to simply mark the spot in remembrance of this storied vessel. \n \n Follow Stephanie Pappas on Twitter and Google+.

(Credit: Naval History and Heritage Command) \n \n NOAA announced today it has determined the probable location of the remains of the Civil War-era sidewheel steamer Planter, which gained national fame in 1862 when a group of enslaved African Americans commandeered the Confederate Navy transport ship in a daring escape to freedom. \n \n The announcement was made in Charleston, South Carolina, where NOAA\u2019s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries released a report on its search for the Planter and plans for an interpretative sign and future exhibit dedicated to the Planter\u2019s legacy. The effort to find the Planter supports NOAA\u2019s Voyage to Discovery initiative, which seeks to highlight African-American maritime history through education, archaeology, science and underwater exploration. \n \n Under the leadership of Robert Smalls, the ship\u2019s steersman, crew members navigated the steamer out of Charleston Harbor on May 12, 1862, and delivered the vessel to the United States Navy. The New York Herald called the escape \u201cone of the most daring and heroic adventures since the war was commenced.\u201d \n \n The notoriety generated by the escape and capture of the Planter led to Smalls eventually becoming the first African-American master in the U.S. Navy and a member of Congress representing South Carolina \u2013 the state where he was born a slave. NOAA\u2019s report helps fill gaps in the largely untold story of Robert Smalls and the Planter, which wrecked on a beach in March 1876 while trying to tow a grounded schooner. \n \n \n \n In an attempt to answer lingering questions about the Planter\u2019s fate, NOAA researchers reviewed historical documents and analyzed oceanographic and meteorological conditions that may have existed at the time of the Planter\u2019s loss. The likely site where the vessel came to rest, off Cape Romain between Charleston and Georgetown, South Carolina, was confirmed with magnetometer and hydro-probing surveys that detected the presence of large concentrations of iron consistent with the remains of a sunken ship. The vessel\u2019s remains are buried under 10-15 feet of sand and water in an environmentally sensitive area. \n \n \u201cOur interest in finding the Planter is about more than just unlocking the past and secrets of the deep,\u201d said Daniel J. Basta, NOAA\u2019s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries director. \u201cThis expedition is an opportunity to highlight African-American contributions to the country\u2019s maritime heritage and inspire young people to consider careers in marine science to help expand the boundaries of ocean exploration.\u201d \n \n NOAA's report, \"The Search for Planter,\" is available online. (Credit: NOAA) \n \n Following Smalls\u2019 commandeering of the Planter on May 12, 1862, the ship continued to be used by the U.S. Navy as a dispatch and supply vessel with Smalls as pilot. However, by September of that year, the Navy transferred the craft to the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps, where it supported Army operations around Charleston, Port Royal and Beaufort. \n \n News accounts suggest that after the war, Smalls and the Planter were well known among local African Americans. As the Planter\u2019s captain, he transported many freed slaves to newly created farmsteads and communities at Hilton Head and Port Royal. With Smalls at the helm, the Planter was reported as the ship that carried black dignitaries and passengers to the ceremony of the symbolic raising of the Fort Sumter flag which had been lowered after the fort\u2019s capture by the Confederates. \n \n On March 25, 1876, while trying to tow a grounded schooner, Planter sprang a plank in the bow and began to take on water in the hold. The captain elected to beach the steamer and repair the plank, hoping to get off the beach with the next high tide. However, stormy seas battered the Planter as the tide rose and the ship was too badly damaged and had to be abandoned. Upon hearing of its loss, Robert Smalls was reported to have said that he felt as if he had lost a member of his family. \n \n A copy of the report and media images will be available for download at: http://www.voyagetodiscovery.org/planter.htm. \n \n \n \n NOAA\u2019s mission is to understand and predict changes in the Earth's environment, from the depths of the ocean to the surface of the sun, and to conserve and manage our coastal and marine resources.

Faced with complaints, Gap said they wouldn't make the change after all. For all I know, this was a Salad Cream-style publicity stunt. \n \n A far more sensible response to Gladwell came yesterday from the founders of Twitter. Ev Williams and Biz Stone dismissed Gladwell's argument, saying that Twitter, like any communication tool, could be used as a complement to activism but could not replace action. \n \n Williams said: \"Anyone who\u2019s claiming that sending a tweet by itself is activism, that\u2019s ludicrous \u2014 but no one\u2019s claiming that, at least no one that\u2019s credible.\" \n \n That's the most important point \u2013 and it's the reason why I haven't bothered writing about Gladwell so far \u2013 he's arguing against a position that almost nobody has taken. \n \n Most people are arguing that, like the telephone or email, services like Twitter can be quick and effective communication tools. Even Gladwell acknowledges that. In a Q&A with New Yorker readers, Gladwell said: \"In combination with grass roots work, [Twitter] can be a very useful tool.\" \n \n So what's the problem, then? Once again this sounds like a journalist from traditional media trying to make a new tool fit an old paradigm and complaining when it doesn't. Citizen journalism won't replace professional journalism, tweeting won't replace activism, home cooking won't replace restaurants, dogs won't replace cats. Why is all this so hard to grasp? \n \n Gladwell has form in this area, sadly. In 2006 he was demonstrating his inability to grasp blogging. \"Without the New York Times,\" he said, \"what would there be for bloggers to blog about.\" I said at the time he was wrong but at least he was a few years ahead of Andrew Marr. \n \n In dismissing Twitter in 2010, Gladwell is right on schedule.

After the company proposed the new logo on its website on October 4, the internet lit up with snotty comments about the new look. \"It reminds me of the old Microsoft Free Clip-art galleries,\" one Facebook user wrote. \"I can't believe this is happening.\" \n \n Another wrote: \"It totally looks like a powerpoint design!\" \n \n The company responded with a Facebook post of its own on Monday. \n \n \"OK. We've heard loud and clear that you don't like the new logo,\" the company said. \"We've learned a lot from the feedback. We only want what's best for the brand and our customers.\" \n \n More than 1,700 people clicked that they \"liked\" that decision. \n \n \"Yay! I don't know why it matters, but it does,\" one Facebook user wrote in response to that post. \n \n Another Facebook user wrote: \"bit of an embarrassing 180 [degree turn], but at least you had the guts to face up to it, well done.\" \n \n After the logo complaints started rolling in, Gap on October 6 said it would \"crowdsource\" the design of its brand, meaning it would take alternate suggestions from fans and might decide to use one of them. \n \n But on Monday the company said that idea didn't work either. \n \n \"We've learned a lot in this process,\" the company said in a press release. \"And we are clear that we did not go about this in the right way. We recognize that we missed the opportunity to engage with the online community. This wasn't the right project at the right time for crowdsourcing.\" \n \n A Gap spokeswoman did not immediately respond to CNN's requests for comment. \n \n The back-and-forth has spawned several joke websites. \n \n One, called Crap Logo Yourself, lets people create their own icons in the style of the now-dead Gap logo. \n \n And two Twitter accounts were born from the snafu. \n \n @NewGapLogo has been responding to complaints. \n \n \"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder,\" said an October 7 post on that Twitter feed. \n \n Another, @OldGapLogo, had been calling for a return to the old logo. On Tuesday, however, that account posted what appeared to be a final tweet: \n \n \"Well...looks like my work here is done. Peace. I'm out,\" it said. \n \n Plenty of news sites and blogs took their stabs at the new logo, too. \n \n Vanity Fair even wrote an obituary for it: \n \n \"The new Gap logo is survived by its antagonistic Twitter feed and a dozen 'failed branding strategies' slide shows, in which it will be archived in the annals of history,\" the magazine wrote. \"To heaven, the Helvetica now ascends.\" \n \n This obviously isn't the first time a company has backed off of a branding change. The blog The Stir has a nice roundup of marketing history's biggest blunders, including the New Coke experiment. \n \n For more information about why Gap says it changed the logo in the first place, see this article by Marka Hansen, president of Gap North America, on the Huffington Post. \n \n \"We want our customers to take notice of Gap and see what it stands for today,\" Hansen wrote on October 7. \"We chose this design as it's more contemporary and current. It honors our heritage through the blue box while still taking it forward.\" \n \n Well, at least until they changed it back again.",

Trump's speech is being closely watched to see if he softens proposals to deport millions of people living in the United States illegally. \n \n Kaine says Trump's words and actions have been \"frightening\" to Hispanics and he doesn't expect to hear a change in tone. And he says its \"hard to say\" what to expect out of Trump's meeting Wednesday with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto. \n \n ___ \n \n 1:05 p.m. \n \n Hillary Clinton is blasting Donald Trump for referring to the American military as \"a disaster.\" \n \n Clinton says in a sharply worded speech Wednesday to the American Legion convention that it's \"an insult to the men and women serving today and all who have served before.\" \n \n The Democratic presidential nominee is reiterating that she would send American troops into harm's way only as a \"last resort,\" calling it a bedrock principal. \n \n She also says the last thing the nation needs is a president \"who brings more name-calling and temper tantrums to Washington,\" a reference to her Republican opponent. \n \n ___ \n \n 1 p.m. \n \n Hillary Clinton is tweaking rival Donald Trump's decision to travel to Mexico, saying it takes more to make up for a \"year of insults and insinuations\" than a quick trip to America's southern neighbor. \n \n Clinton says at the American Legion's annual convention in Ohio that voters need to know that they can count on you.

She says the U.S. is an indispensable nation and has a \"unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress.\" \n \n Referencing Trump's threats to \"walk away from our alliances,\" she notes that when America fails to lead, the country leaves a vacuum for the rest of the world to fill. \n \n ___ \n \n 11:25 a.m. \n \n Just days after Hillary Clinton criticized the Trump campaign for promoting groups and individuals associated with preserving \"white identity,\" Donald Trump Jr. has retweeted an adherent of the \"alt-right\" movement that Clinton singled out for criticism. \n \n Donald Trump's oldest son this week retweeted a post from Kevin MacDonald, a former professor at California State University Long Beach. MacDonald said last week that white people in America are becoming a victimized minority. He has been accused of anti-Semitism by critics, including the Southern Poverty Law Center. \n \n MacDonald's tweet had to do with Clinton's State Department and perceived favoritism for UBS, a global financial services company that donated to the Clinton Foundation. \n \n Trump Jr.'s retweet prompted Richard Spencer, a leader of the alt-right movement, to tweet \"Wow. Just wow.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 9:50 a.m. \n \n Mike Pence says that Donald Trump's trip to Mexico demonstrates what a \"decisive leader\" he would be if elected president. \n \n Trump's running mate told Fox News Wednesday that Trump immediately responded to an invitation by Mexico's President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto to meet. He noted that Hillary Clinton received the same invitation but hasn't responded yet. \n \n Pence said that Trump and Pena Nieto are expected to discuss the logistics of Trump's proposed border wall \u2014 something Trump insists Mexico will pay for, despite Pena Nieto's condemnation of the plan. \n \n ___ \n \n 9:35 a.m. \n \n At least two demonstrations are planned in Mexico City as Mexicans express anger about the visit of Donald Trump. \n \n Former first lady Margarita Zavala wrote in a tweet aimed at Trump: \"Even though you may have been invited, we want you to know you're not welcome.

Trump is widely loathed in Mexico for calling migrants from the country \"rapists\" among other insults. \n \n Mexico City-based security analyst Alejandro Hope suggested that Pena Nieto \"wanted to invite Hillary (Clinton), but that meant inviting both of them, and nobody thought Trump would accept first.\" \n \n He added: \"What's in it for Mexico? \" \n \n The newspaper El Universal wrote in an editorial that Trump \"caught Mexican diplomats off guard\" by accepting the invitation. \n \n ___ \n \n 3:10 a.m. \n \n Donald Trump will be taking his first foreign trip as the Republican presidential nominee on Wednesday, making a quick visit to Mexico, a nation he derided as the home of rapists and criminals as he launched his campaign. \n \n The meeting with President Enrique Pena Nieto, who earlier this year compared the billionaire candidate to Hitler, comes hours before Trump is set to deliver a highly-anticipated immigration speech. It's a defining issue for Trump, but one on which he has appeared to waiver. \n \n After saying during his primary campaign he would expel all of the estimated 11 million people living in the country illegally with a \"deportation force,\" Trump has suggested recently he might be open to \"softening\" his stance as he tries to win over more moderate general election voters. ||||| GOP nominee Donald Trump waxed diplomatic during a joint news conference with Mexico's President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto in Mexico City on Wednesday afternoon. \n \n \"We had a very substantive, direct, and constructive exchange of ideas over quite a period of time,\" Trump said. The U.S. and Mexico \"are united by our support of democracy, a great love for our people and the contributions of millions of Mexican-Americans to the United States. And I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican-Americans.\" \n \n Whether genuine or not, Trump on Wednesday diverged heavily from his hard-line primary rhetoric \u2014 about deporting 11 million illegal immigrants \u2014 and laid out a five-point plan for a hemispheric approach to U.S. relations with Mexico. \n \n Trump called illegal immigration \u2014 from Central and South America to the U.S. \u2014 a \"humanitarian disaster\" for \"the extreme physical dangers\" that the \"trek\" poses. \n \n \"Having a secure border is a sovereign right and mutually beneficial,\" he argued before alluding to his proposed wall along the southern border of the United States: \"We recognize and respect the right of either country to build a physical barrier or wall on any of its borders to stop the illegal movement of people, drugs and weapons.\" \n \n As for his previous promises to supporters that the Mexican government would for whatever reason pay for said wall, Trump said, \"We didn't discuss that.\" ||||| Trump gets what he wanted in Mexico The Republican nominee gets his presidential moment south of the border. \n \n Donald Trump could barely have scripted it better. After a year of tormenting Mexico as a hostile foe, he stepped to a podium on Mexican soil \u2014 alongside the country\u2019s leader Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u2014 and got a president\u2019s welcome. \n \n Trump emerged from an hourlong huddle with Pe\u00f1a Nieto and the pair delivered side-by-side statements, embedding subtle criticisms of each other inside enthusiastic declarations of mutual respect. But it was the precise visual Trump had hoped for: a bilateral news conference that amounted to a preview of what similar international trips might look like in a Trump presidency. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n In written remarks \u2014 delivered in stilted bursts \u2014 Trump clung tightly to his arguments that the North America Free Trade Agreement had benefited Mexico disproportionately to the United States\u2019 detriment. He described a mutual agreement with Pe\u00f1a Nieto about each country\u2019s right to build a border wall. Pe\u00f1a Nieto even contended that Trump\u2019s hot-blooded rhetoric about Mexicans has been, in some cases, \u201cmisinterpretations.\u201d \n \n Yet the most striking development may have been Trump\u2019s decision to simply ignore the central policy proposal of his campaign: forcing Mexico to pay for the 2,000-mile wall. Trump, responding to a reporter\u2019s question, said financing for the wall simply didn\u2019t come up in the conversation with Pe\u00f1a Nieto, that the talks were \u201cpreliminary\u201d and could be continued later. (Pe\u00f1a Nieto later disputed that on Twitter, writing, \"At the start of the conversation with Donald Trump I made it clear Mexico will not pay for the wall.\") \n \n But it was a striking departure from his campaign-trail posture; so synonymous with the Trump candidacy is the wall proposal that adoring fans chant \u201cMexico!\u201d at rallies when he asks who will fund his plan. \n \n In a speech he plans to deliver later Wednesday in Phoenix, Trump is expected to detail his immigration policy, which has suddenly become a moving target despite forming the core of his candidacy for the past year. Along with a Mexico-financed wall, he\u2019s long pledged mass deportations of undocumented immigrants. \n \n A campaign spokesman reiterated as recently as Tuesday that Trump still intends to force Mexico to pay for the wall. Sean Spicer, a Republican National Committee spokesman, added that he doesn\u2019t expect Trump's speech to include much of a departure from his previously stated policies. \n \n \u201cI don't want to get ahead of the speech, but he's made it very clear that everyone who is not in the country legally must leave the country so I don't expect to see any kind of departure from that,\u201d he said on CNN Wednesday afternoon. \n \n Pe\u00f1a Nieto, squeezed by political leaders in his own country, strained to deliver subtle rejections of Trump\u2019s language while maintaining his pledge to be impartial in the American election. He delivered a methodical dismantling of Trump\u2019s anti-NAFTA arguments, noting that trade with Mexico supports as many as 6 million American jobs. He also reminded Trump that for all the undocumented immigrants and drugs flowing north, illegal cash and weapons are flowing south. \n \n \u201cThis is a point of view of border issues that\u2019s clearly incomplete because it doesn\u2019t consider the illegal flux of weapons and cash that come into the South,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery year millions of weapons and millions of dollars cross illegally into Mexico from the North that strengthen cartels and other criminal organizations that generate violence in Mexico and receives earnings from drug sales in the United States. This flow has to be stopped.\u201d \n \n Illegal immigration to the United States had slowed since its peak a decade ago, he added. And he referred obliquely to Trump\u2019s disparagement of undocumented immigrants from Mexico as rapists or criminals. \n \n \u201cPeople of Mexican heritage in the U.S. contribute every day with their work, talent, and creativity, to the prosperity and development of the U.S. and Mexico. Mexicans living in the U.S. are honest and hardworking people \u2014 they are people of goodwill, who respect family, who respect living in community, and who respect the law,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why Mexicans deserve everyone's respect.\u201d \n \n Later, Pe\u00f1a Nieto lamented that there\u2019s been \u201cmisinterpretations and statements that have unfortunately hurt and affected Mexicans in the way he's presented his candidacy,\u201d but he added that \u201cI was sure that his genuine interest was to build a relationship.\u201d \n \n Trump, who delivered his statement second, embraced Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s language, referring to the \u201cdeep and sincere\u201d bond between America and Mexico and referred frequently to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and even \u201cour hemisphere\u201d when describing his posture toward Mexico, a far cry from the \u201cAmerica First\u201d language that typically threads his speeches at home. \n \n Republicans largely greeted Trump\u2019s visit as a success, primarily because he\u2019d set a low bar and managed to exceed it. \n \n \u201c[Hillary] Clinton's framework is that Trump would embarrass the country abroad. He didn't,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a Republican operative and former adviser to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cThis Mexico trip worked for Trump in the short term.\u201d \n \n Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s predecessors were less diplomatic about their president\u2019s decision to host Trump. Vicente Fox said the visit simply legitimized Trump\u2019s earlier harsh rhetoric. After the speech, Felipe Calderon called Trump a \u201chypocrite\u201d for changing his tone. \n \n \u201cI don't believe him. He is lying. He doesn't mean what he says,\u201d Calderon said on CNN. \u201cHe says we're rapists and tomorrow he says we're wonderful, smart, hardworking people. He is lying. And for that reason, I think, I was very, very sorry, I'm very sorry he came to Mexico. I think it was a very important mistake.\" \n \n Democrats and even Trump\u2019s detractors among Republicans argue that it\u2019s too late for him to persuade large numbers of Hispanic voters to support his candidacy. Rather, they viewed his trip as a chance to frame his immigration speech and also to convince undecided white voters with concerns about his temperament that he can be trusted with international affairs. \n \n Whether the speech turns out to be a watershed in the campaign or a too-little-too-late desperation play is unclear. \n \n But with a firm handshake, and a declaration that Pe\u00f1a Nieto is a \u201cfriend,\u201d Trump strode out of the presidential palace in Mexico City assured that, for a moment, he exceeded international expectations. And then he boarded his plane to Phoenix. \n \n Bianca Padro Ocasio and Tyler Pager contributed to this report. ||||| \"My job is to protect Mexicans wherever they are, and I will continue to do that,\" Pe\u00f1a Nieto told Trump, the two men standing at lecterns on a stage with one flag, Mexico's. \"Mexicans who live in the U.S. contribute to prosperity there.... They are people who are honest and hardworking. They respect the law ... and deserve the respect of everyone.\" ||||| Mexico President Enrique Pena Nieto and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump shake hands after a joint statement at Los Pinos, the presidential official residence, in Mexico City, Wednesday, Aug.... (Associated Press) \n \n MEXICO CITY (AP) \u2014 Standing alongside the president of Mexico, a measured Donald Trump on Wednesday firmly defended the right of the United States to build a massive border wall along its southern flank but declined to repeat his frequent promise to force Mexico to pay for it. \n \n Trump, the U.S. presidential candidate who is widely despised across Mexico, also sidestepped his repeated criticism of Mexican immigrants following a closed-door meeting at the official residence of the country's president, Enrique Pena Nieto. Trump and Pena Nieto, who has compared the New York billionaire to Adolf Hitler, addressed reporters from adjacent podiums flanked by a Mexican flag. \n \n \"We did discuss the wall. We didn't discuss payment of the wall,\" Trump said. \n \n In his announcement of his presidential candidacy last year, Trump derided Mexico as a source of rapists and criminals coming to the U.S., and his presence on Wednesday sparked anger and protests across the capital city. A former Mexican president bluntly told the celebrity businessman that, despite Pena Nieto's hospitality, he was not welcome. \n \n \"We don't like him. We don't want him. We reject his visit,\" former President Vicente Fox told CNN, calling the trip a \"political stunt.\" \n \n Pena Nieto was less combative as he addressed reporters alongside Trump. He acknowledged the two men had differences, but he described their conversation as \"open and constructive.\" They shook hands as the session ended. \n \n The trip, a politically risky move for Trump 10 weeks before America's presidential Election Day, came just hours before the Republican nominee was to deliver a highly anticipated speech in Arizona about illegal immigration. That has been a defining issue of Trump's presidential campaign, but also one on which he's appeared to waver in recent days. \n \n After saying during his Republican primary campaign he would use a \"deportation force\" to expel all of the estimated 11 million people living in the United States illegally, Trump suggested last week he could soften that stance. But he still says he plans to build a huge wall \u2014 paid for by Mexico \u2014 along the two nations' border. He is under pressure to clarify just where he stands in a speech that's been rescheduled several times as he and his staff has sent varied and conflicting messages on the issue. \n \n \"The American people are going to see more clearly that there's one candidate in this race who's prepared to take the steps necessary to end the flood of illegal immigration,\" Trump's running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, said Wednesday on CNN. \n \n Trump will also make clear, Pence later told CBS, \"that there will be no path to legalization, no path to citizenship. People will need to leave the country to be able to obtain legal status or obtain citizenship.\" \n \n The buildup to the speech was abruptly interrupted Tuesday night by the news that Trump would visit Mexico, accepting on short notice an invitation offered last week by Pena Nieto. The newspaper El Universal wrote in an editorial that Trump \"caught Mexican diplomats off guard.\" \n \n Campaigning in Ohio earlier in the day, Democrat Hillary Clinton jabbed at Trump's Mexican appearance as she promoted her own experience working with foreign leaders as the nation's chief diplomat. \n \n \"People have to get to know that they can count on you, that you won't say one thing one day and something totally different the next,\" she told the American Legion in Cincinnati. \"And it certainly takes more than trying to make up for a year of insults and insinuations by dropping in on our neighbors for a few hours and then flying home again.\" \n \n He has promised, if elected, to deport millions of immigrants who are in the United States illegally, force Mexico to build a wall to secure the nearly 2,000-mile border and renegotiate the NAFTA trade agreement to make it more favorable to the United States. \n \n Pena Nieto made his invitation to both Trump and Clinton, who met with him in Mexico in 2014. The inclusion of Trump puzzled many in Mexico, who said it wasn't clear why their own unpopular president would agree to meet with someone so widely disliked in his country. \n \n Mexico City-based security analyst Alejandro Hope suggested that Pena Nieto \"wanted to invite Hillary, but that meant inviting both of them, and nobody thought Trump would accept first.\" \n \n Pena Nieto has been sharply critical of Trump's immigration policies, particularly the Republican's plans to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. In a March interview, he said that \"there is no scenario\" under which Mexico would do so and compared Trump's language to that of dictators Hitler and Benito Mussolini. \n \n Trump responded to Vicente Fox's criticism on Twitter earlier in the day, saying the former president had, like Pena Nieto, invited him to come. Fox shot back with a tweet of his own, saying he had invited Trump to \"come and apologize to all Mexicans. Stop lying! Mexico is not yours to play with, show some respect.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Peoples reported from Washington. AP writer Jill Colvin in Phoenix contributed to this report.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 In a situation that was unthinkable just 24 hours ago, Donald Trump and Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto gave a joint press conference Wednesday in Mexico City following an hour-long meeting between the two, reports the Los Angeles Times, which calls Trump's jaunt to Mexico both \"hastily arranged\" and \"stunning.\" \"We did discuss the wall,\" the AP quotes Trump as saying, answering the question on everyone's mind. But: \"We didn't discuss payment of the wall.\" But ABC News reports Pe\u00f1a Nieto later took to Twitter, claiming he did in fact tell Trump Mexico wouldn't pay for the wall, essentially calling the candidate a liar. During the news conference, Trump maintained it was America's right to build a wall, Pe\u00f1a Nieto says any talk of border security needs to include stopping the flow of money and guns into Mexico, according to Politico. In addition to not addressing his long-made claim that Mexico would pay for the wall, Trump also softened his rhetoric on Mexican immigrants. \"I happen to have a tremendous feeling for Mexican-Americans,\" Salon quotes Trump as saying. And Pe\u00f1a Nieto insisted that all Mexican nationals living in the US \"deserve the respect of everyone.\" Trump ended his speech by calling Pe\u00f1a Nieto, a man who once compared him to Hitler, a \"friend.\" Pe\u00f1a Nieto characterized his discussion with Trump as \"open and constructive.\" He says he believes Trump really does want to help Mexico via his policies, the AP reports.

    "document": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Federal Reserve took no new steps to support the economy Wednesday, but it said in a statement that it was ready to act if job growth did not improve. \n \n The statement, released after a meeting of the Fed\u2019s policy-making committee, said that the rate of economic growth had slowed in recent months and was likely to remain \u201cmoderate over coming quarters.\u201d As a result, the Fed said it expected the unemployment rate to decline \u201conly slowly.\u201d \n \n But the central bank deferred any effort to improve the situation at least until the committee\u2019s next scheduled meeting in mid-September. \n \n \u201cThe committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability,\u201d it said. \n \n That was stronger language than it used after its previous meeting in June, when it said that it was \u201cprepared\u201d to act. \n \n And the Fed\u2019s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said that the Fed is \u201ccommitted to ensuring, or at least doing all we can to ensure\u201d that unemployment continues to decline, suggesting officials may simply be waiting to see the government\u2019s estimates of job growth in July and August, which will be released before the committee reconvenes Sept. 12 and 13. \n \n The absence of action appeared to disappoint some equity investors. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell 4 points, or 0.29 percent, Wednesday, to 1,375.32. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped sharply after the Fed\u2019s announcement, and then traded erratically before closing near its session low. It fell 37.62 points, also 0.29 percent, to 12,971.06. \n \n But much of the market\u2019s attention already has turned to the September meeting, when the Fed also will update its economic projections. \n \n \u201cThis statement will at least raise some new doubts about whether the Fed will be easing again this year,\u201d Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. \u201cWe still expect they will, assuming that growth remains fairly sluggish, but for now at least the statement keeps the debate open.\u201d \n \n Mr. Bernanke will have an opportunity to clarify his views when he speaks at an annual monetary policy conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., at the end of August. \n \n Some Fed officials suggested recently that the weak rate of growth required new action. They said that the unemployment rate had stagnated above 8 percent since January, and that the most recent economic forecasts by Fed officials, published in June, projected the rate would decline slightly, if at all, during the second half of the year. \n \n But there were no votes for action at the meeting that ended Wednesday. Among the 12 officials who vote on monetary policy, the only dissent from the decision to stand pat came from an official who has consistently pressed for the Fed to do less, Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. \n \n The Fed already is engaged in a wide-ranging effort to spur growth by cutting interest rates, punishing savers and rewarding borrowers. The central bank has held its benchmark rate near zero since late 2008, and said that it planned to maintain that policy at least until late 2014. It has put further pressure on long-term rates by amassing a portfolio of almost $3 trillion in long-term Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. And it said in June that it would keep buying bonds through the end of the year. \n \n But those efforts have proved insufficient to set off a strong recovery. The economy has slogged along somewhere between crisis and prosperity for more than three years now. Unemployment remains pervasive; more than 23 million Americans cannot find full-time jobs. And the Fed, while insisting that it could do more, has so far declined to prove it. \n \n Some Fed officials remain uncertain that the economy needs help. Economic indicators are imprecise, particularly in times of turbulence. Some officials also doubt the Fed can help. Cheap loans are at best an indirect means of addressing problems like the decline in government spending, tight credit standards and high levels of household debt. \n \n Vincent Reinhart, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley, said that the Fed appeared \u201cresigned to subpar economic performance\u201d because it lacked confidence in the available tools. \u201cIf it were more confident, it would have done more,\u201d said Mr. Reinhart, who worked as the Fed\u2019s chief monetary policy staff member under Mr. Bernanke. ||||| WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) \u2014 A cautious Federal Reserve on Wednesday said that the economy was weaker but took no new action to help stimulate demand. \n \n The lack of any policy action was a surprise. Analysts had expected the Fed to at least push out its pledge to hold its benchmark federal funds rate exceptionally low. Instead, the Fed repeated that it would likely hold that rate steady until late 2014. Read text of FOMC decision. \n \n Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke \n \n Many economists had thought that the Fed might announce a major new asset-purchase plan. \n \n U.S. stocks SPX, -1.13% dropped in the immediate aftermath of the Fed decision. \n \n Joe LaVorgna, chief economist at Deutsche Bank, welcomed the Fed\u2019s inaction. \u201cThe training wheels need to come off the bike and the economy needs to be left alone,\u201d he said. \n \n As expected, the Fed left unchanged the federal funds rate target at zero to 0.25%, the level it has been at since December 2008. \n \n The central bank downgraded its view on the economy, saying that economic activity had decelerated. Previously, the Fed had said that the economy had been expanding moderately. \n \n Since the recession officially ended in the summer of 2009, the economy has sputtered along with the unemployment rate stuck above 8%. \n \n The Fed did leave the door open for action. \n \n The FOMC promised to \u201cclosely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments\u201d and said it \u201cwill provide additional accommodation as needed.\u201d \n \n This is a slightly stronger promise that in June, when it said that it was \u201cprepared to take action as appropriate.\u201d \n \n Ward McCarthy, chief financial economist at Jefferies, said the Fed is \u201cready to pull the trigger\u201d if the bar of sustained improvement in the labor market is not met or if downside risks intensify. \n \n But Jim O\u2019Sullivan, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, said the statement raised doubt about whether the Fed will be easing again this year. \u201cWe still expect they will, assuming growth remains fairly sluggish, but for now at least the statement keeps the debate open,\u201d he wrote in a note. \n \n Bernanke will discuss policy options in his annual speech at the Fed\u2019s Jackson Hole retreat on Aug. 31. \n \n Many economists are convinced the Fed will launch a new asset-purchase program, including the buying of mortgage-backed securities, at its next policy meeting in September. \n \n But others are not so sure that more purchases, or quantitative easing, is inevitable. \n \n Expectations too high for Fed, ECB? (3:55) In the context of Mario Draghi's \"whatever it takes\" comment, are hopes set unattainably high for the Fed and ECB? Spencer Jakab discusses on Markets Hub. (Photo: Reuters) \n \n The Fed will have two more unemployment reports, including one on Friday, before its next meeting. Officials want to gauge whether growth will likely remain moderate and pick up gradually as forecast or if the recent soft patch is becoming something more severe. \n \n The FOMC vote on Wednesday was 11 to 1. The dissenter was Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, who has dissented at every meeting this year. \n \n Lacker wanted the Fed to omit any guidance on how long rates will stay exceptionally low. \n \n Last month, the Fed extended its Operation Twist program until the end of the year. The Fed is selling short-term government securities and buying longer-term Treasurys in a bid to lower long-term interest rates. \n \n John Lonski, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Capital, said there was no reason for additional stimulus at the meeting as equity markets have firms and credit spreads have been relatively well behaved. \u201cFinancial markets are not in need of additional support right now,\u201d he added. \n \n Lonski also said investors would be closely watching European Central Bank President Mario Draghi\u2019s press conference following the central bank\u2019s policy meeting Thursday. \n \n If Draghi follows though on his pledge to do whatever it takes to support the Europe, it will relieve pressure on the Fed to take additional action, he commented.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n Drinking coffee, tea or chocolate does not appear to cause heart palpitations, heart fluttering and other out-of-sync heartbeat patterns, researchers reported Tuesday. \n \n The report challenges a widely held belief that caffeinated drinks cause irregular heart rhythms that can lead to heart failure or dangerous heart rhythm disorders and is another vindication for coffee as a safe drink. \n \n It might be time for doctors to lighten up on coffee, says Dr. Gregory Marcus, a cardiologist at the University of California San Francisco, who led the study. \n \n \"Clinical recommendations advising against the regular consumption of caffeinated products to prevent disturbances of the heart's cardiac rhythm should be reconsidered, as we may unnecessarily be discouraging consumption of items like chocolate, coffee and tea that might actually have cardiovascular benefits,\" Marcus said in a statement. \n \n \"We may unnecessarily be discouraging consumption of items like chocolate, coffee and tea that might actually have cardiovascular benefits.\" \n \n \"Given our recent work demonstrating that extra heartbeats can be dangerous, this finding is especially relevant.\" \n \n It used to be believed that premature cardiac contractions, which usually cause no symptoms or mild symptoms such as heart palpitations, \u2018skipped\u2019 beats or fluttering, were harmless. But studies now show they\u2019re associated with heart failure, atrial fibrillation and other dangerous conditions. \n \n And doctors are widely taught that caffeine can cause these heart disturbances. \n \n To check, Marcus and colleagues examined 1,388 people, with an average age of 72, taking part in a larger heart study. \n \n About 60 percent said they drank some sort of caffeinated product every day. The team looked specifically at coffee, tea and chocolate and did not ask about super-caffeinated energy drinks. \n \n They measured instances of premature ventricular contractions and premature atrial contractions. \n \n They could not find any differences in instances of these heart disturbances, no matter how much coffee or tea or chocolate people had. \n \n \u201cTherefore, we are only able to conclude that in general, consuming caffeinated products every day is not associated with having increased ectopy or arrhythmia but cannot specify a particular amount per day,\u201d Marcus and colleagues wrote in the Journal of the American Heart Association. \n \n \"Habitual coffee drinkers have lower rates of coronary artery disease.\" \n \n They said it is possible that people who noticed heart flutters or other symptoms from coffee or tea may have cut back \u2013 they did not ask them. \n \n But they also noted that it\u2019s yet another finding in favor of moderate coffee drinking. \n \n \u201cCoffee is among the most commonly consumed beverages in the United States and is the main source of caffeine intake among adults,\u201d they wrote. \n \n \u201cRegular coffee consumption has been associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors such as obesity and depression,\u201d they added. \n \n \u201cFurthermore, large observational studies have found that habitual coffee drinkers have lower rates of coronary artery disease and of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality.\u201d \n \n The cutoff seems to be around five cups a day, and kids shouldn't be drinking too much caffeine. \n \n Higher doses of caffeine can be deadly. The Food and Drug Administration has warned about sales of powdered caffeine, One teaspoon delivers as much caffeine as 28 cups of regular coffee. ||||| SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) \u2014 A new study indicates that regular caffeine consumption does not contribute to heart palpitations or extra heartbeats, according to UC San Francisco researchers. \n \n The results of the study, appearing in the January 2016 issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association, challenge the widely held clinical belief that caffeine products can lead to extra heartbeats. \n \n The study measured the consumption of caffeinated products over a 12-month period by nearly 1,400 randomly selected patients who were part of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Cardiovascular Health Study database of nearly 6,000 patients, though that sampling excluded individuals who persistently had extra heartbeats. The subjects were given a baseline food frequency assessment and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography monitoring with the frequency of regular consumption of coffee, tea or chocolate determined by a survey. \n \n \u201cClinical recommendations advising against the regular consumption of caffeinated products to prevent disturbances of the heart\u2019s cardiac rhythm should be reconsidered, as we may unnecessarily be discouraging consumption of items like chocolate, coffee and tea that might actually have cardiovascular benefits,\u201d said the study\u2019s senior author, UCSF Health cardiologist Gregory Marcus, MD, MAS. \u201cGiven our recent work demonstrating that extra heartbeats can be dangerous, this finding is especially relevant.\u201d \n \n Of the 1,388 subjects participating in the study, 840 or 61 percent consumed more than one caffeinated product daily. \n \n The researchers found no differences in the number of PACs (premature atrial contractions) or PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) per hour across levels of coffee, tea and chocolate consumption. More frequent consumption of these products was not associated with extra heartbeats. \n \n \u201cThis was the first community-based sample to look at the impact of caffeine on extra heartbeats, as previous studies looked at people with known arrhythmias,\u201d said lead author Shalini Dixit, a fourth-year medical student at UCSF. \u201cWhether acute consumption of these caffeinated products affects extra heartbeats requires further study.\u201d \n \n American Heart Association guidelines on the management of premature ventricular contractions state that if a patient\u2019s history is consistent with premature extra heartbeats, potential exacerbating factors such as the use of caffeine, alcohol and nicotine should be eliminated.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Add one more study to the \"coffee is good for you\" file. Contrary to the long-standing belief that caffeine may cause heart palpitations that can lead to heart failure, new research in the Journal of the American Heart Association suggests the claim is, well, rubbish. Researchers surveyed 1,388 people with an average age of 72 about their caffeine consumption, reports NBC News. Some 61% of participants said they consumed some amount of coffee, tea, or chocolate daily. After looking for premature ventricular and atrial contractions in the heart, scientists concluded there was no link between caffeine consumption and heart palpitations, heart fluttering, or other irregular heartbeat patterns, even among those who consumed a lot of caffeine each day. \"Clinical recommendations advising against the regular consumption of caffeinated products to prevent disturbances of the heart's cardiac rhythm should be reconsidered, as we may unnecessarily be discouraging consumption of items like chocolate, coffee, and tea that might actually have cardiovascular benefits,\" says the lead author of the study from the University of California-San Francisco. Current AHA guidelines suggest that a patient with extra heartbeats avoid caffeine, which can worsen the problem, notes CBS San Francisco. Because \"this was the first community-based sample to look at the impact of caffeine on extra heartbeats,\" the researchers say further study is needed, per the Mirror. (There's more good news if you drink three to five cups of coffee per day.)",

AP's earlier story is below. \n \n A fire on an empty Boeing 787 Dreamliner plane forced Heathrow Airport to temporarily close both its runways Friday. \n \n The incident comes as unwelcome news for Chicago-based Boeing Co., whose Dreamliners were cleared to fly again in April after a four-month grounding amid concerns about overheating lithium-ion batteries. \n \n Heathrow said there were no passengers aboard the Ethiopian Airlines plane, which was parked at a remote stand of the airport, and runways reopened after about an hour. British police said the fire is being treated as unexplained. \n \n Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel said in an email that the company had personnel on the ground at Heathrow and \"is working to fully understand and address\" the situation. \n \n Ethiopian Airlines was the first airline to resume using the 787, with a flight on April 27 from Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa to Nairobi, Kenya, after the battery incidents. \n \n The airline could not immediately be reached for comment. \n \n Television images showed nearly a dozen fire trucks on the scene at Heathrow and firefighters standing around the Ethiopian Airlines plane, which was parked on a remote stand. \n \n Fire-retardant foam appeared to have been sprayed, and it was not immediately clear if there was damage to the plane. \n \n The Dreamliner suffered battery incidents in January, including an emergency landing of one plane and a fire on another. U.S. federal authorities lifted the grounding order on April 19, and several airlines have recently resumed flying their Dreamliners. \n \n None of the incidents caused any serious injuries. But the January grounding embarrassed Boeing and disrupted schedules at the eight airlines that were flying the planes. The company had delivered 50 of the planes worldwide. \n \n Boeing never did figure out the root cause of the battery incidents. Instead, it redesigned the battery and its charger. The changes included more heat insulation between each cell and charging the battery to a lower maximum voltage. \n \n Shares in Boeing fell 6.5 percent to $99.58 on news of the Heathrow fire. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Raphael Satter in London and Scott Mayerowitz in New York contributed to this report.",

(Matthew Fortner/Staff) \n \n After a night of fear and grief in downtown Charleston, authorities in North Carolina arrested a young white man on charges that he gunned down nine people at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, ending a vast search but leaving the city and the nation reeling. \n \n Video To see a video of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney\u2019s opening prayer at the Charleston YWCA\u2019s April 24 \u201cRequiem on Racism 2015,\u201d go to https://vimeo.com/126710749 \n \n The Holy City struggled to comprehend why the gunman police identified as 21-year-old Dylann Storm Roof would sit down for an hour at a Bible study in the historic black church on Calhoun Street and then open fire, wiping out most of the clergy. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating the killings as a hate crime. \n \n The victims The nine people fatally shot at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church: Clementa Pinckney, 41, the primary pastor who also served as a state senator. Cynthia Hurd, 54, St. Andrews regional branch manager for the Charleston County Public Library system. Sharonda Coleman-Singleton, 45, a church pastor, speech therapist and coach of the girls\u2019 track and field team at Goose Creek High School. Tywanza Sanders, 26, who had a degree in business administration from Allen University, where Pinckney also attended. Ethel Lance, 70, a retired Gailliard Center employee who has worked recently as a church janitor. Susie Jackson, 87, Lance\u2019s cousin who was a longtime church member. DePayne Middleton-Doctor, 49, a retired director of the local Community Development Block Grant Program who joined the church in March as a pastor. Myra Thompson, 59, a pastor at the church. Daniel Simmons Sr., 74, a pastor, who died in a hospital operating room. \n \n To President Barack Obama, the shooting stirred up \u201ca dark part\u201d of American history when racially motivated violence was more prevalent. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch declared that such acts have \u201cno place in a civilized society.\u201d \n \n The emotional weight of the ordeal also brought local activists, Charleston\u2019s police chief and South Carolina\u2019s governor to tears as they fought to find words to ease community members who fear further violence in a city with a long and complicated history involving race. \n \n \u201cWe woke up today, and the heart and soul of South Carolina was broken,\u201d Gov. Nikki Haley said, her voice trembling. \u201cWe have some grieving to do. ... Parents are having to explain to their kids how they can go to church and feel safe. That\u2019s not something we ever thought we\u2019d deal with.\u201d \n \n After a massive manhunt, Roof, who has shown interest in racial segregation and the Confederacy, was caught during a traffic stop Thursday morning in Shelby, N.C., 250 miles north of Charleston. A motorist there recognized Roof\u2019s 15-year-old Hyundai from wanted posters distributed by police. \n \n A resident of Eastover, a rural town near Columbia, Roof smiled at television cameras Thursday afternoon as Shelby officers led him to a waiting cruiser, his mop of blond hair hanging in his eyes and a ballistic vest covering his torso. He waived extradition, and South Carolina flew him back to Charleston County to face charges in what has been called one of worst hate crimes the United States has seen in decades. \n \n Meanwhile, the community mourned and searched for answers, with hundreds packing prayer vigils in a show of solidarity and support for the fallen and the families they left behind. \n \n In all, six women and three men died after gunfire sprayed through Emanuel\u2019s basement. Among the dead were a state senator who served as the church\u2019s primary pastor, a beloved county librarian, a dedicated girl\u2019s track and field coach and a young college graduate. The victims ranged in age from 26 to 87. \n \n Their deaths marked the second fatal shooting in the past three months that has drawn the nation\u2019s eyes to the Charleston area, roiling racial tensions and prompting federal investigations. The FBI has been examining potential civil rights violations in the April 4 killing of Walter Scott, a black man shot in the back by a white North Charleston police officer. FBI agents also are looking into what motivated Wednesday\u2019s bloody attack in Emanuel AME Church, Columbia-based spokeswoman Denise Taiste confirmed. \n \n The tragedy also renewed politicians\u2019 focus on reform of the nation\u2019s gun laws. Obama said Thursday during a press briefing in Washington that the Charleston shooting should spark national introspection about the availability of guns. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve had to make statements like this too many times,\u201d Obama said. \u201cCommunities like this have had to endure tragedies like this too many times. Once again, innocent people were killed because someone who wanted to inflict harm had no trouble getting their hands on a gun.\u201d \n \n The shooting \n \n The tragedy unfolded on a hot, steamy night after about a dozen clergy and church members gathered for a regular Bible study and prayer service. They met in the basement, a ground-level floor beneath the sanctuary that housed the pastor\u2019s office and other rooms. \n \n They studied Mark 4 16:20. \u201cOthers, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy ...\u201d \n \n A young white man, not part of the congregation, came in around 8:15 p.m. and sat down quietly. He stayed for 40 to 50 minutes as the session continued. \n \n \u201cBut since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away ...\u201d \n \n Suddenly, the young man rose, uttered remarks that betrayed his contempt for blacks and opened fire with a gun. \n \n A female trustee, who hid under a table, was among the survivors. The gunman told her he would let her live so that she could tell the story of what happened. Two other survivors, including a young girl, played dead, church members said. \n \n The search \n \n The gunman slipped out of the church as dozens of police officers descended on the area armed with military-style rifles, teams of police dogs and helicopters that circled overhead. \n \n Area residents locked the doors and bolted their gates, fearful after news spread that a gunman was on the loose. Activists from local black communities expressed fear of being targeted next. \n \n James Johnson, South Carolina president of the National Action Network, stood in the middle of Calhoun Street, where city leaders had announced the death toll moments earlier Thursday morning, and cried. \n \n Johnson has spoken out for years about civil rights concerns in Charleston-area policing. He had recently joined Clementa Pinckney, the slain AME church pastor, for a summit about the Scott shooting in North Charleston. \n \n But Johnson had never coped with anything like this, he said, and he worried that it would discourage people from talking about racially charged problems. \n \n \u201cWe feel that we\u2019re not safe,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could do the same thing when we speak out against this injustice. We must be mindful.\u201d \n \n As Johnson and others grappled with such thoughts, the gunman, who had slipped out of Charleston, put distance between himself and the carnage he\u2019d left behind. \n \n Investigators soon broadened their hunt, deploying local and statewide police agencies and top agents from the FBI and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. They also circulated surveillance camera images of a young man with a bowl haircut who appeared to be the gunman they were looking for. A bulletin included pictures of the gunman\u2019s 2000 Hyundai Elantra and a telephone tip line for people to call if they saw the car or its driver. \n \n Tips started rolling in soon after the bulletin went out. By mid-morning, investigators named Roof as the suspected gunman and a call went out for his arrest. Shortly after 11 a.m., authorities announced he had been nabbed in North Carolina. \n \n \u201cWe had a number of tips that were coming in,\u201d Mullen, the police chief, later said. \u201cIt was amazing. Whenever we got a lead ... we sent out teams. It was a tremendous effort. ... I am so pleased that we were able to resolve this case quickly ... so that nobody else is harmed by this individual.\u201d \n \n A picture soon emerged of a troubled young high school dropout who had talked about blacks in racially inflammatory terms and had been arrested in recent months on drug and trespassing charges. \n \n He had been banned from a Columbia mall in February after employees of two stores alerted police that Roof, dressed in all black clothing, was asking odd questions about their operations and when workers left for the night, an incident report stated. He was arrested on a trespassing charge in April after returning to the mall, records show. \n \n Friends said something seemed to be bothering him, but he stayed out of trouble until he walked into Emanuel AME Church Wednesday night. \n \n The aftermath \n \n Obama and Vice President Joe Biden called Charleston Mayor Joe Riley on Thursday to relay their condolences. They praised the efforts to track down the suspect, Riley said. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful sign that we don\u2019t let these people get away with these dastardly deeds,\u201d he said. \n \n But further rattling people as they mourned the losses, someone called in bomb threats to another downtown AME church where residents and leaders had gathered for a vigil and to the office building where Charleston County\u2019s coroner announced the names of those who were slain. \n \n Emotions already were raw this week from the anniversary of another tragedy that also claimed nine lives. The shooting occurred on the eve of the eighth remembrance of the June 18, 2007, Sofa Super Store blaze in West Ashley that killed Charleston firefighters. \n \n County Coroner Rae Wooten said the anniversary made her team\u2019s response to the shooting more difficult. \n \n \u201cIt all came back,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was somewhat disbelief that we could ever face something that horrific again.\u201d \n \n But people from local leaders to the president expressed resolve to overcome the latest carnage. \n \n U.S. Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., called it \u201cabsolutely despicable\u201d for such violence to occur in a place where people come together to \u201claugh, love and rejoice in God\u2019s name.\u201d \n \n Obama said Emanuel AME and its congregation have risen before from flames, an earthquake and other dark times to give hope to Charleston, \u201cand with our prayers and love and buoyancy, it will rise now as a place of peace.\u201d \n \n \u201cActs like this have no place in our country and no place in a civilized society,\u201d Lynch, the attorney general, added during a Thursday morning news conference in Washington. \u201cI want everyone in Charleston and everyone who has been affected by this tragedy to know that we will do everything in our power to help heal this community and make it whole again.\u201d \n \n Christina Elmore, Glenn Smith, Robert Behre, Melissa Boughton, Tony Bartelme, Schuyler Kropf and Jennifer Berry Hawes contributed to this report. ||||| The Rev. Clementa Pinckney stands inside Emanuel AME Church shortly after he was named its new pastor in 2010. Pinckney also serves as a state senator. Staff/file \n \n Beyond the squad cars blocking roads and news trucks jamming downtown sidewalks, Emanuel AME Church sits a white sentry of faith in the heart of historic Charleston, roped off by police tape to all who are watching her. \n \n State Rep. Bakari Sellers stands in a dapper suit under sweltering heat before national TV cameras aimed at the historic church. He tries not to glance at his cell phone clock. \n \n The son of civil rights activist Cleveland Sellers, he wants to speak, to remind, to mourn with the nation. \n \n But the news crew is running late, and he needs to dash to a prayer vigil a few blocks away at Morris Brown AME, daughter church of \u201cMother Emanuel,\u201d as the devastated congregation affectionately is known. \n \n The historic Charleston congregation, founded in 1818, was the first African Methodist Episcopal church in the South. It remains the oldest. \n \n However, its story really begins closer to 1816 when Morris Brown, a free shoemaker and devout Christian, walked out of a white, segregated Methodist Church in Charleston, an AME Church website states. \n \n He formed Emanuel AME which, like other black churches, became defenders of freedom to worship \u2014 and became deeply interwoven with freedom to do so much else. \n \n One of its founding members was Denmark Vesey. \n \n Almost to this precise day 193 years ago, Vesey plotted a failed slave rebellion from the very church where so much blood spilled Wednesday as worshippers gathered to study God\u2019s word. \n \n Vesey\u2019s rebellion might have charted a new course in the lives of enslaved black residents, had someone not tipped off authorities. But someone did. And the 1822 plot was discovered, bringing harsh reprisals to the area\u2019s black residents. \n \n Vesey, a former slave but then a free carpenter, died with 34 others by the hangman\u2019s noose. Emanuel AME was burned and its members driven underground to worship for decades. All-black churches were outlawed. \n \n The ensuing investigation forced its pastor, the Rev. Morris Brown, to flee north to Philadelphia, the seat of the AME Church. The church was burned. \n \n Mother Emanuel went underground. But rose again. \n \n In 1865, at the close of the Civil War, the congregation adopted the name Emanuel. It means, \u201cGod with us.\u201d \n \n Despite what officials are calling a horrendous hate crime, enough has changed in the ensuing 150 years that the nation elected its first black president. Now he too is left to mourn. \n \n President and Mrs. Obama knew Rev. Clementa Pinckney, the church\u2019s pastor who is among the dead. \n \n \u201cEmanuel AME opened its doors to strangers who sought healing. It\u2019s risen before from flames, earthquakes and other dark times,\u201d President Obama said in a televised addressed to a shocked nation. \n \n Pinckney took the helm of Mother Emanuel in 2010. \n \n That year, he told a Post and Courier reporter, \u201cLoving God is never separate from loving our brothers and sisters. It\u2019s always the same.\u201d \n \n Reach Jennifer Hawes at 937-5563, follow her on Twitter at @JenBerryHawes or subscribe to her at facebook.com/jennifer.b.hawes. ||||| CHARLESTON, S.C.

The president of the Charleston NAACP tells the Post and Courier that a survivor says the gunman briefly sat down in the Emanuel AME Church before opening fire on a prayer meeting, but at a news conference this morning, Mullen said the shooter stuck around for almost an hour before the shooting began, the AP reports. Mullen also distributed a surveillance video of a possible suspect and vehicle, and added that the victims were six females and three males. The NAACP chief says the gunman told one woman he was letting her live so she could tell others what happened. \"It is unfathomable that somebody in today's society would walk into a church when people are having a prayer meeting and take their lives,\" Mullen told reporters. \"I can assure you that we're going to do everything in our power to find this individual, to lock him up and to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone else.\" Mayor Joe Riley called the suspect \"one hateful person,\" describing the shooting as \"the most dastardly act that one could possibly imagine.\" In other developments: Helicopters are circling Charleston in the search for the suspect, who's described as a white male, around 21 years old, slender, clean-shaven, and wearing a gray sweatshirt, blue jeans, and Timberland boots, the Guardian reports. Police say he is \"obviously extremely dangerous.\" State Sen. Clementa Pinckney, the church's pastor, was in the church at the time of the attack, and State House Minority leader Todd Rutherford tells the AP that the lawmaker was among those killed.

He touched everybody.\" The Post and Courier has more on the history of the church, which it calls the \"spiritual home to one of the oldest and largest black congregations south of Baltimore,\" and which many in the city call \"Mother Emanuel.\" Its roots go back to 1816, and it was burned after one of its founders tried to organize a slave revolt in 1822.

(Associated Press) \n \n United States' Ashton Eaton listens to the U.S. national anthem after being presented with a gold medal in the men's decathlon during the athletics in the Olympic Stadium at the 2012 Summer Olympics,... (Associated Press) \n \n Heading into the final weekend of competition, the U.S. leads both the gold and overall medals races after trailing the Chinese most of the games. \n \n The Americans pulled further ahead Friday. At the end of the day's events, the U.S. led China 94 to 81 in total medals and 41 to 37 in golds. \n \n Bill Mallon, a veteran American medals prognosticator, believes the U.S. will win the overall race by 12 to 15 medals and the gold count by three to five. \n \n Four more golds would equal the highest U.S. total on foreign territory in Olympic history _ 45 at both the 1968 Mexico City Games and the 1924 Paris Games. \n \n The gold haul in London is already the best for the United States since it won 44 in 1996 in Atlanta. Its highest gold count was 83 at the 1984 Los Angeles Games, which were boycotted by the Soviet Union. \n \n The late U.S. charge in London has been spurred by the track and field team, with 26 medals, including eight golds, through Friday. \n \n The Americans picked up four medals Thursday night with 1-2 finishes by Ashton Eaton and Trey Hardee in the decathlon and by Christian Taylor and Will Claye in the triple jump. They grabbed two more Friday night _ gold in the women's 4x100-meter relay and silver in the men's 4x400 relay. \n \n Away from the track, wrestler Jordan Burroughs won gold in the men's 74-kilogram freestyle. \n \n The success could validate the projection of 30 medals by USA Track & Field, the national governing body for the sport, which had been widely maligned as too ambitious. \n \n With two more relays and a few other chances coming up, the United States could exceed 30 medals _ even after being shut out in the men's 200 and 400 meters, two events where the Americans usually excel. \n \n \"A lot of people thought 30 medals was crazy,\" said Steve Roush, the U.S. Olympic Committee's former chief of sports performance, who served on USA Track & Field's \"Project 30\" panel. \n \n He added: \"It was the big question mark coming in. It turns out we are going to be right there. If there is a surprise, it's just how well the U.S. has done in track and field.\" \n \n Though closely tracked by Olympic teams, fans and the media, the medals race is an unofficial competition. The International Olympic Committee doesn't even recognize the medal count. \n \n The U.S. Olympic Committee has also been reluctant to talk up the medals chase _ until the end of the games, anyway. It stresses that its job is to enable as many Americans as possible to stand on the podium and represent the country. \n \n \"We are fortunate to have had success in both team and individual sports,\" spokesman Patrick Sandusky said. \"The Olympic Games is a competition between athletes, not nations. With that said, we are very proud of our American athletes in London.\" \n \n China beat the U.S. in gold medals, 51 to 36, on home soil at the 2008 Beijing Games, while the Americans prevailed 110 to 100 overall. \n \n Many thought China would sweep both lists in London. And the Chinese started strong, racking up medals in their traditional sports of badminton, table tennis and diving. But medal chances are drying up in the final days, and China can't compete with the U.S. in track and field. \n \n \"China's big challenge is in swimming and track and field,\" Roush said. \"There are so many medals at stake.\" \n \n This is still China's best gold medal showing outside Beijing, better than the 32 it collected at the 2004 Athens Games. But there is a clear sense of disappointment back home. \n \n The Communist Party's official Guangming Daily newspaper complained of unfair judging. Several papers cited the result in the men's gymnastics rings event, in which Chen Yibing settled for silver behind Brazil's Arthur Zanetti. \n \n \"We need to shout out loud: London Olympics, under the Olympic rings, please view all participants equally,\" the paper said. \n \n In interviews with Chinese newspapers, the country's deputy sports minister, Cai Zhenhua, has also accused judges of discriminating against Chinese athletes. \n \n \"We need to solve the problem now or risk more judges adopting a biased view,\" Cai said. \n \n Britain, meanwhile, is assured of finishing third in gold medals, benefiting from a home-country boost that has produced its best medal performance in more than a century _ 25 golds and 57 overall. \n \n Not since the 1908 London Olympics has Britain racked up medals at this pace. Back then, only 22 nations showed up, compared with 204 today. \n \n Britain, heavily promoting its athletes as Team GB, has excelled particularly in rowing and track cycling, thanks in large part to generous funding from the national lottery and the government-backed U.K. Sport body. U.K. Sport allocated $470 million for sports federations and athletes ahead of the London Games. \n \n \"GB cycling is a model of what can be done, and the rowing is phenomenal,\" Roush said. \"It's been a combination of home-field advantage and U.K. Sport support.\" \n \n Britain's rise has come at the expense of once-powerful Russia, which will finish out of the top three in golds for the first time since before the Soviet Union began competing at the Olympics. \n \n In 1912, the Russian team had no golds and five total. The Soviet Union began competing at the 1952 Helsinki Games. Since then, the Soviet or Russian team has finished in the top three in golds every time _ until now. \n \n The Russians had only 15 golds through Friday, compared with 23 in Beijing. They have won plenty of silver and bronze and are third in the overall count with 62, but that's not good enough for a country that will host the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. \n \n \"The Russians are rebuilding,\" Roush said. \"The old Soviet system produced such strong talent and coaches, but the coaches and athletes are starting to retire.\" \n \n Perhaps the biggest surprise has been South Korea. The country of 50 million people _ roughly the population of California, Washington and Oregon put together _ has charged into fourth place with 13 golds, asserting itself as an Asian power. \n \n The South Koreans have invested heavily in Olympic sports, coaches and training and will do even more as they prepare to host the 2018 Winter Games in the city of Pyeongchang. \n \n Japan has performed strongly, with 35 medals, but has failed to turn them into gold, picking up only five. \n \n Australia and Germany have been among the biggest disappointments. The Australians had hoped to finish in the top five in both golds and total medals, but are lagging that pace with only seven and 31. Germany, which had a target of 28 golds and 86 medals, has only 10 golds and 42 total. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Christopher Bodeen in Beijing contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Stephen Wilson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/stevewilsonap. ||||| The United States continued its surge up the Olympic medal rankings Friday with a record-breaking victory in the women's 4x100-meter relay. \n \n Ethiopia's Meseret Defar holds up a picture to her face after she won gold in the women's 5000-meter final during the athletics in the Olympic Stadium at the 2012 Summer Olympics, London, Friday, Aug....

Teammates Tianna Madison, 200-meter champion Allyson Felix and Bianca Knight gave the U.S. a big lead heading into the anchor leg by 100 silver medalist Jeter. \n \n \"I was already pointing at the clock, saying 'there it is!'\" Jeter said after the race. \"There was a cloud hanging over us with people saying 'they cannot do this, they are going to drop the stick,' but we did it.\" \n \n Heading into the final weekend of the London Games, the U.S. tops both the gold and overall medals races after trailing the Chinese for most of it. \n \n It was yet another remarkable night in the main Olympic stadium as double amputee Oscar Pistorius of South Africa ran his last race of these Olympics in the men's 4x400-meter final. The U.S. just missed that gold, however, which went to the Bahamas. Pistorius _ the first amputee runner in track and field to compete at the Olympics _ received the South African baton in last place and was last crossing the line. \n \n The man known as \"Blade Runner\" because of his prosthetic carbon fiber blades came close to not running at all Friday after a Kenyan runner on Thursday knocked over South Africa's Ofentse Mogawane on the final bend in the second leg of the race. \n \n But the judges later ruled that the Kenyan runner had cut across Mogawane, causing the collision, and advanced the South African team to the final anyway. \n \n In other track finals, an Olympic record was set as France's Renaud Lavillenie won the pole vault gold medal with a games mark of 5.97 meters. \n \n In the women's 5,000 meters, Meseret Defar beat fellow Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba to win the gold.

European champion Alptekin, who served a two-year suspension for doping after the 2004 world junior championships, won the gold medal in 4 minutes, 10.23 seconds. \n \n Russia's Tatyana Lysenko earned a gold in women's hammer throw. \n \n Away from the track, the Netherlands had a 2-0 win over world champion Argentina to hold on to their women's Olympic field hockey title. In the bronze medal match, Britain won its first women's field hockey medal in 20 years with a 3-1 victory over New Zealand. \n \n Earlier Friday, Mathew Belcher and Malcolm Page of Australia held off their British rivals to win the men's 470 class, the country's third on the English Channel at Weymouth, ensuring that the Australians will finish with more sailing golds than Britain. \n \n \"I suppose I am an old man now,\" the 40-year-old Page said. \"I have been campaigning in 470s for 15 years. To go out like this is incredible.\" \n \n Sailing is just about the only place where Australia is excelling, particularly over the host country. After surprisingly winning just one gold medal in the swimming pool _ in a women's relay _ the games were an early disappointment for a team hoping to finish in the top five in the gold medal race. \n \n They won't achieve that, but gold medals to 100-meter hurdler Sally Pearson and cyclist Anna Meares, along with the triple gold performance from its sailors in the past five days have taken some of the sting out of what has been an under-par games for Australia. \n \n Most depressingly for Australia, its seven gold medals overall have been dwarfed by the 25 _ and counting _ won by their traditional and often bitter sporting rivals from Britain. \n \n In a later race at Weymouth, Australia's trans-Tasman neighbor New Zealand won gold in the women's 470 class. Jo Aleh and Olivia Powrie clinched the Kiwis' second sailing medal and fourth overall. \n \n Maris Strombergs of Latvia won his second straight Olympic gold medal in BMX, taking the lead out of the starting gate and never relinquishing it. Strombergs won the inaugural competition at the Beijing Games, but has struggled with injuries the past of couple years. \n \n Carlos Mario Oquendo Zabala made it a good afternoon for Colombia with his bronze. His teammate Mariana Pajon _ the flag bearer for Colombia in the opening ceremony _ won gold in the women's race earlier in the day. \n \n Squel Stein of Brazil crashed heavily during the semifinals of the race and was carried off the course on a stretcher. \n \n At a murky Serpentine Lake in London's Hyde Park, Ous Mellouli showed his versatility in the water, winning the 10-kilometer open water race less than a week after taking bronze in the 1,500 in the Aquatic Centre pool, the first swimmer to achieve that feat at the same Olympics. \n \n It was the second gold of Mellouli's Olympic career, having won the 1,500 at the 2008 Beijing Games. \n \n He overcame shoulder and elbow injuries before the games, plus a virus two days ago. Now, he's considering retirement. \n \n \"Only those close to me know how much I struggled to get here today,\" Mellouli said. \"I don't think there's a better way to go out than this. I can just leave it all behind and have no regrets.\" \n \n Russia won the synchronized swimming team final, giving the country its fourth consecutive gold medal in the event.

Just last week, the Pentagon sought to tamp down reports that Bilden might pull out. \n \n Bilden was an intelligence officer in the Army Reserve from 1986-1996.

    "document": "A paradox of the new music industry: Albums sell less and less well every year, but as a marketing tool they are now more important than ever. \n \n A case in point is Lady Gaga, whose new album, \u201cBorn This Way\u201d (Interscope), was released on May 23 and sold 1,108,000 copies in the United States in its first week, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Some 662,000 of those sales, or about 60 percent, were digital downloads, the most any album has ever sold in a week. \n \n The extraordinary success of \u201cBorn This Way\u201d \u2014 it outsold the next 42 albums on Billboard\u2019s chart combined \u2014 are a testimony to Lady Gaga\u2019s appeal and the hard work of her business team, which devised one of the most extensive and savvy marketing campaigns ever mounted in music. \n \n Once an artist\u2019s biggest source of income, recorded music now plays second fiddle to touring, endorsements, merchandise sales and an array of other revenue streams once considered ancillary. That\u2019s especially true for an artist like Lady Gaga, who has lined up more branding and promotional deals in the last six months than most artists will in a lifetime. \n \n \u201cPeople lose sight of how an artist becomes successful in 2011,\u201d said Bill Werde, Billboard\u2019s editorial director. \u201cShe could have sold 600,000 albums, or a million, or two million. But in terms of revenue that\u2019s going to be a smaller piece of the pie.\u201d \n \n If there is any asterisk on her achievement, it\u2019s that about two-thirds of the digital downloads are owed to a 99-cent deal offered by Amazon, which helped sales pass the million mark. The huge discount drew an angry reaction from brick-and-mortar retailers who saw their sales drop in response. \n \n Ish Cuebas, vice president for music merchandising of Trans World Entertainment, which operates 460 music and media stores, including F.Y.E., said that his shops sold about half as many copies of \u201cBorn This Way\u201d as he had expected. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think it sends a good message,\u201d Mr. Cuebas said of Amazon\u2019s deal. \u201cI can understand what Amazon did, but I think it devalues music even further. In the customer\u2019s mind it\u2019s worth 99 cents.\u201d \n \n But something is still needed to organize the flurry of products, activities and side deals that now constitute an artist\u2019s business, and most often that role is filled by an album, no matter what the cost. The album still establishes an artist\u2019s sound, look and message and provides an anchor around which long promotions can be built, from early singles (and leaks) to concert tours and television appearances. \n \n Recognizing this, Interscope and Lady Gaga\u2019s manager, Troy Carter, built their campaign around the release date, which they chose late last year to take advantage of music-related high points on the television calendar, like the Grammy Awards in February (where Lady Gaga played the premiere of her song \u201cBorn This Way\u201d) and the finale of \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d last week (where she sang her latest single, \u201cThe Edge of Glory\u201d). \n \n \u201cWe wanted to approach this like we were opening a blockbuster film,\u201d said Steve Berman, vice chairman of Interscope Geffen A&M.; \u201cIt became: \u2018We\u2019ll put a flag in that date well in advance. We won\u2019t move. And what we\u2019ll do for the next six months is pour gas on that fire every day, really branding the date.\u2019 \u201d \n \n Like any good movie campaign the selling of \u201cBorn This Way\u201d began nearly a year in advance and continued as a well-timed drumbeat of promotional appearances, retail tie-ins and media deals that rose to a climax as the release date approached. \n \n Lady Gaga announced the title of the album at MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards last September and gave the release date on New Year\u2019s Eve. As the promotions piled up in recent weeks, she became inescapable. If you missed her HBO concert special or \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d appearance, her GagaVille online game or fashion sale through Gilt Groupe, then perhaps you rode in one of the New York City subway cars decked out top to bottom with \u201cBorn This Way\u201d advertising. \n \n Lady Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, apparently knows the value of these deals. Mr. Carter said she accompanied him on numerous trips to retailers and to Silicon Valley start-ups eager to attach themselves to the Gaga brand. \n \n But the most effective offering may have been the one the Gaga team knew nothing about. On May 23 Amazon put the digital version of the album on sale for 99 cents to draw music fans to Cloud Drive, its entry into the world of so-called cloud music services, which store a user\u2019s songs on remote servers. \n \n Amazon paid Interscope\u2019s distributor, Universal, the full wholesale price for the album \u2014 between $8 and $9 \u2014 and accepted the difference as a loss, according to several people briefed on the sales arrangement, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the details. Billboard reported that Amazon\u2019s two-day sale yielded about 440,000 digital sales; if correct, that would mean that the retailer lost more than $3 million on the promotion. (Amazon declined to comment.) \n \n Several other new releases reached high on Billboard\u2019s album chart this week, but none came close to \u201cBorn This Way.\u201d Brad Paisley\u2019s new \u201cThis Is Country Music\u201d (Arista Nashville) is No. 2 with 153,000 copies sold, and \u201cGlee: The Music, Vol. 6\u201d (Columbia) sold 80,000, reaching No. 4. Adele\u2019s \u201c21\u201d (XL), which has been No. 1 for a total of nine weeks this year, fell two spots to No. 3 with 127,000. \n \n Mr. Carter, Lady Gaga\u2019s manager, said the prerelease promotional campaign for \u201cBorn This Way\u201d had been in full swing for six months. \u201cIf you look at \u2018The Fame,\u2019 \u201d Mr. Carter continued, referring to Lady Gaga\u2019s first album, \u201cit wasn\u2019t marketing ploys that drove the success of that album. It was the quality of the content and Gaga\u2019s willingness to go around the world and play for the fans, do the promotion, do the TV shows, visit the radio stations and the club D.J.\u2019s. There\u2019s a lot more of that than there are marketing ploys.\u201d \n \n That means the promotion for \u201cBorn This Way\u201d is far from over. \u201cThis is where the work begins,\u201d he said. ||||| After all that talk about underperforming singles and creative bankruptcy and overexposure, Lady Gaga did exactly what she was supposed to do with Born This Way, her first album since officially branding herself a superstar: sell a ridiculous number of units. The exact number, 1.1 million in the first week , is startling \u2014 but it comes with a caveat. That final tally was greatly boosted by the fact that Amazon, looking to drive people toward their new Cloud Drive music locker service, dropped the price on Born This Way\u2019s digital release to an all-new loss-leader low of 99 cents. Over the two days of the offer, the album was downloaded 440,000 times, roughly two thirds of its overall digital sales count. So how much did Amazon cough up in the process? \n \n According to the New York Times, Amazon paid Gaga\u2019s distributor, Universal, full price (between $8 or $9 per album), meaning they lost more than $3 million. That is certainly a ton of money to have kicked into your campaign by an entity that has no actual interest in how well your album sells, and it provides much fodder for anyone wishing to quibble with the validity of the 1.1 million number. But Lady Gaga should still get a lot of the credit: Amazon would have wanted to pull this kind of sales gimmick with someone, and, thanks to the all-permeating pop-culture presence that Gaga has cultivated, she was the top option. Meanwhile, Amazon chalks all those millions up to marketing costs and moves on. Win-win! Still, Taylor Swift \u2014 who only mustered a paltry 1.04 million sales for Speak Now\u2019s first week \u2014 is probably pretty salted.",

    "document": "Hispanic organizers are struggling to tamp down panic in their communities as federal authorities begin to implement President Trump's executive orders on immigration. \n \n One of the first cases to receive national attention, the deportation of Arizona resident Guadalupe Garcia de Rayos, has put undocumented and mixed status communities on edge. \n \n \"It's fair to say we\u2019re all extremely troubled by the deportation action we saw take place yesterday in Arizona,\" said Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza. \n \n \"The first deportation [after] his executive order is of a working mom with two U.S. kids,\" she added. \n \n On the campaign trail, Trump initially promised to enact a deportation force to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants, starting with dangerous criminals. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re going to be out of here so fast, your head will spin,\u201d Trump told Fox News in August. \u201cAs far as the rest, we\u2019re going to go through the process, like they are now \u2014 perhaps with a lot more energy.\u201d \n \n Trump softened his tone somewhat over the campaign, saying at the final presidential debate in October that he would prioritize the removal of \"bad hombres.\" \n \n And as president-elect, Trump said his government would seek out \"three or four million\" dangerous criminals immigrants for deportation. \n \n Many Hispanic advocates feel that the Garcia de Rayos case shows the Trump administration will aggressively pursue all undocumented immigrants. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n \"This reaffirms that when the Trump administration said they would go after criminals, they really meant everybody,\" Murguia said. \n \n The perception that Trump is shifting back to his early campaign proposals has shaken many Hispanics, including many who are legally in the country. \n \n \"The uncertainty and the confusion is prevalent with undocumented, legal residents and also citizens,\" said Telemundo anchorman Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart. \"There are millions of mixed status families in the United States of America.\" \n \n And community organizers admit they have few tools to quell the trepidation. \n \n NCLR is one of many organizations that has set up a legal defense structure and started programs to inform immigrants of their rights, but under current law, an undocumented immigrant who comes in contact with federal enforcement officers has relatively few options. \n \n \"We want people to stay calm and we want to give them assurances but we can\u2019t give them assurances,\" Murgu\u00eda said. \n \n Community organizations and media are focusing on keeping people informed of their options and the government's ability to persecute undocumented immigrants. \n \n \"What we are asking of the community is to get more plugged into community organizations,\" said Erika Andiola, political director of Our Revolution, a political action group spun off Sen. Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) SandersTentative deal reached to give Disney World workers an hour Sanders praises Dem move to limit role of superdelegates in picking nominee Democrats move to limit role of superdelegates in presidential nominations MORE's (I-Vt.) presidential campaign. \n \n \"[We're] providing know-your-rights training, things you can do to protect yourself if you have a house raid or work raid,\" Andiola said. \n \n Diaz-Balart, the anchor for Noticieros Telemundo, the network's nightly news program, is hosting a town hall event Sunday for his viewers to better understand the administration's immigration actions. \n \n \"[Immigrants are] now asking, 'how is this going to have an impact on me?'\" said Diaz-Balart. \n \n \"It\u2019s a town hall that is going to be dealing with the questions that we hear over and over and over again from the people that we serve,\" he said. \"It\u2019s not about telling people what they want to hear, it\u2019s about making sure the people are informed about things.\" \n \n Through his executive orders, Trump went after so-called \"sanctuary cities\" that restrict the degree to which their law enforcement agents collaborate with federal immigration enforcement. He has also redefined who could be labeled a \"criminal alien.\" \n \n That redefinition greatly expanded the number of undocumented immigrants liable to be targeted for removal, beyond the \"three or four million\" that Trump had mentioned. \n \n Jos\u00e9 Maga\u00f1a-Salgado, an attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, cited a study that said as many as 8 million people could now be targeted for deportation. \n \n Under Trump's order, the definition of criminality was expanded to include misdemeanors like illicitly crossing the border. \n \n It also expanded the definitions for immigrants to be considered priorities for deportation. Foreigners who have \"committed acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense\" are priorities, even before conviction. It also includes those who have committed \"fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with any official matter or application before a governmental agency,\" a category that includes using fake Social Security numbers to work. \n \n While Trump campaigned on the prospect of removing dangerous criminals, Maga\u00f1a-Salgado said the very structure of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) would provide an incentive for indiscriminate enforcement. \n \n \"The general philosophy of ICE agents and CBP agents, they view their job as expelling as many people from the country as possible,\" said Maga\u00f1a-Salgado. \n \n \"It benefits them to have high deportation numbers because they can justify their budget, they can justify their mission,\" he added. \n \n And cases like Garcia de Rayos provide an easy target for federal agents. \n \n Garcia de Rayos was apprehended during a yearly inspection at her local ICE headquarters, in which she voluntarily presented herself keeping with orders given to her when she was originally apprehended. \n \n As a low-risk offender \u2014 Garcia de Rayos was convicted of using a fake Social Security Number to work \u2014 she was not on the Obama administration's deportation priority list despite have been slated for deportation by an immigration judge. \n \n Beyond the detention of Garcia de Rayos, ICE conducted large raids this week on homes and workplaces that further alarmed Hispanic communities. \n \n Karen Tumlin, legal director of the National Immigration Law Center, said agents denied access to immigration lawyers after one such raid in Los Angeles that rounded up about 100 people. \n \n \"Immigration attorneys flocked to the scene,\" Tumlin said. \"They were shut out.\" \n \n \"[It's] absolutely unacceptable and potentially unlawful,\" she added. \n \n Similar cases to Garcia de Rayos could also attract the attention of federal enforcement officers because of the shortage of immigration judges to prosecute cases. People who have already been slated for deportation by a judge can be removed without further due process. \n \n The lack of immigration judges is \"certainly going to be a constraint,\" said Maga\u00f1a-Salgado. \n \n But agents can use expedited removal procedures, curbed under the Obama administration but not taken off the books, to get detainees to accept a quick deportation over a lengthy wait for an immigration judge, in many cases while incarcerated. \n \n \"They\u2019re going to use that tool to take people out of the court system and due process,\" Maga\u00f1a-Salgado said. \n \n Activists warn that going after easy targets can damage communities in several ways. \n \n People who would otherwise be economically active could go into hiding, trust in law enforcement agencies could be diminished, and dangerous criminals could more easily slip through the cracks as federal agents pursue non-dangerous undocumented immigrants. \n \n \"People want to comply with the enforcement agencies,\" Murguia said. \"They\u2019re supposed to report in with these check ins; if they see they\u2019re going to put themselves at risk, it\u2019s a very difficult situation.\" \n \n \"These are gut wrenching, heart-breaking stories,\" she added. \"In a civilized society, we can\u2019t find a better way to deal with these issues?\" \n \n The Telemundo town hall will air Sunday, Feb. 12 at 7 p.m. EST and will feature Alma Rosa Nieto, an immigration lawyer who will answer questions on specific cases. ||||| Immigration Raids Are Reported Around The Country \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption John Moore/Getty Images John Moore/Getty Images \n \n Federal immigration authorities launched a new wave of raids and other actions in several states over the past five days aimed at sweeping up people who are in this country illegally. \n \n It's not known how many people were rounded up across the country, but immigration advocates say they've received reports of raids in California, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, New York and Kansas. The ICE operations are the first to take place since President Trump issued his Jan. 26 executive order expanding the priorities for enforcement. \n \n President Trump has promised to deport 2 to 3 million immigrants with criminal records, but immigration experts say that while the Department of Homeland Security estimates there are 1.9 million \"removable criminal aliens\" in the United States, only about 690,000 are in this country illegally and have been convicted of a felony or serious misdemeanor. \n \n Preliminary reports from southern California give an indication of the scope of the ICE operations. An official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, in southern California, David Marin, called the actions routine \"surge operations\" that target \"priority cases,\" in other words, people in this country illegally who have criminal convictions. \n \n \"We made 161 arrests, and of those 161, 151 of those had prior criminal convictions. ... The majority of them were felons and those felons which had prior convictions included sex offenses, domestic violence, assault, robbery and weapons violations, just to name a few,\" said Marin in a press teleconference held late Friday. \n \n Marin said that of the ten others, five had impending deportation orders or had been deported and had illegally returned to the United States. The remaining five had no criminal records, but were in this country without documents. \n \n Immigrant advocates dispute officials' claims that the operations were routine. \n \n \"What they're trying to do is a really concerted effort to instill fear and terrorize our communities,\" said David Abud, an organizer with the National Day Labor Organizing Network based in Los Angeles told NPR. \n \n \"It's a way in which Trump and ICE are retaliating against sanctuary jurisdictions,\" he added. \n \n As we reported in the Two-Way, the majority of people in this country illegally are concentrated in 20 metropolitan areas in the country. \n \n The Washington Post quoted one immigration official who was not authorized to speak publicly because of the sensitive nature of the operation as saying, \"Big cities tend to have a lot of illegal immigrants. They're going to a target-rich environment.\" \n \n There were anecdotal reports of ICE staging traffic checkpoints and random sweeps of people suspected of being here illegally. ICE's Marin called those reports \"dangerous and irresponsible.\" \n \n Marin declined to discuss any connection between the raids and the president's recent executive order, except to say that the operations had been planned for weeks before that order was issued. ||||| U.S. immigration authorities arrested hundreds of undocumented immigrants in at least a half-dozen states this week in a series of raids that marked the first large-scale enforcement of President Trump\u2019s Jan. 25 order to crack down on the estimated 11 million immigrants living here illegally. \n \n Officials said the raids targeted known criminals, but they also netted some immigrants without criminal records, an apparent departure from similar enforcement waves during the Obama administration. Last month, Trump substantially broadened the scope of who the Department of Homeland Security can target to include those with minor offenses or no convictions at all. \n \n Trump has pledged to deport as many as 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records. \n \n Immigration officials confirmed that agents this week raided homes and workplaces in Atlanta, Chicago, New York, the Los Angeles area, North Carolina and South Carolina, netting hundreds of people. But Gillian Christensen, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), said they were part of \u201croutine\u201d immigration enforcement actions. ICE dislikes the term \u201craids,\u201d and prefers to say authorities are conducting \u201ctargeted enforcement actions,\u201d she said. \n \n (The Washington Post) \n \n Christensen said the raids, which began Monday and ended Friday at noon, found undocumented immigrants from a dozen Latin American countries. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about people who are threats to public safety or a threat to the integrity of the immigration system,\u201d she said, noting that the majority of those detained were serious criminals, including some who were convicted of murder and domestic violence. \n \n [For years, immigration authorities gave this Arizona mother a pass. Now she has been deported.] \n \n Immigration activists said the crackdown went beyond the six states DHS identified, and said they had also documented ICE raids of unusual intensity during the past two days in Florida, Kansas, Texas and Northern Virginia. \n \n That undocumented immigrants with no criminal records were arrested and could potentially be deported sent a shock wave through immigrant communities nationwide amid concerns that the U.S. government could start going after law-abiding people. \n \n \u201cThis is clearly the first wave of attacks under the Trump administration, and we know this isn\u2019t going to be the only one,\u201d Cristina Jimenez, executive director of United We Dream, an immigrant youth organization, said Friday during a conference call with immigration advocates. \n \n ICE agents in the Los Angeles area Thursday took a number of individuals into custody over the course of an hour, seizing them from their homes and on their way to work, activists said. \n \n David Marin, ICE\u2019s field director in the Los Angeles area, said in a conference call with reporters Friday that 75 percent of the approximately 160 people detained in the operation this week had felony convictions; the rest had misdemeanors or were in the United States illegally. Officials said Friday night that 37 of those detained in Los Angeles had been deported to Mexico. \n \n \u201cDangerous criminals who should be deported are being released into our communities,\u201d Marin said. \n \n Spanish language radio stations and the local NPR affiliate in Los Angeles have been running public service announcements regarding the hourly \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d seminars the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles scheduled for Friday and Saturday. By the time the 4 p.m. group began Friday, more than 100 others had gathered at the group\u2019s office in the Westlake neighborhood just outside downtown. \n \n A video that circulated on social media Friday appeared to show ICE agents in Texas detaining people in an Austin shopping center parking lot. Immigration advocates also reported roadway checkpoints, where ICE appeared to be targeting immigrants for random ID checks, in North Carolina and in Austin. ICE officials denied that authorities used checkpoints during the operations. \n \n [The \u2018sanctuary city\u2019 on the front line of the fight over Trump\u2019s immigration policy] \n \n \u201cI\u2019m getting lots of reports from my constituents about seeing ICE on the streets.

Joaquin Castro (D-Tex.) said he confirmed with ICE\u2019s San Antonio office that the agency \u201chas launched a targeted operation in South and Central Texas as part of Operation Cross Check.\u201d \n \n \u201cI am asking ICE to clarify whether these individuals are in fact dangerous, violent threats to our communities, and not people who are here peacefully raising families and contributing to our state,\u201d Castro said in a statement Friday night. \n \n Hiba Ghalib, an immigration lawyer in Atlanta, said the ICE detentions were causing \u201cmass confusion\u201d in the immigrant community. She said she had heard reports of ICE agents going door-to-door in one largely Hispanic neighborhood, asking people to present their papers. \n \n \u201cPeople are panicking,\u201d Ghalib said. \u201cPeople are really, really scared.\u201d \n \n Immigration officials acknowledged that as a result of Trump\u2019s executive order, authorities had cast a wider net than they would have last year. \n \n The Trump administration is facing several legal challenges to his executive orders on immigration. On Thursday, the administration lost a court battle over a separate executive order to temporarily ban entry into the United States by citizens of seven majority-Muslim countries, as well as by refugees. The administration said Friday that it is considering raising the case to the Supreme Court. \n \n [Federal appeals court rules 3 to 0 against Trump on travel ban] \n \n Some activists in Austin and Los Angeles suggested that the raids might be retaliation for those cities\u2019 \u201csanctuary city\u201d policies. A government aide familiar with the raids said it is possible that the predominantly daytime operations \u2014 a departure from the Obama administration\u2019s night raids \u2014 meant to \u201csend a message to the community that the Trump deportation force is in effect.\u201d \n \n Frank Sharry, executive director of America\u2019s Voice, an immigrant advocacy group, said that the wave of detentions harks back to the George W. Bush administration, when workplace raids to sweep up all undocumented workers were common. \n \n The Obama administration conducted a spate of raids and also pursued a more aggressive deportation policy than any previous president, sending more than 400,000 people back to their birth countries at the height of his deportations in 2012. The public outcry over the lengthy detentions and deportations of women, children and people with minor offenses led President Obama in his second term to prioritize convicted criminals for deportation. \n \n A DHS official confirmed that while immigration agents were targeting criminals, given the broader range defined by Trump\u2019s executive order, they also were sweeping up noncriminals in the vicinity who were found to be lacking documentation. It was unclear how many of the people detained would have been excluded under Obama\u2019s policy. \n \n Federal immigration officials, as well as activists, said that the majority of those detained were adult men, and that no children were taken into custody. \n \n \u201cBig cities tend to have a lot of illegal immigrants,\u201d said one immigration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly because of the sensitive nature of the operation. \u201cThey\u2019re going to a target-rich environment.\u201d \n \n Immigrant rights groups said that they were planning protests in response to the raids, including one Friday evening in Federal Plaza in New York City and a vigil in Los Angeles. \n \n \u201cWe cannot understate the level of panic and terror that is running through many immigrant communities,\u201d said Walter Barrientos of Make the Road New York in New York City, who spoke on a conference call with immigration advocates. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure that families who have been impacted are getting legal services as quickly as possible. We\u2019re trying to do some legal triage,\u201d said Bob Libal, the executive director of Grassroots Leadership, which provides assistance and advocacy work to immigrants in Austin. \u201cIt\u2019s chaotic,\u201d he said. The organization\u2019s hotline, he said, had been overwhelmed with calls. \n \n Jeanette Vizguerra, 35, a Mexican house cleaner whose permit to stay in the country expired this week, said Friday during the conference call that she was newly apprehensive about her scheduled meeting with ICE next week. \n \n Fearing deportation, Vizguerra, a Denver mother of four \u2014 including three who are U.S. citizens \u2014 said through an interpreter that she had called on activists and supporters to accompany her to the meeting. \n \n \u201cI know I need to mobilize my community, but I know my freedom is at risk here,\u201d Vizguerra said. \n \n Janell Ross in Los Angeles and Camille Pendley in Atlanta contributed to this report.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"People are panicking.\" That's the message from one immigration lawyer after hundreds of undocumented immigrants were rounded up this week by ICE agents in raids in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles, and the Carolinas, the Washington Post reports. According to NPR, the raids were the first since President Trump signed a Jan. 26 executive order on undocumented immigrants. That order redefined \"criminal alien,\" expanding the definition beyond the couple million \"bad hombres\" the president mentioned during the campaign to include undocumented immigrants who are only suspected of a crime or those who've committed low-level offenses, such as using a fake Social Security number to get a job, the Hill reports. All last week, homes and businesses were raided in broad daylight\u2014a change in tactic from the Obama administration that one government aide says is possibly meant to \"send a message\" under Trump. Immigrant advocates are also reporting that ICE agents are stopping immigrants at random or going door to door in minority-heavy neighborhoods to ask for IDs, though ICE denies these tactics. There have also reportedly been major raids in Kansas, Texas, Florida, and Virginia. Many advocates see this week as punishment for sanctuary cities and an attempt to \"instill fear\" in immigrants. And while officials maintain they're targeting undocumented immigrants with serious criminal records, advocates say it doesn't help their case that the first deportation under Trump was a \"working mom with two US kids.\"",

    "document": "The following article, which has provoked much criticism, should have included acknowledgment of the serious nature and number of allegations that had been made against the writer, Jian Ghomeshi. In October 2014, Ghomeshi\u2014about whom multiple women had filed harassment complaints\u2014was fired from the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation after executives saw evidence that he had caused physical harm to a woman. Shortly after, more than twenty women accused him of sexual abuse and harassment, which included hitting, biting, choking, and verbal abuse during sex. Many of these allegations were made in respected publications, including The Toronto Star. That November, Ghomeshi was charged with the sexual assault of three women. (Sexual assault, under Canada\u2019s Criminal Code, can include threats and nonconsensual physical contact. There is no specific legal provision for rape as it is defined in US law.) In January 2015, additional counts of sexual assault were brought against him by three more women. He was acquitted of all charges, and settled a further charge of sexual assault, of a coworker at the CBC, out of court with a peace bond and public apology. Substantial space will be devoted to letters responding to this article in the next issue of The New York Review, dated October 25, 2018. \n \n Not so long ago, I spoke to hundreds of thousands of listeners across North America every day on a public radio show. These days, the closest I come to public performance is at a neighborhood karaoke bar in New York. Even that can have its perils.

Hey, you know who ruined that name for you?\u201d \u201cNo. Who?\u201d I said, bracing myself. For the first time, she looked straight at me\u2014and stopped smiling. \n \n For her, it was like one of those excruciating moments when you accidentally include the butt of a joke in a reply-all e-mail. For me, it was just another day in the life of the notorious Jian. She apologized and said all the right things. And I said all the right things back. (\u201cHow could you have known?\u201d) Mostly I felt bad because she felt bad. But then we rallied and sang a duet together. And then we became friends and are regularly in touch.

The silence means Buruma has got his side of the story out first, portraying himself as a victim of social media bullying. \n \n New York Review of Books editor Ian Buruma departs amid outrage over essay Read more \n \n In an interview with the Dutch magazine Vrij Nederland, the writer and academic said he had been \u201cconvicted on Twitter, without any due process\u201d. He characterized his fate as \u201crather ironic\u201d. \n \n \u201cAs editor of the New York Review of Books I published a theme issue about #MeToo-offenders who had not been convicted in a court of law but by social media. And now I myself am publicly pilloried.\u201d \n \n The storm that toppled Buruma from one of the most prestigious journalistic seats in America erupted this month when he published a long article by the former Canadian broadcaster Jian Ghomeshi. The celebrity was acquitted in March, 2016, of sexual assault and choking relating to three women. \n \n At least a further 17 other women have also made serious allegations of improper sexual conduct against Ghomeshi. Yet in the essay, Ghomeshi tried to defend himself against the accusations, saying they were \u201cinaccurate\u201d. \n \n Ghomeshi said he wanted to give a more \u201cnuanced\u201d view of what had happened. \n \n The article prompted furious debate on social media and widespread criticism of Buruma\u2019s decision to publish on the grounds that, though Ghomeshi had been acquitted, he remained subject to multiple claims of violent behavior from many women. The dispute was aggravated when Buruma gave an interview last week to Slate in which he said it was not \u201creally my concern\u201d to take a view on Ghomeshi\u2019s allegedly violent behavior and argued that there were \u201cundesirable, or at least unresolved, aspects\u201d aspects to the way the Canadian star had been treated. \n \n Buruma commissioned the Ghomeshi article several months ago, and faced strong opposition to publication from members of the NYRB staff. The former editor-in-chief told Vrij Nederland: \u201cThe staff was initially not unanimously positive about publication, but once the decision to publish was made, we agreed. Also the publisher was initially positive.\u201d \n \n He insisted that he had not been fired from the NYRB job but had been put in a position where he felt he had to step down because of a combination of social media hounding and pressure from academic advertisers to the magazine who were not happy about the Ghomeshi scandal. \u201cUniversity publishers, whose advertisements make publication of the New York Review of Books partly possible, were threatening a boycott,\u201d Buruma said. \n \n \u201cThey are afraid of the reactions on the campuses, where this is an inflammatory topic.

Critics complained that the piece wasn't properly fact-checked and was self-serving to a man trying to rehabilitate his image. \n \n On Wednesday, the magazine added an editorial note clarifying several details about the allegations against Ghomeshi, how they emerged and the legal proceedings that followed. \n \n Buruma says he was not fired from the prestigious literary magazine, but felt forced to resign after he was told by his publisher that university publishers who advertise in the Review of Books were threatening a boycott. \n \n \"They are afraid of the reactions on the campuses, where this is an inflammatory topic,\" Buruma said to Vrij. \n \n \"Because of this, I feel forced to resign -- in fact it is a capitulation to social media and university presses.\" \n \n He admits he didn't gauge the forces of the .MeToo movement. \n \n \"I still stand behind my decision to publish,\" Buruma says now. \"I expected that there would (be) intense reactions, but I hoped that it would open a discussion about what to do with people who behaved badly, but who were acquitted in a court of law.\" \n \n Romayne Smith Fullerton, an associate professor in Western University's faculty of information and media studies, said it's the intransigence of those with influence like Buruma that has made her less and less optimistic about the potential for gender equality in journalism and beyond over her 22 years of teaching. \n \n \"It makes me feel like we haven't come very far,\" she said. \"I feel often like there's more push back. That there are less people who are willing to even stand up for equality, let alone what I would see as advancing the cause of women.\" \n \n Smith Fullerton said the magazine's lack of transparency about the events that transpired over the roughly weeklong controversy has sown distrust among readers. \n \n \"I would like to see the magazine step up, and acknowledge what they see as their own deficiencies,\" she said. \"One of the biggest and most valuable pieces of currency journalism has is credibility. If you're going to throw it under the bus, don't be sad when you don't have an audience.\" \n \n There is a place for journalism about the cultural forces that have enabled bad male behaviour, said Smith Fullerton, as well as the perspectives of men who have been accused, like Ghomeshi. But those accounts shouldn't come in the form of an unchallenged, first-person essay in a highbrow literary magazine, she said. \n \n \"Until we actually reach a spot where we are in fact equal, then we need to advocate on the side of those who are not equal,\" she said. \"And we do not yet have an equal workplace, a equal social sphere, or an equal public sphere.\" \n \n The New York Review of Books declined to comment. ||||| The Boy Crisis: Why Our Boys Are Struggling and What We Can Do About It by Warren Farrell and John Gray \n \n Healing from Hate: How Young Men Get Into\u2014and Out of\u2014Violent Extremism by Michael Kimmel \n \n White American Youth: My Descent into America\u2019s Most Violent Hate Movement\u2014and How I Got Out by Christian Picciolini",

[NYT] ||||| In a largely positive review of Jodi Kantor\u2019s book The Obamas in the New York Times Book Review, Douglas Brinkley\u2014a historian who has published books about several presidents\u2014wrote, \u201cCall it chick nonfiction, if you will; this book is not about politics, it\u2019s about marriage, or at least one marriage.\u201d \n \n Call it chick nonfiction? Some people most definitely won\u2019t. \n \n It\u2019s a little outside my ordinary purview\u2014though Kantor, a New York Times reporter, is Jewish\u2014but the line struck me as newsworthy, particularly given recent discussion accusing the Times Book Review of giving short shrift to woman authors. Here, that alleged lack of respect\u2014and to call a book \u201cchick nonfiction\u201d is to call it unserious\u2014extends not only to the woman who is the author but also to the woman who is the subject. The book documents the First Marriage, with an emphasis on the first lady and how she was able to influence White House policy. \u201cThe story of the book is of people who had equal power in a marriage and one giving up the power,\u201d said Rebecca Traister, a writer for Salon, in an interview with Tablet Magazine. And even less-positive reviewers\u2014including Brinkley\u2014acknowledge that no book about this marriage can be entirely free of political content. \n \n Jennifer Weiner, a novelist who prominently supported accusations in 2010 that coverage of Jonathan Franzen\u2019s novel Freedom reflected the Times\u2019, and arguably the publishing industry\u2019s, larger bias against woman writers, emailed this morning: \u201cMy suspicion is that if a male reporter had written a detailed, well-researched, revealing book about the First Marriage, it would have been praised as a serious work of journalism. However, when the old, pernicious double standards still apply, if it\u2019s a lady doing the investigation, the personal can never be political \u2026 it can only be gossip, and the writer, however skilled a reporter, is still merely a chick.\u201d \n \n Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein wrote, \u201cJodi Kantor\u2019s The Obamas is among the very best books on this White House. It\u2019s a serious, thoughtful book on the modern presidency in general. So no, I\u2019m not going to call it \u2018chick nonfiction.\u2019 \u201d \n \n Brinkley has not replied to a request for comment. \n \n While The Obamas\u2019 primary subject is the marriage itself, Kantor is a White House reporter for the Times, and the book broke several bits of news concerning Michelle Obama\u2019s frustration with a perceived failure to enact her husband\u2019s agenda\u2014particularly with regard to health care and immigration reform\u2014and her indirect conflict with Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and Press Secretary Robert Gibbs. \u201cEveryone from The Associated Press to POLITICO has focused their stories on the tensions involving Michelle Obama, Gibbs and Emanuel,\u201d reported Politico. \n \n Kantor declined to comment for this story, and Sam Tanenhaus, the editor of the Times Book Review, did not reply to a request for comment. As a sometime-contributor there, I would be surprised if the phrase \u201cchick nonfiction\u201d was not flagged by an editor or copy editor, which would mean (although this is only conjecture on my part) that it was then included at Brinkley\u2019s insistence. \n \n Many reviews have accused the book of various flaws. Though earlier on Kantor interviewed the First Couple, ultimately they did not cooperate with the book, and some have said this refusal significantly hindered what Kantor was able to reveal. Others have alleged errors of fact, although it turns out that many of the allegations were themselves erroneous. Many have said certain conceits, specifically a reconstructed scene featuring Michelle Obama alone, have gone a step too far into the speculative. \n \n But no review I\u2019ve read went quite so far in questioning the book\u2019s basic seriousness (even while elsewhere appearing to take the book very seriously). In addition to the \u201cchick nonfiction\u201d line, Brinkley refers to Kantor as \u201ca reportorial wunderkind\u201d who had \u201cgumption,\u201d implying that she is green. But Kantor\u2019s reputation as a wunderkind stems from her being named editor of the Times Arts section at the age of 27. Now, 36, she has been a Washington reporter since 2007, and, for example, wrote the paper\u2019s \u201cMan in the News\u201d profile of Obama on the eve of the 2008 convention. \n \n Traister noted that much of the review was positive, but in a way that makes the allegedly condescending tone of certain parts of it all the more puzzling\u2014and stark. For instance, Brinkley writes of Kantor, \u201cShe reconstructs a half-dozen or so strange, gossipy moments that hardly hold up as serious journalism, but provide insight nonetheless.\u201d Said Traister, \u201cIt\u2019s the crazy combination of being positive about the material in a professional, serious way, but then just assuming that we don\u2019t take it seriously.\u201d \n \n Weiner added, \u201cUsing a politician\u2019s personal life as the prism through which to view the choices he or she makes has always been the work of reporters and historians and even novelists. Yet I don\u2019t remember the Times calling Joe Klein\u2019s Primary Colors chick lit, or complaining that recent histories about politicians\u2019 personal lives, from Jon Meacham\u2019s Franklin and Winston to Jacob Weisberg\u2019s The Bush Tragedy to Robert Dallek\u2019s An Unfinished Life, took a tabloid tone.\u201d \n \n The difference isn\u2019t only that those books were by male authors. It\u2019s that this book is primarily about the president\u2019s wife. \n \n And not just any wife, as Traister eagerly pointed out. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about [Michelle Obama\u2019s] influence on [President Obama], you\u2019re talking about someone who began as his professional mentor, and was his professional equal,\u201d she said. \u201cThis was not true of any other First Lady until Hillary Clinton. You can\u2019t actually draw the historic comparisons without acknowledging that there\u2019s a radically different set of circumstances and context for, for example, her opinions on policy, since she and the president were professional and intellectual equals.\u201d Traister added, \u201c[Michelle Obama] comes at this with a completely different range of opinions, education, and experiences than what you\u2019re going to attribute to Jackie Kennedy or Lady Bird Johnson or Nancy Reagan\u201d\u2014three first ladies to whom Brinkley does compare Obama. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a critique that Jodi Kantor should have made that a more central theme in the book. But to not acknowledge the fundamental qualities that make it an entirely historic dynamic!\u201d \n \n Added Traister, \u201cThis is not to say someone had to give it a great review. But nothing I read about his review except for the implied femininity of author, subject matter, and lead character actually made it unserious. Because everything about how it was crafted and reported was positive.\u201d \n \n Indeed. Here are some good things Brinkley had to say: \u201cA few of the anecdotes Kantor includes are riveting;\u201d \u201cKantor skillfully elucidates;\u201d \u201cthe vivid prose stays, at all times, free of snark;\u201d and \u201cThe author is pretty much a straight-ahead reporter with an ear attuned to verifiable gossip.\u201d \n \n Yet in the same paragraph as that last sentence, Brinkley also writes, \u201cOn a couple of occasions, the tabloid scent in the book is so strong that one would be forgiven for thinking Kantor writes for Us Weekly, not The Times.\u201d \n \n The First Marriage [NYT Book Review]",

He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.\" \n \n What's next: Per the NYT, Comey has memos from all of his interactions with Trump. House Oversight Chair Jason Chaffetz has requested them from the FBI, and Democrats are claiming obstruction of justice. ||||| The controversy over President Donald Trump's abrupt firing of FBI Director James Comey has threatened to slow or even stall Republicans\u2019 policy agenda on Capitol Hill. Already facing Democratic opposition on some of their top priorities, Republicans insist the matter won't derail them but it's already proven to be a distraction at the very least. \n \n As the week began, Senate Republicans were focused on health care after the House narrowly passed its version of legislation to overhaul Obamacare. By Friday, health care, tax reform and other top GOP priorities had been shoved off the front-burner, at least momentarily, by the abrupt firing of Comey and new questions about the future of investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election. \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Trump under fire over 'tapes' threat as White House searches for new FBI director 3:03 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n Comey\u2019s ouster means that the Senate will have to confirm a new director to replace him, a process that has already shown signs of controversy as Democrats are demanding more answers about the timing of the firing and the FBI\u2019s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. \n \n A host of Democrats have said that they won\u2019t consider a new replacement to lead the FBI until a special counsel has been appointed to oversee that investigation, which Comey was leading. \n \n \u201cFrankly we should hold off on the FBI director until we get this special prosecutor,\u201d said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, indicating that he would try to slow down or block the confirmation of any FBI director. \n \n The bombshell that shook Washington this week has further strained a slow-moving Senate schedule that is void of any major legislative achievement. For the first months of this year, the upper chamber has been consumed with processing Trump's nominees \u2014 including the successful confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch \u2014 as well as GOP-backed Congressional Review Act measures to roll-back regulation from the Obama administration. \n \n The Senate has moved slowly, in part because of its rules, but also because Democrats have opposed the GOP's agenda. \n \n That's why one GOP senate aide sees little impact of the Comey firing. \u201cThe Democrats were already opposing everything all the time. Unless you are Spinal Tap you can\u2019t really turn the opposition volume from 10 to 11,\u201d the aide said. \n \n Senate Republicans began the Congressional year with a long to-do list, but it has been shrunk to accommodate the realities of governing in a partisan environment. They still, however, are working to pass a repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a reform of the tax system before the end of the fiscal year in September \u2014 two major pieces of legislation that don\u2019t need the support of Republicans because of a budget mechanism Republicans plan on using. \n \n Democrats say that go-it-alone approach increases the prospects of any gridlock that grips the Senate. \n \n \u201cI think we need to move ahead as much as possible to get things done for the American people. ... But trust is very, very difficult when the administration is trashing the oath of law,\u201d Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told reporters this week. \n \n Democrats successfully held up a days\u2019 worth of hearings on Capitol Hill Wednesday, the morning after Comey\u2019s firing, which is just one example of how they can slow down the process on Capitol Hill. \n \n Republicans insist that little has changed. A group of 13 senators have been plotting a way forward on health care, holding two meetings this week and the entire Republican conference spent much of their time on the subject at two lunches. \n \n For instance, they held their regularly scheduled lunch on Wednesday that lasted for nearly an hour-and-a-half, focused on health care. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said the caucus discussed Comey for maybe \u201c90 seconds\u201d on the topic. \n \n Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn, who is leading the health care talks, predicted the Comey matter won\u2019t detract from his work. \n \n \u201cI actually think that Republicans and Democrats will be looking for exactly the same thing: a very well-qualified FBI director of unimpeachable integrity who can lead the FBI and continue the investigation into what the Russians were doing in our election. I don\u2019t think it makes any difference for health care,\u201d Alexander said. \n \n Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed 'I'm Not Saying This Is Going to Be Easy:' GOP Battles on Health Care 8:26 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n But the reality is that the controversy has eaten into the rest of their work already.

Richard Burr, R-N.C., briefed his fellow Republicans on the conversation he had earlier in the day with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein who the Trump administration said recommended Comey\u2019s firing. \n \n Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V. and a member of the Intelligence Committee, said the Senate needs to move on to other business beyond Russia and Comey, but he noted that it is becoming more difficult. \n \n \u201cWe have to make sure we do a thorough job and leave no stone unturned\u2026 and go wherever the intelligence takes us,\u201d he says. \n \n While Senate rules and the calendar make sudden distractions like the Comey firing more damaging to their broader policy agenda, at least one Republican operative it could prove beneficial. \n \n \"It takes attention and fire away from an important policy effort,\" the operative said. \"Having the focus and the fury over a personnel matter could make the policy items a little easier because it dials down the attention and scrutiny from the hard left.\" \n \n Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, said he was confident his work on health care would not be impeded by Comey's ouster. \n \n He then struggled to fight his way past a mob of reporters blocking the elevators as they questioned his Democratic colleagues. \"Does anyone see the down button?\" he said.",

The story includes a quote from Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, who says that among his GOP colleagues, \"there is a lot less fear of him than there was just a month ago.\" Axios: It notes that Senate Republicans are going their own way on health care and the Russian investigation, and it predicts the same will happen on tax reform.

The dentist also was charged with tampering with evidence, he said. \n \n Patel, 45, who lives in Suffield, posted $25,000 bail and is scheduled to appear at Superior Court in Enfield on Feb. 24. \n \n Enfield detectives got involved in the case shortly after the death of Judith Gan, 64, of Ellington, at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield on Feb. 17, 2014 \u2014 exactly a year before Patel's arrest. \n \n \"We were investigating it all along,\" Sferrazza said. The warrant for Patel's arrest is sealed, the chief said. \n \n According to a four-count statement of administrative charges filed against Patel, with Gan in his office that day, the dentist failed to \"properly respond to J.G.'s oxygen desaturation and/or respiratory distress and/or cardiopulmonary distress\" while performing a full-mouth extraction. Records indicate that Patel intended to do 20 tooth extractions. \n \n Patel ignored the patient's deteriorating condition and did not respond when changes in her oxygen levels and vital signs were reported to him by the dental assistants, state Department of Public Health inspectors said in the charging statement. One assistant begged Patel to stop the procedure, the report says. \n \n In response to the criminal charges, Patel's attorney, Paul Knag, released a statement that said, \"After several months of deliberation, the state Dental Commission found that Dr. Patel's actions did not warrant the revocation of his license.

During the procedure, the low-oxygen alarm went off repeatedly and the patient was making gurgling sounds before she stopped breathing, the records state. \n \n \"The assistant begged [Patel] to stop working, and finally ran out and called 911, but the patient had already flat-lined,\" the inspectors reported. \n \n Patel's license was suspended on April 21. On Dec. 17, the dentist was told that he may never again treat a patient under sedation. He also must submit to five years of random monitoring. \n \n Knag has said in the past that the dentist's monitoring equipment wasn't working properly. He also said that his client did not violate any standard of care, and that expert witnesses called in Patel's defense during an administrative hearing testified that he was not negligent. \n \n This isn't the first time that Patel has been the subject of a health department investigation. \n \n On Dec. 19, 2013, while Patel was extracting another patient's teeth, the patient \"aspirated the throat pack,'' DPH inspectors reported. In that case, Patel failed to properly monitor the patient's response to conscious sedation, and failed to remove the throat pack in a timely way, the DPH records state. That patient began to choke, and was transported to Bay State Medical Center with \"grossly diminished breath sounds\" and a \"compromised airway.\" That patient survived, a DPH spokesman said. \n \n The other counts in the charging statement in Gan's case allege that on various occasions, Patel \"improperly delegated\" to a dental assistant or hygienist the induction of nitrous oxide or Midazolam to a patient, as well as the monitoring of a patient's response to conscious sedation. \n \n Inspectors also found at least five expired medications in his office, the state said. \n \n On Sept. 16, 2011, a Superior Court jury in Litchfield ruled in favor of another Patel patient who had sued him for malpractice after he severely damaged her mouth and teeth in a reconstructive procedure, according to the lawsuit.

Dr. Rashmi Patel was arrested Tuesday, Feb. 17, after turning himself into police. \n \n He's charged with criminally negligent homicide and tampering with evidence. \n \n In December, the state Dental Commission suspended his license pending a comprehensive review of his practice after finding he didn't properly care for two patients, including Judith Gan, 64, who died in February of 2014. The Dental Commission did not ultimately revoke his license. \n \n Here is a statement his lawyer released on his behalf: \n \n After several months of deliberation, the state Dental Commission found that Dr. Patel\u2019s actions did not warrant the revocation of his license. In the Dental Commission proceeding, multiple expert witnesses testified that Dr. Patel followed the standard of care. The state\u2019s seeking of criminal charges is contrary to this evidence and inconsistent with the decision of the Commission not to revoke his license. Dr. Patel disputes the charges and urges that the charges be dropped. \n \n Meanwhile, Gan's attorney, Richard Kenny, said the family is still taking in the arrest, which came exactly one year after Gan's death. \"He's doing okay. It's tough, very tough,\" said Kenny of Gan's husband. \"It was an emotional time to begin with.\" \n \n Kenny added that the Gan family is \"not vindictive\" and would like to see the criminal charges \"thoroughly evaluated.\" \n \n Police launched a criminal investigation into Patel shortly after Gan died. \n \n \"We were waiting for the medical examiner to come out with a manner of death and that took a little longer than usual,\" said Chief Carl Sferrazza of Enfield Police. \"When it finally came out, the detectives resumed their investigation.\" \n \n Patel's arrest warrant was approved not long after, though Sferrazza couldn't get into the details of how the autopsy relates to criminal charges. \n \n Kenny talked about how the findings could help a possible civil lawsuit against Patel: \n \n She had a number of conditions when she went in to see him and that's of course an issue into whether she should have been sedated in the first place, but what I was pleased to see is that Dr. Sexton [the medical expert who did the autopsy] in doing it, ruled out a lot of potential problems as causes of her death. Her preexisting things did not, did not suddenly occur and cause her to die. \n \n State officials say Patel violated care standards when treating 64-year-old Judith Gan of Ellington, who died after being placed under conscious sedation to have 20 teeth extracted at his Enfield office. Officials said Patel failed to respond appropriately when Gan\u2019s oxygen levels dropped and should not have planned so many procedures on her in one office visit. \n \n The state Dental Commission permanently banned Patel from performing conscious sedation and placed him on five years of probation. \n \n Kenny wonders if the tampering with evidence charge will entice the Commission to reopen its investigation and possibly revoke Patel's license for good. \n \n Patel is due in court to answer to his new criminal charges on Feb. 24 at 9 a.m. ||||| HARTFORD, Conn.

(Associated Press) \n \n Rashmi Patel turned himself in Tuesday at the Enfield Police Department and was charged with a misdemeanor count of criminally negligent homicide and a felony count of tampering with evidence, police said. Patel has offices in Enfield and Torrington. \n \n The charges came a year after Patel's patient Judith Gan died at a hospital on Feb. 17, 2014. State dental regulators concluded that Patel failed to adequately respond when Gan's oxygen levels dropped dangerously low as she was consciously sedated in the middle of the tooth extraction and implant procedures in his Enfield office that day. \n \n Patel, who posted $25,000 bail, has denied any wrongdoing in his treatment of Gan. \n \n \"Dr. Patel disputes the charges and urges that the charges be dropped,\" his attorney Paul Knag said in a statement Wednesday. \n \n Gan's death and other incidents prompted the State Dental Commission in December to suspend Patel's license pending a months-long review of his practice and permanently ban him from performing conscious sedation. \n \n But, Krag said, the commission did not revoke Patel's license. \n \n \"In the Dental Commission proceeding, multiple expert witnesses testified that Dr. Patel followed the standard of care,\" Krag said. \"The state's seeking of criminal charges is contrary to this evidence and inconsistent with the decision of the Commission not to revoke his license.\" \n \n The commission said in a report that Patel \"ignored\" signs that Gan, of Ellington, was in distress, including the drop in her oxygen saturation, changes in the color of her face and hands and wheezing and gurgling sounds. The commission said Patel, who lives in Suffield, also ignored warnings from his dental assistants that Gan was in danger and continued with the procedures. \n \n When one of Patel's assistants yelled that Gan was \"flat lining,\" Patel tried to revive Gan while the assistant called 911, according to the Dental Commission's report. Gan, 64, was rushed to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. \n \n The commission also found that Patel should not have attempted to perform so many procedures on Gan in one office visit given that her medical history included a heart attack six months before the visit, two strokes within the last two years and medication that could have affected her response to the sedation. \n \n Patel also violated care standards in December 2013 when another patient under conscious sedation to have teeth extracted inhaled a piece of gauze called a throat pack, which was designed to protect him from swallowing foreign objects, the commission found. The patient began flailing, his blood pressure spiked and he was rushed to a hospital but recovered. \n \n A lawyer for Gan's husband has said a lawsuit against Patel is planned. ||||| A dentist is accused of letting his patient die while extracting 20 teeth and inserting several implants. The patient showed signs of distress as she was under anesthesia for the dental procedures. \n \n The suspect, Rashmi Patel, a 45-year-old dentist, turned himself in on Tuesday, Feb. 17 at the Enfield Police Department. He is now facing charges of criminally negligent homicide and tampering with evidence. \n \n One year ago, a 64-year-old patient of his, Judith Gan, was declared dead at the hospital. It was Feb. 17 2014. According to dental state regulators, Dr. Patel failed to take action when his patient\u2019s oxygen levels dropped, hitting a dangerous level. She was consciously sedated and was undergoing several tooth extractions in order to be replaced by implants the same day. \n \n This event, along with other incidents convinced the State Dental Commission in December that it was necessary to suspend his license. This decision was taken after a careful, month-long analysis of his practice. \n \n Dr. Patel, who posted $25,000 bail said at first that he did nothing wrong during the treatment. \n \n According to the commission who filed a report, Patel \u201cignored\u201d the fact that his patient was showing signs of distress (the low oxygen level, her face and hands changing color, the wheezing and gurgling sounds she was making). \n \n The report also stated that the dentist ignored the situation and continued with the procedure even when his assistants prompted him that the patient was in a bad state.

She was also under medication that could have influenced the way she handled sedation. \n \n The attorney representing Gan\u2019s husband said that there will be a lawsuit against the dentist.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A woman who went to the dentist for a tooth extraction ended up dying after flat-lining in his chair, and now the Connecticut dentist has been charged with criminally negligent homicide in her death. Judith Gan, 64, went into Rashmi Patel's office on Feb. 17 of last year for a full-mouth extraction, during which 20 teeth would be removed and implants would be inserted. But during the procedure, Patel allegedly ignored the sedated woman's worsening condition\u2014even though the low-oxygen alarm went off multiple times, Gan started gurgling, wheezing, and changing color, and one of Patel's assistants \"begged\" him to stop working on her, inspectors say. The assistant finally called 911, but by then Gan had stopped breathing and \"flat-lined,\" according to a health inspectors' report. She was declared dead at a hospital; Patel has also been charged with evidence tampering. Gan had health problems, including a heart attack six months prior to her death and two strokes in the two years prior, the Monitor Daily reports; she was also on medication that could have interfered with sedation. \"That's of course an issue into whether she should have been sedated in the first place,\" the Gan family lawyer says, per Fox Connecticut. But, he adds, the medical examiner who performed the autopsy \"ruled out a lot of potential problems as causes of her death. Her pre-existing things did not ... suddenly occur and cause her to die.\" Officials also say Patel, 45, should not have planned so many procedures at once. The Dental Commission declined to revoke his license, but it did put him on five years of probation and banned him from performing sedation, the Hartford Courant reports. He has previously been accused of failing to monitor a sedated patient who choked on gauze but survived, the AP reports, as well as other problems. (A trip to the dentist may have saved this girl's life.)",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 A Connecticut dentist has been charged with criminally negligent homicide in the death of a patient who stopped breathing while in his care, the Hartford Courant reports. Dr. Rashmi Patel turned himself in Tuesday night after a warrant for his arrest was issued. The charges came a year after Patel's patient Judith Gan died at a hospital on Feb. 17, 2014. State dental regulators concluded that Patel, 45, failed to adequately respond when Gan's oxygen levels dropped dangerously low as she was in the middle of the tooth extraction and implant procedures in his Enfield office that day. Patel, who posted $25,000 bail, has denied any wrongdoing in his treatment of Gan. \"Dr. Patel disputes the charges and urges that the charges be dropped,\" his attorney said in a statement Wednesday. Gan's death and other incidents prompted the State Dental Commission in December to suspend Patel's license pending a months-long review of his practice.",

If you have been injured in the accident, make sure you receive medical treatment for your injuries as soon as possible. Seeing a medical professional is important to begin immediate treatment, as well as to document your injuries from an accident. Medical treatment and therapy may last much longer than you anticipate, so make sure that you preserve all medical records. Documents to preserve include: \n \n In some situations, facts in the police report may be admissible under Arizona Rules of Evidence Rule 803(8) , the public records exception to the hearsay rule. Reports made by government agents, such as police reports, are included in this exception. The full list of Arizona hearsay exceptions provides additional opportunities for evidence to be admitted. \n \n Not all out-of-court statements or assertions are considered hearsay. The statements of any parties to a case are admissible in Arizona personal injury cases, as is the case with all civil matters. The Federal Rules of Evidence, and the Arizona Rules of Evidence, outline various types of statements that are excluded by the Hearsay Rule, as well as exceptions to the Hearsay rule, and thus, may be heard and considered by a judge or jury. \n \n The reason these statements are usually inadmissible is because they are not made under oath, therefore, a judge or jury cannot personally observe the demeanor of the person making the statement. Additionally, the opposing party cannot cross-examine the person making the statement. If the statement is made out-of-court, a judge or jury does not have the ability to analyze the statement for ambiguity, insincerity, faulty perception or erroneous memory. \n \n A police report is usually inadmissible (not accepted as valid) in court because it is considered hearsay. The legal definition of hearsay is: \u201ca statement made out of court that is offered in court as evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d In other words, hearsay is any statement made outside the court that is offered in court to prove that the information in the statement is true. A statement may be considered written, oral or even a gesture. \n \n A police report may be used in your Phoenix personal injury settlement negotiations. If the police report indicates fault, it may be used as a settlement tool. The attorneys on the Lamber Goodnow team or their partner firms will corroborate and use information from the police report, as well as medical records, evidence of lost wages, explanations of loss of enjoyment and other important documents to draft a demand letter for the at-fault\u2019s insurance company, demanding damages in order to make our client whole. The demand letter would summarize the facts of the case, describe the injury, provide evidence of loss and demand compensation for injuries. \n \n Once a police report has been created you may obtain one by requesting it from the police department. If you know which law enforcement agency came to the scene of the accident and prepared the report (state highway patrol, county sheriff), you may call the police department and obtain the records. Depending on the jurisdiction, there are also online record request services. \n \n When the police arrive at the scene they will create a police report. The police report will usually be an important piece of evidence in determining the cause of the accident, even though it is often inadmissible in court. A police report will contain helpful information such as the date, weather conditions, time and location of the personal injury incident. It will also often contain the name, telephone numbers and statements of others involved in the accident, or any witnesses to the accident, which may prove invaluable when trying to prove fault. Additionally, the report will have the officer\u2019s initial assessment of fault. This will include the officer\u2019s written narrative of the details and causes of the accident, and usually includes a diagram. \n \n Under ARS \u00a7 28-666, the driver of a vehicle involved in an accident that results in injury to or death of a personal shall give notice immediately to either the local police department, county sheriff or nearest highway patrol. \n \n The Arizona Judicial Branch understands the importance of digital evidence; consequently, it has established the Task Force On Court Management of Digital Evidence by Administrative Order 2016-129 in order to develop policies for court management of digital evidence. \n \n In the digital age, the evidence preservation process has become important in civil litigation and personal injury cases. In the criminal arena, police would seize evidence, seal it in plastic bags, label it, and sign it in to a locked evidence room until its presentation at the trial. If the evidence were taken out for any reason, it would be noted in an evidence log. In the civil arena, however, evidence can be both electronic and physical. The stages of electronic discovery in civil litigation are: identification, preservation, collection, processing, review, analysis, production and presentation of evidence at a trial. Examples of non-electronic evidence in a personal injury case may include: photos of the accident scene, photos of vehicles, physical vehicle parts, natural contributors to an accident such as a tree branch, police reports, medical records and personal notes about the accident. \n \n Chain of custody refers to the paper trail, or chronological documentation, showing the seizure, custody, control, transfer and analysis of physical, or electronic evidence. The process is important to show that the evidence gathered is legally acceptable to courts and government agencies. It is important to be able to show that the evidence collected at an accident scene has not been altered, hidden, or destroyed, and that it accurately reflects the actual events that occurred. \n \n It is important to recover physical evidence immediately after an accident because, if it is not preserved or photographed in the first few days, it may get modified by time, the weather, lost, destroyed or repaired. It is also important that you work with an attorney to catalog its location once stored to ensure what\u2019s called the \u201cchain of custody\u201d and future admissibility. \n \n Physical evidence may be very helpful to show who was at fault in an accident. Some examples of physical evidence include: \n \n Although there are many different types of relevant evidence, some examples include: \n \n What to Do After an Accident The days immediately following an accident are often the most important for finding and preserving evidence of what occurred. It is vital that relevant evidence be gathered, identified and catalogued. Phoenix-based accident cases that go to trial typically end up being heard in Maricopa County Superior Court or Arizona Federal District Court . Both courts have complex rules of evidence that determine what a jury will ultimately hear. Although each piece of evidence must be looked at on its own, there are steps that can be taken early in a case to ensure that a jury has the opportunity to examine all relevant evidence. \n \n Our Phoenix personal injury attorneysF believe in and regularly utilize technology to advance our clients\u2019 cases.

A personal injury case is formalized through civil court proceedings, which seek to find someone legally at fault through a court judgment; however, a more common resolution is an informal settlement before a lawsuit has been filed. There are many different types of accidents and ways that people may get hurt. Here is a list of some Arizona laws that Phoenix personal injury lawyers commonly use: \n \n Statute of Limitations - Injury to Person-Two Years (ARS \u00a7 12-542) \n \n Limits on Damages - Prohibited (Article 2, Section 31 Arizona State Const.) \n \n Other Limits - Comparative Fault System (ARS \u00a7 12-2501) \n \n Notice of Accident - Required (ARS \u00a7 28-666) \n \n Arizona Auto Insurance - Mandatory (ARS \u00a7 28-4009) \n \n Negligence - Pure Comparative Negligence (ARS \u00a7 12-2505) \n \n Wrongful Death - Liability (ARS \u00a7 12-611) \n \n Product Liability - Liability (ARS \u00a7 12-551) \n \n Premises Liability - Injuries Resulting from Condition of Property (Premises Liability Instruction No. 1, RAJI (5th)) \n \n Consult with a lawyer to learn more about the applicable statute of limitations that could apply to your injury or wrongful death case. \n \n Arizona Minimum Insurance Requirements \n \n Arizona operates under a traditional \u201ctort\u201d vehicle insurance model. This means that drivers who are involved in a vehicle accident have several options for recovery, including: file a claim with their own auto insurance company, file a claim with the at-fault driver\u2019s auto insurance company, or file a personal injury lawsuit against the at-fault driver. \n \n Insurance is extremely important because it protects a person, or entity, from extreme financial loss due to an accident. Under ARS \u00a7 28-4009, drivers must carry liability insurance with at least the following amounts of coverage: \n \n $15,000 per person for bodily injury or death \n \n $30,000 per accident for two or more persons\u2019 injuries or death, and \n \n $10,000 for property damage or destruction \n \n The insurance amounts for bodily injury or death liability cover costs if you are involved in an accident and you are considered to be at fault. Additionally, the property damage amount pays for the damage or destruction caused to someone else\u2019s property. \n \n In Arizona, underinsured liability coverage and uninsured liability coverage are not mandatory. However, ARS \u00a7 20-259.01 requires that every insurer writing an automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy offer, in writing, uninsured and underinsured coverage to their insureds in an amount equal to the insured\u2019s liability coverage. If the insureds reject this coverage, insurers must prove compliance with the statute by having their insureds sign a Department of Insurance (\u201cDOI\u201d) approved form selecting or rejecting such coverage. \n \n Accident Victims Beware: Arizona Healthcare Provider Liens and Insurance Reimbursement in Personal Injury Cases \n \n One of the least understood areas of Arizona personal injury matters is healthcare provider liens and health insurance reimbursement. In Phoenix, virtually every major hospital and healthcare provider automatically files healthcare provider liens with the Maricopa County Recorder\u2019s Office in cases where patients are admitted because of a car accident. Many accident victims don\u2019t realize that these liens are filed even when they have insurance for the balance between what is paid by health insurance and the amount the hospital claims is their actual, \u201cfull\u201d rate. In Arizona, this is called a \u201cbalance lien.\u201d Other healthcare providers may file these types of liens as well. \n \n Healthcare liens are governed by ARS \u00a7 33-931 through ARS \u00a7 33-936. The statutes essentially provide a mechanism for healthcare providers to impose a lien against an injured person\u2019s third party personal injury claim. This remedy however, is limited. Injured parties must have an underlying and outstanding obligation to a healthcare provider for the services related to the third party claim. Furthermore, if an insurance company has satisfied the obligation, such as paying the bills in full, the lien must be released.[1] \n \n It\u2019s important to note that these accident liens do not attach to anything other than any recovery you might receive in your claim. The lien does not apply to your home, your car, or your wages. And you only have to pay it if you recover money, and they are generally capped at the amount of your recovery. Healthcare provider liens only secure a provider\u2019s \u201ccustomary charges\u201d for lien related services. These \u201ccustomary charges\u201d act as a cap. The cap \u201cprevents the lien from being an amount greater than what the provider typically charges other patients for the services that it provided to the injured party.\u201d[2] \n \n Just because a lien is filed, doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s the end of the story. In many cases, these liens can be negotiated or waived. Legal and equitable arguments exist that can reduce these amounts. Some of the more common arguments include: \n \n The healthcare provider did not perfect their lien by timely recording the lien in the office of the county recorder in the county where the healthcare provider is located.[3] There are different timing requirements depending on what type of provider is attempting to perfect the lien. \n \n The healthcare provider did not include \u201ca statement regarding whether the patient\u2019s treatment has been terminated or will be continued.\u201d[4] \n \n Healthcare provider liens do not extend to claims for health insurance and underinsured and uninsured motorist coverage.[5] \n \n The lien amounts were erroneous or exceed the \u201ccustomary charges.\u201d[6] \n \n The care, treatment or transportation which gave rise to the charges, was not medically necessary.[7] \n \n The care, treatment or transportation was not causally related to the event, giving rise to the claim to which the lien extends. \n \n In addition to healthcare providers, most major health insurance plans have the right to reimbursement for personal injury claims. Reimbursement clauses provide that insurers may be paid back for amounts they pay on your behalf if you are involved in a car accident. \n \n The issue is complicated, however, because Arizona is an anti-subrogation state which provides that an assignment of personal injury cause of action is prohibited.[8] An anti-subrogation law precludes a person or entity from stepping in to take over the rights and remedies of another. For large self-funded ERISA plans, however, federal law on the subject preempts state law. For these large plans, federal law provides that reimbursement is permissible in accident and injury cases where there is a recovery. \n \n Again, just because your health insurance company claims it\u2019s owed money doesn\u2019t always make it so. In many cases, the first step your Phoenix injury lawyer will take is to ensure that the plan is in fact self-funded under ERISA guidelines. \n \n Where Do Accident Victims File Personal Injury Cases in Arizona? \n \n In Phoenix, as in most jurisdictions in the United States, the majority of personal injury cases do not go to trial. At the Lamber Goodnow team, our goal is to frontload matters to get cases resolved for accident victims and their families prior to going to court. In some cases, however, court is necessary. \n \n For Phoenix-based injury and wrongful death cases, plaintiffs generally have the option of filing in two different courts: state or federal. \n \n State Court System \n \n Maricopa County Superior Court: Most Phoenix-based personal injury cases start in Maricopa County Superior Court. The general jurisdiction court is the Superior Court of Arizona, a statewide trial court. It is a single entity with locations in each county. Each county has at least one superior court judge. In counties with more than one superior court judge, the judges operate in numbered divisions. The superior court acts as an appellate court for justice and municipal courts. To qualify to be a superior court judge, one must be at least 30 years old, of good moral character and admitted to the practice of law in Arizona and a resident of Arizona for the five years immediately before taking office. This court hears the widest variety of cases and keeps permanent records of court proceedings. Maricopa County Superior Court has the largest number of judges in Arizona. \n \n Arizona Court of Appeals, Division 1: Arizona appellate courts have jurisdiction to review trials and decisions appealed to them. Arizona has two appellate courts: the court of appeals is the intermediate appellate court and the Supreme Court is the court of last resort. The court of appeals has two divisions: Division One in Phoenix (16 judges) and Division Two in Tucson (six judges). The court of appeals hears and decides cases in three judge panels, has jurisdiction in all matters properly appealed from the superior court and reviews all decisions properly appealed to it. A court of appeals judge must be at least 30 years old, of good moral character, admitted to the practice of law in Arizona and a resident of Arizona for the five years immediately before taking office. Most appeals come from the superior court, except for death penalty appeals and some cases involving elected officials and disputes between counties, which go directly to the Supreme Court. After a case concludes (or before then in special circumstances), the losing party may appeal to the Arizona state appellate court. \n \n Arizona Supreme Court: To appeal a decision from the court of appeals, the appellant must file a Petition for Review requesting a Supreme Court hearing. The Supreme Court judges, known as justices, evaluate the petitions for review and decide whether they will review the case. Unlike the court of appeals, the Supreme Court is not required to hear every appeal. The Arizona Supreme Court takes up issues regarding personal injury and wrongful death matters with regularity. \n \n In order for a case to successfully go to trial in Arizona, the plaintiff\u2019s Phoenix personal injury attorney must: \n \n \n \n 1. File a document (complaint) with the clerk of the court stating the reasons why the plaintiff is suing the defendant, and what action the plaintiff wants the court to take. \n \n 2. State whether the case is eligible for arbitration according to court rule. If the parties agree to arbitration, they are agreeing to meet with an impartial third party before going to trial, where they will discuss the issues in dispute and accept the arbiter\u2019s decision. \n \n 3. Deliver (serve) a copy of the complaint and a summons to the defendant. \n \n 4. File a written answer admitting or denying the statements in the complaint. \n \n 5. Exchange information about the personal injury case. This is called discovery. \n \n 6. The case is tried before a jury or a judge. \n \n 7. The judge makes a decision, or the jury gives its verdict, based on the testimony and other evidence presented during trial. The Arizona Constitution and ARS \u00a7 21-102 state that a civil jury shall consist of eight persons, and the concurrence of all but two shall be necessary to render a verdict. \n \n 8. The losing party may appeal the decision to the next higher level of the court. \n \n To find an Arizona court in your county click here. \n \n Federal Court System \n \n In some cases, residents of Phoenix also have the option of filing their personal injury case in federal court. The United States District Court for the District of Arizona is the federal court for Arizona and is part of the Ninth Circuit. The District was established on June 20, 1910, pending Arizona statehood on February 14, 1912. This is the sole federal judicial district in Arizona. There are court locations in Phoenix, Tucson, Yuma, Flagstaff and Prescott. \n \n If you file in federal court your case would initially be heard by a district court. There are 94 district courts in the nation. A district judge will hear the case and a jury will decide the case. Unlike state court, however, a federal court jury may range from a minimum of six to twelve members and unless the parties stipulate otherwise, the verdict must be unanimous.[9] \n \n A court of appeals hears challenges to district court decisions from courts located within its circuit, as well as appeals from decisions of federal administrative agencies. There are 13 appellate courts that sit below the U.S. Supreme Court. The appeals courts consist of three judges and do not use a jury. \n \n The Supreme Court is the highest court in the United States. Article III of the United States Constitution created the Supreme Court and authorized Congress to pass laws establishing a lower system of courts. The Supreme Court hears cases appealed from lower federal courts, cases that are appealed from state supreme courts and cases between state governments. \n \n In order to have a viable claim in federal court, the court must have jurisdiction to hear the matter. It is important to find a Phoenix personal injury lawyer that knows the requirements to file in federal court. A federal court has jurisdiction over a matter if there is a federal question or if it is a diversity of citizenship case. 28 US Code \u00a7 1331 states that federal question jurisdiction means that the court may hear matters arising under the Constitution, federal law or treaty. Diversity cases empower the federal court to hear controversies between parties who are citizens of different states. 28 U.S. Code \u00a7 1332 states that in order to have a viable diversity case: \n \n 1. The amount in controversy must exceed the value of $75,000, and \n \n 2. The parties in the case must be citizens of different states. \n \n If the parties in the case are citizens of different states this means that there is complete diversity. A person\u2019s state of citizenship is determined by a person\u2019s domicile. Domicile is the state in which the person is physically present and in which they intend to remain permanently. \n \n Additionally, Supreme Court justices, court of appeals judges and district court judges are nominated by the President and confirmed by the United States Senate, as stated in the United States Constitution Article II Section 2. \n \n Arizona also has Justice and City courts. However, these courts do not hear personal injury matters. Your Phoenix personal injury lawyer should review all aspects of your case and determine whether you should file your case in state or federal court. \n \n As a practical matter, Phoenix-based accident victim lawyers often choose to file personal injury matters in Maricopa County Superior Court because they do not then have the burden of needing a unanimous jury to win. \n \n [1] Abbott v.

Instead, they carry liability insurance with at least $30,000 in coverage. The reason? If you're involved in a personal injury case and you're considered at fault, you're more likely to have an accident than if you're not. As the Goodnow Law Team explains, liability insurance is a way for people to make sure they have enough coverage to pay for their injuries, even if they didn't cause the accident in the first place. In addition to carrying liability insurance, people are required to carry a copy of the law in case they get into an accident.

A week later, he took to \u201cState of the Union\u201d on CNN to chat about sequestration (bad) and the attack in Benghazi (worse). \n \n In May, he was on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d talking about Middle East politics with Chris Wallace. Last week, Mr. McCain, who was in California for his oldest son\u2019s wedding, hit \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on CBS, via satellite, to discuss his trip to Syria. \n \n Mr. McCain, Republican of Arizona, is not his party\u2019s most recent presidential nominee. He is no longer the highest-ranking Republican on any major Congressional committee. And as party spokesmen go, these days he is just as often speaking against Congressional Republicans as with them. \n \n Yet on many given Sundays \u2014 over 60 of them since 2010 \u2014 Mr. McCain repairs to a television studio in Washington to hold forth. On \u201cFace the Nation\u201d alone, Mr. McCain has appeared more than any other politician in the program\u2019s 60-year history. \n \n His Sunday ubiquity has set off some grumbling in Washington that producers give him too much airtime. It also tends to solidify the impression in living rooms across America that he remains the spokesman for, and titular head of, his party. \n \n \u201cReally?\u201d Mr. McCain said with a soup\u00e7on of glee when informed of his record-breaking Sunday showiness. \u201cWell I enjoy them. I find it is the best way to communicate with the American people.\u201d \n \n In many ways, the Sunday morning talk shows are like ID lanyards and BlackBerries. While much of the nation has lost interest in them, they hold a big \u2014 some would say disproportionate \u2014 sway in Washington. \n \n The programs\u2019 producers and members of Congress \u2014 and, to some degree, White House officials \u2014 collaborate in a weekly seduction ritual in which producers try mightily to get the most powerful guests and newsmakers of the moment, as the guests\u2019 staffs weigh the risks of stepping before some of the toughest questioners in Washington. \n \n When it comes to a dream guest, program hosts say, Mr. McCain checks almost every box: a senior Republican senator who can speak authoritatively and contemporaneously on many issues, flies secretly to Syria, compares members of his own party to deranged fowl and yet is a reliable opponent of most Obama administration policies. \n \n \u201cWhat makes a good guest is someone who makes news,\u201d said Mr. Wallace, the Fox host. \u201cTo make news, you have to be at the center of the news and willing to talk about it in a noncanned way, someone who always come to the shows ready to play.\u201d \n \n He went on: \u201cI sometimes think to myself, \u2018Gee we\u2019ve had McCain on a lot,\u2019 \u201d not to mention Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. \u201cBut the fact of the matter is they are good guests.\u201d \n \n And good guests become frequent guests. The programs tend to be dominated by a handful of predictably quotable politicians. Others make only rare appearances when a pet issue rears its head. And still others, by choice or by elimination, never make the cut at all. \n \n \u201cI usually go where I\u2019m asked,\u201d said Senator Johnny Isakson, Republican of Georgia, who has not been on a Sunday talk show in the last few years. \u201cI did Greta the other night,\u201d Mr. Isakson pointed out, referring to the Fox News program \u201cOn the Record With Greta Van Susteren.\u201d \n \n Mr. Isakson, like several other Republicans, says Mr. McCain does not serve as a spokesman for them or their party. \u201cWe all speak for ourselves,\u201d he said. \n \n Critics of the Sunday programs argue that the words spoken on them are at once too calculated and overly interpreted, simply by virtue of where they are delivered. \u201cYou can go on Charlie Rose midweek and have a long conversation that ends in a game of strip poker and no one will pay attention,\u201d said Philippe Reines, a senior adviser to former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. \u201cYou go on a Sunday show, and everyone is looking for the slightest change, a new syllable, some new nuance.\u201d \n \n The prominence of guests with strong points of view can give viewers a false sense of proportion to certain sides of policy debates. This is most clearly the case with Mr. McCain, whose advocacy for military intervention in Syria and criticism of the administration\u2019s policies there might create a sense that there is a robust policy debate over the matter in Washington when there really is not. \n \n \u201cIn order to deal with complexity but also create a basis for entertainment,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a vice president at the Woodrow Wilson Center, \u201cyou need someone who knows what they are talking about who is pursuing daylight between themselves and the administration.\u201d \n \n Many guests believe that the talk shows also contribute to the partisan disharmony in Washington, though that may be like blaming a speck of pepper for the flavor of a 10-gallon pot of soup. Even the highest-rated programs attract fewer than 2.5 million viewers, a tiny audience by the standards of network television. \n \n \u201cThere is a tendency on the Sunday shows to look more toward partisan polarization,\u201d said David Gergen, a senior analyst for CNN who has advised four presidents. \u201cThey seek out people who are further out on the spectrum,\u201d Mr. Gergen said, adding that \u201cmore than one senator\u201d has told him the story of being bumped for a more partisan guest when they expressed moderate positions on issues in pre-interviews, something producers and hosts say is untrue. \n \n \u201cWe aren\u2019t looking for someone because of their ideological view,\u201d said Bob Schieffer, the chief Washington correspondent for CBS and the moderator of \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cWe are trying to move the story forward.\u201d \n \n Many Congressional staff members, when faced with the weekly talk show requests, apply the Hippocratic oath: first, do no harm. One misstatement or shading can hurt a campaign and damage a career, as Susan E. Rice, who is the United States ambassador to the United Nations and is about to become Mr. Obama\u2019s national security adviser, learned when she went on a series of shows one Sunday last September to discuss the attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. \n \n The term \u201ctalking points\u201d will now follow her into retirement. \n \n Mrs. Clinton avoided the Sunday talk shows for most of her short Senate career and wisely avoided the cameras after the Benghazi episode; Mr. Obama also stayed away when he was a senator, recalled Tommy Vietor, a former spokesman for the National Security Council, until Hurricane Katrina. \n \n \u201cThat was around an event and a message,\u201d Mr. Vietor said. \u201cIt made sense to do it. To go on as a lawmaker and play pundit minimizes you as a lawmaker.\u201d \n \n Some of the hosts complain that the White House sends out far too few high-level officials, a contention underscored by Mr. Schieffer\u2019s thinly veiled contempt for the White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer when he appeared on a recent Sunday to address a variety of scandals that have bedeviled the administration. \n \n \u201cThey tend to send out people who don\u2019t seem to have direct knowledge of the story,\u201d Mr. Schieffer said, noting that Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was a frequent guest when he was a senator but rarely appeared now. Mr. Schieffer added that Mrs. Clinton would have been preferable to Ms. Rice after the Benghazi attack. \n \n Despite their low ratings, the Sunday talk shows make headlines, and they are closely watched by Washington power brokers. Even the programs\u2019 critics concede that they are a rite of power passage for politicians making their way to the top. \n \n They can also be entertaining. Mr. Wallace remembered asking former President Bill Clinton a question that sent him into a paroxysm of rage. \u201cMy first thought was, \u2018How am I go to handle this?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cSecond, I thought, \u2018This is great television.\u2019 \u201d \n \n Finally, because Mr. Clinton carried on at such length, Mr. Wallace thought of the South Carolina senator waiting in the wings. \u201cWe had to call and bump Lindsey,\u201d he said. ||||| Sen. John McCain on Sunday defended the wide-reaching government surveillance programs revealed last week, arguing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court system gives them \u201cappropriate.\u201d \n \n Asked on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d whether he was bothered by the programs, the Arizona Republican replied: \u201cNo, not really.\u201d \n \n \u201cI believe that the FISA court system is an appropriate way of reviewing these policies,\u201d said McCain, a top defense hawk on Capitol Hill. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Guardian reporter talks about NSA reporting) \n \n \u201cTo somehow think that because we are having phone calls recorded as far as their length and who they were talking to, I don\u2019t think that that is necessarily wrong if they want to go further and they have to go to this court,\u201d McCain added. \n \n The phone-records program has its defenders in Congress, with top intelligence leaders arguing that those methods helped prevent potential terrorist attacks.

POLITICO caught up with them before the show to get their take on Sheen. ||||| Correction: Earlier versions of this article misspelled the name of reality-TV personality Tareq Salahi. This version has been corrected. \n \n A couple of thousand people were held hostage by Charlie Sheen\u2019s ego Tuesday night in an auditorium named after the female descendants of the American Revolution, half a mile from the World War II Memorial in the capital of the free world. This prompts an icky existential question: If the abusive ex-star of a CBS sitcom can compel a legion of citizens to pay $104.25 apiece to be doused in cultural bile, is the free world a little too free? \n \n The answer, of course, is no. Mostly no. No, except for the five seconds after Sheen seemed to imply that he believes President Obama wasn\u2019t born in the United States, triggering boisterous applause from the mostly young, near-capacity crowd at the 3,700-seat DAR Constitution Hall. Sheen seemed to toy with the idea of running for president (with Nicolas Cage) and noted that his birth certificate was not \u201cPhotoshopped.\u201d \n \n The man has become so unreadable that it was hard to tell whether he was joking or serious. He was, though, noncommittal about running and occasionally circumspect. \n \n \u201cEvery day is just one day,\u201d Sheen said at the top of the show. \u201cTomorrow is not here yet.\u201d \n \n It was the end of a long day for Sheen, who deployed his lawyers to two court hearings in Southern California on Tuesday morning, charioted himself in a black Rolls-Royce to the Van Nuys Airport that afternoon, and blazed across the continent in a private jet to walk onstage 67 minutes late for his show in downtown Washington, the halfway point in his 20-city tour titled \u201cViolent Torpedo of Truth: Defeat Is Not an Option,\u201d a kind of Sherman\u2019s March of the male libido. \n \n Washington as a whole greeted Sheen with a feisty, inebriated bear hug, but there was some wonky thoughtfulness in the crowd. \n \n \u201cI came here to see Charlie Sheen on an extended loop and be both horrified and entertained,\u201d said a 34-year-old lobbyist who declined to give her name because she\u2019s a \u201cprofessional girl\u201d who \u201ccares about my future.\u201d \n \n \u201cNot often can you see a public figure implode in front of your eyes \u2014 usually you can only see that through the media,\u201d said her 40-year-old lobbyist friend, who was also too embarrassed to be identified. \n \n \u201cWe perpetuate this image that is fake and a lie, and we put it on television,\u201d railed a TV reporter into her cellphone \u2014 presumably to an editor \u2014 as she prepared to do a spot from outside the venue before the show started. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel as a journalist.\u201d \n \n Me, too, but here\u2019s the straightest scoop deliverable: The show began with a stream-of-consciousness monologue about Sheen\u2019s hatred of ex-wives and his failure to secure sole custody of his children earlier in the day. It lurched onward to a dry sit-down interview \u2014 led by much-booed WBIG (100.3 FM) host Tommy Griffiths \u2014 about the first time Sheen met Marlon Brando. The crowd quaked with catcalls whenever Sheen wasn\u2019t talking about doing drugs or manhandling women. \n \n \u201cENTERTAIN US,\u201d boomed a male voice as Sheen waxed philosophical on the hard living of Dennis Hopper. \n \n \u201cSHUT THE [EXPLETIVE] UP AND SAY SOMETHING WEIRD,\u201d demanded another. \n \n It has been less than two months since Sheen outed himself as a warlock who is capable of ingesting \u201cepic\u201d amounts of cocaine, vanquishing addiction with his superhuman mind, shrugging off his nearly $2 million-an-episode job with Warner Bros. and orating on national television about the vague, seemingly mutable bylaws of nature and space-time (Google \u201cwinning\u201d and \u201ctiger blood\u201d and \u201cAdonis DNA\u201d and so on). \n \n In the first week or so of his renaissance (or breakdown, depending on your standards), it seemed as if Sheen was onto something, as if he were imbued with a spiritual clarity reserved for prophets, as if he were pulverizing and remolding the very notion of celebrity. \n \n That notion of celebrity now seems to belong to his audiences \u2014 or at least the one at DAR, whose restlessness guided the rhythms of the show and whose outbursts were often more entertaining than the ramblings of Sheen or his better-received guest, stand-up comic Jeff Ross. \n \n \u201cCuriosity about exploitation\u201d was why 33-year-old Arlington salesman Johnny Champane came with three friends at the last minute. \u201cExploitation of himself.

Challenging the rejection of their mercy petitions, the advocate Sudeep Jaiswal will move the Bombay High Court on Tuesday. \n \n \n \n The sisters, Renuka Shinde and Seema Gavit were sentenced to death in 2001 for kidnapping 13 children and killing nine of them between June 1990 and October 1996.

Anjana Gavit died in jail while Kiran Shinde became an approver. \n \n \n \n Till the time the court decides on the petition, their execution will be stayed. Speaking to Mumbai Mirror, Jaiswal said he has informed the jail authorities about the move in writing. \n \n \n \n Additional Director General of Police (Jails) Meeran Borwankar said, \"We are following all legal procedures and the recent Supreme Court guidelines.\" \n \n \n \n The sisters, lodged at Yerwada Jail, were notified about the rejection of their mercy petition verbally earlier in August and the 14-day buffer period before their execution ends this Saturday. \n \n \n \n According to Jaiswal, the order sent to the jail authorities read, \"The report of communication of rejection of mercy petition of condemned prisoner shall be submitted with physical and mental health report.\"A minimum buffer period of 14 days is given between the receipt of communication of rejection of mercy petition and execution, so that the convicts can prepare themselves, settle affairs with family members or avail any judicial remedy. \n \n \n \n Meanwhile, Jaiswal said, \"I met the two sisters recently.

In 2006, they were convicted by the Supreme Court of five of those murders. \n \n Since then, a Damocles sword has been hanging over the fate of the duo, set to earn notoriety as the first women to be hanged in the history of Independent India. \n \n The two-week buffer period before their execution came to an end last Saturday. \n \n \u2018No intimation yet\u2019 \n \n \n \n \u201cThere has been no intimation on the issue from the State Home Ministry as yet. There has been no word on the black warrant,\u201d said Yogesh Desai, Superintendent, Yerwada Central Jail, while refusing to comment on the preparations. \n \n The sisters, hailing from Kolhapur, were initiated into crime by their mother while still in their teens. They were sentenced to death by the Kolhapur Sessions Court in 2001. Since then, they have been languishing in Yerwada Jail. \n \n Between 1990 and 1996, they allegedly killed nine children \u2014 all under the age of 10 \u2014 by starving them or banging their heads (especially those of toddlers) against walls or electricity poles. The kidnappings and murders were spread over Pune, Thane, Kalyan, Kolhapur, and Nashik. \n \n \u201cThe sisters\u2019 modus operandi was using small children, often toddlers, as diversions to distract the public while one of them was engaged in stealing purses. When in the danger of being caught, the other used to throw or bang the child to the ground or any hard surface. The object was to elicit sympathy by manipulating the public\u2019s emotions,\u201d says human rights lawyer and activist, Asim Sarode. \n \n Speaking to The Hindu, Mr. Sarode, who, at one time, assisted the Apex Court judge with the case, recounts the eerie calmness with which Renuka Shinde answered his questions about the murders, all the time stroking a stray cat. \n \n \u201cIn one of their particularly gruesome murders, they hung a two-year-old upside down, bashed his head against the wall and chopped him to pieces. They then went for a movie at a local theatre in Kolhapur, eating bhel puri. All the while, the bag, with the chopped remains remained under their feet,\u201d he says. \n \n \u201cWhile I\u2019m professionally and personally against the capital punishment, this is indeed one of the rarest of the rare cases where the perpetrators deserve the death sentence,\u201d remarked Mr. Sarode. \n \n Files appeal \n \n \n \n Following the end of the buffer period, the duo has filed an appeal at the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court. According to the sisters\u2019 defence counsel in Kolhapur, Manik Mulik, the murders had been committed by their mother, Anjana, who died two years after the duo\u2019s arrest in 1996. \n \n \u201cThe case against the sisters primarily rests on the statement of Renuka\u2019s husband, Kiran Shinde, who turned approver naming Anjana as having carried out the kidnappings and killings. As Anjana died even before the trial began, the police made him change his statement in which he blamed his wife (Renuka) and sister-in-law (Seema Gavit),\u201d said Mr. Mulik. \n \n \n \n \n \n",

More than a decade later, DNA evidence confirmed McGuire's guilt, and he acknowledged that he was responsible in a letter to Gov. John Kasich last month. \n \n The state planned to execute McGuire on Thursday with a new process adopted after supplies of its previous drug dried up when the manufacturer put it off limits for capital punishment.

Running 200ish miles from Chattanooga to Nashville, TN is not an impossible feat but it takes true teamwork. Joshua Collier and his team know what it takes to support each other, and this weekend at Ragnar Tennessee they are running for a very special cause. This is their story: \n \n I run Ragnar for Owen Torti. Owen is just under the age of 2 and has a rare metabolic disorder- LCHAD. LCHAD is known as an orphan disease, which means no research or funding will be directed to finding a cure or long-term solution\u2026 unless light is shone on the disorder or a celebrity/organization steps in, raises awareness and leverages their platform (similar to the ALS ice-bucket challenge). \n \n What started as a group of 12 individuals simply looking for team building through the Ragnar Run is slowly turning into a movement at our office. Our entire company of 500 is becoming \u201call in for owen.\u201d Together we are raising awareness and directing others to www.allinforowen.com. We now have two Ragnar teams, instead of one, who will be running for Owen in the upcoming run in Chattanooga, TN (Oct. 23-24). And in addition to raising awareness we will be raising funds to help sustain and encourage Owen\u2019s family and LCHAD families worldwide. The families, like Owen\u2019s, are weary and need someone to hand the baton off too so they can rest, recharge, and then pick-up the baton again and run the next part of their leg. \n \n So, \u201cWhy we run Ragnar?\u201d \n \n I\u2026no\u2026 we\u2026the team AllinforOwen runs Ragnar for Owen Torti. \n \n We run because a group of 12 individuals has been transformed into a team. \n \n We run because one team has turned into two Ragnar teams. \n \n We run to raise awareness for a family whose son has a rare metabolic disorder. \n \n We run to bring an orphan disease (LCHAD) into the light. \n \n We run to connect families around the world, who are isolated by a disorder, to see that they are not alone. \n \n We run to raise awareness for a family who refuses to give up. \n \n We run to give HOPE to a family who is giving hope to others. \n \n We run because the Ragnar race is not just an event but a model of how we should run with and spur each other on\u2026 on a day to day basis. \n \n ||||| A Georgia family is hoping to raise awareness for their 23-month-old boy after he was diagnosed with a rare metabolic disorder that means he has to eat every hour to stay healthy. \n \n Owen Torti was diagnosed with LCHAD (Long-chain 3-hydroxy acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase) when he was just a newborn, his mother, Kayla Torti, told ABC News. \n \n The rare genetic disorder means Owen's body is unable to break down certain fatty acids into energy. As a result, he must eat nearly constantly or else his body would start to break down key muscles in the search for energy. \n \n \"If we had breakfast and skipped lunch [our body] would use up the energy from breakfast ... [to] break down stored fats for energy,\" Torti explained. \"Owen\u2019s body cannot do that. It breaks down his muscles and can cause problems with kidneys or liver or heart.\" \n \n Despite the genetic illness, Owen still looks and acts much like any other toddler, Torti said. \n \n \"He wants to act like a normal 2-year-old and he wants to go and play and run around as long as the other 2-year-olds,\" Torti said. \"Unfortunately, we have to have him sit down and take little breaks. ... He doesn\u2019t know how to pace himself.\" \n \n The National Institutes of Health does not have a firm estimate for how often the disease appears in the U.S. but says in Finland it appears in about 1 of every 62,000 births. Torti said she was told by her doctors that the condition can be related to a syndrome called HELLP syndrome, which can affect a pregnant woman's red blood cells, liver enzymes and platelets. \n \n Since Owen needs to constantly be fed, he doesn't quite understand the purpose of a meal, Torti said. \n \n \"From feeding Owen so frequently, he has a lot of oral aversion to eating,\" Torti explained to ABC News. \"Solid foods is so hard for him right now.\" \n \n Torti said she is hopeful that as Owen grows, he'll be able have a fairly normal life as he learns what his limitations are. \n \n There\u2019s not a lot known about how this will affect him in future and what he will and won\u2019t be able to do, Torti said. \n \n \"We\u2019re hopeful that he can manage and he\u2019ll know his body enough,\u201d she said. ||||| Owen was born 9 weeks premature. At 7 days old Owen was diagnosed with LCHAD (Long-chain 3-hydroxy acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase) via the newborn screening. \n \n LCHAD is a rare condition that prevents the body from converting certain fats to energy. \n \n Because Owen\u2019s body cannot break down fat, once his tiny storage of energy is depleted his body starts looking for other sources for energy. When it starts breaking down his muscles for energy, the slippery slope of a metabolic crisis has begun. \n \n Owen has been hospitalized 12 times in 20 months \u2013 primarily due to metabolic crisis. During a metabolic crisis, he experiences muscle breakdown. If not treated, breathing problems, seizures, coma and sometimes even death can occur. \n \n Owen is on a special medical formula called Lipistart. Owen has never been able to eat/drink much and now no longer eats or drinks anything by mouth. At 16 months Owen had a G-Tube placed to allow assistance with feeding him. \n \n Owen needs to enter an intensive feeding program through Baylor in Dallas, TX \n \n Money raised will help with: Past medical bills. Paying for formula that is not covered by insurance. The feeding program. \n \n This has been a journey that Kayla and Tyler did not anticipate - filled with fear, tears, anger, questions, laughter, joy and much prayer. They have found strength in each other, in the amazing love and support from those who have followed Owen\u2019s story, and in their faith. Owen\u2019s name means \u201cyoung warrior\u201d and he is a fighter. We believe God has big plans for this precious little boy. \n \n \n \n Below is more of their story through the eyes of Gammy... \n \n \n \n I am \u201cGammy\u201d to Owen; Mom to Kayla; and the \u201cteam mom\u201d where I work. Three months ago, a couple of guys from my office decided they would like to participate in the 200 mile Ragnar Relay. Within a few days the idea turned into a team of 12 guys wanting to do more than run for the typical reasons of getting in shape and team building \u2013 they wanted to run for a bigger purpose. They decided to run for my 23 month old grandson Owen, who has a rare metabolic disorder called LCHAD. I was overwhelmed. When I called and told Kayla, we both cried and she said it was so amazing for them to run for Owen because this is something he would not be able to do because of LCHAD. \n \n \n \n \u201cAll in for Owen\u201d has truly become a team effort \u2013 my entire department and another running team from our office has joined. No words can express the depth of gratitude for all those who have given of their time and resources. Not only has the love of all those who have helped with this project brought strength to Kayla and Tyler, but our desire is that sharing their story will give hope to others who face unexpected challenges. \n \n \n \n On November 15, 2013 life forever changed for Kayla and Tyler Torti. After two years of infertility, they were beyond thrilled to find out they were going to a have baby! At 31 weeks, Kayla realized that something was wrong and was told to go to the hospital. She was diagnosed with HELLP Syndrome which was caused from Owen\u2019s disorder. The doctor explained that to protect Kayla from the possibility of having a stroke or her liver rupturing, they needed to quickly do a c-section. Within a few hours, Owen entered the world at 3 lbs.14 oz. and spent the next 39 days in the NICU. \n \n \n \n Because of the Newborn Screening, within a few days of his birth, the doctor\u2019s broke the news that Owen had LCHAD \u2013 an orphan disease that affects around 1 in 100,000 children. Even the medical community, other than the genetics team, knew very little about this disorder. So began a frightening, unknown journey of caring for a baby whose body could not break down long-chain fats and had to be fed every 3 hours around the clock to prevent his body from breaking down muscles for energy. \n \n \n \n Owen is a happy, fun little boy. To look at Owen, you would never dream he is physically fragile and that in these past 23 months has had to be hospitalized 12 times. Normal things like teething, a growth spurt, a common cold, getting too hot, getting too cold \u2013 can all cause Owen to go into a metabolic crisis. One of the primary ways that the doctor monitors his condition is through a CK (Creatine Kinase) blood test. This test provides information to know the level of muscle break down which releases protein molecules and enzymes into the bloodstream and puts a lot of pressure on the kidneys. To put this in perspective: the CK level for an athlete who has run a triathalon will be around 20,000. Owen\u2019s numbers have gone as high as 169,000. Owen\u2019s normal level should be 50-150. When his CK numbers are high it creates a risk to his heart, kidneys, liver and other organs. A number of children who have LCHAD have lost their sight. \n \n \n \n It is beyond difficult to watch Owen as he experiences a metabolic crisis. He loses muscle tone \u2013 including the ability to hold up his head. He often is too weak to even cry during these times. After each crisis, he regresses in walking because of the break down and weakness in his muscles. But through it all, he smiles. \n \n \n \n Owen has always struggled not only with eating, but vomiting. Because his life and health depend on him eating, at 16 months old the decision was made that Owen would benefit from a G-tube. He continues to vomit daily and the eating aversion has become so severe he is now unable to eat or drink anything by mouth so all of his nutrition comes through the feeding tube. He is fed every hour through the G-tube during the day, and at night or naptime he is on continuous feed. \n \n \n \n Through Baylor Health in Dallas, TX there is an inpatient feeding program that has a team of professionals (psychologist, occupational therapist, physical therapist, feeding therapist) that work with babies/children facing severe eating disorders. This program has seen amazing results. Although there is a waiting list, hopefully in January he will be accepted into the program. \n \n \n \n With a grateful heart..... \n \n LeeAnn (Gammy)",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 To all the new parents struggling to feed their newborn every two to three hours, imagine having to do it every hour\u2014for years. Such is reality for the Torti family in Tennessee, whose son, Owen, now 23 months, was diagnosed with the rare metabolic disorder LCHAD (long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase) as an infant. Because his body doesn't break down certain foods into energy, Owen is at risk of his body breaking down his muscles for energy if he goes without food for more than an hour, reports ABC News. \"He wants to act like a normal 2-year-old and he wants to go and play and run around as long as the other 2-year-olds,\" mom Kayla Torti says. \"Unfortunately, we have to have him sit down and take little breaks. He doesn't know how to pace himself.\" LCHAD, which was first diagnosed in the 1990s, is so rare it only affects one in every 100,000 newborns and wasn't even on newborn screening tests until six years ago, reports WKRN Nashville. To help with medical bills, two teams recently ran the Ragnar Relay through Tennessee wearing \"All in for Owen\" shirts and raised $15,000. Owen was born nine weeks premature, according to the family's YouCaring page, and has been hospitalized 12 times in 20 months, typically when a metabolic breakdown causes breathing problems and seizures. If not treated, he could slip into a coma and even die. With the constant eating, his mother says he's developed an oral aversion to food and is on a special medical formula called Lipistart, administered largely through a feeding tube. The Tortis have a 25% chance of having a second child with the same disorder. (These parents are losing both their sons to a rare brain disease.)",

Health officials say the incubation period for the disease is 21 days, but it could appear eight to 10 days after exposure. \n \n Duncan began showing symptoms Sept. 24, when he first sought medical treatment at Texas Presbyterian, three blocks from the home of Troh. Duncan was sent home but was taken back to the hospital by ambulance Sept. 28. Two days later, last Tuesday, a blood test confirmed that he had Ebola. Health officials say the \u201c10-day threshold\u201d for the disease will fall within the next few days. \n \n View Graphic More than a dozen drugs are being studied for treating Ebola and other filoviruses. \n \n \u201cThis is a critical week. We need to be prepared in Dallas for what could happen if family members become ill,\u201d said David Lakey, commissioner of the Texas Department of Health Services. \u201cWe are doing contingency planning and praying for what if. I have been concentrating on what we need to do now to protect Dallas.\u201d \n \n None of the 10 \u201chigh risk\u201d people \u2014 including four people who lived in the apartment where Duncan stayed and six health-care workers \u2014 have developed symptoms, health officials said. Troh, who was moved to an undisclosed location with the three people who were in the apartment with Duncan, is still well, family members say. On Sunday, members of the Liberian community association were able to take her traditional Liberian food, including jollof rice, foo foo, cassava leaves and plantains. \u201cShe called me, \u2018I\u2019m eating some traditional Liberian food,\u2019 \u201d Lloyd said. \u201cShe was very happy about that.\u201d \n \n Health officials say they are continuing to watch 38 other people who had \u201cpossible contact\u201d with Duncan and were considered to be at lower risk. Twice a day, health officials are checking the temperature of the 48 people \u2014 of whom six are in mandated isolation. \n \n \u201cThey receive one call a day [to ask for a temperature reading] and one visit per day,\u201d said Sana Sayed, a spokeswoman for the city of Dallas. \u201cA health worker makes a physical contact with the 48 people being monitored every single day, seeing them and checking their temperature.\u201d \n \n Lakey would not discuss why hospital protocols failed to detect Duncan the first time he visited Texas Health Presbyterian with a 101.1 fever, complaining of abdominal pains. The hospital\u2019s decision to send him home put other people at risk. \n \n \u201cA lot of evaluations will take place to find out what happened on the first presentation to find out why wasn\u2019t a diagnosis made,\u201d Lakey said. \n \n Dallas County Commissioner John Wiley Price criticized the hospital for failing to heed warnings sent in July about what protocols hospitals should follow to treat infectious diseases. \n \n \u201cI said at the outset, Presbyterian is a boutique hospital next to a little Ellis Island,\u201d Price said, referring to the neighborhood where many residents are immigrants. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have insurance, you\u2019re not going to get treated. That\u2019s the elephant in the room.\u201d \n \n Texas Health Resources, the hospital network that includes Texas Health Presbyterian, responded to criticism Tuesday by saying, \u201cHe was treated the way any other patient would have been treated, regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care. We have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area.\u201d \n \n Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that the agency was exploring ways to increase the screening of passengers on both sides of the Atlantic. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re working very intensively on the screening process,\u201d Frieden said in a conference call with reporters Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at that entire process to see what more can be done.\u201d \n \n While he promised that \u201cadditional steps\u201d were coming, Frieden did not elaborate on what that would include. Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in an interview Tuesday that Frieden told him that the plan is to have \u201ctougher types of screening on U.S. soil.\u201d \n \n Still, Frieden said the CDC has had teams on the ground working to strengthen the screening of passengers leaving West Africa. The screening has included taking temperatures, keeping an eye out for other symptoms and having travelers fill out questionnaires. \n \n He said the CDC methods have been used to screen more than 36,000 people over two months. And of those travelers, a small portion of whom were coming to the United States, only 77 people had a fever or other symptoms that caused them to be taken out of line, he said. \u201cAs far as we know, none of those 77 people had Ebola,\u201d Frieden noted. \n \n Of course, these methods are not perfect, as was made clear when Duncan filled out a questionnaire, had his temperature taken by a person trained by the CDC and boarded multiple flights on his way to Dallas. \n \n President Obama\u2019s promise of stepped-up screening for Ebola at U.S. airports that handle international flights will fall on the shoulders of the Customs and Border Protection officers who greet passengers arriving from abroad. \n \n Though they often seem preoccupied with scrutinizing passports and luggage, customs officers are trained to detect signs of illness, and they routinely do just that, officials said. \n \n \u201cCBP personnel review all travelers entering the United States for general overt signs of illnesses,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \n \n In addition to visual observations, CBP officers question passengers about their health and are instructed to alert the CDC if a passenger appears to be seriously ill. If a person is believed to have \u201ca possible communicable disease,\u201d they are isolated while the CDC and local authorities conduct the evaluation. \n \n Federal law requires pilots to radio ahead if a passenger dies or falls ill with certain symptoms. \n \n \u201cIf somebody comes in on a flight that has a fever or any one of those triggers, CDC can insert themselves at any point in the process,\u201d said Rob Yingling, spokesman for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, which runs Dulles International and Reagan National airports. \u201cThey can say [to the pilot], \u2018Tell us more about this case,\u2019 or they can actually physically go to the plane.\u201d \n \n The CDC maintains an office at Dulles and other major airports that handle international flights. \n \n Meanwhile, up to 4,000 service members are expected to head to West African countries ravaged by the Ebola epidemic. They will be monitored several times a day and, if any of them contract Ebola, they will be flown back to the United States aboard a specially designed plane for treatment. \n \n Among the tasks laid out for the military is the construction of 17 treatment centers for people with the disease. This will take until the middle of next month, according to Gen. David Rodriguez, chief of U.S. Africa Command. \n \n Mark Berman, Ashley Halsey III, Dan Lamonthe and Amy Ellis Nutt contributed to this report from Washington. ||||| DALLAS (AP) \u2014 The family of a man diagnosed with the first U.S. case of Ebola again visited him at the hospital Tuesday but declined to view him via video the last time had been too upsetting. \n \n Nowai Korkoya, mother of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, center, walks with the Rev.

Family members who were briefed by doctors said they were told Mr. Duncan\u2019s temperature and blood pressure are back to normal and the debilitating diarrhea Ebola brings had slowed. \n \n A little more than a week after testing positive for the virus, the patient, Thomas Eric Duncan, 42, remained in critical condition on Tuesday, while getting an experimental antiviral drug that doctors hope will help him recover. \n \n But his family, who gathered here today and held a vigil with the Rev. Jesse Jackson, said they had some reasons to be optimistic. \n \n \u201cWe are happy Eric is doing better. If all goes well we will be able to see him,\u201d his nephew, Josephus Weeks, said. \n \n Photo \n \n It is a critical week not just for Mr. Duncan but for the 48 people who had some contact with him after he showed signs of the disease. In this city, on edge over fears that Ebola could spread, officials have urged calm, saying those potentially exposed to the virus are being tracked and none have showed symptoms. \n \n Dr. David Lakey, the Texas health commissioner, said Tuesday that the next few days could be decisive in determining whether any of the 48 people who came in contact with Mr. Duncan develop the virus. \n \n According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the maximum incubation period for the virus is 21 days, but symptoms typically appear in eight to 10. Mr. Duncan, who apparently contracted the virus before flying to the United States, began complaining of symptoms on Sept. 24 and was hospitalized in isolation on Sept. 28. The 10-day threshold will pass by the middle of this week. \n \n Of the 48 people under observation, 10 are deemed to be at high risk, officials said. Three of those people shared an apartment with Mr. Duncan and seven are health care workers. The other 38 people are considered to be at lower risk. \n \n \u201cNone of them are sick, none of them have a fever,\u201d Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the director of the C.D.C., said Tuesday. \n \n Dr. Frieden said Mr. Duncan\u2019s condition and the lack of new cases were positive signs with implications for what he said will be a long fight against the disease. \n \n \u201cGlobally, this is going to be a long hard fight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can never forget that the enemy here is a virus, the enemy is Ebola, not people, not countries, not communities, a virus. And it\u2019s a virus that doesn\u2019t spread through the air, that we do know how to control. We do know how to stop it by isolating patients, doing contact tracing and breaking the chains of transmission. I can say one week in that there are real signs of progress not only in Dallas but also around the world.\u201d \n \n Since Saturday, Mr. Duncan has been receiving brincidofovir \u2014 an experimental drug developed to fight smallpox and other highly infectious viruses. The C.D.C. said there are no more doses of ZMapp, another experimental drug used on two American aid workers who later recovered from Ebola. \n \n Mr. Duncan\u2019s nephew said that despite signs of improvement, the virus has given his uncle serious infections in his lungs and kidneys, and Mr. Duncan has not yet turned a corner toward recovery. \n \n Mr. Duncan came to Dallas a few weeks ago from Liberia to reunite with Louise Troh, with whom he has a son. Now Ms. Troh, one of her other sons and two men who were staying with them are quarantined until late October. Local officials moved them a few days ago from a small apartment, which had towels and bedding contaminated with Ebola, to a modest four-bedroom ranch house that was donated by a church after officials were unable to find a house for the potentially infected family through traditional landlords. \n \n More Ebola Coverage \n \n \u201cThey are doing very well,\u201d said the Rev. George Mason of Wilshire Baptist Church, which Ms. Troh attends. \u201cThey are counting the days until they can come out.\u201d \n \n At the church on Tuesday night, Karsiah Duncan, Mr. Duncan\u2019s 19-year-old son with Ms. Troh, spoke publicly about his father for the first time. The younger Mr. Duncan had not seen his father since he was 3, when his parents separated in an Ivory Coast refugee camp and Ms. Troh left for the United States. He is a freshman at Angelo State University, west of Dallas, where he plays on the football team. \n \n A reunion was to be one of the highlights of Mr. Duncan\u2019s visit. Instead, Karsiah visited his father at the hospital on Tuesday evening. \n \n Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address. Please re-enter.

He thanked the doctors caring for his father, and paid tribute to the strength of his mother, who has been quarantined since Mr. Duncan was hospitalized on Sept. 28. \u201cKeep praying and let God do what he got to do.\u201d \n \n Mr. Mason, the pastor, said he had visited the family to bring a Bible and letters from his congregation. Liberians in the area have come to bring traditional foods such as potato greens, cassava leaves and pepper sauce, not supplied by aid agencies. A number of local officials coordinating the response, including Mayor Mike Rawlings of Dallas and Judge Clay Jenkins of Dallas County, have also stopped by. \n \n While they are careful to avoid contact, Mr. Mason said, they wear no protective clothing. \n \n \u201cThe science is clear,\u201d he said. \u201cIf they don\u2019t have symptoms, they are not contagious. We had a choice to act out of fear or out of love. We chose to act out of love.\u201d ||||| A member of the Cleaning Guys Haz Mat clean up company removes items from the apartment where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was staying before being admitted to a hospital on October 6, 2014 in Dallas, Texas. \n \n A member of the Cleaning Guys Haz Mat clean up company removes items from the apartment... Read More \n \n A member of the Cleaning Guys Haz Mat clean up company removes items from the apartment where Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan was staying before being admitted to a hospital on October 6, 2014 in Dallas, Texas. Close \n \n The care provided Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan may have cost as much as half a million dollars, a bill Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas is unlikely to ever collect. \n \n Duncan died today at the hospital, where he had been isolated since Sept. 28. He had been on a ventilator, was given an experimental medicine and began receiving dialysis when his kidney\u2019s failed Oct. 4, the hospital has said. His treatment included fluids replacement, blood transfusions and drugs to maintain blood pressure. There\u2019s also the cost of security, disposing of Ebola-contaminated trash and equipment to protect caregivers. \n \n \u201cIt is with profound sadness and heartfelt disappointment that we must inform you of the death of Thomas Eric Duncan this morning at 7:51 a.m.,\u201d Texas Health Presbyterian said today in a statement. \n \n The Ebola Scourge \n \n The bill for Duncan\u2019s care may eventually total $500,000 including indirect costs such as the disruption to other areas of the hospital, said Dan Mendelson, chief executive officer of Avalere Health, a Washington consulting firm. Duncan\u2019s care probably cost $18,000 to $24,000 a day, said Gerard Anderson, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Bloomberg School of Public Health. \n \n Photographer: Mike Stone/Getty Images Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas on Sept. 30 in Dallas.

He had no health insurance to pay for his care, said the Reverend Jesse Jackson, the civil rights advocate, who traveled to Dallas at the request of Duncan\u2019s mother. \n \n Spokesmen for Texas Health Presbyterian and for the Liberian embassy in Washington declined to discuss who would pay for Duncan\u2019s care. \n \n Related: \n \n Duncan is the first case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S. Emory University Hospital in Atlanta and Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha have also treated Ebola patients, three of whom have been released after recovering. A fourth patient is under care in Omaha and a fifth in Atlanta. \n \n Neither of the hospitals would comment on the cost of treating those patients. Kent Brantly, the first person to be transported from Liberia to the U.S. for care, was covered under health insurance provided by his charity, Samaritan\u2019s Purse, said Todd Shearer, a spokesman for the group. \n \n Photographer: Joe Raedle/Getty Images Civil rights advocate Reverend Jesse Jackson, right, walks with Nowai korkoyah, the mother of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan, after speaking to the media at the South Dallas Cafe on October 7, 2014 in Dallas, Texas.

They are covered by the group\u2019s health and workers\u2019 compensation insurance plans, and SIM plans to pay their $25,000 deductibles, said George Salloum, the group\u2019s vice president for finance and operations. Writebol\u2019s evacuation from Liberia was covered in full by one of SIM\u2019s insurance carriers, Aetna Inc. (AET), he said. He\u2019s still waiting for bills from other carriers, whom he declined to name, and said he didn\u2019t know what the hospital care cost. \n \n \u201cThe hospitals have not disclosed that information to us,\u201d Salloum said in a phone interview. \u201cI\u2019m very anxious to find out, personally, just wondering what they\u2019re charging for that kind of care.\u201d \n \n Emory and Nebraska are known for their expertise in exotic diseases and careful isolation of infectious patients. Texas Health Presbyterian has no such pedigree. \n \n Hospital Rank \n \n It is ranked the fifth-best hospital in the Dallas-Fort Worth region and 15th-best in Texas by U.S. News and World Report. Duncan arrived there in an ambulance on Sept. 28, after being initially sent home two days earlier from the emergency room with antibiotics. The hospital has blamed a communication failure in its electronic record system for Duncan\u2019s initial release. \n \n \u201cThey have an excellent reputation in the community\u201d and \u201cvery good infectious disease physicians,\u201d Stephen Love, president and CEO of the Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council, a trade group, said in a phone interview. \n \n Anderson, who is a former federal health official, said that as a foreign citizen Duncan wouldn\u2019t have been eligible for any U.S. health programs such as Medicaid, for low income people. Texas hospitals charge $8,176 per day on average for treatment of viral illnesses, including exotic diseases such as West Nile virus and Dengue fever, said Andrew Fitch, a health-care pricing expert at NerdWallet, a San Francisco-based company that provides consumer finance and health data. \n \n That figure \u201cis actually probably on the low end\u201d for Ebola, Fitch said in a phone interview. \u201cThe isolation ward would bump up the charge a lot.\u201d \n \n Area Costs \n \n Health care generally is more costly in Dallas than in the rest of the country, according to the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, a project of Dartmouth University that tracks regional variation in spending by Medicare, the U.S. health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. Medicare beneficiaries in Dallas cost about $11,484 on average in 2012, placing the area within the 90th percentile for the U.S. \n \n Isolation procedures can include placing patients by themselves in rooms capable of negative air pressure, to prevent microorganisms from escaping, said Pritish Tosh, an infectious diseases physician and researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Physicians and nurses treating the patients must don gloves, gowns and masks with eye protection before entering the room and dispose of the gear afterward, he said. \n \n Intensive Care \n \n That can roughly double the cost of standard treatment in an intensive care unit, Anderson said. If a U.S. outbreak occurs, something federal health officials say is unlikely, the cost of care may fall as hospitals gain experience and streamline procedures, said Jeffrey Rice, CEO of Healthcare BlueBook Inc., a Brentwood, Tennessee, company that calculates health-care prices for consumers. \n \n There is no approved cure for Ebola, though some patients have received experimental medications. Standard treatment includes supportive care to maintain body fluids, replace blood and fight off opportunistic infections. \n \n The Ebola outbreak originated in West Africa, where it has infected 8,033 people, killing 3,879, primarily in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, according to a report today from the World Health Organization. \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Alex Wayne in Washington at awayne3@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editors responsible for this story: Reg Gale at rgale5@bloomberg.net Andrew Pollack ||||| DALLAS (AP) \u2014 The Fort Worth, Texas, company Cleaning Guys has dealt with hazardous spills.

(Associated Press) \n \n But Garrett Eison, the company's operations manager, said he was initially anxious when the company agreed to take on a job others were hesitant to do: cleaning up the Dallas apartment where an Ebola patient stayed. \n \n \"This is definitely something that would make you a little more nervous,\" Eison said, though he added that because he knew his company was prepared, \"I don't feel worried about it.\" \n \n Eison was part of a 15-member crew that spent four days at the apartment where Thomas Eric Duncan stayed when he began showing Ebola-related symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. They wore protective suits with gas masks as they filled about 140 barrels with items from the home for incineration, including mattresses, the patient's sheets and the entire apartment's carpet. \n \n By the end, logos on the company's black and green trailers \u2014 televised nationwide by media camped outside the home \u2014 became a recognizable brand across Dallas, where Eison's colleagues have been approached in public and thanked. \n \n The job wasn't easy to fill. At a briefing last week, Texas Health Commissioner David Lakey said that \"there's been a little bit of hesitancy for entities to want to do that.\" A Dallas County spokeswoman said Tuesday that the county contacted seven vendors for the task and that \"the only vendor that was responsive and met the guidelines\" for that kind of waste disposal was the Cleaning Guys. \n \n Duncan arrived in Dallas last month from Ebola-ravaged Liberia and stayed in the apartment with Louise Troh, her 13-year-old son and two nephews until he developed symptoms several days later and was eventually hospitalized. The family was moved to an undisclosed location on Friday, the day the cleanup started. They have not yet shown symptoms. \n \n For the next several days, the crew cleared out the place, including a 26-hour final stretch lasting into Monday. The job required rotating two-person teams after they'd worked for 40 minutes to avoid exhaustion. They disposed of most of the family's belongings but were able to set aside items such as passports, a laptop, a family Bible, trophies, photographs and other keepsakes. \n \n Company owner Erick McCallum said that for the job they set up a \"little city\" outside the apartment that included food, portable toilets and a place for workers to rest. They also made sure workers were properly hydrated and had their blood pressure under control. \n \n McCallum said his crew didn't have any specific training for Ebola, which is spread by contact with bodily fluids and has killed more than 3,400 people in West Africa. But he noted his company's previous work prepared them for what he calls his business' most high-profile job. \n \n The workers consulted with Dallas County and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to ensure everyone was safe. \n \n \"It comes down to biohazard training,\" he said. \"The steps and precautions taken are basically the same.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Diana Heidgerd and Emily Schmall contributed to this report.",

Care for Liberian national Thomas Duncan, who is in critical condition at a Dallas hospital, is costing up to $1,000 an hour, and analysts believe the bill could total more than $500,000, including costs like security and decontamination. Duncan\u2014who will also face criminal charges if he pulls through\u2014has no health insurance, and it's not clear if the bill will ever be paid. \"It's too early to make a decision about payment of bills; he is in critical condition,\" a Liberian Embassy spokesman says. \"The focus is on his health.\" More: Duncan, 42, is receiving an experimental drug, and health officials say there have been a few positive signs: He's still on dialysis, but his blood pressure and temperature are now normal, reports the New York Times. None of the 48 people under observation who came into contact with him are showing Ebola symptoms. But with the incubation deadline days away, Dallas is on edge, reports the AP. \"This is a very critical week,\" says Texas Health Commissioner David Lakey. \"We're at a very sensitive period when a contact could develop symptoms. We're monitoring with extreme vigilance.\" Before he became unresponsive, Duncan apologized to his fiancee and told her he would have \"preferred to stay in Liberia and died than bring this to you,\" a family friend tells the Washington Post. The friend says he told her, \"I'm so sorry all of this is happening ... I would not put the love of my life in danger.\" Duncan's relatives have been able to view him via a video system, but they decided not to during a hospital visit yesterday because earlier images had been too disturbing. \"What we saw was very painful. It didn't look good,\" a nephew tells the AP. A fascinating read: How Firestone shut down Ebola.",
