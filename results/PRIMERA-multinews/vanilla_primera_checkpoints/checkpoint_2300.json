Gardiner says there are three Amish communities in that area. The detective believes it would be a great place for someone to hide out. He says Maine State Police have been checking in to the communities. ||||| Please enable Javascript to watch this video \n \n LAPEER, Mich. \u2014 While a manhunt stretching from Michigan to Maine reaches the 10 month mark, the daughter of the woman Harold 'Butch' Knight is suspected of strangling to death in January thinks he's hiding out much closer than anyone realizes. \n \n Roxanne Cameron-Harris, Sara Knight's daughter, said she believes her stepfather 'Butch' is playing a calculated game in the time he's been on the run from authorities following the 911 call he made confessing to the murder of his wife. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s never a coincidence with Butch, I\u2019ve noticed that,\" she told FOX 17. \"There\u2019s always a reason for anything.\" \n \n >> Watch: The hunt for Harold 'Butch' Knight was recently featured on 'Crime Watch Daily' on FOX 17. \n \n Ten months ago, 'Butch' called 911, telling a dispatcher he'd strangled his wife in their Ganges Township home and asked authorities to come to the home to \"do whatever they do with dead bodies.\" \n \n It's a call forever etched into Cameron-Harris' mind once it was played back to her earlier this year. \n \n \u201cHearing the words that he said was\u2026 it like haunts me,\" she said. \"It\u2019s incredibly hard to hear someone you know talk about somebody like a piece of trash.\" \n \n The 911 call was placed Jan. 13, but authorities believe Sara was killed two days prior. 'Butch' became the prime suspect. \n \n Eluding police ever since, the 67 year old has changed his appearance, dying his mustache and has been spotted several times in Maine. Surveillance pictures spotted him in a Wal-Mart in Franklin County, Maine. It's the same store where it was later discovered he ditched his wife's vehicle before checking into a hotel in nearby Rangley. \n \n Authorities were even investigating whether Knight had gone into hiding in one of the Amish communities in Maine. At least three Amish communities are known to be in the Rangley area, investigators told FOX 17 in September. Family members tipped police off about Knight\u2019s curiosity in the Amish, but detectives also found books in Knight\u2019s pole barn that led them to believe it could be a possibility. \n \n Rangley is also familiar territory for 'Butch' who'd lived nearby with Sara for nearly a decade prior to the two moving back to Michigan in the summer of 2014. \n \n Cameron-Harris says it's no coincidence. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s very smart. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s doing this for a reason. We can\u2019t figure that part out, but how do you get from here to Maine and not have a single person see you,\" she questioned. \n \n In July, a relative of Sara Knight contacted authorities after noticing someone had 'liked' a post on Facebook using the deceased wife's account. Investigators later said it was highly probable the only person who likely had the password to the Facebook account was 'Butch.' \n \n Cameron-Harris tells FOX 17 not knowing where and when Knight will appear next has lead her family to live anxiously in fear because they believe he's not only still alive, but hiding nearby. \n \n \"I think this is some kind of sick game he\u2019s playing,\" Cameron-Harris said. \"For whatever reason he wants us to pay, and we\u2019ve paid dearly. It\u2019s time for this game to end.\u201d \n \n Police said they continue to receive tips from across the country, and take each one seriously. Authorities in Michigan also say they remain in constant contact with investigators in Maine where 'Butch' was last spotted. \n \n Authorities said Knight should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone with information on Knight's whereabouts is asked to contact the Allegan County Sheriff's Office at 269-673-0500. ||||| As Roxanne Cameron-Harris goes about her day Tuesday, her mother is never far from her mind. \n \n Sara Knight would have been 49 today, May 19. \n \n But instead of celebrating the day with her, Cameron-Harris, 29, is instead reflecting on years of memories and conversations they had before Knight's death in January. \n \n As one month has faded to the next, police continue to seek Knight's husband, Harold \"Butch\" Knight, as a suspect in her death, which is being investigated as a homicide. The case has been full of twists and turns. \n \n Allegan County dispatchers took a 911 call about 8 a.m. Jan. 13 from a man believed to be Butch Knight, who said he had harmed Sara Knight and she was dead in the couple's home south of Fennville. His family has identified him as the one who made the call, which originated in southeast Michigan, police said. \n \n Knight, 66, fled the state and remains on the run, police said. His vehicle was found abandoned in Franklin County, Maine, on January 16. A surveillance photo showed Knight with dyed black hair and a mustache, wearing camouflage clothing. \n \n Allegan County sheriff's Capt. Frank Baker said detectives remain in regular contact with FBI investigators working to locate Butch Knight, but have no new information on his whereabouts. \n \n That knowledge is tough for Cameron-Harris, who longs for closure. Knowing Butch Knight is hiding while holding the answers to so many questions she has about her mother, is a burden she carries daily. \n \n Cameron-Harris feels someone must be helping Butch Knight. She pleaded with that person to come forward. Police have said Knight is considered armed and dangerous. \n \n \"If they're helping him, their safety is at stake. What if he turns on them? He could snap at any time,\" Cameron-Harris said. \n \n She has told police one thing: \"Just bring him back alive.\" Cameron-Harris wants to see him face-to-face, wants him to understand her anguish. \n \n Sara Knight had recently completed a doctorate's degree in respiratory therapy. She had once taught college classes while living back in Maine and worked hard to help others, Cameron-Harris said. \n \n Sara Knight worked to provide for both herself and for Butch Knight and cared for him, Cameron-Harris said. Her mother had mentioned he had been noticeably quiet early this year, but she thought he may have been making plans for the couple's upcoming anniversary, Cameron-Harris said. The Knights had been married for 15 years. \n \n Cameron-Harris said she'll spend Tuesday evening with extended family, remembering her mother and sharing hope for the future. ||||| Justice For Sara Lee \n \n On January 11 2015 every one\u2019s life change. \n \n \n \n A woman with so much life was brutally murdered in cold blood by a man we all trusted.

The GoFundMe page has raised $50, but Cameron-Harris said she has personally received about $560 in checks. She hopes to raise $1,000 for the reward. \n \n The pink shirts reads, \"No evil goes unpunished... Justice for Sara Lee.\" \n \n \"I'm really trying anything. It's not gonna bring my mom back, but at least we can sleep at night,\" Cameron-Harris said. \n \n Police looked for Harold Knight in Maine last winter after a surveillance photo showed him wearing camouflage clothing with dyed black hair and a mustache. The couple met in Gladwin, where Sara Knight was raised, and lived in Maine before returning to Michigan. \n \n Harold Knight is wanted on an open murder charge. \n \n Cameron-Harris said she constantly worries about her stepfather's whereabouts. \n \n \"I don't think people take it so seriously how dangerous he is,\" she said. \"He just snapped one day and killed my mom.\" \n \n As the search approaches the one-year mark, Sara Knight's family plans to come together for a candlelight vigil Jan. 11, the day police said she died. They will gather in Gladwin. \n \n Cameron-Harris has sifted through her mother's belongings in search of any type of clue that could help investigators. The amount of tips that have turned out to be false leads has been disappointing. The biggest question left unanswered is why her mother was killed. \n \n \"There's no real clear reason why everything happened,\" Cameron-Harris said. \"I have love letters from the beginning all the way through her relationship from both of them. It was a real, true love story.\" \n \n Family believed Harold Knight had access to his wife's Facebook last spring when someone \"liked\" a relative's photo from her account. Police used the search warrant process to try to track an IP address, but Cameron-Harris said it was not successful. \n \n Harold Knight was a truck driver, so his stepdaughter thinks he could be anywhere in the country. She's convinced that somewhere, somebody with information will come forward. She thinks the reward could help. \n \n \"I really want to have my day to see face-to-face with him and to share what he's taken from us,\" Cameron-Harris said. \n \n Angie Jackson covers public safety and breaking news for MLive/The Grand Rapids Press.

Before his disappearance, Latulip had attempted suicide at least once, leading to fears he may have killed himself. Police officer Duane Gingerich, who investigated the disappearance, tells the Guelph Mercury that he's thrilled that Latulip has turned up alive. \"I had hopes that he was out there somewhere,\" he says. \"For us as investigators, this is great, this is awesome. It's satisfying because most of these cases don't turn out this way. You expect the worst when a person is missing for that period of time.\" A DNA test confirmed Latulip's identity and police say a reunion with his mother, who moved to Ottawa years ago, is being arranged.

(Associated Press) \n \n Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, right, bows to observers as he arrives at a polling station during the presidential election in Minsk, Belarus, Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015. A presidential election... (Associated Press) \n \n The authoritarian leader faced no serious competition in the election, which was boycotted by the opposition. \n \n Even before polls opened in the former Soviet republic, the Central Election Commission announced that 36 percent of the 7 million registered voters had cast their ballots during five days of early voting. By 4 p.m. (1300 GMT) on election day, the official turnout was nearly 75 percent, even though many polling stations in the capital and nearby villages were nearly empty. \n \n Opposition leaders denounced the early voting as an ideal instrument for falsifying the result. International observers also raised concerns. \n \n \"It is very unusual for us to find that a country has an election so many days,\" James Walsh, who heads the delegation from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly, told The Associated Press. \"Most democracies have a challenge in getting its citizens ... to come out and vote.\" \n \n Walsh said the observers have questions about the security of the ballot boxes, a concern also raised by the opposition. \n \n \"For five nights, no one was guarding the ballot boxes and the authorities could do anything they liked with them,\" said Anatoly Lebedko, the leader of the opposition United Civil Party. \n \n Lukashenko said it would be a bad sign if he received fewer votes than during the last election in 2010, when he won 79.65 percent. \n \n \"That would mean that people were beginning to move away and were dissatisfied with some of my policies,\" the president said after voting in Minsk, the Belarusian capital. \"Therefore for me it is very important: If Lukashenko wins, that I retain what was there in the past election.\" \n \n Lukashenko, 61, appeared at the polling station with his 11-year-old son, Nikolai, who was wearing the same suit and tie as his father. \n \n An independent institute of socio-economic and political research put Lukashenko's support at about 46 percent in September, while the official state sociology institute tallied his support at 76 percent. \n \n Lukashenko faced three nominal rivals in the election: the leaders of two pro-government parties, Sergei Gaidukevich and Nikolai Ulakhovich, and little known opposition activist Tatyana Korotkevich. Prominent opposition figures either were barred from running or decided against trying to get on the ballot for an election they considered a farce. \n \n During his 21 years of rule, Lukashenko has cracked down on dissent while cultivating an image of a strong leader capable of guaranteeing order and stability. \n \n \"Oh, life has become harder, but Lukashenko promises stability and peace,\" said 68-year-old Tamara Krylovich after voting in Minsk. \"Look at what democracy brought in Ukraine \u2014 war and poverty.\" \n \n Lukashenko has largely preserved the state-controlled Soviet type of economy, albeit with the help of cheap Russian gas and Western loans. The unreformed economy may be sputtering, but it still puts bread on the tables of pensioners and workers at unprofitable state factories. \n \n But Anton Gurevich, a 41-year-old automobile factory worker, said it was time for a change. \n \n \"I have lived half of my life with Lukashenko, but life has not gotten better,\" he said. \"After all, the leadership should change, there should be changes.\" \n \n Lukashenko said he was prepared to introduce economic reforms if the Belarusian people were prepared for the difficulties they would bring. \n \n \"If you give me carte blanche for any destruction and any revolutionary transformations, if that is what you want, then for God's sake we will do it,\" he said. \"The issue is not me, the issue is society.\" \n \n Lukashenko had allowed opposition candidates to run in past presidential elections, although none of the votes was recognized in the West as free or fair. \n \n In 2010, most of the candidates who opposed him were arrested soon after the polls closed. Police also detained hundreds of opposition supporters while violently dispersing an election night protest that drew tens of thousands onto the street. \n \n One of the former candidates, Nikolai Statkevich, spent nearly five years in prison until Lukashenko unexpectedly pardoned him in August along with all five other remaining political prisoners. Their release was seen as an effort to improve relations with the West, which imposed sanctions on Belarus in response to the crackdown on dissent. \n \n On Friday, a European Union official said the EU may suspend its sanctions on Belarus. \n \n The opposition has called on its supporters to join a protest after polls close on Sunday night. The protest was expected to be relatively small and to be allowed to proceed peacefully. Police didn't interfere with an opposition demonstration on Saturday involving about 1,000 protesters. ||||| There are many dictators around the world who are well-known for their oppressive ruling of countries, such as Kim Jong Un. But there are many others that operate under the radar of the world media. They may not have a direct connection to the West or have a nuclear arsenal at their disposal, but their despotic actions need to be known. So we\u2019ve decided to put together a list of the worst of the worst. Six rulers who have been profiled on OZY and are among the cruelest, most corrupt despots around today. They may hail from countries as different as Eritrea and Laos, but what they share is a shocking disregard for human rights and seemingly unfettered power to persecute their own. \n \n You may not recognize the name, but this 77-year-old ruler of Uzbekistan has one of the most abysmal human rights records in the world today. For 24 years running, the Central Asian nation near the Caspian Sea has been terrorized by its own leader, who has killed thousands of unarmed protesters, forced children to work in slavelike conditions and imprisoned thousands for their religious beliefs. Karimov has even executed prisoners without a trial, according to our reporting, including boiling a couple to death. Read more here. \n \n Since taking over Gambia in a 1994 coup, President Jammeh \u2014 or \u201cHis Excellency,\u201d as he prefers to be called \u2014 has ruled the country with a lethal mix of fear, repression and murder. He\u2019s been know to fire into crowds of peaceful protesters, has imprisoned people for suspected witchcraft and, at one depressive point, demanded homosexual persons leave the country within 24 hours or face the possibility of being beheaded. Read more here. \n \n This 69-year-old has been the president of Eritrea since its 1991 independence, and yet not a single citizen has ever voted for him. And why would they? It\u2019s been 24 years of crushing despotism, where torture is routine, prisons are overstuffed and everyone from the age of 15 to 70 is forced into indefinite military service. Not only that, but Afwerki\u2019s administration has reportedly imprisoned thousands of people based on their political affiliations. Read more here. \n \n This guy is far from being a noble individual. Mswati has used his concentrated power in Swaziland, the last absolute monarchy in Africa, to feed his every despotic need. For one, he is reported to force young women to marry him whenever the spirit moves him (or about every two years), because polygamy is, no surprise, legal in Swaziland. He\u2019s also not really interested in democracy or feeding the poor or finding jobs for the 23 percent of the population that is currently unemployed. This despot, who became king at 18, has a total of 15 wives and an indefinite number of luxury cars. He may cut a cartoonish figure, but his corrupt ways are no laughing matter. Read more here. \n \n Condoleezza Rice has called him \u201cEurope\u2019s last dictator,\u201d and he\u2019s playing his role to the hilt. President of Belarus for more than two decades, Lukashenko has ruled the former Soviet state with an iron fist that would make the Kremlin proud. He censors the press, sends human rights activists to labor camps and gets rid of political rivals, either by throwing them in jail or, in the case of his former prime minister and head of the opposition, making them disappear. Read more here. \n \n The president of Laos may be 79 years old, wear spectacles and have thinning hair, but his mild appearance masks a tyrannical personality. Boasting a record of human rights violations as long as the Mekong River traversing this Southeast Asian country, Sayasone\u2019s government owns all newspapers, TV stations and radio stations, effectively snuffing all free expression. And if anyone manages to rise above these restrictions, they\u2019re bound to be imprisoned or even disappear. Read more here.",

    "document": "June 27, 2011 \n \n The purpose of this analysis is to shed light on the operation of the debt limit in case Congress does not raise the limit before the federal government runs short of cash and is no longer able to meet all of its obligations. \n \n In particular, we have addressed three questions: \n \n What is the date past which the government will be unable to honor all obligations? If that date is passed without a debt limit increase, what will be the effect on federal spending? If that date is passed without a debt limit increase, what are the potential consequences in the market for Treasury securities, as well as in other markets and in the broader economy? \n \n Please note that the analysis has been updated to reflect recent Treasury data. The daily outlook has been extended through the end of August and a new \"layers of defense\" slide has been added. Additional information about August securities has also been updated. \n \n Read in your web browser below: \n \n Try It Yourself \n \n The federal government has an estimated $306.7 billion in payment obligations for August 2011 after the 2nd of the month. The U.S. will take in $172.4 billion in revenue from August 3 to 31, 2011. Check out the following tools to make the difficult choices that would prioritize programs and balance the books: \n \n News \n \n Attached files \n \n Report, Economic Policy Project ||||| What happens if President Obama and Congress don\u2019t strike a debt deal? \n \n On Aug. 3, the nation would find out, with Obama forced to make a set of extraordinarily difficult choices about what to pay or not pay. By then, the government\u2019s savings account would be nearly empty and the president would be relying on daily tax revenue to pay the nation\u2019s bills. \n \n There wouldn\u2019t be enough \u2014 in fact, there would be a $134 billion shortfall in August alone. \n \n As Obama decided what to pay, he would choose among Social Security checks, salaries for members of the military and veterans, unemployment benefits, student loans, and many other government programs, according to administration officials and an independent analysis by a former senior Treasury Department official in the George H.W. Bush administration. \n \n To protect the nation\u2019s creditworthiness, Obama would have to balance those priorities with the imperative of making payments to investors in U.S. government bonds \u2014 ranging from domestic pension funds to the Chinese government. \n \n \u201cYou can move the chess pieces around all you want,\u201d said Jay Powell, a visiting scholar at the Bipartisan Policy Center and an author of the analysis. \u201cYou\u2019re going to lose.\u201d \n \n For months, the president has been pressing Congress to raise the federal limit on borrowing, now at $14.3 trillion. Members of both parties have balked, saying they first want a plan to tame the growth of the debt. \n \n On Wednesday, with negotiations over raising the debt ceiling hung up, Moody\u2019s said it might downgrade the U.S. government\u2019s top-of-the-line credit rating, which helps keep U.S. bonds the global gold standard, \u201cgiven the rising possibility that the statutory debt limit will not be raised on a timely basis, leading to a default.\u201d \n \n Obama says he must reach an agreement by July 22 to get legislation through Congress and meet an Aug. 2 deadline, after which the Treasury Department projects it will no longer have enough money to pay for all U.S. obligations. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has warned that a default would deal a severe blow to the economy. \n \n Some skeptics in Congress and conservative economists say that Obama has overstated the risk of not raising the debt ceiling and that tax revenue could pay for up to 60 percent of government operations. \n \n \u201cYou do not have to default and you don\u2019t have to shut down the government if you choose not to,\u201d said Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland. If Congress raises the debt ceiling without a long-term plan for reducing the federal deficit, he added, \u201cthey\u2019ll never solve the problem, and we\u2019ll end up like Greece.\u201d \n \n Obama\u2019s advisers have said that prioritizing some payments over others is impractical and would be chaotic. Money comes in and flows out at an inconsistent rate. \n \n \u201cYou would have to make heinous choices about which bills you would pay,\u201d White House press secretary Jay Carney said Wednesday. \n \n On Wednesday night, several Republican leaders were briefed on the Bipartisan Policy Center report as concern grew in the party about the potential impact of not raising the debt ceiling. \n \n According to the center\u2019s analysis, the government would have to cut 44 percent of spending immediately. Through August, the government could afford Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, defense contracts, unemployment insurance and payments to bondholders. \n \n But then it would have to eliminate all other federal spending, including pay for veterans, members of the armed services and civil servants, as well as funding for Pell grants, special-education programs, the federal courts, law enforcement, national nuclear programs and housing assistance. \n \n After the debt ceiling was breached, there would be no delay in the tough decisions. \n \n On Aug. 3, the Treasury is set to receive about $12 billion in tax revenue \u2014 mainly from people paying their taxes late \u2014 and is slated to spend $32 billion, including sending out more than 25 million Social Security and disability checks at a cost of $23 billion, according to Powell\u2019s analysis. \n \n Obama could decide to pay half of the Social Security checks and ignore other bills coming due that day, which include $500 million in federal salaries and $1.4 billion in payments to defense contractors. \n \n Or he could decide not to make any Social Security payments and instead hoard tax revenues to pay investors in U.S. bonds. A failure to pay those investors would severely destabilize the financial system, analysts say. (Some also argue that the Treasury could engage in a never-before-tried swap of government bonds that would allow it to pay for Social Security. But Treasury officials say it is highly unlikely to work and may not be legal.) \n \n Aug. 4 could prove even more difficult. The government is slated to spend $10 billion and raise only $4 billion in revenue. \n \n More worrisome for government officials is the $100 billion in Treasury bonds that come due on Aug. 4 and must be paid off. Ordinarily, Treasury would pay off those bonds and issue new bonds. \n \n But if the debt ceiling isn\u2019t increased, Treasury could run into trouble \u201crolling over\u201d this debt. Ratings agencies are threatening to downgrade U.S. bonds if the debt ceiling isn\u2019t raised. If the bonds are downgraded, many investors \u2014 such as retirement funds \u2014 can\u2019t buy them. \n \n As a result, there could be far fewer buyers of Treasury bonds and the U.S. government would have to pay much higher interest rates. \n \n Government officials and analysts say a spike in rates would dramatically increase the cost of funding the government and lead to far higher interest rates on mortgages, credit cards and other types of debt.",

    "document": "Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder and CEO of yelp Inc., San Francisco, California, testifies before a Senate Judiciary Subcommittee hearing called ''The Power of Google: Serving Consumers or Threatening Competition?'' on Capitol Hill, September 21, 2011. \n \n (Reuters) - Consumer review website Yelp Inc made a sparkling market debut on Friday, buoyed by optimism ahead of Facebook's public listing and hopes for further successful public listings by Internet companies down the road. \n \n Yelp's stock closed 64 percent higher at $24.58, a day after Yelp priced its IPO at $15 a share - above its indicated range of $12 to $14. \n \n At Friday's closing price, the company is worth about $1.47 billion - about 17 times its 2011 revenue. \n \n \"If you look at it, there's been a very high trading volume, much higher than normal,\" said Scott Rostan, a former Merrill Lynch analyst who founded Training The Street, an investment banking school in New York. \n \n Yelp could be benefitting from the optimism about Facebook's upcoming IPO, he added. \"Investors are getting a little excited; there's a social media momentum.\" \n \n Yelp's stellar debut follows those of other Internet sensations like LinkedIn Corp, Groupon Inc and Zillow Inc. But while those stocks made large first-day gains, they have since declined. \n \n Groupon stock's soared as much as 56 percent on its opening day, but has since fallen below its offer price of $20. \n \n Like Yelp, Groupon is losing money. Yelp generates revenue by selling advertising on its sites, where it has more than 25 million reviews of a range of local businesses and services - from plumbers and shoe-repair shops to restaurants and nightlife options. \n \n Yelp also competes with Angie's List, which unlike Yelp charges for memberships and whose stock fell 5.4 percent on Friday. \n \n \"Angie's List charges for memberships. That will prevent growth. It can maybe grow to 2 million memberships, but there's a finite number of people who want to pay to access this content,\" Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley & Co, said. \n \n \"Their unique visitor growth accelerated in the past year and they are forecasting solid growth over the next few years,\" Sinha said. \n \n The company, however, faces stiff competition from Facebook; Google Inc, through its recent buy of restaurant reviewer Zagat; and others like Groupon and Angie's List. \n \n Stoppelman told CNBC that he was not fazed by competition from the likes of Google. \n \n \"That's a potentially lucrative market, which could be interesting for some big companies such as Google, Facebook to muscle in,\" Rostan said. \n \n \"It could make Yelp a takeover candidate. As a public company it is a little harder to turn down an offer and it could be a $2 billion morsel for an established company to enter that market,\" he said. \n \n According to media reports, Yelp has rejected approaches by Google and Yahoo in the past. \n \n AMAZON OF LOCAL ADVERTISING \n \n The San Francisco-based company was started eight years ago in 2004 by former PayPal engineers Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons, when Stoppelman needed a doctor and online searches turned up only generic lists on health insurance websites. \n \n Stoppelman, a computer engineer by training, told CNBC he wanted his company to become the Amazon.com Inc of local advertising. \n \n \"We're just scratching the surface of local advertising,\" Stoppelman said. \"It's an enormous market.\" \n \n Yelp had 66 million unique visitors and was used in 5.7 million unique mobile devices on a monthly average basis in its latest quarter. It was active in 46 markets in the United States and 25 internationally at the end of last year. \n \n But the company has incurred losses since inception, and had an accumulated debt of about $41.2 million as of December 31. \n \n In 2011, Yelp recorded a loss of about $17 million but saw revenue jump 74 percent to $83.3 million. \n \n Like a slew of recent tech and Internet offerings and the upcoming Facebook IPO, Yelp will have two classes of stock - class A shares worth one vote each and class B shares with 10 votes each. \n \n This structure is seen by many as a method to keep voting power restricted to the major stockholders as the outstanding class B common stock will represent about 98.7 percent of voting power following the offering. \n \n Scott said this may be the time for more Internet companies to seek a public listing. \n \n \"In the IPO market there's a window of opportunity, when it's open you better rush through it before it closes,\" Rostan said, adding that LinkedIn's IPO in May last year created a window until about August. \n \n \"There needs to be some kind of event to open it (the window) and Facebook might be that event,\" he added. \n \n B. Riley's Sinha noted that Yelp was a good investment ahead of Facebook. \n \n \"In general, crowd sourcing, social and mobile are the key buzz words for investors and Yelp hits them all. Before Facebook comes along, this is a good social and mobile play for investors,\" Sinha said. \n \n Goldman Sachs is the lead bookrunning manager for the offering, while Citigroup and Jefferies acted as joint bookrunning managers. \n \n (Reporting by Aman Shah, Tanya Agrawal in Bangalore and Alistair Barr in San Francisco.; Editing by Supriya Kurane, Lisa Von Ahn and Richard Chang) ||||| Yelp's popular online reviews guide the hungry to the best restaurants, the thirsty to the friendliest bars and the flabby to the toughest personal trainers. But, on the eve of its initial public offering, the eight-year-old, still unprofitable company has yet to convince analysts of its long-term prospects. \n \n FILE - In this Oct. 26, 2011 file photo, the logo of the online reviews website Yelp is shown in neon on a wall at the company's new Manhattan offices in New York. Online reviews site Yelp is expected... (Associated Press) \n \n San Francisco-based Yelp Inc. late Thursday priced its initial public offering of stock at $15 a share. That's above its expected range of $12 and $14 per share. Yelp is selling 7.1 million shares, while its charitable foundation will sell 50,000. Investment bankers also have an option sell an another 1.07 million shares, depending on investor demand. \n \n The offering could raise as much as $123 million before expenses. It values Yelp at $900 million. \n \n That's a lot for a company that hasn't turned a profit since its 2004 founding. Rick Summer, an analyst at Morningstar, says that while Yelp is at \"the head of the pack\" compared to other review sites, he's concerned that businesses \"may not see enough value in (Yelp's) advertising platform to increase spending and justify the expected price of this IPO.\" \n \n Though it's best known for restaurant reviews, Yelp's users have reviewed churches, strip clubs, hospitals, hotels and high schools. The company makes money from advertising. Most of the ads come from the local businesses that its users review. In 2011, it booked revenue of $83.3 million, up 74 percent from 2010. It had a net income loss of $16.7 million last year and $9.6 million the year before. \n \n Like so many startups, Yelp originated as a solution to a problem. Jeremy Stoppelman co-founded Yelp with former PayPal colleague Russel Simmons. Stoppelman, who serves as the company's CEO, wrote about the Yelp's beginnings in an op-ed printed in the San Francisco Chronicle in January 2009: \n \n \"One day in the summer of 2004, I got sick and needed to see a doctor. I asked friends for referrals, but most of them were Bay Area transplants and didn't have any good recommendations. I searched on Google, but found only generic lists on health insurance Web sites. I wanted a doctor that fit my needs, not just any doctor,\" Stoppelman wrote. \"I wondered why it was so easy to find consumer reviews for products like books and electronics, but so hard to find good referrals for local service providers like doctors and plumbers.\" \n \n That's where Yelp came in. By 2009, Yelp had grown to 17 million monthly users and 4.5 million reviews. It has expanded overseas, to the U.K., Ireland, France, Germany and beyond. \n \n Yelp.com attracts 66 million monthly unique visitors and is home to 25 million reviews as of the end of 2011, according to its regulatory filings. People used the company's mobile application, meanwhile, on 5.7 million mobile devices a month, on average. That's an impressive run, but Summer is worried that Google and Facebook \"could grab more of the local advertising pie\" and take business away from Yelp, constraining the company's potential growth and profitability. \n \n Foursquare is also edging in on Yelp's territory. The New York-based company best known for letting users check in to venues using their mobile phones, offers local recommendations and user tips on what to eat or do once you've checked in to a restaurant, store or other business. \n \n Even so, Yelp's stock will likely see a big jump on its first trading day, as investors who didn't get in at the pricing clamor to grab a share. That's what happened with LinkedIn Corp., the consumer reviews site Angie's List Inc. and others. Online deals company Groupon Inc. saw its stock jump 31 percent on its first trading day. On Thursday, though, Groupon's stock was trading slightly below its IPO price of $20. \n \n Francis Gaskins, president of IPOdesktop.com, expects Yelp's IPO to price above the expected range and thinks \"there will be a lot of happy users who don't know valuation metrics\" who will buy the stock on its first trading day. Even so, Gaskins says he's a \"little bit skeptical\" about Yelp's long-term prospects. \n \n \"Sooner or later people will be wanting them to make money,\" he said. \"They won't go away, it's not like the dot-com bust. (But) at some point in time, people are going to get tired of them losing money all the time.\" \n \n Nick Einhorn, research analyst at IPO investment advisory firm Renaissance Capital, thinks Yelp has done an \"impressive job so far\" in building up its user base and content. \n \n \"While it is still reasonably small from a revenue standpoint, the company is still in the relatively early stages of monetization _ a large percentage of its revenue comes from its 20 oldest markets, so it should be able to continue to grow strongly as it drives monetization in its other 51 markets,\" along with new ones, he said. \n \n Yelp's users are its bread and butter. They're the ones who write the reviews, see the ads and hopefully click on them. To ensure that they trust the site _ and keep using it _ Yelp has kept a sturdy wall between its advertisements and reviews. Businesses can't run ads to boost their ratings and ads are clearly marked. Still, Yelp has elicited complaints from businesses about the way it screens out fake or biased reviews. The company uses an automated program to weed out unreliable posts, such as those written by business owners about their own restaurants _ or a competitor's. Some merchants have complained that the program made legitimate reviews disappear. In 2010, Yelp responded by adding an option to let users see reviews that are filtered out. \n \n That said, most user reviews are positive. As of August 2011, 38 percent of the reviews on Yelp were five stars, the highest possible rating, and just 11 percent were one-star reviews. On Friday, investors will get a chance to give their own ratings on the company's business. \n \n Life as a public company will be a change of pace for Yelp. Its new status will invite scrutiny from investors, regulators and the public. The challenge will be to keep it all in perspective. \n \n \"Some companies feel that there is a lot of short-term focus,\" once they have gone public, said Gordon Tucker, the managing director of Protiviti, a company that helps businesses go public. \"The companies that are successful are able to keep the long-term focus in mind.\" ||||| NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Reviews site Yelp priced its initial public offering at $15 a share late Thursday, above the target set by the company. \n \n San Francisco-based Yelp said it was selling 7.1 million shares in the offering, so the company will raise about $106.5 million in the IPO. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Yelp said in its first IPO filing in November that it expected to raise $100 million. Last month, Yelp set a target range between $12 and $14 a share. \n \n An additional 50,000 shares are being sold by the Yelp Foundation. Underwriters led by Goldman Sachs (GS, Fortune 500) have the option of purchasing an additional 1,072,500 shares from the company. \n \n Founded in 2004, Yelp has developed an ubiquitous brand and amassed more than 18 million reviews of restaurants, salons, dentists and other businesses. Last quarter, about 66 million unique visitors went to Yelp's site on a monthly basis. \n \n Yelp will start trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, under the ticker \"YELP.\" Yelp's debut day comes almost exactly one month after Facebook filed for a $5 billion IPO. \n \n Unprofitable: Like many other tech companies testing the public markets in the past few months, Yelp isn't yet profitable. For the full year in 2011, Yelp had a net loss of $16.7 million on sales of $83.3 million. In 2010, Yelp lost $9.6 million on $47.7 million in revenue. \n \n Yelp's main revenue stream is selling advertising to local and national businesses. It also runs daily deals, but in August Yelp cut half its sales staff in that unit. \n \n Critics have questioned Yelp's high operating costs, as well as its ability to stay competitive in a field with a low barrier to entry. \n \n In fact, Yelp's initial filing revealed that Google (GOOG, Fortune 500), which is developing its own Yelp-like offerings and recently acquired restaurant guide Zagat, is a key traffic source -- which puts Yelp in a precarious position. \n \n Yelp itself indirectly addressed another potential problem for the company: the credibility and truthfulness of its reviews. \n \n In its initial filing back in November, Yelp said it had 22 million reviews on its site. But in an amended filing in February, the figure dropped to 18 million. That's because Yelp said it was \"filtering\" about 5 million reviews and had removed about 1.8 million reviews. \n \n Yelp filters or removes content when a review does not adhere to its terms of service. One example: a restaurant owner posting a 5-star review to boost her own company's rating. \n \n But investors may not be spooked by any of the potential problems, if the recent performances of other social media IPOs are any indication. Last year, several Internet companies went public despite questions about their business models. \n \n Another reviews site, the contractor-focused Angie's List (ANGI), shares jumped 33% when it started trading in August. It is still trading above its offering price. \n \n Social gaming company Zynga (ZNGA) raised $1 billion in December from its IPO. And although the stock had a lukewarm debut, the stock has recently picked up steam after reporting solid results and as investors realized how tied it is to Facebook. \n \n Business networking site LinkedIn (LNKD) has done well since going public last summer. The company has reported a profit in each quarter since its IPO. Shares have nearly doubled from their offering price. \n \n And shares of daily-deals site Groupon (GRPN) popped 31% in its November debut, despite criticism of unorthodox accounting measures that led to several downward revisions of its financials. \n \n But Groupon's stock has fallen this year after the company reported a fourth-quarter loss.",

It began in Oregon and gradually swept north up the coast, with reports of pyrosomes spotted as far north as Sitca, Alaska. \n \n \u201cThere were reports of some pyrosomoes in 2014, and a few more in 2015 but this year there has been an unprecedented, insane amount,\u201d says Blondheim. \n \n This summer was the first time she saw a real-life pyrosome in her many years of marine study. Her mentor, Rick Brodeur, a research biologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s north-west fisheries science center in Oregon, saw his first pyrosome only a couple of years ago, after a 30-year career in marine science. \n \n \u201cOn one of our cruises we saw 60,000 in five minutes and they were ripping apart our nets,\u201d said Blondheim. \u201cThey were glowing and floating on the surface, completely covering the sea\u201d \n \n Few marine scientists have seen pyrosomes in the flesh because during the day they stay in the depths, sometimes up to 700 metres under the surface and usually in the open sea. \n \n \n \n Dr Lisa-ann Gershwin, a marine biology expert, said \u201cgargantuan\u201d blooms of traditionally tropical pyrosomes had occurred in unlikely places before, including in the sub-Antarctic. \n \n \u201cBecause they aren\u2019t wanted, and people really aren\u2019t used to seeing them \u2013 they really do impact fisheries and catch a lot of attention,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the case of these pyrosomes, I don\u2019t think anyone is quite sure what has led to this bloom ... it is unusual. There is every possibility it is a natural phenomenon, but an abundance this gobsmackingly big also suggests there may be something behind it that is not natural in origin.\u201d \n \n Gershwin and Blondheim agreed it was worth exploring if the pyrosomes were expanding more quickly due to warming sea temperatures caused by climate change, but other options for the bloom included the animals\u2019 diet changing or unusual sea currents. \n \n \u201cOne of the things we are figuring out is have these guys been off the coast and we haven\u2019t seen them? Are they moving inshore for a different reason?\u201d said Blondheim. \n \n \n \n ||||| Rating is available when the video has been rented. \n \n This feature is not available right now.

But they\u2019re actually made up of hundreds of tiny animals knit together with tissue into a filter-feeding cylinder. \n \n Hilarie Sorensen/University of Oregon \n \n And they\u2019re everywhere, filling the waters off the West Coast all the way up to Alaska, and washing up on beaches. \n \n One research boat caught 60,000 of them in five minutes. They\u2019re so thick in Alaska that fishermen gave up on fishing because their hooks were coming up full of pyrosomes instead of salmon. \n \n Jennifer Fisher, a research assistant with Oregon State University\u2019s Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, makes regular research trips to monitor ocean conditions. She started seeing pyrosomes in her research net in February, and a GoPro camera on the net revealed an eerie underwater habitat filled with the pickle-shaped creatures. \n \n \u201cBasically as far as the eye can see: pyrosomes,\u201d she said. \u201cWe were dumbfounded.\u201d \n \n Pyrosomes are common in the tropics, where they can reach a length of 30 feet and often glow in the dark. That likely explains their name, which in Greek translates to \u201cfire body.\u201d According to Fisher, they do show up in the ocean off the Northwest from time to time \u2013 but never in these numbers. \n \n \u201cWhy they\u2019re here now is unknown at this point,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had warm ocean conditions over the past couple years, and something has brought them here. They\u2019re just flourishing. It\u2019s just very unusual to find them so close to shore, so evenly distributed, and so abundant.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s strange, researchers say, because the warm ocean water that has been hanging out off the West Coast since 2014 has dissipated this year. And the Pacific has had plenty of warm water events in the past without seeing massive blooms of pyrosomes. \n \n No one knows what the effects of the bloom will be, but scientists worry that if all the creatures die off at once they could sink to the seafloor and suck up all the oxygen as they\u2019re decomposing, creating a dead zone for marine life. \n \n Courtesy of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n \n Richard Brodeur, a research biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is leading an effort to collect live pyrosomes to study in his lab in Newport, Oregon. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re trying to learn as much as we can about these guys,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been working for a long time, and I\u2019ve never seen one until now. So, we\u2019re kind of catching up. \u2026 It\u2019s really a mystery to us why this is happening.\u201d \n \n He wants to look at how they feed, how they orient themselves vertically in the water, and their swimming speed. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re usually in the tropics farther off-shore,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople haven\u2019t done anything experimentally with these guys.\u201d \n \n Brodeur said the pyrosomes might be a lingering effect of the warm water \u201cblob\u201d that in 2015-16 brought in unusual marine life including a tropical sea snake and red crabs. Though water temperatures have dropped from previous years, he said, \u201cthey\u2019re still way above normal, and we\u2019re still getting unusual things going on.\u201d \n \n Fisher will continue to monitor for the pyrosomes, and she\u2019s interested to see how long they stick around. \n \n \u201cThey often bloom in large numbers and then conditions become unfavorable for them and they go away,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s when we might learn more about why they\u2019re here is when they leave looking at what conditions caused them to go.\u201d",

The ads spread polarizing views on topics such as immigration, race and gay rights, instead of backing a particular political candidate, it said. \n \n Trump makes policy pledge to senator investigating son's Russia meeting Read more \n \n Facebook announced the findings in a blogpost by its chief security officer, Alex Stamos, and said that it was cooperating with federal inquiries into influence operations during the 2016 presidential election. \n \n The company said it found no link to any presidential campaign. Three-quarters of the ads were national in scope, and the rest did not appear to reflect targeting of political swing states as voting neared. \n \n Facebook did not print the names of any of the suspended pages, but some of them included such words as \u201crefugee\u201d and \u201cpatriot\u201d. \n \n The findings buttress US intelligence agency conclusions that Russia was actively involved in shaping the election. \n \n Facebook previously published a white paper detailing well-funded and subtle techniques used by countries and organizations to spread misleading information for geopolitical goals. These efforts go well beyond \u201cfake news\u201d, the company said, and include content seeding, targeted data collection and fake accounts used to amplify one particular view, sow distrust in political institutions and spread confusion. \n \n The company said in April: \u201cWe have had to expand our security focus from traditional abusive behavior, such as account hacking, malware, spam and financial scams, to include more subtle and insidious forms of misuse, including attempts to manipulate civic discourse and deceive people.\u201d \n \n Facebook did not attribute the manipulation to any nation state, although it said that the company\u2019s investigation \u201cdoes not contradict\u201d the findings of a January report by the US director of national intelligence that outlined Russian involvement in the election. \n \n Even so, as recently as June, it told journalists that it had not found any evidence to date of Russian operatives buying election-related ads on its platform. \n \n A Facebook employee said on Wednesday there were unspecified connections between the divisive ads and a well-known Russian \u201ctroll factory\u201d in St Petersburg that publishes comments on social media. \n \n Beyond the issue ads, Facebook said it uncovered $50,000 more in overtly political advertising that might have links to Russia. Some of those ads were bought using the Russian language, even though they were displayed to users in English. \n \n West failing to tackle Russian hacking and fake news, says Latvia Read more \n \n Even if no laws were violated, the pages ran afoul of Facebook requirements for authenticity, setting up the suspensions. \n \n \u201cIn the past Facebook has taken the stance that it\u2019s a tech company and not a media company, but they have clearly moved into the media company category,\u201d said advertising veteran Mike Kelly, CEO of Kelly Newman Ventures and former president of AOL Media. \u201cThey have to up their game a bit.\u201d \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Mark Zuckerberg has said the idea that fake news on Facebook could influence an election is \u2018pretty crazy\u2019, but not everyone agrees. Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images \n \n Kelly suggests that the company should use its technology prowess to come up with \u201cnew ways to filter and assess accounts and advertisers\u201d. \n \n \n \n Facebook, which now has 2 billion monthly users, suspends more than 1 million accounts per day in its quest to keep spam, fraud and hate speech of its platform. \n \n \n \n More than $1bn was spent on digital political ads during the 2016 presidential campaign, 10,000 times the amount identified by Facebook\u2019s security team. \n \n Facebook has rejected the notion that fake news on Facebook influenced the outcome of the US election, with Mark Zuckerberg describing it as a \u201cpretty crazy idea\u201d. \n \n \u201cVoters make decisions based on their lived experience,\u201d he said in November. \n \n But Facebook\u2019s ad sales team tells a different story. It highlights how an \u201caudience-specific\u201d political campaign on Facebook was able to \u201csignificantly shift voter intent and increase favorability\u201d for US senate candidate Pat Toomey, contributing to his re-election. \n \n In other words: it is entirely possible to swing an election using Facebook advertising, but it doesn\u2019t seem like this Russian \u201cinfluence operation\u201d was effective. \n \n \u201cMaybe nothing happened this time, but it\u2019s a good warning to them that their [Facebook\u2019s] role in the media landscape has changed, especially given their scale, and with that comes a lot of new responsibility,\u201d said Kelly. \n \n \n \n ||||| Representatives of Facebook told congressional investigators Wednesday that the social network has discovered that it sold ads during the U.S. presidential campaign to a shadowy Russian company seeking to target voters, according to several people familiar with the company's findings. \n \n Facebook officials reported that they traced the ad sales, totaling $100,000, to a Russian \"troll farm\" with a history of pushing pro-Kremlin propaganda, these people said. \n \n A small portion of the ads, which began in the summer of 2015, directly named Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton, the people said, although they declined to say which candidate the ads favored. \n \n Most of the ads, according to a blog post published late Wednesday by Facebook's chief security officer, Alex Stamos, \"appeared to focus on amplifying divisive social and political messages across the ideological spectrum \u2014 touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to immigration to gun rights.\" \n \n The acknowledgment by Facebook comes as congressional investigators and special counsel Robert S. Mueller III are probing Russian interference in the U.S. election, including allegations that the Kremlin may have coordinated with the Trump campaign. \n \n The U.S. intelligence community concluded in January that Russia had interfered in the U.S. election to help elect Trump, including by using paid social media trolls to spread fake news intended to influence public opinion. \n \n Even though the ad spending from Russia is tiny relative to overall campaign costs, the report from Facebook that a Russian firm was able to target political messages is likely to fuel pointed questions from investigators about whether the Russians received guidance from people in the United States \u2014 a question some Democrats have been asking for months. \n \n Facebook reported in its blog post Wednesday that about one-quarter of the ads in question were \"geographically targeted,\" although company officials declined to provide specifics about what areas or demographic groups were the recipients. Of those targeted ads, the company said, more ran in 2015 than 2016. \n \n Rep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Wednesday that the disclosure by Facebook confirmed one of the ways Russia sought to interfere in U.S. politics and serves as a \"profound warning to us and others about future elections.\" \n \n \"This is a very significant set of data points produced by Facebook,\" Schiff said, adding: \"Left unanswered in what we received from Facebook \u2014 because it is beyond the scope of what they are able to determine \u2014 is whether there was any coordination between these social media trolls and the campaign. We have to get to the bottom of that.\" \n \n The House panel, whose staff investigators heard briefly from Facebook representatives behind closed doors Wednesday, will follow up with Facebook and other social media companies and platforms to see \"to what degree they are able to confirm similar metrics,\" Sciff said. \n \n An official familiar with Facebook's internal investigation said the company does not have the ability to determine whether the ads it sold represented any sort of coordination. \n \n The acknowledgment by Facebook follows months of criticism that the social media company served as a platform for the spread of false information before the November election. In a statement posted days after the election, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg promised to explore the issue but said that 99 percent of information found on Facebook is authentic and only \"a very small amount\" is fake or hoaxes. In December, however, the company announced that it would begin flagging articles that had been deemed false or fake, with the assistance of fact-checking organizations. \n \n Facebook discovered the Russian connection as part of an investigation that began this spring looking at purchasers of politically motivated ads, according to people familiar with the inquiry. It found that 3,300 ads had digital footprints that led to the Russian company. \n \n Facebook teams then discovered 470 suspicious and likely fraudulent Facebook accounts and pages that it believes operated out of Russia, had links to the company and were involved in promoting the ads. \n \n A Facebook official said \"there is evidence that some of the accounts are linked to a troll farm in St. Petersburg, referred to as the Internet Research Agency, though we have no way to independently confirm.\" The official declined to release any of the ads it traced to Russian companies or entities. \n \n \"Our data policy and federal law limit our ability to share user data and content, so we won't be releasing any ads,\" the official said. The official added that the ads \"were directed at people on Facebook who had expressed interest in subjects explored on those pages, such as LGBT community, black social issues, the Second Amendment and immigration.\" \n \n Clint Watts, a former FBI agent who has studied Russian online influence campaigns, said Wednesday that Facebook's report served as \"validation\" for findings by him and his researchers, who he said had spotted what they believed to be Russians posing as Americans to press political messages on Facebook as early as 2015. \n \n He said his analysis showed that Facebook ads in 2015 were largely concerned with divisive social messages and were used to identify other Facebook users most susceptible to messaging. Those users were then targeted with election-oriented ads in 2016, he said. \n \n \"We had these suspicions, but we could never see who was purchasing the accounts,\" said Watts, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \"Facebook's being brave. They probably could have buried this, and they did the right thing by coming forward.\" \n \n Stamos, the Facebook security chief, said the company is committed to continuing to protect the integrity of its site and improve its ability to track fraudulent accounts. He said Facebook has shut down the accounts that remained active. \n \n \"We know we have to stay vigilant to keep ahead of people who try to misuse our platform,\" he said. \n \n This year, Facebook announced technology improvements to detect fake accounts and more recently announced that it would no longer allow Facebook pages to advertise if they have a pattern of sharing false news stories. Over the past few months, Stamos said, the company has also taken action to block fake accounts tied to election meddling in France and Germany. \n \n The Internet Research Agency has received attention in the past for its activity. \n \n In 2013, hackers released internal company documents showing it employed 600 people across Russia. Ex-employees who have gone public with their experiences at the company in Internet postings and in media interviews have said their work entailed creating fake Twitter and Facebook accounts and using them to circulate pro-Kremlin propaganda. They said Internet Research Agency employees, for instance, spread derogatory information about Putin critic Boris Nemtsov in the days after his 2015 murder. \n \n In 2015, the New York Times Magazine reported that social media accounts linked to the Internet Research Agency had launched social media campaigns in the United States, including a sophisticated hoax that spread false news of a chemical leak in Louisiana in 2014, apparently to sow chaos and fear. \n \n In its unclassified report in January, the U.S. intelligence community concluded that the Internet Research Agency's \"likely financier\" is a \"close Putin ally with ties to Russian intelligence.\" \n \n In May, Time magazine reported that U.S. intelligence officials had discovered evidence that Russian agents had purchased ads on Facebook to target specific populations with propaganda. A Facebook spokesman told the magazine that the company had no evidence of such buys. \n \n Under federal law and Federal Election Commission regulations, both foreign nationals and foreign governments are prohibited from making contributions or spending money to influence a federal, state or local election in the United States. The ban includes independent expenditures made in connection with an election. \n \n Those banned from such spending include foreign citizens, foreign governments, foreign political parties, foreign corporations, foreign associations and foreign partnerships, according to the FEC.

Violators face civil penalties, as well as criminal prosecution, if they are found to have knowingly broken the law. \n \n Andrew Roth, Alice Crites, Matea Gold and Ashley Parker contributed to this report. ||||| SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc said on Wednesday it had found that an operation likely based in Russia spent $100,000 on thousands of U.S. ads promoting divisive social and political messages in a two-year-period through May. \n \n Facebook, the dominant social media network, said 3,000 ads and 470 \u201cinauthentic\u201d accounts and pages spread polarizing views on topics including immigration, race and gay rights. \n \n Another $50,000 was spent on 2,200 \u201cpotentially politically related\u201d ads, likely by Russians, Facebook said. \n \n U.S. election law bars foreign nationals and foreign entities from spending money to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. Non-U.S. citizens may generally advertise on issues. Other ads, such as those that mention a candidate but do not call for the candidate\u2019s election or defeat, fall into what lawyers have called a legal gray area. \n \n Facebook announced the findings in a blog post by its chief security officer, Alex Stamos, and said that it was cooperating with federal inquiries into influence operations during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. \n \n Facebook briefed members of both the Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees on Wednesday about the suspected Russia advertising, according to a congressional source familiar with the matter. Both committees are conducting probes into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, including potential collusion between the campaign of President Donald Trump and Moscow. \n \n Facebook also gave its findings to Robert Mueller, the special counsel in charge of investigating alleged Russian interference in last year\u2019s presidential election, a source familiar with the matter said. The company produced copies of advertisements as well as data about the buyers, the source said. \n \n Mueller\u2019s office declined to comment. \n \n Facebook said it found no link between the Russian-purchased advertising and any specific presidential campaign. The ads were mostly national in their focus and did not appear to reflect targeting of political swing-states, the company said. \n \n Even if no laws were violated, Facebook said the 470 accounts and pages associated with the ads ran afoul of the social network\u2019s requirements for authenticity and have since been suspended. \n \n Facebook did not print the names of any of the suspended pages, but some of them included such words as \u201crefugee\u201d and \u201cpatriot.\u201d \n \n More than $1 billion was spent on political ads during the 2016 presidential campaign, thousands of times more than the presumed Russian spending identified by Facebook\u2019s security team. \n \n FILE PHOTO - A 3D plastic representation of the Facebook logo is seen in this illustration photo May 13, 2015. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo \n \n But the findings buttress U.S. intelligence agency conclusions that Russia was actively involved in shaping the election. \n \n Facebook previously published a white paper on influence operations, including what it said were fake \u201camplifier\u201d accounts for propaganda, and said it was cracking down. \n \n As recently as June, Facebook told journalists that it had not found any evidence of Russian operatives buying election-related ads on its platform. \n \n \u201cTROLL FACTORY\u201d CONNECTION \n \n Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, called the Facebook report \u201cdeeply disturbing and yet fully consistent with the unclassified assessment of the intelligence community.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe are keenly interested in Russia\u2019s use of social media platforms, both the use of bots and trolls to spread disinformation and propaganda, including through the use of paid online advertising,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \n A Facebook employee said Wednesday that there were unspecified connections between the divisive issue ads and a well-known Russian \u201ctroll factory\u201d in St. Petersburg that publishes comments on social media. \n \n Ellen Weintraub, a member of the U.S. Federal Election Commission, said U.S. voters deserve to know where the ads are coming from and that the money behind them is legal. \n \n \u201cIt is unlawful for foreign nationals to be spending money in connection with any federal, state or local election, directly or indirectly,\u201d Weintraub said in a phone interview. \n \n She declined to comment on the Facebook ads, saying she could not discuss subjects that could come before the agency. \n \n Facebook declined to release the ads themselves, prompting a sharp rebuke on Twitter from Pierre Omidyar, the billionaire founder of First Look Media, a producer of feature and documentary films, television and podcasts. \n \n \u201cFacebook keeps the targeted political ads it publishes secret, emboldening criminals,\u201d wrote Omidyar, the eBay founder who also provided funding to launch media organization The Intercept. \u201cI don\u2019t see how that can possibly be legal.\u201d \n \n The Facebook logo is displayed on their website in an illustration photo taken in Bordeaux, France, February 1, 2017.

According to Reuters, the ads were linked to 470 \"inauthentic\" accounts and pages that have since been suspended. While Facebook isn't releasing the ads, the names of the suspended pages featured words like \"patriot\" and \"refugee,\" the Guardian reports. The Russian company linked to the ads has a history of spreading pro-Kremlin propaganda. Facebook said it also found $50,000 spent on 2,200 \"potentially politically related\" ads that may be tied to Russia. The company's findings are more evidence to back the conclusion of US intelligence agencies that Russia influenced the election.

    "document": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump's long-time confidant Keith Schiller privately testified that he rejected a Russian offer to send five women to then private-citizen Trump's hotel room during their 2013 trip to Moscow for the Miss Universe pageant, according to multiple sources from both political parties with direct knowledge of the testimony. \n \n Schiller, Trump's former bodyguard and personal aide, testified that he took the offer as a joke, two of the sources said. On their way up to Trump's hotel room that night, Schiller told the billionaire businessman about the offer and Trump laughed it off, Schiller told the House intelligence committee earlier this week. \n \n After several minutes outside of Trump's door, which was Schiller's practice as Trump's security chief, he said he left. \n \n Members of the committee raised the matter because of salacious allegations laid out in a dossier compiled by former British agent Christopher Steele, an opposition research document funded by Democrats detailing alleged ties between Trump and his associates with Russians. \n \n During this week's closed-door hearing, House lawmakers walked through a Daily Caller article, which raised some of the allegations about Trump's Moscow trip from the dossier and discussed an alternative story involving Schiller's role in rejecting the Russian offer of sending prostitutes to Trump's room. \n \n The dossier's claims about Trump's activities in Moscow are some of the most incendiary claims in the memos compiled by Steele, which claimed that Russia obtained \"kompromat,\" or dirt, on Trump to use as blackmail. Trump has long denounced the dossier and flatly denied its assertions. \n \n Stuart Sears, an attorney for Schiller, said the chairman and ranking member of the committee should investigate individuals leaking \"misleading versions\" of Schiller's testimony, calling the conduct \"indefensible\" and questioning the credibility of the House inquiry. \n \n \"We are appalled by the leaks that are coming from partisan insiders from the House Intelligence Committee,\" Sears said in a statement. \"It is outrageous that the very Committee that is conducting an investigation into leaks - purportedly in the public interest - is itself leaking information and defaming cooperative witnesses like Mr. Schiller.\" \n \n During the testimony with the House investigators, Schiller denied knowing about the salacious allegations contained in the dossier. He was also asked about a wide-range of issues, including meetings between Trump associates and Russians, and he denied having knowledge of many of those interactions, sources said. \n \n Moreover, he denied knowing about the deliberations around the firing of FBI Director James Comey, saying he was only called into deliver a letter with the news to the FBI. \n \n White House officials declined to comment. \n \n While Trump and the White House have long rejected the dossier as an attempt to discredit the presidency, the FBI has corroborated some information in the dossier and used it as justification to obtain a surveillance warrant on Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page, CNN has reported. \n \n But federal investigators have not verified the most salacious allegations regarding Trump's activities on his 2013 trip for the Miss Universe Pageant in Moscow. \n \n Schiller was asked about the Daily Caller article, and he confirmed a Russian made the offer to send the women to Trump's room which was raised around lunch-time, sources said. He was asked who made the offer, but he could not recall the identity of the individual, sources said. \n \n Multiple sources said the offer to send women to Trump's room came from a Russian who was accompanying Emin Agalarov, a pop star whose father is a billionaire oligarch close to Russian President Vladimir Putin and who worked with Trump to bring the pageant to Moscow. But Schiller said the offer did not come from Agalarov himself, the sources said, disputing the Daily Caller report on that matter. \n \n \"Emin has no knowledge of that ever happening,\" said Scott Balber, an attorney for Agalarov. \n \n Dossier subject of controversy \n \n Trump has vehemently denied the allegations in the dossier since it was made public in January. At a press conference weeks before taking office, Trump said that he tells his staff before overseas trips, including to Russia, to \"be very careful\" in their hotel rooms because \"you're gonna probably have cameras,\" and that they could end up on the news if they weren't cautious. \n \n Trump has also ramped up his attacks after it became public that the Hillary Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, through the law firm Perkins Coie, paid opposition research firm Fusion GPS to compile the material that led to the dossier. \n \n \"Clinton campaign & DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier. The victim here is the President,\" Trump tweeted last month. \n \n Yet before Trump was inaugurated, Comey briefed Trump and outgoing President Barack Obama about the existence of the dossier. \n \n Additionally, Comey testified that Trump personally denied to him, on two occasions, that he participated in the salacious activities alleged in the dossier. This all came before Trump fired Comey in May. \n \n \"The President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them,\" Comey said about a dinner with Trump in late January. \"He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didn't happen.\" \n \n Comey said Trump gave a more explicit denial in a March phone call. \"He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia,\" Comey testified. \n \n A fateful Moscow trip \n \n Investigators probing potential Russia collusion asked Schiller to detail what happened during the 2013 Moscow trip when Trump was in charge of the Miss Universe pageant there. \n \n Trump brought the pageant to Moscow with the help of Aras and Emin Agalarov, the Azerbaijani-Russian billionaire oligarch and his pop-star son. The November 2013 event was held at one of their properties in Moscow. \n \n Video obtained by CNN in July shows Trump, Schiller, the Agalarovs and music publicist Rob Goldstone attending a July 2013 dinner in Las Vegas. The day after that gathering, the Trump Organization announced it would bring Miss Universe to Moscow. In June 2016, Goldstone connected with the President's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., at the request of Aras Agalarov to set up the meeting at Trump Tower with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. \n \n Close confidant to Trump \n \n Schiller, who is one of Trump's closest confidants, left the White House in September after serving as director of Oval Office operations. \n \n As a longtime adviser to Trump, Schiller has been present for some of the most controversial moments of Trump's political career. \n \n Trump dispatched Schiller in May to hand-deliver a letter to the FBI headquarters informing Comey of his termination, although Comey was in Los Angeles at the time. \n \n UPDATE: This story has been updated with comment from Emin Agalarov's attorney. ||||| Keith Schiller, Donald Trump's longtime head of security, told congressional investigators that he rejected an offer to send five women to Trump\u2019s hotel room during a trip to Moscow ahead of the Miss Universe Pageant in 2013, sources tell ABC News. \n \n Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \n \n In a four hour-plus meeting with congressional investigators Tuesday, Schiller was questioned about the 2013 Moscow trip with Trump and the president's firing of former FBI Director James Comey. \n \n Sources say Schiller told Congress he believed the offer was a joke, and that he responded to the offer by saying Trump was \"not interested.\" \n \n He told Trump about the exchange several hours later and the two laughed about it, Schiller told investigators, according to sources familiar with the interview. \n \n After walking Trump to his hotel room, Schiller reportedly told investigators he stayed outside the door for several minutes \u2013 his standard practice as Trump's security guard \u2013 before heading to his own room. He said did not see anyone enter Trump\u2019s room. \n \n ABC News first reported on congressional investigators' interest in Schiller. A former New York city cop, Schiller has been at Donald Trump\u2019s side for years. \n \n Schiller, who left his role as Trump\u2019s director of Oval Office operations in September, hand-delivered Comey\u2019s termination letter to FBI headquarters in May. He told investigators he did not know anything about Trump\u2019s decision until he was asked to deliver the letter to the FBI. \n \n Schiller denied knowledge of the salacious allegations against Trump included in the unverified dossier produced by the investigative firm Fusion GPS, and did not provide investigators with many definitive answers about his time with Trump, according to several sources in the room for the interview. \n \n Trump has also denied those allegations himself, saying he knew there could be cameras hidden inside hotel rooms in Russia. \n \n \u201cI was in Russia years ago with the Miss Universe contest which did very well,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd I told many people, be careful because you don\u2019t want to see yourself on television, cameras all over the place.\u201d \n \n Schiller\u2019s attorney Stuart Sears declined to comment.",

    "document": "Mandela: the three syllables not only refer to the legendary anti-apartheid leader and former President of South Africa, but serve as a modern synonym for equality, freedom and revolution. Nelson Mandela's legacy continues to endure in hearts and history books, and his ideals will continue to serve as inspiration in popular music. \n \n Mandela's Death: Artists React on Twitter | Bono Pens Moving Essay \n \n Today (Dec. 5), the iconic figure died at 95 in his Johannesburg home with his family at his side. From Public Enemy to Youssou N'Dour to Santana to U2, some of music's biggest stars have tipped their caps to the revered statesman in their songs, albums and even poems. Check out these 10 particularly memorable musician tributes to Nelson Mandela: \n \n U2, \"Ordinary Love\" \n \n U2 made this heartfelt song for the newly released film \"Mandela: Long Walk To Freedom,\" a biopic on the man himself. When \"Ordinary Love\" dropped weeks ago, it was first new material from the rock band since 2010's \"Soon,\" premiered on the \"U2 360 at the Rose Bowl\" soundtrack. With lyrics like, \"We cannot reach any higher/ If we can't feel ordinary love,\" Bono tried to embody what Mandela stood for. \n \n Hugh Masekela, \"Mandela (Bring Him Back Home)\" \n \n Masekela, a Grammy-nominated jazz musician from South Africa, recorded this track in 1987, and sings that he \"wants to see him (Mandela) walking down the streets of South Africa tomorrow.\" \n \n The Special A.K.A., \"Free Nelson Mandela\" \n \n Unlike most protest songs, \"Free Nelson Mandela\" moves to a celebratory beat and a cheerful chorus -- but the message is still a plea for the imprisoned Mandela to be released. \"His body abused, but his mind still free\" is sung of Mandela, who had been serving 21 years in prison at the time the song was written. Produced by Elvis Costello, the single was performed on the \"Top of the Pops\" in 1984. \n \n Youssou N'Dour, \"Nelson Mandela\" \n \n N'Dour is one of Senegal's most famous cultural icons, and his genre-bending repertoire has found him collaborating with Peter Gabriel, Bruce Springsteen, and Wyclef Jean. In 1986, N'Dour released an album entitled \"Nelson Mandela,\" as a tribute to the future President of South Africa. \n \n Public Enemy, \"Prophets of Rage\" \n \n One of the most influential hip-hop groups in history, Public Enemy was never short on righteous political messages -- and it should be no surprise that one of their most iconic tracks name-checked Mandela. In \"Prophets of Rage,\" Chuck D raps \"We have a reason why to debate the hate,\" while Mandela is mentioned in the company of other prominent leaders in the anti-segregation movement. \n \n Santana, \"Mandela\" \n \n Unlike most tribute songs in pop, this1988 Carlos Santana cut was written as an instrumental, and was also performed at Mandela's 70th Birthday Celebration. The song obviously does not nod to Mandela explicitly, the unmistakable guitar tone and Latin percussion act as an enduring paean from the multi-platinum musician. \n \n Simple Minds, \"Mandela Day\" \n \n Simple Minds is best remembered for its 1985 hit \"Don't You (Forget About Me),\" which became a classic after it was used in the \"Brat Pack\" favorite \"The Breakfast Club.\" Three years later, the group performed this tribute track at Mandela's 70th Birthday Celebration at Wembley Stadium. The song served as a banner of hope as the band sang, \"The tears are flowing wipe them from your face I can feel his heartbeat moving deep inside.\" \n \n 2pac, \"Just a Breath of Freedom (4 Nelson Mandela)\" \n \n Tupac Shakur's poem acts as a letter of praise to Mandela for his decades of struggle in the name of equal rights. \"Held captive 4 your politics/ They wanted 2 break your soul/ They ordered the extermination of all minds they couldn't control,\" Pac writes about Mandela's journey. \n \n Tracy Chapman, \"Freedom Now\" \n \n Soon after Tracy Chapman rose to fame for her No. 1 self-titled album in 1988, she found herself writing and performing this Mandela protest song at his 70th Birthday Celebration. A constant spokeswoman for social change, Chapman's song speaks against a society that kills and destroys that which it doesn't understand. The most memorable verse from the track reads, \"Soon must come the day/ When the righteous have their way/ Unjustly tried are free/And people live in peace I say/ Give the man release/ Go on and set your conscience free/ Right the wrongs you made/ Even a fool can have his day.\" \n \n Johnny Clegg, \"Asimbonanga\" \n \n Written as a mix of Zulu and English, the title of this Mandela freedom track is Zulu for \"We have not seen him\"; at that point, no one had seen Mandela outside of prison for more than two decades. Hailing from South Africa, Clegg stirred up controversy for not only writing this protest hit, but for also having bandmates of different races during the days of Apartheid. In 1999, the band was joined onstage by Mandela during a performance of \"Asimbonanga.\" ||||| President Barack Obama Thursday eulogized Nelson Mandela as \u201ca man who took history in his hands and bent the arc of the moral universe toward justice.\u201d \n \n Obama, speaking shortly after South African President Jacob Zuma announced Mandela\u2019s death, called the man for so long known as Prisoner 46664 as \u201cone of the most influential, courageous and profoundly good human beings that any of us will share time with on this earth.\u201d \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Breaking news roundup \n \n \u201cWe will not likely see the likes of Nelson Mandela again \u2014 so it falls to us as best we can to forward the example that he set: to make decisions guided not by hate, but by love, to never discount the difference that one person can make, to strive for a future that is worthy of his sacrifice.\u201d \n \n (VIDEO: Nelson Mandela, a look back) \n \n The president is expected to travel to South Africa for the state funeral, which has not yet been scheduled.

But Obama visited Mandela\u2019s old cell at Robben Island and met with Mandela\u2019s family, and in a speech while in the country, praised the leader for showing \u201cus that one man\u2019s courage can move the world.\u201d \n \n Carrie Budoff Brown contributed. ||||| Counting himself among the millions influenced by Nelson Mandela, President Barack Obama on Thursday mourned the death of the anti-apartheid icon with whom he shares the distinction of being his nation's first black president. \n \n \"He no longer belongs to us.

He had spent much of the year in and out of the hospital, and his illness prevented a meeting with Obama when the U.S. president visited South Africa this summer. \n \n However, the former South African president's legacy hung over Obama's trip.

(Associated Press) \n \n Julie Ramirez, left, consoles her mother, Betty Ramirez during a court inquest into the police shooting of Richard Ramirez in Billings, Mont. on Tuesday, Jan. 6, 2015. The unarmed man killed by Billings... (Associated Press) \n \n The ruling came after Billings Police Officer Grant Morrison testified he feared for his life when he fired the three shots that killed 38-year-old Richard Ramirez. \n \n The five-year police veteran said he became convinced that Ramirez had a gun after the man reached for his waistband during their 30-second encounter last April in a high-crime area of Montana's most populous city. \n \n \"I knew in that moment, which later was determined to be untrue, but I knew in that moment that he was reaching for a gun,\" Morrison said. \"I couldn't take that risk. ... I wanted to see my son grow up.\" \n \n The seven-person jury deliberated about an hour before delivering its decision. \n \n Yellowstone County Attorney Scott Twito said he does not expect to file any charges given the jury's decision. \n \n Coroner's inquests are mandatory under Montana law whenever someone is killed by law enforcement or dies in custody. \n \n The inquest was held as police killings of unarmed suspects in Ferguson, Missouri and New York City have heightened scrutiny of law enforcement nationwide. \n \n Ramirez family members said they were disappointed by the ruling and intend to file a lawsuit against Morrison and the Billings Police Department alleging excessive use of force, said Julie Ramirez, a sister of Richard Ramirez. \n \n Billings Police Chief Rich St. John said it was the fifth officer-involved shooting in his eight years as head of the department. Each shooting was ruled to be justified, he said. \n \n \"That tells us we're doing the right thing in the right way,\" St. John said. \n \n Police video showed Morrison repeatedly ordered Ramirez and other occupants of the vehicle to raise their hands. Ramirez's actions were largely obscured in the video. But Morrison said Ramirez dropped his left hand to his side \u2014 out of the officer's view \u2014 and \"started to jiggle it up and down\" just before he was shot. \n \n Morrison shot and killed another man in 2013. He was cleared of any wrongdoing in that case. \n \n Ramirez's family wanted criminal charges against the officer and said Ramirez was a victim of racial profiling. \n \n Another sister, Renee Ramirez, criticized the inquest as one-sided. She said testimony that her brother was a drug user was irrelevant. \n \n All but three of the 15 people called to testify during the two-day inquest were from law enforcement. Several police officers spoke at length about their prior dealings with Ramirez and others in his family. \n \n \"I don't care what things my brother did in the past,\" Renee Ramirez said. \"What does that have to do with shooting my brother?\" \n \n Billings Police Detective Brad Tucker, who investigated the case, testified Tuesday that Ramirez might have been trying to stash something when he was shot. A small amount of methamphetamine and a syringe were later found near Ramirez's seat. \n \n An autopsy determined Ramirez had enough methamphetamine in his bloodstream at the time of the shooting to kill a person not accustomed to the drug, forensic pathologist Tom Bennett testified. \n \n Twito defended the proceedings as a fair presentation of the facts. \n \n \"The videos speak for themselves,\" he said. \n \n Morrison was placed on paid administrative leave immediately after the shooting and has since been assigned to a task force investigating prescription drug crimes, St. John said. ||||| Montana police officer Grant Morrison killed unarmed 38-year-old Richard Ramirez in April last year, when Mr Ramirez \u2013 high on methamphetamine at the time \u2013 reached for his waistband. \n \n In the video the police officer can be seen walking away from the scene of the incident towards a patrol car recently arrived at the scene. The car\u2019s dashcam is still running, capturing the events. \n \n As he reaches the vehicle, officer Morrison suddenly appears to collapse just off the screen prompting other officers nearby to run towards him. One can be heard urgently asking: \u201cAre you hurt?\u201d \n \n He is comforted by his fellow officers, who tell him: \u201cYou\u2019re ok, I got you,\u201d but officer Morrison can be heard sobbing and breathing heavily. \n \n In a shaking voice, officer Morrison can be heard to say: \u201cI thought he was going to pull a gun,\u201d before breaking down even further and placing his head into his hands and pounding the bonnet of the patrol car. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on,\u201d he says as he tries to reassures the officers comforting him. \n \n Eventually, he noticeably pulls himself together and leaves the view of the dashcam to return home. \n \n During a coroner\u2019s court testimony on Wednesday officer Morrison, an officer for five years, said: \"I knew in that moment, which later was determined to be untrue, but I knew in that moment that he was reaching for a gun\u201d. \n \n \"I couldn't take that risk...I wanted to see my son grow up.\" \n \n In another video shown to the court, officer Morrison can be heard asking the suspect to raise his hands six times before he opens fire, shooting into the vehicle containing the suspect three times. \n \n The video does not show the actions of Ramirez, who was sitting in the back of a car with two others in front, at the time of the shooting, the Mail Online reported. \n \n Officer Morrison claims that he saw Ramirez drop his left hand to his side \u2013 out of the officer\u2019s view \u2013 and then \u201cjiggle it up and down\u201d. \n \n Detective Brett Kruger, who investigated the shooting, testified that two cellophane bags containing a small amount of methamphetamine and a syringe were later found near where Ramirez had been sitting. \n \n He had two outstanding warrants at the time of the shooting. \n \n The court later found that officer Morrison, who was cleared of all wrongdoing in another shooting in 2013, was justified in his actions. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

The suspect, allegedly carrying a handgun, opened the door and got into the passenger seat. \n \n -- Dzhokhar followed in another vehicle. \n \n -- Under questioning by Tamerlan, Danny played up being Chinese and tried to humanize himself by talking about cell phones and family.

At his request, CBS News is concealing his identity and has altered his voice. \n \n \"I thought it was just a robbery, you know?\" Danny said. \"He took out his gun, pointed to me.

    "document": "Russia's Alexander Tretiakov won gold in the men's skeleton at Sochi - before being banned for life by the IOC \n \n XXIII Olympic Winter Games Venue: Pyeongchang, South Korea Dates: 9-25 February Coverage: Watch live on BBC TV, Red Button, Connected TVs, BBC Sport website and mobile app. \n \n A decision to overturn the Olympic life bans of 28 Russian athletes \"may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\", says the International Olympic Committee (IOC). \n \n The Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) overturned the IOC suspensions - for doping at the 2014 Winter Olympics - partially upholding 11 other appeals. \n \n Cas said that in 28 cases evidence was \"insufficient\" to prove doping. \n \n The IOC said it would consider its own appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal. \n \n Cas said that for the 11 athletes whose appeals had been partially upheld, evidence \"was sufficient to establish an anti-doping rule violation\" had taken place. \n \n It said they would be \"declared ineligible\" for this month's Games \"instead of a life ban from all Olympic Games\". \n \n The IOC said that the Cas ruling \"does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited\" to this month's Games in Pyeongchang. \n \n It expressed its \"satisfaction on one hand and disappointment on the other\" at Thursday's decision, made eight days before the 2018 Winter Olympics begin in South Korea. \n \n \"On the one hand, the confirmation of the anti-doping rule violations for 11 athletes because of the manipulation of their samples clearly demonstrates once more the existence of the systemic manipulation of the anti-doping system at Sochi 2014,\" a statement added. \n \n \"On the other hand, the IOC regrets very much that - according to the Cas press release - the panels did not take this proven existence of the systemic manipulation of the anti-doping system into consideration for the other 28 cases. \n \n \"This may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping. \n \n \"Therefore, the IOC will analyse the reasoned decisions very carefully once they are available and consider consequences, including an appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal.\" \n \n Britain in line for another bronze? \n \n The Cas decision makes it likely that Britain's four-man bobsleigh team from Sochi will be upgraded to a bronze medal. \n \n John James Jackson, Bruce Tasker, Stuart Benson and Joel Fearon finished fifth, but the IOC disqualified two Russian sleds who finished first and fourth following re-examination of the doping tests conducted at the time. \n \n Athletes from both Russian sleds were included in the 11 whose doping violations were confirmed by Cas. \n \n The IOC is yet to officially reallocate the medals from that event, but if confirmed it would raise Britain's medal count to five and make Sochi 2014 their most successful Winter Olympics. \n \n Jackson told BBC Sport: \"Do I feel like an Olympic bronze medallist? I think it's starting to sink in, but I think once we have the medal it will feel more real. \n \n \"It's been a long waiting game since the McLaren report came out to get to a decision. I wasn't expecting the final outcome of the 28 appeals being upheld, but always thought a life-time ban wouldn't be upheld either way.\" \n \n Analysis \n \n BBC sports editor Dan Roan \n \n Once again, just as in Rio two years ago, the Olympic movement is in chaos on the eve of its showpiece event. \n \n The IOC had already received huge criticism for banning Russia, but then allowing as many as 169 athletes to compete as neutrals, but with the word 'Russia' emblazoned on their kit. \n \n The Cas decision now means that the 28 Russian athletes who have had their bans overturned could take legal action against the IOC and fight to be allowed to join their compatriots in Pyeongchang, along with many others excluded from the Olympics, causing last-minute havoc. \n \n At a time when there are fresh concerns that the new-generation bottles used to collect samples could be tampered with, this will be seen as yet another blow for anti-doping, undermining the entire case built against Russia for state-sponsored doping, and fuelling those who portray the scandal as a Western conspiracy. \n \n However, many will wonder why the IOC issued these lifetime bans in the first place when legal precedent shows that such sanctions are always doomed to fail once appealed. \n \n 'A get out of jail free card' \n \n Cas said it considered testimony from experts including former Russian anti-doping official and whistleblower Dr Grigory Rodchenkov and Canadian lawyer Professor Richard McLaren, who authored a damning 2016 report into doping in Russia. \n \n A statement from Dr Rodchenkov's lawyers said: \"This panel's unfortunate decision provides a very small measure of punishment for some athletes but a complete 'get out of jail free card' for most. \n \n \"The Cas decision only emboldens cheaters, makes it harder for clean athletes to win, and provides yet another ill-gotten gain for the corrupt Russian doping system generally, and [President Vladimir] Putin specifically. \n \n \"Clean sport is dead. The Cas decision proves that certain countries can get away with anything and everything. Today's decision will forever stand as the low point in sports integrity.\" \n \n How many Russians were banned and why? \n \n Media playback is not supported on this device IOC president: An 'unprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympics' \n \n In total 43 Russians were banned for life from the Olympics following the conclusion of an IOC investigation into evidence of state-sponsored Russian doping at their home Games in Sochi in 2014. \n \n Bobsleigher Maxim Belugin was the only athlete not to lodge an appeal with Cas, while three other cases - biathletes Olga Zaytseva, Olga Vilukhina and Yana Romanova - have been \"suspended\". \n \n The IOC investigation - known as the Oswald Commission, tasked with looking into individual cases of doping - was opened following the findings of the McLaren report. \n \n The McLaren report said Russian athletes benefited from a state-sponsored doping programme between 2011 and 2015, speaking of \"a cover-up that evolved from uncontrolled chaos to an institutionalised and disciplined medal-winning conspiracy\". \n \n The IOC also set up another investigative body - the Schmid Commission - to investigate this wider evidence of institutional doping. \n \n As a result it banned Russia from competing in Pyeongchang, but 169 Russians have since been invited to take part as neutrals. \n \n 'A puzzle' and 'circumstantial evidence' \n \n In November, the IOC described the \"puzzle\" of investigating something that was \"by nature and purpose elusive\" as it published decisions explaining its first wave of Russian bans. \n \n With reference to Alexander Legkov, one of two Russian skiers banned on 1 November, the IOC said the athlete had \"sought to argue that no evidence could be drawn from the McLaren report\" but it had \"come to a different conclusion\". \n \n It said that the authority of the report's findings was \"unquestionable\" and it \"can and will rely\" on its findings. \n \n Legkov is one of the 28 athletes whose suspensions were overturned by Cas on Thursday. \n \n In the statement explaining its decision, Cas said its mandate \"was not to determine generally whether there was an organised scheme allowing the manipulation of doping control samples in the Sochi laboratory\". \n \n It said it was \"strictly limited to dealing with 39 individual cases and to assess the evidence applicable to each athlete on an individual basis\". \n \n Cas secretary general Matthieu Reeb said there was only \"circumstantial evidence\" that supported individual claims of doping. \n \n He added: \"It is a matter where there is no direct evidence, such as positive test or a voluntary admission. \n \n \"This does not mean that the 28 athletes are declared innocent, but due to insufficient evidence the appeals are upheld, the sanctions annulled and their results in Sochi are reinstated.\" \n \n 'We expect to compete' - reaction in Russia \n \n By BBC Monitoring \n \n Russian Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov said: \"Our guys and all of us are happy that justice has finally triumphed. Today's rulings confirm that many of those who were accused are clean athletes.\" \n \n The Interfax news agency quoted Russian Olympic Committee head Alexander Zhukov as saying: \"We are simply happy now that the court has restored the athletes' good name and returned their awards.\" \n \n Interfax also quoted Kolobkov as saying: \"The athletes who fought for their rights have finally won, and are, naturally, happy and looking forward to continuing their careers. \n \n \"They expect the International Olympics Committee to accept the Cas ruling and allow them unconditional rights to take part in the upcoming Olympic games.\" \n \n Alexander Zubkov, president of the Russian bobsleigh federation, Sochi gold medallist and one of 11 athletes confirmed to have committed a doping offence, told Reuters he was \"partly satisfied\" with the decision as \"a large number of athletes were exonerated\". \n \n But he was puzzled as to why he was not among them, adding: \"I have said many times that I have never doped and do not dope now. What am I being accused of? What anti-doping rule violation do they want to slap against me?\" ||||| The International Olympic Committee has reacted with dismay after 28 Russian athletes had their lifetime bans from the Olympics dramatically overturned by the court of arbitration for sport and warned that the ruling could have serious consequences for the fight against doping. \n \n As Russia\u2019s sports ministry celebrated the decision, saying that \u201cjustice had finally triumphed\u201d, the IOC was bracing itself for a fresh legal challenge from some of the athletes who now want to compete in the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang which begin next Friday. \n \n Russians hail 'triumph of justice' as IOC doping bans are overturned Read more \n \n Cas\u2019s ruling also means the 28 will have their results reinstated from the 2014 Winter Olympics, returning Russia to the top of the medal table. They include the skeleton medallists Alexander Tretyakov and Elena Nikitina, who have already indicated they want to compete in Pyeongchang. \n \n British IOC member Adam Pengilly said he was \u201cappalled and angry\u201d at the decision, adding that it was \u201ca desperate and dark day for sport, with cheats and thieves allowed to triumph.\u201d \n \n \n \n \u201cWe need to take a long, hard look at sport\u2019s leading administrators and sport\u2019s legal system when we see the greatest fraud at an Olympic Games and years of institutional doping conspiracy pass by with only minor punishment,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cToday I have found myself apologising to individual athletes who have had dreams, medals, money and most importantly, faith in sport, stolen from them. They now think that you are better off cheating or getting your nation to establish a doping system because even if it is discovered, the consequences are minimal. Or, if you don\u2019t want to cheat, avoid elite sport like the plague.\u201d \n \n \n \n The ROC remains suspended from Pyeongchang because of state-sponsored doping in Sochi. However, as things stand, around 160 Russians have been granted permission to compete as \u201cneutral\u201d athletes under the banner of Olympic Athlete from Russia after being cleared of doping by an IOC anti-doping panel. \n \n That figure could yet rise, although for now the IOC is insisting it will not automatically allow any of the Russians cleared by Cas late entry into the Games. \u201cThe result of the Cas decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cNot being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation.\u201d \n \n The IOC was also unusually critical of Cas\u2019s ruling, suggesting the court had not taken enough account of evidence of \u201cthe proven existence of the systematic manipulation of the anti-doping system\u201d at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. \n \n Quick guide Why were the Russia doping bans overturned? Show Hide Why did Cas overturn the lifetime Olympics bans on 28 Russians? It says there was \u201cinsufficient\u201d evidence to establish that an anti-doping rule violation had been committed in 28 of the 39 cases it investigated. But haven\u2019t the IOC banned the Russian Olympic Committee from the Winter Olympics for state sponsored doping in Sochi? Indeed. The Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov provided testimony and thousands of documents to support his claims, which were accepted by the IOC and the World Anti-Doping Agency. However Cas says it did not look at systematic doping \u2013 just the 39 appeals against lifetime bans from Russian athletes. What is the International Olympic Committee\u2019s reaction? It expressed surprise that Cas had used a higher standard of proof than in previous doping cases, and said the rulings damaged the fight against doping. What are the immediate consequences? The Sochi medal winners among the 28 \u201ccleared\u201d Russians get their medals back - returning Russia on top of the medal table. And in the longer term? As things stand, around 160 Russians have been granted permission to compete as neutral athletes under the banner of Olympic Athlete from Russia after being cleared of doping by an IOC anti-doping panel last week. However some of the 28 \u201ccleared\u201d athletes are preparing an appeal so that figure could rise. What is the IOC\u2019s response? Resistance - for now. The result of the Cas decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited,\u201d it said. Russia\u2019s lawyers may be able to barge the door open regardless. \n \n Much of the evidence was provided by Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Russian anti-doping, who detailed how he gave cocktails of banned steroids to athletes and then swapped tainted samples for clean urine on orders from Russian officials. \n \n His testimony \u2013 along with thousands of supporting documents and statements from other whistleblowers \u2013 led to the Russian Olympic Committee being suspended in December and 43 Russians being given life bans from the Olympics after an IOC investigation led by Denis Oswald. At the time the IOC president, Thomas Bach, called it an \u201cunprecedented attack on the integrity of the Olympic Games and sport\u201d. \n \n However, on Thursday Cas ruled there was insufficient evidence to prove beyond doubt the 28 Russians had each committed an anti-doping rule violation. \n \n \u201cThe Cas required an even higher threshold on the necessary evidence than the Oswald Commission and former Cas decisions,\u201d the IOC said in a statement. \u201cThis may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping.\u201d \n \n The news was also greeted with frustration by Jim Walden, the lawyer for Rodchenkov, who remains in hiding after fleeing Russia in 2015. \n \n \u201cDr Rodchenkov testified fully and credibly at Cas,\u201d he said. \u201cHis truth has been verified by forensic evidence, other whistleblowers and, more recently, recovery of the Moscow lab\u2019s secret database, showing thousands of dirty tests that were covered up. \n \n \u201cThis panel\u2019s unfortunate decision provides a very small measure of punishment for some athletes but a complete \u2018get out of jail free card\u2019 for most. Thus, the Cas decision only emboldens cheaters, makes it harder for clean athletes to win, and provides yet another ill-gotten gain for the corrupt Russian doping system generally, and [Vladimir] Putin specifically.\u201d \n \n Another 11 Russians were convicted of having committed anti-doping rule violations in Sochi by Cas but had their life bans cut to a ban from the Pyeongchang Games alone. Among them were members of the Russian four-man bobsleigh team that won medals in Sochi \u2013 meaning the GB team, which originally finished fifth, will be promoted into the bronze-medal position. \n \n Philippe B\u00e4rtsch, a lawyer for Russian athletes, said the high salt levels in the 11 athletes\u2019 samples were accepted as evidence of tampering. \n \n Of the 43 Russian athletes banned by the IOC Maxim Belugin, a bobsleigher, was the only one not to lodge an appeal with Cas. Three other cases \u2013 biathletes Olga Zaytseva, Olga Vilukhina and Yana Romanova \u2013 have yet to be heard. \n \n IOC accused of 'backroom deals' with Russia over doping scandal Read more \n \n Match TV, a Kremlin-funded sport channel, celebrated the court\u2019s decision by broadcasting in full the almost two-hour-long men\u2019s 50km freestyle cross-country skiing competition from the Sochi Olympics, in which Russia swept the podium. The TV channel also described the ruling as a \u201cbang on the nose\u201d for the IOC. \n \n In a statement explaining its decision Cas said its panels had looked at individual cases and not whether state-sponsored doping had taken place. ||||| Matthieu Reeb, CAS Secretary General, speaks during a press conference about Russian athletes who are challenging the decisions taken by the Disciplinary Commission of the International Olympic Committee...

    "document": "Meet \"Joe\" \n \n \n \n \"Joe\" is a baby dinosaur, measuring under 6 feet long and a year old when it died. Careful study reveals that \"Joe\" was a young Parasaurolophus--the iconic tube-crested dinosaur that lived in southern Utah over 75 million years ago. \n \n This website is a virtual museum exhibit, highlighting the story of \"Joe\" and what this fossil tells us about our planet's history. \n \n \"Joe\" is named in honor of Joe Augustyn, a long-time supporter of the museum whose family sponsored the preparation of the fossil skeleton. ||||| Kevin Terris discovered the skeleton of a baby dinosaur named Joe in 2009, when he was a high-school student. \n \n It's amazing enough that a 17-year-old high-school student was behind the discovery of the youngest fossil skeleton from a weird-looking breed of boneheaded dinosaur. But it's even more amazing that two professional paleontologists walked right past the bones before the kid spotted them. \n \n \"It's a little embarrassing to walk by something like that,\" admitted Andrew Farke, curator of the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology at The Webb Schools, \"but he was just in the right place at the right time, looking in the right direction.\" \n \n Farke and the California museum's director, Don Lofgren, had checked out the territory at the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah, and passed within several feet of the exposed fossil. A couple of days later, they brought their Webb students through the place for a field trip \u2014 and it was 17-year-old Kevin Terris who spotted the first bone. \n \n \"At first, I was interested in seeing what the initial piece of bone sticking out of the rock was,\" Terris recalled in a news release. Then he called Farke over to investigate. Together, they picked away at the overlying rock to see what lay beneath. \"When we exposed the skull, I was ecstatic,\" Terris said. \n \n An artist's conception shows the baby dinosaur in its environment. \n \n That was back in 2009. Today, Terris is an aspiring paleontologist at Montana State University, and his discovery is the subject of a research paper published Tuesday by the journal PeerJ. In that paper, Farke and his colleagues report that the fossil is the \"youngest and most complete specimen\" representing Parasaurolophus, one of the strangest creatures in the dinosaur menagerie. \n \n Crazy crest \n \n Parasaurolophus was a plant-eating dinosaur that lived throughout western North America about 75 million years ago. Its most notable feature was a long hollow crest that stuck up from its head. Paleontologists believe the crest served not only as a kind of visual display, like the cockscomb on a rooster, but also as a resonator for deep, booming calls. (Check out this archived news release and audio file to sample the dinosaur's sound.) \n \n \n \n During the four years that followed the find, researchers carefully excavated Terris' discovery, had it airlifted to the lab, analyzed the fossilized bones and put the skeleton on display at the Alf Museum. It's been nicknamed \"Joe\" \u2014 in honor of the late Joseph Augustyn, a contributor to the museum. \n \n The skeleton of the baby Parasauropholus is on display at the Alf Museum. \n \n Little Joe would have been about 8 feet (2.5 meters) long in life, compared with a typical length of 33 feet (10 meters) for an adult Parasaurolophus. A sample taken from the fossil's leg bone indicated that Joe was less than a year old when it died. \n \n \n \n \"Dinosaurs have yearly growth rings in their bone tissue, like trees. But we didn't see even one ring,\" one of the PeerJ study's co-authors, Sarah Werning of Stony Brook University, explained. \"That means it grew to a quarter of adult size in less than a year.\" \n \n Woofers and tweeters \n \n Joe also had made a good start on its crest \u2014 which came as a surprise, because previous studies suggested that related types of dinosaurs didn't start sprouting their ornamentation until they were at least half of their adult size. The researchers suggest that Parasaurolophus youngsters had to start early in order to develop the ornate crest that the grownups had. \n \n \n \n \"If adult Parasaurolophus had 'woofers,' the babies had 'tweeters,'\" Farke said in the news release. \"The short and small crest of baby 'Joe' shows that it may have had a much higher pitch to its call than did adults. Along with the visual differences, this might have helped animals living in the same area figure out who was the big boss.\" \n \n Webb Schools student Brandon Scolieri looks in on the bones of the baby Parasaurolophus as they're being prepared for a CT scan. Scolieri is one of the authors of a newly published paper on the fossil. \n \n The research team had Joe's bones scanned to produce a virtual 3-D representation of the skeleton, which is being made available via the DinosaurJoe website. That way, scientists and the public will get access to Terris' find even if they can't see Joe in person at the Alf Museum in Claremont, Calif. \n \n Dinosaur skeletons are bought and sold for millions of dollars, but Farke declined to say how much Joe would be worth on the fossil market. It can't be sold, because it was found on federal property. \"We can't actually place a value on it,\" Farke told NBC News. \"Its primary value is scientific.\" \n \n Meanwhile, Terris isn't resting on his dino-finding laurels. The Houston native, who attended The Webb Schools because of its paleontology curriculum, told NBC News he's already working on his next publication. \n \n \"Paleo is something I've been interested in since I was a kid,\" he said. \n \n More about dinosaurs: \n \n In addition to Farke and Werning, the authors of \"Ontogeny in the Tube-Crested Dinosaur Parasaurolophus (Hadrosauridae) and Heterochrony in Hadrosaurids\" include high-school students Derek Chok, Annisa Herrero and Brandon Scolieri. The fossil was collected under a permit from Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument and the Bureau of Land Management. \n \n Alan Boyle is NBCNews.com's science editor.

The dinosaurs in this genus are best known for their impressive tube-shaped head crests, which may have been used for display or perhaps to amplify the animals' calls. The little specimen, dubbed \"Joe,\" was so young that its crest was a mere bump on its head. \n \n \"We now understand a lot more about how Parasaurolophus grew its crest,\" said Andrew Farke, a paleontologist and curator at Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology in Claremont, Calif. [See Photos of the Baby Dinosaur Discovery] \n \n Lucky find \n \n The museum is affiliated with The Webb Schools, a private high-school campus outside of Los Angeles. The students at the schools participate in paleontology fieldwork as part of their coursework, which is how student Kevin Terris came to discover \"Joe\" in 2009. \n \n Farke and a group of students were prospecting for fossils in Utah's Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, surveying ground Farke had already covered. Terris spotted a little sliver of bone sticking out from under a boulder and alerted Farke, who thought it looked like a piece of dinosaur rib \u2014 nice, but not really worth the trouble of excavating. \n \n \"We were going to try to see if we could get something better,\" Farke told LiveScience. \n \n He walked around the other side of the boulder and picked up what looked like a large cobblestone, turning it over in his hands. A dinosaur skull stared back at him. \n \n In light of the skull, Farke thought it wise to go re-check Terris' discovery. A closer look revealed it to be a string of toe bones. \n \n \"We have the skull on one side of this boulder and the toes on the other side. That means the whole dinosaur skeleton has to be in between,\" Farke said. \"So we got pretty excited.\" \n \n Growing baby \n \n The team had to line up permits to excavate on the public land; they returned in 2010 to dig the bones from the ground. Surrounded by an 800-pound (363 kilograms) armor of rock, the bones had to be airlifted out of the rugged backcountry by helicopter. [Video: Airlifting a Baby Dino] \n \n The skull of baby \"Joe\" sports a small bump that would have grown into an impressive tube-liked crest. Credit: Copyright Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology. \n \n After 1,300 painstaking hours of cleaning, chiseling and picking, technicians revealed the fossil buried in all that stone. The completeness of the skeleton turned out to be \"pretty spectacular,\" Farke said. \n \n The paleontologists realized they had an amazing example of a baby Parasaurolophus on their hands. Even better, they were able to sample the baby's leg bone. As dinosaur bones grow, they develop ring patterns, much like trees. \n \n \"It didn't have any rings at all,\" Farke said of \"Joe.\" \"So what that shows is that this animal was under a year old when it died.\" \n \n The infant dinosaur was already 6 feet (1.8 meters) long, however, an impressive feat when you consider that duck-billed dinos hatched at about the same size as a human infant. The fact that \"Joe\" was already sprouting a crest bump so young suggests that Parasaurolophus started growing its crest earlier than other duck-billed dinosaurs. \n \n \"It finally lets us understand how Parasaurolophus evolved that big crest, just by shifting around events in its development,\" Farke said. \n \n \"Joe\" will go on display at the Alf museum beginning today (Oct. 22) to coincide with a publication about the discovery in the journal PeerJ. A digital exploration of the skeleton will also be available at dinosaurjoe.com. \n \n As for Terris, the student who found the little duck-bill, he's now in college, studying geology, Farke said. \n \n Follow Stephanie Pappas on Twitter and Google+.

The victim, 30-year-old Perla Avina, was struck by one of the bullets fired at her husband's car Sunday. \n \n Oakland police have increased the reward for information leading to an arrest to $30,000. Avina's family told KTVU finding her killer is the only thing that will help their family heal. \n \n Through their inconsolable grief, Avina's parents begged for the public's help. \n \n \"If they know the person who did this, please turn him in. Turn him into the police, please, please, help us,\" said Herlinda Avina through sobs. She and husband Jose -- Perla's father -- hugged each other on the sofa of the family's living room. \n \n They know nothing will bring their beloved daughter back, but they are desperate for justice after Perla was killed in the road rage incident. \n \n Avina and her husband were driving back from the grocery store on Sunday afternoon when the incident occurred. \n \n Police won't explain exactly what happened on the road, but some sort of confrontation occurred as the couple was driving on 98th Avenue near Edes in Oakland at around noon. \n \n Someone in another car pulled up alongside the Avinas' black Toyota Camry and fired mulitple rounds into the car. Perla, in the passenger seat, was struck and killed by one of the bullets. \n \n \"This was such a senseless act,\" said Avina's manager Darlene Cederborg. \"This was a beautiful young woman with four young children and there was no reason for it\u2026 This never should have happened.\" \n \n Cederborg said Avina's work family was in mourning, too. \n \n Avina started working at a medical clinic in Emeryville eight years ago and worked her way up from front desk receptionist to surgery scheduler. \n \n \"A shining spirit.

    "document": "Three months ago, Harvard student Aran Khanna was preparing to start a coveted internship at Facebook when he launched a browser application from his dorm room that angered the social media behemoth. \n \n His application, called Marauder\u2019s Map \u2014 a clever name that Harry Potter fans will appreciate \u2014 was a Chrome extension that used data from Facebook Messenger to map where users were when they sent messages. The app also showed the locations, which were accurate to within three feet, in a group chat with people he barely knew. That meant complete strangers could hypothetically see that he had messaged them from a Starbucks around the corner, while he could see that they had messaged from their dorms. \n \n The app capitalized on a privacy flaw that Facebook had been aware of for about three years: the Facebook Messenger app automatically shared users\u2019 locations with anyone who they messaged. \n \n Advertisement - Continue Reading Below \n \n Khanna tweeted about the app on May 26 and posted about it on Reddit and Medium. Marauder\u2019s Map began to go viral. Facebook, never one to miss a trend, quickly caught on. \n \n Within three days, Facebook asked Khanna to disable the app. The company also deactivated location sharing from desktops, which meant Khanna\u2019s app wouldn\u2019t work even if he hadn\u2019t taken it down. And the company that Mark Zuckerberg famously launched from his Harvard dorm room withdrew its internship offer from this Harvard student, who apparently made the mistake of...launching an app from his dorm room. \n \n Before it was disabled, the extension was downloaded more than 85,000 times, Khanna said. \n \n About a week later, Facebook released a Messenger app update trumpeted as follows in a news release: \u201cWith this update, you have full control over when and how you share your location information.\u201d \n \n The description didn\u2019t mention the previous default settings. Nor did it point out that users who didn\u2019t activate the update would continue to share their locations by default unless they manually altered their privacy settings. \n \n Matt Steinfeld, a Facebook spokesman, said the company had been working on a Messenger update long before Khanna\u2019s blog post was published. \n \n \u201cThis isn\u2019t the sort of thing that can happen in a week,\u201d Steinfeld told Boston.com. \u201cEven though we move very fast here, they\u2019d been working on it for a few months.\u201d \n \n Khanna, who detailed the experience in a case study published Tuesday in Technology Science, a journal published by Harvard University, told Boston.com he created the app to show the consequences of unintentionally sharing data. That way, he said, users could decide for themselves whether or not it was a violation of their privacy. \n \n Facebook Messenger, the company\u2019s mobile messaging app, had been set up with automatic geolocation sharing since it launched in 2011. CNET drew attention to the issue in 2012 and showed users how to switch off location services. Various updates to the app improved its usability and even introduced fun cat emoji stickers, but the geolocation sharing remained. \n \n Khanna used Messenger frequently when he started studying at Harvard, but didn\u2019t realize how much information he was unintentionally sharing until he began to look at his message history. \n \n The day after Marauder\u2019s Map was posted, Khanna said his future manager at Facebook called him and asked him not to talk to the press. That evening, Khanna received a call from Facebook\u2019s global communications lead for privacy and public policy, who reiterated that Khanna shouldn\u2019t talk to the press because the story had become damaging. \n \n Khanna complied, redirecting all press inquiries back to Facebook. \n \n The next day, Facebook asked him to deactivate the extension. He did, but also updated his Medium post and the extension\u2019s description to make it clear that Facebook asked him to disable the map. \n \n Three days after the extension was posted, and two hours before he was supposed to leave to start his internship, Khanna received a call from a Facebook employee telling him that the company was rescinding his summer internship offer.

From 2011 to the start of this study in May 2015, Facebook Messenger collected and shared user geo-locations as the default setting for every message sent from the Android mobile app. These locations were visible to anyone in a group chat, regardless of his or her relationship to the sender on the Facebook social network. Noticing a lack of significant public response to the visible nature of geo-location data on Facebook Messenger, despite media coverage dating back to 2012, I hypothesized that users were either (1) not aware, or (2) not concerned about the collection and visibility of their geo-location data on the app. This study explored this hypothesis by testing how the public responded to easily seeing the historical geo-location data collected and shared by Facebook Messenger. This study also tested the response from Facebook, a company with a reputation for encouraging outside-the-box \"hacking\". I wrote a browser application that requires a Facebook user to log into their Facebook account and then displays on a map the geo-location data shared with that user through Facebook Messenger chats. I announced the tool in a blog post and publicized it on Twitter and a few other online forums. The immediate public response was that of surprise and concern over the privacy issue raised by the collection and visibility of the geo-location data. Results summary: My tool has been downloaded over 85,000 times since its release, and more than 170 global news publications linked to my post. During the first three days after release of the geo-location mapping tool, Facebook also responded by demanding that I take down the tool, which I did. Nine days after the release, Facebook made sharing geo-location data an opt-in feature, allowing users to select to share personal geolocations in Facebook Messenger, although all historical geo-location data is still archived and shared. The results of the study suggest sufficient public attention may be necessary for redress of reported privacy concerns. Introduction Hundreds of millions of people share personal information on Facebook. Starting in 2011, Facebook implemented initiatives focused on \"frictionless sharing\" to automatically post a user's activity on music apps, such as Spotify, or news readers, such as The Washington Post, that use Facebook's Open Graph to integrate their websites more closely with Facebook. [1] This automatic posting of songs listened to and articles read was not very popular with users, and Facebook announced in May 2014 that it would decrease the visibility of passively shared user activities on their friends' news feeds. [2, 3, 4] Regulators have also expressed privacy concerns with regard to how Facebook handles sharing of user data. For example, in Europe, the Belgian Privacy Commission found that Facebook \"fails to offer adequate control mechanisms\" for the use of user data. Furthermore, \"Facebook places too much burden on its users, [who are] expected to navigate Facebook's complex web of settings in search of possible opt-outs.\" Finally the commission stated that, \"Facebook's default settings related to behavioral profiling \u2026 are particularly problematic.\" [5, 6] Background In 2011 Facebook launched Facebook Messenger, an application (or \"app\") for Android and iOS mobile devices. Messenger has the ability to share geo-location with messages. [7] When a Facebook user sends a message from a smartphone using Messenger, the user's physical location can also be sent. Prior to a June 2015 update, unless a user changed the initial default settings of the program, the app would collect and display geo-location information with message content by default in all conversations on the Android app, including conversations in chat groups with people who are not direct friends on Facebook's social network. When the app first installs on a mobile device, a notice appears that informs the user that the app will collect and share geo-location information. After that notice appears, the only other indicator of location data collection and sharing is a small blue icon next to the textbox in a conversation. Figure 1 shows a screenshot of the Messenger app with this icon highlighted in Android. Figure 1. Image of Facebook Messenger's Android application showing a message sent by Roger. The small icon in the lower right, highlighted by a red box, is colored blue, showing that geo-location is being broadcast along with the message. Figure 2. The results of tapping a message with location attached on the Android app. Tapping on the message \"*margo sry android autocorrct\" reveals a map showing where the message originated. Figure 3. iOS app showing sender's location after the recipient clicks on a message with location attached. Other Facebook users can view shared geo-locations on the Facebook Messenger application by tapping on individual messages in their chat log, which reveals a map of the location where the individual was when the message was sent (Figure 2). On iOS, the application requests access to the device's geo-location data [9], and a similar interface for sharing location data in chats exists in the iOS Messenger app (Figure 3). On the desktop version of Messenger [10], geo-locations can be viewed by moving a mouse over a small pin attached to a message, to reveal a similar map (Figure 4). Figure 4. An image of a chat with Keyon from Facebook Messenger's desktop web application. The small pins next to the messages, highlighted by red boxes, show that geo-location is attached to these messages (and can be viewed by hovering the mouse over the pins). A user can disable geo-location sharing for individual conversations by pressing the blue icon in the app. A user can also disable geo-location sharing at any time for all messages by going into the application settings and finding the option to disable it. Adjusting privacy controls for location sharing on mobile operating systems is not entirely intuitive, as evidenced by the number of popular sites that have felt the need to publish guides on how to adjust geo-location controls. [11] Prior to the June 2015 Messenger update, location data sharing was on by default in Android. It required user permission to become perpetually active in the iOS Messenger app. [8] In 2012, CNET was the first major website to raise concerns about the privacy implications of Facebook Messenger's geo-location sharing feature. [12] A few other publications subsequently voiced concerns. [13, 14] Facebook did not take significant action to change the software in response to these concerns, and so the geo-location sharing continued to operate unchanged. There was not significant public pressure for change after the initial news coverage about Facebook's location sharing settings. This raises two questions: (1) whether Facebook users knew about the geo-location collection and sharing, and (2) whether they cared about its privacy implications. Facebook's location data practices presented an opportunity (1) to study how easy it is for a computer program to systematically copy the data and (2) to test whether Facebook's initial notification on app installation, along with the options to disable geo-location sharing within the Messenger app and through the Android and iOS system settings, were sufficient to satisfy the privacy concerns of users aware of the data sharing. My Interest in Facebook Messenger I became interested in this issue during the spring of 2015. At the time, I was a junior at Harvard College and had been offered a summer internship position at Facebook doing software development. I had secured the internship through Harvard's Office of Career Services' (OCS) On Campus Interview program. The internship was a paid position starting June 1, 2015, and I had signed a letter of intent to join the company, although I was not to be considered an employee until my June 1 start date, meaning that I was not privy to any proprietary information. I was attracted to work at Facebook by the popularity of its products and its publicly professed \"hacker culture\", where \"code wins arguments.\" [15] Methods My approach was to build an extension for a common web browser so that a person running the extension could see the geo-locations of any Facebook user who is sending them (or a chat group they are in) messages through Facebook Messenger. I would then make the extension publicly available and alert the public through a blog post, Twitter and online forums. This approach made public what some may already be doing \u2013 harvesting geo-location information about Facebook users they have been in conversations with. It also provided transparency and feedback to users about their geo-location settings on Facebook. If there was no reaction by users or Facebook, then Facebook's current geo-location data practices were potentially sufficient to address privacy concerns. My expectation was that the historical pattern of lack of public pressure on this issue evidenced from 2012 through May 2015 would continue. The Extension The extension is a lightweight program (called a \"script\") that runs on Google's popular web browser, Chrome. After a user logs into a Facebook account, when the Facebook Messenger page appears on Chrome on a desktop computer, the script runs in the background. It detects calls to update the message page, requests a copy of the content and then plots the location data associated with the content onto a map that appears in the browser. This approach allows the extension to access all the geo-location data delivered to the browser. The precision of the location coordinates was accurate enough to locate a user to within a meter. It is important to note that all the data retrieved were accessible without the extension if a user clicked on the map icon for each message. The script did nothing illegal or malicious; rather, it accessed and displayed data already available to the user. Furthermore, the data aggregated on the map remained temporarily in memory and was discarded when the page reloaded. A full technical overview of the system can be seen in Figure 5. Using the extension, a user can choose to see a map of the geo-location data collected and shared by Facebook Messenger about the user and about others users in the same chat group. Figure 7 shows a demonstration of a map created with the extension. I uploaded the Chrome extension to the Chrome Web Store, marking it as unlisted so that only those with a specific link, which I shared on my blog, could access it. [16] The title of the extension on the Chrome Web Store was \"Marauder's Map\", which can be seen in Figure 6. I also archived an open source copy of the code for the extension in an MIT-licensed Github repository with the title \"marauders-map\". [17] This repository contained the code and setup instructions for creating the extension from source. Figure 5. A graphical depiction giving a full technical overview of the marauders-map Chrome extension. White boxes represent the components injected by the extension. The extension consists of a Chrome background script that copies asynchronous requests from the desktop Facebook Messenger page to the Facebook cloud endpoint for retrieving messages, and then passes the HTTP bodies of these requests to an injected content script running on the Facebook Messenger page. This content script then emulates the original asynchronous request (automatically adding the appropriate headers) and plots the location data returned by Facebook onto a map drawn using the Mapbox API. With this base code, the extension can collect data on all messages loaded onto the page asynchronously. However, owing to optimizations in how Facebook delivers data to the browser, some messages are sent embedded in the initial HTML packet (via a protocol known as BigPipe). Using a simple asynchronous GET request, the content script pulls this HTML packet and uses a regular expression to parse the embedded location data from the messages, then plots the data on the map. Figure 6. A screenshot of the extension download page in the Google Play store. Clicking the \"Add to Chrome\" button allowed users to automatically install the extension. The total number of users (88,924) the extension had acquired over its lifetime is visible next to the star rating in the top left Figure 7. A labeled example of a map created by the extension The Blog Post I drafted a blog post that introduced me as an avid user of Facebook Messenger. The post highlighted the fact that the Facebook Messenger App transmits geo-locations alongside many of the messages sent from mobile devices. The post went on to describe how the Marauder's Map extension aggregates this data onto a map. It noted that, at least on Android devices, the default setting for Messenger sends geo-location with messages. The blog also provided some examples from using the extension, including how a person's geo-location can accumulate over time to reveal travel patterns and other information. Publicizing the Blog On May 26, 2015, I published the blog post and corresponding code on Medium.com. [18] I also posted URL links to the blog post and extension to both Reddit (reddit.com/r/privacy) [19], a popular forum for discussions on data privacy, and Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com) [20], a popular technical forum. Medium, Reddit, and Hacker News all have a voting system so that the most interesting articles are voted (or recommended) upwards to the top listings. Finally, using my public Twitter handle (@arankhanna), I sent out a tweet [21] asking my followers, consisting mainly of family and friends, to read the post. This study used, as one measure of public concern over Facebook Messenger's sharing of geo-location data, the popularity ranking of my posts on the three sites. If the public response to the posts was indifferent, then the ratings would likely not increase on these forums. This study also examined the quantity of news coverage received and the total number of downloads of the extension as other measures of public concern. Finally, the study examined Facebook's response to any public concern. Results Media Coverage News of the blog went viral, starting within 24 hours of posting and continuing for about 72 hours afterwards. For the first 12 hours of posting, little happened. The Reddit post received 7 upvotes, the Hacker News link also received 7 upvotes, and the Medium story had 3 recommendations by the end of the day. By the morning of the 27th, the story gained momentum on Twitter. Figures 8 and 9 show the Twitter responses to my posts over the week after I initially posted the blog. A total of 611 tweets and retweets reached a total follower audience of 3.63 million Twitter users. Figure 8. Twitter Activity after initial blog post. The total number of tweets about my posts per day between 5/26 and 5/31. Of the public tweets, 57% appeared on 5/27 as the story initially went viral globally and hit the front page of various forums such as Medium, Reddit Privacy, and Hacker News. The Twitter data for Figures 8, 9, and 12 was gathered by searching through all public Tweets between 5/26 and 6/5 (using Twitter's native search) for mentions of my name, my Twitter handle, Marauder's Map, and links to any of my postings and then recording all relevant tweets, their author, and their time of release. Figure 9. Twitter timeline. Total reach of tweets about my posts over the active hours between 5/26 and 5/29. The total number of tweets and retweets was 611 and the total number of Twitter followers reached was 3.63M. The measure of reach is the number of followers the tweets were delivered to. The figure shows the total number of tweets and the total number of followers reached. The biggest boost came from Medium.com, which tweeted about the post and promoted it on its site. The tweets from the largest influencers (those with over 10k followers) are labeled. The increased traffic to my posts raised their rankings. For example, my post on Medium became the most recommended story of the day. Posts linking to my blog and extension on both Hacker News and Reddit Privacy rose to the front page of both by 8 a.m. PST. By 9 a.m. PST, tech bloggers and content aggregators including The Next Web, Computerworld, and The Huffington Post covered the story in their blog posts and articles. The Huffington Post asked to directly cross-publish my Medium blog post on its site. Afterward, information about my posts spread to Al Jazeera, The International Business Times, and other major news organizations. Figure 10. Press coverage after initial blog post. The total number of press stories about my posts per day between 5/25 and 6/5. I gathered the news data for Figures 10, 11, and 12 by searching for mentions of my name, my Twitter handle, Marauder's Map and links to any of my postings between 5/26 and 6/5 on Google News and recording all relevant stories, their author, their time of release and their country of origin. By the 28th, only two days after my original posting, news stories about my posts appeared on CNN, The Guardian, The Washington Post, and many large international European, Australian, and Brazilian publications (e.g. La Stampa, Der Standard, Globo, NDTV, The Sydney Herald). By the 28th, large TV networks such as CNBC, ABC, CBS, and CNN had covered my posts as well. Figure 11 shows the total number of stories written about my posts per country. Figure 11. News coverage count by country. Count of news publications about my posts published on or before 6/5 grouped by country of origin. The United States, Europe and India were the top three origins for stories overall, with the United States accounting for over a third of all stories written. Figure 12. Twitter activity and news coverage by day. Number of tweets (right vertical axis) and press stories (left vertical axis) about my posts per day between 5/27 and 6/5. The total count of news publications was 178 and the total count of tweets was 347. The count of tweets and stories appearing on peak days are displayed. Extension Downloads There have been more than 85,000 downloads of the Chrome extension since its release (Figure 6). Users continued to download the extension even after I deactivated it in response to Facebook's request, as described below. Facebook's Response The afternoon of the 27th, one day after the Medium blog post's publication, Facebook contacted me. My future manager phoned and asked me not to speak to any press; however, I was told that I could keep my blog post up. By that evening, the global communications lead for privacy and public policy at Facebook called me to clarify Facebook's expectations that I not speak to the press, saying that his objective was to hamper the spread of what had become a damaging story. By midday of the 28th, the global communications lead for privacy and public policy at Facebook requested by email that I disable the extension. I complied within the hour by deactivating the Mapbox API key associated with the extension so that all current and future users could no longer load the map used to display geo-location data. On the morning of the 29th, three days after my initial posts, media reported that my Chrome extension was turned off and no longer viable. Additionally, Facebook had tweaked its code to remove location data from browsers. This alteration did not change Facebook's policy of collecting and sharing geo-location data by default from the Facebook Messenger app on Android and with user permission on iOS. However, Facebook no longer transmitted this location data to browsers. This action merely halted the use of an extension such as mine that uses browser data. Geo-locations remained visible on the Facebook Messenger mobile application, and seemingly, the map could be rebuilt using an interface to the mobile application. On the afternoon of the 29th, three days after my initial posts, Facebook phoned me to inform me that it was rescinding the offer of a summer internship, citing as a reason that the extension violated the Facebook user agreement by \"scraping\" the site. The head of global human resources and recruiting followed up with an email message stating that my blog post did not reflect the \"high ethical standards\" around user privacy expected of interns. According to the email, the privacy issue was not with Facebook Messenger, but rather with my blog post and code describing how Facebook collected and shared users' geo-location data. On June 4, nine days after my original posts, Facebook officially announced a Messenger update with a new feature requiring users to opt into sharing their location during chats. Sharing would no longer be the default. The press release did not mention the previous default settings for geo-location data and did not disclose with whom Facebook would share the previously collected data. [22] As of June 2015, shared geo-location data from before the update remains viewable on the mobile application, and users who did not update to the new versions of the Messenger app on iOS and Android still share geo-locations in the same manner as before. Discussion At the beginning of the study, historical behavior by Facebook and its users suggested that there might not be significant public concern about Facebook Messenger's sharing of geo-location data. Even though the media had highlighted the issue four years earlier, Facebook had not been concerned enough to make any fundamental change to its software. So, why the big change now? What seems to have made the difference was transparency. It is possible that before my extension and blog post, the degree of location data collection and sharing by Facebook Messenger was hard for an average user to notice and thus did not raise significant concern. Without public pressure, Facebook may have lacked significant incentive to change. My extension and blog post made the data collection and sharing practice real and transparent. The resulting public attention, with over 85,000 downloads of my tool, more than 170 news articles, and 3.6 million Twitter users exposed to my posts through tweets and retweets, seemed to motivate Facebook to react. What does this say about privacy protection? Can we reasonably expect Facebook or others with an interest in collecting and sharing personal data, to be responsible guardians of privacy? Could this work have been done inside Facebook to understand how its users view the collection and sharing of their data? Must future privacy guardians always be on the outside? References 1.

Feel free to provide ideas for next steps, follow-on research, or other research inspired by this paper. Perhaps someone will read your comment, do the described work, and publish a paper about it. What do you recommend as a next research step? Suggestion 1 How does Facebook's Privacy Policy or Facebook's License Agreement for the app at the time match these changes in Facebook Messenger's default on sharing personal geolocation? How do these compare with other apps that share personal geolocation data with other users? [Editors] Suggestion 2 The demonstration code in this paper used the browser. Is the same information still available if you wrote code that could access the information that would be delivered to a mobile phone? [Editors] Suggestion 3 Which news outlets were critical in spreading the word? Have these information flows been instrumental in possibly influencing other technology changes? [Editors] Suggestion 4 I would like to see some ethnographic studies that elucidate the depth of understanding of this issue by the \"common man.\" How is privacy understood by older or less tech savvy individuals? How likely are these people to be aware of these issues? What protections should exist for those who are not knowledgeable enough to protect themselves? Suggestion 5 Interview with Apple's Tim Cook and get on his privacy/secyurity team! (And thanks for the important difference you've already made.) Continued Good Luck on your career! Suggestion 6 First of all, thank you for your great work. I would like to see more studies about privacy awareness in people. What will make people act? What makes companies act? Suggestion 7 Excellent analysis of the information dissemination through various channels Aran! I would like to see more studies that track information dissemination. What are good ways to collect that data? Suggestion 8 Maybe this was a feature in messenger, not a flaw. Maybe opt-out rather than opt-in made for a better user experience. I would like to see a study about utility. Did users like it better the other way? Or, are users indifferent to the change? Is anyone complaining about the change? Your paper suggests that the media coverage made a difference. Is the media response a good proxy for how users feel? Suggestion 9 Remember the Golden Rule: He with the Gold makes the rules. Being correct and right in the context of an angry employer... ramifications. I would like to know whether an employee can ever really do this kind of work effectively? Suggestion 10 I would like to see a study of whistle blower laws. Maybe they need to be beefed up. Suggestion 11 This is a brilliant study and exposes the lack of privacy concerns by companies like Facebook, which pay little more than lip service to an issue that most Internet users care about deeply. I'm sure Facebook felt its collective \"face\" flush over the embarrassment of this, got indignant and revoked the student's internship. Instead, the company should have hired him on the spot. A company that exalts itself as encouraging hacking culture, as Facebook does, would have been a good candidate to have hired him, but they did not. I would like to see a study about corporate structures and cultures to better understand the internal pressures that lead to this outcome, which seems typical. Suggestion 12 Question: Did the author Mr.Khanna consult his supervisor before publishing the tool? Did he even know who his Facebook supervisor might be? He did this work while he was still at school and before the summer internship started. Mr. Khanna said he promptly complied with Facebook instructions to stop the demo. I would like a study about the role and responsibilities of summer interns who do research at school and who are employees for a summer. How does this work? Can only students who will never do research related to a company be hired by the company? Should students who want to be hired never do this kind of research? It seems optimal to have students interested in doing this kind of work actually being hired by these companies. Is that possible? Suggestion 13 It's not just FACEBOOK that's doing this. I would like to see a study of geolocation sharing across apps. Suggestion 14 Excellent work. I would like to vote up Suggestion 4. I am quite common, with zero tech savvy. Yet even I can recognize the implications of hacking and tracking personal devices without the user's knowledge and my concern is dismissed by most as paranoia. I would love to know what the tipping point might be for people. We love our wired world and we have willingly put on blinders, when are we forced to look and know? Suggestion 15 I write this not to thank Mr. Khanna. If the number of people who tweeted is in millions then the number of passive people would probably be at least 10 times. I was surprised by the fact that geolocation pin points to within a meter. That's scary. I would like a study that tracks how much of a person's time is captured in someone's geo-location database. If I carry my mobile phone with me all the time, then how often does some database somewhere know where I am? Suggestion 16 Very interesting. It would be interesting too to know how many times similar historical private information's (like users position, calls, messages, etc.) have been accessed after creation dates, from what location, read only or modified, moved to another category/location, etc. The metadata of archived files for alpha individuals and for beta groups (e.g., by interests, age, location, incomes) can provide many details. An analyze from this reversed point of view, of how the databases in question are used further by their owners, could reveal their objects of interest (not really connected with targeted advertising), as well as lots of details about the interested persons behind. Suggestion 17 It would be interesting to learn how much is known by vulnerable populations about about default location sharing of Facebook and other apps. Victims of domestic violence, jurors, and police are examples of populations that may be vulnerable in different ways. Suggestion 18 If only facebook itself views my geo location, it wouldn't be an issue for me. But if others can see it, then it is. I would like to see a survey of personal attitudes towards geolocation sharing. Suggestion 19 When Facebook started selling mobile ads in 2012, not even the keenest optimists could have predicted how big a success they would become. In each of the past ten quarters, mobile ads have accounted for more then 90% of Facebook's revenue growth. In the first six months of 2015, all of the company's growth came from advertising on tablets and smartphones. Mobile ad revenue now accounts for 76 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue and 72 percent of total revenue. I would be interested to know the role of geo-tagging in FB`s revenues as stated above. If all users disabled their geo-tagging, what will be the impact on FB to sell customized ads. Suggestion 20 I cannot find out \"Is geo-location so important to be used by applications\". I mean it should be an option like \"What's App\" gives share your location , only with those we want to share and not by default with all. Pin-point accurate geo-location is not necessary rather only the region from which the user is online is sufficient to share. I appreciate the way Mr. Aran did the whole analysis and presentation systematically. Big companies should take care of their users who blindly believe and uses their applications and should seek prior permission before collection and share of user's data about location. I would like to see a study to know if more gross geo-location reporting would work as well in many apps that use geo-location. Suggestion 21 I see that you do not cite names from Facebook, which understandably is in keeping with most academic guidelines and with most human subject considerations. Everything should be documented and if applicable in writing such as your internship. The fact your paper does not give names of specific people does not hold them accountable for thier actions, and makes investigations much harder. I would have had a signed legal internship document before I moved. I would like to see, among other things, an ethongraphic study that interviews employees and includes those involved. For that, I assume if researchers contact you that you will share the names of the people. Suggestion 22 Found your site on Google. This is a cool post. I'd like to see you take the main idea from this article and carete another second experiment, and maybe you could embed a vid, also? Suggestion 23 Read this article because of my school assignment. Do we still have privacy? Thank you for educating people and making me aware of everything that is happening now. Suggestion 24 Apparently, when you download a copy of your Facebook data, it also downloads a .txt file called \"security\". If opened with MS Word, it shows ALL account activity, used cookies, user agents, IP addresses, estimated geolocations and administrative records such as name changes and checkpoint accesses. At this point, we all know that Facebook collects data on its users. But perhaps you could demonstrate how vast that data is.

Furthermore, Facebook has deactivated location sharing from the desktop webpage so the extension will not work. \n \n When I came to college Facebook Messenger became an integral part of my digital life. I quickly found that it was the easiest way to keep in touch with old high school friends, contact people I had just met, organize impromptu poker games with people I hardly knew, and everything in between. However, I didn't realize how much data about me Messenger was revealing to the people I chatted with until last week when I began tinkering with my message history. \n \n As you may know, when you send a message from the Messenger app there is an option to send your location with it. What I realized was that almost every other message in my chats had a location attached to it, so I decided to have some fun with this data. I wrote a Chrome extension for the Facebook Messenger page (https://www.facebook.com/messages/) that scrapes all this location data and plots it on a map. You can get this extension here and play around with it on your message data. \n \n A screenshot of the map the extension creates: \n \n What I Found \n \n You may not believe that there are enough of these location tagged messages to provide truly invasive data on any one person, since they must be on mobile, with GPS on, and choose to share their location for it to be sent\u2026 right? \n \n What you should keep in mind is that the mobile app for Facebook Messenger defaults to sending a location with all messages. \n \n You can see this location data by clicking on individual messages in the mobile app to reveal a map of where they were sent from. \n \n You can tell if your location is being shared in a message if the little GPS icon next to the text-box is colored blue. \n \n Go ahead and see how many messages in your chats have locations attached. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s a lot of them. And if this isn't already starting to get a bit weird, the first thing I noticed when I started to write my code was that the latitude and longitude coordinates of the message locations have more than 5 decimal places of precision, making it possible to pinpoint the sender\u2019s location to less than a meter. \n \n Coordinates scraped by my code for two of my friends. \n \n Once the extension was written I naturally started seeing what kind of things I could discover about my Facebook friends. \n \n I am in a pretty active group chat with some of my brother\u2019s friends (who I am friends with on Facebook but don\u2019t know too well). They are all fairly active on the chat, posting once a day or more. \n \n Let\u2019s pick on the one who goes to Stanford. By simply looking at the cluster of messages sent late at night you can tell exactly where his dorm is, and in fact approximately where his room is located in that dorm. \n \n Where my acquaintance who goes to Stanford sleeps. \n \n Furthermore, by gathering a couple weeks\u2019 worth of chat data on the map and looking at the location clusters you can even figure out his weekly schedule. With this you can predict exactly which building he would be in at a given time. \n \n The location history data over the course of a few weeks for my Stanford acquaintance. \n \n In fact I found that I could infer a schedule for almost everyone in this chat as well as the other active chats I am in. \n \n Highlighted the important location clusters for another Facebook friend who is a student at UW \n \n I found that I could even do this for people who I am not Facebook friends with. I am currently in a large active chat to organize poker games with some fellow students, many of whom I am not Facebook friends with. However, I can still track their locations extremely accurately from the messages they send the group. \n \n The detailed location history of someone I am not friends with on Facebook \n \n You can now see the fun (and slightly creepy) things this data allows you to do. But wait there's more! One day when I was chatting frequently with a friend of mine (@tomasreimers) the map allowed me to track his hour by hour locations. At the end of that day the location history on the map closely matched the location history collected by his phone. \n \n Additionally, this map aggregates the location data from all the messages that I send. For the days I was frequently on messenger (posting to different conversations every hour or so), my location history on this map lined up very closely with my phone\u2019s location history. \n \n My scraped messenger location history for a certain active day \n \n My Android phone\u2019s location history for that same day. \n \n This means that if a few people who I am chatting with separately collude and send each other the locations I share with them, they would be able to track me very accurately without me ever knowing. \n \n If you want to map your friends\u2019 locations to see for yourself how fun (and creepy) this data is you can download the extension for Chrome here. The code is also available and open source on Github. \n \n For those of you already wanting out here is a great guide on how to ensure you don\u2019t send your locations from the Messenger app. \n \n What\u2019s The Problem? \n \n Let me reiterate that I still find Facebook Messenger extremely useful and use it religiously, albeit with location sharing now turned off. This may lead you to wonder if there really is a problem here, since there is always option to not share your exact coordinates with messages. However, everyone I have shown this extension to has been anywhere from surprised to appalled that this much of their very personal data is online for their friends (and even complete strangers) to access. So it is seems that there is an issue. \n \n Let\u2019s start at the root of the problem: why do so many people give up their location data so readily on Messenger? \n \n The main problem is that every time you open your phone and send a single message it\u2019s so easy to forget about your location data being attached to it. Furthermore, it seems so harmless to attach a location with a single message, but the problem is over time the information from these messages adds up. \n \n Both of these issues in some way stem from the fact that locations are not only included by default, but also are rather subtly placed in the UI. The power of defaults on human behavior is well documented in psychology and suggests that few people will put in the effort to deviate from the default action of sharing. Furthermore, because there are no readily visible consequences to sharing your location, users are never incentivized to devote attention to what this default of sharing is actually revealing about them. \n \n I decided to write this extension, because we are constantly being told how we are losing privacy with the increasing digitization of our lives, however the consequences never seem tangible. With this code you can see for yourself the potentially invasive usage of the information you share, and decide for yourself if this is something you should worry about. \n \n If you found this interesting you may also enjoy my post on Venmo\u2019s privacy flaws and the extension I made to reveal them.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Talk about being too good at your non-job. A Harvard University junior lost his Facebook internship two hours before he had planned to travel to it after he exploited a privacy issue in the social network's Messenger system. Aran Khanna discussed his experience and findings in a paper published in Harvard's Technology Science journal. \"From 2011 to the start of this study in May 2015, Facebook Messenger collected and shared user geo-locations as the default setting for every message sent from the Android mobile app,\" he writes. The flaw was that those locations could be seen by anyone in a group chat, even if the person who sent the message wasn't friends with everyone else in the group. And so Khanna developed a browser app called Marauder's Map that exposed, on a map, the geo-location data that was being shared. He tweeted about his Chrome extension and posted about it on Medium on May 26. By the 28th, CNN, the Washington Post, and many others had covered his findings; the extension was downloaded 85,000 times. That same day, Facebook asked Khanna to disable the app; he did. The company also deactivated location sharing on desktops and released a June 4 update that required users to opt in to location sharing. It also withdrew Khanna's internship, which was to start on June 1. The official reason given was a violation of the \"high ethical standards expected of interns,\" according to Boston.com. \"This mapping tool scraped Facebook data in a way that violated our terms,\" a Facebook rep tells the site. Khanna says his app was created using his own Messenger history, not data scraping. \"I didn't write the program to be malicious,\" he says. Khanna ended up securing an internship with another Silicon Valley firm. (This alleged intern tale of woe involves the Olsen twins.)",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 When Harvard student Aran Khanna launched Marauder\u2019s Map, a browser extension that used data from Facebook Messenger to map where users were when they sent messages, he angered the social media behemoth. The app also showed the locations, which were accurate to within three feet, in a group chat with people he barely knew. That meant complete strangers could hypothetically see that he had messaged them from a Starbucks around the corner, while he could see that they hadmessaged from their dorms. Facebook, never one to miss a trend, quickly caught on. Within three days, Facebook asked Khanna to disable the app. The company also deactivated location sharing from desktops, which meant Khanna's app wouldn't work even if he hadn't taken it down. Khanna tweeted about the app on May 26 and posted about it on Reddit and Medium. Marauder's Map\u2014a clever name that Harry Potter fans will appreciate\u2014began to go viral.

People who adopted \u201cexpansive postures\u201d\u2014widespread limbs and a stretched-out torso\u2014in speed-dating situations garnered more romantic interest than those who folded their arms in \u201cclosed postures,\u201d the researchers found. \n \n For her recent paper, published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Tanya Vacharkulksemsuk, a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of California, Berkeley, performed two studies. First, she and her team watched videos of 144 speed-dates and correlated them with the participants\u2019 ratings of each other. People who sat in expanded postures were deemed more attractive, and for both men and women, postural expansiveness nearly doubled their chances of getting a \u201cyes\u201d response to a second date. Even laughing and smiling didn\u2019t work as well as spreading out, Vacharkulksemsuk found. \n \n Next, Vacharkulksemsuk posted pictures of people in open and closed postures on a dating site. Again, those in the expansive postures were about 25 percent more likely to generate interest from another user. However, this strategy worked much better for men than women. Men, overall, received far fewer bites than women did, but 87 percent of their \u201cyeses\u201d came in response to an open posture. For women, meanwhile, 53 percent of \u201cyes\u201d responses came when they were in an expansive posture. \n \n In a separate test, Vacharkulksemsuk found that both the male and female \u201cexpansive\u201d photos were considered more dominant than the \u201cclosed\u201d photos. That dominance might suggest an abundance of resources and a willing to share those resources.

New research suggests that humans trying online dating apps and speed-dating might want to follow their lead. \n \n Previous studies have shown that nonverbal cues such as a smile or a nod of the head garner interest from potential romantic partners. The gestures have what scientists call \"positive signal value,\" meaning they create the impression that you are warm and friendly, someone others want to be around. \n \n But modern courtship rarely lasts long enough to form an impression based on meaningful, real-life interactions. Decisions are made in a matter of minutes, even seconds, with a single swipe in digital dating or a passing encounter in the real world. \n \n Research based on two studies found that literally extending yourself could make you more attractive in speed and online dating. In a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that body postures involving widespread limbs and a stretched torso nearly doubles the odds of success compared with closed postures involving limbs held close to the torso, hunched over. \n \n It's called \"postural expansiveness,\" and it basically refers to how much space you take up with your torso and limbs. Such \"power postures\" convey dominance and willingness to share those traits with others, study co-author Tanya Vacharkulksemsuk said. \n \n Read More ||||| This set of studies tested whether humans are more attracted to individuals displaying their bodies expansively, a behavior considered to express both dominance and openness. Results from two field studies\u2014a speed-dating event and a controlled experiment using a Global Positioning System-based dating application\u2014suggested that (i) expansive (vs. contractive) body posture increases one\u2019s romantic desirability; (ii) these results are consistent across gender; and (iii) perceived dominance and perceived openness are mechanisms through which expansiveness exerts its effect. These findings indicate that in modern-day dating contexts, in which initial attraction often is determined by a rapid decision following a brief interaction or seeing a photograph, displays of expansive posture increase one\u2019s chances of initial romantic success. \n \n Abstract \n \n Across two field studies of romantic attraction, we demonstrate that postural expansiveness makes humans more romantically appealing. In a field study (n = 144 speed-dates), we coded nonverbal behaviors associated with liking, love, and dominance. Postural expansiveness\u2014expanding the body in physical space\u2014was most predictive of attraction, with each one-unit increase in coded behavior from the video recordings nearly doubling a person\u2019s odds of getting a \u201cyes\u201d response from one\u2019s speed-dating partner. In a subsequent field experiment (n = 3,000), we tested the causality of postural expansion (vs. contraction) on attraction using a popular Global Positioning System-based online-dating application. Mate-seekers rapidly flipped through photographs of potential sexual/date partners, selecting those they desired to meet for a date. Mate-seekers were significantly more likely to select partners displaying an expansive (vs. contractive) nonverbal posture. Mediation analyses demonstrate one plausible mechanism through which expansiveness is appealing: Expansiveness makes the dating candidate appear more dominant. In a dating world in which success sometimes is determined by a split-second decision rendered after a brief interaction or exposure to a static photograph, single persons have very little time to make a good impression. Our research suggests that a nonverbal dominance display increases a person\u2019s chances of being selected as a potential mate.",

    "document": "Expand Afghan Local Police, Gizab village of Uruzgan province, Afghanistan, April 2011. \u00a9 2011 AP Photo \n \n (Kabul) \u2013 Militias and some units of the new US-backed Afghan Local Police are committing serious human rights abuses, but the government is not providing proper oversight or holding them accountable, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. The Afghan government and the US should sever ties with irregular armed groups and take immediate steps to create properly trained and vetted security forces that are held accountable for their actions. \n \n The 102-page report, \u201c\u2018Just Don\u2019t Call It a Militia:\u2019 Impunity, Militias and the \u2018Afghan Local Police,\u2019\u201d documents serious abuses, such as killings, rape, arbitrary detention, abductions, forcible land grabs, and illegal raids by irregular armed groups in northern Kunduz province and the Afghan Local Police (ALP) force in Baghlan, Herat, and Uruzgan provinces. The Afghan government has failed to hold these forces to account, fostering future abuses and generating support for the Taliban and other opposition forces, Human Rights Watch found. \n \n \u201cThe Afghan government has responded to the insurgency by reactivating militias that threaten the lives of ordinary Afghans\u201d said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \u201cKabul and Washington need to make a clean break from supporting abusive and destabilizing militias to have any hope of a viable, long-term security strategy.\u201d \n \n As part of its exit strategy, the US military is training and mentoring the year-old village-level ALP force.In March 2011, the commander of the international forces in Afghanistan at the time, Gen. David Petraeus, told the US Senate that the ALP is \u201carguably the most critical element in our effort to help Afghanistan develop the capability to secure itself.\u201d \n \n Cases investigated by Human Rights Watch raise serious concerns about Afghan government and international efforts to arm, fund, vet, and hold accountable irregular armed groups. In Kunduz province, militias have spread quickly in recent years. Their increase is a deliberate policy of the National Directorate of Security (NDS), Afghanistan\u2019s intelligence agency, which has reactivated militia networks primarily through the Shura-e-Nazar (\u201cSupervisory Council\u201d of the north) and Jamiat-i-Islami networks, and provided money and weapons without sufficient oversight. \n \n \u201cJust Don\u2019t Call It a Militia\u201d is based on over 120 interviews with victims of abuses and family members, village elders, witnesses, nongovernmental organization workers, Afghan security, human rights and government officials, foreign military officials and diplomats, journalists, and Afghanistan analysts. \n \n In most cases of serious abuses documented by Human Rights Watch in Kunduz, no action had been taken against those responsible. For example, in Khanabad district in August 2009, a militia killed four men due to a family dispute. An NDS official confirmed that the police could not arrest anyone involved in the killing because of the militia commander\u2019s connection to the provincial chief of police and a local strongman who is closely involved with abusive armed groups. A prosecutor who is also the father of one of the men killed told Human Rights Watch, \u201cNo one has helped me, and I work for the government, so what about the other people? Who will listen to them?\u201d \n \n \u201cPatronage links to senior officials in the local security forces and the central government allow supposedly pro-government militias to terrorize local communities and operate with impunity,\u201d Adams said. \n \n At the same time, the rapid build-up of the ALP has contributed to concerns about whether it will be a law-abiding force, Human Rights Watch said. Created in July 2010 at the behest of the US, the force is supposed to supplement the Afghan national army and police at the community and village levels. The Afghan Local Police is seen by the US military as a way to address the pressures of trying to hand over control of security to the Afghan government by 2014. \n \n Village shuras (councils) are tasked to nominate and vet members of the ALP, whose units report to the district chief of police. Units trained for only 21 days are being armed and deployed in areas where there is limited Afghan national army and police presence. As of August, 7,000 men had been recruited to the force. Plans are under way to arm and train up to 30,000. \n \n Afghan and US officials told Human Rights Watch that the ALP has improved security in some areas. In some communities, local residents interviewed by Human Rights Watch welcomed the new force and cited improvements in security. But other residents said the new police had not been properly vetted, citing criminal and insurgent elements being absorbed into the force. Many complained that the ALP, like other irregular armed groups, is not held accountable when implicated in abuses. \n \n Although the force is fairly new, Human Rights Watch documented several serious abuses by its members. In February in Shindand district in Herat province, for example, an ALP unit raided several houses, stealing belongings, beating residents, and illegally detaining six men. In another case, the ALP have been accused of beating teenage boys and hammering nails into the feet of one boy, but have not been arrested. \n \n In Baghlan province, former fighters with the Islamist Hezb-i-Islami, including a local strongman, Nur-ul Haq, have been recruited into the ALP. Haq and his men have been implicated in killings, land-grabs, and abductions. But the police have refused to investigate the allegations, telling Human Rights Watch that they are unable to question suspected ALP members due to their connections with powerful government officials and US special forces. In April, four armed ALP members in Baghlan abducted a 13-year-old boy on his way home from the bazaar and took him to the house of an ALP sub-commander, where he was gang raped. He escaped the next day. Although the assailants\u2019 identities were well known, no arrests have taken place. \n \n In Uruzgan province in December 2010, a local strongman, Neda Muhammed, detained six elders after they refused to agree to provide men to the ALP. Some ALP members in Khas Uruzgan have been implicated by local officials and residents in illegal raids, beatings, and forcible collection of ushr (informal tax). \n \n Afghan and international proponents of the ALP point to safeguards, such as the Afghan Interior Ministry control over the ALP, village shura vetting of members, and training and mentoring by US special operations forces. But the national police lack adequate command and control structures, and the ALP often far outnumber the national police in the districts where they operate, Human Rights Watch said. Interior Ministry officials have also conceded to Human Rights Watch that such safeguards had also been promised for many of the previous community defense initiatives that ended in failure. \n \n Previous programs to create local defense forces have been hijacked by local strongmen or by ethnic or political factions, spreading fear, fuelling vendettas, and in some areas even playing into the hands of Taliban insurgents, Human Rights Watch said. One example was the Afghan National Auxiliary Police (ANAP), created in 2006, which was barely trained, underwent minimal vetting, had poorly defined rules of engagement, had high levels of infiltration, and was highly corrupt. Another, the Afghan Public Protection Force (AP3) in Wardak province, was hijacked by local strongmen and became involved in beatings and intimidation. \n \n \u201cWhile there is a need for more security at the village level, the Afghan and US governments should be very careful not to repeat the mistakes of militias past,\u201d Adams said. \u201cIf quick corrections are not made, the ALP could end up being just another militia that causes more problems than it cures.\u201d \n \n Human Rights Watch called on the US and Afghan governments to avoid the rush to set up new units of the ALP around the country without proper vetting, oversight, and accountability mechanisms, as has occurred with some units. \n \n Human Rights Watch also urged the Afghan government to investigate all allegations of abuse by militias and the ALP, to allocate adequate resources to investigate complaints, and to create an external complaints body to act on reports of abuses by the ALP and other police forces. \n \n \u201cPressure to reduce international troop levels should not be at the expense of the rights of Afghans,\u201d Adams said. \u201cThe Afghan government and its supporters need to understand that insecurity does not come only from the insurgency. Poor governance, corruption, human rights abuses, and impunity for government-affiliated forces all are drivers of the insurgency, and these issues need to be addressed if true stability is to come to Afghanistan.\u201d ||||| Updated 2 p.m. \n \n Ten years of war. Two years of an accelerated effort to train Afghans to take over that fight, at an annual cost of $6 billion. And not a single Afghan army battalion can operate without assistance from U.S. or allied units. \n \n That was the assessment made by the officer responsible for training those Afghan soldiers, Lt. Gen. William Caldwell. Out of approximately 180 Afghan National Army battalions, only two operate \u201cindependently.\u201d Except that \u201cindependently,\u201d in Caldwell\u2019s National Training Mission-Afghanistan command, means something different than \u201cindependently\u201d does in the States. \n \n Those two \u201cindependent\u201d battalions still require U.S. support for their maintenance, logistics and medical systems,\u201d Caldwell admitted when Pentagon reporters pressed him on Monday morning. \n \n \u201cToday, we haven\u2019t developed their systems to enable them to do that yet,\u201d Caldwell said. \n \n Building up foreign armies isn\u2019t easy. During 2008\u2032s battle for Basra, Iraqi forces relied heavily on U.S. and British support \u2014 and still saw more than a thousand desertions. That was four years after then Maj. Gen. David Petraeus took over the training of the Iraqi military. \n \n For the past two years, Caldwell\u2019s overseen a big push to expand, professionalize and train Afghan soldiers and cops. Caldwell has gotten bodies into uniforms: the Afghan army and police total 305,516 today, up from 196,508 last December, and they\u2019re \u201con track,\u201d Caldwell says, to reach 352,000 by November 2012. \n \n Caldwell praised Afghan police officers during the Taliban\u2019s audacious attack on Kabul earlier this month. Two separate cops \u201cliterally did a bear hug\u201d on separate suicide bombers in different places around the city, sacrificing themselves in the process. \u201cPolicemen were doing heroic deeds,\u201d Caldwell said. \n \n But most of Afghanistan\u2019s men in uniform can\u2019t read at a kindergarten level, much less understand the instrument panels on a helicopter or the serial numbers on their rifles. \n \n That\u2019s one reason why it\u2019ll be years before the U.S. takes its training wheels off the Afghan soldiers\u2019 bikes. Although the Obama administration plans to turn the war over to forces Caldwell trains by 2014, Caldwell told Danger Room in June that the Afghans will need U.S. training until as late as 2017. \n \n That is, if attrition doesn\u2019t get in the way. Caldwell expressed alarm that 1.4 percent of Afghan cops and 2.3 percent of Afghan soldiers walk off the job every month, saying that if \u201cleft unchecked [attrition] could undo much of the progress made to date.\u201d Yet last week, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta testified that attrition rates are \u201cas much as three percent per month. \n \n Asked by Danger Room about the increase, Caldwell simply said that the \u201cgoal we\u2019ve set\u201d is a 1.4 monthly attrition level across both forces. In the Afghan National Army, attrition \u201chas been steady over the last year. We have not seen the decline,\u201d Caldwell said. \n \n Then there\u2019s the nagging issue of human rights. \u201cU.S. officials have for years been aware of credible allegations that newly-installed Kandahar police chief [Brigadier General Abdul] Raziq and his men participated in a cold-blooded massacre of civilians,\u201d writes Matthieu Aikins, in a gut-wrenching new expose for The Atlantic. Yet Raziq has been showered with cash and official praises from the highest level of the American-led coalition in Afghanistan. \n \n Caldwell has instituted an additional 18 hours of training on respecting Afghans\u2019 rights into the eight-week course that the typical would-be Afghan cop takes. But Caldwell doesn\u2019t train every Afghan cop. Members of a program called the Afghan Local Police \u2014 founded in 2010 by Petraeus to recruit auxiliaries against the Taliban \u2014 has been implicated in \u201ckillings, rape, arbitrary detention, abductions, forcible land grabs, and illegal raids by irregular armed groups,\u201d according to a Human Rights Watch report issued this month. \n \n Special Operations Forces are responsible for turning these groups into respectable units. When Danger Room asked if it was time for Caldwell to take over that training, Caldwell said, \u201cWe\u2019ve not been asked to at this point\u2026 If there is a request for us to help and become engaged in that, we obviously would. But at this point, I think the special forces element that has the responsibility for that clearly sees and understands what that report says. We all take that very seriously.\u201d \n \n With insurgents assassinating the man in charge of negotiating a peace deal, the Afghan security forces are the backbone of the U.S.\u2019 long-term plan for Afghan security. During his Senate testimony on Thursday, Panetta called their development \u201cone of the most notable successes\u201d of the war. \n \n Yet not only can no Afghan army battalion operate without U.S. aid, the U.S. has been purchasing them a lot of creature comforts. Caldwell said that his command recently stopped buying air conditioning units for Afghan barracks, replacing them with fans instead \u2014 part of an effort to pare down the $6 billion that it costs to keep the Afghan security forces going. Caldwell said he expects that number to drop \u2014 in part because someday Afghanistan won\u2019t be ravaged by insurgency (maybe, hopefully) \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t know how much it\u2019ll drop by, or by when. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m still very realistic about the challenges out there,\u201d Caldwell said. \n \n Update: I misheard Caldwell during today\u2019s Pentagon briefing when he discussed the goal he\u2019s set for monthly attrition rates. Thanks to his public-affairs officer, Lt. Col. Shawn Stroud, for alerting me to my mistake. \n \n Photo: Flickr/DVIDSHUB ||||| Abdul Raziq and his men have received millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. training and equipment to help in the fight against the Taliban. But is our ally\u2014long alleged to be involved in corruption and drug smuggling\u2014also guilty of mass murder? \n \n Above: Afghan General Abdul Raziq, seen here with American forces during a joint 2009 patrol near the Pakistan border (Emilio Morenatti/AP) \n \n Shyly, at times smiling with weak adolescent bravado, the two young men recounted to me how they were beaten and tortured. It was July, and we were sitting at a table in the cavernous restaurant where they both work, in the stupefying summer heat. They slouched forward with their arms on their knees, frequently glancing down toward their open sandals, at toes where livid burns from the electrical wires were still visible. \n \n I will call them Najib and Ahmad, though their names, like others in this article, have been changed to protect their safety. Both 23 years old, they looked like gangly young men who should be playing basketball on the street outside their house, or perhaps video games inside. But here in Kandahar City, the linchpin of the U.S. military\u2019s campaign against the Taliban in southern Afghanistan, they had found themselves the victims of America\u2019s Afghan allies. \n \n One afternoon in June, two younger boys who worked at the restaurant, ages 12 and 14, had been stopped by the Afghan National Police while carrying home leftovers from an afternoon wedding. The boys, who were each paid about $60 a month, explained that they always took home leftover meals for their families. But this time they were arrested and accused of bringing food to insurgent fighters hiding outside the city. \n \n Around 11 o\u2019clock that night, police showed up at the restaurant and arrested Najib and Ahmad as well, accusing them of having sent the younger boys out to feed the Taliban. They were taken to police headquarters, where they were handed over to men wearing the mottled gray-green uniforms of the Border Police. \n \n \u201cThey said, \u2018We are going to beat you,\u2019\u201d Ahmad recalled. \n \n The Border Police were a new sight in the city: rough-looking types with wraparound shades and bandoliers of grenades, who could be seen lounging at checkpoints throughout the city and guarding installations such as the governor\u2019s palace. Though restricted by Afghan law to operate only in international airports or within 50 kilometers of the border, they\u2019d entered the city on May 29 when their boss, Brigadier General Abdul Raziq, was appointed acting chief of police in Kandahar province, following the assassination of his predecessor. Raziq was well known as a warlord and suspected drug trafficker who had waged a brutal campaign against the Taliban. He was also a close ally of both President Hamid Karzai and the U.S. military. \n \n Inside the station, the policemen tied a scarf to Najib\u2019s handcuffs and hung him from the ceiling until he felt as if his arms were being pulled from their sockets. Then two men\u2014one in uniform and holding a black metal baton, the other in plain clothes and wielding a length of cable\u2014began beating him across his hips and thighs. A third man, also in plain clothes, questioned Najib: \u201cWhat was the name of the commander you were bringing food to? How often do you bring food to the enemy?\u201d Sobbing, Najib pleaded his innocence. In a nearby room, Ahmad could hear his friend\u2019s screams, though he was spared for the time being. \n \n When the beating was over, Najib and Ahmad were taken outside and thrown into the back of an armored Humvee, where they lay all night with their wrists still tightly cuffed, suffocating in the stiflingly hot, enclosed interior. \n \n Early the next morning, they were taken to the governor\u2019s palace, a long, low white compound fronted by a series of arches, jointly guarded by American soldiers and Border Police, where U.S. and Afghan officials meet on a daily basis. The police brought them around the back, to a filthy room that smelled of human waste, where they were shackled to the wall next to two other prisoners. Then, one at a time, they were taken to a second room, empty except for a gas-powered generator. \n \n Najib went first. He was forced to lie on his back, and wires leading to the generator were attached to toes on both his feet. A group of Border Police crowded around him, jeering and spitting snuff on his face. \u201cTell us the truth,\u201d they commanded. Then they switched on the power. \u201cIt felt,\u201d Najib told me, \u201clike my whole body was filled with moving knives.\u201d \n \n After he passed out from the pain, it was Ahmad\u2019s turn to be tortured. When the two awoke from the ordeal, they were placed in separate rooms. In the evening, they were taken to police headquarters to see Abdul Raziq himself. \n \n Raziq is just 33 years old, slender and boyish-looking, with a square jaw and a widow\u2019s peak that tufts up beneath the embroidered pillbox cap he favors when he\u2019s not in uniform. Uneducated but clever and charismatic, he is, despite his youth, one of the most powerful warlords in southern Afghanistan. He controls a militia of several thousand men, as well as the lucrative drug-smuggling routes that pass through his territory, which includes a key trading town called Spin Boldak, near the border with Pakistan. \n \n That June evening, Najib and Ahmad were seated facing Raziq, who asked them to explain why they had been arrested. They told him about the younger boys who would take leftover food home to their families, and whether it was because they had not confessed, or because their stories had checked out, Raziq ordered them released. \n \n Najib and Ahmad complained to me of suffering nerve damage in their wrists from being cuffed for two days, and both said they\u2019d had problems with their kidneys since the electrocutions: Ahmad, who had the more-severe burns, urinated blood for three days afterward. I examined the wounds on Ahmad\u2019s and Najib\u2019s toes\u2014distinct circular burn marks that were still raw and unhealed\u2014and I spoke with a number of their co-workers, who corroborated their claims. I was also given photos of their injuries taken immediately after they were released, and was told their story independently by a source inside the Kandahar police department unhappy with the abuses taking place under Raziq. \u201cThat\u2019s what happened to them, when they were innocent,\u201d this official said. \u201cThink of what they do to the guilty.\u201d \n \n What happened to Ahmad and Najib is not an isolated incident, but part of a larger pattern of abuse that has occurred wherever Raziq has been in power, first in his outpost of Spin Boldak and now in Kandahar City. Raziq has long been publicly suspected of drug trafficking and corruption; allegations that he and his men have been involved in extrajudicial killings, torture, and illegal imprisonment have been trickling out for years. Raziq categorically denies all such charges, telling The Atlantic, \u201cWhen someone works well, then he finds a lot of enemies who try to ruin his name.\u201d \n \n Last fall, Raziq and his militia were given a starring role in the U.S.-led military offensive into Taliban-controlled areas west of Kandahar City, a campaign that boosted his prestige immensely. Mentored by an American Special Forces team, Raziq\u2019s fighters won public praise from U.S. officers for their combat prowess. After the offensive, Raziq was promoted to brigadier general\u2014a rank requiring a direct order from President Karzai\u2014in a January ceremony at the governor\u2019s mansion. As Ben Moeling, who was until July the State Department\u2019s senior official in Kandahar province, explained to me at the time, the promotion was \u201can explicit recognition of his importance.\u201d \n \n Nor was that promotion the only evidence of Raziq\u2019s continuing ascent. In May, when Karzai appointed him chief of police for Kandahar province, Raziq accepted only on the condition that he also remain in charge of Spin Boldak, the seat of his economic and tribal power. So, in a move that enabled him to retain both jobs, Raziq was appointed \u201cacting\u201d police chief in Kandahar. \n \n While beatings in police custody have been common in Kandahar for as long as there have been police, a number of Afghan and international officials familiar with the situation there told me that Raziq has brought with him a new level of brutality. Since his arrival, Raziq has launched a wave of arrests across the city in coordination with the government intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security. One human-rights official who has conducted prison visits in Kandahar told me that the number of prisoners is up more than 50 percent since Raziq\u2019s arrival. In July, even the U.S. military seemed to have realized that the situation was out of hand, when American and NATO forces quietly halted the transfer of detainees to Afghan authorities in southern Afghanistan, because of credible allegations that prisoners had been severely abused while in police and NDS custody. \n \n Though Raziq has risen in large part through his own skills and ambition, he is also, to a considerable degree, a creation of the American military intervention in Afghanistan. (Prior to 2001, he had worked in a shop in Pakistan.) As part of a countrywide initiative, his men have been trained by two controversial private military firms, DynCorp and Xe, formerly known as Blackwater, at a U.S.-funded center in Spin Boldak, where they are also provided with weapons, vehicles, and communications equipment. Their salaries are subsequently paid through the Law and Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan, a UN-administered international fund, to which the U.S. is the largest contributor. Raziq himself has enjoyed visits in Spin Boldak from such senior U.S. officials as Ambassador Karl Eikenberry and Generals Stanley McChrystal and David Petraeus. \n \n In public, American officials had until recently been careful to downplay Raziq\u2019s alleged abuses. When I met with the State Department\u2019s Moeling at his Kandahar City office in January, he told me, \u201cI think there is certainly a mythology about Abdul Raziq, where there\u2019s a degree of assumption on some of those things. But I have never seen evidence of private prisons or of extrajudicial killings directly attributable to him.\u201d \n \n Yet, as a 2006 State Department report shows, U.S. officials have for years been aware of credible allegations that Raziq and his men participated in a cold-blooded massacre of civilians, the details of which have, until now, been successfully buried. And this, in turn, raises questions regarding whether U.S. officials may have knowingly violated a 1997 law that forbids assistance to foreign military units involved in human-rights violations. \n \n Among a certain group of Kandaharis, the rough outlines of the massacre in question are well known. But nailing down a consistent, detailed version of what took place required two years of cross-checking with a diverse set of sources, including tribal elders, human-rights workers, police officers, and government officials. Most important, I was eventually given direct access to information and photos from a suppressed police investigation into the episode. \n \n On March 20, 2006, Shin Noorzai, a burly smuggler in his mid-30s, arrived with 15 companions at the guesthouse of an acquaintance, Zulmay Tufon, in Kabul. It was the eve of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, occasion for Afghanistan\u2019s biggest festivities, and the capital city\u2019s bedraggled trees were strung with fallen kites and the first buds of spring. \n \n Shin had grown up in southern Afghanistan during the violent, turbulent times of the anti-Soviet and civil wars, and had once been jailed in Pakistan for kidnapping a man. His companions, though, were a mixed group. Some were smugglers, but others were simply friends from the vicinity of the Afghan-Pakistani border, farmers or traders accompanying him on a trip to Mazar-e Sharif, a northern city famous for its new-year celebrations. \n \n According to an acquaintance of Shin\u2019s who was also present at the gathering, he and his friends had arrived at the invitation of another man, Mohammed Naeem Lalai, an old friend of Shin\u2019s who was then working as an officer in the Border Police. It was Lalai who had persuaded Shin and his friends to stop in Kabul on their way to Mazar. As the group sat down to dinner, Shin\u2019s acquaintance, a fellow tribesman, watched uneasily, nervous about the company Shin was keeping. He offered to make the trip with Shin instead. \u201cCome with me to Mazar,\u201d he said to him. \n \n Shin replied that he was going to travel up to Mazar with Lalai. But first, he said, Lalai was taking him to another house where music and entertainment were promised. That night, as darkness fell over Kabul, Shin and his 15 companions left the house with Lalai. Their friends and families would never see them alive again. \n \n At the second house, Shin and his friends were apparently drugged. Unconscious, they were bound and gagged, then loaded into vehicles with official plates, one of them a green Ford Ranger with the seal of the Border Police on its doors. \n \n Driving along back roads, the cars made their way 500 kilometers south to Kandahar province, and by the next morning arrived at Spin Boldak, where Abdul Raziq, then a Border Police colonel in his mid-20s, was waiting for them. \n \n Raziq and Lalai had together lured Shin and his associates to Kabul. The tribes to which Raziq and Shin belonged had been feuding over smuggling routes, and Raziq held Shin responsible for the 2004 killing of his brother. Shin had been a marked man ever since. His 15 companions were just going to be collateral damage. \n \n Raziq and his men loaded their captives into a convoy of Land Cruisers and headed out to a parched, desolate stretch of the Afghan-Pakistani border. About 10 kilometers outside of town, they came to a halt. Shin and the others were hauled out of the trucks and into a dry river gully. There, at close range, Raziq\u2019s forces let loose with automatic weapons, their bullets tearing through the helpless men, smashing their faces apart and soaking their robes with blood. After finishing the job, they unbound the corpses and left them there. \n \n Arriving back in Spin Boldak, Raziq reported to his superiors and to the press that he had intercepted \u201cat least 15\u201d Taliban fighters infiltrating from Pakistan, led by the \u201cmid-level Taliban commander Mullah Shin,\u201d and had killed them in a gun battle. \u201cWe got a tip-off about them coming across the border. We went down there and fought them,\u201d Raziq told the Associated Press the next day. It was the beginning of a cover-up that would go all the way up to President Karzai in Kabul.",

Brumby, according to a report from the Sarasota County Sherriff's Office. \n \n The boy's father, William C. Brumby, fired a round in the last shooting lane at High Noon Gun Range in Sarasota, officials said. After he fired, the spent shell casing hit a wall on his right-hand side, deflecting back and falling into the back of his shirt, said the report. \n \n Using his right hand which was holding the gun, Brumby tried to remove the casing, according to the report. He accidentally pointed the gun behind him, accidentally firing it, officials said. The round hit his son. \n \n Brumby was also at the gun range with his 24-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter at the time of the incident. Neither were injured. \n \n There are currently no charges against Brumby. The investigation is ongoing. \n \n PREVIOUS: A 14-year-old boy died Sunday after he was accidentally shot in the neck at an indoor gun range. The incident occurred at about 3:15 p.m. at High Noon Guns, 4583 Bee Ridge Road, according to a Sarasota County Sheriff's Office report. \n \n The boy, whose name was not released by authorities Sunday, was taken to Sarasota Memorial Hospital with serious injuries, the report said. He later died, authorities said, and the investigation is ongoing. Workers at the gun shop declined to talk to the media Sunday, as did law enforcement. \n \n An October 2013 Herald-Tribune article described the High Noon gun range as possibly being one of the safest indoor shooting ranges ever designed. \n \n High Noon Guns owner John Buchan reportedly traveled the country, examining other indoor ranges, before building his own. The nine-lane operation he designed is quieter than most, the Herald-Tribune reported, thanks to sound-dampening panels, and safer than most, thanks to strategically placed armored steel plates, which are concealed behind wooden walls. Bullets are absorbed by a large mound of granulated rubber material heaped into a pile downrange, which is backed up by more steel plating capable of stopping a 20mm cannon, although High Noon limits the range to handguns and .22 rifles, the story said. The dividers between the shooters feature more armor, concealed by wood \u2014 a feature Buchan chose to increase safety. The walls are lined with sound-dampening panels that are built to both reduce noise and absorb a stray round, preventing ricochets. \u201cIt's as safe as we could make it,\u201d the story quoted Buchan as saying. \n \n Sunday's accidental shooting is the second death at an area gun range in the past year. \n \n Last August, sheriff's deputies were called to the Take Aim Gun Range after a customer killed himself on the firing line with a rented pistol. The man, in his 70s, came to the range in the afternoon to target shoot with two friends. After the three men finished shooting and as the victim's two friends were walking out, the man turned the handgun on himself and fired. He was pronounced dead a short time later.",

See the bottom of this post] In an evening press conference, the NYPD, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams gathered to announce the name of the suspect accused of stabbing two young children in the elevator of their NYCHA building in East New York. They implored the public to contact 1-800-577-TIPS if they have any information about Daniel St. Hubert or call 911 if they see him. \"No one should approach him,\" NYPD Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said. \n \n \"The public is crucial here,\" Mayor de Blasio added, imploring New Yorkers to call in tips via phone or on Crime Stoppers' website. \n \n \"The human dynamic here is so deeply moving, so disturbing,\" he added. \n \n Chief Boyce described St. Hubert as a 27-year-old black male who is 5'9\" and 210 pounds and resides in East New York. He has nine prior arrests and has been on parole since May 23 for a domestic violence incident. Boyce emphasized that St. Hubert is considered \"armed and dangerous.\" \n \n \"Right now we just have his violent nature,\u0097we don't know about his psychiatric history,\" Chief Boyce said. \n \n St. Hubert has been charged with assaulting a police officer and assaulting a Correction officer, which is the reason for his current parole status. \n \n On Sunday just before 6 p.m., the suspect stabbed Prince Joshua \"P.J.\" Avitto, 6, and Mikayla Capers, 7, in a building elevator at the Boulevard Houses on Schenk Avenue. Both children, who were headed outside to get ices, were stabbed repeatedly. P.J. died at the hospital while Mikayala survived\u0097she is unable to speak, but she is responsive. \n \n \"Forensic evidence\" at the crime scene provided the link to St. Hubert. \"We've said nothing about DNA,\" Commissioner Bratton told a reporter who asked whether the suspect's DNA was recovered from the knife. \n \n The officials also said that St. Hubert was scheduled to meet with his parole officer earlier today but did not materialize. \n \n Stabbing suspect's tattoo says Aries. pic.twitter.com/NQSOHY6DJv \u2014 Tina Moore (@NYDNTinaMoore) June 5, 2014 \n \n While it's been reported that St. Hubert may be behind the Friday night fatal stabbing of Tanaya Grant Copeland, which was also in East New York's 75 Precinct, St. Hubert is only named as a suspect in the stabbings of the children, though Commissioner Bratton said St. Hubert has not been ruled out as a suspect in Copeland's death. \n \n \n \n It's believed that St. Hubert changed his appearance and currently looks more like the photo on the left (Chris Robbins/Gothamist) \n \n Commissioner Bratton said that they believe St. Hubert changed his appearance and shaved his head and facial hair, so he may resemble the photo on the left side of the poster. Mayor de Blasio said that P.J.'s parents just want St. Hubert to be arrested before he hurts anyone else, \"I ask all New Yorkers to help in this investigation in any way you can. Do it for this grieving family, do it for all of us, so we can be safe.\" \n \n When asked about his vow to add more officers in and around NYCHA buildings, the mayor said, \"I'll say broadly, the Commissioner has already been making some substantial moves to reinforce some of the percents that need additional help and some of those are areas where there are lot of public housing developments.\" \n \n The mayor added, \"We're going to be working very closely with residents of public housing to keep them safe.\" \n \n Commissioner Bratton indicated that when the current crop of NYPD recruits graduate in July, \"there will be a significant additional compliment of officers going into the housing developments going into the summer months.\" \n \n [UPDATE // 8:36 P.M.] The NYPD said they arrested St. Hubert in Queens.

(New York Daily News) \n \n Police released his name along with several pictures, including one of a large tattoo of a satanic goat\u2019s head with horns, etched under the word \u201cAries\u201d that was on St. Hubert\u2019s right forearm. \n \n Investigators first unearthed his name after getting DNA from the steak knife used in the East New York attack. \n \n Mikayla\u2019s great-grandmother, Regenia Trevathan, said she was comfortable knowing St. Hubert\u2019s fate was in the hands of the NYPD. \n \n \u201cI believe in the justice system and justice will be done,\u201d she said. \u201cI have faith in the NYPD. I\u2019m angry but I put my faith in God, and I put my faith in the city,\u201d she said. \n \n P.J.\u2019s dad, Nicholas Avitto, who lives in the Boulevard Houses where the children were stabbed on Sunday, said earlier that he told cops he believed the killer was a hulking homeless man \u201cI used to see sleeping in my hallway.\u201d \n \n The NYPD had a task force in the neighborhood working around the clock to find St. Hubert, who had a $69,000 price on his head when he was nabbed. \n \n NYPD detectives are seen awaiting a search warrant in front of the home of the mother of Daniel St. Hubert, who was arrested Wednesday night and is accused of stabbing both children. (Sam Costanza for New York Daily News) \n \n The bounty for the killer skyrocketed after the Western Beef supermarket chain kicked in another $50,000 to the existing reward money. \n \n Standing near a makeshift shrine of flowers, balloons, signs and candles before St. Hubert was picked up, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams urged residents to keep their eyes open \u2014 and warned them not to take matters into their own hands. \n \n \u201cWe want vigilance, not vigilantes,\u201d said Adams. \n \n St. Hubert is only wanted right now in relation to the stabbing of the two children Sunday, but police also suspect he might be linked to Friday\u2019s fatal stabbing of 18-year-old Tanaya Grant Copeland four blocks away from the Boulevard Houses. \n \n Police said the knives in the crimes were very similar. St. Hubert hasn\u2019t been charged in Copelend\u2019s murder. \n \n Copeland\u2019s grieving mother said teenagers should beware. \n \n Nicholas Avitto (center), father of Prince Joshua Avitto, took his sons' backpack on a symbolic walk to school in Brooklyn on Wednesday.

(Theodore Parisienne for New York Daily News) Police secure the building where two children were stabbed on Sunday. 6-year-old P.J. Avitto died and 7-year-old Mikayla Capers remains in critical condition. \n \n \u201cThe message I have to every young one out there is one message: be aware, be aware of your surroundings,\u201d Rochelle Copeland said. \n \n \u201cA lot of young people walk around with their cellphones, not focusing on where they are going, and maybe in that one split second, if my daughter wasn't on her phone, maybe she'd have known that her assailant was there.\u201d \n \n With much of East New York on edge, local pols had also asked the FBI to help search for the killer. \n \n P.J. and Mikayla were playing outside Sunday when they were told ices were waiting for them back in the building, police said. They were already in the elevator when the killer barged inside at 5:50 p.m., police said. \n \n The rotund ripper stabbed both children with a steak knife somewhere between the first and fourth floors after telling them to \u201cshut up,\u201d police sources said. \n \n When the elevator returned to the ground floor, the butcher fled, stumbling as he ran, police said. \n \n Despite being stabbed 16 times, Mikayla somehow survived and was in critical condition at New York-Presbyterian Hospital Columbia. \n \n P.J. was found inside the blood-soaked compartment and died later at a local hospital. His parents are planning a Friday funeral. \n \n There were no security cameras in the elevator and lobby of the building where the kids were attacked despite NYCHA earmarking $27 million for the security gear. \n \n Community activist Tony Herbert, president of the National Action Network's East Brooklyn Chapter, said the entire borough was relieved to know a suspect had been caught. \n \n \"(We) can breathe a lot better now that the person who we believe committed the heinous crime of stabbing three of our young people is now behind bars,\" Herbert said. \"We owe the NYPD a great debt of gratitude for a job well done.\"With Kerry Burke, Christian Zhang and Thomas Tracy \n \n rparascandola@nydailynews.com \n \n On a mobile device?

(AP) \u2014 An Ohio man who was missing on Mount St. Helens was found Wednesday on a flank of the peak nearly a week after he set out on a day hike and survived by eating berries and bees, authorities and the man's relatives said. \n \n Matthew B. Matheny, 40, of Warren, Ohio, was in good condition, talking and did not appear to have suffered life-threatening injuries but was flown to a hospital to spend the night as a precaution, the Cowlitz County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. \n \n His parents told reporters outside the Vancouver, Washington, hospital that he was being treated for dehydration and would stay overnight, adding that he ate berries and killed bees that he also ate. \n \n Matheny, 40, was not familiar with the terrain, got lost and had not seen anyone since Aug. 9, they said. \n \n Friends last saw Matthew Matheny when he borrowed a car and headed to Blue Lake Trail on the southwest side of St. Helens. They reported him missing after he failed to return, prompting a search. A sheriff's deputy found the borrowed Subaru Outback at the trailhead on Saturday. \n \n About 30 search-and-rescue personnel, assisted by helicopters, tracking dogs and a drone operated by the sheriff's office searched for him daily. \n \n Searchers on Tuesday decided to focus on a 1-square-mile (2.6-square-kilometer) area based on cellphone signals and a computer model that sought to predict Matheny's movements. \n \n Blue Lake Trail is a short walk through meadows and tall fir trees to Blue Lake, according to the Washington Trails Association, Beyond the lake, hikers can access other trails and ridges, leading to views of Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams. \n \n Matheny was found below a different trail, authorities said. \n \n \"He was in the free forest at this point. He lost the trail, he fell down the steep back,\" said Paul Pepper, another member of the rescue team. ||||| An Ohio man found alive Wednesday on Mount St. Helens after six days lost in the wilderness sustained himself on berries and bees as he tried to find his way, his parents said. \n \n Matthew Matheny, 40, of Warren, Ohio, set off for a hike on the famous southwest Washington mountain last Thursday. Authorities had launched a search and rescue operation that ended successfully when Matheny was airlifted to a Vancouver hospital Wednesday. \n \n He was being treated mostly for dehydration and likely would stay overnight, parents Linda and Carney Matheny said during a press conference outside PeaceHeath Southwest Medical Center. A hospital spokesman said earlier that Matheny was in satisfactory condition, which means his vital signs were good and that he was awake and alert. \n \n Matheny was scraped up, his parents said, including his feet, which were unprotected after the sandals he was wearing broke during the ordeal. His mother said she was going to \"wring his neck\" for his choice of hiking footwear. \n \n Matheny was in Washington state visiting friends and decided to spend Thursday afternoon hiking while his friends were at work, the Mathenys said. He drove a friend's Subaru Outback to the mountain and later couldn't find his way back to the car. His friends reported him missing when he did not return, the Cowlitz County Sheriff's Office said. \n \n Search for missing Ohio man at Mount St. Helens 7 Gallery: Search for missing Ohio man at Mount St. Helens \n \n On Saturday, a Skamania County sheriff's deputy found the Subaru unoccupied at the start of the Blue Lake trail, which is in Cowlitz County. The trail is located off Forest Road 81 and near Mount St. Helens. \n \n Matheny was found about three miles away from the Subaru by a Skamania County-based rescue crew on the flanks of the mountain Wednesday morning. He hadn't seen another person since Thursday and was without water for days, his mother said, but the fluids from the berries may have been enough to keep him going. \n \n Bees chased after Matheny as he moved about on the mountain, his father said, so Matheny killed and ate some. \n \n \"He knew it was a tough situation,\" said Linda Matheny, who arrived in Washington with her husband on Sunday. \"But everyone who has encountered him have told us it's remarkable the condition he's in.\" \n \n About 30 search-and-rescue personnel, assisted by helicopters, tracking dogs and a drone operated by the sheriff's office had been searching for Matheny daily, The Daily News of Longview reported. Matheny's friends and family also have been at the search scene. \n \n Searchers on Tuesday decided to focus on a 1-square-mile area based on cellphone signals and a computer model that sought to predict Matheny's movements. \n \n Charlie Rosenzweig, chief criminal deputy for Cowlitz County Sheriff's Office, called it \"extremely unusual\" that someone would survive such an ordeal, the newspaper reported. \n \n According to the Washington Trails Association, Blue Lake Trail is a short walk through meadows and tall fir trees to Blue Lake. Beyond the lake hikers can access other trails and ridges, leading to views of Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams. \n \n The parents described their son as a former Boy Scout who is interested in fitness and nutrition with a sense of humor and a knack for getting himself into humorous situations. They would recall some of the things he'd said or done to keep their moods light while the search was ongoing, but at times the laughter would turn to tears due to the uncertainty of the search's outcome, Linda Matheny said. \n \n She said when they were called at their northeast Ohio home by authorities on Saturday and told the vehicle their son drove had been found, they waited by the phone for hours hoping the next update would be that he was found. It didn't come. \n \n \"By Sunday morning, we thought, 'We're getting on a plane,'\" the mother said. \n \n They flew to Portland that night, drove north to Washington, stayed in the area and went to the mountain on Monday. \n \n The parents said they're ecstatic their son has been found and also in a bit of shock.

    "document": "Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney drew jeers from black voters Wednesday as he criticized President Barack Obama and pledged to repeal the Democrats' health care overhaul. \n \n N. Scott Phillips of Baltimore, center, and others, listen as Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney speaks at the NAACP annual convention, Wednesday, July 11, 2012,... (Associated Press) \n \n Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney points to someone as he leaves the stage after speaking at the NAACP annual convention, Wednesday, July 11, 2012, in Houston. (AP... (Associated Press) \n \n Romney told the annual meeting of the NAACP that backing him over the Democratic incumbent, who won their overwhelming support in 2008, is in the best interest of their families. He acknowledged his Republican Party doesn't have a perfect record on race relations, but pledged during a sometimes rocky speech that, if elected, he would work with black leaders to put the country back to work. \n \n \"I am going to eliminate every non-essential, expensive program that I can find _ and that includes Obamacare,\" Romney said, drawing his first boos of the day. \n \n Romney stood motionless with a reserved expression for 15 seconds before noting a survey from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as support for his position. His rebuttal was greeted with silence. \n \n Indeed, Romney at times found himself adjusting his prepared remarks _ with its typically business-oriented language _ for his audience and sounded like an like an instructor explaining policy. Once he noted the slow growth of the GDP, the Gross Domestic Product, only to quickly adjust by adding \"the economy.\" \n \n Romney received polite applause at several points during the speech. But he was interrupted again when he flatly accused Obama of failing to spark a more robust economic recovery. \n \n \"I know the president has said he will do those things. But he has not. He cannot. He will not. And his last four years in the White House prove it definitively,\" Romney said as the crowd's murmurs turned to louder groans. \n \n Finally, he stopped amid loud jeers. \n \n \"If you want a president who will make things better in the African-American community, you are looking at him. You take a look,\" Romney shot back. \n \n Romney, running against the nation's first black president, isn't going to win the African American vote. But he made a pitch with a major speech that also was aimed at showing independent and swing voters that he's willing to reach out to diverse audiences _ and demonstrating that his campaign and the Republican Party he leads are inclusive. \n \n Looking to cut into Obama's support among African Americans, Romney called education the \"civil rights issue of our era\" and vowed to put blacks back to work. Citing June labor reports, he noted that the 14.4 percent unemployment rate among blacks is much higher than the 8.2 percent national average. Blacks tend to be unemployed longer and black families have a lower median income, Romney said. \n \n All told, it's a difficult sell _ 95 percent of blacks backed Obama in 2008. But Romney's speech aside, Republicans and Democrats say he's making a statement just by showing up and speaking to the nation's oldest and largest civil rights group. \n \n \"The first thing you need to do is show up, so I ultimately think he's doing the right thing,\" said Rep. Tim Scott, R-S.C., one of two black Republicans in Congress. \"What he's saying to everyone is that he's (running to become) America's president and not just those folks he thinks he can get votes from right now. I think that's a very important statement.\" \n \n \"You've got to get credit for showing up _ for being willing to go _ no question,\" said Karen Finney, a Democratic consultant who worked in the Clinton White House. \"It's more about your actions than it is about what you say.\" \n \n Obama spoke to the group during the 2008 campaign, as did his Republican opponent, Sen. John McCain. Obama doesn't plan to speak this year. Instead, Vice President Joe Biden will address the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People on Thursday. Obama is scheduled to address the National Urban League later this month. \n \n Romney rarely speaks to predominantly black audiences at political events. One exception was a May visit to a charter school in Philadelphia, where he cast fixing the education system as a way to help blacks and other minorities. \n \n In framing education as a civil rights issue, Romney is following in George W. Bush's footsteps. At a sweeping address to the NAACP in 2000, Bush, then the Republican presidential nominee, said the education system should \"leave no child behind\" and labeled the \"soft bigotry of low expectations\" as part of the problem facing black students. \n \n Romney has a personal history with civil rights issues. His father, George, spoke out against segregation in the 1960s and, as governor of Michigan, toured the state's inner cities as race riots wracked Detroit and other urban areas across the country. He went on to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, where he pushed for housing reforms to help blacks. \n \n In recent months, Obama has approached race from an intensely personal perspective. After the shooting of unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin in a Florida neighborhood _ an act many blacks saw as racially motivated _ Obama spoke directly to Martin's parents from the Rose Garden. \"If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon,\" Obama said. \n \n Diminished enthusiasm for the president following the economic downturn could dampen black turnout, and that could make the difference in Southern states Obama won in 2008, particularly North Carolina and Virginia. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Philip Elliott in Washington and Thomas Beaumont in Des Moines, Iowa, contributed to this report. ||||| Mitt Romney told members of the nation\u2019s oldest civil rights organization on Wednesday that he would be a better president for the nation\u2019s black families than President Obama has been. It was a bold appeal aimed at some of Obama\u2019s most ardent supporters and cast Romney as someone willing to forcefully speak his piece even in unfriendly territory. \n \n But the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s speech here received the most hostile reaction from any campaign audience this year, and Romney appeared unsettled by three rounds of loud boos. \n \n \u201cIf you want a president who will make things better in the African American community, you are looking at him,\u201d Romney said. When the crowd booed and hissed, he said, \u201cYou take a look.\u201d \n \n Romney made a direct appeal for support from black voters, who polls show overwhelmingly back the reelection of the nation\u2019s first black president. Romney said his policies would help black families succeed in a sputtering economy, with rising federal debt and poor schools. \n \n He also highlighted his father\u2019s civil rights legacy as governor of Michigan and tried to build a bridge with black voters by talking about their shared faith in God and support of strong families. \n \n \u201cI believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart, and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African American families, you would vote for me for president,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI want you to know that if I did not believe that my policies and my leadership would help families of color \u2014 and families of any color \u2014 more than the policies and leadership of President Obama, I wouldn\u2019t be running for president.\u201d \n \n Romney said that black families have suffered disproportionately under the Obama presidency, noting that the unemployment rate for African Americans rose to 14.4 percent last month, while the overall rate was 8.2 percent. \n \n \u201cIf equal opportunity in America were an accomplished fact, then a chronically bad economy would be equally bad for everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, it\u2019s worse for African Americans in almost every way.\u201d \n \n Romney asked black voters to give him \u201ca fair hearing\u201d and promised that if he is elected, and if the NAACP invites him to return, he would address the group next year and \u201ccount it as a privilege.\u201d \n \n \u201cIn campaigns at their best, voters can expect a clear choice, and candidates can expect a fair hearing \u2014 only more so from a venerable organization like this one,\u201d he said. \n \n The hundreds of African Americans in attendance at the NAACP\u2019s national convention in Houston gave Romney polite although subdued applause. But he received a loud and sustained spattering of boos when he referenced his opposition to the health-care law he called \u201cObamacare,\u201d when he said Obama\u2019s policies are not helping to create jobs and when he said he would be a better president for black families. Many portions of his speech received reserved cheers, such as his promise to defend traditional marriage, and many black voters in the audience stood to applaud him when he finished. \n \n Although Romney appeared surprised by the booing, a campaign aide said he took it in stride, and his advisers said they were not bothered by the reaction. Indeed, they considered the speech gutsy. One adviser said privately that Romney has presented the same agenda to every audience since the start of the campaign and did not back down from advocating policies here that he knew black voters generally oppose, such as repealing Obama\u2019s health-care overhaul. \n \n \u201cWe understand that folks aren\u2019t going to agree with us 100 percent, but at the end of the day, I think Governor Romney\u2019s message was bold, he\u2019s said things that needed to be said, he\u2019s said things he\u2019s always said about ending Obamacare and about bringing this economy back,\u201d Tara Wall, the campaign\u2019s black-outreach adviser, told reporters. \n \n Later Wednesday, at a fundraiser in Montana, Romney said he gave the same speech to the NAACP that he gives to supporters. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t give different speeches to different audiences, all right?\u201d Romney said. \u201cI gave them the same speech. When I mentioned I am going to get rid of Obamacare, they weren\u2019t happy. . . . That\u2019s okay. I want people to know what I stand for, and if I don\u2019t stand for what they want, go vote for someone else. That\u2019s just fine.\u201d \n \n Obama is not addressing the NAACP convention this year, although Vice President Biden is scheduled to speak to the group Thursday. The Obama campaign issued a statement arguing that Romney is \u201cthe wrong choice\u201d for black families. \n \n During the 2008 campaign, Republican nominee John McCain addressed the NAACP. Although President George W. Bush had declined invitations to speak during the first five years of his presidency, he accepted in 2006. In his speech that year, he lamented the Republican Party\u2019s difficult relations with black voters, adding, \u201cI understand that racism still lingers in America.\u201d \n \n On Wednesday, the Obama campaign responded to Romney\u2019s remarks by issuing a statement saying that \u201cAfrican Americans can\u2019t afford Romney Economics.\u201d \n \n It added: \u201cAt the NAACP today, leaders in the African American community recognized the devastating impact Mitt Romney\u2019s policies would have on working families,\u201d campaign spokesman Clo Ewing said in a statement. \u201cHe\u2019d gut investments in education, energy, and infrastructure, and raise taxes on the middle class even as he gives $5 trillion in tax cuts weighted towards millionaires and billionaires. He\u2019d put insurance companies back in charge, threatening the health of more than 30 million Americans who will gain coverage because of the Affordable Care Act. And he refused to use the opportunity today to finally lay out a plan for improving health care or education in this country.\u201d \n \n Romney \u2014 who met privately with NAACP leaders before his remarks \u2014 directly responded to attacks from the Democrats that he would help only the wealthiest Americans. \n \n \u201cThe opposition charges that I and people in my party are running for office to help the rich,\u201d he said. \u201cNonsense. The rich will do just fine whether I am elected or not. The president wants to make this a campaign about blaming the rich. I want to make this a campaign about helping the middle class.\u201d ||||| HOUSTON \u2014 Mitt Romney drew boos, shouts and jeers from attendees while speaking here to the NAACP convention, who balked at his claim that he \u2014 not the country\u2019s first black president \u2014 could best represent black America. \n \n \u201cIf you want the president who will make things better in the African-American community, you\u2019re looking at him,\" Romney said, as he was immediately met with loud shouts. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Romney booed on Obamacare Mitt: See what's 'in my heart' \n \n (See also: Romney at NAACP: Mission impossible?) \n \n The Republican\u2019s call to repeal the health-care overhaul \u2014 which forms a standard part of Romney\u2019s stump speech \u2014 also drew loud cries that temporarily drowned out his speech, causing Romney\u2019s reception by the group to veer from genial to borderline hostile. \n \n \u201cIf our goal is jobs we must stop spending over a trillion dollars more than we earn,\u201d Romney said, speaking to a community that has been hit hard by the economy. \u201cTo do this, I will eliminate non-essential programs like Obamacare.\u201d \n \n While the somewhat hostile reception is likely to dominate the cable news cycle and be used as evidence by Romney\u2019s detractors that he\u2019s out of touch with blacks and working-class Americans, the majority of the Republican\u2019s talking points received polite applause, even in a period of heightened racial tension after the U.S. House recently voted to hold in contempt the country\u2019s first black attorney general. \n \n \u201cI believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart, and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African-American families, you would vote for me for president,\u201d said. \u201cI want you to know that if I did not believe that my policies and my leadership would help families of color \u2014 and families of any color \u2014 more than the policies and leadership of President Obama, I would not be running for president.\u201d \n \n Romney campaign aides dismissed the at times rowdy reception and said that \u201cthe door is open\u201d now for Romney to make more inroads in the black community. \n \n They cast the NAACP speech as an introduction to a community that they know is overwhelmingly expected to favor President Barack Obama in the fall \u2014 and a successful one at that. \n \n \u201cHe had a standing ovation at the end. There was a lot more applause than disagreement,\u201d said Tara Wall, a senior Romney adviser who was recently hired to reach out to African-Americans. \u201cObviously there\u2019s going to be some disagreement. We understand that folks are not going to agree with us 100 percent. But at the end of the day, I think Governor Romney\u2019s message was bold. He said what needed to be said.\u201d \n \n Wall said she didn\u2019t believe Romney\u2019s ideas were unpopular, even among the black community. \n \n \u201cI think again you may have been sitting in a different section than I was sitting in,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cI heard applause for a number of things that this governor communicated\u2026I think coming in here he said there was going to be disagreement\u2026You still at the end of the day are not going to back down to what he\u2019s asserted all along when it comes to repealing Obamacare.\u201d ||||| HOUSTON \u2014 Less than four years after President Obama swept into the White House with the overwhelming support of black voters, Mitt Romney appeared on Wednesday before the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People with a bold claim: \u201cIf you want a president who will make things better in the African-American community, you are looking at him,\u201d Mr. Romney said. \n \n His assertion was met with cackles and boos \u2014 as well as some tepid applause \u2014 and was emblematic of his entire speech, in which he tried to appeal to African-Americans, while still offering some tough medicine and policy prescriptions unpopular with them. \n \n In his roughly 25-minute speech at the N.A.A.C.P.\u2019s annual convention here in Houston, Mr. Romney promised to fight teachers\u2019 unions and repeal the president\u2019s health care plan, both positions that are unpopular among blacks. \n \n When he said would \u201celiminate every nonessential expensive program I can find, that includes Obamacare,\u201d the crowd began to boo \u2014 the first of several instances of vocal disagreement. Mr. Romney grinned nervously and deviated slightly from his prepared remarks, as he tried to explain his position. \n \n He also said he would \u201cdefend traditional marriage.\u201d Though many African-Americans have not warmed to same-sex marriage, the N.A.A.C.P. passed a resolution in May supporting marriage equality. \n \n \u201cI believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart, and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African-American families, you would vote for me for president,\u201d Mr. Romney said. \n \n Mr. Romney\u2019s speech was blunt and delivered with little of the typical rhetorical flourishes and soaring language that is often aimed at celebrating the history of the civil rights movement. \n \n Instead, the presumptive Republican nominee came straight to the point, awkwardly acknowledging the lack of support among African-Americans for a candidate from his party. \n \n But even as he accepted that reality, Mr. Romney appeared determined to deliver a tough critique of Mr. Obama\u2019s economic policies in the face of a restless crowd that at several points booed him. \n \n To the audience, he suggested that their support for the president was misplaced, a mistaken assumption that his policies would make their lives better. In fact, Mr. Romney said, African-Americans would do better if he was president. \n \n \u201cIf I did not believe that my policies and my leadership would help families of color \u2014 and families of any color \u2014 more than the policies and leadership of President Obama, I would not be running for president,\u201d he said. \n \n His message \u2014 offered with little veneer \u2014 was basically this: you should not support Mr. Obama just because he is an African-American. \n \n Though Mr. Obama, the country\u2019s first African-American president, won 95 percent of the black vote in 2008, Mr. Romney is not ceding any ground in what his campaign anticipates will be a close election in November. The black vote, which is still solidly in Mr. Obama\u2019s column, could prove crucial in swing states like North Carolina and Virginia. \n \n \u201cThis is an honor to address you, and one I had not expected, and one I value very highly,\u201d Mr. Romney said, before later promising that, as president, he would return to the convention next year, if invited. \n \n In May, Mr. Romney hired a consultant, Tara Wall, to help with outreach to black voters, and he also visited an inner-city charter school in West Philadelphia, where he was heckled. But his appearance on Wednesday was his most pointed wooing of black voters this campaign, even as he offered a speech that was less conciliatory in tone that many in the crowd had expected. \n \n Mr. Romney also offered an economic pitch to the group, similar to the one he has been making to Hispanic voters \u2014 another critical voting bloc, especially in swing states like Colorado, Florida, Nevada and Virginia. \n \n \u201cThe unemployment rate, the duration of unemployment, average income, median family wealth are all worse in the black community,\u201d he said. \u201cIn June, while the overall unemployment rate remained stuck at 8.2 percent, the unemployment rate for African-Americans actually went up, from 13.6 percent to 14.4 percent.\u201d \n \n Last month, speaking to an annual conference of Hispanic officials, Mr. Romney addressed the topic of immigration \u2014 both legal and illegal \u2014 but ultimately gave a tweaked version of his economy-driven stump speech. \n \n Many in the audience gave Mr. Romney credit for showing up and speaking to the group, but said they were frustrated with certain aspects of his speech. \n \n \u201cI give him thumbs up for being courageous,\u201d said William Braxton, 59, a retired attendee from Charles County, Md., with a chuckle. \u201cHe was courageous without a doubt.\u201d \n \n But Mr. Braxton said he took issue with Mr. Romney\u2019s claim that he would be the best president to serve black citizens. \n \n \u201cOh my God, I was shocked,\u201d Mr. Braxton said. \u201cNever ever have I heard him say anything about how he would help the poor or underprivileged, let alone the black community. Maybe his view is that he could tell us what we want to hear and we\u2019re supposed to swallow it.\u201d \n \n Donna Payne, 48, of Washington, D.C., who was at the convention as a representative of the Human Rights Campaign, said that she thought Mr. Romney \u201cdid the best he could,\u201d before dissolving in laughter. \n \n \u201cTo say he would repeal Obama\u2019s health care plan is absolutely a joke,\u201d Ms. Payne said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe he had the nerve to even bring up repealing the plan in the middle of speaking to an audience that fought hard for the health care plan and for coverage. It\u2019s a total misread of who you\u2019re talking to.\u201d \n \n In recent national polls, Mr. Obama still overwhelmingly leads Mr. Romney among black voters, many of whom are suspicious of Mr. Romney\u2019s record on civil rights and diversity, especially when he was the governor of Massachusetts. Upon taking office, for his instance, he eliminated the state\u2019s Office of Affirmative Action. \n \n Mr. Romney is also a member of the Mormon Church, which until 1978 barred blacks from entering the priesthood. But Mr. Romney\u2019s father, George Romney, a former governor of Michigan, was known for his aggressive stance on civil rights. The elder Mr. Romney refused to support Barry Goldwater in 1964 because he was worried about his extreme rhetoric and his campaign\u2019s appeals to the Southern white segregationist vote, and he later used his perch as the secretary of Housing and Urban Development to try to integrate the suburbs. \n \n Mr. Romney mentioned his father near the end of his speech, mentioning several instances of his civil rights work and concluding: \u201cHe was a man of the fairest instincts, and a man of faith who knew that every person was a child of God.\u201d \n \n Though Mr. Obama was invited to address the group as well, he canceled, citing a scheduling conflict, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will speak at the convention on Thursday.",

The remote location has enabled researchers to study the evolution of biodiversity due to natural selection. \n \n The direct observation of the origin of this new species occurred during field work carried out over the last four decades by B. Rosemary and Peter Grant, two scientists from Princeton, on the small island of Daphne Major. \n \n \"The novelty of this study is that we can follow the emergence of new species in the wild,\" said B. Rosemary Grant, a senior research biologist, emeritus, and a senior biologist in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. \"Through our work on Daphne Major, we were able to observe the pairing up of two birds from different species and then follow what happened to see how speciation occurred.\" \n \n In 1981, a graduate student working with the Grants on Daphne Major noticed the newcomer, a male that sang an unusual song and was much larger in body and beak size than the three resident species of birds on the island. \n \n \"We didn't see him fly in from over the sea, but we noticed him shortly after he arrived. He was so different from the other birds that we knew he did not hatch from an egg on Daphne Major,\" said Peter Grant, the Class of 1877 Professor of Zoology, Emeritus, and a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, emeritus. \n \n The researchers took a blood sample and released the bird, which later bred with a resident medium ground finch of the species Geospiz fortis, initiating a new lineage. The Grants and their research team followed the new \"Big Bird lineage\" for six generations, taking blood samples for use in genetic analysis. \n \n In the current study, researchers from Uppsala University analyzed DNA collected from the parent birds and their offspring over the years. The investigators discovered that the original male parent was a large cactus finch of the species Geospiza conirostris from Espa\u00f1ola island, which is more than 100 kilometers (about 62 miles) to the southeast in the archipelago. \n \n The remarkable distance meant that the male finch was not able to return home to mate with a member of his own species and so chose a mate from among the three species already on Daphne Major. This reproductive isolation is considered a critical step in the development of a new species when two separate species interbreed. \n \n The offspring were also reproductively isolated because their song, which is used to attract mates, was unusual and failed to attract females from the resident species. The offspring also differed from the resident species in beak size and shape, which is a major cue for mate choice. As a result, the offspring mated with members of their own lineage, strengthening the development of the new species. \n \n Researchers previously assumed that the formation of a new species takes a very long time, but in the Big Bird lineage it happened in just two generations, according to observations made by the Grants in the field in combination with the genetic studies. \n \n All 18 species of Darwin's finches derived from a single ancestral species that colonized the Gal\u00e1pagos about one to two million years ago. The finches have since diversified into different species, and changes in beak shape and size have allowed different species to utilize different food sources on the Gal\u00e1pagos. A critical requirement for speciation to occur through hybridization of two distinct species is that the new lineage must be ecologically competitive -- that is, good at competing for food and other resources with the other species -- and this has been the case for the Big Bird lineage. \n \n \"It is very striking that when we compare the size and shape of the Big Bird beaks with the beak morphologies of the other three species inhabiting Daphne Major, the Big Birds occupy their own niche in the beak morphology space,\" said Sangeet Lamichhaney, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University and the first author on the study. \"Thus, the combination of gene variants contributed from the two interbreeding species in combination with natural selection led to the evolution of a beak morphology that was competitive and unique.\" \n \n The definition of a species has traditionally included the inability to produce fully fertile progeny from interbreeding species, as is the case for the horse and the donkey, for example. However, in recent years it has become clear that some closely related species, which normally avoid breeding with each other, do indeed produce offspring that can pass genes to subsequent generations. The authors of the study have previously reported that there has been a considerable amount of gene flow among species of Darwin's finches over the last several thousands of years. \n \n One of the most striking aspects of this study is that hybridization between two distinct species led to the development of a new lineage that after only two generations behaved as any other species of Darwin's finches, explained Leif Andersson, a professor at Uppsala University who is also affiliated with the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences and Texas A&M; University. \"A naturalist who came to Daphne Major without knowing that this lineage arose very recently would have recognized this lineage as one of the four species on the island. This clearly demonstrates the value of long-running field studies,\" he said. \n \n It is likely that new lineages like the Big Birds have originated many times during the evolution of Darwin's finches, according to the authors. The majority of these lineages have gone extinct but some may have led to the evolution of contemporary species. \"We have no indication about the long-term survival of the Big Bird lineage, but it has the potential to become a success, and it provides a beautiful example of one way in which speciation occurs,\" said Andersson. \"Charles Darwin would have been excited to read this paper.\" \n \n ### \n \n The study was supported by the Galapagos National Parks Service, the Charles Darwin Foundation, the National Science Foundation, the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Swedish Research Council. \n \n The study, \"Rapid hybrid speciation in Darwin's finches,\" by Sangeet Lamichhaney, Fan Han, Matthew T. Webster, Leif Andersson, B. Rosemary Grant and Peter R. Grant, was published in the journal Science on Nov. 23, 2017. \n \n Uppsala University contributed to the content of this press release. ||||| For the first time, scientists have been able to observe something amazing: the evolution of a completely new species, in the wild, in real-time. And it took just two generations. \n \n Now, genomic sequencing and the analysis of physical characteristics have confirmed the new species of Darwin's finch, endemic to a small island called Daphne Major in the Gal\u00e1pagos. Its discoverers have nicknamed it Big Bird. \n \n There are at least 15 species of Darwin's finches, so named because their diversity helped famed naturalist Charles Darwin figure out his theory of evolution by natural selection - that is, mutations can help species become better adapted to their environment, and be passed down to subsequent generations. \n \n It's two of these species that came together in what is called species hybridisation to create an entirely new one. \n \n Here's what Big Bird looks like. (\u00a9 P. R. Grant) \n \n While on expedition on the Daphne Major island, Peter and B. Rosemary Grant, biologists at Princeton University, noticed the presence of a non-native interloper, Geospiza conirostris. \n \n It's also known as the large cactus finch, and is native to other Galapagos islands, namely Espa\u00f1ola, Genovesa, Darwin, and Wolf. \n \n As one of the larger species of Darwin's finches, and with a different song than the three native Daphne Major species, the newcomer - a male - stood out. \n \n \"We didn't see him fly in from over the sea, but we noticed him shortly after he arrived. He was so different from the other birds that we knew he did not hatch from an egg on Daphne Major,\" Peter Grant said. \n \n But then it mated with two females of one of those native species, Geospiza fortis, the medium ground finch. And the mating produced offspring. \n \n Mating between different species that results in offspring isn't that unusual - famous examples include mules, the product of mating between a male donkey and a mare. There are also ligers, a cross between a male lion and female tiger. \n \n G. conirostris (left) and G. fortis (right). (\u00a9 K. T. Grant and B. R. Grant) \n \n But hybrid species are often sterile, or reproduce with difficulty - and that did not prove to be the case with these new chicks. A new lineage began - it had to. \n \n The birds had a different song from G. fortis, as well as different beak size and shape, and these are what the finches use to attract mates. Reproductively, the new species was completely isolated, and had to mate within its own kind to survive. \n \n But it was an uphill battle. During droughts on the island in 2002-2003, when the new lineage was in its fourth generation, all but two of the birds died. \n \n Then they rallied. \n \n \"When the rains came again, the brother and sister mated with each other and produced 26 offspring,\" Rosemary Grant said in an interview last year. \n \n \"All but nine survived to breed - a son bred with his mother, a daughter with her father, and the rest of the offspring with each other - producing a terrifically inbred lineage.\" \n \n Because the hybrid finches were bigger than the native populations, they were able to access previously unexploited food choices, and survive. At the Grants' most recent visit to the island in 2012, they counted 23 individuals and 8 breeding pairs of the birds. \n \n This success means, the researchers noted, that hybridisation could have occurred many times in Darwin's finches in the past, resulting in new species that either became extinct or evolved to become the species we know today. \n \n \"A naturalist who came to Daphne Major without knowing that this lineage arose very recently would have recognised this lineage as one of the four species on the island,\" said Leif Andersson of Uppsala University in Sweden, who conducted the genetic analysis. \"This clearly demonstrates the value of long-running field studies.\" \n \n Charles Darwin would have been delighted. \n \n If you want to read more about the Grants' work, you can't go past the Pulitzer-winning The Beak of the Finch. \n \n And you can find the new paper in the journal Science. ||||| Image caption This is an image of the Big Bird lineage, which arose through the breeding of two distinct parent species: G. fortis and G. conirostris \n \n A population of finches on the Galapagos has been discovered in the process of becoming a new species. \n \n This is the first example of speciation that scientists have been able to observe directly in the field. \n \n Researchers followed the entire population of finches on a tiny Galapagos island called Daphne Major, for many years, and so they were able to watch the speciation in progress. \n \n The research was published in the journal Science. \n \n The group of finch species to which the Big Bird population belongs are collectively known as Darwin's finches and helped Charles Darwin to uncover the process of evolution by natural selection. \n \n In 1981, the researchers noticed the arrival of a male of a non-native species, the large cactus finch. \n \n Professors Rosemary and Peter Grant noticed that this male proceeded to mate with a female of one of the local species, a medium ground finch, producing fertile young. \n \n Almost 40 years later, the progeny of that original mating are still being observed, and number around 30 individuals. \n \n \"It's an extreme case of something we're coming to realise more generally over the years. Evolution in general can happen very quickly,\" said Prof Roger Butlin, a speciation expert who wasn't involved in the study. \n \n What makes a species? \n \n This new finch population is sufficiently different in form and habits to the native birds, as to be marked out as a new species, and individuals from the different populations don't interbreed. \n \n Prof Butlin told the BBC that people working on speciation credit the Grant professors with altering our understanding of rapid evolutionary change in the field. \n \n In the past, it was thought that two different species must be unable to produce fertile offspring in order to be defined as such. But in more recent years, it has been established that many birds and other animals that we consider to be unique species are in fact able to interbreed with others to produce fertile young. \n \n \"We tend not to argue about what defines a species anymore, because that doesn't get you anywhere,\" said Prof Butlin. What he says is more interesting is understanding the role that hybridisation can have in the process of creating new species, which is why this observation of Galapagos finches is so important. \n \n The researchers think that the original male must have flown 65 miles from the large cactus finches' home island of Espa\u00f1ola. That's a very long way for a small finch to fly, and so it would be very unlikely for the bird to make a successful return flight. \n \n Image caption A member of the G. fortis species, one of two that interbred to give rise to the Big Bird lineage \n \n Image caption A finch belonging to the G. conirostris species. It's the other half of the pairing that gave rise to the Big Bird population \n \n By identifying one way that new species can arise, and following the entire population, the researchers state this as an example of speciation occurring in a timescale we can observe. \n \n In most cases, the offspring of cross-species matings are poorly adapted to their environment. But in this instance, the new finches on Daphne Major are larger than other species on the island, and have taken hold of new and unexploited food. \n \n For this reason, the researchers are calling the animals the \"Big Bird population\". \n \n To scientifically test whether the Big Bird population was genetically distinct from the three species of finch native to the island, Peter and Rosemary Grant collaborated with Prof Leif Andersson of Sweden's Uppsala University who analysed the population genetically for the new study. \n \n Prof Andersson told BBC News: \"The surprise was that we would expect the hybrid would start to breed with one of the other species on the island and be absorbed\u2026 we have confirmed that they are a closed breeding group.\" \n \n Due to an inability to recognise the songs of the new males, native females won't pair with this new species. \n \n Image copyright FRANS LANTING, MINT IMAGES / SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Image caption The finches led Darwin to his theory of natural selection, as outlined in On The Origin of Species \n \n And in this paper, new genetic evidence shows that after two generations, there was complete reproductive isolation from the native birds. As a result, they are now reproductively - and genetically - isolated. So they have been breeding exclusively with each other over the years. \n \n \"What we are saying is that this group of birds behave as a distinct species. If you didn't know anything about [Daphne Major's] history and a taxonomist arrived on this island they would say there are four species on this island,\" said Prof Andersson. \n \n There is no evidence that they will breed again with the native medium ground finch, but even if they did, they now have a larger size and can exploit new opportunities. Those advantageous traits may be maintained by natural selection. \n \n So hybridisation can lead to speciation, simply through the addition of one individual to a population. It may therefore be a way for new traits to evolve quickly. \n \n \"If you just wait for mutations causing one change at a time, then it would make it more difficult to raise a new species that way. But hybridisation may be more effective than mutation,\" said Prof Butlin. \n \n Follow Rory on Twitter.",

The news, which Winfrey delivered in person to her Harpo staff on Tuesday morning, comes two months after her burgeoning cable network moved into a new space in West Hollywood. Though the Chicago lease continues through April 2016, Winfrey and her key executives intend to stop the back-and-forth routine they've been balancing for nearly half a decade sooner than that. \n \n In a phone interview from the Harpo offices in Chicago, Winfrey acknowledges a mix of excitement and nostalgia. \"[Chicago has] been everything for me. I've spent more hours in this building than I have any other building on Earth. ... We were here when there was nothing but hoes and rats on the street, and now it's one of the hottest neighborhoods [in Chicago],\" she says, noting that OWN will stop shooting shows there as of Tuesday. \"The time had come to downsize this part of the business and to move forward. It will be sad to say goodbye, but I look ahead with such a knowing that what the future holds is even more than I can see.\" \n \n Winfrey, 61, along with OWN and Harpo presidents Sheri Salata and Erik Logan, emphasize the significance of having their team all under one roof, particularly when the 4-year-old network is still in an early growth stage, expanding both its offerings and its reach. Though it's narrower than many top cable offerings, OWN, co-owned by Winfrey and Discovery Communications, has posted three consecutive years of growth and, in February, ranked as the No. 20 ad-supported cable network among women. It fares even better among its African-American core audience, with ratings up 12 percent year-over-year in that demo. The closure of Harpo, which had produced more than 800 hours of original programming exclusively for OWN, will impact roughly 200 employees, who will remain employed through December. \n \n While running OWN will remain a primary focus for Winfrey going forward, she has and will continue to pursue interests outside of the executive suite, too, including a cadre of film projects (she acted in Lee Daniels\u2019 The Butler and Selma, which she also produced) and this past fall\u2019s eight-city \"Oprah's The Life You Want\" arena tour. More recently, Winfrey announced that she'd be moving in front of the camera at her eponymous network, with a recurring role in Queen Sugar, from Selma\u2019s Ava DuVernay. \u201cThat\u2019s been my goal,\u201d she says of making her OWN acting debut, calling the drama opportunity a \u201cseminal moment.\u201d \n \n See more The Resurgence of Oprah Winfrey \n \n In fact, the high-end DuVernay drama, inspired by Natalie Baszile's acclaimed novel of the same name, is key to Winfrey's ongoing scripted push at OWN. DuVernay is set to deliver a pilot draft script to Winfrey in the coming days, having spent her post-Oscar week at Winfrey\u2019s Maui writers\u2019 cottage pulling it together. The drama will chronicle a spirited woman who leaves her upscale Los Angeles lifestyle behind to claim an inheritance from her recently departed father \u2014 an 800-acre sugarcane farm in the heart of Louisiana. \n \n Once a shooting schedule for Queen is set, Winfrey will be able to figure out what more she can \u2014 and cannot \u2014 do as an actor. Despite recent reports of her circling the upcoming Broadway revival of 'night, Mother, in which she would have played a mother struggling to prevent her daughter from killing herself, she says she has opted against it. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to be in the space of suicide every night for six months,\u201d she explains, adding: \u201cI\u2019d like something with a happier ending.\u201d \n \n Without rattling off titles, Winfrey reveals that she will be heading to New York in the next couple of weeks to take a closer look at two other potential plays. Additionally, she\u2019s set to reunite with Daniels for his upcoming biopic, Pryor, in which she\u2019ll portray Richard Pryor\u2019s grandmother Marie Carter. (Her own Los Angeles-based Harpo Films will remain active, too, with a development slate that includes Henrietta Lacks at HBO and Oprah's Book Club 2.0 picks Ruby and The Invention of Wings.) And though she says she has \"no plans\" to embark on another weekend fan experience tour \u2014 an experience she calls \"spectacularly rewarding\" \u2014 she does intend to do international speaking engagements. \n \n See more Hollywood's 100 Favorite Films \n \n Among the other things still on her to-do list: more scripted programming at the network. \u201cFor all of those years on the Oprah Show, we were able to encapsulate the stories that connected to our audience in a way that nobody else could,\u201d says Winfrey. \u201cI love telling the real stories of peoples\u2019 lives, and now we get to create them, make them up, and I get to be part of them as an actor and producer.\u201d \n \n At OWN, Queen Sugar will join a quartet of Tyler Perry-scripted series \u2014 all of which recently secured additional episode orders \u2014 as well as the upcoming two-night Octavia Spencer-led miniseries, Tulsa, already in development. The latter, the network's first in the genre, centers on the story of the largest race riot in U.S. history, in which more than 300 people are believed to have been murdered. OWN will continue to develop projects in other areas, too, including a seven-part event series, Belief, which will explore humankind\u2019s ongoing search to connect with something greater than ourselves when it bows this fall. The remainder of Winfrey's lineup, including Master Class and Iyanla Fix My Life, will now be produced within Los Angeles-based OWN. \n \n The Harpo move comes nearly a year after real estate developer Sterling Bay Cos. closed a deal for the production company's four building facility, reportedly paying a combined $30.5 million. At that time, Sterling agreed to lease the space back to Harpo for two years. \"We have been fortunate to have this spectacular city of Chicago as our home for over 25 years,\" said Logan and Salata in a joint statement, \"and are thankful to everybody who has been a part of this great company.\u201d \n \n A small group of the Chicago-based Harpo staffers will join the approximately 140 OWN employees who have moved into the network's newly constructed three-floor space at West Hollywood's The Lot. The latter not only offers sound-stages and post-production studios, which OWN's previous Miracle Mile location did not, but also a rich Hollywood history: \u201cThe idea of being on the lot where Natalie Wood filmed West Side Story or Marilyn Monroe did Some Like it Hot,\u201d says Winfrey, \u201cyou automatically feel like you\u2019re part of a community that\u2019s larger than you.\u201d ||||| It's a wrap for Harpo Studios in Chicago. \n \n The facility, which Oprah Winfrey opened in 1990 to house her talk show empire, helped turn Chicago into a bustling television center and the West Loop into a resurgent urban neighborhood. But on Tuesday, she came to Chicago to tell employees that Harpo was closing for good. \n \n Production is migrating to the West Coast, four years behind Winfrey, who left town to start her own cable network, OWN, in 2011. The work, which had dwindled to mostly postproduction editing on a handful of shows, is expected to wind down in phases, leaving about 200 staffers out of a job and Chicago's place in the television industry diminished. \n \n The lease on the space, where Winfrey's eponymous show was recorded for decades, runs until April 2016. The last day of production will be Dec. 11, sources said. \n \n Oprah Winfrey is leaving Chicago...and 200 employees behind Oprah Winfrey is bidding her longtime home, Chicago, adieu, now that her Windy City-based Harpo studios are transitioning full-time to their new location in West Hollywood. (Inform) Oprah Winfrey is bidding her longtime home, Chicago, adieu, now that her Windy City-based Harpo studios are transitioning full-time to their new location in West Hollywood. (Inform) See more videos \n \n Harpo Studios had been at the center of Winfrey's broadcast universe since it opened, hosting her syndicated daily talk show through its finale in 2011. Chicago-based real estate developer Sterling Bay Cos. bought the four-building Near West Side facility in 2014, paying a combined $30.5 million for about 170,000 square feet of space. \n \n Executives with the Oprah Winfrey Network and Harpo Studios said the Chicago studios will be moved to network facilities in West Hollywood, Calif., by December. \n \n About 200 people are employed by Harpo Studios in Chicago, doing production work for OWN cable shows such as \"Super Soul Sunday,\" \"Oprah's Master Class,\" \"Oprah: Where Are They Now,\" \"Oprah Prime\" and \"Iyanla: Fix My Life.\" That work will continue in Chicago for now, but most of those jobs will be phased out as production on the shows transitions to OWN, a Harpo spokeswoman said Tuesday. \n \n Active filming on the Chicago studio lot, minimal in recent years, ended as of Tuesday, a Harpo spokeswoman said. \n \n A small group of Harpo employees from Chicago have been offered jobs with OWN in Los Angeles, according to sources. Others may have the opportunity to continue working on the shows on a freelance basis. But by December, only a skeleton crew will remain in Chicago, charged with shutting down Harpo Studios. \n \n Harpo had about 580 employees and full-time contractors when Winfrey wrapped up her daily talk show, according to studio executives. \n \n \"We have been fortunate to have this spectacular city of Chicago as our home for over 25 years and are thankful to everybody who has been a part of this great company,\" Erik Logan and Sheri Salata, presidents of OWN and Harpo Studios, said in a statement. \n \n Winfrey held an emotional meeting at Harpo Studios at 9 a.m. Tuesday, sources said. The agenda was not announced, but it was expected by some employees, especially those who had seen production wane from the studio's heyday, when \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" was the hottest ticket in town and the envy of both coasts. \n \n Returning to announce the closing of the home that launched her television empire, Winfrey addressed the remaining staffers, thanking them and telling them the decision did not come lightly. She reminisced about 25 years in the building but said that from a business standpoint, it made more sense to consolidate everything under one roof in Los Angeles. \n \n \"It was kind of surreal for a lot of people,\" said a 10-year production veteran, who asked that his name not be used. \"We all knew it was coming, but we were holding out hope that there would be a smaller crew remaining here, but that's not going to be the case moving forward.\" \n \n The exodus of Harpo Studios may be a tipping point for TV production in Chicago, which has seen both wins and losses in recent years. \"The Jerry Springer Show\" moved from Chicago to Connecticut in 2009, but comedian Steve Harvey began recording his syndicated daytime talk show in Chicago in 2012. Prime time shows like NBC's \"Chicago Fire\" and \"Chicago P.D.\" also will help keep the city on the TV production map. But staffers are doubtful that there will be enough jobs in Chicago to handle the influx of Harpo veterans. \n \n \"There's going to be a lot of talent on the streets in Chicago. I'm not sure there's enough open positions to absorb everybody here,\" the staffer said. \"I think there's going to have to be a lot of people that are going to have to look to moving out to the coasts, New York or LA, where most of the production is still being done.\" \n \n In a statement, Winfrey said: \"Harpo Studios in Chicago was not just my home but also my life for nearly 30 years. I've spent more time there than anywhere else. I am so proud of what we created. It has been a blessing in my life and I thank everyone who has been a part of this great run. I am now looking ahead to inhabiting the new space on The Lot in California and carrying on the legacy of Harpo Studios with OWN programming.\" \n \n OWN, a venture between Winfrey and Discovery Communications, struggled initially after its launch in January 2011. It has since gained traction, posting double-digit ratings increases for three consecutive years, executives said. OWN is available in 85 million homes. \n \n Although Winfrey moved West with OWN, Harpo Studios was integral to the cable network's launch. It also was home to OWN's most prominent year-one flameout, \"The Rosie Show,\" a talk show hosted by O'Donnell and filmed in Chicago. Winfrey pulled the plug on \"Rosie\" in March 2012 after five months of tweaking and downsizing failed to boost anemic ratings. That led to staffing reductions and a lesser role for Harpo Studios, culminating in Tuesday's announced closing. \n \n Harpo is leasing two of the four buildings on the campus. Sterling Bay remains in discussions with potential tenants and redevelopment partners. A decision about the future of the property has not been made, the West Loop-based real estate developer said. \n \n Beyond her television legacy, Winfrey leaves behind a monument to the \"Oprah Effect\" in the form of the massive facility she built, and the West Loop neighborhood she helped revive. \n \n A large part of her former complex is occupied by 120 Sports, an over-the-top streaming national sports network that employs 150 people and has major backers, including Time Inc., and Bulls and White Sox Chairman Jerry Reinsdorf. It is leasing a sprawling 17,000-square-foot space once occupied by O'Donnell's short-lived talk show. \n \n While the neighborhood surrounding the studio may feel an economic pinch from the loss of Harpo jobs, boosters are hopeful it will continue to thrive. \n \n Roger Romanelli, executive director of the Randolph/Fulton Market Association, a community organization, said Harpo had \"brought so much bounty\" to the West Loop. It drew tourists, made people feel safer walking around day and night, and its employees shopped at local businesses.",

And I'm greatly honored to host this lunch, to be joined by the leaders of C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, Uganda, and South Africa. In particular, I want to thank President Cond\u00e9, who is representing the African Union. Thank you. Thank you. \n \n In this room, I see partners for promoting prosperity and peace on a range of economic, humanitarian, and security issues. We hope to extend our economic partnerships with countries who are committed to self-reliance and to fostering opportunities for job creation in both Africa and the United States. \n \n Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich. I congratulate you. They're spending a lot of money. But it does -- it has a tremendous business potential and representing huge amounts of different markets. And for American firms it's really become a place that they have to go -- that they want to go. \n \n of the world\u2019s ten fastest-growing economies are in Africa. Increasing American trade and investment across diverse industries -- including agriculture, energy, transportation, healthcare, travel, and tourism -- will further transform lives throughout the continent. Secretary Tillerson and the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation are already considering an investment worth hundreds of millions of dollars in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, which has made impressive economic reforms. Really, you've done a tremendous job. \n \n We also hope that African firms -- like the company Sasol --consider making investments in the United States. Sasol, as an example, is building a $9 billion petrochemical plant in Louisiana, which will bring new jobs to the state and, really, hardworking Americans will be manning those jobs. \n \n we cannot have prosperity if we're not healthy. We will continue our partnership on critical health initiatives. Uganda has made incredible strides in the battle against HIV/AIDS. In Guinea and Nigeria, you fought a horrifying Ebola outbreak. Namibia\u2019s health system is increasingly self-sufficient. My Secretary of Health and Human Services will be traveling to Africa to promote our Global Health Security Agenda. \n \n Yet, we know that our prosperity depends, above all, on peace. The United States will partner with the countries and organizations, like the African Union, that lead successful efforts to end violence, to prevent the spread of terrorism, and to respond to humanitarian crises. I commend your troops currently serving in the field. Very brave. Very, very brave what they\u2019re going through. \n \n you well know, too many people are suffering from conflict in Africa. In the Central African Republic, the Congo, Libya, Mali, Somalia, and South Sudan, among others, they\u2019re going through some very, very tough and very dangerous times. Terrorist groups, such as ISIS, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, and al Qaeda also threaten African peace. The United States is proud to work with you to eradicate terrorist safe havens, to cut off their finances, and to discredit their depraved ideology. And a number of you have told me -- actually, last night -- that we\u2019ve been doing a very good job over the last six or seven months in particular. \n \n We're closely monitoring and deeply disturbed by the ongoing violence in South Sudan and in the Congo. Millions of lives are at risk, and we continue to provide humanitarian assistance. But real results in halting this catastrophe will require an African-led peace process and a sincere -- really sincere commitment of all parties involved. And I know you\u2019re working on that, and you\u2019re working on that very hard. To assist in these efforts, I'm sending Ambassador Nikki Haley to Africa to discuss avenues of conflict and resolution and, most importantly, prevention. \n \n I want to discuss our partnership against a global challenge. Today, the world faces an enormous security threat from North Korean regime. We must all stand together and be accountable in implementing United Nations sanctions and resolutions in response to North Korea\u2019s hostile and menacing actions. \n \n We believe that a free, independent, and democratic nation, in all cases, is the best vehicle for human happiness and success. Thank you for joining me for this critical discussion of the challenges and the opportunities facing our nations. \n \n Africa, I have to say, is a continent of tremendous, tremendous potential. The outlook is bright. I look forward to hearing from you and your advice during the meal. I thought rather than just eating, we\u2019ll have long discussions -- and I look forward to that very much. But I also look forward to getting to know so many of you, and so many of you I do know. And it\u2019s an honor. It\u2019s an honor. \n \n And I really want to congratulate you -- growing very fast economically and in every other way. You\u2019ve done a terrific job, you\u2019ve had some tremendous obstacles placed in your path, but you have done, really, an absolutely incredible job. \n \n So I want to thank you, and I look forward to our discussion. Thank you. \n \n Thank you all very much. (Applause.) \n \n END 1:36 P.M.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The nation that seems to be showing up in most headlines Thursday is Nambia, mainly because it doesn't actually exist. In a speech to African leaders Wednesday, President Trump referred to \"Nambia\" not once but twice, first in his general introduction and then later when he mentioned that \"Nambia's health system is increasingly self-sufficient.\" As the BBC notes, that led to plenty of online jokes, along with people wondering whether he meant Gambia, Zambia, or Namibia. Turns out, it was the last of those. Coverage: For the record: The official White House transcript of the speech made the correction without mention of the mispronunciation. (You can hear for yourself in this video.) But that hasn't slowed a barrage of coverage making light of the president's mistake. One example: At CNN, Anderson Cooper referred to Nambia as a \"magical land far, far away\" in his recap. Namibia 101: The gaffe has led to a slew of civics-type primers about Namibia. Time, for instance, notes the tiny nation of fewer than 2.5 million people is relatively young, having achieved its independence in 1990.

Silver lining: \"If Trump's blunder was worth anything, it was this: The world now knows about Namibia,\" writes Luis Gomez at the San Diego Union-Tribune. He notes that Namibia also is one of the top global producers of uranium. The main point: The gist of Trump's speech was to tout the region's economic potential (he said he has friends who go there \"trying to get rich\"), and a member of the African advocacy group ONE praised the intent. \"I know 'Nambia' will be the narrative that comes from those remarks, but POTUS is right on this: Africa has tremendous business potential,\" tweeted rep Ian Koski.

    "document": "Since 1951, the Miss World pageant has been featuring over 120 contestants competing for one title and a crown. \n \n Now, for the first time in 63 years, the organization's chairwoman Julia Morley has announced that Miss World will no longer feature a swimsuit round in their competition. \n \n \"The organization has decided to take itself out of the swimsuit world because it isn't the path they're trying to take,\" said Chris Wilmer, the national director of Miss World America/Miss United States organization. \"It's not just a beauty contest, it's 'beauty with a purpose'. There didn't seem to be a purpose to have the swimsuit.\" \n \n In recent years, Miss World has emphasized their \"beauty with a purpose\" round, where contestants carry out charity work and raise awareness to worthy causes. \n \n \"Miss World should be a spokesperson who can help a community,\" Wilmer told ABC News. \"She's more of an ambassador, not a beauty queen. It's more about the outreach and what a woman could do with a title like Miss World.\" \n \n As they try to steer clear of focusing on the physical appeal of their contestants, Miss World plans to feature a beachwear round in competitions, as opposed to bikinis. \"It'll be more of a fashion competition than a bikini show,\" Wilmer said. \n \n In addition to the swimsuit round, Miss World contestants have competed in challenge events like sports, dance, talent, top model gown, Beauty with a Purpose video, and several interviews. \n \n \"I salute the miss world organization for their efforts to try and modernize,\" Wilmer said. \"Pageantry is an age old industry and I think with Julia getting rid of swimsuit and making it more of a lifestyle competition sends a strong message and I applaud her for it.\" \n \n On Dec. 14, Rolene Strauss of South Africa was crowned the 64th Miss World winner in London. It marked the final event featuring contestants wearing bikinis. ||||| In 1951, 26 women dressed themselves in bikinis and floated down the River Thames on a barge\u0097at least one was wearing a suit made entirely of spotted mink. It was a publicity stunt fabricated by an enterprising man named Eric Morley, as an attempt to raise both money and morale following the devastation of World War II. When the press heard that the most beautiful women in the world had gathered in their swimwear\u0097something completely unheard of at that time in England\u0097they flocked to witness such an extravaganza and the Miss World competition was born. \n \n Last night, the 64th Miss World, Rolene Strauss of South Africa, was crowned winner. While she is undoubtedly beautiful, as are each of the 121 international representatives she competed against, the pageant\u0092s purpose is vastly different than it was during its inception 63 years ago. In addition to four optional competitions in talent, fashion runway, swimwear, and athletics, Strauss was judged on an in-depth interview, a service project dedicated to keeping girls in school, and her academic record. (To wit: the 22-year-old is a fourth-year medical student.) Miss Strauss will also hold a unique place in the history of the pageant: She will be the last winner to participate in a Miss World competition that includes a swimsuit competition. In a private meeting on Friday, Julia Morley, the chairwoman of Miss World (she assumed the role following the death of her husband in 2000), announced to the international directors that the bikini portion will be eliminated entirely beginning in 2015. \n \n \"I really don\u0092t want\u0097I don\u0092t need to see women just walking up and down in bikinis. It doesn't do anything for the woman. And it doesn\u0092t do anything for any of us,\" Mrs. Morley, 74, tells me as we watch a sing-off between Miss Malaysia and Miss Scotland during a dress rehearsal at the ICC Auditorium in the heart of London's Royal Docks. \"I don\u0092t care if someone has a bottom two inches bigger than someone else's. We are really not looking at her bottom. We are really listening to her speak.\" \n \n For contrast, The Miss Universe pageant, which is owned by Donald Trump and was founded the year after Miss World, places a strong emphasis on the swimsuit element of the pageant. And, unlike Miss World, it does not include an interview or a service element. According to Mrs. Morley, following the death of her husband, Mr. Trump phoned: \"So little lady,\" he asked. \"Are you ready to throw in the towel?\" It was then that she decided to take out a $5 million loan to keep the company afloat. \"They are not little girls,\" she says. \"This is what I want to get away from. This sort of 'cute' image. No offense to Mr. Trump.\" \n \n There is an established belief, especially from the feminist left, that beauty pageants are a superficial and patriarchal forum. Following the first wave of the feminist revolution in 1968\u0097when Bob Hope asked a swimsuit-clad pageant contestant to turn around so he could observe her from behind\u0097400 women protested outside the Miss America pageant holding signs with messages that read, 'Cattle parades are degrading to human beings,' and 'We are not beautiful, we are not ugly, we are angry.' The sentiment existed in Britain too, and from 1988 until 2011 (23 years), pageants were not broadcast on primetime television in the UK. For the last three years, however, the spectacles have resurfaced as a cultural juggernaut: Yesterday's Miss World competition was hosted by E! and was reportedly watched by over one billion viewers worldwide. Instead of throngs of protestors, the event was attended by a well-dressed and worldly crowd proudly waving their national flags. \n \n \"We\u0092ve evolved so much. The real problem is trying to get Britain to understand they are 20 years behind when they think, 'Oh, bikinis. Oh, Miss World.' They never want to understand us because we are a good [agenda] item for their promotion,' Mrs. Morley says of a group she calls \"women's libbers.\" \n \n In 1951, the simple idea of putting a woman in a bikini on-stage shocked the world. And by the following year, two countries threatened to pull out of the pageant, citing immodesty. So the format changed: The swimsuit became a single segment of the competition, winners were crowned wearing a gown, and the interview portion of the event was introduced. In 1974, Mrs. Morley began Beauty with a Purpose, the service element of Miss World, which has helped to divert attention away from the external, physical side of the competition and raised over $1 billion for charity. In recent years, the bathing suit competition has been held prior to the finale, and judged privately by a modesty panel rather than during the live broadcast. Most women opt to wear one-piece suits or to wrap scarf around their waist. \"We don't want to just make them feel like they are walking bodies, you know?\" Mrs. Morley says. \n \n In an age where seeing women's bodies in states of undress\u0097on billboards, in commercials, in magazine ads\u0097has become common place, it's nearly more shocking not to display women\u0092s bodies on television than to reveal them.

Instead, he talked about stimulating trade by helping American small businesses sell their products to consumers in China and elsewhere in Asia. \n \n Alibaba held a big conference in Detroit last year to encourage American small businesses and farmers to sell their products to Chinese consumers through its platforms. The company didn't immediately respond to a request Thursday for information on how many US jobs those efforts have created so far. \n \n In the Xinhua interview, Ma said Alibaba \"will not stop promoting the healthy development of China-US trade.\" \n \n A strong advocate of globalization, he has expressed growing fears about the trade war, telling investors earlier this week that it could drag on for as long as 20 years. \n \n \"It's going to last long, it's going to be a mess,\" Ma said Tuesday in Hangzhou, the city where Alibaba is based. \n \n The 54-year-old tycoon, who set up Alibaba in his apartment nearly two decades ago, announced this month that he will step down as executive chairman of the company next year.

The Wall Street Journal also uses the word \"vague\" to describe how critics viewed Ma's pledge, observing that, nearly two years later, Alibaba hasn't released any figures related to the number of jobs created thus far. Count the Washington Post among those critics. It points out that based on Commerce Department figures, 1 million new American jobs would require that US exports to China rise by an additional $206 billion a year.

    "document": "Little Fockers COMEDY: United States, 2010 U.S. Release Date: 2010-12-22 Running Length: 1:35 MPAA Classification: PG-13 (Profanity, Sexual Content) Theatrical Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1 Cast: Robert De Niro, Ben Stiller, Owen Wilson, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Blythe Danner, Teri Polo, Jessica Alba, Laura Dern Director: Paul Weitz Screenplay: John Hamburg and Larry Stuckey Cinematography: Remi Adefarasin Music: Stephen Trask U.S. Distributor: Universal Pictures Subtitles: none \n \n Watching Little Fockers is a depressing experience. Rarely does a comedy bring such an overpowering sense of sadness. Admittedly, I laughed a few times and am willing to admit that the experience as a whole was more bearable than the trial of sitting through Meet the Fockers, but that doesn't alleviate my fundamental reaction: this is perhaps the most dispiriting motion picture of the holiday season. It's all about Robert De Niro. Once, in what seems to have been another lifetime, De Niro was considered by many to be the greatest living actor. That was before he started dabbling in comedy. It didn't take long for the novelty value to wear off. Now, like Leslie Nielsen, he has become impossible to take seriously. With this year's Stone, it appeared there might yet be hope for De Niro to return to acting. Little Fockers has shattered that hope. In many ways, it represents a new low for De Niro, a level of embarrassment to which I never thought I would see him sink. Watching his third outing as lunatic father Jack Byrnes, I embraced the reality that the De Niro of Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas is dead. All we have left is this bloated self-parody. Talk about a harsh dose of reality. (De Niro, it should be noted, is complicit in the immolation of his image - he's listed as a producer, as he was for Meet the Parents and Meet the Fockers.) \n \n Little Fockers continues the saga of Greg Focker (Ben Stiller); his wife, Pam (Teri Polo, reduced to a glorified cameo); and his father-in-law from hell, Jack (De Niro). Also returning for this installment are Pam's old flame, Kevin (Owen Wilson, less funny here than in James L. Brooks' How Do You Know); Jack's wife, Dina (Blythe Danner); and Greg's parents, Bernie (Dustin Hoffman, appearing in only a few scenes) and Roz (Barbra Streisand, with less screen time than Hoffman). New to the Focker universe is drug company representative Andi Garcia (Jessica Alba), who is hawking an erectile dysfunction drug called \"Sustengo.\" The (thin) storyline focuses on Jack's decision that Greg will become the \"Godfocker\" - the patriarch of the next generation of Byrnes and Fockers. In order for Greg to hold that title, however, Jack has to deem him worthy, and that requires spying and background checks. Some of the things Jack uncovers, like Greg's apparent dalliance with Andi, stoke his anger, and the simmering hostility between Jack and Greg explodes into all-out war. \n \n Director Paul Weitz, replacing Jay Roach, culls the most humor he can from the situations, but anyone expecting start-to-finish laughter will be disappointed. No matter what your taste in humor, whether it's low-brow bodily fluid material or somewhat more sophisticated jokes, there's something here to touch the funny bone - but don't expect too much of it. The person who chortles at De Niro's 5 1/2-hour erection probably isn't going to be as amused by the Jaws parody. The hit-and-miss comedy comes in service of an inane plot with zero character development. The real problem with Little Fockers is that most of the humor found in these circumstances was explored in the first movie, Meet the Parents, including the closeness of the name \"Focker\" to a profane word. Meet the Fockers re-hashed these things, and Little Fockers is going for the hat trick. The only new element is Jessica Alba but, aside from providing some eye candy (she has an underwear scene), she doesn't add more beyond a vacuous smile and a chirpy demeanor. \n \n There's not a lot to say about Little Fockers. It is what it is. It's comfort food for the masses - an unthreatening comedy with familiar faces doing pretty much the same things they have done in two previous excursions. Despite numerous sexual references and double entendres, it's not too graphic to be deemed unsuitable for older children and is at least occasionally amusing. There's no reason for this movie to exist except that its predecessors made a lot of money. By churning out this third installment, Universal is guaranteed at least a modest return on their investment (and perhaps better than that) and everyone involved stands to collect a nice check. It's a winning proposition for all except those increasingly rare movie-goers who crave a daring or original comedy that doesn't feel like a recycled sit-com. \n \n Discuss this topic in the ReelViews Forums. ||||| As I suffered through \"Little Fockers,\" wishing that I could have periodontal surgery instead and wondering exactly how I wound up a member of the bizarre cadre of human beings who watch movies like this because it's our job, I managed to identify a silver lining of sorts. I'm fairly sure that Robert De Niro views his role in this lamentable comic series, playing a Midwestern Irish-American ex-CIA agent named Jack Byrnes, as something of an acting exercise. Can this consummate New Yorker shed his accent, his inflections and expressions and body language and everything else that's encoded into his Italian-American DNA? He kind of can, and it's intermittently fun to watch De Niro, whose every impulse is to go outward and upward, as a guy who drives all emotion downward and inward. \n \n Yeah. OK. And maybe it's also a study in actorly technique when Jack has his son-in-law and long-running adversary, male nurse Gaylord \"Greg\" Focker (Ben Stiller), give him an injection in his fully erect whangdoodle? Or when Jack and Greg's dad, Bernie Focker (Dustin Hoffman), exchange fart and booger jokes around the extended-family Christmas-Chanukah table? Those things are of course the entire point of the Focker franchise, which weds its aging, high-prestige cast to a set of creaky, homophobic gross-out gags that would make many eighth-graders roll their eyes in embarrassment. Can we talk about something extraneous again now? Since female stars like Nicole Kidman get so much grief for what looks like botched cosmetic surgery, what's the deal with Ben Stiller's eyes? Greg and/or Gay (Gay Focker! Gay Focker! Just try to keep the Sierra Mist from coming up your nose!) looks mysteriously, er, youthful these days -- in a cadaverous, guyliner-y kind of way. \n \n Six years after Hoffman and Barbra Streisand joined the party in \"Meet the Fockers\" and a full decade after the original \"Meet the Parents\" (a mostly harmless exercise in paranoid family comedy, taken by itself) it seemed reasonable to believe there was no more Fockery goodness at the bottom of that well. Original director Jay Roach has had the good taste -- well, let's say the common decency -- to move on, but Universal Pictures has reassembled the entire gang under director Paul Weitz, which can only mean there's more mixed-audience holiday coin to be made here. So we get Streisand as Greg's mom, TV sex-chat host Roz Focker, making out with Owen Wilson, as the puppyish rich boy who hangs around waiting for a second chance with Greg's wife, Pam (Teri Polo). And Hoffman sweatily dancing flamenco. And Greg and Jack being mistaken for lovers by a New Agey school principal (Laura Dern) and then punching it out in a birthday-party ball pit after a misunderstanding that involves a hot Latina chick in sexy lingerie and Greg's miserable efforts to become the family's \"Godfocker.\" They kill me, these guys. No, seriously. If they make any more of these movies, they might as well kill me. Once more with feeling: Gay Focker! ||||| Is there a statute of limitations for how many good actors can be wasted in a bad movie? Antic and only fitfully amusing, \u201cLittle Fockers\u2019\u2019 is the multiplex equivalent of a cash grab \u2014 it\u2019s a three-quel, what did you expect? \u2014 but that only makes the quality of talent involved more than routinely depressing. \n \n Yes, there\u2019s Robert De Niro once more playing ex-CIA agent Jack Byrnes, paranoid ramrod father-in-law to male nurse Greg Focker (Ben Stiller). The ever-underutilized Blythe Danner is his wife again, and, as Greg\u2019s parents, Barbra Streisand and Dustin Hoffman dash through at the beginning and end, spritzing happily because they\u2019re not on the hook for the entire film. Hoffman, who spends his first scene learning to flamenco in Seville, looks fit, tan, rested, and ready. Unfortunately, he\u2019s ready for a different movie. \n \n Teri Polo returns as Greg\u2019s wife, Pam, and Owen Wilson as her ex-boyfriend Kevin, the latter mellow and perfect and weirdly neurotic. New players include Jessica Alba, as a pharmaceutical rep with the hots for Greg, and Laura Dern, as the mealy-mouthed principal of a private kindergarten. Sadly, director Paul Weitz (\u201cAmerican Pie,\u2019\u2019 \u201cAbout a Boy\u2019\u2019) and writers John Hamburg and Larry Stuckey have no idea what to do with either actress. Alba overacts frenetically \u2014 it\u2019s like she has to pee really badly in every one of her scenes \u2014 and Dern\u2019s plotline just disappears midway through. Too bad; her character\u2019s administrative K-12 doubletalk (\u201cNo two early humans are alike\u2019\u2019) is the funniest part of the movie. \n \n Otherwise, the humor goes below the belt early and often. \u201cLittle Fockers\u2019\u2019 features an extended enema gag and a box of musical condoms \u2014 and that\u2019s just the first five minutes. Much is made of an erectile dysfunction medicine called \u201cSustengo,\u2019\u2019 and the movie\u2019s comic high/low point comes when Greg has to inject his father-in-law in the privates with an Epi-Pen. Try explaining that to the kids. \n \n That\u2019s one of the few scenes that goes so far into bad taste as to be genuinely uproarious; otherwise, the jokes get halfway there and wimp out with a crude little splat. The original \u201cMeet the Parents\u2019\u2019 was a comedy of emasculation that didn\u2019t match its obvious model, \u201cThere\u2019s Something About Mary,\u2019\u2019 but that came close enough for the studio bean-counters. True to its title, \u201cLittle Fockers\u2019\u2019 feels like the movie\u2019s hyperactive grandkid, picking up and putting down various plotlines until you want to send it off for a long nap. \n \n For moviegoers who were around in the 1970s, here\u2019s the saddest part: Harvey Keitel shows up in the small role of Greg\u2019s house contractor and gets a one-scene face-off with De Niro\u2019s Jack. The two men circle each other for a few seconds, like pitbulls descended from Brando, and then it\u2019s over before it begins. \u201cLittle Fockers\u2019\u2019 is the sixth movie the actors have appeared in together and it\u2019s easily the laziest and least; what started with \u201cMean Streets\u2019\u2019 and \u201cTaxi Driver\u2019\u2019 has come down to . . . this. They should have just brought in Pacino and called it \u201cMother Fockers.\u2019\u2019 Note to the producers: I\u2019m kidding. \n \n Ty Burr can be reached at tburr@globe.com.

    "document": "1 of 6. Greece's Prime Minister George Papandreou holds an emergency cabinet meeting at the parliament in Athens November 8, 2011. \n \n (Reuters) - A deal on forming a Greek national unity government collapsed as the country headed toward an economic abyss and revived early Thursday the chances of former European Central Bank vice president Lucas Papademos heading the coalition. \n \n Prime Minister George Papandreou said he was handing over to a coalition that does not exist and then failed to install an old-style politician and personal ally as premier. \n \n On a day that was bizarre and chaotic even by Greek political standards, Papandreou wished his successor well and headed off to meet the president -- only for it to emerge that there was no successor due to feuding in the political parties. \n \n Papademos, whose candidacy had seemed doomed, insisted that both the socialist and conservative parties sign written undertakings to support Greece's 130 billion euro ($176 billion) bailout, as demanded by the European Union, a government source said. \n \n The outgoing prime minister had agreed to the terms laid down by Papademos, who as Bank of Greece governor oversaw the country's adoption of the euro in 2002, the source added. \n \n Papademos made his demands for both major parties to back the bailout package, which includes austerity measures that are likely to prove highly unpopular, amid warnings that Europe is running out of patience with Greece and may cut a financial lifeline that the party leaders seem to take for granted. \n \n Stefanos Manos, a former finance minister, said the behavior of Papandreou and conservative leader Antonis Samaras was undermining Greece's future in the euro and risking a possible return to the national currency. \n \n \"The Europeans are sick of us. Papandreou and Samaras don't realize they will stop giving us money and we will return to the drachma,\" said Manos. \"They are going to destroy us. These problems demand decision-making. They can't decide on anything and they are fighting like cat and dog.\" \n \n Greeks and the nation's international lenders have watched in growing horror for three days as party leaders feuded over a shrinking list of credible candidates to lead the national unity coalition after Papandreou's government imploded. \n \n Greece will run out of money next month unless the new government agrees emergency funding with the European Union and International Monetary Fund, Greece's last remaining lenders. \n \n LAST MINUTE SNAGS \n \n Earlier, party sources said senior members of the socialist and conservative camps had settled on the speaker of parliament, veteran socialist Filippos Petsalnikos, as the new prime minister -- barring last-minute snags. \n \n Papandreou then gave an emotional television address, supposed to be his last to the nation as premier, saying this deal had saved country's membership of the euro zone. \n \n \"I am proud that, despite the difficulties, we avoided bankruptcy and ensured the country stayed on its feet,\" he said. \"I want to wish the new prime minister success, I will support the new effort with all my strength. \n \n \"Today, despite our differences -- political and social differences do exist -- we have put aside our fruitless conflict and disagreement,\" Papandreou said. \n \n Papandreou and Samaras then began talks with President Karolos Papoulias on the new coalition. However, before leaders of smaller parties could join them to seal the coalition, the meeting was abruptly halted. \n \n But snags had indeed emerged, with large sections of Papandreou's PASOK party and the conservative New Democracy refusing to back Petsalnikos. \n \n Party sources said some lawmakers saw him as a pawn of Papandreou. \"We wanted a strong a man who could handle all the economic issues,\" a socialist lawmaker said. \"This candidacy is so close to Papandreou's policies, it does not signal the change the Greek people wanted.\" \n \n The president's office said a meeting of party leaders would be held at 0800 GMT Thursday, although in the current chaotic atmosphere political talks are often delayed or fail to happen at all. \n \n One of the few things that the parties agreed was that early elections be held on February 19. However, the government sources said that Papademos had also stipulated that the coalition's life could extend beyond that date if necessary. \n \n The next government has much to do. As well as winning parliamentary approval for the bailout, it has to pass the 2012 budget and secure the latest 8 billion euro installment of Greece's original rescue that was pulled together last year, to avoid bankruptcy when big debt repayments come due in December. \n \n For its part, the European Union needs to put out the fire in Greece to prove to international financial markets that it can tackle another blaze in Italy, a far bigger economy also in economic and political crisis. \n \n Some lawmakers backed a return to the earlier plan, which had appeared stalled, of recruiting Papademos to give the new government the credibility that politicians lost long ago. \n \n \"The only solution is Papademos. If he accepts by tomorrow morning we will be able to form a strong government that will pull the country out of the crisis,\" socialist lawmaker Spyros Vougias told Reuters. \n \n Papandreou discussed a Papademos candidacy late Wednesday with Samaras, and urged the conservative leader to contact the former ECB policymaker, a government official said. \n \n GREEKS WANT EUROS -- IN CASH \n \n Bank of Greece governor George Provopoulos made a rare intervention in Greek politics Wednesday. \n \n \"The uncertainty is hurting the economy and the banking system,\" Provopoulos told Reuters. \"There must be a strong government that will work hard to ensure the country's future in the euro zone.\" \n \n Greeks have pulled their savings from banks over the past week because of the deepening political crisis and fear of an exit from the euro, banking sources said. [nL6E7M94KI] \n \n They withdrew as much as 5 billion euros -- nearly 3 percent of total deposits -- after Papandreou's shock call last week for a referendum on the euro zone bailout, said one banker, who declined to be named. \n \n \"Many people withdrew their money from banks Thursday and Friday and money couriers had a hard time supplying banks with cash to satisfy the emergency demand,\" said another banking source, who also requested anonymity. \n \n Papandreou provoked uproar with the plan, due to the likelihood voters would have rejected the package, pushing Greece into bankruptcy and casting doubt on its future in the euro. Under intense pressure from home and abroad, he backed down but was forced to make way for the unity coalition. \n \n Many wealthy Greeks moved their money into foreign banks last year as the crisis deepened. Now other people are demanding sometimes large amounts in euro banknotes, fearing that any bank savings might be converted into devalued new drachma if Greece is forced to revert to its national currency. \n \n \"We got to the point where customers ordered amounts of up to 600,000 to 700,000 euros in cash to take home -- unbelievable,\" the first banker said. \n \n (Additional reporting by Harry Papachristou, Lefteris Papdimas, George Georgiopoulos; and Angeliki Koutantou; Writing by David Stamp; Editing by Jon Hemming) ||||| The Italian government presented economic overhaul measures to the Senate Budget Committee Wednesday, confirming its plans to raise the pension age and giving more details on how it intends to privatize state-owned real estate. \n \n The retirement age will be raised to 67 by 2026, according to the document outlining the government\u2019s amendments to the 2012 budget bill. \n \n The government is attaching economic overhaul measures to the annual fiscal policy legislation in a bid to hasten its approval at a time when investors are frustrated with Italy\u2019s perceived reform inertia. Yields on Italian Treasury bills rose to 7.15% Wednesday. \n \n Italy also plans to sell public real estate and the Economy Ministry will help set up special-purpose vehicles to buy them, according to the document, which was obtained by Dow Jones Newswires. Stakes in the vehicles can be sold to third-party investors. \n \n The government plans to set up the first such fund by the end of April 2012, to buy at least 20% of the country\u2019s unused prisons and army barracks, the document said. Future sales will include farmland and other properties. \n \n All net proceeds from such asset sales will go to reducing Italy\u2019s public debt, which at 1.9 trillion euros is almost 120% of Italian gross domestic product. \n \n The government will also order local administrations\u2013regions, provinces and municipalities\u2013to reduce their debt levels as of 2013, \u201cto protect the economic unity\u201d of the country, the document said. \n \n It will also allow companies that manage local public services to bid to do the same in other jurisdictions, a plan that aims to give the companies greater scale and squeeze out inefficiencies. \n \n The budget would also loosen rules limiting transfers of public-sector employees, slapping hiring freezes on administrations that have too many functionaries. \n \n Tax cuts will be offered to infrastructure investments, especially in the highway sector. \n \n In terms of labor regulations, the government plans to offer payroll tax credits to employers who take on apprenticeships as of 2012, and boost the ease of use of part-time contracts and women\u2019s participation in the work force. \n \n In a bid to boost activity in Italy\u2019s guild-ridden professional services, the budget would also abolish required professional tariffs for lawyers, notaries, architects and others, allowing prices to be set between client and provider.",

    "document": "Just as George Zimmerman\u0092s attorney pushes the envelope of accepted legal practices by launching a social media operation for his client, another site has popped up that belonged to the controversial former neighborhood watch volunteer who now faces a murder charge. \n \n This one is a 7-year old Myspace page called \u0093only to be king again\u0094 that makes disparaging comments about Mexicans. The Web page, which his attorney confirmed Tuesday is legitimate, makes reference to 2005 criminal cases and a brush in court with a woman who Zimmerman called his \u0093ex-hoe.\u0094 \n \n There are several photos of Zimmerman on the page, and in one of them he appears to be wearing the same orange polo shirt that he donned in his 2005 police mug shot. Zimmerman used the name \u0093Joe G.\u0094 on the site, and posted a biography that mentions he grew up in Manassas, Va., had recently opened an insurance business and missed all his friends. \n \n Last month, a Zimmerman Myspace page under the username \u0093datniggytb\u0094 was taken down. \n \n The Joe G page includes a missive written in street slang. \n \n \u0093I dont miss driving around scared to hit mexicans walkin on the side of the street, soft ass wanna be thugs messin with peoples cars when they aint around (what are you provin, that you can dent a car when no ones watchin) dont make you a man in my book,\u0094 the 2005 Myspace page said. \u0093Workin 96 hours to get a decent pay check, gettin knifes pulled on you by every mexican you run into!\u0094 \n \n Another line suggested his friends went to jail and did not rat him out. \u0093They do a year and dont ever open thier [sic] mouth to get my ass pinched.\u0094 \n \n The pictures posted on the page including several with an ethnically diverse group of friends. The blog section boasts about having two felonies knocked down to misdemeanors and describes a court battle with an ex-girlfriend. Zimmerman faced two felonies in 2005 for obstructing justice and battery on a law enforcement officer, but the cases were reduced to misdemeanor simple battery, and he was left with no criminal conviction on his record. \n \n Zimmerman\u0092s attorney, Mark O\u0092Mara, confirmed the page was his client\u0092s, and that it was abandoned in 2005. \n \n The site was the latest discovery in an ongoing social media battle in the Zimmerman case. The Feb. 26 shooting of Miami Gardens teen Trayvon Martin received its first groundswell of attention on social media platforms, which were later used to portray the victim in a negative light. Now the defense is embracing Twitter, Facebook and a blog to provide forums for discussion \u0097 and to raise money. \n \n Trayvon Martin\u0092s family took to the Web to raise funds and to gather petitions to demand criminal charges against Zimmerman. His killer\u0092s lawyer uses the medium to raise funds, post articles and announcements, and dispel rumors. \n \n \u0093We are not surprised to discover that our decision is controversial,\u0094 O\u0092Mara posted on his site, gzlegalcase.com. \u0093Some have called it unethical, and some have called it brilliant; however, we believe much of the controversy is about the medium, not the message.\u0094 \n \n Last week, O\u0092Mara said he ordered his client to wipe his Internet presence clean. Zimmerman took down his website, a Twitter account and any other social media accounts. Any remaining, O\u0092Mara said, were fakes. \n \n But once the defense attorney realized how much money Zimmerman had raised on the Web, he quickly set up a more-polished website with a link to a professionally administered legal defense fund. O\u0092Mara said he had agreed to take the case for free, but reconsidered once he learned he could be paid using web donations. \n \n O\u0092Mara hired Shawn Vincent of Orlando\u0092s Digital Marketing Revolution to manage a Facebook page as well. Within hours of the page going up, hundreds of people had posted comments both for and against the defendant, and a few people with fake user names shared harsh opinions of Trayvon Martin\u0092s family. One commenter on O\u0092Mara\u0092s Facebook page said Trayvon\u0092s mother was \u0093mooching\u0094 off white people\u0092s money. \n \n Within 24 hours, the site was changed so that users must submit comments for review before they are posted. Insults were deleted. About 1,800 people have \u0093liked\u0094 the page so far. \n \n Jayne Navarre, a South Florida consultant who devises social media strategies for lawyers, said O\u0092Mara\u0092s use of social media will \u0093almost certainly\u0094 taint a jury pool and compromise Zimmerman\u0092s shot at a fair trial. She said O\u0092Mara also may be violating American Bar Association rules that prohibit a lawyer from helping third parties make prohibited extrajudicial comments. \n \n While use of social media has risen exponentially in the legal field, \u0093what we have not seen is a criminal-defense attorney host social media channels on behalf of their client,\u0094 Navarre said. \u0093I would not be surprised to learn that members of the Bar are shocked and even disgusted.\u0094 \n \n Under American Bar Association rules, a lawyer can speak publicly on a case as long as it does not prejudice a potential jury. The association is revamping its rules to address social media, she said. \n \n Lawyers usually use social media to advertise, educate, network or recruit employees, she said. Some lawyers and judges have been sanctioned for inappropriate use of social media. \n \n Until now, Navarre said, the most unusual case of a law firm using social media was in 2010, when the Massachusetts-based class action firm Sokolove Law Inc. launched the first known niche social networking site devoted to engaging potential and current class members in online discussions about the birth control pill YAZ. But the site was considered advertising and was deemed in compliance with ABA rules, she said. \n \n \u0093The tactic certainly was cutting edge, and I don\u0092t think the Bar saw any writing on the wall,\u0094 Navarre said. \u0093I find in my social media consulting practice that many lawyers are still dragging their feet for various reasons . . . Others find it unprofessional, period.\u0094 ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Somehow people have developed the notion that it only serves to help the super-rich. This could not be more wrong. Many states have laws in place that allow taking over and administrating the sale and disbursement of everything you own in cases where there is no will in place at the time of death. This can leave your estate in probate court for years and limit what your family receives. This article strives to show the importance of complete estate planning. \n \n What Is an Estate Plan? \n \n Estate plans are a set of legal documents that lay out a plan of action in how your material wealth and health will be handled if you become seriously ill, or die. These documents normally include a will, advance directive, and your choice of executors that will handle everything from making the hard medical decisions, distribution of any cash left behind to the individuals of your choice, and seeing that any material possessions end up in the hands of the people you have chosen and placed in the will. \n \n Lack of proper estate planning can end up pitting one relative against another, which will cause the process to get hung up in a probate court for years. Lack of estate planning has literally ripped entire families apart. This is especially true when estates are valued at large sums of money and assets. Nothing can cause more immediate strife in a family than financial arguments. It can cause feuds that will last for many years to come. \n \n Exercise Control with Your Estate \n \n Taking the time to sit down with a estate planning lawyer and carry out complete estate planning is your chance to exercise complete control over what happens with your money, and possessions while you are in sound condition to do so. It is an act of kindness that will make your passing less stressful for all involved. Every detail down to the funeral arrangements can already be planned and ready to put into action. \n \n Estate planning allows you to be very specific in the details of how personal items, money, stocks, bonds, cars, homes, paintings, jewelry, and anything of value is distributed. You can decide who would best manage your estate. You can feel confident that every decision going forth is set in stone long before you pass away. You can even have them interface with your personal injury lawyer. No one will be left struggling making the tough decisions. \n \n Continue reading The Importance of Estate Planning",

Though he was asked to say he was sorry, Philipps says that Franco was never punished for his alleged behavior. \n \n When speaking to The Hollywood Reporter about her upcoming memoir and E! late-night talk show, Busy Tonight, Philipps said she and Franco have since discussed what happened on set and that he apologized. \n \n \"It wasn't even outrageous. At the time, 19 and with my first professional acting job, I was under the impression that this was just the way things were,\" she said. \"James and I have talked about it over the years. At one point he apologized to me. I was always acutely aware of my expendability, and so I felt I needed to never complain, always show up on time and not be difficult. If someone else was being difficult, it was my job to be the easy one or figure out a way to soothe the situation.\" \n \n During a 2016 appearance on Watch What Happens Live, Philipps had told host Andy Cohen about her previous confrontation with Franco on the set of Freaks and Geeks. During her chat with Cohen, the actress brought up Franco allegedly shoving her to the ground. \n \n \"When we were 19, we were on Freaks and Geeks and we really, really disliked each other. It\u2019s well-documented,\" Philipps said. \"He, like, shoved me to the ground once. It was really brutal. But we\u2019re friends now and we really like each other now as adults.\" She added that though she and Franco \"really didn't get along,\" they had \"since made amends.\" \n \n The excerpt from Philipps' book comes nearly nine months after Franco was accused of sexual misconduct by more than five women. The star of HBO's The Deuce has denied the accusations, calling the accounts \"not accurate.\" \n \n Aside from the assault she allegedly suffered at the hands of Franco, Philipps revealed days ago that her book will also detail her experience being raped at 14 years old. The actress shared her story last week, hours after Christine Blasey Ford testified in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, whom Ford has accused of sexual assault. (Kavanaugh has denied Ford's allegations.) \n \n \"This is me at 14. The age I was raped. It's taken me 25 years to say those words. I wrote about it in my book. I finally told my parents and sister about it 4 months ago,\" Philipps wrote on Instagram, accompanied by what appears to be a school photo. \"Today is the day we are silent no more. All of us. I'm scared to post this. I can't imagine what Dr. Ford is feeling right now.\" \n \n THR has reached out to reps for Franco. \n \n This Will Only Hurt a Little is due in stores Oct. 16. \n \n Oct. 9, 7 a.m. Updated with Philipps' quotes to THR.",

    "document": "The Obama administration said Friday that two more states, Washington and Wisconsin, will be exempted from many requirements of the federal \"No Child Left Behind\" education law. \n \n The decision brings to 26 the number of states granted waivers as Congress remains at a stalemate regarding an overhaul to former President George W. Bush's signature accomplishment. With more than half of the states now free from many of the law's requirements, there are questions about the future of No Child Left Behind. \n \n The 10-year-old federal No Child Left Behind law requires all students to achieve proficient math and reading scores by 2014, a goal that many educators say is impossible. \n \n The Education Department began granting the waivers in February in exchange for promises from states to improve how they prepare and evaluate students. The executive action by Obama is part of an ongoing effort to act on his own when Congress is rebuffing him. \n \n The administration says the waivers are a temporary measure while Education Secretary Arne Duncan continues to work with Congress to rewrite the law, which is formally known as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \n \n \"A strong, bipartisan reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act remains the best path forward in education reform, but as 26 states have now demonstrated, our kids can't wait any longer for Congress to act,\" Duncan said in a statement released Friday. \n \n The 10-year-old federal No Child Left Behind law requires all students to achieve proficient math and reading scores by 2014, a goal that many educators say is impossible. \n \n Members of both parties agree the No Child Left Behind law is broken but have been unable to agree on how to fix it. While it has been praised for focusing on the performance of minorities, low-income students, English language learners and special education students, it has also led to a number of schools being labeled as \"failing.\" \n \n Critics also say the law has had the unintended effect of encouraging instructors to teach to the test and has led schools to narrow their curricula. \n \n Washington state schools chief Randy Dorn said the waiver will lift the requirement that all students pass both the state reading and math tests by 2014. It will also give Washington school districts more flexibility about how they spend some federal dollars. \n \n In return, Washington will need to show improvement in test scores for subgroups of students who have historically had lower scores than average, such as those who qualify for free- or reduced-price meals. \n \n In late May, Wisconsin officials said they were modifying some details of their waiver application and expected approval soon. \n \n The federal Education Department earlier wrote to officials in that state, saying Wisconsin had a number of commendable proposals, but they were too short on detail. \n \n Other waiver applications are still pending in 10 states and the District of Columbia. Six waivers were approved last month in Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, South Dakota, Utah and Virginia. \n \n In order to get a waiver, each state had to promise to show in other ways that its students and schools are improving, and they were required to more closely link teacher evaluations to student test scores, among other requirements. \n \n Washington's waiver application emphasized its embrace of new national education standards, the state's new teacher and principal evaluations, and its efforts to take a broader look at student achievement beyond reading and math by also testing for writing and science. \n \n The waiver agreement requires that by 2018, Washington cut in half achievement gaps between various ethnic and economic groups, when compared with 100 percent passage rates. For example, if one group had 74 percent passing reading in 2011, that group would need to have 87 percent passing by 2018. \n \n The agreement adds another requirement for Title I schools, which are high-poverty public schools that get extra money from the federal government to help students who are behind academically or at risk of falling behind. \n \n It requires the state education office to annually identify priority schools, which are the 5 percent lowest-achieving of Title I schools; focus schools, which are the lowest 10 percent of Title I schools; and reward schools, the highest performing Title I schools or those making the most progress in a given year. \n \n ____ \n \n Contact Donna Blankinship through Twitter at https://twitter.com/dgblankinship. ||||| In just five months, the Obama administration has freed schools in more than half the nation from central provisions of the No Child Left Behind education law, raising the question of whether the decade-old federal program has been essentially nullified. \n \n On Friday, the Department of Education plans to announce that it has granted waivers releasing two more states, Washington and Wisconsin, from some of the most onerous conditions of the signature Bush-era legislation. With this latest round, 26 states are now relieved from meeting the lofty \u2014 and controversial \u2014 goal of making all students proficient in reading and mathematics by 2014. Additional waivers are pending in 10 states and the District of Columbia. \n \n \u201cThe more waivers there are, the less there really is a law, right?\u201d said Andy Porter, dean of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Graduate School of Education. \n \n While No Child Left Behind has been praised for forcing schools to become more accountable for the education of poor and minority children, it has been derided for what some regard as an obsessive focus on test results, which has led to some notorious cheating scandals. Critics have also faulted the law\u2019s system of rating schools, which they say labeled so many of them low performing that it rendered the judgment meaningless. \n \n In exchange for the education waivers, schools and districts must promise to set new targets aimed at preparing students for colleges and careers. They must also tether evaluations of teachers and schools in part to student achievement on standardized tests. The use of tests to judge teacher effectiveness is a departure from No Child Left Behind, which used test scores to rate schools and districts. \n \n Congress has tried and failed repeatedly to reauthorize the education law over the past five years because Democrats and Republicans cannot agree on an appropriate role for the federal government in education. And so, in the heat of an election year, the Obama administration has maneuvered around Congress, using the waivers to advance its own education agenda. \n \n The waivers appear to follow an increasingly deliberate pattern by the administration to circumvent lawmakers, as it did last month when it granted hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants a reprieve from deportation. The administration has also unveiled policies to prevent drug shortages, raise fuel economy standards and cut refinancing fees for federally insured mortgages. \n \n Critics question whether the waivers have done much to genuinely shift the focus of federal education reform, given their continued reliance on standardized tests. The waivers \u201cshould probably make the meh list,\u201d said Joshua Starr, superintendent of the Montgomery County schools in Maryland, which was granted a waiver in May. \n \n Mr. Starr said he believed that education reform should focus on incentives to help teachers collaborate and help students learn skills that could not simply be measured by tests. \n \n \u201cIt is another example to me of how we\u2019re not focused on the right things in the American education conversation today,\u201d Mr. Starr said. \u201cI have a lot of respect for Arne Duncan,\u201d he added, referring to the secretary of education, \u201cbut it\u2019s just sort of moving around the chairs on the Titanic.\u201d \n \n Mr. Duncan, in a telephone interview on Thursday, said states that had received waivers, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, would also use a mix of other indicators to evaluate teachers and schools, like how many students actually enrolled in college or took Advanced Placement exams, as well as reviews of teachers by their peers, their students and their principals. \n \n \u201cYou have to look at multiple indicators and multiple measures,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s been historically a push to way oversimplify what is very complex.\u201d \n \n House Republicans have repeatedly protested the Obama administration\u2019s use of waivers as an end-run around Congress. \n \n In a speech to the American Enterprise Institute this year, Representative John Kline, a Minnesota Republican and the chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Work Force, accused the administration of using waivers \u201cin exchange for states adopting the policies he wants them to have.\u201d \n \n But education officials in the states that received waivers expressed relief from the pressure of the looming 2014 deadline. \n \n \u201cThere was a general feeling that there were these goals that no one was ever going to meet,\u201d said Kelli Gauthier, spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of Education. \u201cNow we have standards that are possible.\u201d \n \n Instead of labeling all struggling schools as failing, the waivers direct states to focus most attention on the bottom 5 percent of low-performing schools. \u201cWith the waiver we can focus on those schools that really need a lot of help,\u201d said June Atkinson, North Carolina\u2019s state superintendent of public schools.",

The exemptions come ahead of a 2014 deadline requiring all students to be proficient in math and reading. They also come close to making the hallmark of George W.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| The annual Shark Week television marathon puts many marine biologists and shark enthusiasts on edge. We love that it draws attention to sharks and that it sometimes includes some real science and conservation. We hate the way it's done: maximum menace and blood, a two-note soundtrack and, occasionally, a gross indifference to facts. \n \n The Discovery Channel, which bills itself as the \"#1 nonfiction media company\" opened this year's Shark Week with a fictional \"documentary\". Confused? Apparently, the producers were, too. They opened the documentary these words: \n \n None of the institutions or agencies that appear in the film are affiliated with it in any way, nor have approved its contents. Though certain events and characters in this film have been dramatized, sightings of \"'Submarine' continue to this day. Megalodon was a real shark. Legends of giant sharks persist all over the world. There is still a debate about what they may be. \n \n If that reads like drivel, it's because it is (though I suspect it's true that no one with any sense approved of this film). It's also true that megalodon existed, but the film's title, Megalodon: The Monster Shark Lives, doesn't exactly point out that the animal has been extinct for two million years. \n \n This was merely the latest example in Discovery's long trend of sensationalizing sharks and dumbing down science. Wil Wheaton put it well: \n \n Remember when #SharkWeek was about science and biology and learning? \u2014 Wil Wheaton (@wilw) August 5, 2013 \n \n Christie Wilcox, who has long made this point, cut Discovery down to size for \"peddling lies and faking stories for ratings\". SyFy at least peddles nonsense honestly with its recent hit Sharknado. \n \n Discovery's own bipolar programming illustrates why many feel ambivalent about Shark Week. A third of their primetime specials have Jaws in the title, an association that hasn't served sharks well. Others include the words \"alien\", \"voodoo\" and \"serial killer\", or feature awkward portmanteaus in the Sharknado style, such as \"Sharkpocalypse\". Marketing is one thing, but these tactics approach the ahistorical conspiracy mongering of shows like Ancient Aliens. \n \n For every conversation with an expert, there is an interview with Tara Reid or a shrimp fisherman named Blimp. For every program that actually explores how sharks live, socialize, and evolved, there's Top Five Eaten Alive and Shark Rebellion. Many of these programs pay lip service to conservation efforts, but we've yet to see anything like the 2009 documentary The Cove's brutal expos\u00e9 of dolphin fishing. Sharks do need help, and Discovery should use its clout to help them by telling the real stories. \n \n Shark attacks on people are extremely rare, yet they get plenty of screen time. Survivors' stories can be inspirational, but Discovery often plays them for fear, airing \"dramatic reenactments\" and using the same camera tricks that made Steven Spielberg's monster movie famous. This mimicry of horror tropes doesn't tell us anything about sharks except \u2013 wrongly \u2013 to fear them. \n \n What happened? Shark Week has been an institution for over 20 years, and it's undoubtedly helped raise awareness, dispel myths, and make people interested in sharks. Perhaps success went to the executives' heads; one insists about megalodon: \"The stories have been out there for years and with 95% of the ocean unexplored, who really knows?\"\" This is the talk of a very cynical man or a true believer in the lost tribe of the yeti. \n \n But this isn't Yeti Week, it's Shark Week, and Discovery needs to remember that. Shark Week needs more sharks. I don't mean more footage of great whites breaching, which, although spectacular, can only be repeated so many times. Sharks are too diverse and strange to limit to top 10 lists and slow motion HD. Show us the rest of cast. \n \n How about threshers tail-whipping sardines? Or angels lunging out of the mud, wobbegongs hiding in caves, and cookiecutters glowing. \n \n Porbeagles merit some air time, too. Warm-blooded and hyperactive, like their bigger, more famous relative the great white, the young sharks roll in kelp and chase each other around. If these were sea lions or dolphins, there'd be no question that the animals were at play. \n \n And great whites, who've gotten all the press, haven't had their full story told, either. They sometimes move in \"clans\", have splash fights, and seem to have complex social lives, despite their solitary hunting habits. They fear killer whales; after an orca dispatched a great white, the entire region's population of sharks vanished, including a tracked shark who dove 500m and then swam to Hawaii to escape. \n \n Discovery made its name as a champion for science, but it's been abandoning that mission for years. Shark Week was once a paean to marine biology. It's been reduced to a monster movie disguised as documentary. Wheaton has called for an apology, saying that the channel \"betrayed its audience\". He's right, and if Discovery wants Shark Week to remain beloved, it needs to right its ship. \n \n If it doesn't, Shark Week may not survive \u2013 at least not in any recognizable form. Sensation may sell in the short term, but it's going to keep irking viewers until only a few remain. Worse, it misrepresents sharks as mindless killers, rather than the important, diverse animals they are. Discovery owes its annual success and fans' loyalty to them.

    "document": "As U.S. Rep. Thad McCotter's short-lived presidential run fizzled last year, the Livonia Republican turned to another aspiration: writing a TV show. \n \n \"Bumper Sticker: Made On Motown\" starred McCotter hosting a crude variety show cast with characters bearing the nicknames of his congressional staffers, his brother and a drunk, perverted \"Black Santa.\" They take pot shots about McCotter's ill-fated bid for the White House while spewing banter about drinking, sex, race, flatulence, puking and women's anatomy. It features a cartoon intro and closing snippet with an Oldsmobile careening through Detroit and knocking over the city's landmarks. The double-finned car has a Michigan license plate reading: \"Made on MoTown.\" \n \n The News obtained a copy of the script from a former staffer who offered it as evidence of what the five-term congressman was pitching while in elected office and the tawdry humor unbecoming of a public official who had become disinterested in serving the 11th Congressional District. \n \n McCotter told The News the work was unfinished and was given to a reporter without his permission. He said the show was a \"cathartic\" creative outlet that helped him through the humiliation of the presidential campaign flop. \"Bumper Sticker\" brought to life a possibility of something that could be worse than his political failure \u2014 being trapped in a bad TV show that takes away \"any shard of dignity left,\" he told The Detroit News. \n \n McCotter maintains he didn't write the show on the taxpayers' time: \"Most of my writing is done in my garage \u2026 where I can smoke.\" He circulated the idea to at least one filmmaker and shared the script with some staffers, he said. \n \n Some congressional staffers included in his 42-minute pilot episode dated Oct. 17, 2011, were the same longtime employees who handled the collection of petition signatures that botched his chances of getting on the Aug. 7 primary ballot. The character named \"Wardo,\" the nickname others acknowledge is used for District Director Paul Seewald, dresses in a matador costume, gets drunk on a whisky-laced Slurpee and runs off stage after puking. \n \n \"Chowsers,\" the nickname for Deputy District Director Don Yowchuang, leers at women's body parts and snaps cell phone pictures of them, goes \"cougar hunting\" and repeats the line \"I'm Thai.\" \n \n Seewald and Yowchuang received substantial pay increases in the first quarter of this year \u2014 19 percent and 32 percent, respectively, compared with previous quarters, according to records from Legistorm. McCotter was bounced from the ballot when 87 percent of his collected signatures were deemed invalid. The Michigan attorney general's office is investigating. McCotter maintains he did nothing differently than in the past by trusting the same longtime staffers to handle the petitions and has welcomed the probe. \n \n Asked who would find the humor in the script funny, McCotter said he wasn't trying to reach a broader audience. He said the show was \"deliberately designed to be a train wreck\" to further assault the dignity of the central character \u2014 McCotter the host, who is already humiliated from the presidential run. \n \n \"The very fact that people wouldn't find that funny and the suffering of the protagonist of having to be involved in it was what was funny,\" McCotter said. \n \n \"It's really a one set piece,\" he said of the show, inspired by the 1977 show \"Fernwood Tonight,\" starring comedian Martin Mull. \"Because once he's humiliated, it's kind of it. How can you do that five nights a week?\" \n \n \"Bumper Sticker\" is not McCotter's first foray into media. He was a regular on Fox News' overnight Red Eye show, a commentator on Breitbart.com and a guest political insider on a Washington, D.C., local morning show. He also published a book in February 2011 called \"Seize Freedom! American Truths and Renewal in a Chaotic Age.\" But it didn't gain any traction. \n \n But the creative musings he drummed up for a television pilot reveal a different side of the mind of the congressman. \n \n McCotter had been planning to leave Congress in 2014, he told The News, so he was preparing a career outside elected office and making connections with Hollywood conservatives. \n \n Other creative endeavors \n \n McCotter, who has played in a congressional band and cited rock lyrics in House floor speeches, formalized his pursuit of creative endeavors in 2010 when he started a registered corporation with the state of Michigan, Screaming Lemur Productions. McCotter said forming the company was necessary so he could join the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers and register a piece he and Jon Kahn, a musician and screenwriter, had done for Andrew Breitbart, the late conservative commentator and publisher. \n \n Screaming Lemurs is the name of the band he plays in with his brother, Dennis, a school teacher in Livonia. According to former congressional staffers, McCotter was also pitching a script for a movie with the working title, \"Think Dink,\" starring a character played by his brother, Dinky McSweeny, running for a Senate seat. \n \n McCotter says he first wrote the idea in novel form when he was a Wayne County commissioner before being elected to Congress, inspired by the idea of what would happen if a political candidate said whatever he wanted. Asked if he had pitched the movie idea to Kahn, McCotter said they discussed if anybody was ever interested, he'd have to give away rights to the work and someone else could write it while he was in Congress. \n \n Reached by e-mail, Kahn says he \"dig(s) McCotter \u2026 creative guy.\" He wasn't available for a phone interview. \n \n Local Republicans have castigated McCotter for fouling up the most basic political task of getting on the ballot, and critics say he has been disengaged from his job of serving his constituents in Wayne and Oakland counties. \n \n McCotter rejects the notion his writing hindered his job performance. Some politicians play golf, but creating things \u2014 writing, music, painting \u2014 is his outlet to deal with the \"destructive\" environment in Washington. \n \n A train wreck of a show \n \n In \"Bumper Sticker,\" conservative commentator S.E. Cupp is cast as guest on the pilot. Cupp, a regular guest on cable political shows, also has appeared on \"Red Eye\" and co-hosts MSNBC's \"The Cycle.\" \n \n McCotter tries to ask serious questions of the columnist, while his sidekicks chime in by asking how she \"keeps that great stripper bod?\" and whether \"D-Cupp\" is dating anyone. In the script, Cupp is disgusted by the \"train wreck\" of the show. \n \n It's unclear whether Cupp knew of her role in the pilot. Reached by e-mail, she didn't want to talk about McCotter. \n \n McCotter also casts Stephen K. Bannon, the conservative filmmaker, as the reluctant producer of \"Bumper Sticker.\" In the show, Bannon is not amused McCotter doesn't have a second guest lined up and McCotter has to interview Bannon instead. \n \n Reached by phone, Bannon, who now runs Breitbart's media enterprise, said he didn't realize McCotter cast him in the script. He recalls McCotter emailing him an earlier version, but he chalked it up to \"musings\" McCotter would send periodically to Breitbart and himself after his presidential run failed. \n \n As a filmmaker who reads plenty of professional work, Bannon said he didn't take McCotter's scripts seriously, but rather as cathartic musings to burn off the anger and hurt from his book and presidential campaign flopping. \n \n Presidential run not a lark \n \n McCotter, he said, is a serious man with serious policy ideas in a town \u2014 Washington D.C. \u2014 filled with unserious people. Bannon said he and Breitbart told McCotter they didn't think a presidential run was a good idea. While some may have thought McCotter's run was a lark, to him it \"wasn't a lark at all. He made a very serious attempt,\" Bannon said. When he was shut out of debates and not embraced by conservatives, McCotter took it as a rejection of his ideas that were worthy to be part of the national debate. \n \n \"I think he took that a lot harder than what people think,\" Bannon said. \n \n \"Thaddeus McCotter was a serious voice and I hope he remains a serious voice somehow,\" said Bannon, who calls McCotter one of the smartest people on Capitol Hill. \n \n Any future in hosting a variety show? \"God, no,\" he says. \n \n mschultz@detnews.com \n \n (313) 222-2310 ||||| Rep. Thaddeus McCotter failed to gin up much interest in his short-lived presidential campaign. Then the Republican failed to get on the ballot in Michigan so he had to drop his bid for re-election to Congress. \n \n His political career flailing, McCotter now hopes to succeed in the arts. He has written a TV pilot, according to The Detroit News. \n \n Mayberry it isn't, according to the News, which describes McCotter's creative endeavor as chock full of \"banter about drinking, sex, race, flatulence, puking and women's anatomy.\" \n \n If any congressman is qualified to make the jump from politics to screenwriting, it might be McCotter, 46, who is one of the quirkiest lawmakers in Washington. He's the lead guitarist in a congressional rock band. He makes campaign videos brimming with cringe-worthy fruit puns. And he quotes John Lennon in House floor speeches. \n \n To his friends, at least, McCotter's latest foray into coarse screenwriting is \"no surprise.\" \n \n \"Whatever Thad chooses to do will be outside the norm,\" said former Rep. Kenny Hulshof, who plays drums with McCotter in their bipartisan band, The Second Amendments. \"Everybody has a unique personality and Thad's is especially unique. \n \n \"There's very little that Thaddeus could do that would surprise me,\" Hulshof, a Missouri Republican, said, noting that \"if any retiring member [of Congress] could make it [in Hollywood] Thaddeus could.\" \n \n McCotter did not return ABC News' request for comment. \n \n His script for the 42-minute pilot episode of \"Bumper Sticker: Made On Motown\" was leaked to the Detroit News by a disgruntled former member of McCotter's congressional staff. The episode stars McCotter as the host of an off-color fictional talk show in which he banters with an array of characters based off his congressional staffers and his brother. \n \n The guests lewdly chide McCotter for his failed presidential bid and for botching a petition drive to qualify for re-election. McCotter, who will vacate his House seat at the end of his term, told the Detroit News that creating the show was \"cathartic\" because it proved there were worse things in life than his congressional and presidential failures, like being trapped in a bad TV show that takes away \"any shard of dignity left.\" \n \n Hulshof said McCotter was \"genuinely disappointed\" that his presidential bid fizzled nearly as soon as it started. McCotter never met the polling threshold of 1 percent support to appear in a national presidential debate. \n \n \"That was something I think he was hoping for or counting on not necessarily to propel him as a front-runner but to give his candidacy a little more legitimacy,\" Hulshof said. \n \n While Hulshof has not seen the script, he said, the show seemed fitting because McCotter's sense of humor has always been \"self-depreciating\" and \"outside the norm.\" \n \n \"In a matter of words, he can be humorous and rip you to shreds,\" Hulshof told ABC News. \n \n McCotter told the Detroit News that the show was \"deliberately designed to be a train wreck\" in order to further humiliate the main character, aka himself. \n \n \"The very fact that people wouldn't find that funny and the suffering of the protagonist of having to be involved in it was what was funny,\" McCotter said. \n \n The script is not McCotter's first foray into writing. He published a book, \"Seize Freedom!\" in 2011. And was \"fairly prolific on the song-writing front,\" Hulshof said. \n \n Whether it's writing rock 'n' roll songs or quixotic screenplays, Hulshof said, McCotter would likely be doing something \"nontraditional\" after he leaves Congress in January. \n \n \"I don't know where he goes,\" Hulshof said. \"Who knows, maybe he could be the new 'Sham Wow' guy. I don't know.\"",

    "document": "CAIRO\u2014Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak handed power to his vice president but retained his title, a half-measure that confused observers, angered opposition leaders and provoked an uproar from hundreds of thousands of protesters massed in the center of the country's capital. \n \n Charles Levinson has the latest from Cairo where protesters are reacting to President Mubarak's decision to remain in power. John Bussey and Robert Danin look at what's next for Egypt and U.S. relations with that country. \n \n Hosni Mubarak surprised many when he announced late today he would not step down as Egypt's President until elections in September. Tamer El-Ghobashy has reaction from Cairo's Tahrir Square. John Bussey and Jerry Seib have analysis of the situation. \n \n The move sets up another conflict with the opposition movement, which has called on supporters to gather for a huge protest Friday. Expectations that the president would resign had built through the day, and the immediate reaction to the speech was anger, with protesters chanting \"Leave, leave.\" \n \n An Army officer using a loudspeaker tried to calm protesters. \"Let's save our energy for tomorrow,\" a man screamed to the crowd. \"Go home and sleep, because tomorrow will be the day of judgment.\" \n \n The defiant tone taken by Mr. Mubarak\u2014and widespread confusion about the meaning of his speech\u2014left the Obama administration scrambling to devise its next steps in a crisis that appears out of its control. \n \n After Mr. Mubarak's speech, President Barack Obama, in a statement from the White House, said \"The Egyptian people have been told that there was a transition of authority, but it is not yet clear that this transition is immediate, meaningful or sufficient.\" \n \n Mr. Obama called on the Egyptian government \"to move swiftly to explain the changes that have been made.\" \n \n Mr. Mubarak's speech left the White House with a sense of \"disbelief,\" a U.S. official said. \n \n Egyptian officials said Mr. Mubarak gave the U.S. much of what Vice President Joe Biden requested earlier in the week: the delegation of presidential powers to the vice president, Omar Suleiman. \n \n But Mr. Suleiman, who delivered a televised address after Mr. Mubarak, enraged protesters by refusing to distance himself from the president, even as he gestured toward the legitimacy of the protesters' demands. \n \n The reaction casts a shadow over hopes by the U.S. and other traditional Egyptian allies that Mr. Suleiman would become a figure who is able to orchestrate a smooth transition from Mr. Mubarak to a more open electoral process in September. \n \n The White House is now squeezed between Arab and Israeli allies, who have complained loudly that Mr. Obama was pushing Mr. Mubarak too hard to step down, and lawmakers who accuse the White House of not pushing hard enough. Now, the White House finds itself largely a bystander. \n \n \"This is really bad,\" a senior U.S. official said after Mr. Mubarak's address. \"We need to push harder\u2014if not, the protests will get violent.\" \n \n Mr. Mubarak's language and refusal to yield to what he called the intervention of foreigners\u2014a reference that appeared directed primarily at the U.S.\u2014left protesters furious and the situation in Cairo precarious. \n \n The anger welling among protesters placed the country's army in a tight position in its quest to keep the nation stable and secure. \n \n Opposition leader Mohamed ElBaradei, after Mr. Mubarak's address, told CNN that the president and Mr. Suleiman were \"twins\" and that \"neither are acceptable to the people.\" \n \n In a earlier post on Twitter, Mr. ElBaradei wrote: \"Egypt will explode. Army must save the country now.\" \n \n Mr. Mubarak's speech continued a pattern of making concessions short of what protesters have been demanding. \"I've seen fit to delegate presidential powers to the vice president, as according to the constitution,\" Mr. Mubarak said in his speech. \n \n But he said he was \"adamant to continue to shoulder my responsibility to protect the constitution and safeguard the interests of the people.\" He vowed that he would remain in the country and said he was addressing the youth in Tahrir as \"the president of the republic.\" \n \n Israeli analysts remain concerned about possible new threats to the country's security amid unrest in Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East. Special correspondent Martin Himel reports from Tel Aviv. \n \n Egyptian Ambassador to the U.S. Sameh Shoukry told CNN that Mr. Mubarak had passed all powers of the presidency to Mr. Suleiman, except for three: to amend the constitution, dissolve parliament\u2014stacked with supporters of Mr. Mubarak\u2014and fire the cabinet. \n \n Those powers now belong to no one, Mr. Shoukry said, insisting that Mr. Suleiman was now the \"de facto\" president. \n \n That interpretation wasn't immediately clear from the speech, however, and its nuances appeared lost, or irrelevant, to opposition leaders and protesters waiting to hear the president say he was quitting. \n \n Instead, the president's comments brought a deflating end to a day of rumors and contradictions. \n \n Hossam Badrawy, secretary general of the ruling National Democratic Party, had said early in the day that he told Mr. Mubarak that the president needs to step down for the good of the country, and said he believed the president would go. \n \n Egypt's powerful military signaled it was moving to take control of the country. State television showed the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces meeting\u2014conspicuously without Mr. Mubarak present. \n \n The armed forces \"have started taking necessary measures to protect the nation and support the legitimate demands of the citizens,\" an army spokesman said on state television. \n \n The meeting and statement that followed appeared to represent a break from the military's previous posture as a neutral party providing security. \n \n Those developments drew what was possibly the biggest crowd yet to Tahrir Square, the epicenter of protests that began Jan. 25. \n \n Western officials, senior Egyptian government officials, and opposition leaders appeared to believe it was likely that Mr. Mubarak would announce he was stepping down and that the military would take over. \n \n WSJ's Tamer El-Ghobashy reports from the streets of Cairo on demonstrations expanded beyond Tahrir Square, and that government workers are striking in opposition to president Mubarak refusing to step down. \n \n Google Inc. executive and Egyptian protest leader Wael Ghonim said in his Twitter account: \"Revolution 2.0: Mission Accomplished.\" \n \n Question marks hang over what transpired inside the regime's corridors of power between early evening in Cairo, when signs pointed to Mr. Mubarak's stepping aside, and 10:50 p.m., when the president gave his televised address. A person familiar with Egypt's power centers said a possible wild card in Mr. Mubarak's decision could be the presidential Republican Guard, the opaque force that is responsible for the president's personal security. \n \n When Mr. Mubarak's face appeared on a makeshift television screen made from a large sheet in one corner of the square, the crowd suddenly hushed for what many thought would be a momentous event: the resignation of their president for 29 years. \n \n The crowd formed clusters, around people with radios and cellphones. People listened impatiently, and expressed frustration at the wordiness of his speech. As the end of the speech neared, a groan was audible in the masses. Some began chanting \"resign\" only to be told to shut up by those still listening. \n \n As it became increasing clear Mr. Mubarak wasn't resigning, many in the crowd began to hiss. \n \n \"I don't like what I'm hearing,\" said Mohamed Mustafa, 49 years old, huddling with four others around a small radio. \n \n Once it was over, people joined in a massive chant of, \"Resign means leave, obviously you don't understand!\" \n \n Soldiers who had abandoned their posts outside ran back to the edges of the square and eventually to their positions near tanks. \n \n \"This will make people go mad,\" said Sherif Oman, a 24-year-old engineer. \"He will regret this speech tomorrow. He is insulting us with this speech.\" \n \n After a period of spirited chanting, the stunned crowd made its slow exodus from Tahrir Square. Some protesters marched on the nearby state television building; most appeared to opt for home. \n \n Some protesters meanwhile began to chant, \"Tomorrow we go to the palace!\" \n \n \u2014Matt Bradley, Sam Dagher and Christopher Rhoads contributed to this article. \n \n Write to Margaret Coker at margaret.coker@wsj.com, Charles Levinson at charles.levinson@wsj.com and Jonathan Weisman at jonathan.weisman@wsj.com ||||| Mohamed ElBaradei, who has emerged as a leader of the opposition movement against President Hosni Mubarak, posted comments online within the last hour warning that the country has become volatile. \n \n \u201cEgypt will explode,\" ElBaradei, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and retired diplomat, posted on Twitter. \"Army must save the country now.\" \n \n In statements posted earlier in the day, ElBaradei vowed continued protests and complained of violence by Mubarak's government.",

Payroll taxes increase for many employers across USA NORFOLK, Va. \u0097 Last year was the worst Don Miller had seen in more than 20 years of running a graphic printing business here. Business slumped 15%, and he had to lay off two of the three workers who helped him print stickers and signs for Navy ships. Miller hopes to bring them back, but hiring will be more expensive for all Virginia business owners this year. The recession has emptied Virginia's unemployment insurance trust fund, and the state is making up for it by raising taxes on employers and cutting jobless benefits for seniors. In 2009, the average business owner paid $95 per employee. This year, the tax will be $171, according to estimates by the state workforce agency. \"It's another added expense to hiring somebody,\" Miller says. \"Everything's going up, and business is going down.\" Similar tax increases are hitting employers nationwide this year as states struggle to pay the 5.5 million Americans currently collecting state jobless benefits. So far, high unemployment and, in many cases, poor planning have prompted 25 states to borrow more than $25 billion from the federal government to keep benefit checks in the mail. In other states, unemployment compensation funds are still in the black, but reserves are rapidly dwindling. Nine more states likely will be borrowing by mid-year, according to a ProPublica analysis of state revenue and benefits. Tax on businesses Business owners in 36 states face tax increases ranging from a few dollars to nearly $1,000 per worker. Six states are scaling back or freezing benefits for the unemployed: \u2022 Jobless Pennsylvania workers will get 2.3% less in benefits starting this month, while the average tax this year for businesses will increase to $432 from $384 per worker. \u2022 Hawaii's employers face an average increase to $1,070 from $90 per worker. The state also proposes decreasing the maximum benefit by as much as a third \u2014 about $190 per week. \u2022 Texas, where the trust fund is $1.4 billion in the red, has increased the average tax on employers to about $165 from $89 per worker. Instead of fulfilling the unemployment insurance system's purpose of stimulating the economy, these measures may contribute to joblessness, says Gary Burtless, an economist who studies labor policy at the Brookings Institution, a think tank. \"We don't want to pick this moment of all moments to boost taxes on employers,\" Burtless says. \"We want to encourage employers as much as possible to add to their payrolls.\" Workers are being hurt in another way \u2014 through benefit cuts. In Roanoke, Va., James Hay, 70, received a letter from the state informing him that his monthly unemploymentbenefits are being cut to $100 from about $800 because state law limits payments to Social Security recipients when the state's fund runs low. \"I was devastated when I read it,\" Hay says. \"I thought, 'Lord, what am I going to buy heating oil with this winter?' \" Like many other seniors, Hay was working full time to supplement his $1,400 monthly Social Security check, which he says was not enough to support him, his granddaughter and her two young children. Then the asphalt factory laid him off. Unemployment insurance made up for some of the lost income, but now Hay is not sure how his family will get by. \"We'll just have to do whatever we can do,\" he says. \"I hope and pray we'll be all right.\" States borrow heavily The state hopes to save about $11 million through the cuts to seniors but anticipates borrowing $1.3 billion to replenish its unemployment fund before the recession ends. \"The middle of a recession is when people need help most,\" says Maurice Emsellem, policy co-director of the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers. Cutting unemployment benefits, he says, \"undermines the fundamental goals of the program \u2014 boosting the economy and keeping people out of poverty in an economic downturn.\" Many states such as Virginia are already at or near the highest payroll tax rates allowed by law, and others have pushed politically difficult tax increases through their legislatures, making further benefit cuts likely if high unemployment persists, says Rich Hobbie, executive director of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies. Some of the pain might have been avoidable. Long before the recession began, Virginia and many other states that have imposed tax increases or benefit cuts let their trust funds dwindle well below the 18 months of reserves the U.S. Labor Department recommends. Virginia had to slow down federal borrowing despite the impact on businesses and seniors, says Republican state Sen. John Watkins, chairman of the Virginia Commission for the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. \"I have angst for people who are unemployed,\" he says. \"But our trust fund is busted \u2014 it's gone.\" Pierce reports for ProPublica, an independent, non-profit newsroom based in New York.

    "document": "The View from the Front Seat of the Google Self-Driving Car, Chapter 2 \n \n Chris Urmson Blocked Unblock Follow Following Jul 16, 2015 \n \n Summer is one of the most dangerous times of the year on U.S. streets, as many of us spend more time behind the wheel, heading out for long road trips or local barbecues. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, for example, has declared the period between Memorial Day and Labor Day to be \u201cThe 100 Deadliest Days\u201d for teenage drivers \u2014 and they\u2019re not on the roads alone. Statistics like this keep my team and me working hard on a fully self-driving car that can get you from A to B safely, no matter how many beverages you have by the pool or how many texts you send to the new friend you met there. \n \n Our self-driving cars are being hit surprisingly often by other drivers who are distracted and not paying attention to the road. That\u2019s a big motivator for us. The most recent collision, during the evening rush hour on July 1, is a perfect example. One of our Lexus vehicles was driving autonomously towards an intersection in Mountain View, CA. The light was green, but traffic was backed up on the far side, so three cars, including ours, braked and came to a stop so as not to get stuck in the middle of the intersection. After we\u2019d stopped, a car slammed into the back of us at 17 mph \u2014 and it hadn\u2019t braked at all. \n \n As you can see from the video above, our braking was normal and natural, and the vehicle behind us had plenty of stopping distance \u2014 but it never decelerated. This certainly seems like the driver was distracted and not watching the road ahead. Thankfully, everyone in both vehicles was okay, except for a bit of minor whiplash, and a few scrapes on our bumper. The other vehicle wasn\u2019t so lucky; its entire front bumper fell off. \n \n Although we don\u2019t like getting hit, there\u2019s a silver lining here. We all want to know how self-driving cars are measuring up against their human counterparts, but the statistics we need to do this simply aren\u2019t ordinarily gathered. National crashes-per-miles-driven rates are currently calculated on police-reported crashes. Yet there are millions of fender benders every year that go unreported and uncounted \u2014 potentially as many as 55% of all crashes, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. (None of the accidents in which people hit us resulted in a police report \u2014 not even the July 1 crash, even though the police were on site.) Furthermore, the numbers that are available don\u2019t distinguish between miles-driven before causing a crash vs simply being involved in one. This all means no one knows the real crashes-per-miles-driven rates for typical American streets. \n \n But we\u2019re now driving enough \u2014 and getting hit enough \u2014 that we can start to make some assumptions about that real crashes-per-miles-driven rate; it\u2019s looking higher than we thought. (Our cars, with safety drivers aboard, are now self-driving about 10,000 miles per week, which is about what a typical American adult drives in a year.) It\u2019s particularly telling that we\u2019re getting hit more often now that the majority of our driving is on surface streets rather than freeways; this is exactly where you\u2019d expect a lot of minor, usually-unreported collisions to happen. Other drivers have hit us 14 times since the start of our project in 2009 (including 11 rear-enders), and not once has the self-driving car been the cause of the collision. Instead, the clear theme is human error and inattention. We\u2019ll take all this as a signal that we\u2019re starting to compare favorably with human drivers. \n \n Our self-driving cars can pay attention to hundreds of objects at once, 360 degrees in all directions, and they never get tired, irritable or distracted. People, on the other hand, \u201cdrive as if the world is a television show viewed on TiVo that can be paused in real time \u2014 one can duck out for a moment, grab a beer from the fridge, and come back to right where they left off without missing a beat\u201d \u2014 to quote Sheila Klauer of the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute in Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do. That\u2019s certainly consistent with what we\u2019re seeing. Please, as you get behind the wheel this summer, keep your eyes on the road. The fight to end distracted driving starts with each of us \u2014 at least until that day when you can summon a self-driving car and just kick back, relax, and enjoy the ride. \n \n You can find chapter 1 here. ||||| Chris Urmson, far right, shows off his project's self-driving pod to Google chairman Eric Schmidt and U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx. (Photo: Justin Sullivan, Getty Images) \n \n SAN FRANCISCO - Picture the sad sack who has a sign saying \"Kick me\" taped to his back. Google's self-driving cars can relate, only the sign seems to say \"Hit me.\" \n \n Just weeks after reporting to the California Department of Motor Vehicles that its gadget-packed Lexus SUVs had been hit twice in the rear bumper while waiting at stop lights in Mountain View, Calif., Google reported Thursday that on July 1 a motorist smashed into its stationary autonomous vehicle at 17 mph, resulting in minor whiplash to passengers in both cars and causing the offending car's front bumper to fall off. \n \n \"We're seeing first-hand the true measure of how distraction is impacting driving,\" Google self-driving car project director Chris Urmson tells USA TODAY. \"None of our accidents rise to the level of police reports. So what we are experiencing is what the road is really like.\" \n \n This marks the 14th time Google's fleet has been in an accident since the search company began trolling the streets of its headquarters in 2009. In every instance, other motorists have been at fault, Google says. These accidents may soon grow in number as Google recently began mapping the streets of Austin, Texas, and added its new pod-like two-person cars to Silicon Valley roads. \n \n To date, Google's autonomous vehicles have logged nearly 2 million miles, and add around 10,000 new miles of data each week. All of its cars are accompanied by law by safety drivers. \n \n The July 1 accident, which is the focus of Urmson's latest blog post and a video that shows a computer readout of the incident, would appear to be another example of humans making Google's point: That distracted driving in the age of smartphones and social media is a growing menace that might benefit from us turning much of that task over to robots. \n \n Skeptics, who include leaders of auto companies focused more on driver-assist technology, argue that fully autonomous cars come with regulatory, insurance and hacking liabilities. \n \n In his blog post, Urmson writes: \"Our self-driving cars are being hit surprisingly often by other drivers who are distracted and not paying attention to the road. That's a big motivator for us.\" \n \n Urmson goes on to say that according to the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration some 55% of minor accidents go unreported often despite police being on the scene. That was in fact the case for the July 1 crash, which was the result of Google's car stopping at an green-lit intersection - along with other motorists - because the traffic ahead was backed up. \n \n Writes Urmson: \"Our self-driving cars can pay attention to hundreds of objects at once, 360 degrees in all directions, and they never get tired, irritable or distracted. People, on the other hand, 'drive as if the world is a television show viewed on TiVo that can be paused in real time \u2013 one can duck out for a moment, grab a beer from the fridge, and come back to right where they left off without missing a beat,' to quote Sheila Klauer of the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute in Traffic: Why We Drive the Way We Do. That's certainly consistent with what we're seeing.\" \n \n Also Thursday, Google beat Wall Street earnings expectations and saw its stock shoot up 3.5% in after hours trading to $579. \n \n Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter: @marcodellacava \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1J3kaRi ||||| LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Google Inc. revealed Thursday that one of its self-driving car prototypes was involved in an injury accident for the first time. \n \n FILE - In this May 13, 2015, file photo, Google's self-driving Lexus car drives along street during a demonstration at Google campus in Mountain View, Calif. Google says that one of its self-driving cars... (Associated Press) \n \n In the collision, a Lexus SUV that the tech giant outfitted with sensors and cameras was rear-ended in Google's home city of Mountain View, where more than 20 prototypes have been self-maneuvering through traffic. \n \n The three Google employees on board complained of minor whiplash, were checked out at a hospital and cleared to go back to work following the July 1 collision, Google said. The driver of the other car also complained of neck and back pain. \n \n In California, a person must be behind the wheel of a self-driving car being tested on public roads to take control in an emergency. Google typically sends another employee in the front passenger seat to record details of the ride on a laptop. In this case, there was also a back seat passenger. \n \n Google has invested heavily as a pioneer of self-driving cars, technology it believes will be safer and more efficient than human drivers. \n \n This was the 14th accident in six years and about 1.9 million miles of testing, according to the company. Google has said that its cars have not caused any of the collisions \u2014 though in 2011 an employee who took a car to run an errand rear-ended another vehicle while the Google car was out of self-driving mode. \n \n In 11 of the 14, Google said its car was rear-ended. \n \n In a blog posted Thursday, the head of Google's self-driving car program, Chris Urmson, wrote that his SUVs \"are being hit surprisingly often\" by distracted drivers, perhaps people looking at their phones. \n \n \"The clear theme is human error and inattention,\" Urmson wrote. \"We'll take all this as a signal that we're starting to compare favorably with human drivers.\" \n \n In a telephone interview, Urmson said his team was exploring whether its cars could do something to alert distracted drivers before a collision. Honking would be one possibility, but Urmson said he worried that could start to annoy residents of Mountain View. \n \n According to an accident report that Google filed with the California Department of Motor Vehicles about the July 1 crash: \n \n Google's SUV was going about 15 mph in self-driving mode behind two other cars as the group approached an intersection with a green light. \n \n The first car slowed to a stop so as not to block the intersection \u2014 traffic on the far side was not moving. The Google car and the other car in front of it also stopped. \n \n Within about a second, a fourth vehicle rear-ended the Google car at about 17 mph. On-board sensors showed the other car did not brake. \n \n The driver of that car reported \"minor neck and back pain.\" The SUV's rear bumper was slightly damaged, while the vehicle that struck it lost its front bumper. \n \n Mountain View police responded, but did not file an accident report. \n \n ___ \n \n Contact Justin Pritchard at http://twitter.com/lalanewsman .",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It sounds as if Google is getting a bit fed up with the way distracted, flawed humans keep crashing into its self-driving cars. In the latest accident, which the AP reports is the first involving a Google car to cause human injury, a car rear-ended a stationary self-driving car at 17mph, causing minor whiplash to people in both vehicles. This is the 14th accident involving the self-driving cars, and Google says they have all been minor and all been the fault of the driver of the other vehicle. \"We're seeing first-hand the true measure of how distraction is impacting driving,\" self-driving car project chief Chris Urmson tells USA Today. In the accidents, which include 11 rear-enders, \"the clear theme is human error and inattention,\" Urmson writes in a Medium blog post. \"We'll take all this as a signal that we're starting to compare favorably with human drivers.\" Unlike humans, he notes, Google's cars \"can pay attention to hundreds of objects at once, 360 degrees in all directions, and they never get tired, irritable, or distracted.\" He tells the AP that Google is looking into ways to alert distracted drivers when a collision with a self-driving car is imminent, although they suspect self-honking cars won't go down too well with the public.",

The most recent collision, during the evening rush hour on July 1, is a perfect example. One of our Lexus vehicles was driving autonomously towards an intersection in Mountain View, Calif. The light was green, but traffic was backed up on the far side, so three cars, including ours, braked and came to a stop so as not to get stuck in the middle of the intersection. After we\u2019d stopped, a car slammed into the back of us at 17mph\u2014and it hadn\u2019t braked at all. This certainly seems like the driver was distraction and not watching the road ahead.\" See the video here.",

The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service reported last month that the number of woman-operated farms more than doubled between 1982 and 2007. Add primary and secondary operators, and there are nearly 1 million women in farming, accounting for 30 percent of U.S. farmers. \n \n So hot is ag life that novels about farming are replacing chick lit, offering an unexpected twist to the notion of dirty romance. \n \n Unlike the Farmettes and Women\u2019s Land Army that took over while men fought in World War II, women today see farming as both a mission and a passion. Some want to provide healthy food for the masses. Others are looking to build community or live a life of deeper meaning. \n \n \u201cWomen want to be outside, they want to be near family. There\u2019s lots of interest in where our food comes from, how it was grown,\u201d says Kathleen Merrigan, former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. \u201cWe are seeing more beginning farmers coming in and I think the trend is going to continue. Women are [already] outnumbering men in owning smaller farms.\u201d \n \n They arrive on farms \u2014 urban and rural, large and small \u2014 from two opposite worlds. Many are 40 and older, leaving behind office jobs and careers for the opportunity to get their hands dirty and create something tangible. At the other end of the spectrum are younger women who are coming out of agricultural and environmental science programs with a dedication to food justice, education, and reminding a nation led astray by fast food and TV dinners where its sustenance really comes from. There is also an older generation of women who have outlived their husbands and now own vast amounts of farm and ranchland. \n \n Combined, they are making new inroads for women who are determined to build a life around farming. \n \n Tammy Steele, director of the Oklahoma-based National Women In Agriculture Association, says female farmers have gained the respect not only of the USDA but also of the national farming community. That was missing, Steele explains, during the \u201960s back-to-the-land movement, when women were more concerned with breaking the glass ceiling in corporate America than they were in tilling the earth. \n \n What\u2019s more, female farmers have shattered the old stereotypes. St. Paul, Minn.\u2019s Der Thou grows flowers. Teresa Brockman of Eureka, Ill., grows 25 varieties of fruit on her Sunny Lane Farm. Debby Zygielbaum, in her 30s, raises sheep and grows organic grapes, olives, and fruits for Robert Sinskey Vineyards in Napa Valley, Calif. These women are a garden of variety. \n \n Women do face some unique challenges in this business. Since women\u2019s farms tend to be smaller, many need assistance with business plans and financing. Access to equipment can be limited. Many seek advice on marketing and how to get their goods to the public. As a result, we\u2019ve seen the emergence of organizations such as the National Women In Agriculture Association and the Women, Food and Agriculture Network, both of which are seeing their memberships soar, as well as other, less formal networks. \n \n Not everyone needs help, of course. Haylene Green, 68, farms alone on a single acre in Atlanta\u2019s tough West End, raising organic Caribbean vegetables, among them her famous \u201chuge fatty bum-bum\u201d tropical pumpkins. But others set up businesses with friends, sisters, brothers, same-sex partners, fathers, mothers. They\u2019ve created sisterhoods, networks for sharing livestock and tractors, seeds, labor, financial assistance, and know-how. \n \n Many of these networks are still unrecognized by the mainstream, but some are breaking into the open. Soil Sisters offers tours of organic farms in south-central Wisconsin as part of MOSES, the Midwest Organic Sustainable Education Service. The MOSES Rural Women\u2019s Project is led by 46-year-old Lisa Kivirist of Browntown, Wis., who with her husband left a career in advertising at Chicago\u2019s Leo Burnett 17 years ago to start the Inn Serendipity Farm and B&B. Annie\u2019s Project, which offers assistance with everything from risk management to business plans to marketing, has expanded nationally. \n \n It makes perfect sense, says Merrigan, the former USDA chief: \u201cWomen are agriculturalists globally. The U.S. is trying to catch up.\u201d \n \n What is most apparent, though, is how content these women are with their agrarian lives. \u201cWomen make the food choices, they make the choices on what to feed their family, so their movement into farming is very natural,\u201d says Temra Costa, author of Farmer Jane: Women Changing the Way We Eat and the force behind the website Farmer Jane. Costa lives outside of Oakland, Calif., where she homesteads with chickens and a small vegetable plot. \n \n Tammy Burnell, for her part, says she\u2019s known she wanted to be a farmer since she was 6 years old. Throughout the years she kept having a dream, even though she lived in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that she was growing vegetables in Georgia, near a pond. \u201cThen the flood came and we lost everything,\u201d Burnell says. What next? She typed \u201cGeorgia Organics\u201d into Google and up came an 85-acre farm for rent. \u201cSo we loaded our \u201957 red Chevy truck bearing a water ring from the flood and took off.\u201d \n \n Burnell uses a plot of the farm she rents to teach young women to farm. She calls them \u201cthe blooms.\u201d \u201cWhat do I love about farming? Teaching. And being able to say I want a fresh salad and walking 20 feet and picking lettuce or a sweet pea for me and a customer,\u201d Burnell says. \u201cLike all the women farming and wanting to farm, I know this: We all want to lift our hands and praise the food, trees, and birds, and scream on the top of our lungs how great it is. And no one hears, not a soul.\u201d ||||| In the four years I\u2019ve served as Deputy Secretary, I\u2019ve talked with thousands of women in agriculture \u2013 from young women thinking about entering farming to older women who have been tilling the soil for decades. Each of their stories is powerful on its own. But taken together, they have been an inspiration to the entire country. And today, we know that there are nearly one million of these stories around the country \u2013 nearly one million women farming and ranching on America\u2019s working lands. \n \n A study released today by USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service, Characteristics of Women Farm Operators and Their Farms found that the number of women-operated farms more than doubled between 1982 and 2007. When all women involved with farming are added up \u2013 including primary and secondary operators \u2013 they are nearly one million strong and account for 30% of U.S. farmers. \n \n The study also found that the number of women-operated farms increased in all sales classes, suggesting that size does not matter when it comes to agricultural opportunity for women. \n \n This puts real numbers to a trend that many of us have seen firsthand: there is serious momentum behind women in agriculture. This is personally gratifying for me \u2013 supporting women in agriculture has long been one of my passions. And it is a sign of the growing importance of USDA efforts to reach women farmers and ranchers. \n \n While at USDA, I\u2019ve made this a priority. For instance, in the last four years, USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency has made significant modifications to its County committee structure to ensure fair representation of minority and women producers. \n \n We are also highlighting the accomplishments of women in agriculture, even as we work to ensure that USDA programs serve them better. Through the Know Your Farmer, Know Your Food initiative, we\u2019ve seen how women are driving the development of local and regional food systems across the country. Last fall, I penned an op-ed with another women leader in agriculture, New Hampshire Agricultural Commissioner Lorraine Stuart Merrill, about the contributions women are making in the Granite State\u2019s economy through local food. \n \n The ERS study also finds that women are leaders in livestock production. Nearly half of our country\u2019s women-operated farms\u2014those for which a woman is primarily responsible for making the business decisions\u2014specialize in livestock. During a White House Google+ Hangout about women in agriculture, I talked with Cory Carman, a fourth-generation rancher from eastern Oregon who left farming for another career only to follow her heart back to Carman Ranch to raise cattle. Now she is the operator of a thriving direct-marketing beef business. \n \n For me, one of the most exciting findings of the ERS report is that younger women are entering farming faster than older women are leaving. Women also have a higher land ownership rate than their male counterparts, with 85% of women owning all of the land they farm, compared to 66% of their male counterparts. \n \n But women farmers and ranchers still have a ways to go. More women than men rely on off-farm income, suggesting that farming cannot support them full-time. Only 5% of women-operated farms have sales of $100,000 or more. \n \n Tonight, I will be traveling to LaCrosse, WI to join WomenShare 2013, an event focused on women in the food system. This will be my last official travel as Deputy Secretary of USDA. As I prepare to leave my post as the highest ranking woman at the Department, know that I will continue to work on advancing women\u2019s opportunities in agriculture. One million women is only the beginning.",

    "document": "It\u2019s been so many years since Debra Long has seen or talked to her son that she\u2019s not sure she would recognize him. \n \n Long keeps an old photo album with fading family pictures. There\u2019s one of Matt at 9. There\u2019s another taken shortly after his wedding. \n \n In her Centre County home is a framed picture of Matt from his prom. He\u2019s posed and smiling in front of a draped backdrop in a bow tie, leaning into his high school girlfriend. \n \n That relationship ended ugly, Long remembers. When they broke up in 2002, Matt was charged with harassing the woman and her new boyfriend, and later pleaded guilty. \n \n It came as no surprise to Long. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s how Jerry taught him to act,\u201d she said. \n \n Matt Sandusky is not part of the legal case against the former Penn State football coach and his adoptive father, Jerry Sandusky. But in many ways, Matt\u2019s story has become intertwined in the saga. \n \n It\u2019s a complicated story. \n \n Matt lived with the Sanduskys through many of the years that abuse is alleged to have happened under the roof of their modest two-story home. \n \n Within several hundred pages of evidence collected by investigators during a grand jury probe of Jerry Sandusky are several police reports about the 68-year-old\u2019s youngest adopted son. \n \n Well before Sandusky was accused of being a child molester, Matt\u2019s biological mother was the lone voice of concern when Sandusky took her son into foster care in 1996. Notes to her attorney show she challenged the court, made accusations of stalkinglike behavior against Sandusky and suspected abuse. \n \n And so Long became one of the first people investigators thought to interview after a teenage boy from Clinton County made allegations in 2009 that were the onset of a case that would lead to Jerry Sandusky\u2019s arrest and end the career of Penn State football coach Joe Paterno. Even the circumstances around his move into the Sandusky home have their own backstory. \n \n Jerry Sandusky was in Los Angeles preparing for the 1995 Rose Bowl game when he made calls back to Centre County and arranged for Matt to move to Sandusky\u2019s house directly from juvenile detention, where Matt was being held after his arrest for setting fire to a barn. \n \n Family and friends have said the relationship between Matt and Jerry Sandusky was controlling and rocky. \n \n Matt\u2019s biological brother, Ron Heichel, remembers being a teenager in the 1990s and trying to reach Matt at the Sandusky home. \n \n Sandusky\u2019s wife, Dottie, answered the phone. \n \n \u201cAnd she said, \u2018He\u2019s not your brother anymore.\u2019 This was before he was even adopted,\u201d he said. \n \n A source close to Jill Thomas, Matt\u2019s ex-wife and the mother of his three children, told The Patriot-News that Jill agreed to be interviewed by police as part of the Sandusky investigation. \n \n \n \n According to the source, she said Matt was estranged from Sandusky for a long time, and only talked to him a few times during their marriage. \n \n When Jerry Sandusky would call Matt, she told police, Matt would keep the conversations private. But every time he hung up the phone he would go to the bathroom and throw up. \n \n When contacted, Jill Thomas confirmed that she has been a part of this case and was even supposed to be a witness at a pre-trial hearing for Jerry Sandusky. She never took the stand. Instead, prosecutors summarized her concerns about Sandusky. \n \n After the hearing she told The Patriot-News that the statement the prosecutors gave the judge did not express all of her concerns, and she wasn\u2019t consulted before it was written. \n \n \n \n Saved documents \n \n Last spring, as the grand jury investigation was wrapping up nearly three years of testimony, Long was subpoenaed to testify about the relationship between Jerry Sandusky and her son. \n \n She told grand jurors she witnessed stalking behavior and suspected something was wrong based on a drastic change in her son\u2019s attitude. \n \n On a hunch, she says she asked Matt if Sandusky had touched him, and she said he simply answered, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u201d \n \n When contacted by phone, Matt said, \u201cI have nothing to say. I have no comment about anything.\u201d His attorney did not return messages. Jerry Sandusky\u2019s attorney, Joe Amendola, says he\u2019s not worried about Matt\u2019s testimony before the grand jury. \n \n Amendola said that Long has been bitter toward Sandusky since Matt\u2019s adoption and said that Matt\u2019s own testimony would discredit her. \n \n But Long saved the documents and her notes from court appearances in the 1990s, including a letter from a school-based probation officer, which suggests that Sandusky\u2019s home wasn\u2019t a good fit for Matt. She stands by her claims that Sandusky stole her son. \n \n A continuing theme in her notes: Sandusky is causing Matt to alienate himself from his biological family. \n \n Since Sandusky has been charged, her story has received national attention, and Long says the FBI has received the paperwork she kept from her court battle. The FBI is conducting an investigation parallel to the state\u2019s, and it appears to be more focused on a possible cover-up. \n \n \n \n Highs and lows \n \n Within several hundred pages of evidence collected by investigators during a grand jury probe of Jerry Sandusky are dozens of reports on Matt. \n \n Now 33, Matt once was Matt Heichel. He came from a poor, single-parent household in Centre County \u2014 a small home he shared with his mom, sister and brother. The children witnessed their mom in an abusive relationship, something later documented in a court case that would determine the fate of Matt\u2019s brother. \n \n So, maybe it made sense for Matt to go live with the former defensive coordinator and his wife, Dottie, as a foster child just days after he set fire to the barn. \n \n Long\u2019s parental rights were never terminated. It wasn\u2019t until Matt turned 18 and became a legal adult that he was formally adopted by Jerry and Dottie. \n \n But the relationship had some steep highs and lows. \n \n Police records \u2014 mentioned and requested from prosecutors in a motion filed by Amendola \u2014 show that a teenage Matt ran away in 1996. In 1994 the police were called to Sandusky\u2019s home to investigate a theft of cash and clothing that Matt had been accused of stealing. \n \n About four months after moving to the Sandusky home, Matt attempted suicide with a girl living at the Sandusky home. \n \n In 2003, after Matt married and moved out of the Sandusky home, the father-son relationship had become strained. \n \n On May 3, 2003, State College police were called to Matt\u2019s home for a trespassing complaint, according to a police source. Jerry Sandusky had been told he wasn\u2019t welcome there, but had come over anyway, the source said. Jerry Sandusky told an officer he was trying to get back a carpet cleaner, and after he was given the appliance, he left, according to the source. \n \n As soon as Sandusky was arrested in November, Thomas asked the court to bar Matt from taking her children to visit their grandfather. She later issued a statement saying her son was seeing a therapist because after her children told her Sandusky had \u201cinappropriately touched\u201d her young son. \n \n The therapist \u201ccould not rule out that Jerry Sandusky was grooming my son for sexual abuse,\u201d she wrote, and said she opposed any visitation allowed by the court. \n \n \u2018Abandonment issues\u2019 \n \n Matt had joined The Second Mile around age 7, along with his younger brother, Ron Heichel, a bigger and more rambunctious kid than shy and reserved Matt. \n \n One year and one week apart in age, the brothers were inseparable, Ron Heichel said. \n \n \u201cWe did everything together. Brother things,\u201d he said. \n \n And that included plenty of trouble. \n \n The day of the barn fire, Ron Heichel was suspended from school and went deer hunting. Otherwise, he\u2019d have been right alongside his brother, he said. \n \n When Matt was caught, he was sent to juvenile detention and never returned home. It was devastating to the family, Ron Heichel remembers. \n \n \u201cIt was a very trying time \u2014 losing your best friend in the world,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day he\u2019s here and one day he\u2019s not. That\u2019s one of my biggest issues in life, is abandonment issues. That is definitely a key moment in my life.\u201d \n \n Ron says he tried to stay connected to his brother, but never felt welcome in the Sandusky home. \n \n He\u2019d always felt that Jerry Sandusky favored Matt over him, and he remembers feeling incredibly jealous and hurt when Sandusky befriended his brother but seemed to want nothing to do with him. \n \n \u201cLooking back on it now, I\u2019d say I was more troubled than Matt was, but Jerry didn\u2019t see it that way,\u201d he said. \n \n \n \n Different paths \n \n There is no doubt their lives would take drastically different paths. \n \n After some time, Matt\u2019s grades began to rise, and he ended up attending Penn State, although he never graduated. \n \n He recently married for the second time and has three children. He has reunited with Sandusky and has a good relationship with Dottie. \n \n Ron Heichel calls the State Correctional Facility at Mahanoy his home. He was convicted last March of first-degree murder and is serving a life term, even though he maintains his innocence in the 2009 shooting death of a Centre Hall father of four and is appealing his conviction. \n \n In a strange way, the two cases collided. \n \n Early in the Centre Hall murder investigation, one trooper recognized Long from nearly 15 years ago as Matt\u2019s mom. That trooper was now assigned to Sandusky\u2019s investigation as well and wanted to talk about Matt. \n \n That\u2019s how Matt and Long ended up getting a subpoena to testify before the grand jury. \n \n Then, when Ron Heichel\u2019s murder case went to trial, there was another intersection. The judge assigned to the case was the same woman who had been the guardian for Matt when Matt was in foster care with the Sanduskys. By then she had been elected judge. \n \n \n \n Legal flexibility \n \n The Patriot-News asked two attorneys familiar with child protective services law to look at the documents Long kept about Matt\u2019s foster care placement. \n \n There are no glaring deviations from standard practices in the 1990s. But there are things that, in hindsight, catch attention. \n \n \u2022 Long had already been approved to be a foster parent for a nephew who was taken from his home, and after Matt left, she took care of three more. Why was she fit to take care of someone else\u2019s child but not her own? \n \n \u2022 In a letter from school-based probation officer, Terry Trude expressed concerns about Matt\u2019s placement with the Sandusky\u2019s, even though he acknowledged that Matt should remain in foster care. \n \n \u2022 And a letter in response to concerns made by Long indicates that not all procedures were followed in Matt\u2019s case. \n \n But the child welfare system is complicated. Creativity for the benefit of a child is encouraged. The criminal adult system is much more black and white. In juvenile court, there is a lot more flexibility. \n \n And documents are sealed. \n \n A spokesman for the Department of Public Welfare said there has been no internal investigation opened related to Sandusky since the scandal broke, and everyone began scrutinizing each minute of Sandusky\u2019s life. \n \n But before the allegations, Sandusky was a well trusted and respected member of the community, hailed as a guardian of children. His charity, The Second Mile, was a statewide and nationally recognized haven for troubled youths and had a relationship with the county Children and Youth Services for foster care placement. \n \n \u201cThis is not Joe who lives on Maple Avenue. This is \u2014 at a time when community based juvy placements are just getting off the ground \u2014 an organization that stands out because it is attached to Penn State and the notable Sandusky,\u201d said Frank Cervone, a Philadelphia lawyer and executive director of Support Center for Child Advocates. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s the narrative of these 15 years of Sandusky,\u201d Cervone said, referring to the grand jury presentment that identifies 10 alleged victims abused over a decade and a half. \n \n \u201cIs this an example of the clouded judgment created by the Penn State/Sandusky mentality? I imagine it probably is, but again, I\u2019m not reading this whole picture.\u201d \n \n That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to say if there\u2019s anything different about Matt\u2019s foster care placement. \n \n The fact that Long was able to care for other children, \u201cit could be entirely odd,\u201d Cervone said. \u201cIt could be entirely normal. We don\u2019t know what Matt\u2019s issues were. ... He wasn\u2019t removed from her care because of any behaviors or limitations of hers. He may have been placed because the court wanted him placed. It was almost 20 years ago, a very different world. I\u2019m betting the kid\u2019s acting out and not going to school and the court looks at it and says, \u2018We\u2019re going to put you someplace where we know you\u2019re going to go to school.\u2019 \u201d \n \n But Jason Kutulakis, a midstate attorney who has worked with Children and Youth Services for several years, called it \u201ccreepy\u201d and \u201cweird\u201d that Sandusky would make a phone call \u2014 as he describes in his book \u2014 and essentially say, \u2018Hey, I want to take that kid home.\u2019 \n \n \u201cI can tell you, from my perspective, he has no tools to counsel a delinquent kid who allegedly committed an arson,\u201d Kutulakis said. \u201cThat\u2019s a crime where they start bringing in experts right away.\u201d \n \n Juveniles who commit arson are typically sent to inpatient care for intensive psychological evaluations and not to private homes, according to Kutulakis and Cervone. \n \n \u201cBut keep in mind who you are dealing with,\u201d Kutulakis said. \u201cOne of the most prolific defensive coordinators in the country. If he had made one of those calls before, that might not have seemed unusual.\u201d \n \n What doesn\u2019t make sense, he said, is that because Sandusky had no formal psychological training, he had the same skill set as Matt\u2019s biological mom. \n \n So why couldn\u2019t he just go home? \n \n \u201cPresumably, she could afford and provide the same type of care he was providing, and that\u2019s what bizarre,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to me Matt should have gone into licensed care.\u201d \n \n About a year after Matt\u2019s case began, then-Gov. Tom Ridge overhauled child protective service laws. Before that happened, kids were placed more often on their own conduct, not their parents\u2019 conduct. \n \n That might explain why Matt was removed from his mom\u2019s home and sent to another family, Kutulakis said. \n \n Another possibility: No one else wanted him. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s a fire setter,\u201d Cervone said. \u201cFire setters are radioactive in child placements. They were probably going to have a degree of difficulty placing him. I\u2019m assuming that Second Mile had a relationship with the probation department, so this is the natural pathway, and Sandusky and his wife are among the placement resources.\u201d \n \n \n \n Sandusky writes in his book, \u201cTouched: The Jerry Sandusky Story,\u201d that after Matt attempted suicide, \u201cIt got to the point where the authorities were going to take him away from us, but fortunately two people stepped in and, in our eyes, saved that young man\u2019s life.\u201d \n \n One was a psychologist, who wrote a letter that Long saved, telling the judge that Matt should go back into the Sandusky home. (Matt wrote a similar letter to the judge asking to return.) \n \n The second person, Sandusky wrote, was Judge David E. Grine, now retired and a senior judge in Centre County. Grine said he could not comment on the case. \n \n \u201cWhen you get a psychologist weighing in like that, and it\u2019s between the psychologist and the mom, who are you going to believe?\u201d Cervone said. \u201cI thought it was pretty compelling ... and, the boy\u2019s desire to go back there.\u201d \n \n But not everyone was in agreement. A school-based probation officer, Terry Trude, wrote a letter voicing concern about Matt\u2019s safety, days after the 1996 suicide attempt, saying he did not believe the Sandusky home was the appropriate place for Matt. \n \n \u201cThat was a pretty strong letter, and I would be shocked if there weren\u2019t safeguards put into place to address those issues. ... All those are red flags, but we don\u2019t know what evidence was presented in court,\u201d Kutulakis said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what was actually presented to the judge. The problem is there\u2019s a vacuum, due to time and lack of records, to know exactly what took place.\u201d \n \n Finally, the probation department admitted that protocol wasn\u2019t followed in that a long-term plan for family placement was never established. \n \n Unfortunately, Cervone said, that wasn\u2019t unusual in the 1990s. \n \n \n \n A focal point \n \n It\u2019s not clear if any of this backstory will ever play a role in the criminal case against Sandusky. \n \n Clearly, Matt was a focal point for investigators. But unless he takes the stand \u2014 likely in a defense role \u2014 we won\u2019t know what he told the grand jury about the relationship or how he feels about Sandusky\u2019s role in his life. \n \n Long says she can\u2019t explain why her son won\u2019t talk with her. \n \n Eventually, Ron Heichel and Matt also grew apart, though they never completely stopped talking. And Matt still confided in his brother. \n \n Ron Heichel remembers one conversation vividly. They were still teenagers; Heichel thinks he was 13 or 14. \n \n \u201cHe asked one time, \u2018Have you ever thought about having sex with another man?\u2019 I said, \u2018No, why would that even come up?\u2019 \u201d \n \n The questions got more graphic. \n \n Ron Heichel says he was disgusted. \n \n Years later, he approached the subject again. \n \n \u201cI asked him, since all this came out, and I suspected something back then because he would ask weird questions. He said, \u2018No, don\u2019t be ridiculous.\u2019 ... He\u2019s forgetting that I was his brother for all of these years, I know when he\u2019s being sincere.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n Story so far \n \n \n \n Former Penn State football defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, 68, is facing more than 50 counts of child sex abuse against 10 boys, most of whom he met through his children\u2019s charity, The Second Mile. \n \n Sandusky was first charged Nov. 4, then arrested a second time in December after a three-year investigation by a statewide grand jury. \n \n Almost immediately, the scandal engulfed Penn State. \n \n Two top former officials, Vice President Gary Schultz and Athletic Director Tim Curley, were charged with perjury and failing to report an incident brought to them in 2002 by graduate assistant Mike McQueary. \n \n Schultz and Curley stepped down hours after the charges were filed, and university President Graham Spanier and football coach Joe Paterno were fired days later by the board of trustees. \n \n Paterno, who was diagnosed with lung cancer days after his firing, died Jan. 22 from complications of his treatment. \n \n More than 85 people, some angry with the decision by the board of trustees to fire the 85-year-old coach, are running for one of three seats opening on the board of trustees, and angry alumni are calling for a wholesale change in how the board is comprised. \n \n While the state grand jury continues to meet, federal investigators are also at work, and they appear to be focusing on areas the state\u2019s case hasn\u2019t gone: Penn State and The Second Mile. \n \n Gov. Tom Corbett, who as the state\u2019s attorney general started the investigation into Sandusky, has defended the length of the investigation and rejected claims that it was stalled for political reasons. He has also defended accepting campaign money from board members at Penn State and The Second Mile. \n \n Penn State and The Second Mile are also conducting internal reviews, the NCAA opened an inquiry and the U.S. Department of Education is investigating compliance with the Clery Act, the federal law mandating that universities report crimes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ||||| BELLEFONTE -- Matt Sandusky, through his attorney Andrew Shubin, said that he met with prosecutors this week to say for the first time that he is a molestation victim of Jerry Sandusky, his adopted father. \n \n Matt, 33, was adopted by Jerry and Dottie Sandusky as an adult, after going to live with the family as a foster child. He has denied ever being abused by his adopted father until now. \"This has been an extremely painful experience for Matt and he has asked us to convey his request that the media respect his privacy. There will be no further comment,\" Shubin said in a statement. \n \n Shubin also said Matt was prepared to testify truthfully at trial, if called by prosecutors. It is unclear why he did not testify. \n \n In March, The Patriot-News reported that Matt had a rocky relationship with his adopted father. His biological mother told The Patriot-News she believed Sandusky had stolen her son from her. \n \n His biological mom, Debra Long, testified before the grand jury in early 2011 about strange behavior she says she witnessed between her son and Sandusky. \n \n Matt testified, too. But Sandusky's attorney, Joe Amendola said at the time that he was not worried about Matt's testimony, and that Long was making false allegations because she was angry at the Sandusky family. \n \n During testimony at trial, Victim 4 told jurors that one time Jerry Sandusky began touching him during a shower, Matt Sandusky was present, but left the shower when the assault began.",

It's the first time Matt has made such allegations, though his biological mother testified before a grand jury last year regarding an unsettling relationship between her son and the former coach. Matt had been willing to testify in the current trial, the attorney says, and it's not known why he didn't, the Patriot-News reports. Matt lived as a foster child with Jerry and Dottie Sandusky, who adopted him when he reached adulthood. As far back as 1996, when the Sandusky family took Matt in, his biological mother, Debra Long, raised concerns that the former coach was stalking her son. A March profile of Long in the Patriot-News cites a \"rocky\" relationship between Matt and Jerry; the two were estranged for an extended period, says one source. When Long asked her son if Jerry had touched him, he replied, \"I don't want to talk about it,\" she says.",

    "document": "Roger Ebert, the popular film critic and television co-host who along with his fellow reviewer and sometime sparring partner Gene Siskel could lift or sink the fortunes of a movie with their trademark thumbs up or thumbs down, died on Thursday in Chicago. He was 70. \n \n His death was announced by The Chicago Sun-Times, where he had worked for more than 40 years. No cause was specified, but he had suffered from cancer and related health problems since 2002. \n \n It would not be a stretch to say that Mr. Ebert was the best-known film reviewer of his generation, and one of the most trusted. The force and grace of his opinions propelled film criticism into the mainstream of American culture. Not only did he advise moviegoers about what to see, but also how to think about what they saw. \n \n President Obama reacted to Mr. Ebert\u2019s death with a statement that said, in part: \u201cFor a generation of Americans \u2014 especially Chicagoans \u2014 Roger was the movies. When he didn\u2019t like a film, he was honest; when he did, he was effusive \u2014 capturing the unique power of the movies to take us somewhere magical.\u201d \n \n Mr. Ebert\u2019s struggle with cancer gave him an altogether different public image \u2014 as someone who refused to surrender to illness. Though he had operations for cancer of the thyroid, salivary glands and chin, lost his ability to eat, drink and speak (a prosthesis partly obscured the loss of much of his jaw, and he was fed through a tube for years) and became a gaunter version of his once-portly self, he continued to write reviews and commentary and published a cookbook on meals that could be made with a rice cooker. \n \n \u201cWhen I am writing, my problems become invisible, and I am the same person I always was,\u201d he told Esquire magazine in 2010. \u201cAll is well. I am as I should be.\u201d \n \n In recent years, Mr. Ebert became a prolific presence on Facebook and Twitter, on which he had more than 800,000 followers, and was a blogger as well. \n \n He fired tweets with machine-gun rapidity, on topics both profound and prosaic. He commented on pro football, his captions for The New Yorker cartoon contest, an old pub he once frequented, James Joyce short stories and untold numbers of movies and television shows, to which he linked. \u201cPixar is the first studio that is a movie star,\u201d went one tweet. \n \n He swore he would not become addicted to Twitter, but emphatically did. But Mr. Ebert \u2014 whose handle was @ebertchicago \u2014 never tweeted during a movie. \n \n Mr. Ebert liked to say his approach \u2014 dryly witty, occasionally sarcastic, sometimes quirky in his opinions \u2014 reflected the working newspaper reporter he had been, not a formal student of film. His tastes ran from the classics to boldly independent cinema to cartoons, and his put-downs could be withering. \n \n \u201cI will one day be thin, but Vincent Gallo will always be the director of \u2018The Brown Bunny,\u2019 \u201d he wrote. \n \n His thumbs-up-or-down approach drew scorn from some critics, who said it trivialized film criticism. Speaking to Playboy magazine in 1991, Mr. Ebert agreed that his television program at the time was \u201cnot a high-level, in-depth film-criticism show.\u201d But he argued that it demonstrated to younger viewers that one can bring standards of judgment to movies, that \u201cit\u2019s O.K. to have an opinion.\u201d \n \n In 1975 he became the first film critic to win a Pulitzer Prize, for his Sun-Times reviews. His columns were syndicated to more than 200 newspapers in the United States and abroad, and he wrote more than 15 books, many by skillfully recycling his columns. In 2005 he became the first film critic to be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. \n \n \u201cIn the century or so that there has been such a thing as film criticism, no other critic has ever occupied the space held by Roger Ebert,\u201d Mick LaSalle, movie critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, wrote in 2010. \u201cOthers as influential as Ebert have not been as esteemed. Others as esteemed as Ebert have not had the same direct and widespread influence. And no one, but no one, has enjoyed the same fame.\u201d \n \n With Mr. Siskel, Mr. Ebert popularized television film criticism. Their collaboration began in 1975. Mr. Ebert was asked to appear on WTTW, the public broadcasting station in Chicago, as co-host of a new movie-review program. He was intrigued, but then taken aback when told that Mr. Siskel, the film critic of The Chicago Tribune, would be his partner. \n \n \u201cThe answer was at the tip of my tongue: no,\u201d Mr. Ebert told Time magazine in 1987. \n \n As for Mr. Siskel, he said he initially had no desire to team up with \u201cthe most hated guy in my life.\u201d ||||| I will always regret that I had only one direct exchange with Roger Ebert, and it took place via email. In that brief but (for me) significant correspondence, he proved as kind and gracious a soul as you would expect. Personally, I wish I\u2019d behaved better. \n \n It was on March 6, 2006, the morning after \u201cCrash\u201d won the Oscar for best picture \u2014 an upset in every sense for those of us who were rooting for the presumptive favorite, \u201cBrokeback Mountain.\u201d The resulting online uproar was so intense that it spurred Ebert to write a vigorous defense of Paul Haggis\u2019 film, decrying \u201cthe fury of the \u2018Crash\u2019-lash\u201d and accusing the hardcore \u201cBrokeback\u201d fans of acting in bad faith. More or less proving him right, I lashed out. I fired off a crankily defensive email, lambasting someone I had read and respected for ages but never met, and whom I would have addressed on any other occasion with nothing less than stammering politeness. \n \n See Also: Roger Ebert Dies at 70 Photos \n \n To my surprise, Ebert saw fit not only to publish my letter in his Movie Answer Man column, but also to write me a personal reply, in which he thanked me for getting in touch, conceded some of my points while gently reasserting his own, and told me he respected my work. Shamed but not silenced, I sent back a bloated apology, which occasioned another polite response and an altogether friendlier, more harmonious back-and-forth. I may have started us off on the wrong foot, but Roger redeemed our encounter with his characteristic good nature and genuine delight in engaging with his readers \u2014 the very qualities that made him, for so many of us, an ideal companion at the movies. \n \n My takeaway lesson was that an act of grace, especially one coming from an elder and a superior, will always prevail over a difference of opinion. And it was the consummate grace of Ebert\u2019s voice \u2014 that inimitable blend of wit, erudition, amiability and common sense \u2014 that made him our most important and indispensable film critic, someone you loved to read no matter how violently you disagreed with him. Like all great thinkers and writers, he rendered irrelevant the small-minded tyranny of right and wrong answers through his vivid, literate and unpretentious command of language. His thumbs may have changed the face of criticism, but it is Ebert\u2019s writing for which he will be most fondly and significantly remembered. \n \n We all have our favorites \u2014 in my case, derived from hours spent not watching the various TV shows he made famous with Gene Siskel (although I did that, too), but poring over the review archives on the Chicago Sun-Times\u2019 website. I remember watching \u201cDead Poets Society\u201d in high school and feeling pretty much alone in despising it; I found a kindred spirit in Ebert, who memorably tore the film to shreds: \u201cI was so moved, I wanted to throw up.\u201d A few years later he nailed the beauty and heartache of \u201cThe Sweet Hereafter,\u201d noting that Atom Egoyan\u2019s intricate, time-shuffling film had been constructed \u201cin the simplest possible way. It isn\u2019t about the beginning and end of the plot, but about the beginning and end of the emotions.\u201d \n \n See Also: Hollywood Reacts to Ebert\u2019s Death on Twitter \n \n Ebert always looked for emotion. He could eviscerate a movie with the best of them, but in many ways his work offered precisely the opposite of the cruel cynicism that is assumed to be the critic\u2019s stock-in-trade. In more recent years, he seemed to err increasingly on the side of charity, adopting a sometimes mystifyingly liberal hand with four-star reviews \u2014 a generosity that nonetheless went hand-in-hand with his essentially optimistic view of the medium. \n \n Stories of his support for younger critics are legion, but even as he was fostering aspiring talent, he never stopped showing us how it was done. Too often, when we talk about art, we do so in tones of overly hushed, self-serious reverence, placing it on a forbidding pedestal. As someone who can lapse into all manner of contorted academic language to explain why readers should care about Hou Hsiao-hsien or Nuri Bilge Ceylan, I envy the exquisite simplicity with which Ebert can nail a film like Bela Tarr\u2019s \u201cWerckmeister Harmonies\u201d: \u201cIf you have not walked out after 20 or 30 minutes, you will thereafter not be able to move from your seat.\u201d Without ever once deviating from a conversational tone, Ebert could make watching Welles, Bresson, Ozu and Mizoguchi sound like nothing less than the purest joy. \n \n VIDEO: Roger Ebert Through the Years \n \n In the hands of someone with an unprecedented command of our collective moviegoing minds, this is no small thing. I wanted to applaud when he made the bold decision to include a recent release, \u201cThe Tree of Life,\u201d on his list of the 10 greatest films of all time for the decennial Sight & Sound poll. A critic of his age and stature may well have waited to see if Terrence Malick\u2019s film stood the test of time, but Ebert was nothing if not a forward thinker. Before many of us knew Twitter from Facebook, he had already adapted his work to suit the demands of an online following that grew only more massive as time went on. \n \n It is impossible to quantify the influence that Roger Ebert has had on anyone who cares even remotely about movies and movie criticism. But why limit it to such a narrow range of interest? Inside or outside the often insular, self-protective ranks of film critics, I can think of no writer who has commanded as wide a readership, or been more deeply invested in fostering a dialogue with that readership \u2014 a dialogue that overflowed freely into matters of art, science, religion, morality and politics. There was nothing Ebert couldn\u2019t write about, just as there was seemingly no medium through which his work could not be transmitted. \n \n It is one of the saddest ironies of Ebert\u2019s long, courageous battle with cancer that he was robbed of one of the very things that defined him most: his voice. I speak, gratefully, of his voice in the physical sense, for his real voice never left us and never will. Tirelessly reviewing, blogging and tweeting until the bitter end, he came perhaps as close as anyone can claim to having triumphed over the physical onset of death and its cruelest deprivations. For anyone who ever longed to say something of value about the movies and the world they reflect, he is no less an inspiration in death than he was in life. ||||| Editorial: We were all better for knowing Roger Ebert \n \n Updated: \n \n Do you love what you do? \n \n Do you go to work every day and try to master your job and feel deeply that it matters? Do you believe that you can, through sheer excellence, make it matter even more? \n \n Roger Ebert did. \n \n He loved everything he ever did, and made it matter to all of us, perhaps because he chose wisely. \n \n Roger loved the movies and big ideas and great conversation and hard work. He loved the very idea of living a full and examined life, and he was an inspiration to millions of others. Movie fans adored Roger, of course, but so did all of us who at times can feel that electric surge that is life itself. \n \n Speaking of the vitality of youth, Dylan Thomas once wrote \u2014 and Roger would appreciate the literary allusion \u2014 \u201cThe force that through the green fuse drives the flower drives my green age.\u201d That was Roger, a life force, and it did not fade as his green age grew grey. \n \n Roger grew up in Urbana, a pudgy only child, a questioning Catholic boy, in the thrall even then of movies and journalism and ideas, and blessed even then with a stunning work ethic. As a kid in high school, he would work all night covering sports for the local paper, then hit the bars \u2014 underage \u2014 with those glamorous local reporters he couldn\u2019t get enough of. \n \n Roger moved on to the big city, Chicago, and could never get enough of that, either. He cranked out the smartest stories for the Sun-Times, always delivered in deceptively simple Midwestern prose. Then he\u2019d schmooze into the wee hours with the likes of Nelson Algren and Mike Royko at Riccardo\u2019s and the Billy Goat and, best of all, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s. \n \n But when the drinking got the best of him, Roger quit cold. He wanted to do so much more of everything else \u2014 he knew he had it in him \u2014 and the drinking got in the way. \n \n Roger was unafraid to try his hand. There was his great TV movie review show, \u201cSneak Previews,\u201d with his unlikely friend and competitor, Gene Siskel. There was an awful screenplay. And a better novel. And an excellent blog that should have won him his second Pulitzer Prize. \n \n And we who were lucky to work with him, we who felt such intense pride in being Chicago Sun-Times journalists simply because Roger was one of us, we were all better for his example and friendship. \n \n Roger grew wiser with age. A bit less prideful. A good deal more forgiving. You could see it in his film reviews which, frankly, turned more thumbs up over time. Roger did not agree this was so \u2014 he was as tough as ever, he would insist. But he also once wrote, late in life, that while it is easy to find fault in a film or in any work of art, our obligation to each other is to see and appreciate that which is great. \n \n That was our Roger.

    "document": "CNN's unconscionable coverage of the Steubenville Rape Case verdict is pissing everyone off. Newscaster Candy Crowley, general correspondent Poppy Harlow, and legal expert Paul Callan all did their very best to focus solely on the guilty verdict's repercussions on the two rapists. There's next to no coverage of the girl who was brutally raped; instead, they talk almost exclusively of the rapists\u2014 the two teenagers who had such bright futures, and now their lives are completely ruined from this one little indiscretion. Isn't it a shame how they suffer? \n \n Let's not forget that these boys committed truly despicable acts and to all appearances showed no remorse or regret until they were faced with real-world consequences. But still, wasn't it so sad when they broke down crying upon learning they'll spend a few years in juvie? It was so sad that CNN forgot to talk about the sixteen-year-old girl whose life will be spent dealing with the ramifications of rape. After all, she left the house with a vagina; she KNEW the consequences. \n \n Here's what actually happened on CNN: \n \n When Crowley said she couldn't imagine how emotional it was in the courtroom, Harlow \u2014 who was there and had been inside the courtroom \u2014 responds: \n \n I've never experienced anything like it, Candy. It was incredibly emotional, incredibly difficult, even for an outsider like me, to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures \u2014 star football players, very good students \u2014 literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart...when that sentence came down, [Ma'lik] collapsed in the arms of his attorney...He said to him, 'My life is over. No one is going to want me now.' Very serious crime here, both found guilty of raping the sixteen-year-old girl at a series of parties back in August. Alcohol fueled parties; alcohol is a huge part of this. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Then, after the verdict is read, we watch Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond speak. \n \n Mays says \"I would truly like to apologize to [the girl], her family, my family, and community. Those pictures shouldn't have been sent around, let alone taken.\" \n \n \"I had no intentions of doing anything like that, and I'm sorry I put you guys through it. I'm sorry,\" said Richmond. He was held and comforted; his back was pat. \n \n Advertisement \n \n On top of all that, Harlow makes a big deal out of Ma'lik Richmond's lawyer \u2014 this guy \u2014 telling her that today was the first day Ma'lik's dad told him he loved him \u2014 doesn't your heart just bleed for him? Because without a father's love, a boy just has to rape. \n \n CNN legal contributor Paul Callan then enters the chat. \n \n Crowley inquires: \n \n You know, Paul, a sixteen-year-old now just sobbing in court, regardless of what big football players they are, the other one just seventeen, a sixteen year old victim, they still sound like sixteen-year-olds... The thing is, what's the lasting effect, though, on two young men being found guilty in juvenile court of rape, essentially? \n \n Advertisement \n \n Callan responds: \n \n Well, you know, Candy, we've seen here a courtroom drenched in tears and tragedy.... The most severe thing with these young men is being labeled as registered sex offenders. That label is now placed on them by Ohio law...That will haunt them for the rest of their lives. Employers, when looking up their background, will see that they're registered sex offenders. When they move into a new neighborhood and somebody goes on the Internet, where these things are posted, neighbors will know that they are registered sex offenders. \n \n Jesus \u2014 this stops just short of becoming a full piece on athletes overcoming rape. Such a tragic story for the two teenagers who raped a girl in multiple locations and took pictures and video of it. So sad for them. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Here's what should've happened on CNN: \n \n When Crowley said she couldn't imagine how emotional it was in the courtroom, Harlow \u2014 who was there and had been inside the courtroom \u2014 responds: \n \n Incredibly difficult to watch what happened; these two young rapists that had such promising futures \u2014 star football players, very good students, rapists \u2014 literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart because they brutally raped a girl...when that sentence came down, rapist [Ma'lik] collapsed in the arms of his attorney...the rapist said to him, 'My life is over. No one is going to want me now.' Very serious crime here, both found guilty of raping the sixteen-year-old girl at a series of parties back in August. Alcohol fueled parties; alcohol is a huge part of this, and I'm saying this right now to explain away rape, which is unacceptable. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Then, after the verdict is read, we watch Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond speak. \n \n Mays says \"I would truly like to apologize to [the girl], her family, my family, and community. Those pictures shouldn't have been sent around, let alone taken.\" Also, this. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \"I had no intentions of doing anything like that, and I'm sorry I put you guys through it. I'm sorry,\" said Richmond. \n \n CNN legal contributor Paul Callan then enters the chat. \n \n Crowley inquires: \n \n Sixteen-year-old rapists just sobbing in court, regardless of what big football player rapists they are, they still sound like sixteen-year-old rapists...what's the lasting effect, though, on two young rapists being found guilty in juvenile court of rape, essentially ? \n \n Advertisement \n \n Callahan responds: \n \n Well, you know, Candy, we've seen here a courtroom drenched in tears of a rapist and the tragedy of rape... The most severe thing with these rapists is being labeled as registered sex offenders, and how fucking sad is it that? One gets just two years in a juvenile detention facility, and the other gets JUST ONE YEAR. Isn't that insane, Candy; doesn't it just blow your damn mind? And who knows what kind of rehabilitation they'll actually get; probably next to none. They will most likely exit even more fucked up than they entered, always thinking the worst thing they did was get caught. Perhaps they'll learn to not live-tweet and record their rapes, because jail is probably even worse than juvie \u2014 and they'll probably be tried as adults next time. They won't be taught not to rape; the adults around them continue to make damn sure of that. Their lives should be made difficult by this, but they should also get support and education. In reality, they will only get the first thing, and in all the wrong ways. It's a real shitshow, and heartbreaking to say the least. That label is now placed on them by Ohio law...That will haunt them for the rest of their lives, kind of. Employers, when looking up their background, will see that they're rapists. When they move into a new neighborhood and somebody goes on the Internet, where these things are posted, neighbors will know that they are rapists. That is the worst thing that will happen to them \u2014 can you believe how good they have it? Now, let's spend the rest of this hour long program talking about what the real victim \u2014 you know, the sixteen-year-old girl who was violently raped by her classmates \u2014 will deal with on the difficult, never-ending road that is the life of a rape survivor. Because the rapists might have a little trouble finding an apartment to rent in the future, but she'll be dealing with the trauma of rape for the rest of her life. \n \n Advertisement \n \n That's a little better. \n \n Let's hope we can all stay on message because this isn't over yet. Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine said yesterday that the state will convene a grand jury to investigate further charges in the case. \n \n \"This has been particularly hard for the victim and her family,\" DeWine said. \"As I said already, any rape is a tragedy. But, it is even more of a tragedy when that victim is continually re-victimized in the social media.\" \n \n Advertisement \n \n He's right about the social media thing \u2014 there's already plenty of shitty things flying around \u2014 and it's true that mainstream media can do better, too. \n \n Update: Much like Fox News, CNN failed to redact/censor the victim's name from footage of Trent Mays' courtroom apology. We've since removed the video. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Previously: Steubenville Football Players Found Guilty of Rape \n \n [Raw Story] ||||| As expected, the Internet lit up after the judge announced the guilty verdict in the Steubenville rape trial. As expected, some reactions were just awful. Unexpectedly, one of them came from CNN. \n \n Candy Crowley probably didn't mean to steal the spotlight on Sunday afternoon, when she reported on the breaking news from the Steubenville courtroom where Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond had just been found guilty. After the verdict came in, the CNN anchor turned to correspondent Poppy Harlow, who expressed some strange mixture of emotions. \"Incredibly difficult, even for an outsider like me, to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart,\" said Harlow. Crowley turned to legal expert Paul Callan, who sounded almost apologetic when explaining how the rape conviction will mean that the Steubenville rapists will now be registered sex offenders and how that \"will haunt them for the rest of their lives.\" None of these things said were untrue. But the tone was certainly a little off. \n \n The segment, in general, didn't do CNN any favors. While they're not necessarily rooting for the rapists, even the slightest bit of sympathy didn't go over well, especially once it was lumped together with all of the outrageously offensive reactions of true Steubenville rapist sympathizers. Sarcastic example tweet: \"The Steubenville story is all too familiar. Be responsible for your actions ladies before your drunken decisions ruin innocent lives.\" Sincere example tweet: \"So you got drunk at a party and two people take advantage of you,that's not rape you're just a loose drunk slut.\" Of course, cases like the Steubenville rape trial can be polarizing, and we've long known how distorted some notions of justice can be. \n \n The blogosphere went to town on CNN. Gawker's Mallory Ortberg really didn't appreciate Crowley and company waxing sympathetic about the damage done to the rapists' \"promising futures.\" She wrote, \"Their dreams and hopes were not crushed by an impersonal, inexorable legal system; Mays and Richardson raped a girl and have been sentenced accordingly.\" Ortberg added, \"Reporting like this presents viewers with anonymous female victims and dynamic, sympathetic, complicated male figures.\" That's a strong point, especially since we didn't really hear from the victim until nearly the end of the trial. \n \n That said, the media's actually been grieving the ends of these rapists' young lives for a few days now. It's just a little more infuriating now that they're officially guilty. Just before the trial started, for instance, Good Morning America published a sprawling preview under the headline, \"The Steubenville Rape Case: What You Haven't Heard.\" What follows is a retelling of the whole saga with plenty of attention paid to the \"honors student\" Mays and wrong-side-of-the-tracks Richmond. The piece ends on a sympathetic note, almost bemoaning the fact that the two teens \"face incarceration in a detention center until their 21st birthdays and the almost-certain demise of their dreams of playing football.\" Feeling sorry for the boys was a little bit more acceptable before they were convicted, but still, it hardly feels like objective reporting. \n \n If all this upsets you, don't use up all your rage now. The Steubenville case is hardly over. Next, the state of Ohio will convene a grand jury to investigate further charges, and the media circus will get an encore, if not an entirely new act. All any decent person can do is hope for a little bit more balance. \"As I said already, any rape is a tragedy,\" Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine said after the verdict on Sunday. \"But, it is even more of a tragedy when that victim is continually re-victimized in the social media.\" Let's hope the mainstream media doesn't do the same. \n \n Update, Monday: Even as questions grow about the grand jury hearing, one thing is clear: CNN is not alone \u2014 MSNBC and Fox let the victim's name get on air, too. \n \n Want to add to this story? Let us know in comments.

Star football players Trent Mays, 17, and Ma\u2019lik Richmond, 16, were found guilty of raping a 16-year-old girl. Propelled by social media and mainstream media, the Steubenville case has long held a high profile. \n \n Defense attorney Walter Madison, right, holds his client, 16-year-old Ma\u2019lik Richmond, second from right, while defense attorney Adam Nemann, left, sits with his client Trent Mays, foreground, 17, as the judge reads the decision. (Keith Srakocic/Associated Press) \n \n The scrutiny that comes with its profile descended on CNN. In repeated segments yesterday, CNN featured reports from reporter Poppy Harlow, who was in Ohio for the verdict. Here\u2019s the transcript of some of the coverage at the 11 a.m. hour: \n \n ANNOUNCER: This is CNN breaking news. \n \n CANDY CROWLEY, CNN ANCHOR: I\u2019m Candy Crowley in Washington. RELIABLE SOURCES is just ahead. \n \n But, first, a breaking story we\u2019re following. \n \n Two star football players in Steubenville, Ohio, have been found guilty of raping a West Virginia teenager. The story has attracted national attention. The judge just ruled a few minutes ago. Listen in. \n \n (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \n \n JUDGE THOMAS LIPPS, HAMILTON COUNTY FAMILY COURT: In this case, you know, regarding the charges of rape, both defendants Ma\u2019lik Richmond and Trent Mays are committed to the Department of Youth Services for a minimum of one year and a maximum period until you\u2019re 21. \n \n (END VIDEO CLIP) \n \n CROWLEY: Again, this case was played out in juvenile court, that is why there was a judge, no jury. He decided on the verdict, as well as, you heard there, talking about the sentence. \n \n We want to go now to CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow. She is in Steubenville, and has been covering this trial. \n \n I cannot imagine having just watched this on the feed coming in. How emotional that must have been sitting in the courtroom. \n \n POPPY HARLOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I\u2019ve never experienced anything like it, Candy. It was incredibly emotional \u2014 incredibly difficult even for an outsider like me to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believe their life fell apart. \n \n One of \u2014 one of the young men, Ma\u2019lik Richmond, when that sentence came down, he collapsed. He collapsed in the arms of his attorney, Walter Madison. He said to me, \u201cMy life is over. No one is going to want me now.\u201d \n \n Very serious crime here. Both found guilty of raping this 16- year-old girl at a series of parties back in August, alcohol-fueled parties. Alcohol is a huge part in this. \n \n [\u2026] \n \n I want to bring in Paul Callan, our CNN legal contributor. \n \n You know, Paul, a 16-year-old now just sobbing in court, regardless of what big football players they are, still sound like 16 year olds. The other one, 17. A 16-year-old victim. \n \n The thing is, when you listen to it and you realize that they could stay until they\u2019re 21, they are going to get credit for time served. What\u2019s the lasting effect, though, on two young men being found guilty in juvenile court of rape, essentially? \n \n PAUL CALLAN, CNN LEGAL CONTRIBUTOR: Well, you know, Candy, we\u2019ve seen here a courtroom drenched in tears and tragedy and, you know, Poppy\u2019s description, I think, you know, sums it all up. But across America scenes like this happen all the time. \n \n I know as a prosecutor and defense attorney, when that verdict is handed down, usually it\u2019s just the family and families of the defendants and the victims, there\u2019s always that moment of just lives are destroyed. And lives have already been destroyed by the crime. And we got a chance to see that. \n \n But in terms of what happens now, yes, the most severe thing with these young men is being labeled as registered sex offenders. That label is now placed on them by Ohio law and, by the way, the laws in most other states now require such a designation in the face of such a serious crime. \n \n That will haunt them for the rest of their lives. Employers, when looking up their background, will see they\u2019re registered sex offender. When they move into a new neighborhood and somebody goes on the Internet where these things are posted. Neighbors will know they\u2019re a registered sex offender. \n \n It\u2019s really something that will have a lasting impact. Much more of a lasting impact than going to a juvenile facility for one or two years. \n \n CROWLEY: Paul, thanks. I want to bring Poppy back in \u2014 because, Poppy, there\u2019s \u2014 you know, the 16-year-old victim, her life, never the same, again. And I understand you have been talking to some of the families involved. \n \n HARLOW: Her life never the same again. Absolutely, Candy. The last thing she wanted to do was sit on that stand and testify. She didn\u2019t want to bring these charges. She said it was up to her parents. \n \n But I want to tell our viewers about a statement that her mother just made, just made in the court after the sentencing. Her mother just said that she has pity on the two young boys that did this. She said human compassion is not taught by teachers or coaches. It\u2019s a God-given gift, saying that you displayed a lack of compassion, a lack of moral code, saying that you were your own accuser throughout this for posting about this all over social media. And she said she takes pity on them. ||||| Journalists took to Twitter Sunday to criticize the media\u2019s coverage of the two teenage boys who were found guilty in the Steubenville, Ohio, rape case. \n \n Lauren Wolfe, Xeni Jardin and others called out CNN\u2019s Poppy Harlow and Paul Callan for sympathizing with the men and highlighting that the woman who was raped was \u201callegedly drunk.\u201d On Monday, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC aired the woman\u2019s name. Think Progress called the move \u201can act of serious journalistic negligence.\u201d \n \n \u201cWhat I\u2019m so furious about, after the act perpetrated on this young woman, is our media\u2019s take. Mainstream media, of course, reflects society \u2014 so in this case, they reflect rape culture. But shouldn\u2019t we expect more from the media? Aren\u2019t there such things as news judgment and context and analysis?\u201d said Wolfe, director of the Women\u2019s Media Center\u2019s Women Under Siege project. \n \n \u201cWhy is nearly no outlet \u2026 bothering to ask what\u2019s wrong with masculinity in this country, with the arrogance of those defending a football team rather than a young woman who was violated? How could the media possibly be putting the emphasis on [the fact that] the girl drank? Did the boys not drink?\u201d \n \n Wolfe also criticized Nightline for saying the Steubenville debacle is a \u201ccautionary tale for teenagers living in today\u2019s digital world.\u201d \n \n \u201cAs if the problem was what the boys did online, not that they raped a 16-year-old girl and then bragged about it publicly,\u201d Wolfe said. \n \n CNN\u2019s Harlow talked about how the charge against the two young men \u201cliterally watched as their life fell apart.\u201d She didn\u2019t talk, though, about the traumatic effects that rape can have on young women. \n \n Several times in the past, news organizations have left out important context or used language that suggests the rape victim was at fault. The New York Times was criticized for doing this in 2011 while covering a gang rape in Cleveland, Texas. \n \n When journalists first began covering the Steubenville case earlier this year, they revealed little about the young woman. Because she hadn\u2019t spoken out and her identity was being protected, coverage focused mostly on the men. In January, for instance, Matt Lauer interviewed the attorney and ex-guardians of Ma\u2019lik Richmond, one of the teenagers who has been found guilty. \n \n Richmond\u2019s ex-guardians portrayed him in a positive light and said they supported him. Childhood photos of Richmond flashed across the screen as they talked. At the time, it was hard not to wonder, \u201cHow is this affecting the young woman? Is there anyone to advocate for her?\u201d \n \n There was also a lot of talk in the media about the teenage boys\u2019 roles as football players, aka \u201cglorified athlete suspects.\u201d In January, BuzzFeed\u2019s Katie Heaney wrote that an accuser\u2019s athletic achievements can serve as \u201ca legitimate alibi absolving them of wrongdoing.\u201d \n \n Salon\u2019s Irin Carmon touched upon this issue when describing CNN\u2019s coverage (which Gawker also criticized). \n \n \u201cYes, networks are limited in how much footage they can show when it comes to the victim and her family, whereas they can show the boys\u2019 emotional breakdowns, but Harlow was narrating events and not limited to footage. Yes, these boys are young. But the seriousness of their crimes was utterly glossed over in favor of a sideshow about whether a father told his son he loved him,\u201d she said via email. \u201cWe rarely see such compassion evinced for young offenders when the crime isn\u2019t rape, or when they lack the social status of football players.\u201d \n \n Wolfe and Carmon both pointed to a journalist who did a good job covering Sunday\u2019s Steubenville news: Yahoo Sports\u2019 Dan Wetzel. Wolfe praised his column for \u201cgoing beyond the obvious\u201d and \u201csmashing victim-blaming.\u201d \n \n Wetzel wrote about the complexities of town where \u201ca culture of extreme arrogance collapse[d] in two tearful rape convictions.\u201d \n \n Put in the spotlight was the local football team, which, critics said, allowed players to brazenly operate seemingly above the law for years. Social-media accounts, self-made videos, photos and classless text messages exposed an entire world that seemed like a Hollywood script of a high school team out of control. \n \n He also offered context about the seriousness of rape: \n \n Rape, experts say, is a crime of power and control more than sex. Underlying all of that is arrogance, and in Steubenville it was taken to the extreme. \n \n There\u2019s no doubt that covering rape is difficult; it takes time and resources to report on the nuances of the crime, offer context about how common rape is, and explore both sides of the story. But that\u2019s exactly the kind of reporting we need more of. \n \n [&amp;amp;lt;a href=\"//storify.com/mallarytenore/reactions-to-media-coverage-of-steubenville-rape-c\" target=\"_blank\"&amp;amp;gt;View the story \"Reactions to media coverage of Steubenville rape case\" on Storify&amp;amp;lt;/a&amp;amp;gt;] ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine \n \n This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) \n \n The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. ||||| CNN's coverage of the verdict in the Steubenville rape case appeared to be curiously weighted on Sunday, focusing on the effect the guilty verdict would have on the lives of the now-convicted rapists and their families, rather than that of the victim and her family. \n \n Steubenville High School football players Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, were accused of raping a severely intoxicated 16-year-old West Virginia girl who also attends the Ohio school. Thousands of text messages introduced in the case presented a picture of teens swapping graphic stories about the assault. \n \n In a Sunday afternoon segment, anchor Fredricka Whitfield followed the straight news of the guilty verdict (which she described as rape occurring \"after a night of heavy partying\") by showing the rapists' parents' weeping in court. Footage of Richmond, his mother and father offering emotional appeals to the victim's family dominated the segment. \n \n Whitfield threw the story to reporter Poppy Harlow, but not before reiterating that Mays and Richmond's \"family members tried their hardest to plead for some forgiveness from the victim's family, as well as from the judge.\" \n \n To her credit, Harlow appeared to try and correct the segment's tone: \"That's true Fredricka,\" she said of the tears of the convicted rapist's families, \"but this is an incredibly serious crime, it's the crime of rape.\" \n \n And yet, the effects of the rape on the victim seemed to be an afterthought: \"It was incredibly emotional, it was difficult for anyone in there to watch those boys break down,\" Harlow said. \"[It was] also difficult, of course, for the victim's family.\" \n \n \"Also difficult, of course?\" Over the course of the segment, CNN twice aired Richmond's father's appeal for forgiveness in full and also included footage from an interview in which Harlow asks Richmond if it's true that he told Ma'like he loved him for the first time after the verdict came down. The father emotionally explained that he blames himself for the incident because he wasn't \"around\" enough. \"I want to stress that parents need to get involved more in their kids' lives,\" Nathaniel Richmond said. \n \n CNN did air the entirety of the victim's mother's statement on the verdict, but that came after the tears of the Richmond, his mother and father. \n \n The Sunday afternoon segment was hardly the first time CNN had fumbled its coverage of the case. Earlier on Sunday, anchor Candy Crowley expressed her deepest sympathies for Mays and Richmond. \n \n Harlow set up the scene, which she said was \"incredibly difficult\" to watch, thusly: \"These two young men -- who had such promising futures, star football players, very good students -- literally watched as they believed their life fell apart.\" \n \n \"What's the lasting effect though on two young men being found guilty juvenile court of rape essentially?\" Crowley asked CNN's legal analyst Paul Callan. \n \n The slant of the day's coverage was revealing in two capacities. First, CNN appears to have bet on the emotions of those it could show on camera -- for obvious reasons, the victim's identity has been protected, and the victim's family was not shown weeping in court. Networks know that people crying make for great TV. Secondly, it's telling that this tone continued over multiple segments, despite a cadre of tweets and blog posts deriding the network's earlier coverage. \n \n Later on Sunday, Whitfield wrapped the first segment of her coverage on the case by describing it as \"a heart-breaking case to watch, no matter how you look at it.\" That CNN can find so many ways to look at a rape trial is perhaps to blame for their embarrassing and damaging coverage. \n \n Correction: This post incorrectly attributed the quote describing the courtroom scene as \"incredibly difficult\" to Candy Crowley and has since been corrected to note that the quote comes from Poppy Harlow. \n \n WATCH: \n \n \n \n Others noticing CNN's faulty coverage: \n \n Loading Slideshow \n \n \n \n Flavia Dzodan CNN a month ago: OMG SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR THOSE POOR INDIAN WOMEN!

Another angle reporters can take is to publicly worry about the \"promising future\" of the convicted rapists, now less promising as a direct result of their choice to rape someone. \n \n Reporters at CNN today chose the latter technique. General correspondent Poppy Harlow, speaking to anchor Candy Crowley, had this to say about the verdict: \n \n \"Incredibly difficult, even for an outsider like me, to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart...when that sentence came down, [Ma'lik] collapsed in the arms of his attorney...He said to him, 'My life is over. No one is going to want me now.' Very serious crime here, both found guilty of raping the sixteen-year-old girl at a series of parties back in August.\" \n \n CNN also played footage of both convicted rapists tearfully apologizing in court. Harlow went on to describe in detail an emotional exchange between Ma'lik Richmond, one of the defendants, and his estranged father. \n \n Candy asked Paul Callan, a legal expert, to elaborate on the future of the two young men, stressing their youth and emotional vulnerability. \n \n \"Sixteen-year-olds just sobbing in court, regardless of what big football players they are, they still sound like sixteen-year-olds...what's the lasting effect, though, on two young men being found guilty in juvenile court of rape, essentially?\" \"The most severe thing with these young men is being labeled as registered sex offenders. That label is now placed on them by Ohio law...That will haunt them for the rest of their lives. Employers, when looking up their background, will see that they're registered sex offenders. When they move into a new neighborhood and somebody goes on the Internet, where these things are posted, neighbors will know that they are registered sex offenders.\" \n \n Yes, that is how the sex offender registry works. People who commit acts of sexual violence (rape, for example) and are convicted in a court of law are required to register with the national sex offender public registry, so that future employers and neighbors might do things like check said registry. \n \n For readers interested in learning more about how not to be labeled as registered sex offenders, a good first step is not to rape unconscious women, no matter how good your grades are. Regardless of the strength of your GPA (weighted or unweighted), if you commit rape, there is a possibility you may someday be convicted of a sex crime. This is because of your decision to commit a sex crime instead of going for a walk, or reading a book by Cormac McCarthy. Your ability to perform calculus or play football is generally not taken into consideration in a court of law. Should you prefer to be known as \"Good student and excellent football player Trent Mays\" rather than \"Convicted sex offender Trent Mays,\" try stressing the studying and tackling and giving the sex crimes a miss altogether. \n \n It's perfectly understandable, when reporting on a rape trial, to discuss the length and severity of the sentence; it is less understandable to discuss the end of two convicted rapists' future athletic and academic careers as if it were somehow divorced from the laws of cause and effect. Their dreams and hopes were not crushed by an impersonal, inexorable legal system; Mays and Richmond raped a girl and have been sentenced accordingly. Had they not raped her, they would not be spending at least one year each in a juvenile detention facility. \n \n It is unlikely that Candy Crowley and Poppy Harlow are committed rape apologists; more likely they simply wanted a showy, emotional angle at the close of a messy and sensationalized trial. Since the identity of the victim is protected, and the rapists obliged the camera crews by memorably breaking down and crying in court, they found an angle to match: extremely gifted young men were brought tragically low by... mumblemumblesomething. \n \n That isn't how rape trials ought to be discussed by professional journalists. \n \n Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond are not the \"stars\" of the Steubenville rape trial. They aren't the only characters in a drama playing out in eastern Ohio. And yet a CNN viewer learning about the Steubenville rape verdict is presented with dynamic, sympathetic, complicated male figures, and a nonentity of an anonymous victim, the \"lasting effects\" of whose graphic, public sexual assault are ignored. Small wonder, then, that anyone would find themselves on the side of these men\u2014these poor young men, who were very good at taking tests and playing sports when they were not raping their classmates. ||||| The nation's eyes will be focused this week on what happens inside a tiny Steubenville, Ohio, courthouse. The juvenile trial set to begin there is every parent's nightmare and a cautionary tale for teenagers living in today's digital world. \n \n Steubenville is a town used to having media attention lavished on a much different building. In the middle of this city of 18,000 nestled on the Eastern border of Ohio stands Harding Stadium, the crown jewel of this former steel town. Nicknamed Death Valley, the 10,000-seat structure is home to the Big Red football team, one of Ohio's most storied high school programs. \n \n Steubenville is a place where football is more than just a past time; it's a religion. And residents here worship on Friday nights. \n \n Every time Big Red scores, a sculpture of a stallion named Man O' War breathes a 6-foot stream of fire into the night sky over Harding Stadium. But this past season, the team's second-round playoff defeat was overshadowed by a very different firestorm that engulfed the team and the entire town. \n \n Steubenville Launches Website on Alleged Teen Rape \n \n Just as the season was gearing up late last summer, two Big Red football players were accused of participating in the rape of a 16-year-old intoxicated girl with friends documenting the alleged crime through cellphone pictures and video. The social media frenzy took on a life of its own, with reports going as far as calling the incident a \"gang-rape\" of an unconscious girl. In reality, prosecutors contend that Trent Mays, 17, and Ma'lik Richmond, 16, used their hands to penetrate her while she was too drunk to consent, By Ohio law, such a crime constitutes rape, as it does in many places. \n \n At least three other Steubenville students say they witnessed the alleged encounters, and still others heard about them and posted messages, photographs and videos about the incident on social media sites. \n \n See the full story on ABC's \"20/20\" Friday, March 22, at 10 p.m. \n \n The news soon spread beyond Steubenville, leading both hacker-activists and women's advocacy groups to blow the lid off the story nationally, questioning why people who knew about the allegations weren't also charged under an Ohio law requiring people to report crimes of which they're aware. \n \n The uproar surrounding the case soon split the town into two furious camps; one that firmly believes there's a conspiracy to cover up a \"rape culture\" among the football team, and the other believing that the town's once-stellar reputation is being unfairly tarnished by outsiders who don't know all the facts. \n \n Now, documents and photographs obtained exclusively by \"20/20,\" along with never-before-seen taped police interviews with many of the teenage party goers, are shedding light on many of the facts of the case for the first time. \n \n On the night of Aug. 11, 2012, Big Red ran a scrimmage to show off the team's newest talent. Trent Mays was a quarterback and honors student from a town 15 minutes outside of Steubenville. With a football coach for a father, Trent had the sport in his DNA. Ever since he could remember, he shared a dream that so many boys in this corner of the Ohio Valley do; to one day hear the roar of Big Red fans from the field. \n \n A favorite target for Trent that night was wide receiver Ma'lik Richmond. \n \n Ma'lik came from the rougher side of Steubenville. His earliest memories involve dodging stray bullets in his living room and watching most of his male role models being killed or incarcerated. He had turned to sports early in life as an escape from the realities around him. \n \n That night, Trent and Ma'lik helped propel Big Red to victory. For the faithful who filled the stands, it was tempting to fantasize about winning a 10th state championship. For the players, it was an excuse to party. \n \n Hours after the game, Trent, still relishing his role in Big Red's win, was receiving text messages from a girl he had been flirting with over social media, according to his lawyer. She was from just over the Ohio River in Weirton, W.Va., and, his lawyer says, persuaded him to come to a party where she was with several girlfriends. \n \n Party No. 1: \n \n When Trent and Ma'lik arrived, the narrow street outside the house of the party was crammed with cars. By some estimates, there were as many as 40 to 50 teenagers there and no adults. What was in abundance was alcohol, according to Ma'lik and several of the attendees. Witnesses said the girl who invited Trent was one of the more tipsy teens there. \n \n \"She had her arm wrapped around me and one hand on my chest. It just felt like she was coming on to me,\" Ma'lik told ABC News' Elizabeth Vargas in an exclusive interview for \"20/20.\" \n \n After midnight, the party was breaking up. The intoxicated girl, who would soon be at the center of a rape investigation, made it clear she wanted to leave with Trent, according to the police interviews with several of her friends. They also said she resisted their pleas for her not to leave with a car full of boys. \n \n Nevertheless, the girl got into a car with Trent, Ma'lik and two other boys and drove off. In her interview with police exclusively obtained by ABC News, the alleged victim says there is little she remembers from the time between the first party and waking up the next morning. \n \n \"I remember everything that happened at the girl's house I was at but I don't remember anything past the point of me walking off the porch with him,\" she told them. \n \n Party No. 2: \n \n When the five teenagers arrived at the next house, the group was much smaller. There are contradictory accounts about whether the girl was able to walk into the house on her own or needed help from Ma'lik and Trent. \n \n Feeling ill, the girl was taken to the bathroom where she threw up. When she emerged, a photo of her was taken that would become a flashpoint in the case. The photo shows Trent and Ma'lik's holding the girl by her arms and legs with her head hanging back. It is unclear from the picture whether her eyes are open and witness accounts conflict on the exact context of this photo. \n \n The boy who took it, and ultimately uploaded it to his Instagram account, was another football player for Big Red and an ex-boyfriend of the intoxicated girl in the picture. \n \n \"She was just like laughing, we were all talking, just clowning around and that's when her ex-boyfriend was like, 'Let me get a picture of this drunk B. And that's when we took the picture,\" Ma'lik told ABC News. \n \n The picture, Ma'lik maintains, was intended as a joke; he says the girl was conscious, was playing along and was not carried out of the house that way. The girl's civil attorney, Bob Fitzsimmons, calls this characterization \"bizarre.\" \n \n \"It's common sense as to what's going on in that picture,\" he said. \n \n Adds Fitzsimmons: \"My client was unconscious that night. She doesn't have any memory of what happened.\" \n \n ABC News does not name the victims of alleged sexual assaults. \n \n Several witnesses said that once outside, the girl needed to stop in the street because she was sick again. \"She throws up on her blouse and takes her blouse off,\" Ma'lik said. \"And then she asked for something to drink and I gave her my jacket to cover her up.\" \n \n After several minutes, the girl got back into the car with those same four boys. It is during this ride that prosecutors contend Trent raped the alleged victim. One of Trent's teammates, who was seated in the backseat, told police that he used his phone to videotape Trent exposing the girl's breasts and penetrating her vaginally with his fingers. The girl was talking but he could not decipher her slurred speech, he told police. \n \n But Ma'lik, who was seated in the front passenger seat, told ABC News that she was participating. \"I turned around and I can see the flash on his phone. Trent was rubbing on her breasts and she was kissing his neck. And then he was trying to unbutton her pants,\" Ma'lik said. \n \n Police would never see the video because, by the next morning, he had deleted it from his phone. \n \n Party No. 3 \n \n That same boy who videotaped the alleged rape in the car, and who is now a key prosecution witness, testified that when the car arrived at his home, the alleged victim was again taken to the bathroom to throw up. \n \n When the girl emerged, prosecutors say, a second alleged rape occurred. The eyewitness told police that he saw Trent trying to get the girl to perform oral sex on him while she was lying on the floor. Next, he says he saw both Trent and Ma'lik's lying beside her, sexually touching the girl's groin area with their hands. At least one other witness claims to have seen the alleged rape. \n \n \"I wouldn't say she was completely passed out but she wasn't in any state to make a decision for herself,\" one of the eyewitnesses told police. \n \n A defense attorney for Ma'lik told Vargas of \"20/20\" that the alleged victim was conscious enough to provide the pass codes for her cellphone at some point after the second alleged assault. \n \n \"That doesn't sound like a person that's incapacitated to the point where they cannot answer a question, let alone consent,\" defense attorney Walter Madison said. \n \n The girl's civil attorney challenges such an assessment, saying, \"The mere fact that someone presents an argument doesn't make it true.\" \n \n The Steubenville rumor mill was already beginning to churn with speculation about what happened to the intoxicated girl. Naked photos of the girl that were circulated that night fueled a series of tweets and also one YouTube video of an 18-year-old former Steubenville baseball player named Michael Nodianos. In the rambling 12-minute rant, Nodianos, who wasn't present during the alleged rapes, made jokes about the incident, repeatedly referring to the victim as \"dead.\" \n \n When the sun finally rose over Steubenville the next morning, the 16-year-old alleged victim woke up naked in a home she had never been to before. Her girlfriends, who spent much of the previous night trying to contact her and anxiously reading tweets posted about her, soon were summoned to pick her up. \n \n ABC News has learned that one of the girls who picked up the alleged victim told police, \"She and Trent were just lying on the couch together as if nothing happened. She looked hung over but then she got up and was completely fine.\" \n \n By the next day, so much had been written and uploaded to social networking sites that the town was abuzz with rumors and innuendo. Even the girl's parents found out by word of mouth. \n \n They brought her to the hospital Aug. 13, more than 24 hours after the incident. By then, she had already showered and her clothes from that night had been washed. No physical evidence of a rape was recovered. \n \n Nevertheless, 10 days after the alleged assault, on the strength of the witness accounts, Ma'lik Richmond and Trent Mays were arrested in the middle of the night and charged with rape and kidnapping (the kidnapping charge was later dropped.) Trent was also charged with disseminating child pornography for texting naked photos of the underage alleged victim. \n \n \"They sent three or four police cars,\" Trent's mom, Linda Mays, told ABC News. \"They surrounded the house and it was surreal.\" \n \n By this time, many of the social media posts and pictures had been deleted. But not all were lost. ABC News has learned that, in addition to the picture of the defendants' carrying the alleged victim, they also recovered two additional photos from Trent's phone. One of the photos shows the alleged victim lying naked and face down on the floor and the other shows her naked on the couch seemingly asleep. \n \n The intersection of idolized athletes, social media over-sharing and reckless teen behavior proved an explosive combination and the story soon went national. In December, the Nodianos video was re-posted by an offshoot of the Internet hacking group Anonymous called Knight Sec. \n \n The video quickly went viral and appeared to be proof to online activist groups and even the National Organization for Women that other athletes either witnessed or knew of the alleged assault and were never charged with a crime. \n \n Such sentiments have fueled much speculation of a cover up in Steubenville. Nodianos, who until this winter was attending Ohio State University on an academic scholarship, told police he only saw the alleged victim in passing that night as she left the second location. The details he talked about in the video came from viewing one photo of the alleged victim and talking to the other boys who were with her that night, he said. \n \n His lawyer has since issued an apology on his behalf for the shameful comments he made on the video posted on YouTube. \n \n Prosecutors have not commented on the specifics of the case but at the probable cause hearing in October, prosecutor Marianne Hemmeter said, \"She was a toy to them that night and the bottom line is we don't have to prove that she said no. All we have to prove is when she's being penetrated that she was unresponsive and not in a position to consent and they knew it.\" \n \n Attorneys for Trent and Ma'lik insist that their clients are not guilty of any crime, claiming that she was sober enough throughout the night to consent. \n \n \"What we believe we will be able to support is that she voluntarily proceeded throughout the night with our client,\" Trent's attorney, Brian Duncan, told ABC News. \"There is no indication that she was somehow so intoxicated that she could not have consented to any of the contact that occurred.\" \n \n Ma'lik's attorney, Walter Madison, is equally confident in his client's innocence. He questions the prosecution's dependence on testimony from the three teenage witnesses. \n \n \"They all have immunity and have been granted deals not to be prosecuted for their involvement,\" he said. \"When you give a child an option to have a seat at the trial table or tell us what we need to know and in exchange we won't prosecute you, they're probably going to tell you what you want to hear.\" \n \n Attorney General DeWine denied that any deals have been made and won't rule out future charges for those witnesses. \n \n The alleged victim is slated to take the stand, but because she says she has little memory of the night in question, her testimony is not expected to clarify the events of Aug. 11-12. Defense attorneys say the intense scrutiny the case has garnered is creating another challenge for them. \n \n \"We have found it very difficult to find people willing to talk to us,\" Duncan, Trent's attorney, said. \"People have either not returned calls or they have lawyers that are involved. We have material subpoenas that have been issued.\" \n \n A West Virginia judge Friday refused to enforce those subpoenas for three juveniles who reside just outside of Ohio. The judge cited a lack of legal precedence for compelling an underage witness to testify in a juvenile proceeding out of state. \n \n When the trial commences Wednesday, there will be no jury involved. Instead, a juvenile judge will decide the fates of Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond, who face incarceration in a detention center until their 21st birthdays and the almost-certain demise of their dreams of playing football. \n \n See the full story on ABC's \"20/20\" Friday, March 22, at 10 p.m.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 CNN is getting slammed everywhere from Twitter to the blogosphere to mainstream media today, thanks to its coverage of the Steubenville rape verdict yesterday. After the teen boys were found guilty, anchor Candy Crowley kicked it to her reporter by saying, \"I cannot imagine having just watched this on the feed coming in. How emotional that must have been sitting in the courtroom.\" Correspondent Poppy Harlow responded, \"It was ... incredibly difficult even for an outsider like me to watch what happened as these two young men that had such promising futures, star football players, very good students, literally watched as they believe their life fell apart.\" More of the same followed, as Crowley, Harlow, and legal contributor Paul Callan continued to focus on the rapists rather than on the victim. Washington Post has a full transcript. A sample of the reactions: How about calling the boys what they are, suggests Laura Beck on Jezebel. The coverage should have been more along the lines of, \"These two young rapists that had such promising futures\u2014star football players, very good students, rapists\u2014literally watched as they believed their lives fell apart because they brutally raped a girl.\" \"Trent Mays and Ma'lik Richmond are not the 'stars' of the Steubenville rape trial,\" writes Mallory Ortberg on Gawker. \"They aren't the only characters in a drama playing out in eastern Ohio. And yet a CNN viewer learning about the Steubenville rape verdict is presented with dynamic, sympathetic, complicated male figures, and a nonentity of an anonymous victim.\" The Huffington Post rounds up some of the incensed tweets, and editor Kia Makarechi calls the coverage \"embarrassing and damaging.\" Other portions of CNN's coverage were similarly problematic, one activist points out to Poynter, such as the fact that the journalists focused on the victim being drunk. And CNN wasn't the only network with issues in its coverage, she adds: Nightline called the case a \"cautionary tale for teenagers living in today's digital world.\" Good Morning America also got in on the act, the Atlantic Wire notes. Before the conviction, the show offered up \"a sprawling preview ... with plenty of attention paid to the 'honors student' Mays and wrong-side-of-the-tracks Richmond. The piece ends on a sympathetic note, almost bemoaning the fact that the two teens 'face incarceration in a detention center until their 21st birthdays and the almost-certain demise of their dreams of playing football.'\" The Frisky points out that the Onion brilliantly parodied this very circumstance back in 2011.",

    "document": "Nastassja Kinski praises sister for reporting sex abuse \n \n Nastassja Kinski is seen here in 1993 \n \n Continue reading the main story Related Stories \n \n The actress Nastassja Kinski has praised her half-sister Pola for her courage in reporting that their late father Klaus abused her as a child. \n \n Pola said she had been abused between the ages of five and 19 by the actor, who died in 1991 after a career making some of Germany's most notable films. \n \n Nastassja was quoted by Bild newspaper as saying she was \"deeply shocked\" by the revelations. \n \n But she was proud, she added, that Pola had found the strength to speak out. \n \n The elder sister, 60, made the revelations in an interview published by Stern magazine on Thursday, ahead of the publication of her autobiography. \n \n Klaus Kinski acted in spaghetti westerns before starring in films by director Werner Herzog which included Aguirre The Wrath of God (1972), Nosferatu the Vampyre (1979) and Fitzcarraldo (1982). \n \n Revered by many for his film work long after his death, he was also famous for his numerous sexual liaisons with adults. \n \n 'Heroine' \n \n Klaus Kinski died in 1991 \n \n \"My sister is a heroine, because she has freed her heart, her soul and also her future from the weight of the secret,\" Nastassja Kinski said. \n \n \"This is a difficult moment for me. I am on my sister's side, I support her. I am deeply shocked.\" \n \n The actress, 51, whose films include Roman Polanski's Tess and Paris Texas by Wim Wenders, said she had read Pola's words and wept. \n \n Pola's book Kindermund, she argued, would help \"all the children, adolescents and mothers who fear their father and swallow this fear to hide it in the depths of their souls\". \n \n Pola Kinski, herself an actress, spoke to Stern ahead of the release of her autobiography. \n \n She said she had decided to speak out about the abuse because of the continuing adulation for her father. \n \n \"The terrible thing is that he once told me that it was completely natural, that fathers all over the world did that with their daughters,\" she said. \n \n \"He was paying for me to be his little sex object, placed on silk cushions.\" \n \n A biographer of Klaus Kinski, Christian David, told BBC News there had been rumours about the relationship between the actor and Pola for years before this week's revelations. ||||| Two questions are enough to reveal the deep complexity of German actor Klaus Kinski's appeal: Why are we so fascinated with him? And why are we simultaneously so repelled? \n \n The answer to both questions is the same. It was his madness, his not always successful tightrope walk between sanity and lunacy. And it is an answer that remains unchanged even after his daughter's disturbing interview this week, in which she said he had sexually abused her. \n \n The first reaction to the news was a visceral one: Will it ever be possible to enjoy being a Kinski fan again? Or is it even possible to continue being a Kinski fan at all? Still, given Kinski's unique genius for providing an unobstructed glimpse into his disturbed soul, the confirmation of evil somehow fit seamlessly into our overall image of him. \n \n It is an image that began with his voice. In his famous German language recitation of Frenchman Fran\u00e7ois Villon's poetry, it pulsates and erupts with emotion; he needs but a breath to move from violence to tenderness. And both were part of his schizophrenic personality. To hear it is to accept that the voice's owner must be borderline insane. Or a genius. Or an insane genius, which is how we prefer our geniuses to be. \n \n It is obvious to viewers of Kinski's most important films that this madness is not acted, but a state that he could easily cross into. The films he made with Werner Herzog were particularly bleak journeys, and not just into the lost biographies of his heroes, all of whom were diabolical characters. They were also trips into the soul of his tortured lead actor -- and that is what gave his works such power. \n \n Tormented by an Egomaniac \n \n In \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God,\" Kinski was the conquistador who drove his men into death, leaving just the monkeys of the jungle at the end. In \"Fitzcarraldo,\" he plays a wraithlike adventurer who wants to build an opera house in the heart of the wilderness. In \"Nosferatu,\" he portrayed a deceitfully innocent-looking vampire who robbed souls. In \"Cobra Verde,\" he was a slaveholder and child molester. It was only in \"Woyzeck\" that Kinski failed. The original figure was an underling at the mercy of others -- and that is a role that Kinski was unable to play. Klaus Kinski, after all, only ever played himself. \n \n Nobody knew that better than director Werner Herzog. Indeed, it would be interesting to know how he feels about the allegations of abuse levelled against him by his daughter. Because Herzog belongs to that group of people who, in their own way, were all tormented somehow by the egomaniac Kinski, who died in 1991. As a 13-year-old, Herzog shared an apartment with Kinski for three months, when the young actor \"from the very first moment terrorized everyone\" with his fits of rage, Herzog said. Just how traumatic this experience must have been for the sensitive youth who went on to become a filmmaker is depicted in the documentary \"My Best Fiend.\" \n \n Herzog got to know Kinski as a wild-eyed madman, which is exactly how he cast him in his films. The result was a series of masterpieces bristling with the kind of megalomaniacal power that the world hasn't seen since. Had Kinski made comedies, they would have been eternally destroyed by his daughter's revelations. But, horrifyingly, the films he made with Herzog survive. Even worse, the evil within them has become more genuine, retroactively authenticated by the depravity of their lead actor. There is a difference between playing a role involving incest and actually living it out as Kinski has been accused of doing. It is the difference between being an artist and being a criminal. \n \n It had always been clear to enthralled audiences, as they watched Kinski dance on the precipice of lunacy, that they wouldn't be able to stand the man for even five minutes in real life. His daughter, however, was left at the mercy of this crazy genius. Three years ago, her younger sister Nastassja Kinski said in an interview: \"He hurt us so badly. It is good that some people don't remain in this world for longer.\" Her sister Pola has now provided the background for that verdict. He was probably the monstrous psychopath that we always thought he was. In the Friday edition of the tabloid Bild, Nastassja describes her sister as a \"hero\" for coming forward with the accusations. \n \n Horribly Unbearable \n \n Kinski didn't even try to hide his mindset. His comments in a 1977 talk show -- displaying as always his disregard for God, the world and societal morals -- are legendary. \"Here, you land in prison for sleeping with a 12-year-old girl; in the Orient, they marry at age 11. Isn't that absurd?\" he said to approving laughter from the audience. \n \n It is exactly this deification that Pola Kinski has courageously contradicted. It is courageous because she is not only taking on her father, but also his adoring fans. Are we accomplices because we interpreted his unveiled criminal cravings as art? \n \n For \"My Best Fiend,\" Herzog traveled to sites where the movies he made with Kinski were filmed. He presented outtakes and archival material and showed the physical and psychological violence his lead actor exhibited on the set. \"He would scream at me for hours, two inches away from my face,\" Herzog says in the film. But he also noted that \"he was also very loving with me then and would kiss me and hold me and could also be very emotional and very moving.\" Herzog reached the conclusion that working with insanity had made him crazy -- or complicit -- as well. His therapeutic documentary ends with the weak claim that their joint derangement must have converged to create great art. \n \n \"My Best Fiend\" ends with a conciliatory scene of unexpected gentleness -- a scene that, in light of the new revelations, is horribly unbearable. An enthralled, laughing Kinski is playing with a butterfly that is fluttering about. Herzog says with feeling: \"Then I see him with a butterfly, softly, delicately. The little creature doesn't want to leave him, and is so unafraid. Sometimes it seems to me that Klaus himself turns into a butterfly. Everything that weighed on us is gone. And even though my mind revolts against it, something deep inside tells me this is the way I'd like to keep him in my memory.\" \n \n That, however, is no longer possible. And perhaps it's better that way.",

    "document": "On Independence Day, celebrations across the United States depend on China. \n \n The sparklers, bottle rockets and Roman candles you\u2019ll be using this Fourth of July almost certainly came from there. So did the professional-grade pyrotechnics that\u2019ll be launched above the Washington Monument on Friday night. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset \n \n It\u2019s a quirky exception to \u201cBuy American\u201d sentiments that are otherwise going strong and picking up steam in Washington and corporate America, especially around patriotic events. \n \n (PHOTOS: 15 historic Independence Day events) \n \n After all, Congress passed a law this year requiring flags flown by the U.S. military to be made in America. Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, scrambled ahead of this year\u2019s Winter Olympics in Sochi to make sure that Team USA\u2019s uniforms were all manufactured in the United States. And first lady Michelle Obama used U.S.-grown iris and quince blossoms at a state dinner for France in May, departing from the White House\u2019s typical practice of using imported flowers. \n \n But fireworks? No change there. Over the past 35 years, China has grabbed nearly the entire U.S. market \u2014 with 98 to 99 percent of what consumers will buy this year being made there, as well as 75 percent of the \u201cdisplay\u201d fireworks, which are used in big, public shows. \n \n Fireworks are a big business, with $675 million in sales just to consumers who will shoot off their own products expected this year, said Julie Heckman, the American Pyrotechnics Association\u2019s executive director. Chinese imports are necessary, she said, because it\u2019s \u201cvery, very labor-intensive to make fireworks. Basically everything is still made by hand.\u201d \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Why the Civil Rights Act couldn't pass today) \n \n Environmental and safety regulations in the United States, she said, would force domestically made versions of the same fireworks to retail for 10 times as much as the Chinese imports, she estimated. \n \n The industry\u2019s shift to Chinese production came about shortly after the United States and China reestablished trade ties in 1979. By the early 1990s, the country was generating more than $60 million in annual sales from pyrotechnic exports to the United States. By 2013, the United States was importing $213 million worth of fireworks \u2014 virtually all from China. \n \n The trend won\u2019t be changing anytime soon, fireworks industry experts said. \n \n Thailand accounts for some of the small fraction of fireworks used in the United States that weren\u2019t made in China, as do U.S. companies and European manufacturers of larger pyrotechnics used in professional shows, according to John Rogers, executive director of the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory, which conducts safety inspections before fireworks are shipped from China to U.S. buyers. \n \n (Also on POLITICO: Reforming the VA one step at a time) \n \n In the 1980s and early 1990s, Rogers said, the Chinese imports fell short of U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and Department of Transportation safety standards, largely because manufacturers there lacked quality control procedures and \u201cbecause there was nobody really checking \u2014 nobody was monitoring to make sure they were meeting U.S. manufacturing and safety standards.\u201d \n \n The good news, Rogers said, is that the quality of China\u2019s fireworks is improving. Starting in 1994, the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory, which counts nearly all major U.S. fireworks importers among its clients, started inspecting tens of thousands of shipments each year before they left China. \n \n The group also imposed its own standards, such as a rule intended to prevent sparklers\u2019 particles from falling onto children\u2019s clothing and starting fires, Rogers said. \n \n U.S. fireworks importers typically make several trips to China each year, and manufacturers there have retooled their production to meet U.S. standards, Heckman said. \n \n She acknowledged that China has earned a \u201cbad rep\u201d over imported tires, agricultural products and more, but said: \u201cIn the fireworks industry, it\u2019s very different. The industry has worked hand in hand with China, and many of these relationships go back four, five, six generations, much like the generational family businesses in the United States.\u201d ||||| When you look up at those Fourth of July fireworks, say hooray for the red and white \u2014 but give a special cheer for the blue. \n \n \"People have been trying to make a good blue for 500 years, and they haven't quite perfected it,\" John Conkling, a chemistry professor emeritus from Washington College in Maryland, told NBC News. \"Purples we're getting good at. Pinks are decent. But blues are a big challenge.\" \n \n Sign up for Science news delivered to your inbox \n \n Conkling should know: He literally wrote the book on the chemistry of pyrotechnics, and is featured in a new video on the subject from the American Chemical Society. The way Conkling sees it, scientists still have a lot to learn about the science of fireworks, thousands of years after the Chinese invented them. \n \n Even today, the Chinese are setting the pace in the global fireworks industry. \"More and more of the product these days is made in China, so if there was a lot of research and development, it'd be going on in China,\" Conkling said. \n \n But there's still something to be said for American know-how: Every year, specialty fireworks manufacturers in the United States come up with fresh twists \u2014 with a big assist from the U.S. Army. \n \n \"Pyrotechnics is one leg of a four-legged stool in the energetics field,\" said James Wejsa, chief of the pyrotechnics technology and prototyping division at the Army's Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey. \"We also have the propellants, the explosives and the warheads. The military is the one who really drives the technology in this area, and usually what you have are spin-offs in the commercial sector.\" \n \n 'Greener' fireworks from the Army \n \n For example, Picatinny has been working on more environmentally friendly ingredients for the pyrotechnics that produce colored signals as a means of non-verbal communication on the battlefield. \n \n \"Getting new dyes and new ways to burn the formulations with different fuels is a challenge,\" Wejsa said. \"The last thing you want is to have a soldier saying, 'Is that red smoke or violet smoke?' It could be the difference between 'shoot me' and 'don't shoot me,' you know what I'm saying?\" \n \n It turns out that the new formulations just might improve your neighborhood Fourth of July fireworks show as well. The Army has been working on a spin-off with Fireworks by Grucci, one of the biggest companies in the business. \n \n \"These formulations burn brighter and they burn clearer because there's less smoke,\" Wejsa said. \"It's almost like going to high definition, because you don't have the smoke obscuring the color.\" \n \n Wejsa and his team are making fireworks \"greener\" in more ways than one: They've developed a technique to produce a bright green flare using boron carbide rather than toxic barium compounds, a smoke grenade that emits less hazardous smoke, timing fuses and other pyrotechnics that don't leave potentially toxic perchlorate residues, and explosive primers that don't use lead. \n \n \"Our goal is to spin this off to commercial applications,\" Wejsa said. \n \n The future of fireworks \n \n So what's next? \"The newest thing has been to try to perfect colors that normally people don't see in fireworks,\" Conkling said. Like a bright true blue, or really good orange. \n \n \"All the blues we see now have a copper compound that's at the heart of the reaction,\" Conkling explained. \"The battle you're fighting here is that colored fireworks are brightest at high temperatures, but the copper emitter is not stable at high temperatures. So you have to play a game of 'The Price Is Right.'\" \n \n To produce an especially orange blast, chemists try blending run-of-the-mill sodium yellow-orange with red, but the job requires a lot of experimentation. The resulting recipes are closely held. \"The old U.S. fireworks makers used to say there were some formulas they wouldn't even tell their grandmothers,\" Conkling said. \n \n NBC News file \n \n Another frontier for fireworks has to do with creating shapes in the sky. \"It's common to see the heart pattern, the five-pointed star, multiple rings,\" Conkling said. \"The logical extension of that would be letters, and being able to orient the letter up in the sky so you could spell out 'NBC' or something like that.\" \n \n Fireworks by Grucci is already experimenting with a couple of technologies called PixelBurst and SkyEtching to create complicated patterns, letters and numbers. The technique was used for the countdown in Grucci's Dubai New Year's Eve display \u2014 and although the numbers are a bit hard to read, Conking is confident pyrotechnicians will work out the bugs. \"It isn't like putting a man on the moon to do that,\" he said. \n \n Will your fireworks be rained out? A guide for East Coasters \n \n Besides the military, theme parks are the main drivers for innovation in fireworks displays \u2014 and sometimes it's not strictly about the fireworks. For example, the \"Frozen\" spectacular that's due to make its debut at Disney's Hollywood Studios in Florida this week will supplement the evening sky show with a video projection of social-media \"selfies\" submitted by parkgoers during the day. \n \n When Conkling attends the Fourth of July festivities with his four grandchildren in Chestertown, Maryland, he'll be watching for the blues in the red-white-and-blue. But like most fans of the Fourth, he recognizes that a fireworks display isn't just a chemistry experiment. The winning formula also requires a healthy dose of flag-waving \u2014 and a flair for drama. \n \n \"One thing I like is a well-paced show,\" he told NBC News. \"There should be no dead spots in it, and there should be some variety in it. It's not just the same thing over and over again.\" \n \n IN-DEPTH \n \n First published July 4 2014, 8:45 AM",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Ah, Independence Day fireworks: What could be more ... Chinese? Yep, despite strong \"Buy American\" sentiments in other fields (the US military must fly made-in-America flags, for example), China still manufactures at least 98% of consumer fireworks and 75% of \"display\" fireworks (for big shows) sold in America, Politico reports. The US needs them because fireworks production is \"very, very labor-intensive,\" says a pyrotechnics expert. \"Basically everything is still made by hand.\" What's more, she says, US safety and environmental regulations would make home-made fireworks about 10 times costlier for consumers. China began grabbing the US fireworks market after Washington reestablished trade ties in 1979; by last year, the US was importing $213 million in fireworks, nearly all from China. Federal authorities grew alarmed in the 1980s and early 1990s over the lack of safety standards in Chinese fireworks, but now the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory has imposed stricter rules and says it inspects fireworks shipments before they leave China.

He is also charged with attempted murder on allegations he shot at Toor's pregnant wife, who wasn't injured. Wang has pleaded not guilty, and he has insisted he is competent and doesn't need medication. \n \n Authorities say the shooting appeared to stem from a 2008 workplace dispute Wang had with Toor and other doctors when they worked together at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in New York City. Wang was fired from the medical center that year after a series of confrontations with Toor and other colleagues. \n \n Wang represented himself in the case until a judge ruled him incompetent last year and assigned a public defender. In November, New Haven Superior Court Judge Thomas O'Keefe Jr. ruled that state officials could forcibly medicate Wang to make him competent to stand trial and that doing so would not violate Wang's constitutional rights or the 2003 U.S. Supreme Court ruling. O'Keefe's decision was put on hold pending the Supreme Court appeal. \n \n A main issue in the appeal was whether prosecutors showed that it was \"substantially likely\" that forcing medication on Wang would restore him to competency. The \"substantially likely\" standard was set \u2014 but not specifically defined \u2014 in 2003 by the U.S. Supreme Court, which said the government can force medication on mentally ill criminal defendants only in the rarest of circumstances and only if certain conditions are met. \n \n The Connecticut Supreme Court said state prosecutors met those conditions and concluded that it was substantially likely that Wang would be restored to competency with medication. State justices relied on the testimony of a state psychiatrist, who said the chances of success in restoring Wang to competency with recommended medications was in a percentage range from the mid-50s to 70. \n \n Wang's public defender on the appeal, Mark Rademacher, argued that a projected success rate of mid-50s to 70 percent did not make it \"substantially likely\" that Wang would be restored to competency. The Supreme Court disagreed and defined \"substantially likely\" as \"more likely than not, or a greater than 50 percent probability.\" \n \n \"They just set the bar too low before they can violently restrain a patient, knock him out with a sedative and inject him with medication,\" Rademacher said Tuesday. \"It's an extremely serious thing to do and shouldn't be taken lightly.\" \n \n Rademacher said he will be deciding whether to appeal the state Supreme Court ruling to a federal court, possibly the U.S. Supreme Court. \n \n Prosecutor Nancy Walker has said the ruling by O'Keefe in November did not violate Wang's rights or the U.S. Supreme Court restrictions. She said his case is based on the sound medical advice of experts and is one of the rare instances where forced medication is allowed.",

As laid out in a 2003 US Supreme Court ruling, prosecutors had to show it was \"substantially likely\" the medication would make Wang competent to stand trial. A state psychiatrist testified there was a 50% to 70% chance of that happening. While Wang's public defender, Mark Rademacher, argues that doesn't meet the threshold, the state Supreme Court ruled 7-0 that anything greater than 50% constitutes \"substantially likely.\" The court also ruled there wasn't a \"less-intrusive option\" to forcibly medicating Wang and that he was unlikely to have side effects from the medication, CBS Connecticut reports.

    "document": "UPDATES with NFL\u2019s reaction below, then President Obama\u2019s: \n \n \u201cWe appreciate Senator Sweeney\u2019s interest, but officiating controversies have always been a part of sport,\u201d said NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy. \u201cOur staff, including Commissioner [Roger] Goodell, has been in negotiations with the referees union for the past week. We hope to reach agreement as soon as possible.\u201d \n \n President Obama this afternoon was asked about the game\u2019s ending: \n \n \u201cTerrible,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve been saying for months, we\u2019ve gotta get our refs back.\u201d \n \n There has been vociferous negative reaction nationwide to the controversial ending to the Monday Night Football game between Green Bay and Seattle \u2013 especially among bettors: professional sports bettor R.J. Bell estimates that the \u201chouse,\u201d which was stuck with twice as much money bet on the Packers, collected an extra $150 million overall because the Packers lost against the point spread instead of the Seahawks. \n \n But Jersey always like to step things up a notch in their own way \u2013 and has done so again. \n \n State Senate President Stephen Sweeney, D-Gloucester County, whose beloved Packers came out on the wrong end of a bad call in the game\u2019s final play, on Tuesday announced that he isn\u2019t going to take it lying down. \n \n Sweeney noted to the Associated Press that the NFL is the same league that has sued New Jersey to stop sports betting for a perceived threat to the integrity of the game. \n \n So here\u2019s Sweeney\u2019s press release in response to the botched finish: \n \n \u201cNew Jersey state Senate President Stephen Sweeney today said he plans to introduce legislation prohibiting the playing of professional sporting events with replacement officials, citing the potential for increased injury by inexperienced referees who cannot control a game. \n \n \u201cThis past weekend in the NFL has not only made a mockery of a great sport, but shined a very bright light on how important fully trained and professional officiating is to player safety,\u201d said Sweeney. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t allow a factory or construction site to operate without fully trained supervisors on hand to ensure the safety of employees. Why should we do anything differently when the job site is a playing field?\u201d \n \n Sweeney said that the litany of missed calls or blatantly miscalled penalties over the first three weeks of the National Football League (NFL) season has proven the replacement officials do not have the ability to control a game in a highly physical sport where players get injured on routine plays even under the most well-trained of referees. \n \n Sweeney said that replacement officials also lower the quality of play, devaluing the often large investments fans have made in tickets. \n \n \u201cWhether the sport is football, soccer or baseball, when referees don\u2019t know how to properly enforce the rules, there is a real chance for unnecessary and serious injury,\u201d said Sweeney. \u201cIf the NFL insists on putting replacement officials on the field, putting players at risk, then the state shouldn\u2019t be playing a part in that.\u201d \n \n Comments \n \n comments ||||| Monday night's controversial touchdown call that gave the Seattle Seahawks a 14-12 victory over the Green Bay Packers had an immediate impact for gamblers. \n \n If the Hail Mary pass by Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson would have been ruled an interception by Packers safety M.D. Jennings, Green Bay -- 3\u00bd point favorites -- would have won by five, covering the spread. \n \n Instead, the replacement officials' call that Seahawks wide receiver Golden Tate had possession shifted all those who bet on the Packers to those who took the underdog Seahawks. \n \n \"Most of the customers in the sportsbook were not happy with the final call,\" said John Avello, director of the race and sportsbook at the Wynn in Las Vegas. \"The shift was 100 percent. After the (Seahawks) score, all bets were reversed.\" \n \n Avello's best guess as to how much money was shifted worldwide on the call? $150 million in total bets worldwide. \n \n Jeff Sherman, assistant director of the race and sportsbook at the Las Vegas Hotel, says he estimates that the game shifted $15 million in Nevada alone and also concurs with Avello that the worldwide number, including offshore sportsbooks and in Europe, is worth about 10 times more. \n \n Those who take bets online estimated the shift in money was even greater. \n \n Mike Perry, spokesman for betting site Sportsbook.ag, told ESPN.com his estimate in the money swing on the call at the end of the game is closer to between $200 million and $250 million. \n \n Perry said that 70 to 80 percent of the money on his site was put on the Packers, which is in line with the percentage bet in Vegas. At Mandalay Bay, the sportsbook took in about $500,000 in total bets, with about 85 percent of the money on the Packers. \n \n Oddsmaker Danny Sheridan, who sets the lines for USA Today, had the highest estimate of those surveyed by ESPN.com. Sheridan said Tuesday morning that he believes that $1 billion in total money changed hands with the touchdown call. \n \n While there has been no way to handicap the exact part that replacement officials play in spreads, Avello says that it's not the first time this year that spreads have been altered by bad calls. \n \n \"It's the first call that has directly affected the outcome, but there have been many that have affected the outcome or the spread directly,\" he said. \n \n The call didn't just have an immediate impact on gamblers, it also impacted the Packers' Super Bowl odds. After Monday night's game, the Las Vegas Hotel has changed the odds for the Packers to win the Super Bowl from 7-1 Monday to 9-1 Tuesday.",

The NFL brushed aside Sweeney's concerns, saying that \"officiating controversies have always been a part of the sport.\" But judging by the reaction so far, that's not likely to appease anyone. ESPN tweeted that the NFL offices have gotten more than 70,000 voicemails regarding the botched call.

    "document": "Dannemora \n \n A violent melee between two factions of inmates broke out in a recreation yard at Clinton Correction Facility five days before two inmates on an \"honor block\" used tools to cut their way out of the maximum security prison. \n \n The fight took place June 1 when two groups of inmates \u2014 some of whom were Muslim and others who were suspected members of the Bloods gang \u2014 began fighting, according to a person briefed on the case. \n \n Correction officers in two towers overlooking the yard fired canisters of chemical agents into the middle of the fight, which ended in less than a minute, the person said. An inmate suffered a broken leg. Part of the prison was locked down the next day, four days before the escape, but only the yard and two cellblocks were searched, rather than the entire prison, which houses about 3,000 inmates. Five weapons were found during the searches. \n \n A person close to the case said some correction officers are questioning whether a request to lock down and search the entire facility was rebuffed by Department of Corrections and Community Supervision headquarters in Albany. \n \n A spokesperson for DOCCS on Tuesday said no information about the operations at the prison is being released while the investigation into the escape, and the search for the escaped inmates, continues. \n \n The two inmates, Richard Matt, 48, and David Sweat, 34, used a small electrical saw, powered by extension cords, and a sledgehammer to cut and pound their way to freedom from inside the prison not far from the Canadian border. \n \n A law enforcement source briefed on the case said State Police investigators are probing whether the inmates may have received the small hand-held saw and other tools from a female civilian employee who had developed a relationship with Matt. The items would have been smuggled into the prison. \n \n Employees at state prisons are not required to pass through metal detectors when they enter the facilities, although bags and purses are supposed to be searched. There is a size limit on the bags that employees carry into the facilities, but it is rarely enforced, according to an official with the state DOCCS. \n \n Matt and Sweat used the saw and hand-held blades to cut holes through metal walls in the back of their adjacent cells on an \"honor block\" tier. The holes they cut led to a cavernous utility bowel inside the prison where the men spliced an electrical cord into a light fixture to power the saw they then used to cut a large hole in a 24-inch steam pipe that led to a sewer outside the prison, said the source, who is not authorized to comment publicly on the case. They cut their way into the pipe because climbing through it was the only way to get past the outer prison wall, the source said. \n \n As a massive manhunt continues in the heavily forested areas around the prison in Dannemora, the investigation has zeroed in on a female employee who worked for several years in a prison tailor shop with Matt and Sweat. Published reports said investigators have visited the woman's home. A person close to the case said investigators are also examining whether the employee or someone else may have given Matt access to a cellphone. Correction officers briefed on the case said police believe the escapees had arranged with someone to pick them up a block from the prison, but that their alleged accomplice backed out. \n \n When they climbed out of a sewer hole near the prison around midnight Friday, they were on foot and the initial search focused on a tight radius in the area of the prison. \n \n More Information \n \n Prison employees, including correction officers, support staff and administrators, are prohibited from having personal relationships with inmates. \n \n The manhole covers are locked from the inside to prevent them from being stolen. But the person briefed on the case said the inmates apparently used a 20-pound sledgehammer to break the cover's lock. It's unclear how they obtained the sledgehammer. The men carried their tools into the bowels of the prison in a guitar case that they kept in one of their cells. Two witnesses reported seeing two men in the back yard of a house just after midnight Friday, including one who was carrying a guitar case. The men were discovered missing from their cells at 5:30 a.m. Saturday. \n \n Being on an honor block gave the inmates more liberties, including the ability to cook and visit other inmates' cells at times. \n \n The looser restrictions on the honor block tier may have been a factor in their meticulous escape plan. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who visited the prison Saturday, questioned how other inmates on the tier could not have heard the sawing, suggesting sarcastically they must be \"heavy sleepers.\" \n \n Matt and Sweat, both of whom were convicted of murder, had piled clothing and other items under their bed linens to make it appear they were sleeping, state officials said. \n \n The FBI is assisting in the search, and a law enforcement source said authorities believe the men, with their escape plan altered, could still be within a five- or 10-mile radius of the prison. The inmates' assignment on the honor block allowed them to wear and keep regular clothing other than their prison uniforms. The person briefed on the case said the green prison uniforms were found left behind. \n \n blyons@timesunion.com \u2022 518-454-5547 \u2022 @blyonswriter ||||| The only son of convicted murderer and prison escapee Richard W. Matt finds it hard to believe authorities failed to take greater precautions in making sure his father remained behind bars. \n \n \u201cYou know he has escaped before. He has a genius IQ. I can\u2019t believe they let this happen,\u201d said 23-year-old Nicholas Harris, who recalled his father bragging to him and his mother about how he had attempted to escape from a Mexican prison and ended up being shot. \n \n \u201cHe said he made it up to the roof of the prison and got shot in the shoulder. He pulled down his shirt and showed us the bullet wound. This guy has bullet holes on his body. He\u2019s been shot like nine times. It\u2019s like they can\u2019t kill him. He showed me the scars on his forearms from another time he escaped,\u201d Harris said Monday during an interview outside his family\u2019s Southtowns residence, where he cares for his disabled mother. \n \n ----- \n \n Photo gallery: Where WNY\u2019s notorious criminals are locked up \n \n ----- \n \n As a frantic, nationwide manhunt was underway Monday after Matt and convicted cop killer David P. Sweat escaped from Clinton Correctional Facility in the Adirondacks, Harris said he hopes the father that he knows just well enough to be afraid of does not make his way to this end of New York State. \n \n Harris says the family stories about his father, who also has a daughter, are frightening. \n \n \u201cMy father broke into my mother\u2019s house in Tonawanda and beat her,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI was an infant when it happened.\u201d \n \n Police records substantiate that attack. \n \n Matt, according to his son, seemed doomed from the start to be on the wrong side of the law. \n \n \u201cHe was left as an infant in a car. Everybody is born innocent, but he was raised around crime. Then he went into foster care,\u201d Harris said. \n \n A Buffalo police source said that Matt\u2019s father was frequently arrested decades ago in the Broadway-Fillmore neighborhood. \n \n \u201cI arrested him at different times and I can tell you the father was a piece of garbage,\u201d the police source said. \n \n In the City of Tonawanda, where Matt and his older brother, Robert, ended up being raised in foster care, a resident on the block where they lived also said that Matt\u2019s father was often in trouble with the law and that was why the boys ended up in foster care placement. \n \n Matt\u2019s brother and father are deceased, Harris and acquaintances of the family said. \n \n As for Harris\u2019 early recollections of his father, he says they are vague. Richard Matt was in and out of prison. But Harris says he has clear memories of meeting his father several years ago at the Niagara County Jail in Lockport. \n \n \u201cHe makes an impression that lingers with you,\u201d said Harris, who is on a leave of absence from college to care for his mother. \u201cMy father has always wanted to have a relationship with me.\u201d \n \n And so after Matt was brought back here in 2007 from Mexico, where he had been arrested years earlier and jailed without a trial for killing a man in a barroom fight, Harris visited his father. That\u2019s when Matt regaled his then-teenage son with the story of his attempted Mexican jailbreak, Harris said. \n \n Harris also got a look at the scars on his father\u2019s forearms from a 1986 escape at the Erie County Correctional Facility in Alden. \n \n Showing an old snapshot of his father to a Buffalo News reporter, Harris pointed to a forearm in the photograph and said, \u201cLook, you can see the scars.\u201d \n \n Matt had scaled a correctional facility wall and a gate topped with razor wire, slicing up his arms, for what amounted to five days of freedom before he was caught in his brother\u2019s City of Tonawanda apartment. \n \n During the jailhouse meeting with his father, Harris said Matt appeared \u201cweighed down\u201d from years of being in and out of jail. And there was no end in sight to Matt\u2019s incarceration. A Niagara County jury in 2008 convicted him of abducting, beating, torturing, murdering and dismembering William L. Rickerson, 76, in December 1997. Matt had avoided a criminal trial at that time by fleeing to Mexico, only to be arrested there in 1998 for the fatal barroom fight. \n \n Harris said that although he wrote a letter to his father after their only visit, he decided that a relationship was not for him. \n \n \u201cI was raised by a stepfather,\u201d he said. \u201cI was mature enough at that age to know I already had a father figure. I decided a relationship would not be healthy.\u201d \n \n But not everything Harris knows about his biological father, four years younger than his mother, troubles him. Perhaps the only time the young, dark-haired man with an uncanny resemblance to Matt smiled was in telling how Matt romantically pursued his mother, Vee Marie Harris. \n \n \u201cMy mother grew up in Tonawanda and knew him from when he was a kid. He had a crush on my mother and would say to her, \u2018If I were older, would you be my girl?\u2019 \u201d Harris said. \u201cHe\u2019d lower his head and kick his foot against the ground when he asked. She would tell him he was so young. But then she met him later when he was in his 20s and he was a good-looking guy. They started dating and she got pregnant with me.\u201d \n \n Harris says he learned of his father\u2019s escape from the state prison over the weekend when a large contingent of New York State Police and Homeland Security officials arrived at his family\u2019s home in Angola. \n \n Matt, 49, and Sweat, 35, convicted of killing a Broome County sheriff\u2019s deputy in 2002, were reportedly last seen in the maximum security prison, situated not far from the Canadian border, at 10:30 p.m. Friday. They were unaccounted for during a 5:30 a.m. bed check on Saturday. Authorities determined that the two inmates, who were in the honor section of the prison, had used power tools to cut through steel pipes to make their escape. \n \n State police, Harris said, asked him and his 53-year-old mother to contact them if they learn anything about Matt\u2019s whereabouts. \n \n \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it when the State Police and Homeland Security showed up. I thought I had done something wrong and they were coming for me,\u201d Harris said of his initial shock at having so many members of law enforcement at his home. \n \n Throughout the weekend, Harris said, he watched television footage of Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo checking the escape route his father and Sweat took inside Clinton Correctional Facility. \n \n \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. \n \n Harris said he has no idea what his father\u2019s intentions are, but points out that his mother is ill and does not need any more heartache. \n \n And while he doubts his father would surrender, Harris said, \u201cI\u2019m hoping for the best outcome for everyone involved.\u201d \n \n There is a $100,000 reward for information leading to the capture of Matt and Sweat. And as of late Monday, State Police continued to remind the public that the two men are \u201cvery dangerous individuals\u201d and any suspicious activity should be reported to 911 or (518) 563-3761. \n \n email: lmichel@buffnews.com ||||| The search for two convicted murderers who broke out of prison brought investigators Tuesday to a tiny town in upstate New York after a local resident reported seeing two men walking along a country road late Monday night. \n \n \u201cA report was called in by a citizen of two suspicious men walking down a very rural road in the southern part of our town in the middle of a driving rainstorm,\u201d Shaun Gillilland, the town supervisor in...",

Willsboro is about 35 miles from where Richard Matt and David Sweat busted out of the Clinton Correctional Facility. More details are filling in on the great escape, too. The leading theory is that a female employee of the prison who worked with the two men in its tailor shop smuggled in a small electrical saw and perhaps other tools such as a sledgehammer, reports the Albany Times Union.

    "document": "Want these election updates emailed to you right when they\u2019re published? Sign up here. \n \n The race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump has tightened. Clinton, whose lead over Trump exceeded 8 percentage points at her peak following the Democratic convention, is ahead by 4 or 5 percentage points today, according to our polls-only forecast. \n \n The tighter margins in the polls, which reflect a loss of support for Clinton along with a modest improvement for Trump, have come gradually over the past few weeks. The evidence of a tightening has become more widespread, however, and it\u2019s particularly clear in polls that surveyed the race just after the conventions and are retaking its temperature now. Fox News\u2019s national poll, for instance, had Clinton up by 9 points just after the conventions (in the version of the poll that included third-party candidates) and has her up by 2 points now. \n \n There isn\u2019t any guarantee that Trump will continue to gain ground. Over the course of the year, polls have oscillated between showing a dead heat at Trump\u2019s best moments and a lead of 8 to 10 percentage points for Clinton at her peaks. We\u2019re about halfway between those goal posts now. It\u2019s plausible that the recent shift reflects Clinton\u2019s convention bounce wearing off \u2014 reversion to the mean \u2014 as much as it does momentum for Trump per se. Most importantly, Clinton is still ahead, with a 74 percent chance of winning according to the polls-only model and a 70 percent chance according to polls-plus. \n \n But what if the race continues to tighten? I\u2019ve often heard Democrats express a belief that Clinton\u2019s position in the swing states will protect her in the Electoral College even if the race draws to a dead heat overall. But this is potentially mistaken. Although it\u2019s plausible that Clinton\u2019s superior field operation will eventually pay dividends, so far her swing state results have ebbed and flowed with her national numbers. \n \n Take Wisconsin, for example. At her peak, Clinton had a double-digit lead there, according to our polls-only forecast. By Wednesday morning, it had declined to an estimated 7 points, as a result of our model\u2019s trend line adjustment \u2014 which adjusts polls in all states based on shifts it detects in the race overall \u2014 along with data from the Ipsos 50-state tracking poll. \n \n We know that some readers don\u2019t like the trend line adjustment. But if anything, the model hadn\u2019t been aggressive enough. Two highly rated, traditional telephone polls of Wisconsin came out Wednesday, and they showed Clinton up by just 3 points and 5 points. The 3-point lead was in a poll from Marquette University, which had Clinton up by 13 points just after the Democratic National Convention. (As of Thursday morning, Clinton is projected to win by 5 points in Wisconsin, according to the polls-only model.) \n \n Usually, the trend line adjustment helps the model peg what forthcoming polls will look like in a state even if there haven\u2019t been many of them recently. When Clinton established a roughly 8-point lead nationally in August, for example, it figured we\u2019d see polls showing her with leads of 10 to 12 percentage points in some of her better swing states, such as Michigan and Colorado, along with leads of 5 to 6 percentage points in swing states that are just slightly redder than the country as a whole, such as Ohio and Florida. And that\u2019s pretty much what we saw, at least on average. Now that the race has tightened to 4 or 5 points nationally, the model expects to see narrower leads \u2014 along with some polls showing a tie or Trump slightly ahead in the more red-leaning swing states: \n \n ADJUSTED POLLING AVERAGE STATE AUG. 14 AUG. 31 Arizona +1.6 -3.9 Colorado +10.5 +6.1 Florida +6.3 +3.1 Georgia +0.7 -2.3 Iowa +5.0 +0.7 Michigan +11.8 +6.0 Minnesota +12.6 +7.7 Nevada +4.2 +0.8 New Hampshire +9.0 +4.2 North Carolina +5.5 +1.2 Ohio +6.4 +2.7 Pennsylvania +9.3 +4.8 Virginia +9.1 +7.1 Wisconsin +12.6 +4.8 Clinton\u2019s projected leads have shrunk in swing states \n \n Keep in mind that these numbers are self-correcting. For instance, the model expects new Ohio polls to show Clinton ahead by 2 or 3 percentage points, provided they don\u2019t have a strong Trump-leaning or Clinton-leaning house effect. If new surveys deviate significantly from that range, the model will adjust itself accordingly. But usually this method gets things about right. Swing states are swing states for a reason \u2014 they closely follow the overall national trend. \n \n The other thing to notice about Clinton\u2019s swing state polls is that they aren\u2019t especially strong (or weak) relative to her national polls. At her post-convention peak, Clinton\u2019s path of least resistance to 270 electoral votes appeared to run through a set of states that included Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and New Hampshire, among others. But in Pennsylvania, the most recent polls have Clinton ahead by margins ranging from 3 to 8 percentage points \u2014 perfectly fine, but not that different from her national numbers. We haven\u2019t gotten much data recently from New Hampshire, but it can be swingy, and the most recent numbers from the Ipsos poll (caveat: very small sample size) showed Trump ahead. We did get some high-quality polls from Wisconsin, and, as I mentioned, they weren\u2019t that good for Clinton. \n \n Overall, Clinton\u2019s leads in the tipping-point states \u2014 the ones most likely to determine the Electoral College winner in a close election \u2014 average about 4 percentage points, close to her numbers in national polls. \n \n With a tighter race, the model\u2019s expectations for Clinton are lower. A new poll showing her up by 5 or 6 points in Florida or Ohio \u2014 which would have been a ho-hum result a few weeks ago \u2014 could be a terrific one for her today, depending on the pollster. ||||| The plan to get to 270 electoral votes remains unclear. The battleground state deployment plan is a work in progress. Money from big donors is slowing to a trickle. And aides are confused about who\u2019s calling the shots. \n \n Donald Trump\u2019s campaign is teetering, threatening to collapse under the weight of a candidate whose personality outweighs his political skill. And now, with 22 days until the start of early voting, the GOP nominee is running short on his most precious commodity: time. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Late last week, with Labor Day and the final stretch of the 2016 campaign approaching, Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met with Republican National Committee brass \u2014 including chief of staff Katie Walsh and political director Chris Carr \u2014 in New York City. Kushner, who has in many respects assumed the role of campaign manager, asked a series of direct questions to the GOP officials \u2014 all surrounding the troubles the party was having in deploying field staffers, opening up swing-state headquarters, and establishing field offices in battlegrounds that will decide the election. \n \n Those present for the meeting, and those briefed on it, insisted there were no fireworks, no drag-out fights. But they said Kushner\u2019s questions reflected a growing realization within Trump\u2019s team that for all the party\u2019s talk about implementing a major swing-state deployment plan, it hasn\u2019t yet materialized. \n \n For weeks, Republican officials and operatives have groused about a dearth of campaign infrastructure in battlegrounds across the country \u2014 a state of affairs that could have an impact on GOP candidates up and down the ballot. But like many aspects of the Trump campaign, the deployment plan has been wracked by confusion, false starts and a lack of quick decision-making. On Aug. 18, Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman, came to Trump\u2019s Alexandria, Virginia, headquarters for a day of meetings. He left ready to finalize a series of decisions. \n \n But the next morning, Manafort, under withering scrutiny surrounding his work overseas, abruptly quit. His departure created a chain reaction, delaying the talks for days on end. By late August, finger-pointing had begun: In interviews, a Trump aide accused the RNC of slow-walking the process, while RNC officials blamed the lag on dysfunction within the campaign. \n \n Trump\u2019s son Eric, who has expressed impatience to party officials about progress being made in battleground states, on Monday made a pilgrimage to RNC headquarters in hopes of expediting the delayed field programs. \n \n The RNC shrugged off any talk of tension with the Trump campaign. \u201cThe RNC and the Trump campaign have a good working relationship,\u201d said Lindsay Walters, a committee spokeswoman. \u201cWe are coordinating on all fronts as we work towards victory in November.\u201d \n \n The absence of a clear plan has spread to something even more fundamental \u2014 the campaign\u2019s path to 270 electoral votes. \n \n In mid-August, Trump\u2019s campaign team gathered with RNC officials at the candidate\u2019s Washington, D.C.-area office to discuss the swing-state map and a deployment plan that would make their difficult Electoral College math work. \n \n According to three people present, Trump\u2019s chief pollster, Tony Fabrizio, laid out a path that required the team to divide states into four tiers \u2014 with Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania sitting in Tier One. In the next were Arizona and North Carolina, which Mitt Romney carried but where Democrats are hoping to compete this time around. There were also Nevada and Iowa, which Democrats won in 2012 but where Trump is running competitively. \n \n The third tier included traditionally conservative states \u2014 Georgia, Missouri and Indiana \u2014 that Trump would need to keep an eye on. In the final tier were a half-dozen states, including Michigan, Virginia and New Hampshire, that President Barack Obama won four years ago. Whether to invest resources into those states would depend on costs, the strength of Trump\u2019s campaign in each of those states and an autumn assessment of the potential for a win. \n \n To those present, the plan was persuasive \u2014 and seemed to offer a coherent blueprint for the campaign to allocate resources. Yet, two weeks later and 20 days from the start of early voting, it\u2019s not clear the plan is being implemented. In recent days, Trump has campaigned in Mississippi and Washington state \u2014 neither of which are seen as remotely competitive. \n \n Making matters tough for Trump has been the ongoing reluctance of the party\u2019s biggest contributors to open their wallets. In some cases, they are expressing profound misgivings about the Republican nominee. Last month, during a gathering of House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s donor network in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Annie Dickerson, a Republican giver who also serves as top adviser to GOP megadonor and Trump critic Paul Singer, spoke up. During one panel discussion, discussion turned to an often-asked question in Republican circles: Whether not backing Trump would ultimately lead to the election of Hillary Clinton \u2014 and regret. \n \n That\u2019s when Dickerson chimed in: Trump, she said, has to be more accountable for himself. For Trump to blame everyone from the media to major donors to the establishment meant that he wasn\u2019t placing the right amount of responsibility on himself, she said. \n \n The billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch also have refused to come around. After the Republican National Convention, the Kochs invited their friends and allies to a retreat in Colorado Springs, Colorado. There, Doug Deason, the son of Texas billionaire Darwin Deason, tried to persuade Charles Koch to have a meeting with the nominee. In an interview, Deason recalled telling Koch that he could influence Trump\u2019s policies. But Koch was having none of it. His response: \u201cI just don\u2019t see the upside.\u201d \n \n The antipathy has had far-reaching consequences. More than a month after Trump was nominated in Cleveland, the committee tasked with funding the convention remains in debt, according to three sources briefed on its finances. Organizers struggled to raise cash from major contributors and companies, many of them leery of Trump\u2019s candidacy. (In July, just days before the start of the convention, the committee sent a letter to Republican megadonor Sheldon Adelson pleading to him for a $6 million infusion.) \n \n Some Republicans believe the party\u2019s most prominent contributors have simply moved on and will focus their remaining giving on competitive House and Senate races. \n \n \u201cOverwhelmingly the donors that I talk to are focused on protecting the House and saving the majority in the Senate,\u201d said Spencer Zwick, a Ryan political adviser who is one of the most prominent fundraisers in Republican politics. \n \n Not all is lost. As the campaign enters its final months, some things have improved \u2014 perhaps most notably, Trump\u2019s temperament and ability to stick to the script. During an August fundraising stop in Texas, Trump held forth before donors at a luncheon in Fort Worth, and vowed to stick with his new, more-on-message approach. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s turned the corner. He\u2019s sharpened the message and staying on message. He\u2019s not attacking Republicans and minorities, and he\u2019s letting the media focus on Clinton and her problems,\u201d said Deason, who was present at the Texas fundraiser. \n \n Recent swing state and national polling has shown Trump closing the gap with Clinton, who\u2019s endured days of negative headlines surrounding her email practices and her family\u2019s foundation. \n \n \u201cThe campaign has made tremendous strides over the last several weeks,\u201d said Jason Miller, a Trump spokesman. \u201cMr. Trump is working harder than ever, we\u2019re seeing greater crowds than ever before. Crooked Hillary Clinton continues to be a walking ethics nightmare to the extent she bothers to show up on the campaign trail at all. Additionally, it has been 271 days since Hillary Clinton held a press conference.\u201d \n \n Other improvements are also in the works. Following a multitude of on-air slip-ups from Trump television surrogates that resulted in a series of embarrassing headlines, some advisers \u2014 which, according to one source included former House Speaker Newt Gingrich \u2014 urged the campaign to alter the process for determining who is allowed to represent the campaign on TV news programs. Greater control of surrogates, they concluded, was a must \u2014 and freelancing simply couldn\u2019t happen anymore. \n \n On Wednesday evening, Bryan Lanza, a Trump press aide who oversees the surrogate operation, sent an email to staff informing them that changes were coming. \n \n \u201cWe are having too many issues of surrogates booking their media hits independently,\u201d Lanza wrote, adding that surrogates now needed to contact him before going on air. \u201cI will take care of all your booking needs. PLEASE DO NOT BOOK ON YOUR OWN ANYMORE.\u201d \n \n But with just over two months until the election, Trump\u2019s campaign remains transitory and unstable. Staffers describe a confusing work environment, with a constant lack of clarity about who\u2019s in charge. To some, it's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway and CEO Steve Bannon. Others say it's Kushner and other members of the Trump family. Others say that, in the end, it\u2019s Trump himself who\u2019s calling the shots. \n \n Even keeping track of who\u2019s working for the campaign at any given moment can be a challenge. In recent weeks, several aides who\u2019d been advising Trump are no longer playing formal roles. They include Mike McSherry, a veteran party strategist who worked on the convention, and Doug Davenport, a longtime lobbyist who helped with the convention and Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania primary effort. Rick Gates, who was Manafort\u2019s top deputy, is also expected to soon depart, according to three sources familiar with his plans \u2014 even though on Aug. 19, the day Manafort resigned, the campaign announced that Gates would be serving as Trump\u2019s liaison to the RNC. (Gates did not respond to requests for comment.) \n \n Some say the campaign narrowly avoided an exodus last month. Following Manafort\u2019s departure, he personally appealed to those he brought on not to leave and to give the new leadership team, led by Conway and Bannon, a chance. \n \n Republicans say Trump still has time \u2014 but not much. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how the Trump campaign gets to 270 where they are today,\u201d said Russ Schriefer, a veteran strategist of presidential campaigns who served as a senior adviser to Romney in 2012. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible, but it would take some external factor and some very lucky breaks for that to happen.\u201d \n \n \u201cThey have to reset the entire race and the entire dynamic,\u201d he added. \u201cThey have a lot of things left to do and a very short amount of time left to do it.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Donald Trump is planning another trip outside his comfort zone with a visit to an African-American church in Detroit on Saturday, and he wasn't planning on taking any risks, according to a leaked script seen by the New York Times. The script contains a dozen questions that Bishop Wayne T. Jackson of Great Faith Ministries International was apparently planning to ask Trump in a closed-door session\u2014and, more unusually for such an appearance, lengthy prepared answers for Trump. \"I treasure my relationship with my family, and through them, I have a strong faith enriched by an ever-wonderful God,\" was Trump's prepared answer for a question about whether he is a Christian. \"I want to make race disappear as a factor in government and governance,\" Trump was directed to say after a question about his vision for black Americans. After the script was leaked, a Trump campaign spokesman said the agenda has now changed and Trump plans to speak to the congregation directly after his interview session with the pastor. In other coverage: The Detroit Free Press looks at the uphill struggle Trump will have in order to win votes in Detroit, where Mitt Romney got just 2% of the vote in 2012. Some analysts believe the real purpose of Trump's visit is to show moderate Republicans elsewhere that he is willing to reach out to different groups of voters. The Washington Post analyzes Trump's latest proposals on immigration, and finds that immigration enforcement costs would leap by more than $50 billion over the next few years in order to put his plan into action. Politico looks at the state of the Trump campaign with 22 days to go before early voting begins. There has been some progress in areas including getting the candidate to stay on-message, but the campaign remains \"transitory and unstable,\" with many aides unsure who is calling the shots. At FiveThirtyEight, Nate Silver notes that the race is tightening as it nears the home stretch\u2014and warns that Clinton supporters are mistaken if they think the electoral college math will save her if it continues to tighten. The Wall Street Journal reports that in his big immigration speech in Arizona Wednesday, Trump had originally planned to avoid mentioning a border wall. He changed his mind and added a line about Mexico paying for the wall after finding out that Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto had told reporters that he told Trump Mexico wouldn't pay. \"I had no choice,\" Trump, who thought they had an agreement not to discuss the wall at their first meeting, tells the Journal. Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani was at the meeting and says that when Pe\u00f1a Nieto declared Mexico wasn't going to pay, he said: \"That's off the table\" and the talks moved to another subject.",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 The race between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump has tightened, according to FiveThirtyEight's election forecast. Clinton, whose lead over Trump exceeded 8 percentage points at her peak following the Democratic convention, is ahead by 4 or 5 percentage points today. The tighter margins in the polls, which reflect a loss of support for Clinton along with a modest improvement for Trump, have come gradually over the past few weeks. The evidence of a tightening has become more widespread, however, and it\u2019s particularly clear in polls that surveyed the race just after the conventions and are retaking its temperature now. Fox News\u2019 national poll, for instance, had Clinton up by 9 points just before the conventions (in the version of the poll that included third-party candidates) and has her up by 2 points now. There isn\u2019t any guarantee that Trump will continue to gain ground. Over the course of the year, polls have oscillated between showing a dead heat at Trump's best moments and a lead of 8 to 10 percentage points for Clinton at her peaks. We\u2019re about halfway between those goal posts now.\"",

MUST WATCH Scalia jokes about hunting with Cheney 01:35 \n \n Scalia was on the losing side of the ruling upholding the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping legislation championed by President Barack Obama. \n \n Chief Justice John Roberts was the deciding vote in that decision, agreeing with his liberal colleagues to uphold the individual mandate, which would financially punish people who do not purchase health insurance. \n \n Some media and blog reports -- citing sources with specific knowledge of the deliberation process -- suggested strong tensions among the court's conservatives over Roberts' vote, which some commentators perceived as political expediency. \n \n But Scalia said it was wrong to question Roberts or other court members personally for their legal conclusions. \n \n \"We are not a political institution,\" Scalia said. \"I don't think any of my colleagues on any cases vote the way they do for political reasons.\" \n \n Scalia added he was dismayed at the criticism of Roberts, suggesting those who may have leaked information were not entirely privy to the internal discussions over the health care decision. \n \n On abortion, Scalia said the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing the medical procedure should be overturned, believing it remains an issue best left for states to decide. \n \n No matter what it does, high court is seen as political \n \n The court doesn't do democracy any favors by getting involved in the abortion debate in such a way, according to Scalia. \n \n Likewise with capital punishment, Scalia said the issue is not whether the court should ultimately decide whether there should still be a death penalty -- he claimed not to have an opinion on that -- but rather whether individual states should decide such a question. \n \n \"If you don't like the death penalty, fine, change the law,\" he said. \"I'm not 'pro' death penalty, I'm 'anti' the idea that is not ultimately a democratic choice.\" \n \n But he emphasized capital punishment has been around since the nation's founding and was well-established in law and social tradition. \n \n And Scalia reiterated his firm views over what he agreed was the most talked-about recent court decision -- the 2000 ruling effectively handing the presidency to George W. Bush after the Florida ballot recounts. \n \n \"Get over it,\" he said about supporters of Al Gore, many of whom are still convinced the case was wrongly decided in favor of the Republican. \"He (Gore) would have lost anyway if all the ballots were recounted.\" \n \n In his new book, Scalia argues interpreting laws and the Constitution properly requires a strict approach to look at the actual text of the law itself. \n \n He warns that squishy, unprincipled decision-making is bad for the country and for the reputation of judges themselves. \n \n \"The descent into social rancor over judicial decisions is largely traceable to nontextual means of interpretation, which erodes society's confidence in a rule of law that evidently has no agreed-upon meaning,\" write Scalia and Garner. \n \n The jaunty jurist has long been able to light up, or ignite, a room with his often brash demeanor and wicked sense of humor, and he displayed that in the hourlong conversation with Morgan. \n \n Despite his reputation as an intellectual fighter, Scalia described himself as \"a peaceful man.\" \n \n When asked if he had ever broken the law, the justice said, \"I've had a few speeding tickets, though none recently.\" \n \n His outgoing personality and sharply written opinions have made him among the most recognizable of justices, and a particular favorite of conservative activists, scholars and lawmakers. President Ronald Reagan named Scalia to the high court in 1986 after previous jobs as an appeals court judge, a government and private lawyer, and a law professor. \n \n Justices finances show overseas travel, book royalties, gifts \n \n \"At one extreme, he can alienate some of his colleagues,\" said Joan Biskupic, legal affairs editor at Reuters, who has written a biography of Scalia. \"If he is trying to get anybody to sign an opinion, it was harder when he would use more combative language. But as much as they would say 'I'd like to strangle Nino,' he was still theirs in many ways.\" \n \n That harshness was evident in the closing days of the term ending in June. On two issues that left Scalia on the losing side -- health care and immigration enforcement -- he displayed the fierce rhetoric that has become his trademark. \n \n Scalia, writing for the minority, argued the court's ruling favoring federal authority over immigration matters encroaches on Arizona's sovereign powers. \n \n \"If securing its territory in this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we should cease referring to it as a sovereign State.\" \n \n \"He can be belligerent; he is obviously very candid about how he feels,\" Biskupic said. \"He loves to call it as he sees it, completely not politically correct. In fact, he prides himself on not being PC on the bench, in court.\" \n \n Many legal scholars say Scalia ultimately failed to sway his colleagues on the really big constitutional issues, and court sources say he has grown somewhat frustrated over the years being on the losing side of many cases, or not being able to write more majority opinions. \n \n Antonin Gregory Scalia was born in 1936 and admitted to being the center of attention as the only child, doted on by his father, a Sicilian-born professor of romance languages, and his mother, a schoolteacher. They instilled a love of learning and the confidence to exercise his intellectual muscles. \n \n He attended Georgetown University as an undergrad, and later Harvard Law School, where he met his future wife, Maureen McCarthy, who was attending nearby Radcliffe. They raised nine children, including a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve, and a priest. The family is united by a strong Catholic faith. \n \n When asked about his greatest achievement as a judge, Scalia went back to the foundation of his book. He said he hoped he has moved his colleagues toward a more textured view of the law. \n \n \"The court pays more attention now to the text\" of the law and the Constitution, he said, and less to legislative history, congressional floor debates and the views of foreign governments. For a lover of language, the precise meaning of words contained in the law has been his goal. \n \n And he has no plans to step down anytime soon. \n \n \"Of course, I'll retire when I start to realize I'm not doing as good a job as I should,\" he said, adding he still thinks he is fully engaged. \n \n Taking a look at Scalia's influence, defiance ||||| Coming up this evening at 9 p.m., \"Piers Morgan Tonight\" welcomes Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia for a rare and candid sit-down interview. \n \n Joining the Court's longest-serving justice in Washington D.C., host Piers Morgan asks his guest to recount his most-contentious case: \n \n \"Well, I guess the one that created the most waves of disagreement was Bush v.

Fiat Chrysler said it meets all applicable regulatory requirements and will work with President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s administration to contest the allegations. \n \n Fiat Chrysler becomes the second automaker in less than three years the EPA has accused of violating the law by using software to pass laboratory emissions tests. Volkswagen, which admitted to using defeat devices in September 2015, agreed Wednesday to pay a $4.3 billion fine, boosting the cost of the scandal to about 20.5 billion euros ($21.9 billion). \n \n Fiat Chrysler\u2019s case is \u201ccompletely different\u201d from Volkswagen\u2019s, Chief Executive Officer Sergio Marchionne said in a call with reporters Thursday. He called the timing of the EPA\u2019s notice of a violation \u201cvery strange\u201d and said the Italian-American automaker rescued by the Obama administration in 2009 had discussed emissions with the EPA for more than a year. \n \n \u201cI am really ticked off,\u201d Marchionne said. Fiat Chrysler fell as much as 18 percent, the biggest intraday drop since the stock began trading in October 2014. The shares pared losses after the CEO\u2019s conference call, trading down 10 percent to $9.95 as of 4:15 p.m. in New York. \n \n Fiat Chrysler\u2019s alleged violations could result in fines of as much as $44,539 per vehicle, Cynthia Giles, the EPA\u2019s enforcement chief, said Thursday. The total potential penalty could be as much as $4.6 billion, based on the cost per vehicle and the number of 2014 through 2016 model year SUVs and trucks. When the EPA first revealed Volkswagen\u2019s wrongdoing in September 2015, the company faced punishment of up to $18 billion. \n \n \u2018Clear Violation\u2019 \n \n \u201cOur meetings with Fiat Chrysler to date have not produced a viable explanation\u201d for the software, Giles said during a conference call the EPA hosted with reporters. \u201cThis is a clear violation of the Clean Air Act.\u201d \n \n New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said his office will investigate the EPA\u2019s claims against Fiat Chrysler, saying in a statement he was \u201cdeeply troubled\u201d and would work with state and federal partners. \n \n Fiat Chrysler plans to work with the Trump administration to \u201cpresent its case and resolve this matter fairly and equitably,\u201d the automaker said in a statement. \n \n The company\u2019s bonds also fell. Its $1.47 billion of 5.25 percent coupon notes due in 2023 sank 4 cents to 99.7 cents at 11:19 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. That\u2019s the biggest decline since the notes were sold in July 2015. \n \n Read More: FCA Suppliers Tumble After EPA Allegations \n \n Enhanced Testing \n \n The EPA says it discovered Fiat Chrysler\u2019s allegedly illegal software while conducting enhanced testing of other diesel vehicles in the wake of Volkswagen\u2019s scandal. The agency said it\u2019s now up to Fiat Chrysler to demonstrate the software was not a defeat device. \n \n \u201cChrysler\u2019s alleged misbehavior -- rigging its trucks, VW-like, to increase pollution of our lungs and lying about it -- is appalling,\u201d Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Campaign, said in an e-mailed statement. \n \n The EPA\u2019s violation notice said Fiat Chrysler\u2019s diesel engine system had eight control devices changing the emissions of the vehicles under certain conditions that the company didn\u2019t disclose. \n \n Not all such systems are cheat devices like Volkswagen used, according to John German, senior fellow at the International Council on Clean Transportation, a Washington-based non-profit that conducts technical and scientific analysis. ICCT played a central role in exposing Volkswagen\u2019s cheat devices. \n \n Devices Allowed \n \n The government allows control devices, but they can\u2019t be used to change emissions to meet testing requirements and they must be disclosed, German said. \n \n \u201cThe EPA is still investigating whether these are cheat devices,\u201d he said in a phone interview. \u201cVW got hit hard because they lied, covered it up and didn\u2019t have a fix.\u201d \n \n Marchionne said he presumes the U.S. Justice Department also is investigating the company. Fiat Chrysler\u2019s software wasn\u2019t used to bypass emissions tests or operate differently during evaluations than in real-world use, he said, calling such allegations \u201cabsolute nonsense.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis software doesn\u2019t look for anything,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just runs.\u201d ||||| Columbus Day seems like a fitting debut for Fiat Chrysler on the New York Stock Exchange, don't you think? This is an Italian-American success story after all. \n \n Shares of Fiat Chrysler began trading on the NYSE Monday under the ticker symbol FCAU. Fiat Chrysler opened at $9 and quickly moved as high as $9.55 before pulling back a bit. \n \n Chrysler hasn't been publicly traded in the United States in more than seven years. At that time it was known as DaimlerChrysler. Daimler (DDAIF) agreed to sell Chrysler to private equity firm Cerberus in 2007. \n \n Fiat's stock had previously traded as Fiat SpA (FIATY)in Milan and the United States. Those shares have outperformed GM (GM) and Ford (F) so far this year, largely due to the resurgence of Chrysler -- the smallest of Detroit's Big Three. \n \n Chrysler reported a sales increase of 19% in the United States last month compared to a year ago. That is Chrysler's 54th consecutive month of year-over-year sales gains. \n \n The company has done particularly well with larger vehicles, which are becoming more popular again as gas prices fall. Jeep sales are surging, as are sales of Chrysler's Ram trucks. \n \n Related: Ford shares shift into reverse \n \n Chrysler has turned its fortunes around since Fiat, led by enigmatic CEO Sergio Marchionne, took control of the company following its 2009 bankruptcy. Fiat initially purchased a 20% stake in Chrysler and now owns the whole company. The combined business is profitable as well, no small feat given how bad things got during 2008 and 2009. \n \n But can Fiat Chrysler grow further? Right now, it still is just the seventh-largest automaker in the world by sales. In addition to trailing Ford and GM, it's also smaller than Toyota (TM), Volkswagen (VLKAF), Renault-Nissan and Hyundai-Kia. \n \n Marchionne hinted in a recent interview with Bloomberg Businessweek that there could be more consolidation in the auto industry and that Fiat Chrysler could be a buyer. \n \n There has been chatter over the past few years about the possibility of a combination between Fiat and Honda (HMC) or Suzuki (SZKMF). Fiat also announced a partnership with Mitsubishi Motors last month in which Mitsubishi will produce new midsized pickup trucks for Fiat in Europe and Latin America. Could a full-blown merger of the two be next? \n \n Any of these would be a bold deal that could catapult Chrysler ahead of Ford in the global sales rankings. \n \n Marchionne has said that he plans to step down as Fiat Chrysler CEO in 2018. So if he wants to do another huge deal to make the company even bigger, he's only got a few years to add to his legacy. ||||| DETROIT (AP) \u2014 The U.S. government is accusing Fiat Chrysler of failing to disclose software in some of its pickups and SUVs with diesel engines that allows them to emit more pollution than allowed under the Clean Air Act. \n \n The Environmental Protection Agency said in a statement Thursday that it issued a \"notice of violation\" to the company that covers about 104,000 vehicles including the 2014 through 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram pickups, all with 3-liter diesel engines. The California Air Resources Board took similar action. \n \n The EPA scheduled a news conference Thursday to explain details of the case. \n \n \"Failing to disclose software that affects emissions in a vehicle's engine is a serious violation of the law, which can result in harmful pollution in the air we breathe,\" said Cynthia Giles, EPA assistant administrator for enforcement and compliance. \n \n The agency said it will continue to investigate the \"nature and impact\" of the devices. The agency said FCA may be liable for civil penalties for the alleged violations of the Clean Air Act.

(Photo: Alan Diaz, AP) \n \n DETROIT \u2014 U.S. regulators accused Fiat Chrysler Automobiles of violating emissions standards in more than 100,000 diesel vehicles, spawning concerns that the company could become ensnared in a scandal like the one that engulfed Volkswagen Group. \n \n The Environmental Protection Agency said Thursday that Fiat Chrysler illegally installed software on about 104,000 pickups and sport-utility vehicles that spewed harmful pollutants while failing to disclose the technology. \n \n The allegations involve the 2014, 2015 and 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee and light-duty Ram 1500 pickup trucks with 3-liter diesel engines. \n \n The EPA said the automaker installed eight different undisclosed software programs on the vehicles, collectively causing them to spew harmful nitrous oxide emissions, which can exacerbate respiratory conditions. \n \n \"This is a clear and serious violation of the Clean Air Act,\" said Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for the EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance. \"There is no doubt they are contributing to illegal pollution.\" \n \n Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne blasted the EPA in a quickly arranged media call, saying he was offended by the agency's \"incredibly belligerent\" attacks on the auto industry. He said his company had done nothing illegally, and to try to dispel comparisons to Volkswagen's crisis. \n \n \"There is nothing in common between the VW reality and what we are describing here,\" he said. It's \"absolute nonsense\" to suggest so, he said, and anyone who disagreed with him is \"smoking illegal material.\" Marchionne insisted that Fiat Chrysler has been forthright. \n \n \"We're trying to do an honest job here. We're not trying to break the bloody law,\" he told reporters. \n \n Marchionne rejected the suggestion that rogue employees could have schemed to violate EPA laws. \"If I found a guy like that, I would have hung them on a door,\" he said. \n \n Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) shares trading on the New York Stock Exchange were down about 9% after initially tumbling 14% on the news as investors fretted about the financial implications. \n \n New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said his office would investigate Fiat Chrysler. Marcionne said he believes the U.S. Justice Department is assisting the EPA with its investigation. \n \n Several analysts said the company's sin may have been solely of disclosure, not an intentionally deceptive act like that at VW. \n \n \"Software which adjusts the emissions of an engine is standard practice across the industry,\" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a note to investors. \"It is the failure to disclose which seems to be the primary cause of concern at the EPA.\" \n \n The EPA has the authority to fine automakers up to $44,539 per vehicle for the worst violations of the Clean Air Act. The agency threatened possible fines Thursday if it determines that the software installed on the vehicles qualifies as illegal \"defeat devices\" under U.S. laws. \n \n Kelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland said there was no indication that Fiat Chrysler intentionally cheated. \n \n \"They're not meeting the standards, but right now, it doesn't appear to be the same type of deliberate act that Volkswagen admitted to,\" she said. \n \n Lindland said the mistake might have been a failure to mention the technology when requesting EPA certification to sell the vehicles. \n \n \"It's like bringing a calculator to your math test \u2014 you're allowed to bring it, and it's one thing to have it on your desk, but it's another thing to have it in your lap,\" she said. \n \n Fiat Chrysler said in a statement that it offered to the EPA to develop software fixes to \"further improve emissions performance\" because it wants to \"resolve this matter fairly and equitably.\" \n \n The vehicles were programmed with software that violated standards and was not disclosed to the EPA, Giles said. In lab testing, the vehicles met standards, but at high speeds and in extended driving, they violate regulations, the EPA's Giles said. \n \n \"That means that the vehicles were sold illegally,\" she said. \n \n The EPA said it discovered the alleged violations after expanding its testing of on-road vehicle performance following the Volkswagen scandal. \n \n Volkswagen admitted to cheating emissions laws on more than half a million vehicles and has agreed to criminal and civil settlements totaling nearly $22 billion. Six VW executives were charged Wednesday with allegedly weaving a conspiracy to dodge regulations while the company pleaded guilty to similar charges on a corporate level. \n \n In Volkswagen's case, vehicles spewed NOx emissions at rates up to 40 times the U.S. standard. Giles declined to provide a comparable assessment for Fiat Chrysler. \n \n Marchionne sought to distance Fiat Chrysler from VW. \n \n \"To be perfectly honest, I think it's being blown out of proportion,\" he said. \"I find this to be a bizarre characterization of FCA's activities, and we will defend our behavior.\" \n \n Unlike VW, the EPA has not ordered Fiat Chrysler to halt sales of diesel vehicles accused of violations. Marchionne said he would not stop sales proactively. \n \n The Fiat Chrysler Automobiles Group sign at the Chrysler Group headquarters May 6, 2014, in Auburn Hills, Mich. (Photo: Bill Pugliano, Getty Images) \n \n It's not unusual for Marchionne to take a combative stance against a federal regulatory agency. Marchionne pushed back against the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2013 when the agency initially recommended a recall of 2.7 million Jeep SUVs for potentially dangerous rear-mounted fuel tanks. \n \n Eventually, the agency agreed to allow FCA to reduce the recall to include 1.56 million Jeep Grand Cherokees for model years 1993 to 2004 and the Jeep Liberty model years 2002 to 2007. \n \n The following year, the NHTSA was again critical of the automaker for the slow repair rate of those Jeeps. \n \n Contributing:Brent Snavely, Detroit Free Press \n \n Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2jAdL6R",

    "document": "The adage about a picture being worth a thousand words never seemed as true as it did early Monday morning, when a video clip shot around the Internet showing a passenger being violently removed from a United Airlines plane in Chicago for refusing to be \u201cvoluntarily\u201d bumped from the flight. \n \n United no doubt will expend thousands of words explaining or apologizing for this incident in coming hours, days and weeks. It won\u2019t help. The video is just too raw. \n \n Indeed, the airline\u2019s initial response to the publicity already has left it covered in shame. \n \n This is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers. \u2014 United CEO Oscar Munoz \n \n United\u2019s PR department first issued a statement explaining blandly that the Chicago-to-Louisville flight late Sunday was overbooked, and that \u201cafter our team looked for volunteers, one customer refused to leave the aircraft voluntarily and law enforcement was asked to come to the gate. We apologize for the overbook situation. Further details on the removed customer should be directed to authorities.\u201d \n \n United CEO Oscar Munoz then made things worse with a statement of Orwellian doublespeak. \u201cThis is an upsetting event to all of us here at United,\u201d he said. \u201cI apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers,\u201d whatever that means. \n \n [UPDATE: According to CNBC, Munoz followed up Monday evening with a letter to employees defending the airline\u2019s ground staff and describing the still-unidentified passenger as \u201cdisruptive and belligerent.\u201d He said the airline agents \u201cwere left with no choice but to call Chicago Aviation Security Officers to assist in removing the customer from the flight.\u201d \n \n [But Munoz, whose version of the episode appears to come from the playbook of how to dig oneself into an ever deeper hole, also undermined the argument that the flight was overbooked. He related that \u201cafter the flight was fully boarded,\u201d gate agents \u201cwere approached by crewmembers that were told they needed to board the flight.\u201d The implication is that the crewmembers heading to Louisville were late in arriving, that every passenger held a paid ticket and had been properly boarded, and only that only belatedly did United decide to pull passengers off the plane to make room. \n \n [It\u2019s unclear from United\u2019s contract of carriage how either its rule regarding \u201crefusal of transport\u201d (Rule 21) or \u201cdenied boarding compensation\u201d (Rule 25) applies to a passenger already seated and instructed to deplane to make room for a company employee rather than another paying passenger. \n \n [Whether United had \u201cno choice\u201d but to forcibly eject the passenger also is questionable, as presumably the airline could have transported its crewmembers to Louisville either by road (a five-hour drive) or by chartering another aircraft. In any event, Munoz in his letter asserts that \u201ctreating our customers and each other with respect and dignity is at the core of who we are.\u201d] \n \n Plainly this was a botched job in countless ways and at multiple levels. The reports are that the flight was the last one to Louisville on Sunday, and that United offered passengers up to $800 plus overnight accommodations and an alternative flight leaving Monday afternoon in order to free up four seats for a flight crew needing to reach Louisville. \n \n When you buy a plane ticket, here's what you have to agree to \u00bb \n \n Video posted by United passenger Audra Bridges shows a passenger being forcibly removed from a flight. Video posted by United passenger Audra Bridges shows a passenger being forcibly removed from a flight. SEE MORE VIDEOS \n \n When the voluntary offer failed, four passengers evidently were chosen at random to be involuntarily bumped. This happened after the plane had been loaded, which is certainly an unusual wrinkle in the annals of passenger treatment. One couple went quietly, but another passenger objected. Before being dragged off the plane, he reportedly identified himself as a doctor with patients to see on Monday. When he refused to go, the ground staff summoned airport police, who physically manhandled him out of his seat and dragged him, bloodied, down the aisle as several other passengers documented the event on their smartphones. The plane was delayed by two hours. \n \n What sort of training United offers its personnel to manage such episodes isn\u2019t known, but plainly it stinks. \n \n What\u2019s even more important is what this episode says about the terms and conditions of air travel in the United States. It\u2019s in a bad way. \n \n To begin with, the law allows air carriers to overbook flights \u2014 that is, sell more tickets than they have seats for. That\u2019s plainly a situation that benefits the airlines almost exclusively, because it tends to ensure that every seat will be filled even at the cost of leaving some passengers behind. How many businesses do you know of that can sell you a good or service, accept payment, and then withdraw that good or service unilaterally for their own purposes \u2014 much less by force? \n \n Passengers bumped involuntarily have rights to compensation, but the airlines have great latitude to set their own priority rules for bumping travelers. Typically it\u2019s those paying the lowest fares, lacking membership in a frequent-flyer program, or checking in late who are most at risk. Bumpees who are going to be more than two hours late to a domestic destination are entitled to compensation of 400% of their one-way fare, up to $1,350, plus the value of their ticket. \n \n These rules, obviously, are in dire need of upgrading to suit modern conditions. The Department of Transportation acknowledges in its outline of passenger rights that some passengers may be more amenable to voluntary bumping than others, or more flexible in their travel plans: \u201cAlmost any planeload of airline passengers includes some people with urgent travel needs and others who may be more concerned about the cost of their tickets than about getting to their destination on time.\u201d The agency encourages airlines to \u201cnegotiate with their passengers for mutually acceptable compensation\u201d in order to secure needed seats. \n \n As Daniel Gross observed at Slate.com, airlines have squeezed their overbooking privilege until it screams for mercy, even as they\u2019re consistently flying fuller planes. (Question: When was the last time you boarded a plane that had more than a small handful of middle seats open?) In the most recent boom-and-bust airline cycle, the industry \u201cload factor\u201d \u2014 the percentage of seats filled \u2014 bottomed out at 72.21% in February 2009, in the teeth of a crushing recession, but more recently has run in the mid-80s. That appears to be as high as it\u2019s been in this century and may be an absolute limit, because some routes will never run at 100%. ||||| United Airlines has been a real dick lately. On Monday morning, the world woke up to a very disturbing video of a hapless passenger being bloodied and dragged off an overbooked flight so that a United employee flying stand-by could fly instead. This is just the latest in an increasingly enraging pattern of bad behavior by the airline. So what can you do about it? Easy: stop giving United your money. \n \n This peaceful form of protest is called a boycott, and it\u2019s loads of fun. If you stop flying United and tell all your friends to stop flying United, the airline will suffer, and at least a sliver of justice will be served. The best part is that there are plenty of other airlines out there that don\u2019t abuse passengers and refuse to apologize. (United did apologize for \u201cthe overbook situation\u201d but not for the abuse.) Other airlines will gladly take your money and make sure you get to your destination without enlisting a muscleman to slam your head into an armrest and forcibly remove you from the plane so that one of its employees can get a free flight. This is not a normal thing to do. Even the airline\u2019s CEO couldn\u2019t properly apologize for what happened. \n \n Advertisement \n \n What\u2019s especially despicable about United is the fact that this latest jaw-dropping incident doesn\u2019t seem out of the ordinary for the airline. It was just a couple of weeks ago that United refused to allow three young girls to board their flight, because they were wearing leggings. United didn\u2019t apologize for that incident, instead pointing concerned customers to an arcane clause in its contact of carriage. That opened United up to a real shitstorm of bad press. Then again, United must be used to this kind of thing by now. \n \n There are plenty more incidents that suggest that United Airlines is an evil company. Last year, former Port Authority chairman David Samson pleaded guilty to a felony count of conspiracy after an investigation revealed that Samson had given United permission to build a hangar in exchange for the airline reopening a route between Newark and Columbia, South Carolina, close to where the chairman had a weekend home. The favor-trading scandal also led to Jeff Smisek to resign as United\u2019s CEO. Two other senior executives also resigned in disgrace. \n \n Advertisement \n \n But wait, there\u2019s more. Just a few months before Smisek\u2019s resignation, United made headlines for diverting a flight in order to kick an autistic child off of a flight. This happened after fellow passengers claimed that the child was not being disruptive and pleaded with the flight crew to be more sensitive to the her needs. United apparently didn\u2019t apologize for that incident initially, even though the local police who had to take the autistic child off the plane did. In response to the incident, hundreds called for a boycott of United flights. \n \n Two weeks after the incident with autistic girl, United fucked up again! Tahera Ahmad, a Muslim chaplain at Northwestern University accused the airline of discrimination after she requested an unopened can of Diet Coke for \u201chygienic reasons\u201d and the flight attendant refused. \u201cWell I\u2019m sorry I just can\u2019t give you an unopened can so no Diet Coke for you,\u201d the flight attendant reportedly said. But then, she gave an unopened can of beer to the man sitting next to Ahmad. When the Muslim woman protested, the flight attendant said, \u201cWe are unauthorized to give unopened cans to people because they may use it as a weapon on the plane.\u201d The call for a United boycott was quickly renewed when the story went viral on Facebook. \n \n Advertisement \n \n So it\u2019s safe to say that this United boycott idea is overdue. After all, the above horror stories are just a sampling of United\u2019s bad behavior from the past couple years, and it seems obvious that they aren\u2019t just isolated incidents. There seems to be a systematic pattern of United treating passengers badly and even engaging in corrupt dealings with the authorities. This is probably why United consistently ranks as one of the worst airlines for customer service. The airline is so terrible that last it enlisted a team to figure out how to be less awful. Clearly, they didn\u2019t figure it out because United\u2019s bad behavior seems to be getting worse, now that the airline is bringing in hired goons to bloody up passengers who are just trying to get home. \n \n Do you want to get beat up by a mercenary on your next flight? Of course you don\u2019t. So stop flying United, and tell your friends to stop flying United. There are plenty of good airlines out there. You shouldn\u2019t have to give your money to a bad one. ||||| In case the viral video of police violently dragging a man off an overbooked United Airlines flight in Chicago didn\u2019t make it clear, let us repeat: Airlines often have more passengers than available seats and some carriers, apparently, aren\u2019t afraid to kick you off. \n \n United said it not have enough room for all its booked passengers because it had to transport four crew members to Louisville for another flight. \n \n United\u2019s fumbling of the situation is one matter. Here\u2019s a look at what overbooking is\u2014and why airlines do it. \n \n Why are there more tickets than seats? \n \n Airlines frequently sell more seats on their flights than the airplane holds, a way to guard against passengers who cancel or somehow fail to make it to the airport. It\u2019s legal, and airlines won\u2019t it abandon the practice anytime soon because they would leave precious pennies on the table when passengers are no-shows. No airline wants to give passengers compensation, so United\u2019s incident also exposes what might be a poorly managed inventory system. \n \n Do I have to get off the airplane? \n \n Yes. There are two ways passengers can be denied boarding: voluntarily and involuntarily. The US Department of Transportation requires airlines to first seek volunteers to take a later flight and carriers will generally offer compensation in the form of a voucher for future travel. If you go for this option, negotiate the terms and make sure the airline tells you if there are any blackout dates to use the voucher. The voucher amount can vary, depending on how many volunteers are needed and how many people are willing to get bumped. If 10 people come forward in hopes of a voucher, you\u2019ll likely be disappointed because there could be more than enough volunteers. That will likely mean not the sweetest of offers. \n \n What if no one wants to take another flight? \n \n This is where airlines get nervous, and passengers should too. Without volunteers, airlines can pick passengers at random to get bumped. They make money when the planes are in the sky, not at the gate, so they\u2019ll want to ensure they don\u2019t hold up the plane. The Department of Transportation and airlines\u2019 contracts of carriage spell out the amount of compensation, which depends on the fare and how long it will be before bumped passenger can fly. \n \n If the airline offers you a new flight that will get you to your destination within an hour of your original arrival time, there is no compensation. If the new flight\u2019s arrival is within one to two hours after the original arrival time, compensation must be at least 200% of the flight cost, but with a limit of $675. \n \n On the Chicago to Louisville flight caught on video, United reportedly offered $800 and two people accepted. Under federal rules, if the substitute flight will get you to your final destination more than two hours later, or if the airline doesn\u2019t make any other travel arrangements, compensation is 400% of the fare ,up to $1,350. United caps compensation at $1,350. \n \n The passenger in the video was reportedly a doctor who refused to be bumped because he had patients scheduled the next day, according to the Courier-Journal. \n \n Following a series of large airline mergers, passengers have fewer carriers to to choose from, an issue that crops up during technical glitches that ground airlines. That means that if passengers are involuntarily bumped but absolutely need to fly (think: a wedding, a funeral, a vital meeting) they have fewer carriers on which to catch a last-minute flight. \n \n Can an airline forcibly remove me? \n \n Yes. Airlines have a low bar for kicking passengers off planes. Any boarding disturbance could delay the flight\u2019s departure, or if an incident escalates in the air, it could force the pilot to divert to another airport, a costly detour. \n \n An airline can remove you from a flight for screaming at passengers, insulting a president\u2019s daughter (yes, really), singing, or even for smelling badly. \n \n Under those rules, the United crew on Sunday generally would be allowed to deem the passenger a security risk merely for his refusal to obey crew instructions. That brings on airport security or the police. \n \n Isn\u2019t there a better way? \n \n Probably. The backlash against United on social media has been swift following the alarming images of the bloodied passenger. Higher compensation to the passengers might have drawn more volunteers, and saved the airline from yet another public-relations black eye like last month\u2019s leggings debacle. Certainly the airline could have afforded to offer more\u2014its profits topped $2 billion last year.",

Estes is far from the only person outraged\u2014Sasha Lekach at Mashable calls United's attempts at apologizing for the situation \"meaningless corporate jargon\" that just enraged people more. At the Los Angeles Times, Michael Hiltzik says United's handling of the entire incident was \"botched\" and shameful, but notes that the real problem is that the law allows airlines to overbook, even at risk of a situation like this. \"How many businesses do you know of that can sell you a good or service, accept payment, and then withdraw that good or service unilaterally for their own purposes\u2014much less by force?\" At Slate, Daniel Gross calls the overbooking system airlines use \"ridiculous\" and \"outdated,\" and notes that lately, more passengers than usual are getting bumped from overbooked flights, a fair number of them involuntarily: It's time for \"a better way,\" he writes.

    "generated_summary": "\u2013 A video that went viral Monday shows a man being violently removed from a United Airlines flight in Chicago, the Huffington Post reports. According to the New York Daily News, the man was forced off the plane after refusing to pay a $10,000 fare. The man, identified as 69-year-old David Dao, was on his way to a doctor's appointment when he was told he had to be removed from the plane because of a medical emergency. Dao was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for dehydration and hypothermia. He was released a few hours later. In the video, Dao can be heard telling the flight crew that he wants to leave the plane, but they won't let him because they don't think it's safe. He says he has a ticket for the next flight but they will not give it to him. The video went viral after it was posted to Twitter by a passenger who said he was on a United flight from Chicago to Louisville, Ky., and that he was being removed because of safety concerns. A United spokesperson tells the Daily News that they do not have any plans to remove Dao from the flight. In a statement, United calls the incident a \"publicity stunt\" and says it has no plans to \"punish\" Dao or his family. The airline says it is cooperating with authorities.",

(Associated Press) \n \n Tattered and dirty, Ricky Gilmore's blue jeans tell part of the story. His body tells the rest _ the skin on his left leg and buttocks is shredded, his wrist is sprained and his kidneys are in bad shape from going without food and water. \n \n \"Ah man, I'm just a big mess. I ache and I'm just in the first stages of healing,\" he said Tuesday at the Northern Navajo Medical Center in Shiprock, N.M. \n \n Gilmore, 49, is being treated for acute kidney failure from dehydration, a sprained wrist and a blood infection. He spent two days in intensive care and it could be at least another week before he can go home. \n \n The Farmington Daily Times first reported Gilmore's story. He was found along a seldom-traveled road on the Navajo Nation about 10 miles from his home in Newcomb, which is on the eastern side of the reservation. \n \n Gilmore said he was dropped in the desert by a couple in a white truck whom he met while he was hitchhiking. He had invited them to his home for steaks, and they later went for what Gilmore thought was going to be a joyride. \n \n When he declined to share his alcohol with them, Gilmore said the man grabbed him by his feet and threw him out of the truck while parked along the desolate road. \n \n It was early evening and Gilmore had nothing _ no wheelchair, no food, no water, no coat _ to help him endure the flat desert scrubland. \n \n \"It was dark and I was shivering and the wind was blowing so I just crawled to a bush and dug in right there. It was cold that night,\" he said. \n \n With the sunrise, survival mode kicked in. \n \n \"I started dragging myself. I did the same thing all day and I only got about two miles,\" he said. \n \n Two people passed by. Gilmore tried flagging them down but they only honked and kept going. \n \n After spending a second night at the side of the road, Gilmore said he woke up sore and thirsty and didn't want to move. \n \n \"I could have easily gave up and said `Forget it,' but I said `I'm not going to freeze out here' and I just kept on going,\" said Gilmore, who lives by himself and lost the use of his legs in a car crash years ago. \n \n On the third afternoon, a man in a blue pickup truck stopped and called for help. Gilmore said doctors told him his body temperature was 94 when he was found. \n \n \"I don't think I would have made it another night,\" he said. \n \n The Daily Times reported that Gilmore filed a report with Shiprock police. No officials at the department after hours Tuesday could confirm details of the report. \n \n Gilmore said he's bandaged up \"big time\" and morphine is helping with the pain. Still, he had a nightmare Monday night in which he found himself sitting at the edge of a freeway waving his hands at the passing traffic, but no one looked at him. \n \n His plan is simple for when he gets released from the hospital: \"Go home and pray, take inventory and just get a good night sleep in my own bed and heal.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Susan Montoya Bryan on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/susanmbryanNM ||||| Print Email Font Resize Font Resize Paraplegic man left without wheelchair in desert for three days \n \n SHIPROCK \u2014 Looking into the eyes of Ricky Gilmore, one can tell he has taken many roads but none like the one he dragged himself down last week. SHIPROCK \u2014 Looking into the eyes of Ricky Gilmore, one can tell he has taken many roads but none like the one he dragged himself down last week. Gilmore, a 49-year-old paraplegic from Newcomb, was left without his wheelchair on a desolate dirt road after he hitchhiked with a woman and man near Shiprock on Oct. 16. For two nights and three days, Gilmore scooted against the dirt and rocks of the road not knowing if he would be found. During the darkness of the night, he would ball up to keep warm. He had many enemies he did not have the use of his legs, he had no water or food and it was dreadfully cold. He said he pulled himself about four miles and wondered about the wild animals he would not be able to fight off. \"It was torture,\" said Gilmore at the Northern Navajo Medical Center on Tuesday. Gilmore winced while recalling the ordeal, which began as a quick trip from Newcomb to Shiprock to buy liquor. The trip became somewhat of a \"joy ride,\" he said. The woman and man he hitched a ride with picked up another man, then took Gilmore home, dropped off his wheelchair, then dropped off one man elsewhere followed by a cruise on the Devil's Highway, U.S. Highway 491. That's where hell broke loose, and the woman and the passenger decided Gilmore had to go. \"I didn't think anything like this would happen,\" Gilmore said. He recalled the man yanking him out of the truck by his ankles. \"I was just trying to plead with him not to pull me out but he had those wild, devilish eyes,\" he said. Advertisement \"I did not want to fight back...if i did fight back all hell would come loose...I know gangsters like that, they just that start clubbing away.\" At the hospital, he leaned to his side to show large cuts that he got from pulling himself on the ground. The cuts went across his buttocks and legs. They were covered by wide swaths of bandage and oozed. The wounds were worse when he was found by Wilfred Sisco on Thursday on the dirt at the side of Tocito Road, about 30 miles south of Shiprock. Gilmore waved desperately when Sisco found him. His thighs were bleeding, his body shivering, and his right wrist sprained. Sisco called an ambulance, which then took him to the hospital where he received treatment for a blood infection and acute kidney failure the result of the excessive energy he put into moving his upper half, hospital officials said. He also had a body temperature of 94 when he first received treatment normal is 98.6. His wrist and shoulders were sore after his misery. On his hospital bed, Gilmore showed his ragged pair of jeans, sadly looking through the holes created while he scooted himself over rocks and dirt. The jeans, threadbare, still were the color of the dirt and blood that soaked into them for three days. Then, his button-up shirt, also worn through because of the rubbing on the road. At night, the few items he had did little to keep him warm, he said. \"I didn't have a jacket. All I had was my shirt. I just curled up,\" Gilmore said, who does not think he would have lasted a third night. \"I mean, it was cold.\" The recorded lows for both nights were around 40 in Farmington, though it can sometimes be slightly colder or warmer in the desert, according to the National Weather Service in Albuquerque. The absolute worst part of it, though, Gilmore said, was not the actual survival but the thought that someone would do that to him in the first place. \"I mean, I'm in a wheelchair. They should have that respect for people who have a disability. I was just being nice,\" he said. \"The disrespect, you know, for people with disabilities. I didn't do nothing to them.\" During the first two days he was stranded, three vehicles, including one from the Native American Church, passed by Gilmore while he waved at them. \"They just don't have a heart,\" said Gilmore. Gilmore said he has been hitchhiking for 19 years, since he lost the use of his legs in a car crash on his 30th birthday. Once he makes it home from the hospital, he intends to stop hitchhiking for a while, he said. The Shiprock Police Department is working on a pending police report filed by Gilmore on Thursday. Gilmore described the pair who abandoned him as Native American. The man, who allegedly pulled Gilmore out of the vehicle, is in his mid-20s and has a cursive written tattoo on his neck. The female is heavyset and in her mid-40s. Both suspects are believed to be from the Shiprock or Kirtland area. The pair was driving a white pickup. Gilmore said he feels lucky to have survived. \"I just got on the devil's ride,\" Gilmore said. \"I just want to heal up and go home and change my life around and keep going,\" Gilmore said.",

It took under 10 seconds to hit the target. \n \n \"The shot in question actually disrupted a Daesh [Islamic State] attack on Iraqi security forces,\" said a military source. \"Instead of dropping a bomb that could potentially kill civilians in the area, it is a very precise application of force and because it was so far way, the bad guys didn't have a clue what was happening.\" \n \n The military source said the JTF2 operation fell within the strictures of the government's advise and assist mission. \n \n \"As stated multiple times in the past, members of the Canadian Special Operations Task Force do not accompany leading combat elements, but enable the Iraqi security forces who are in a tough combat mission,\" the statement said. \"This takes the form of advice in planning their operations and assistance to defeat Daesh through the use of coalition resources.\" \n \n The kill was independently verified by video camera and other data, The Globe and Mail has learned. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n \"Hard data on this. It isn't an opinion. It isn't an approximation. There is a second location with eyes on with all the right equipment to capture exactly what the shot was,\" another military source said. \n \n A military insider told The Globe: \"This is an incredible feat. It is a world record that might never be equalled.\" \n \n The world record was previously held by British sniper Craig Harrison, who shot a Taliban gunner with a 338 Lapua Magnum rifle from 2,475 metres away in 2009. \n \n Previously, Canadian Corporal Rob Furlong had set the world record in 2002 at 2,430 metres when he gunned down an Afghan insurgent carrying an RPK machine gun during Operation Anaconda. \n \n Weeks before, Canadian Master Cpl. Arron Perry briefly held the world's best sniper record after he fatally shot an insurgent at 2,310 metres during the same operation. Both soldiers were members of the 3rd Battalion Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry. \n \n JTF2 special forces are primarily tasked with counterterrorism, sniper operations and hostage rescue. Much of the information about this elite organization is classified and not commented on by the government. The unit's snipers and members of Canadian Special Operations Regiment, who are carrying out the main task of training Kurdish forces, have been operating in tough conditions in Iraq. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n The Trudeau government pulled CF-18 fighter jets out of Iraq in 2016 but expanded the military mission, which will see the number of Canadian special forces trainers climb to 207 from 69 in an assist, train and advise mission. Canadian commandos are not supposed to be involved in direct combat, but are authorized to go up to the front lines on training missions with Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and to paint targets for coalition air strikes. \n \n For operational security reasons, sources would not reveal the names of the elite Canadian sniper and his partner, nor the location where the action took place. \n \n A sniper and his observer partner are often sent to remote and dangerous locations to hunt down insurgents while having to carry heavy equipment. Once they have located the target, snipers follow the same methodical approach before each shot. Breathe in, out, in, out, find a natural pause and then squeeze the trigger. \n \n Canada has a reputation among Western military forces for the quality of its snipers, despite the small size of the Canadian Armed Forces compared to the United States and Britain. \n \n \"Canada has a world-class sniper system. It is not just a sniper. They work in pairs. There is an observer,\" a military source said. \"This is a skill set that only a very few people have.\" \n \n The skill of the JTF2 sniper in taking down an insurgent at 3,540 metres required math skills, great eyesight, precision of ammunition and firearms, and superb training. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n \"It is at the distance where you have to account not just for the ballistics of the round, which change over time and distance, you have to adjust for wind, and the wind would be swirling,\" said a source with expertise in training Canadian special forces. \n \n \"You have to adjust for him firing from a higher location downward and as the round drops you have to account for that. And from that distance you actually have to account for the curvature of the Earth.\" \n \n U.S. Sergeant Bryan Kremer has the longest confirmed sniper kill shot by a U.S. soldier. He killed an Iraqi insurgent with his Barrett M82A1 rifle at 2,300 metres in 2004. ||||| The distances are mind-boggling: in 2002, Master Cpl. Arron Perry from the Princess Patricia\u2019s Canadian Light Infantry took aim at an Afghan insurgent from a distance of 2,300 metres and hit his target, setting the world record for the longest confirmed kill shot in military history. Not long after, Cpl. Rob Furlong, in the same operation, bested his brother-in-arms with a confirmed kill at 2,430 metres. His record would stand longer, until 2009, when a British sniper, Craig Harrison, made a shot from 2,475 metres. \n \n On June 21, Harrison\u2019s record was shattered by another Canadian, an elite special forces sniper, who, according to the Canadian military, killed an ISIS fighter in Mosul from an incredible 3,540 metres. \n \n Let\u2019s put that in perspective: if you stacked six CN Towers end to end, you would still be more than 200 metres short. The bullet, according to military experts, would have travelled for nearly 10 seconds before hitting its target. The shooter not only would have had to take into consideration wind conditions, but at that distance, also the curvature of the earth. \n \n More astonishing, perhaps, is the fact that over the last 15 years, the active-combat sniping record has been broken four times, and three of those have been by Canadians. \n \n That\u2019s no coincidence, says Furlong, who now runs a marksmanship academy in Edmonton. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve been saying this forever,\u201d he tells Maclean\u2019s by telephone. \u201cCanadian snipers are the best in the world. The sniper training program has been around for a long time. It\u2019s the foundation, and it\u2019s been retooled from lessons learned in Afghanistan. We\u2019ve built it to be the best.\u201d \n \n This latest record, Furlong adds, has taken sniping \u201cto a different level.\u201d Canadian snipers are considered some of the best in the world in part because they are not simply taught to hit their targets. Like much of the Canadian military, many are trained with skills above their existing rank, in the sniper\u2019s case as Unit Master Snipers, meaning they have the skills to design and run complex operations if the need ever arises. That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill. \n \n The practice of equipping soldiers with more than the skills they will need on the battlefield has served the Canadian military well. In Afghanistan, the results were clear. Maclean\u2019s witnessed firsthand how soldiers out on patrol, sometimes for days in enemy territory, operated as closely knit teams. Command decisions were made with input from different ranks, offering multiple perspectives to patrol commanders. \n \n The level of training Canada provides its soldiers, particularly its elite JTF2 commandos, is the driving force behind Canada\u2019s reputation for fielding a highly skilled and intellectually capable military. \n \n \u201cThis is a very important point,\u201d says Chris Kilford, a retired Canadian artillery officer and now a fellow at the Queen\u2019s University Centre for International and Defence Policy. \u201cI have been very impressed with the young people in our special forces that I have interacted with overseas. Corporals and master corporals: bright and articulate. I also think that in general our people are often capable of working at a higher level than the rank on their shoulder.\u201d \n \n Furlong agrees, adding that Canadian soldiers are more \u201ccross-trained\u201d than many other soldiers in the world, and Canada\u2019s snipers specifically are given every opportunity to pursue leadership training that refines their mental capabilities, a key component to the psychologically demanding job they do. \n \n Still, there are the naysayers. Warrant Officer Oliver Cromwell, an instructor at the infantry school at CFB Gagetown in New Brunswick* who has taught sniper courses, cautions that more information is needed before the 3,450 meter distance is confirmed. \n \n \u201cThere is a difference between slant angle range and true range,\u201d he says. \u201cSlant angle range\u2014if the shooter is at an elevated position relative to the target\u2014may appear longer that the true range, sometimes twice the true distance. I don\u2019t want to be a naysayer but those are just the facts.\u201d \n \n Some online message boards have have also questioned the validity of the new record. In one case a contributor to a military discussion suggested the sniper likely fired into a crowd of ISIS fighters and happened to hit one. \n \n But Furlong points out that these types of distances, 3,000 metres and more, are regularly achieved on the shooting range. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not an impossible distance,\u201d he says. \u201cThe difference is between a shooting range and a battlefield. They are two completely different environments. The pressure these guys are under is huge. So to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.\u201d \n \n As for the men who accomplished it\u2014snipers work in pairs, including a spotter\u2014Furlong says they probably didn\u2019t realize what they had done until later. \u201cWhen we broke the record, we didn\u2019t know until we got back to base,\u201d he says. \u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t really care, neither when I broke it or when mine was broken. Records are made to be broken.\u201d \n \n Still, unless there are major advances in equipment, Furlong adds, this one should stand for a long time. \n \n CORRECTION, June 29, 2017: This story originally stated the location of CFB Gagetown. Maclean\u2019s regrets the error. ||||| A Canadian sniper working alongside Iraqi forces in their fight against ISIS successfully struck a member of the militant group from a distance of 3,540 metres, Canada's military confirmed Thursday. \n \n The sniper is a member of the elite Joint Task Force 2 special forces unit, but citing operation security the military provided no details about how or when the incident took place. \n \n The Globe and Mail first reported the sniper record Thursday and quoted unnamed military sources who said the kill shot disrupted an ISIS attack on Iraqi security forces. \n \n The shot surpasses the previous record held by a British soldier, who in 2009 shot a Taliban fighter in Afghanistan from a distance of 2,475 metres. \n \n 'Force multipliers' \n \n Jody Mitic, a former Canadian sniper who now serves as an Ottawa city councillor, said he had heard rumours of the Canadian's record-breaking feat and describes it as \"a hell of a shot.\" \n \n Mitic said to hit a target at that distance, the sniper team, likely a shooter and spotter, would have to take every possible factor into account, from the temperature of the weapon and ammunition to the curvature of the Earth. \n \n \"The shooter and the spotter know exactly what they're doing,\" Mitic said. But \"at the end of the day, long-range shooting, it's your best guess.\" \n \n \"There's so much that goes into this, but at the same time, when you're in that environment, operating in that way, a lot of these things become second nature,\" Mitic said in an interview with CBC News. \n \n Jody Mitic, a former Canadian Forces sniper and now an Ottawa city councillor, says a long-distance shot must take many factors into consideration, and even then 'It's your best guess.' (CBC) \n \n Mitic, who was badly injured by a land mine in Afghanistan in 2007, expects the sniper team would have been working in the area for a while and would have known the conditions and terrain extremely well. He said teams like this have long been a vital part of Canada's military operations. \n \n \"We're called 'force multipliers,'\" Mitic said. \n \n \"If you have a well-trained, well-equipped group of snipers in an area, that frees up about a hundred other troops to go and do other things.\" \n \n Canadian sniper history \n \n Canadians have held the record for longest kill shot before. \n \n Former corporal Rob Furlong shot a Taliban fighter in Afghanistan in 2002 from a distance of 2,430 metres. He broke the record set just a few days earlier by another Canadian, former master corporal Aaron Perry, who shot an insurgent from a distance of 2,286 metres. \n \n The history of snipers in the Canadian military goes back much further.

Jonathan Vance revealed Canadian troops were operating inside Mosul. \n \n In a statement confirming the sniper's successful shot, the Canadian Forces insisted its mission in Iraq is still to merely \"advise and assist\" Iraqi forces. \n \n \"This takes the form of advice in planning for their operations and assistance to defeat Daesh [ISIS] through the use of coalition resources,\" the statement said. ||||| Canadian Sniper Hit A Target More Than 2 Miles Away, Military Confirms \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Dan Balilty/AP Dan Balilty/AP \n \n A sniper with Canada's elite special forces is being credited with making a world record shot, after the military confirmed Thursday that he hit a target from nearly 2.2 miles away during a recent operation in Iraq. \n \n Military sources tell Canada's The Globe and Mail newspaper that the sniper killed an ISIS insurgent during an attack on Iraqi security forces. \n \n \"The Canadian Special Operations Command can confirm that a member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,\" the force said in an email to NPR. \"For operational security reasons and to preserve the safety of our personnel and our Coalition partners, we will not discuss precise details on when and how this incident took place.\" \n \n The sniper reportedly fired from an elevated position; for the shot to be accurate, many factors \u2014 from wind and gravity to the Earth's curvature \u2014 would have to be taken into account. \n \n The shot easily surpasses the previous record for the longest confirmed sniper shot of 2,474 meters (1.54 miles), which was set by Britain's Craig Harrison in 2009. \n \n A source in the military tells the Globe and Mail that details of the shot were verified by video camera and other data, relying in part on information from a second location. \n \n \"The elite sniper was using a McMillan TAC-50 sniper rifle while firing from a high-rise during an operation that took place within the last month in Iraq,\" the paper reports. \"It took under 10 seconds to hit the target.\" \n \n Joint Task Force 2 is a specialized unit that was created in 1993, after the Canadian Armed Forces took over responsibility for federal counterterrorism operations. \n \n The special forces group says its mission is to protect \"the Canadian National Interest and combats terrorism at home and abroad.\" \n \n In Iraq, Canada's Special Operations Task Force says, its role is to share expertise with Iraq's military to help \"detect, identify and defeat (ISIS) activities from well behind the Iraqi security force front line in Mosul.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 An amazing, if grisly, feat continues to resonate after a report in Thursday's Globe and Mail of Toronto. The newspaper, quoting military sources, says a Canadian sniper in Iraq killed an ISIS militant from the mind-boggling distance of 3,540 meters, or 2.2 miles. The Canadian military has not confirmed what would be the longest kill shot by a sniper in history, but the story has in the meantime drawn attention to something else: the remarkable prowess of Canadian snipers in general. Some coverage: The training: If confirmed, that means the sniper record has been broken four times in the last 15 years, three of those times by Canadians, notes Maclean's magazine. One reason, it says, is because Canadian snipers \"are not simply taught to hit their targets.\" The training goes beyond their shooting duties, making sure they're able to \"design and run complex operations\" if necessary. \"That in itself may not make them better snipers but the gestalt of sniper-training and command-thinking combined could explain their skill.\" Long history: The CBC examines the history of Canada's military marksmanship, noting that Cpl. Francis Pegahmagabow of the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion had 378 kills, making him deadliest sniper of World War I. A military historian says the skill carried into WWII. \"The best snipers were usually country boys who knew how to hunt.\" Official statement: The Canadian military has not confirmed the kill, but it did confirm the shot. \"A member of the Joint Task Force 2 successfully hit a target from 3,540 meters,\" it says in an email to NPR, adding that it won't divulge further details for troop safety. Really? The Globe and Mail says the shot was verified by video and data, but that hasn't emerged yet, and some are skeptical. The Washington Post talks to former US snipers who say that even seeing a human target would be difficult from that distance, even with advanced scopes. A theory floated by a former Marine shooter: \"A spotter with an advanced optical device was able to verbally walk the sniper onto the target and correct his aim.\u201d Yes: Canadian Cpl.

A critic: In a post at Stuff.co.nz, John Edens thinks the shot was possible, given high-tech gizmos to account for everything from wind speed to the curvature of the earth. Plus, the gun used, a McMillan TAC-50 rifle, employs a 50-caliber bullet the size of a \"large cigar.\" His beef, though, is with media coverage that he thinks glorifies war. \"It's an achievement to a point, but it's not really one humanity should be proud of.\"",

Wolff tells the story of a Canadian Special Operations Task Force member who managed to kill an ISIS insurgent with a shot from a distance of 3,540 feet, the CBC reports. That's more than double the distance of the previous military record, which was shot by a British sniper in Afghanistan in 2009. \"The difference is between a shooting range and a battlefield,\" Wolff writes. \"They are two completely different environments. The pressure these guys are under is huge. So to the naysayers I would just say, this can be done.\"",

    "document": "BILOXI, Miss.\u2014Even as pressure mounts on Newt Gingrich to drop out of the Republican presidential contest, the former House speaker is preparing to stick it out\u2014with a new short-term goal of keeping Mitt Romney from securing the nomination. \n \n After mustering no better than second place in Tuesday's GOP Primaries, but beating Mitt Romney in Alabama and Mississippi, Newt Gingrich tells supporters he has no intention of dropping out of the race. \n \n Mr. Gingrich faced crucial primary tests Tuesday in Alabama and Mississippi, states where he campaigned hard to jump-start his flagging campaign. He lost both to former Sen. Rick Santorum, though he appeared on track to finish a respectable second in both. Even if he had realized his dream of winning both, though, some Republican officials doubt that would have generated enough momentum to win the nomination. \n \n Still, Mr. Gingrich and his advisers say he isn't going anywhere. In a concession speech, Mr. Gingrich was gracious to Mr. Santorum, while calling the results an indictment of Mr. Romney, widely seen as the front-runner. \"I believe that after the primaries are over it will be obvious the so-called front-runner in fact didn't get there, and from that point we will be in a whole different conversation,\" Mr. Gingrich said. \n \n WSJ's Danny Yadron takes a look at presidential candidate Newt Gingrich's failed strategy to win primaries in Alabama and Mississippi and discusses his future in the campaign. AP Photo. \n \n As those remarks suggest, Mr. Gingrich and his campaign have embraced a new goal, which is to block Mr. Romney. \"He believes the long haul is to get enough delegates to stop Romney from getting the nomination before the convention,\" said campaign chairman Bob Walker, a former congressman. \"If Romney is stopped, I don't think he gets the nomination at the convention.\" \n \n And if the race can be pushed into the convention, Gingrich supporters say, any sense that the former Massachusetts governor is the inevitable nominee would be punctured. \n \n Still, there now will be pressure for Mr. Gingrich to clear the way for Mr. Santorum to be the single alternative to Mr. Romney. Conservative GOP activist Keith Appell, for instance, argued Tuesday night that Mr. Santorum \"has earned the opportunity to take on Romney in a two-man race.\" \n \n And Bill Armistead, chairman of the Alabama Republican party, said that \"just looking at the numbers, it's hard to see it coming out in [Mr. Gingrich's] favor.\" \n \n Besides the goal of pushing the party's decision into the convention, though, Mr. Gingrich has other reasons to be reluctant to abandon his campaign. He has grand political ambitions that didn't end with his tenure as House speaker in the 1990s. After years earning a lucrative living as a consultant, his friends say, Mr. Gingrich wants a final chapter in public life, and this is likely his last bid for public office. \"When you've been thinking about running for president for many years, and you've been running for a couple of years, what's three more weeks, or even three more months?\" said Kellyanne Conway, who does polling and strategy for the Gingrich campaign. \n \n At age 68, he isn't under the financial pressure a younger candidate might be. He was worth more than $6.5 million in 2010, according to his financial-disclosure form filed with the Federal Election Commission. \n \n \"There's not a lot to worry about from his perspective,\" said Rick Tyler, a strategist for Mr. Gingrich's super PAC, an outside political-action committee that is supporting his candidacy. \n \n Mr. Gingrich \"could retire to Hawaii, play golf in the morning, do [TV appearances] at three in the afternoon and go to dinner,\" Mr. Tyler said. Instead, though, he appears to be driven by a desire to fill what he sees as a \"historic\" moment, a sentiment he shares often on the stump. \n \n \"I want to be straightforward: I am a visionary,\" he told an Alabama crowd last week. \n \n As a result, Ralph Reed, a conservative activist who is head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, doesn't expect Mr. Gingrich to step away. \"As long as there is money in the bank account and gas in the bus, I expect Newt to keep going,\" he said. \"It's clearly a problem for Santorum, but it's a gift for Mitt because it prevents the kind of mano-a-mano contest between Romney and the non-Romney candidate.\" \n \n Getty Images Newt Gingrich addressed a Birmingham, Ala., country club on Tuesday. \n \n The biggest question for Mr. Gingrich, though, may be how long his campaign can afford to carry on. It spends most of what it takes in and still carries debt from earlier in the nomination fight, according to a person familiar with the matter. The operation reported carrying more than $1.7 million in debt at the end of January, according to the most recent available records. \n \n Yet the campaign recently moved its Georgia political director to Louisiana, which votes March 24. Earlier this week, it released a post-Tuesday campaign schedule that included stops in Illinois, which votes next Tuesday. It believes it has succeeded in preventing Mr. Romney from running away with the nomination and that it now has an opportunity in Texas, California, Maryland and North Carolina, which votes May 8. \n \n Those plans signal more confidence than a week ago, when Mr. Gingrich's spokesman, R.C. Hammond, told reporters multiple times that Mr. Gingrich needed to win both Alabama and Mississippi to remain credible. \n \n Mr. Walker essentially conceded that Mr. Gingrich would be hard-pressed to collect more delegates than Mr. Romney, but he rejected the argument that he should drop out of the race to allow conservatives opposed to Mr. Romney to consolidate behind Mr. Santorum. \"Both of us are accumulating delegates state by state that are not allowing Romney to be the inevitable candidate,\" said Mr. Walker. \n \n Write to Janet Hook at janet.hook@wsj.com and Danny Yadron at danny.yadron@wsj.com ||||| With back-to-back losses in the Deep South Tuesday night, Newt Gingrich suffered a third defeat: He lost any of the remaining logic behind his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination. \n \n His claims to primacy in the South after winning the South Carolina and Georgia primaries evaporated with losses in both Mississippi and Alabama. \n \n Adding to the sting? The former House speaker who used to represent the Atlanta suburbs in Congress lost both to Rick Santorum, a former senator from the North - Pennsylvania. \n \n In addition, the fig leaf Gingrich has claimed as the target of relentless and excessive negative advertising from rival Mitt Romney dissolved as Santorum started to win contests and he himself became the target of the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s wrath. \n \n Santorum has shown an ability to win in spite of it, not lose because of it. \n \n That leaves the final argument Gingrich has made: that he is the conservative alternative to the \u201cMassachusetts moderate\u201d he has branded Romney. \n \n A string of wins not just in the South but also the Midwest has lent credence to Santorum\u2019s claim that, rather, he is the true right-wing alternative to Romney. \n \n It also buttresses his argument that he could fare even better in his quest for the nomination if Gingrich quit the race so he could go head-to-head with frontrunner. \n \n Even before the polls closed, Gingrich was portending primary disaster, with his staff issuing a memorandum offering a preemptive justification for him remaining a candidate should he lose both of the evening\u2019s contests. \n \n Senior Adviser Randy Evans and Political Director Martin Baker argued that \u201cGingrich is well positioned to win the GOP nomination.\u201d \n \n They noted that heading into Louisiana, only states with a total of 1,141 possible delegates will have voted - short itself of the 1,144 needed for the nomination. \n \n \u201cThe sequencing and pace of the second half favors Newt. When this process started, Newt\u2019s team had two goals: block an early Romney nomination; and plan for a sequenced and paced second half. Newt stopped Romney in South Carolina and subsequently weathered a multi-million dollar barrage of attacks in Florida, surviving to win in Georgia on Super Tuesday,\u201d wrote Evans and Baker. \n \n \u201cHere is the bottom-line reality: this nomination will not be decided until the fourth quarter \u2013 and that is not until June. It also means that the candidate who closes strongest in this race is going to win,\u201d they added. \u201cSo buckle up. This race is not going to be won or lost over backroom deals or endless and mind-numbing discussions in the media over delegate counts.\u201d \n \n The campaign also tried to dispel the ongoing speculation about his candidacy ending by issuing a schedule with seven stops in Illinois between today and Thursday. \n \n Gingrich himself told his supporters in a non-concession speech: \u201cIf you\u2019re the frontrunner and you keep coming in third, you\u2019re not much of a frontrunner.\u201d \n \n The Gingrich campaign wasn\u2019t the only one with overly optimistic expectations for Tuesday. \n \n Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor and onetime GOP candidate who now supports Romney, told CNN: \u201cThe resilience of Mitt Romney is starting to show through. When he was way behind in Florida, he came back and beat Newt Gingrich. When he was behind in Ohio, he came back and beat Rick Santorum. The same in Michigan and some other places.\u201d \n \n He added: \u201cI mean if Mitt Romney does well in those Southern states tonight, the script gets rewritten. I mean that\u2019s a breakthrough moment.\u201d \n \n The candidate himself was strident. \n \n \u201cSenator Santorum is at the desperate end of his campaign,\u201d Romney told CNN. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s far behind in the delegate count. He\u2019s far behind in the popular vote count. If you look at the math of how many delegates he\u2019d have to win to become the nominee, it\u2019s a very difficult road for him.\u201d \n \n In a statement after the results were in, Romney said: \u201cI am pleased that we will be increasing our delegate count in a very substantial way after tonight. Ann and I made a lot of new friends in Alabama and Mississippi and we look forward to campaigning in those states in the general election.\u201d \n \n Senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom told CNN that Romney\u2019s goal was not to win an \u201caway game\u201d in the South, but to secure one-third of the delegates up for grabs Tuesday. \n \n Doing so, he argued, would maintain a status quo in the overall campaign standings. \n \n \u201cLook, this is a delegate contest,\u201d said Fehrnstrom. \u201cOnce the dust clears, you\u2019ll be able to look and see that there really will be no ground that our opponents have made up against Mitt Romney.\u201d \n \n Santorum scoffed at that assessment through the day and during his victory remarks Tuesday night in Lafayette, La., where he had pre-positioned in anticipation of that state\u2019s primary next week. \n \n \u201cWell, for someone who thinks this race is inevitable, he spent a whole lot of money against me for being inevitable,\u201d Santorum said in a shot at Romney. \n \n He added that he would \u201ccompete everywhere,\u201d and said: \u201cThe time is now for conservatives to pull together.\u201d \n \n The former senator argues that he is the conservative of choice because he can compete against President Obama on all issues, including health care, where he says Romney will falter because he signed a universal health care law in Massachusetts that was the model for Obama\u2019s federal plan. \n \n The fourth and final candidate in the race, Representative Ron Paul of Texas, exceeds even Gingrich in being a longshot for the nomination. \n \n Through Tuesday night, he continues to be the only candidate who has not won either a primary or a caucus. \n \n He largely skipped the South, despite being a Texan, and instead is concentrating on the Illinois primary next week. \n \n His campaign touted a rally he is holding today with over 1,000 voters at the University of Illinois in Champaign, Ill. \n \n As impressive as that number may be, though, if it doesn\u2019t translate into votes, it won\u2019t help him advance toward the goal he, Gingrich, and the others share: being elected president of the United States. \n \n Glen Johnson can be reached at johnson@globe.com.

The former House speaker fell short in the heart of Dixie on Tuesday, and it's not clear where he goes from here. \n \n Approaching the halfway mark of the primary season, Gingrich has finished first in a grand total of two states: South Carolina and his home state of Georgia. \n \n Geographically, bright red Alabama and Mississippi were virtual home turf for the former speaker -- two must-win states for him to at least claim the title of regional powerhouse. \n \n Compared to South Carolina and Georgia, however, there was a clear, critical decline in Gingrich's support among several key groups on Tuesday. \n \n Among self-described very conservative voters, Gingrich won 33% of the vote in Mississippi and 37% in Alabama. In South Carolina and Georgia, he won 48% and 53%. \n \n Among evangelical or born-again voters, Gingrich won 30% of the vote in Mississippi and 31% in Alabama. In South Carolina and Georgia, he won 44% and 50%. \n \n JUST WATCHED Gingrich could face pressure to bow out Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Gingrich adviser on Santorum success 01:35 \n \n Among strong tea party supporters, Gingrich won 34% of the vote in Mississippi and 38% in Alabama. In South Carolina and Georgia, he won 48% and 55%. \n \n Similar declines among all three voting blocs occurred in comparison to the Florida Panhandle -- a traditional Deep South region. Gingrich narrowly won the Panhandle during the Sunshine State's January 31 primary, according to exit polls. \n \n Last week, Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond said the former speaker had to win Alabama and Mississippi in order to remain viable. Gingrich later asserted that he's going on to the national convention in Tampa no matter what happens. \n \n Bravado aside, at some point the money dries up and voters stop listening. For Gingrich, that point may have come Tuesday night. \n \n \"If (Gingrich) can't win in the South, he needs to go,\" said Erick Erickson, editor-in-chief of the conservative RedState.org. \n \n If Gingrich does go, Santorum will get the one-on-one challenge to Mitt Romney he's been all but pleading for. Romney told CNN Tuesday afternoon that Santorum is facing a \"desperate end\" to his campaign. Santorum's big wins on Tuesday night indicate that end is anything but nigh. \n \n \"It's just the beginning,\" Santorum spokesman Hogan Gidley said. \n \n \"This is a grassroots campaign for president,\" Santorum told a group of supporters in Louisiana Tuesday night. It's managing to \"defy the odds day in and day out.\" \n \n This race has now become an arduous delegate slog. The first man to claw his way to a bare majority of 1,144 wins. Heading into Tuesday, Romney had 459 delegates, Santorum had 203, and Gingrich had 118, according to CNN estimates. Ron Paul trailed badly, with 66 delegates. \n \n Prior to Tuesday, Romney needed to win roughly 48% of the remaining delegates to go over the top. Santorum needed about 66% of the remaining delegates, and Gingrich needed 72%. \n \n Given the calendar and the GOP's rules regarding the proportional allocation of delegates, it's tough to see a scenario under which anyone overtakes Romney. Santorum, Romney, and Gingrich each won roughly a third of the combined delegates at stake in Mississippi and Alabama. \n \n Realistically, the name of the game for Santorum -- and Gingrich if he goes on -- is to prevent Romney from hitting the 1,144-delegate mark and push for a contested convention when the Republicans meet in Tampa in August. \n \n Can it be done? Most analysts still expect Romney to eventually seal the deal in May or June, but the GOP's conservative base continues, on the whole, to be remarkably resistant to calls to fall in line behind the frontrunner. \n \n \"If we go to a convention, we would be signaling our doom in terms of replacing President Obama,\" Romney told Fox News earlier this week. \"That will not happen.\" \n \n There hasn't been a seriously contested convention since Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan battled down to the bitter end 36 years ago. The odds of another contested convention are long, but the game of presidential politics is anything but predictable.",

But now the 36-year-old woman is set to travel 2,700 miles to Mumbai for potentially lifesaving surgery. Abd El Aty weighs about 1,100 pounds, according to her family. \n \n At that weight, Abd El Aty would be the heaviest woman alive by roughly 450 pounds, and close to the heaviest woman ever to live. (At her heaviest, Michigan woman Carol Yager weighed 1,189 pounds, according to a 1993 Associated Press report.) \n \n Muffazal Lakdawala, a bariatric surgeon at the Center for Obesity and Digestive Surgery in Mumbai, will operate on Abd El Aty. The doctor has performed the most single-incision laparoscopic surgeries (a minimally invasive procedure that relies on video cameras threaded into the body) in the world, according to his bio on the medical center\u2019s website. The Times of India reported that Lakdawala has operated on high-ranking Indian politicians, including two ministers in Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s cabinet. \n \n Lakdawala told The Washington Post he has operated on patients above 660 pounds before, but Abd El Aty\u2019s surgery will be \u201cvery high risk.\u201d \n \n Abd El Aty\u2019s sister contacted Lakdawala after Egyptian doctors determined there was little they could do for the bedridden woman. When Lakdawala received her photograph, as the surgeon told The Post by phone early Thursday, he was stunned. \n \n \u201cMy initial reaction was \u2018How is she even alive?\u2019\u201d Lakdawala said. But he was determined to help. \u201cIf I can somehow use whatever God-gifted talent I have to save her,\u201d he said, \u201cI must try.\u201d \n \n To operate on patients with extreme weights, even transportation is an obstacle. In 2014, a crane was required to move the then-heaviest man in the world, Manuel Uribe, to a hospital. Taking Abd El Aty out of her home will probably require the demolition of a wall in her room, Lakdawala said. \n \n And Abd El Aty\u2019s case has already faced hurdles. Getting a visa from the Indian Embassy in Cairo threatened to halt Abd El Aty\u2019s voyage, because it required visiting the embassy for fingerprinting. So Lakdawala petitioned Sushma Swaraj, India\u2019s Minister of External Affairs, on Twitter. Abd El Aty received her medical visa shortly thereafter. The doctor said he is now communicating with commercial airlines to find a plane with an entrance that can accommodate Abd El Aty. He anticipates she will fly to Mumbai within a week to 10 days. \n \n As for the medical procedure itself, which Lakdawala said he is performing pro bono, he does not know yet exactly what he will do. Abd El Aty\u2019s medical records are sparse. But he thinks the weight-loss surgery will help her lose at least 200 to 300 pounds. \n \n He also anticipates Abd El Aty will need to remain in Mumbai for months as she recovers. \u201cIn every sense, she\u2019s a challenge,\u201d Lakdawala said. \u201cThis is a challenge not just for my skill set but for my team.\u201d \n \n More from Morning Mix: \n \n \u2018You cannot touch me there\u2019: Breast cancer patient claims TSA \u2018humiliated\u2019 and \u2018violated\u2019 her \n \n Tragedy at Turn-About Ranch: A teen came for rehab, then killed a staffer to escape, police say \n \n 22 heavily armed men post mannequin challenge on Facebook, much to delight of cops ||||| An Egyptian woman, believed to be the world's heaviest woman at 500kg (1,102lb), will soon be flown to India for weight reduction surgery. \n \n Eman Ahmed Abd El Aty, 36, will be flown on a chartered plane to Mumbai where bariatric surgeon Dr Muffazal Lakdawala plans to operate. \n \n The Indian embassy in Cairo initially denied her visa request as she was unable to travel there in person. \n \n After the surgeon tweeted to India's foreign minister that changed. \n \n India's External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, who is herself in hospital awaiting a kidney transplant, was quick to respond with an offer of help. \n \n Ms Abd El Aty's family says she hasn't been able to leave home for 25 years now and claims she weighs 500kg. \n \n If the claim about her weight is true, then that would make her the world's heaviest woman alive as the current Guinness record holder is Pauline Potter of the United States who weighed 292kg (643lb) in 2010. \n \n Dr Lakdawala, who has performed weight reduction surgeries on Indian minister Nitin Gadkari and Venkaiah Naidu, told the BBC that from looking at Ms Abd El Aty's medical reports and photographs, he believes that she weighs at least 450kg. \n \n Ms Abd El Aty's family says she weighed 5kg (11lb) at birth and was diagnosed with elephantiasis, a condition in which a limb or other body parts swell due to a parasitic infection, Dr Lakdawala told the BBC in a phone call from Mumbai. \n \n \"They said when she was 11, she had gained immense weight because of which she could not stand up and would crawl. \n \n \"And then she suffered a stroke which left her bedridden and she has not been able to leave home since then.\" \n \n Ms Abd El Aty is cared for by her mother and sister. \n \n Dr Lakdawala said Ms Abd El Aty's sister got in touch with him in October and he began raising money to bring her over to Mumbai as her family was too poor and unable to bear the costs of chartering a flight. \n \n \"We are expecting to fly her to Mumbai next week as soon as the formalities are over,\" he said. \n \n Dr Lakdawala believes that Ms Abd El Aty does not have elephantiasis, but suffers from obesity-related lymphoedema which causes gigantic swelling of legs. \n \n \"She would need to remain in Mumbai for two to three months for the surgery and treatment after which she would be able to return home, but it would take two to three years to bring her body weight under 100kg,\" the surgeon said. \n \n \"I'm hopeful that I will be able to help her, I won't say I'm confident because I think that would be an exaggeration,\" he added. \n \n What is bariatric surgery? \n \n Bariatric surgery, also known as weight loss surgery, is used as a last resort to treat people who are dangerously obese and carrying an excessive amount of body fat. \n \n In the UK, this type of surgery is available on the NHS only to treat people with potentially life-threatening obesity when other treatments have not worked. \n \n Around 8,000 people a year in the UK currently receive the treatment. \n \n The two most common types of weight loss surgery are: \n \n Gastric band, where a band is used to reduce the size of the stomach so a smaller amount of food is required to make someone feel full \n \n Gastric bypass, where the digestive system is re-routed past most of the stomach so less food is digested to make someone feel full \n \n Where are you on the global fat scale? ||||| Embassy in Cairo called Visa granted.Thank you so much for this prompt response,impressed Appreciate the help @SushmaSwaraj @CODSIndia01 \u2014 Dr Muffi Lakdawala (@DrMuffi) December 6, 2016 \n \n Ma'am , Eman Ahmed (Egypt) 500kgs requested me 2 save her pls help me get her a medical visa as refused thru normal process @SushmaSwaraj pic.twitter.com/93Fwz6m8iL \u2014 Dr Muffi Lakdawala (@DrMuffi) December 5, 2016 \n \n Now starts my tough journey to give this girl a second chance at life .

Thanks to her, Iman will now be in Mumbai by next week,\" said Dr Muffazal Lakdawala to a medical news web site, referring to the Egyptian, Iman Ahmad Abdulati, who weighs 500 kgs.Swaraj made sure the medical visa went through in under 24 hours, after the doctor tweeted her that the Indian embassy in Cairo had refused to give a visa to Abdulati who is unable to move from her Alexandria residence and travel to Cairo.Abdulati will now be airlifted to Mumbai for surgery in a specially arranged chartered flight, said the medical news website My Medical Mantra.\"For 20 years, she didn't step out of her house. Her family had tried many doctors there for medical help but were denied. It was her sister who got in touch with me after she heard of me from a family friend, (on) whom I had operated for obesity,\" Lakdawala told My Medical Mantra.Iman's sister Chaymaa' got in touch with Dr Lakdawala in October. He is a renowned obesity surgeon who has had several ministers as patients, including Union ministers Nitin Gadkari and Venkaiah Naidu Physicians in Egypt told Al Arabiya.net web site last month that Abdulati suffers from a disruption of the glands as well as from a parasite called elephantiasis. The former causes her body to store huge amounts of water and the latter causes extreme swelling. The combination of these two things has meant a huge amount of excess weight.After Abdulati's family sent Dr Lakdawala all her medical reports, he started sending requests for monetary help to his friends.\"The family is poor and cannot afford the cost of a private chartered flight to Mumbai from Cairo. While we asked the family to make her passport and arrange for visa, I started collecting funds,\" said Lakdawala to My Medical Mantra.Still, having managed to collect funds and made travel arrangements for Abdulati, her family and the doctor faced another unexpected obstacle - a visa for Abdulati to travel to India.\"It was like a roadblock for us. Embassy refused to budge and we needed visa for her to fly to Mumbai,\" Lakdawala said.That's when he tweeted minister Swaraj.Sitting in her hospital room, Swaraj replied promptly.The 36-year-old Abdulati has not left her house since she tipped the scales at 500 kg, almost 25 years ago, when she was 11 years old. Now, Abdulati gets to come to Mumbai where Dr. Lakdawala will operate on her at the hospital he founded, the Centre for Obesity and Digestive Surgery.For Dr Lakdawala, the journey only really begins now.",

(Associated Press) \n \n The pilots made history Thursday, first matching and then surpassing the 5,209-mile (8,383-kilometer) official world distance record for human flight in a gas balloon. Their next milestone is a 1978 duration record of 137 hours, 5 minutes and 50 seconds in the air in a traditional gas balloon \u2014 a mark that's considered the \"holy grail\" of ballooning achievements. The Two Eagles team expected to surpass that Friday morning. \n \n They hope to land Saturday somewhere on the peninsula of Baja California, where volunteer chase crews were being organized to help with the landing. \n \n The balloon team originally planned to cross into North America in Canada but shifted the plans because of changing weather. They are now catching a wind pattern that will take them south toward Mexico. \n \n The balloon was about 400 miles northwest of San Francisco when it hit the distance mark. Everyone inside the control room had their smartphones pointed at the screen to document the moment. \n \n \"There it is! There it is!\" shouted team members at the flight's mission control in Albuquerque as a giant screen showed the helium-filled Two Eagles balloon passing the record set by the Double Eagle V in 1981. \n \n In a matter of hours, they hit another milestone in similar fashion when they reached the 5,260-mile mark. That's the distance \u2014 1 percent more than the current record \u2014 they needed to meet in their quest to establish a record under international aviation rules. \n \n The distance still has to be confirmed by the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, a process that can take weeks. \n \n \"We're not taking any time to celebrate,\" said Steve Shope, head of mission control. \"We have a lot of work we have to do, and we're just taking this flight one hour at a time.\" \n \n The Two Eagles pilots, Troy Bradley of Albuquerque and Leonid Tiukhtyaev of Russia, are aiming to set both distance and duration records with their flight from Saga, Japan, which began shortly before 6:30 a.m. Sunday Japan time. \n \n The duration record was set in 1978 when Ben Abruzzo, Maxie Anderson and Larry Newman made the first trans-Atlantic balloon flight. \n \n The pilots had been aiming for Canada until a high-pressure ridge formed off the U.S. West Coast, forcing a sweeping right turn toward Mexico, where they now plan to land on Saturday. \n \n The shifting weather patterns resulted in a flurry of decision-making that made for a hard night for the pilots and mission control. Shope said the pilots were in better spirits Thursday after getting some sleep, but he acknowledged that being on oxygen for that many days and the high altitude can take a physical toll. \n \n Because weather conditions vary at different altitudes, the pilots traded speed and altitude throughout Thursday so the balloon would track to the south. \n \n \"It's a pretty sophisticated dance up there,\" said Ray Bair, a member of the mission control team. \n \n The balloon is outfitted with an array of monitors and other instruments that are tracking its course and compiling data to be submitted to the record-keepers.

Two balloonists crossing over the Pacific Ocean from Japan surpassed a distance record on Thursday for gas-filled balloon travel and are heading toward a landing in Mexico's Baja California in two days, officials said. \n \n Balloon Pilots Troy Bradley, an American, and Leonid Tiukhtyaev, a Russian, who are collectively dubbed \"Two Eagles\" had traveled more than 5,260 miles (8,465 km) by Thursday afternoon, according to a tracking website set up for their journey. \n \n They have surpassed the distance record of 5,209 miles (8,383 km) for gas balloons set on the only previous manned trans-Pacific flight, in 1981. The pilots are more than 250 miles (400 km) west-northwest of San Francisco, California. \n \n When they eclipsed the distance record, a round of applause broke out in the mission control room at the Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum in New Mexico and people there posed for pictures with the mile counter, said Art Lloyd Jr, a mission support control worker at the site. \n \n \"We're really excited and just now concentrating on getting them to a nice safe landing,\" Lloyd said. \n \n Meanwhile, the pilots who took off on Saturday from Japan are pursuing a flight duration record of 137 hours aloft set in 1978 by a team crossing the Atlantic. That is expected to happen on Friday morning, Lloyd said. \n \n The pilots are on track to land in Baja California, in Mexico, on Saturday, said officials with the Balloon Museum. \n \n The balloon, which relies solely on an enclosed chamber of helium gas for lift, is different from hot air balloons and so-called Roziere balloons, which rely on both hot air and lighter-than-air gas. Roziere balloons have by far the greatest range of the three types. \n \n Lloyd said the cramped conditions of the capsule has not affected the pilots, who have subsisted on a diet that includes fresh fruit, freeze-dried hikers' meals, beef jerky and the occasional hot meal from a small stove. They are equipped with cold weather gear including sleeping bags and a heater. \n \n They had earlier taken a track that would have brought them to southwestern Canada, but because of weather changes, they opted for the path toward Mexico, officials said. \n \n Their records must be officially certified by the National Aeronautic Association and the Federation Aeronautique Internationale, which can take months, a mission spokeswoman said. \n \n (Reporting by Joseph J.

But somehow the local town council wasn't aware. So when parks and rec workers saw the granite slabs \u2014 they thought they were part of a park bench that needed repair. They poured concrete into the ancient burial chamber, and topped it with a brand new picnic table. An environmental group realized the error and complained. The tomb is believed to be more than 6,000 years old, from the area's ancient Celtic settlers.\" \n \n An investigation into how the tomb came to be destroyed is underway, according to The Local, but it appears to be an open and shut case: Officials simply weren't aware the site existed \u2014 not even the town's mayor, Jos\u00e9 Luis Valladores. \n \n \"No one told me, neither Heritage nor the environmental group,\" he told the Spanish Huffington Post. \"The site wasn't even marked, and the logical thing would have been for them to get in contact with the local council so that we could have taken measures to protect the site,\" he added. \n \n Juan Barcel\u00f3, the archaeologist who called the mistake a monumental error, said he \"was horrified when he heard [the] news,\" and speculated that the breakdown in communication between builders and the local authorities was probably due to the summer holidays. \n \n He also told The Local that mistakes like this are not the norm. \n \n \"This is not representative of Spain, where monuments over 100 years old are all preserved by law,\" Barcel\u00f3 said. \"All authorities, national, state and local work effectively preserving our heritage. But sometimes accidents happen. I am sure that such disasters happen in many other countries, but have not been published.\" \n \n It turns out Barcel\u00f3 is partly right. Other countries have destroyed ancient remains, but usually it's done knowingly. \n \n In 2007, as The New York Times reports, \"a work crew in the ancient capital city of Nanjing unearthed and destroyed the burial sites of 10 noblemen from six dynasties.\" \n \n Just last year, according to archaeologists, an ancient Native American burial ground and village in California was discovered and then razed in order to make way for multimillion-dollar homes. \n \n However, the mistaken destruction of ancient relics isn't completely unheard of. \n \n In 2013, NPR's Scott Neuman wrote about workers destroying a 2,300-year-old Mayan pyramid in Belize to use the rubble for road repair. They were apparently unaware that the pyramid was a Mayan ruin. \n \n And then there are times when even the best intentions to preserve ancient relics go horribly awry, like this story from NPR's Eyder Peralta about a painter's attempt to restore a fresco.",

NPR reports the tomb is believed to have been built by Neolithic Celtic settlers in what is now the town of San Cristovo de Cea in Spain. After removing the granite slabs they thought had been parts of a bench, workers poured concrete into the burial chamber and topped it off with a picnic table. A Spanish archaeologist tells the Local he was \"horrified\" by the \"monumental error\" after an environmental group discovered what had happened in June. Town officials say they weren't aware the tomb was even there, despite it being listed as a heritage site. \"No one told me,\" the mayor tells El Huffington Post. \"The site wasn't even marked.\" But a regional government department is investigating the situation and tells the Local \"the town council was well aware of its existence.\" According to NPR, this kind of thing isn't unheard of. Two years ago, workers in Belize accidentally ruined a 2,300-year-old Mayan pyramid because they needed rubble to fix a road. But more often these ancient sites are destroyed on purpose. Last year, for example, developers dismantled a Native American burial ground in California to make room for some million-dollar homes.

For the uninitiated, a Moscow Mule has vodka, ginger beer, and lime, and thus is acidic, explains Live Science. The problem is, you're not supposed to serve acidic beverages in mugs with a copper interior because it raises the risk of copper leaching into the drink. Solution? A mug with a copper exterior is fine, but make sure the interior is made of stainless steel, nickel, or some other alternative. The advice isn't new, but the state felt compelled to issue the advisory given the \"recent popularity of Moscow Mules.\" (A cruise through Instagram proves the point.) Iowa's warning is based on an FDA advisory from a few years ago. Specifically, it says that drinks with a PH level of 6.0 or under should not be served in pure copper mugs, and the Mule falls into that category.

Not only that, but most bosses underestimate the time waste on phones to be closer to 39 minutes a day\u2014and workers younger than 35 are averaging a whopping 70 minutes of their day on their phones and 48 minutes on other personal matters. \"It's understandable that employees may occasionally use their mobile devices or attend to personal tasks during business hours,\" OfficeTeam's' district president says. \"But these activities can easily become big distractions.\" Fortune reports that most of the personal time on phones is spent on social media and non-work email; in distant third, fourth, and fifth places come sports sites, mobile gaming, and shopping. Beyond this, the survey found that 58% of office workers visit pages their company prohibits, but there's a breakdown between the sexes: 68% of men do this, compared to just 43% of women. (In the UK, some women get time off to cope with menstrual pain.)",

A survey from staffing firm OfficeTeam found the average office employee spends 56 minutes per day using their cell phone at work for non-work activity.

Personal email and social media made up the majority of the wasted time, with sports sites, mobile gaming, and shopping placing a far distant third, fourth, and fifth place, reports Time.

    "document": "\u2014 Shortly after security forces gunned down the last assailant involved in a brazen attack in Kabul Wednesday morning, officials said they believe the attackers were dressed as women to smuggle a huge stockpile of weapons into a building overlooking the U.S. Embassy and the NATO headquarters. \n \n The last of six assailants who launched rockets and sprayed the heavily secured compound with rifles for hours was gunned down at 8:30 a.m., police spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said. The attack, which exposed the vulnerability of the Afghan capital as U.S. forces begin to withdraw, began at 1:30 p.m. Tuesday and involved at least three suicide bombers who detonated explosives elsewhere in the city. \n \n Sediqqi said authorities found burqas \u2014 the blue garments worn by many Afghan woman that drapes them from head to toe \u2014 inside the van the assailants used to transport weapons into the building. \n \n \u201cWe strongly believe they used burqas to reach this place,\u201d Sediqqi said, speaking outside the building as reporters took photos of the six bodies of the assailants. \u201cThe police respect the women too much.\u201d \n \n Sediqqi said the siege ended only after Afghan and NATO special forces stormed the building Wednesday morning as NATO attack helicopters provided backup. \n \n NATO said six coalition \u201cpersonnel\u201d were wounded in the attack. A NATO spokesman, Lt. Col. Jimmie Cummings, said three of the troops were wounded Tuesday in a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) attack on the base. The other three were wounded while clearing the building overnight, he added. \n \n U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Ryan Crocker said Wednesday that the attack was likely carried out by the Haqanni network, a Taliban offshoot group that has been linked to some of the boldest attacks in the capital.The Taliban had claimed responsibility for the attack Tuesday. \n \n Crocker downplayed the significance of Tuesday\u2019s attack, which kept the capital under seige for nearly 20 hours. \n \n \u201cThese were five guys that rumbled into town with RPGs under their car seats,\u201d Crocker said. \u201cThis is not a very big deal, a hard day for the embassy and my staff, who behaved with enormous courage and dedication. But look, you know a dozen RPG rounds from 800 meters away \u2014 that isn\u2019t [the] Tet [offensive], that\u2019s harassment.\u201d \n \n Crocker said between six and seven rounds landed inside the embassy compound. He said he was heartened by the Afghan government\u2019s response to the attack and by what he described as a lately inconsequential attack. \n \n \u201cIf this is the best they can do, I find their lack of ability and capacity and the ability of Afghan forces to respond to it, actually encouraging,\u201d he said. \n \n Transition of responsibility for security from NATO to Afghan security forces \u201cwill proceed on pace,\u201d he added. \n \n Crocker spoke to a Wall Street Journal reporter Tuesday morning who was asked by the embassy to share a transcript of the interview with the rest of the Kabul press corps. \n \n Residents watched in horror as lightly armed police officers wearing no body armor fought assailants who fired rockets into diplomatic and military enclaves while holed up in an unoccupied building in what is perhaps the most secure part of the capital. \n \n The NATO headquarters and the embassy went on high alert after the initial blasts rang out Tuesday afternoon, with diplomats barricading themselves in bunkers. American attack helicopters had joined the fight, diving down to strike at the assailants. \n \n Kabul has seen its share of high-profile, chilling attacks this year, including recent strikes on the Intercontinental Hotel and the British Council. But the attack Tuesday was rich in symbolism in an impoverished country, scarred by years of war, where the United States has spent billions of dollars over the past decade in an elusive attempt to bring stability. \n \n To gain access to the unoccupied 15-story building that overlooks the sprawling diplomatic and military compounds, the assailants drove into the basement, then climbed to one of the top floors and took up positions behind cement pillars, Afghan authorities said. The building is under construction. \n \n The prolonged fighting around NATO\u2019s nerve center in Kabul, the headquarters for top U.S. commanders, exposed serious shortcomings in security and intelligence. Early reports suggested that at least seven Afghans were killed in the attack. \n \n A Taliban spokesman said the attack was intended to remind Afghanistan\u2019s government and the United States about the power the insurgents still wield. \u201cWe have not run out of patience, and we want to fight to end their occupation,\u201d said the spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid. \u201cWe have the ability to strike when we want.\u201d \n \n The Afghan government took formal control of security in a number of districts around Kabul this summer as part of a plan to gradually transfer responsibility from foreign to Afghan forces over the next three years. The first phase is seen as a key test of the competence of the U.S.-funded-and-trained Afghan forces, which the Obama administration hopes will be able to secure Afghanistan with little foreign help by the end of 2014. Kabul has effectively been under Afghan security control for several years. \n \n Afghan President Hamid Kar\u00adzai condemned the attack and vowed that it would \u201cembolden people\u2019s determination in taking the responsibility for their country\u2019s own affairs.\u201d To many Afghans, such condemnations have begun to ring hollow as the Afghanistan war nears its 10th year, with levels of violence rising and the prospect of a negotiated settlement appearing increasingly distant. \n \n \u201cThe government is too weak to protect us,\u201d said Ismail Agha, 38, who lives near the tall building from which the assailants launched the attack. \u201cThey should let us go after the terrorists and fight them ourselves.\u201d \n \n The attack Tuesday jolted expatriates, who have grown accustomed to sporadic violence in Kabul. \n \n Hamid M. Khan, a rule-of-law adviser in the Kabul office of the U.S. Institute of Peace, said he and his colleagues spent hours huddled in a safe room at their compound as blasts and gunshots thundered nearby at the site of the main attack. \n \n \u201cThe entire staff is hunkered down,\u201d he said, using BlackBerry Messenger to communicate. \u201cWe\u2019re very tense and alarmed by how close the rocket attacks and gunshots keep coming.\u201d \n \n At the World Bank office, a few blocks from the U.S. Embassy, more than 35 staffers were holed up in a basement bunker that had no bathroom or provisions. \n \n Elsewhere, as the clashes unfolded, Noorullah Mehirjoy, 60, a government worker, spent hours trying to find his young daughter, Zorah. \n \n She had been at a graduation ceremony, where Karzai was supposed to have awarded diplomas. But a security adviser approached the president soon after the first explosions were heard and whispered in his ear, Mehirjoy said. \n \n \u201cKarzai left the hall without saying goodbye,\u201d he said. \n \n In an interview last week, the new U.S. ambassador, Ryan C. Crocker, said he was pleasantly surprised by the situation in Kabul, having last been there in 2002. \n \n \u201cThe biggest problem in Kabul is traffic,\u201d said Crocker, who has noted that Afghanistan\u2019s problems are serious and will take a long time to solve. \n \n Special correspondent Sayed Salahuddin contributed to this report. ||||| Afghan authorities on Wednesday morning said the last of six attackers who laid siege to the U.S. Embassy and other buildings from a high-rise structure had been killed and the area was secure.The midmorning announcement by the Interior Ministry came nearly 21 hours after the start of the attack, raising troubling questions about why it took so long to secure the building under construction that the assailants used as a staging ground. From its upper floors, they rained rockets and gunfire on a heavily fortified enclave containing embassies, government buildings and the headquarters of the NATO force.At least seven Afghans were killed and 17 injured in the attack, which began just after the lunch hour Tuesday. No one was reported hurt or killed inside the U.S. Embassy or NATO headquarters, where hundreds of staff spent the night in bunkers.Throughout the night, sporadic gunfire could be heard as helicopters circled the building where the last of the assailants were holed up, clearing the structure floor by floor. Western troops provided aerial surveillance and other assistance but let Afghan police and soldiers take the lead in subduing the attackers.The Taliban claimed responsibility and said the American Embassy was the primary target. Insurgents texted updates to journalists throughout the attack.The audacious assault, the most serious against the embassy in the nearly 10-year war, was apparently meant to shake public confidence in the ability of the Afghan police and army to safeguard the country. The NATO force has begun handing over security responsibilities to Afghan troops, and American forces have begun a drawdown that will see the departure of 10,000 troops by the end of the year.The siege paralyzed central Kabul, with shops and businesses closing and government workers fleeing their offices. People living close to the site huddled in their homes, listening to explosions and heavy machine-gun fire throughout the night.Afghan authorities' investigation, already underway, is expected to focus on how the insurgents managed to smuggle so much weaponry into the center of the capital, penetrating a so-called \"ring of steel\" made up of Afghan police checkpoints. In some past attacks, the Taliban and affiliated groups have had help from members of the Afghan security forces.This was the third major attack in the capital in four months. Last month, insurgents besieged a British cultural center, and in June, teams of gunmen and bombers invaded a luxury high-rise hotel.Special correspondent Aimal Yaqubi contributed to this report.",

    "document": "Credit: (left) UZH; (right) 120/Creative Commons \n \n Europe's best-known mummy wasn't just a medical mess; he also had terrible teeth, according to a new study. \u00d6tzi (inset photo), a Stone Age man who died atop a glacier about 5300 years ago, suffered from severe gum disease and cavities. His teeth, back and front, were also heavily worn from chewing coarse grain and use as a \"third hand\" for gripping tools and cutting. When \u00d6tzi was discovered atop a glacier on the Austro-Italian border, his frozen corpse was intensively studied. But no one took a close look at his teeth until now. Using 3D computer tomography (a CAT scan), the hunter's mouth could be examined for clues as to the life he led. The results, published this week in the European Journal of Oral Sciences, suggest that \u00d6tzi didn't have it easy. A fall or other accident killed one of his front teeth, still discolored millennia later. And he may have had a small stone, gone unnoticed in his whole-grain bread or gruel, to thank for a broken molar. That gruel may be the culprit behind \u00d6tzi's cavities and gum disease, too. (An arrow on the right in CAT scan above marks places where the bone is eaten away by infection, the left arrow points at deep cavities.) In the late Stone Age, humans were increasingly incorporating coarsely ground grain into their diets. The uptick in starches, the researchers suggest, could explain the increasing frequency of cavities in teeth from the time\u2014a problem that's been with us ever since. \n \n \n \n See more ScienceShots. ||||| Few of our ancestors have been so thoroughly poked and prodded as Neolithic Tyrolean Iceman \"\u00d6tzi,\" discovered melting out of an Alpine glacier in 1991. Researchers have probed his stomach and bowels for traces of his last meal and analyzed his teeth for cavities. Now, an international team has sequenced his entire genome, and it turns out \u00d6tzi still has some surprises in store. \n \n Earlier computer scans had revealed \u00d6tzi's severe arteriosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries. But the new analysis shows that \u00d6tzi had a genetic predisposition to the condition, despite the fact that as a hunter-gatherer he had none of what are currently believed to be the relevant risk factors, such as being overweight, getting too little exercise, and smoking or drinking. \"This new data suggests that we might be less able to prevent arteriosclerosis than we believed,\" notes cardiologist and mummy expert Gregory Thomas of the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the new work. \n \n The whole genome sequencing also reveals more about \u00d6tzi's ancestors. Earlier research analyzed \u00d6tzi's mitochondrial DNA, which is inherited through only the female line, but had found few known matches among modern populations. Now sequencing of his Y chromosome places him in the rare G2A4 haplogroup, meaning that his paternal genes are linked to a population that left the Near East for Europe at the beginning of the Neolithic era, roughly 1000 years before \u00d6tzi himself lived. \n \n \u00d6tzi's genetic profile marks him as being most closely related to small populations currently living in the islands of Sardinia and Corsica, as well as some of the more remote areas of Georgia and Russia, says geneticist Angela Graefen of the Institute for Mummies and the Iceman in Bolzano, Italy, one of the principal researchers on the paper. That doesn't mean that \u00d6tzi was Sardinian or Corsican, Graefen notes, but that those populations may be the closest living genetic matches to the hunter-gatherers who originally migrated into Europe. \n \n The genome analysis, published this week in Nature Communications, also helps flesh out our picture of \u00d6tzi the man: Researchers now know he had brown eyes, brown hair, type-O blood, and shared the lactose intolerance that was then still the norm among Neolithic Europeans. He was also the first known carrier of Lyme disease: the sequencing yielded genes from the disease-causing Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium. Although scientists can't know whether Lyme disease actually made \u00d6tzi sick during his lifetime, the discovery of 60% of a B. burgdorferi genome from a Neolithic carrier shows that this pathogen has plagued humans for thousands of years. Until researchers compare the B. burgdorferi genome from \u00d6tzi with more modern incarnations of the pathogen, they won't have a clear picture of how Lyme disease evolves. \"But depending on the research other scientists are doing over the next few years, we could be gaining a lot more insights from \u00d6tzi's genome,\" Graefen says. \n \n The new paper adds to our knowledge of Neolithic life, says mummy expert Frank Ruehli of the University of Zurich in Switzerland. \"Of course \u00d6tzi is only one individual, but he's a very well-preserved, well-described individual, whom we have a lot of additional information about already. So this is an important step.\"",

Though his remains were discovered on the Austro-Italian border in 1991, his teeth had never been assessed.

What they determined, as translated from dental-speak (\"the poor periodontal condition of the Iceman's dentition, eg, loss of alveolar bone...\") by Science: a discolored front tooth as the result of some sort of accident, a broken molar, cavities, and gum disease.

Then it went a bit downhill. \n \n First, it was revealed he was using some of that money to fund a pro-Donald Trump trolling campaign, which led to Facebook removing him from public view. He didn't even turn up to his own company's developer's conference last year. \n \n And now, a jury has ruled that he broke a non-disclosure agreement that'll mean $500m in damages (unless Facebook wins on appeal). \n \n Mark Zuckerberg doesn't display many emotions - but you wonder what he'll be like behind closed doors on this one. \n \n As it stands, Palmer Luckey is still a Facebook employee, but what he's doing there is anyone's guess - the company won't even tell me his job title. \n \n Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg testified last month that \"the idea that Oculus products are based on someone else's technology is just wrong\". \n \n Zenimax, which owns id Software, a video games developer, was suing Facebook for $2bn. \n \n Along with the claims against Palmer Luckey, it alleged that John Carmack, co-founder of id, took intellectual property belonging to Zenimax when he left the firm to join Oculus as its full-time chief technology officer. \n \n 'Stellar quarter' \n \n Virtual reality is only a small part of Facebook's current business, but is seen as important to the firm's strategy over the next 10 years. \n \n Most of Facebook's fourth-quarter revenue - which jumped 54% to $27.6bn - came from adverts on its social network. \n \n \"Facebook had another stellar quarter, delivering record revenue, user growth and profitability, as it rides the shift of advertising to online,\" said Martin Garner, a senior analyst at CCS Insight. \n \n \"However it expects advertising growth to slow in 2017, so it expects to be less profitable this year.\" \n \n Fake news \n \n Other challenges that Facebook face this year include a changing approach to privacy in Europe, an uncertain business landscape in the US and challenges in China, Mr Garner said. \n \n The social network has also been widely criticised after some users complained that fake news on its platform had influenced the US presidential election. \n \n In a call with analysts on Wednesday, Facebook executives signalled it would tackle the problem through the use of more artificial intelligence. \n \n They also said many of Facebook's new users were in India, where telecoms operators had offered free data packages for Facebook traffic. \n \n For the full year, Facebook grew its net profit by 177% to $10.2bn. ||||| (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (FB.O) cruised past Wall Street\u2019s earnings and revenue expectations on Wednesday with strong growth in its mobile ad business, demonstrating that controversy over so-called \u201cfake news\u201d and inaccurate advertising measurements had little impact on its financial performance. \n \n With quarterly profit of $3.57 billion, more than double the $1.56 billion it reported a year ago, the company showed no signs of slowdown in growth. The results handily beat analysts\u2019 expectations, and shares ticked up about 0.2 percent in after-hours trading. \n \n The company had warned in November that ad growth would likely slow \u201cmeaningfully\u201d due to limits on ad load - the total number of ads Facebook can show to each user. But there was little sign of that in the fourth quarter as total revenue soared to $8.81 billion from $5.84 billion a year ago. \n \n \u201cI think the rate of growth will decline, but it will remain very high,\u201d said analyst Michael Pachter of Wedbush Securities. \u201cThey grew 57 percent in 2016, and our current model has \u2018only\u2019 38 percent revenue growth in 2017. That\u2019s still pretty impressive.\u201d \n \n Facebook suffered a slight setback just before the market close when a jury in Texas ordered Facebook, its virtual reality unit Oculus, and other defendants to pay a combined $500 million to ZeniMax Media Inc, a video game publisher, for violating a non-disclosure agreement. [nL1N1FM20U] \n \n But the company\u2019s core business continued to power ahead as mobile advertising accelerated; it now accounts for 84 percent of ad revenue, up from 80 percent a year ago. \n \n Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told analysts on a call on Wednesday that the company expects a major ramp-up in hiring and other spending during 2017 as it invests in video and other priorities. \n \n Zuckerberg said the focus would be on generating short-form, original videos, especially professionally created \u201cepisodic content\u201d produced week-to-week. \n \n Users should come to Facebook \u201cwhen they want to keep up-to-date on what\u2019s going on with their favorite show or what\u2019s going on with a public figure,\u201d he said. \n \n U.S. President Donald Trump used the service for that on Tuesday, when he broadcast his announcement of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch on Facebook Live. \n \n THREAT TO NETFLIX \n \n The video push could ultimately pose a threat not only to YouTube, owned by Alphabet Inc\u2019s (GOOGL.O) Google, but also to next-generation television companies like Netflix Inc (NFLX.O). \n \n The Facebook logo is displayed on their website in an illustration photo taken in Bordeaux, France, February 1, 2017. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau \n \n Facebook\u2019s strong performance could also throw a shadow on the expected Snap Inc initial public offering. Facebook competes with Snap chiefly through its Messenger service, and also with WhatsApp and Instagram. \n \n The various Facebook apps have all been adding features rapidly to attract more users and retain those already on the network, and some of those features are clearly aimed at Snap. \n \n Facebook has also been building new tools to stem the spread of fake news and partisan propaganda on the network, which emerged as a major issue in last year\u2019s U.S. presidential election. \n \n Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg played down the impact of U.S. election spending on the company\u2019s finances. She compared it to the soccer World Cup or the Super Bowl and said it was not a \u201ctop 10 vertical\u201d for the fourth quarter. \n \n \u201cNo one event is that big for our business,\u201d she said. \n \n USERS GROWING \n \n The company inched closer to reaching 2 billion users, saying that about 1.86 billion people were using its service monthly as of Dec. 31, up 17 percent from a year earlier. \n \n China apparently will not contribute to that growth any time soon, as Zuckerberg all but ruled out an imminent expansion in the world\u2019s most populous country. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re only going to do this in a way that we\u2019re comfortable with in the long term,\u201d he told analysts, adding that there would be \u201cno news at all in the near term.\u201d \n \n Mobile daily active users rose 23 percent to 1.15 billion, the company said. More than 90 percent of Facebook\u2019s users access the network through mobile devices. \n \n Facebook is expected to generate about $29.71 billion in mobile ad revenue in 2017, according to research firm eMarketer, up about 35.2 percent from 2016. \n \n Net income attributable to Facebook shareholders for the quarter rose to $3.56 billion, or $1.21 per share, from $1.56 billion, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier. \n \n A Facebook logo is displayed on the side of a tour bus in New York's financial district July 28, 2015. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo \n \n Excluding items, the company earned $1.41 per share. \n \n Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.31 per share on revenue of $8.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.",

Greg Gianforte's physical assault on a reporter at a Montana rally Thursday night. \n \n Interested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest \n \n \"No, that was a different league, a different world,\" Trump said on Friday when asked whether he regretted Thursday's comments -- made amid outrage he's expressed over the alleged murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. \n \n \"That was a tremendous success last night in Montana and Greg is a great person, he\u2019s a tough cookie, and I\u2019ll stay with that,\" Trump said, again offering praise for the congressman who body-slammed a reporter last year as he campaigned during a special election for Montana's at-large congressional seat. The incident was caught on audiotape. Gianforte went on to win the election and is now up for reelection. \n \n \"Any guy that can do a body slam, he is my type!\" Trump said to cheers Thursday night. \n \n Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images \n \n \"I was in Rome with leaders when I heard about it, and I heard that he body-slammed a reporter,\" Trump said. \n \n Trump said he was afraid Gianforte would lose after the moment, but then recalled, \"Wait a moment, I know Montana.\" \n \n Gianforte pleaded guilty and was sentenced to community service for the incident. He apologized on the night of his election victory, saying, \"When you make a mistake you have to own it.\" \n \n The White House Correspondents' Association has since come out to condemn the president comments. \n \n \"All Americans should recoil from the president's praise for a violent assault on a reporter doing his Constitutionally protected job. This amounts to the celebration of a crime by someone sworn to uphold our laws and an attack on the First Amendment by someone who has solemnly pledged to defend it. We should never shrug at the president cheerleading for a violent act targeting a free and independent news media,\" WHCA President Olivier Knox said in a statement. \n \n For Trump, the Montana Senate race is personal. \n \n Trump came to Montana on the attack against Tester, a two-term Democratic senator, who is in a close race against Matt Rosendale, the current state auditor. \n \n The president has made it his mission to unseat Tester, whose office publically released information about alleged misconduct that led to White House physician Adm.

A lot of reasons that caravan -- 4,000 people -- but I just want to thank the Mexican government because they\u2019re stopping it hopefully before it ever gets to Mexico,\u201d Trump said. \n \n \u201cAs you know, I\u2019m willing to send the military to defend our Southern border if necessary all because of the illegal immigration onslaught brought by the Democrats because they refuse to acknowledge or to change the laws -- they like it,\u201d Trump said. \n \n Trump said that the midterm elections will be \u201can election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order and common sense -- that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to be.\u201d \n \n Jonathan Ernst/Reuters \n \n At times, the president veered off script, talking about the first lady\u2019s trip to Africa and controversy over her pith hat (\u201cI think she bought it in Los Angeles!\u201d) and fake allegations he wears a toupee (\u201cHe wears a hairpiece\u201d). \n \n But then he would swerve back on course to talking about Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren\u2019s DNA test in a state home to many Indian reservations: \u201cIt\u2019s too bad because I can\u2019t call her Pocahontas anymore.\u201d \n \n While Trump comfortably won the Big Sky state by 20 points, Tester, a moderate Democrat, maintains a slight lead in what has become one of the most expensive political contests in the small state\u2019s history as millions of dollars have poured into Montana. It\u2019s the president\u2019s third trip to Montana, and Tester is only a few points ahead of Rosendale in recent polls. \n \n AP \n \n Tester has touted a bipartisan record in the Senate, even publishing a full-page newspaper ad at the beginning of the summer thanking the president for signing 16 of his bills into law on everything from government waste to veterans affairs. \n \n \u201cWe can\u2019t let Jon Tester and the radical liberal agenda win, they\u2019ll go after President Trump,\u201d Rosendale said. \n \n While the president\u2019s ire toward Tester is rooted in Jackson, many of the voters ABC News spoke with before the rally began didn't seem to know his name. \n \n \u201cI really don\u2019t have any thoughts about him,\u201d Jeffrey Stenger from Polson, Montana, told ABC News. \n \n His wife Lynn jumped in, to remind him he was the White House physician who \u201cgot in a spat with Tester.\u201d \n \n \u201cHe has a good instinct of reading people, even in the beginning of the election he called people out and said the truth.

(source: IANS) Ringing Bells had in mid-February this year planned to deliver 25 lakh units of Freedom 251 before June 30. (source: IANS) \n \n The world\u2019s cheapest smartphone at Rs 251 (less than $4) is here, finally. Its makers, the Noida-based startup Ringing Bells Pvt Ltd, say they have made it possible despite allegations from various quarters that such a phone would not see the light of the day. Even an FIR was lodged against the company. \n \n According to Ringing Bells\u2019 Founder and CEO Mohit Goel \u2014 sitting comfortably in his Sector 62 office here, the company has been able to keep its promise to consumers. \n \n \u201cWe are ready with nearly two lakh \u2018Freedom 251\u2019 handsets. We will start delivery from June 30,\u201d Goel said, adding that once he is done with this first phase of delivery (of two lakh phones), he will open registration again for those who wish to buy the handset. \n \n The company had in mid-February this year planned to deliver 25 lakh handsets before June 30. However, it received over seven crore registrations before its payment gateway crashed within three days. \n \n \u201cWe learned from our mistakes and decided to go silent till we come out with the product. Now we have a 4-inch, dual-SIM phone ready for delivery. I feel vindicated,\u201d he said in one breath. \n \n According to Goel, he is facing a loss of Rs 140-Rs 150 per unit, but hopes to make profit on volumes. \u201cWe will have a loss, but I am happy that the dream of connecting rural and poor Indians as part of the \u2018Digital India\u2019 and \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiatives has been fulfilled with \u2018Freedom 251\u2019,\u201d Goel said. \n \n The 3G device has a 1.3GHz quad-core processor, 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal memory and supports external memory cards of up to 32GB. No device was, however, given to IANS. Only a photograph was allowed to be taken. \n \n The company has offered an 8MP primary camera with flash, a 3.2MP front camera for selfie and a 1,800 mAh battery. It runs on Android 5.1 (Lollipop). The phone is available in two colours \u2014 black and white \u2014 with centrally aligned rear camera and branding on the back panel. It has a speaker just alongside the branding. \n \n The device displays the Indian Tricolour when you switch it on. The company has incorporated all the basic Google apps in the handset. \u201cOur devices are completely \u2018Make in India\u2019 and were manufactured at our Haridwar-based manufacturing unit. We plan to sell two lakh devices every month,\u201d he said. \n \n The company is also planning to launch a 32-inch high-definition LED television \u2014 also called \u201cFreedom\u201d \u2014 in the first week of July. \n \n \u201cThese will be the cheapest television sets in India and will be available for less than Rs 10,000. Within two days, the delivery would be made and we will sell them online,\u201d Goel said, adding that the company currently has one lakh such pieces in stock. \n \n In comparison, the cost of 32-inch HD LED TV sets normally begins from Rs 13,000. \n \n Ringing Bells launched \u201cFreedom 251\u201d in February in the presence of veteran BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi. It distributed some \u201cprototypes\u201d of the product to the media which turned out to be handsets from another domestic handset maker Adcom. \n \n However, the company maintained that the device had been developed \u201cwith immense support\u201d from the government. \n \n \u201cOur humble beginning to provide a high-tech gadget that will benefit all in the hinterland and bridge the huge gap that clearly exists between the metros and semi-urban/rural areas is in keeping with the government\u2019s initiatives,\u201d Ringing Bells President Ashok Chadha had earlier said. \n \n Doubts were raised over Ringing Bells\u2019 handset after some experts said no phone could be manufactured for less than Rs 2,000. \n \n For all the latest Technology News, download Indian Express App ||||| We\u2019re still not convinced it\u2019s not an elaborate scam, but the Freedom 251 \u2013 known globally as the \u201c$4 smartphone\u201d \u2013 will begin shipping to customers soon. At least that\u2019s what the CEO of the company that sells the device is promising. \n \n When Ringing Bells, an obscure company based in Noida, announced it would sell a real smartphone for just Rs. 251, consumers and media were almost universally skeptical. And rightly so, seeing that the \u201cprototype\u201d Freedom 251 units that Ringing Bells showed to the press were actually Adcom Ikon 4 units disguised with corrector fluid\u2026 \n \n Despite skepticism \u2013 and a police investigation \u2013 Ringing Bells pushed on with its plan and eventually gathered a whopping 70 million registrations for the device. The company said it would deliver the first 2.5 million units by the end of June. \n \n CEO Mohit Goel told IANS that Ringing Bells will only be able to deliver a fraction of what it promised \u2013 about 200,000 units will ship out starting on June 30. \n \n Goel said Ringing Bells would open a second phase of registrations for the Freedom 251 after it ships the first 200,000 units. It isn\u2019t clear why the company needs another registration round, given the massive number of registrations it received back in February. \n \n Despite not yet delivering on his initial promises, Goel considers that he already proved critics wrong: \n \n \u201cWe learned from our mistakes and decided to go silent till we come out with the product. Now we have a 4-inch, dual-SIM phone ready for delivery. I feel vindicated,\u201d he said. \n \n Ringing Bell plans to sell around 200,000 Freedom 251 every month, despite taking a Rs. 140-150 loss per unit. The company said it would partner with third-party developers to preload apps on the device, and, rather counterintuitively, hopes that it would reduce its losses once it ramps up shipments. \n \n Mohit Goel\u2019s dreams go beyond giving away smartphones. The Ringing Bell CEO said the company would introduce the cheapest television sets in India next month. But they won\u2019t be as cheap as the Freedom 251 \u2013 Ringing Bells\u2019 HD LCD TV set will reportedly cost Rs. 10,000. \n \n Has anyone here ordered the Freedom 251?

    "document": "Soon after the results of France's presidential election were announced Sunday, showing a clear victory for centrist Emmanuel Macron against the far-right Marine Le Pen, messages of congratulations began flooding in from leaders across the world. \n \n Across the EU, leaders breathed a sigh of relief as, in the wake of Brexit, French voters rejected the fiercely anti-Europe Le Pen \n \n \"Congratulations, @EmmanuelMacron. Your victory is a victory for a strong and united Europe and for French-German friendship,\" Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman said on Twitter. \n \n European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he was happy that the French had chosen a \"European future\", while EU Council President Donald Tusk also offered his congratulations, saying the French had chosen \"liberty, equality and fraternity\" and \"said no to the tyranny of fake news\". \n \n One of Macron's new responsibilities as French president will be negotiating the terms of Britain's exit from the EU along with the bloc's other leaders. \n \n That task looked like it had already begun Sunday night, with a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Theresa May saying she had called Macron to \"warmly congratulate him on his election victory\", adding that the two had \"briefly discussed Brexit and the Prime Minister reiterated that the UK wants a strong partnership with a secure and prosperous EU once we leave\". \n \n Across the Atlantic, US President Donald Trump also proffered his best wishes to the new French president. \n \n \"Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next President of France. I look very much forward to working with him!\" he wrote on Twitter. \n \n Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next President of France. I look very much forward to working with him! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) 7 mai 2017 \n \n His statement came despite Trump's ideologically similarities with Le Pen and the fact that he had earlier praised the National Front leader over her security policy. \n \n Before the first round of the election last month, he said a deadly attack against a police officer in Paris would have a \"big effect\" on the vote and said Le Pen was \"the strongest on what's been going on in France\". \n \n Hillary Clinton, Trump's defeated rival in last year's US presidential race, also reacted to Macron's victory on Twitter. \n \n Victory for Macron, for France, the EU, & the world. \n \n \n \n Defeat to those interfering w/democracy. (But the media says I can't talk about that) \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) 7 mai 2017 \n \n \"Victory for Macron, for France, the EU, & the world,\" she said. \n \n The White House on Sunday issued a formal statement congratulating \"Macron and the people of France on their successful presidential election\". \n \n Meanwhile, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is likely to have more in common with the progressive, liberal politics of Macron than the US president, and he was quick to telephone France's election winner on Sunday night. \n \n \"I look forward to working closely with President-elect Macron in the years ahead as we work together on a progressive agenda to promote international security, increase collaboration in science and technology, and create good, middle class jobs on both sides of the Atlantic,\" Trudeau said in a statement earlier. \n \n Congratulations @EmmanuelMacron! Let's meet soon, and keep working to grow & strengthen the deep ties between Canada and France. \u2014 Justin Trudeau (@JustinTrudeau) 7 mai 2017 \n \n Elsewhere, Brazil's President Michel Temer also congratulated Macron on Twitter, saying: \"Brazil and France will continue to work together for democracy, human rights, development, integration and peace.\" \n \n And Australia's prime minister hailed what he called an \"historic election win\". \n \n \"We will build even stronger ties between our two great nations,\" Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull tweeted. \n \n (FRANCE 24 with AFP, AP, REUTERS) \n \n Date created : 2017-05-08 ||||| When Emmanuel Macron chose to make his presidential victory speech to his supporters from the grand surroundings of the Louvre, he was sending a message about the style in which he intends to govern. The vast palace-turned-museum has, over centuries, stood for monarchy, empire and revolution: a mix of past glory and high culture with the modernity of a giant glass pyramid in its midst. \n \n Macron is en route to the Elys\u00e9e, but could find it hard to govern Read more \n \n France\u2019s youngest president has made two different promises for his leadership style. The 39-year-old has vowed to bring a youthful \u201crevolution\u201d to French politics but also to return to the historic tradition of a strong leader who can \u201cembody the nation\u201d. He believes that ever since King Louis XVI\u2019s head was chopped off in the revolution, France has been constantly trying to compensate for the lack of a true leader figure who could personify France. Macron, a centrist political novice, who had never before run for election and until three years ago was unknown, believes he can fill the role of republican guide of the nation. \n \n Macron\u2019s first public gesture as president was to deliberately, solemnly make a long walk alone under spotlights across the Louvre\u2019s Napoleon courtyard to Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy, the European anthem. It was a carefully coordinated reference to the style of the late Socialist president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, who presented himself as a kind of republican, elected monarch. \n \n Every new French leader wants to contrast the style of the president who went before. If the Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2013 who was once Macron\u2019s mentor \u2013 was a plodding \u201cordinary bloke\u201d who described himself as \u201cPresident Normal\u201d and turned his own door handles at the Elys\u00e9e instead of waiting for a butler, Macron wants to bring back what he styles as a lofty poise and distance. \n \n But Macron, who will take office within days, will have no state of grace. He is taking over a country exhausted by decades of mass unemployment, impatient with a stagnant economy, still living under a state of emergency, facing a constant terrorist threat and at war abroad \u2013 with troops still deployed across the Sahel region of Africa against jihadi groups. \n \n The election has highlighted a significant divide between rich and poor, between thriving, diverse cities and the far away de-industrialised peripheral areas and countryside. Millions chose the far right and the hard left in the two-round presidential race and many have reservations about Macron\u2019s pro-business economic project, fearing livelihoods are threatened by globalisation. He has to prove he can reach out beyond his own camp, particularly since a significant proportion of those who voted him into office did so to keep out the far right rather than adhere to his policy plans. \u201cHe\u2019s aware of the immense responsibility on his shoulders,\u201d several members of his team repeated. \n \n One of Macron\u2019s first moves will be to cut and streamline France\u2019s strict labour laws in favour of businesses. He has talked of using presidential decrees to push this through fast as soon as possible. But labour law changes were forced through by decree under Hollande and saw months of street demonstrations in 2016. Navigating the hangover from that social confrontation will be his first major challenge. \n \n Macron knows better than most that the first days of a French presidency can make or break an entire mandate. He was deputy chief of staff to the Socialist president Hollande, whose lack of preparation and dithering in the early days led to an unpopularity from which he was never able to recover. Macron is also aware of ill omens. He was on the newly elected Hollande\u2019s plane to Berlin to see Angela Merkel when it was hit by lightning \u2013 a metaphor for a tepid diplomatic relationship that did not fully recover. \n \n The pro-European Macron will make his first foreign leader visit to Merkel quickly. He is also expected to make an early trip to see French troops in Mali to signal that French international military engagement will continue. \n \n One of Macron\u2019s most-repeated promises has been \u201cefficiency\u201d of government. He wants to introduce new ethics rules for politicians, including an initiative against nepotism after the corruption investigations of the rightwing candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon and the investigations of Marine Le Pen\u2019s party funding during the presidential campaign. He also wants quickly to loosen red tape for small businesses and cut class sizes in primary schools in disadvantaged areas. \n \n But exactly how he will deliver his manifesto pledges depends on whom he appoints as prime minister and whether his fledgling \u201cneither right or left\u201d political movement En Marche! (On the Move!) can win a majority in the parliamentary elections in June. Without a majority, Macron\u2019s hands will be tied. The next six weeks of parliamentary campaigning will be crucial. \n \n There has never been so much secrecy surrounding who will be appointed French prime minister. Because the centrist Macron, who comes from no political party, needs to strike a balance between supporters from the left and right, he has kept quiet about who he will pick. He has said only that the prime minister must be \u201cstrong\u201d and politically experienced. Speculation has ranged from a centrist ex-minister such as Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou to ex-ministers from the political right or left, or the centrist MEP Sylvie Goulard, but it could also be an appointment from civil society. His 15-minister government will have a male-female balance, one-third of whom will be new to politics. \n \n \u201cWe need to do away with this political class, which is all too often made of men over 50 who never had a proper job,\u201d Macron has said, promising that his 577 parliamentary candidates will be half women and half political newcomers. \n \n But if he doesn\u2019t win a parliamentary majority, he will be plunged into horse-trading for a new type of coalition. He will need to be a very skilled politician to make it work and yet he says he hates politics and has little interest in it. \u201cBeing president of the Republic is not about loving politics, it\u2019s about taking care of the French,\u201d he has said, warning that previous presidents \u201cloved politics too much\u201d and that politics had become cut off from real people\u2019s lives. \n \n Becoming cut off has always been a risk for presidents who take over the gilded office at the grandiose Elys\u00e9e palace, where the silence is punctuated by the sound of gold clocks chiming and the view from the leader\u2019s desk is a vast expanse of manicured lawn behind high walls. \u201cOf course power isolates,\u201d Macron told an interviewer on the campaign trail, arguing that he would not let it happen to him. ||||| CLOSE Former secretary of State Condoleezza Rice warns against feeling reassured by the expected defeat of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election Sunday. USA TODAY \n \n Former secretary of State Condoleezza Rice (Photo: Jack Gruber, USAT) \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 Former secretary of State Condoleezza Rice warns against feeling reassured by the defeat of far-right candidate Marine Le Pen in the French presidential election Sunday. \n \n \"I really do believe that these populists are changing the character of the politics just by being there, so even mainstream candidates are having to respond to their agenda,\" Rice told Capital Download. \"You see fewer people talking about free trade. You see countries talking about industrial policy and protectionism. It's hard to defend immigrants almost any place in the world today. ... \n \n \"The rise of nativism is having an impact on the politics, even if the candidates aren't winning.\" \n \n More than four years ago, Rice began writing a book about the challenges to democracy, especially in nations that only recently have moved toward free elections. Now Democracy: Stories from the Long Road to Freedom, is being published Tuesday by Twelve in the wake of the unexpected passage of Brexit in Great Britain and the surprise election of Donald Trump in the United States. \n \n In a final chapter, Rice describes \"the rise of populism, nativism, and a tinge of isolationism\" around the world. \"It is no surprise that this earthquake is shaking young democracies like Poland,\" she wrote. \"But it is stunning that it has jolted the most mature of them.\" \n \n The 486-page book is at its core a push-back to the America First ideology advocated by candidate Trump, the sense that the United States should be less engaged in international affairs and less concerned about advocating human rights outside its borders. Rice argues that the United States is essential in protecting and expanding democracies, an approach that she says ultimately safeguards American interests. \n \n In an interview Saturday with USA TODAY's video newsmaker series, Rice was tempered in her comments about Trump \u2014 praising his national-security team as \"outstanding,\" saying Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was \"fantastic,\" and suggesting the president and his administration was successfully learning on the job. She declined to criticize the administration's proposal to cut the State Department budget by nearly 30% and to eliminate thousands of agency jobs. \n \n Consider Trump's praise of authoritarian strongmen abroad, among them Russian President Vladimir Putin, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and even North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. \"A pretty smart cookie,\" Trump said in an interview on CBS' Face the Nation last week. \n \n Does that send a dangerous message? \n \n \"The president's words matter,\" Rice said, though she distinguished between allies like el-Sisi \u2014 \"I have no problem with that\" \u2014 and adversaries like the erratic Kim. \n \n \"The president of the United States is the most important voice for our foreign policy. He's the most important voice for our values and for our interests, and the use of that voice is important, and I think we're starting to see recognition of that.\" \n \n While every new president faces a learning curve, she acknowledged that it may be particularly steep in this administration. \"President Trump has never been in government,\" she noted. \"As a matter of fact, a lot of the people around him have never been in government as well. Yes, I think that they are getting accustomed to what the presidency can do.\" \n \n Democracy: Stories from the Long Road to Freedom, by Condoleezza Rice (Photo: Twelve, publisher) \n \n Rice, now 62 and a professor at Stanford, was a National Security Council aide with a specialty in Russia for the elder President Bush. (She still occasionally watches Russian newscasts online.) During the younger President Bush's administration, she became the first woman to serve as White House national security adviser. She was secretary of State during George W. Bush's second term. \n \n During last year's presidential campaign, she called for Trump to withdraw as a candidate after the release of the Access Hollywood tape that included audio of him bragging about sexually assaulting women. \"Enough!\" she wrote on Facebook in October. \"Donald Trump should not be President.\" \n \n Five months later, in March, she sat down with Trump in the White House for what she calls \"a very good meeting.\" \n \n \"For me, he is the president of the United States,\" she said. \"He won it fair and square. We have an electoral process in our democracy and I completely respect that process and its outcome. I also respect the fact that he saw something and felt something in the population that a lot of people didn't see. And people took the democratic road to find a candidate who they thought would represent their interests and deal with their aspirations, deal with their fears, and so I respect that. \n \n \"He's the president, and I'll do what I can to help him.\" \n \n That is, to help him.

The French spend too much money and they spend too much in the wrong places. This will not work over time.\u201d \n \n The euro fell from six-month highs against the dollar on confirmation of Macron\u2019s widely expected victory by a margin of 66 percent to 34 percent. Investors took profit on a roughly 3 percent gain for the currency since he won the first round two on April 23. \n \n France\u2019s economic malaise, especially high unemployment, had undermined the popularity of outgoing Socialist President Francois Hollande to the point where he decided not even to run again as a candidate. \n \n \u201cThis year, I wanted Emmanuel Macron to be here with me so that a torch could be passed on,\u201d said Hollande, appearing with Macron at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris to commemorate Victory in Europe Day and the surrender of Nazi forces on May 8, 1945 at the end of World War Two. \n \n Elsewhere in Paris, more than 1,500 people, led by the powerful CGT labor federation, marched in protest against Macron\u2019s planned liberalization of labor laws. \n \n \u201cIf he continues with the idea of executive orders in July, that means he will sweep away consultation and dialogue, so there will be a problem one way or another. We shall see,\u201d Jean-Claude Mailly, secretary general of the hardline leftist Force Ouvriere union told France Info radio. \n \n PARLIAMENTARY MAJORITY \n \n On assuming office next Sunday as France\u2019s youngest leader since Napoleon, Macron faces the immediate challenge of securing a majority in the June parliamentary election to have a realistic chance of implementing his plans for lower state spending, higher investment and reform of the tax, labor and pension systems. \n \n With the two mainstream parties - the conservative Republicans and the left-wing Socialists - both failing to reach the presidential runoff vote, his chances of winning a majority that supports his election pledges will depend on him widening his centrist base. \n \n The Socialists are torn between the radical left of their defeated candidate Benoit Hamon and the more centrist, pro-business branch led by Manuel Valls, who was prime minister under Hollande. \n \n Outgoing French President Francois Hollande (R) and President-elect Emmanuel Macron attend a ceremony to mark the end of World War II at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, France, May 8, 2017. REUTERS/Benoit Tessier \n \n On Monday, key members of the centrist arm of The Republicans appeared ready to work with Macron despite the party hierarchy calling for unity to oppose the new president and calling those that were wavering \u201ctraitors\u201d. \n \n \u201cI can work in a government majority,\u201d said Bruno Le Maire, a senior Republicans official, who had been an aide of presidential candidate Francois Fillon, and is tipped by some to become the new foreign minister. \n \n \u201cThe situation is too serious for sectarianism and to be partisan,\u201d he said, later adding that Macron\u2019s victory was positive for France. \n \n However, a senior Republican, Christian Estrosi, who had backed Macron and been rumored to rally behind him, said on Monday he had turned down a ministerial post in order to focus on his home city of Nice. \n \n \u201cI will say things clearly: my only ambition is to serve my city and my region and not to enter the government,\u201d Estrosi later told reporters. \n \n Macron\u2019s party chief, Richard Ferrand, told a news conference his \u201cEn Marche!\u201d movement will now change its name to \u201cEn Marche la R\u00e9publique\u201d or \u201cRepublic on the Move\u201d, so as to structure itself more like a traditional party. \n \n He also said the names of Macron\u2019s 577 candidates in the legislative elections would be announced this Thursday. \n \n Macron stepped down from the chairmanship of the movement on Thursday and 68-year-old former Socialist government adviser Catherine Barbaroux was named as interim president. \n \n Slideshow (22 Images) \n \n Le Pen, 48, defiantly claimed the mantle of France\u2019s main opposition in calling on \u201call patriots\u201d to constitute a \u201cnew political force\u201d. \n \n Her tally was almost double the score that her father Jean-Marie, the last far-right candidate to make the presidential runoff, achieved in 2002, when he was trounced by the conservative Jacques Chirac. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption How did a 39-year-old with a new party who has never before been elected win the French presidency? \n \n Emmanuel Macron has triggered a political earthquake in French politics. \n \n A year ago, he was a member of the government of one of the most unpopular French presidents in history. \n \n Now, at 39, he has won France's presidential election, defeating first the mainstream centre left and centre right and now the far right as well. \n \n He got lucky \n \n No doubt about it, Mr Macron was carried to victory in part by the winds of fortune. \n \n A public scandal knocked out the initial frontrunner, centre-right candidate Fran\u00e7ois Fillon; and Socialist candidate Beno\u00eet Hamon, already on the left fringe of the party, suffered a very public drubbing as traditional voters looked elsewhere. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption A \"fake jobs\" scandal put paid to the hopes of the early election frontrunner, Fran\u00e7ois Fillon \n \n \"He was very lucky, because he was facing a situation that was completely unexpected,\" says Marc-Olivier Padis, of Paris-based think tank Terra Nova. \n \n He was canny \n \n Luck doesn't tell the whole story. \n \n Mr Macron could have gone for the Socialist ticket, but he realised after years in power and dismal public approval ratings the party's voice would always struggle to be heard. \n \n \"He was able to foresee there was an opportunity when nobody could,\" says Mr Padis. \n \n Instead, he looked at political movements that have sprung up elsewhere in Europe - Podemos in Spain, Italy's Five-Star Movement - and saw that there was no equivalent game-changing political force in France. \n \n In April 2016, he established his \"people-powered\" En Marche! (On the move) movement and four months later he stood down from President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande's government. \n \n He tried something new in France \n \n Having established En Marche, he took his cue from Barack Obama's grassroots 2008 US election campaign, says Paris-based freelance journalist Emily Schultheis. \n \n His first major undertaking was the Grande Marche (Big March), when he mobilised his growing ranks of energised but inexperienced En Marche activists. \n \n \"The campaign used algorithms from a political firm they worked with - who by the way had volunteered for the Obama campaign in 2008 - to identify districts and neighbourhoods that were most representative of France as a whole,\" Ms Schultheis says. \n \n \"They sent out people to knock on 300,000 doors.\" \n \n The volunteers didn't just hand out flyers - they carried out 25,000 in-depth interviews of about 15 minutes with voters across the country. That information was entered into a large database which helped inform campaign priorities and policies. \n \n \"It was a massive focus group for Macron in gauging the temperature of the country but also made sure that people had contact with his movement early on, making sure that volunteers knew how to go door to door. It was a training exercise that really laid the groundwork for what he did this year,\" Ms Schultheis explains. \n \n And he capitalised on it. \n \n He had a positive message \n \n Mr Macron's political persona appears beset with contradictions. \n \n The \"newcomer\" who was President Hollande's protege and then economy minister; the ex-investment banker running a grassroots movement; the centrist with a radical programme to slash the public sector. \n \n It was perfect ammunition for run-off rival Marine Le Pen, who said he was the candidate of the elite, not the novice he said he was. \n \n Image copyright Getty/AFP Image caption Protester versus pop music - observers said Le Pen rallies couldn't match the positivity on show at Macron gatherings \n \n But he dodged attempts to label him as another Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, creating a profile that resonated among people desperate for something new. \n \n \"There is a very prevalent pessimistic mood in France - in a way, too pessimistic - and he comes with a very optimistic, positive message,\" says Marc-Olivier Padis. \n \n \"He's young, full of energy, and he's not explaining what he'll do for France but how people will get opportunities. He's the only one to have this kind of message.\" \n \n He was up against Marine Le Pen \n \n Up against his more optimistic tone, Marine Le Pen's message came across as negative - anti-immigration, anti-EU, anti-system. \n \n Macron campaign rallies featured brightly lit arenas blaring with pop music, says Emily Schultheis, while Marine Le Pen's mass meetings involved protesters throwing bottles and flares, a heavy police presence, dark audience stands and an \"angrier\" undercurrent. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Emmanuel Macron's rallies came across as youthful and fresh, while his rival's message appeared more negative \n \n The big TV debate on 3 May was an angry affair, with a string of insults hurled by both sides. \n \n She was a \"grand priestess of fear\", a snake-oil merchant from the same extremist background as her father. He was a Socialist puppet, a dangerous tool of global finance who would do whatever Germany's Angela Merkel asked. \n \n But many were alarmed by the prospect of a potentially destabilising and divisive far-right presidency and saw him as the last obstacle in her way. \n \n Marine Le Pen may have run a highly effective campaign, but her poll ratings have been on the slide for months. She was ahead in the polls last year, nudging 30%, and yet in just two weeks she has been beaten twice by Emmanuel Macron. \n \n Insults that marked fierce debate \n \n The issues dividing Le Pen and Macron \n \n In depth: Meteoric rise of Emmanuel Macron \n \n In depth: Is Marine Le Pen far right? ||||| (CNN) By turning to Emmanuel Macron as its new president, France has elevated a charismatic new leader in the great political battle between globalism and nationalism that is underway in Western democracies. \n \n The 39-year-old's win over far-right candidate Marine Le Pen Sunday in the second round of the French election represents liberal internationalism's most significant response yet to the populist tsunami that yielded President Donald Trump and Brexit and ended a crop of establishment political careers. \n \n Macron, a proponent of globalization, centrist politics and the European Union, in effect erected a bastion against the unconventional and disruptive forces that have roiled developed world politics over the last year. \n \n \"This is our civilization that's at stake, our way of life,\" Macron said shortly after his victory, in which he took around 66% of the vote against Le Pen. \n \n But it would be premature to declare that the populist wave has reached a high-water mark, given the recent turbulence in international politics. And Macron, who ran as an outsider despite establishment credentials, does bear some resemblance -- in his light political resume if nothing else -- to the neophyte leaders who have come from nowhere to shake up politics. \n \n The French campaign trod what has become familiar ground in big Western elections over the last year. It saw the older, establishment politicians crushed as they failed to identify and adapt to waves of change. None of the traditional parties reached the run-off as voters in France, like elsewhere, soured on the same old choices. \n \n As with the Brexit referendum and the US election last year, the election was fought on the fault line between well-off, cosmopolitan, urban elites and insurgents who tapped the frustrations of rural, less-educated and poorer voters, ones who are fixated on immigration policies and feel disenfranchised in a global economy that has hemorrhaged blue collar jobs. \n \n A fresh-faced candidate wins \n \n But this time, the elite candidate -- albeit one whose youth and outlook suggested a break from older, more conventional political forces -- came out on top. In effect, Macron ran on insider ground while adopting the rhetoric and habits of an outsider. \n \n The graduate of exclusive French schools who become a banker and finance minister formed his own party \"En Marche\" to escape the taint of the political establishment. His youth was a break from the past in itself. He will be the youngest French president ever and the youngest French leader, period, since Napoleon. \n \n That sense of freshness could help break the somber mood that has settled over French politics for years -- though his inexperience will also test him. \n \n Such attributes allowed him to separate himself from old-school politics and the establishment \"swamp\" in a way that Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, with her decades at the center of Washington intrigue, failed to do last year. \n \n Macron's victory is likely to be studied by other centrist hopefuls in Europe and the United States as they struggle to combat the powerful economic message of candidates like Trump. \n \n JUST WATCHED What to know about Emmanuel Macron Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH What to know about Emmanuel Macron 01:32 \n \n He will have to tackle the question of how to reach out to those who have given up on politics as usual and who find the promises of Trump and candidates like him so attractive. \n \n In fact, Macron's enthusiastic support for the EU and globalization was an implicit rebuke to the instincts of Trump and those who successfully campaigned for Britain to leave the European Union. \n \n He portrayed himself as a reformer, but as a bulwark against the forces of disruption dedicated to tearing down institutions rather than repairing them. \n \n But he also took aim at the hidebound realities of French politics by warning of public spending cuts and more free market reforms designed to kick-start France's highly regulated economy. \n \n Macron's triumph will buck up establishment figures who have had little to cheer in recent months: He was endorsed by former President Barack Obama, who is seeing his own legacy dismantled by the populist Trump. Macron also carried the hopes of European elites like German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \n \n Trump, however, had seemed to hint earlier in the race that he preferred Le Pen. The US President has struck similar themes to Le Pen on Islamic terrorism and immigration. And following a terrorist attack in Paris last month, he tweeted: \"Will have a big effect on presidential election!\" \n \n Reinforcing the EU \n \n Despite the idiosyncrasies of the French race, many European analysts believe that Macron's win sent an unequivocal signal at an existential moment for EU unity. \n \n \"This is a victory of values, the values of the Enlightenment, the values of France, the values on which America was founded, the values from which the US and the UK have gone significantly astray,\" said Nicholas Dungan, an Atlantic Council senior fellow, who teaches at Sciences Po, a top international research university in France that counts Macron as among its most distinguished alumni. \n \n \"This is the end of know-nothing populism,\" he said. \n \n Macron's victory is already being seen as an invigorating boost for the European Union, which was knocked sideways by the British decision to exit and would have faced a meltdown had Le Pen, an avowed opponent of the European bloc, won. \n \n \"The French electorate clearly said after Brexit, against all the forecasts from the Dr. Dooms of this world, that they were against Frexit and against leaving the Eurozone,\" said Philippe Le Corre, a Brookings Institution visiting fellow, who is a former French Defense Ministry official. \n \n Just as Trump raged against Washington, Le Pen played into frustration with distant EU bureaucrats among blue collar voters, a tactic that proved potent for \"Leave\" campaigners in the British referendum. \n \n JUST WATCHED Macron addresses nation after election Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Macron addresses nation after election 02:05 \n \n But this time, the anti-establishment fury was not enough. \n \n In dramatic scenes Sunday, Macron, whose supporters often waved EU flags alongside those of the French tricolor, marched to his victory rally at the Louvre in Paris to the strains of Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\" \u2014 which serves as the European anthem. \n \n In many ways, the trauma of the UK's vote to leave Europe, which was warmly and repeatedly welcomed by Trump as a political achievement akin to his own shock election victory, appears to have concentrated the minds of French voters. \n \n \"The Brexit vote, you could even say, helped (Macron), because it helped France realize the importance of the European Union,\" said Dominic Thomas, head of the Department of French and Francophone Studies at UCLA, on CNN International. \n \n There are some reasons to think that the populist wave has broken. \n \n Le Pen's defeat follows a showing of far-right leader Geert Wilders in the Dutch election in March that fell short of expectations. In local council elections across the Channel last week, meanwhile, the UK Independence Party, which campaigned for Brexit, was all but wiped out. A surge by a right-wing populist party in Germany, the AfD, appears to have peaked ahead of Merkel's re-election bid in the fall. \n \n Yet it would be premature to dismiss populist, anti-establishment sentiments as a force in modern Western politics. For one thing, some establishment parties have adopted populist positions -- one reason why UKIP voters, for instance, are moving back towards the Conservative Party in Britain ahead of a general election in June. \n \n Le Pen splits France \n \n And after all, Le Pen managed to garner around 34% of the vote in the second round of an election which opened up deep splits in French society. \n \n Still, Macron's presidency may not count for much unless he is able to address the feelings of economic disenfranchisement and blight that have forced themselves to the fore in elections in the Western world over the last year. \n \n Macron signaled in his victory speech that he understood the stakes, asking his supporters not to boo Le Pen or her partisans. \n \n \"They expressed today anger, dismay and sometimes strong beliefs. I respect them but I will do everything over the next five years to make sure there is no reason at all to vote for extremes,\" Macron said. \n \n The new French President will also have to consider how to frame his relations with the United States and Trump, whom he will now encounter at the G7 and NATO summits in Europe this month. \n \n Populist influences in the White House, including political guru Steve Bannon, have been openly critical of the European Union. \n \n But Trump played it straight down the line on Sunday, writing on Twitter: \"Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next President of France. I look very much forward to working with him!\" \n \n Macron, for all his philosophical, generational and temperamental differences with Trump, is likely to move carefully, stressing areas of agreement with the administration -- on fighting terrorism for instance. \n \n But he is likely to be critical of Trump in places where the US and France differ, like climate change.",

But 34% was still a record for Le Pen's National Front, and analysts say it shows the pro-business, pro-EU Macron has a big struggle ahead to unite a divided nation\u2014as does the fact that in a race between two political outsiders, more than a third of voters either didn't show up or cast a blank ballot. A roundup of coverage: The BBC looks at five reasons for what it calls the \"political earthquake\" of Macron's victory. They include the scandal that knocked out the initial front-runner, and a strong grassroots operation inspired by Barack Obama's 2008 victory. The result may be a sign that the \"populist wave\" that led to the Brexit vote and the election of President Trump may be fading, the New York Times reports. \"I understand the divisions of our country that have led some to vote for extremists,\" Macron said after the vote. \"I understand the anger, the anxiety, the doubts that a great part among us have also expressed.\" Governing is going to be the hard part for Macron, who will have to deal with the country's established political parties while implementing his \"neither left nor right\" policies, EJ Dionne writes in a Washington Post op-ed. \"Macron is both a former investment banker and a moderate social democrat,\" he writes. \"Demonstrating how these two sides of him fit together will define the drama of his presidency.\" The Guardian predicts that there will be no honeymoon period for the 39-year-old president-elect and his \"En Marche\" movement. As well as the sharp divide between left and right, he has to deal with problems including mass youth unemployment, rising inequality, and the threat of terrorism, which still has the country under a state of emergency. Condoleezza Rice tells USA Today that despite the defeat, Marine Le Pen and similar anti-free trade, anti-immigration populists are still having a worrying effect on politics. \"I really do believe that these populists are changing the character of the politics just by being there, so even mainstream candidates are having to respond to their agenda,\" she says. Vladimir Putin and President Trump were among the world leaders congratulating Macron on Sunday. \"I look very much forward to working with him!\" Trump tweeted. A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel described the win as a victory for a \"strong and united Europe,\" France24 reports. CNN notes that centrist candidates in Europe and elsewhere are now looking to Macron for an example of how to defeat candidates like Le Pen amid widespread voter dissatisfaction.

Demonstrators flocked... (Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. military will continue to permit transgender individuals to serve openly until Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has received President Donald Trump's \"direction\" to change the policy and figured out how to implement it, America's top military officer said Thursday. \n \n In a memo to all military service chiefs, commanders and enlisted military leaders, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said \"there will be no modifications\" to current policy for now, amid questions about Trump's announcement on Twitter that the U.S. government will not \"accept or allow\" transgender people to serve in any capacity in the military. \n \n \"I know there are questions about yesterday's announcement,\" Dunford began, adding that nothing would change until the president's direction has been received by Mattis and Mattis has issued \"implementation guidance.\" \n \n \"In the meantime, we will continue to treat all of our personnel with respect,\" Dunford wrote. \"As importantly, given the current fight and the challenges we face, we will all remain focused on accomplishing our assigned missions.\" \n \n The Dunford statement suggests that Mattis was given no presidential direction on changing the transgender policy. Mattis has been on vacation this week and has been publicly silent amid questions about Trump's announced ban. His spokesmen declined to comment Thursday. On Wednesday they said the Pentagon would work with the White House and provide revised guidance to the military \"in the near future.\" \n \n Dunford himself was not aware that Trump was going to announce the ban, a U.S. official said. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter and so spoke on condition of anonymity. \n \n Trump's announcement caught the Pentagon flat-footed and unable to explain what it called Trump's \"guidance.\" \n \n \"Please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military,\" the commander in chief tweeted. \n \n Trump wrote that he had consulted with \"my generals and military experts,\" but he did not mention Mattis, the retired Marine general who recently told the service chiefs to spend another six months weighing the costs and benefits of allowing transgender individuals to enlist. At the time, Mattis said this \"does not presuppose the outcome of the review,\" but Trump's tweets appeared to have done just that. \n \n The Pentagon has not released data on the number of transgender people currently serving. A Rand Corp. study has estimated the number at between 1,320 and 6,630 out of 1.3 million active-duty troops. \n \n Criticism for Trump's action was immediate and strong from both political parties. \n \n John McCain, the Arizona Republican and Vietnam War hero, said Trump was simply wrong. \n \n \"Any American who meets current medical and readiness standards should be allowed to continue serving,\" he said. \"There is no reason to force service members who are able to fight, train and deploy to leave the military -- regardless of their gender identity.\" \n \n Not everyone at the Capitol agreed. \n \n Rep. Duncan Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said: \"It's about time that a decision is made to restore the warrior culture and allow the U.S. military to get back to business.\" \n \n Transgender people already in uniform were concerned about what comes next. \n \n \"Everybody is hurt, everybody is scared,\" said Rudy Akbarian, 26, who is in the military but did not want to identify his branch. \n \n Trump's sudden declaration appears to halt a decades-long trend toward more inclusive policies on military service, including the repeal in 2010 of a ban on gays serving openly. President Bill Clinton in 1993 began the push to allow gays to serve. In December 2015, President Barack Obama's Pentagon chief, Ash Carter, announced that all military positions would be open to women. Liberalizing policy on transgender troops was the next step. \n \n Just last week, when asked about the transgender issue at a Senate hearing, Gen. Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, \"I am an advocate of every qualified person who can meet the physical standards to serve in our uniformed services to be able to do so.\" \n \n Transgender service members have been able to serve openly since 2016, when Carter ended the ban. Since Oct. 1, transgender troops could receive medical care and start changing their gender identifications in the Pentagon's personnel system. \n \n Carter also gave the services until July 1 to develop policies to allow people already identifying as transgender to join the military if they meet normal standards and have been stable in their identified genders for 18 months. \n \n On June 30, Mattis extended the July 1 deadline to next Jan. 1, saying the services should study the impact on the \"readiness and lethality of our forces.\" \n \n White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump had made \"a military decision.\" She said it was his judgment that allowing transgender service \"erodes military readiness and unit cohesion.\" \n \n Sanders said the \"president's national security team was part of this consultation\" and that Trump \"informed\" Mattis of his decision immediately after he made it on Tuesday. ||||| CLOSE President Donald Trump said he will reverse former President Obama's policy that allowed transgender troops to serve openly in the military. USA TODAY \n \n Protesters gather in front of the White House on July 26, 2017, in Washington, D.C.

(Photo: Paul J. Richards, AFP/Getty Images) \n \n WASHINGTON \u2013 Military leaders sought to reassure transgender troops Thursday that their jobs and health care are safe \u2013 at least for now \u2013 after President Trump's tweets a day earlier that implied an immediate end to both. \n \n The Navy offered the most specific guidance, saying no transgender sailors will be discharged and the service will continue to provide health care for them, according to an email obtained by USA TODAY. \n \n Meanwhile, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Marine Gen. Joe Dunford, told all the service chiefs in a memo that there will be no changes in transgender policy until Defense Secretary Jim Mattis receives specific direction from the White House. \n \n Yet administration officials said that guidance may be weeks or even months away. \n \n White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said there was no timetable to implement Trump's tweets on Wednesday morning that declared transgender troops would not be welcome to serve in any capacity, and that the military would not pay for their medical treatment. \n \n Military leaders acknowledged the tumult created by those tweets, and that they were blindsided by the announcement. \n \n The Navy's guidance, which came in an email from Vice Adm. Robert Burke, also acknowledges that Trump's announcement is \"causing concern for some of our sailors and that they likely have questions.\" \n \n What's more, Burke indicates that Trump's tweets caught military brass unawares. \n \n Burke notes that the office of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is \"working to quickly discern the President's intent.\" Mattis was on vacation when Trump made his announcement. \n \n The Defense Secretary, and by extension, the Navy \"will not take any personnel actions or change any policy until further guidance from the President is received,\" Burke wrote, adding that transgender sailors receiving medical care will continue \"to receive all necessary medical care\" and none would be discharged. \n \n He concluded by saying, \"treating service members with dignity and respect is something we expect from our Sailors at all times.\" \n \n Related: \n \n Trump's decision to ban transgender troops in three tweets left the White House and Pentagon scrambling to determine how to proceed in the immediate aftermath Wednesday. One day later, there has been no formal policy guidance issued from the White House about reversing the policy that started last year under the Obama administration to allow transgender troops to serve openly. \n \n In July 2016, then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter outlined a plan to allow transgender troops to receive treatment that ranges from counseling to hormone treatment to gender reassignment surgery. Before that, those service members could have been discharged for medical reasons. There may be as many as 6,600 transgender troops on the military's active duty force of 1.3 million, according to a RAND Corp. report. \n \n As civil liberties and LGBTQ groups continue to denounce Trump's decision, the White House has been unable to answer questions about whether transgender service members would be dismissed from the military \u2013 even if they are currently deployed to conflict zones such as Afghanistan. \n \n CLOSE Here is a guide to understanding LGBT terms. Sara Snyder, USA TODAY \n \n Explaining his rationale on Wednesday, Trump said the U.S. military \"must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\" \n \n Yet any saving Trump hoped to achieve by denying transgender troops medical care will be overshadowed by the cost of replacing them. \n \n The RAND Corp., a non-partisan think tank commissioned by the Pentagon to study the issue, found that only a few hundred of the estimated 6,600 transgender troops would seek medical treatment in any year. RAND found those costs would total no more than $8 million per year. \n \n Replacing them transgender troops would likely be far more costly. The Army, for example, is spending $300 million this year on bonuses and ads to recruit 6,000 soldiers. That does not include the money needed to train, equip and pay them. \n \n Though Trump's tweets said he made the decision after consulting \"with my generals and military experts,\" it remains unclear who took part in those discussions. \n \n Navy Capt.

The perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces. \n \n WHAT MAKES MEN LOOK SMART? Faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are rather prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. \n \n By contrast, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin. \n \n 'The ability to accurately assess the intelligence of other persons finds its place in everyday social interaction and should have important evolutionary consequences,' the team wrote in the journal PLoS One. \n \n The team used static facial photographs of 40 men and 40 women to test the relationship between measured IQ, perceived intelligence, and facial shape. \n \n \n \n Both men and women were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men by viewing facial photographs, they discovered. \n \n \n \n 'These results suggest that a perceiver can accurately gauge the real intelligence of men, but not women, by viewing their faces in photographs; however, this estimation is possibly not based on facial shape,' they claim. \n \n 'Our study revealed no relation between intelligence and either attractiveness or face shape. \n \n People can accurately judge intelligence by looking at faces of men, but not women.' \n \n Researchers found the same effect was not present when they used female faces \n \n They say this could be due to the fact attractiveness clouds the judgement. \n \n \n \n 'Another option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness,' they add. \n \n 'The strong halo effect of attractiveness may thus prevent an accurate assessment of the intelligence of women.' \n \n \n \n The study, in the journal PLoS One, reports people tend to associate certain facial traits with high intelligence. \n \n \n \n The researchers report these notions 'represent nothing but a cultural stereotype,' but some still-unidentified visual cues apparently point them in the right direction. \n \n 'Faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are rather prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. \n \n \n \n 'By contrast, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin. \n \n \n \n 'By contrast, we found no correlation between morphological traits and real intelligence measured with IQ test, either in men or women. \n \n \n \n Specifically, they write, 'two factors of general intelligence were significantly associated with perceived intelligence from men\u2019s faces: fluid intelligence and figural intelligence. \n \n ' Fluid intelligence is the capacity to logically solve problems independent of acquired knowledge. \n \n Figurative intelligence describes the ability to handle objects such as images, patterns and shapes.\u201d ||||| People can predict the IQ of men \u2014 but not women \u2014 by looking at their face, study finds \n \n New research published in PLoS One has found that a man\u2019s facial characteristics contain some clues about his intelligence. Surprisingly, the same can\u2019t be said for women\u2019s facial traits. And the particular male facial characteristics linked with intelligence are a mystery. \n \n \u201cOur raters were able to estimate intelligence with an accuracy higher than chance from static facial photographs of men but not from photos of women. At the same time, we found no differences in the abilities of men and women to assess intelligence from static facial photos: the ratings of both sexes were highly correlated,\u201d Karel Kleisner of Charles University in Prague and her colleagues wrote in their study. \n \n For their study, the researchers recruited 80 students, who completed an IQ test and had their face photographed with a neutral expression. Another 160 students rated the 80 photographs in random order for either perceived intelligence or attractiveness. \n \n The researchers found that people who were perceived as more attractive also tended to be perceived as more intelligent by both male and female participants. This link between perceived attractiveness and perceived intelligence was stronger for women\u2019s faces than men\u2019s faces. \n \n The researchers also found that the participants rated men with a high IQ as more intelligent based solely on their facial photograph. For women, however, the researchers found no statistically significant link between perceived intelligence and their actual IQ. \n \n Naturally, the findings raised the question of why people could predict men\u2019s intelligence based on their face, but not predict women\u2019s intelligence based on their face. The researchers proposed a number of explanations to be tested by future research. \n \n \u201cOne possible explanation is that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men\u2019s faces, e.g. due to some genetic and developmental association to sex steroid hormonal agents during puberty,\u201d Kleisner and her colleagues wrote. \n \n \u201cAnother option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness. The strong halo effect of attractiveness may thus prevent an accurate assessment of the intelligence of women,\u201d the researchers added. \n \n By examining the geometric features of the faces, the researchers were able to determine there was a link between certain facial characteristics and perceived intelligence for both men and women. \n \n \u201cOur data suggest that a clear mental image how a smart face should look does exist for both men and women within the community of human raters,\u201d the researchers explained. \u201cIn both sexes, a narrower face with a thinner chin and a larger prolonged nose characterizes the predicted stereotype of high-intelligence, while a rather oval and broader face with a massive chin and a smallish nose characterizes the prediction of low-intelligence.\u201d \n \n But these facial characteristics were only associated with perceived intelligence. The researchers found no link between these facial traits and actual IQ scores. \n \n \u201cThis means that our raters accurately assessed intelligence from faces of men based on visual cues that simply are not explicable from shape variability in men\u2019s faces,\u201d the researchers wrote. \n \n But the correlation between these geometric traits and perceived attractiveness suggests there is an intelligence stereotype. \n \n \u201cThese faces of supposed high and low intelligence probably represent nothing more than a cultural stereotype because these morphological traits do not correlate with the real intelligence of the subjects,\u201d the researchers said. ||||| Abstract Background The ability to accurately assess the intelligence of other persons finds its place in everyday social interaction and should have important evolutionary consequences. Methodology/Principal Findings We used static facial photographs of 40 men and 40 women to test the relationship between measured IQ, perceived intelligence, and facial shape. Both men and women were able to accurately evaluate the intelligence of men by viewing facial photographs. In addition to general intelligence, figural and fluid intelligence showed a significant relationship with perceived intelligence, but again, only in men. No relationship between perceived intelligence and IQ was found for women. We used geometric morphometrics to determine which facial traits are associated with the perception of intelligence, as well as with intelligence as measured by IQ testing. Faces that are perceived as highly intelligent are rather prolonged with a broader distance between the eyes, a larger nose, a slight upturn to the corners of the mouth, and a sharper, pointing, less rounded chin. By contrast, the perception of lower intelligence is associated with broader, more rounded faces with eyes closer to each other, a shorter nose, declining corners of the mouth, and a rounded and massive chin. By contrast, we found no correlation between morphological traits and real intelligence measured with IQ test, either in men or women. Conclusions These results suggest that a perceiver can accurately gauge the real intelligence of men, but not women, by viewing their faces in photographs; however, this estimation is possibly not based on facial shape. Our study revealed no relation between intelligence and either attractiveness or face shape. \n \n Citation: Kleisner K, Chv\u00e1talov\u00e1 V, Flegr J (2014) Perceived Intelligence Is Associated with Measured Intelligence in Men but Not Women.

Though numerous and varied mammalian species exhibit well developed facial structures, the communicative and expressive roles of the face reach a unique level of ability in human beings [1]. It is well established in previous research that faces inform us about personality, sex, age, health, ethnicity, social rank, attractiveness and political affiliation, as well as, to some extent, the intelligence of the bearer [2]\u2013[9]. Some researchers have suggested that people tend to attribute higher intelligence to attractive persons [10], [11]. If women tend to prefer intelligent men because of their generally higher social status and these men in turn tend to prefer attractive women, the alleged covariance of attractiveness and intelligence should be of no surprise [12]. However, such findings are controversial and should be approached cautiously since Kanazawa's research methods and conclusions have attracted strong criticism [13]\u2013[15]. As with physical attractiveness, intelligence is suggested to indicate good genes [16], [17]. This notion is supported by the fact that during the fertile phase of their menstrual cycle, women display a higher preference for men who score highly in creative intelligence [18]. Intelligence is also correlated with humour, which is suggested to have evolved in sexual selection as an intelligence-indicator [19]. By modifying the good genes approach we find a bad genes hypothesis, which argues that even though unattractive faces signal poor genetic fitness, there is no difference in genetic fitness between faces of average and high attractiveness [20]. It has been also suggested that sexual selection has played a role in the evolution of particular facial features, which have evolved to signal high intelligence [10], [21]. Visual cues responsible for a higher attribution of intelligence may honestly reflect the real intelligence of a person and can therefore be used to indicate a preferential sexual or social partner. Past research shows that people are able to judge intelligence from the facial qualities of unknown persons, r = 0.28 [10]. Measured intelligence has been shown to correlate with perceived intelligence and other personality traits, whether self-reported (0.29) or rated either by intimate acquaintances (0.31) or strangers (0.38) [22]. In addition to visual cues, there is evidence of the accurate assessment of intelligence based on behavioural and acoustic cues [23]\u2013[26]. For example, measured intelligence significantly correlates with ratings by stranger in sound-film conditions (0.38) but not in silent-film conditions [22] and the correlation between measured intelligence and ratings of fluent speech is as high as r = 0.53 [23]. In general, inferences of intelligence taken from thin slices of behaviour have been shown to be highly accurate [27]. Gender influences the accuracy of intelligence assessment. Men were more accurately assessed for intelligence than women, while women were more accurate at assessing the intelligence of both men and women [26], [28]. Although a number of studies have examined the perception of intelligence from different visual cues, none of these studies describe the specific facial traits that play a role in intelligence assessment. The specific aim of the present study is to determine which facial shape cues are responsible for the attribution of intelligence, as well as those which correlate with actual intelligence. We also sought to identify which particular factors of general intelligence can accurately be assessed from facial photographs. Finally, using thin-plate spline extrapolation, we provide a statistically supported description of the intelligence-stereotype in order to depict the facial traits responsible for an attribution of intelligence. \n \n Methods The present study integrates data from two different studies in which two independent groups of students participated: the first group consisted of 80 biology students at the Faculty of Science who were tested for IQ and photographed; the second group involved 160 raters, students at the Faculty of Humanities who rated the photos of the biology students either for intelligence or for attractiveness (each student rated 80 randomized photos). Dataset is available at http://web.natur.cuni.cz/flegr/IQKleisne\u200bretal2013.xls Ethics statement The Institutional Review Board of Charles University, Faculty of Science approved this research. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants involved in our study. The data on measured intelligence, perceived intelligence and attractiveness were analyzed anonymously. IQ measurement To measure the intelligence of subjects, we used a Czech version of Intelligence Structure Test 2000 R [29], [30]. The test consists of a basic module, which is comprised of three verbal, three numerical, and three abstract figural reasoning tasks. The test also includes two memory tasks and a knowledge test. The knowledge test is focused on questions from geography/history, business, science, mathematics, arts, and daily life. As a whole, the test obtains a broad spectrum of results: the basic module measures verbal, numerical and figural IQ, as well as memory and reasoning; the knowledge test measures verbally, numerically and figurally coded knowledge; and both parts of the test measures fluid, crystallized, and general IQ. Fluid intelligence is the capacity to think logically and solve problems in novel situations, independent of acquired knowledge. This sort of reasoning does not reflect cultural differences but arises from biologically given cognitive abilities. Crystallized intelligence is the ability to use skills, knowledge, and experience. This sort of reasoning improves with age and reflects the lifetime achievement of an individual [31]. Verbal intelligence is the ability to use language to analyze and solve problems associated with language-based reasoning. Numerical intelligence is the ability to manipulate numerical symbols and to comprehend quantitative relationships. Figural intelligence is the ability to combine shapes and forms and to analyze spatial patterns. The university students involved in this study showed a broad range of distribution of IQ (see Fig. 1.)

Histogram showing the range of distribution of IQ among university students involved in the present study. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081237.g001 We administered the exam on computers to 10\u201312 individuals in the same room and at the same time (at 9:15 am). The total length of time was about 145 minutes, including a15 minute break between the basic module and the second module with the memory tasks and knowledge test. The photographs Facial photographs of 80 students (40 men: Mean\u00b1 SD = 21.8\u00b12.8, range: 19\u201334, and 40 women: Mean\u00b1 SD = 20.9\u00b11.6, range: 19\u201324) from the Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic, were used as stimuli. The subjects were seated in front of a white background and photographed with a digital camera, Canon 450D, using studio electronic flash and reflection screen. The subjects were instructed to adopt a neutral, non-smiling expression and avoid facial cosmetics, jewellery, and other decorations. The photos were cropped to place the eyes horizontally at the same height and leave a standard length of neck visible. Rating the photographs One hundred sixty raters (75 men and 85 women) took part in judging the photographs; they had no connection either to the Faculty of Science or the rated subjects and were aged 26.7 years on average (women: Mean\u00b1 SD = 26.7\u00b17.7, range: 15\u201358; men: Mean\u00b1 SD = 26.7\u00b17.5, range: 16\u201355). Of these, 43 women (Mean\u00b1 SD = 27.1\u00b18.8, range: 15\u201358) and 42 men (Mean\u00b1 SD = 28.5\u00b18.2, range: 20\u201355) judged the subjects for intelligence. Another 42 women (Mean\u00b1 SD = 26.2\u00b16.4, range: 21\u201351) and 33 men (Mean\u00b1 SD = 24.5\u00b15.7, range: 16\u201338) judged the photos for attractiveness. Every person rated the whole set of 80 photos, either for perceived intelligence or attractiveness, using a seven-point scale wherein 1 stands for the highest ranking (for intelligence or attractiveness) and 7 the lowest (intelligence or attractiveness). The presentation and judgment of all photographs were performed using the software ImageRater 1.1. The raters were individually invited to judge the photographs. Each rater saw the photographs on a computer screen and indicated their valuation by mouse clicks on a discrete seven-point scale. No time limit was imposed. The order of the photographs was randomized for each rater. In the situation where a rater knew or was acquainted with a person pictured, she/he was instructed not to rate that picture. To eliminate the influence of individual differences between raters, the ratings of all photographs evaluated by each rater were converted to z-scores and the perceived intelligence/attractiveness of each photographed subject was calculated as its average z-score. The z-scores of perceived intelligence and attractiveness ratings were normally distributed. Statistics The relationship between measured IQ and perceived intelligence was tested by linear regression models using a mean z-score of perceived intelligence as the dependent variable and IQ values as the independent variable. The age of photographed individuals and raters was added as a covariate. We measured a Pearson correlation between perceived intelligence and perceived attractiveness to estimate the intensity of the halo effect in our population. Perceived attractiveness was added to the model as a covariate, because perceived intelligence strongly correlates with attractiveness. Each of the intelligence components was tested separately for men and women. Both quadratic and linear models were fitted, their statistical plausibility evaluated by F-test and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The effect size of an explanatory variable was expressed by partial \u03b72. Because the averaging of individual ratings can inflate the effect size of correlations [32], we have also calculated partial Pearson correlation between IQ and perceived intelligence for each rater with perceived attractiveness as a covariate and calculated average partial Pearson correlation for all raters. Significance level was estimated by permutation test with 10,000 randomizations. For each randomization, the order of values, represented by raters' assessment of perceived intelligence for 40 photos, was randomly changed. The partial Pearson correlation coefficient between permuted judgments of each rater and IQ values of photos was then computed and these correlation coefficients were averaged for all raters. A comparison of average correlation coefficient computed with original data with average coefficients computed from randomized sets of data (namely the fraction of higher or equal coefficients computed from randomized data sets) provided the statistical significance of the permutation test. For statistical analyses we used PASW/SPSS 18 and R statistical software version 2.13.2. For the permutation test we used Matlab v. 7.10.0.499. Geometric morphometrics Photographs of 40 men and 40 women were analyzed by geometric morphometric methods (GMM) in order to detect the facial features that are associated with either or both the perception of intelligence and intelligence measured with the Intelligence Structure Test in both men and women. The 72 landmarks (including 36 semilandmarks) were digitized by tpsDig2 software, ver. 2.14 [33]. Landmarks are represented as points that are anatomically (or at least geometrically) homologous in different individuals, while semilandmarks serve to denote curves and outlines. The definitions of landmark and semilandmark locations on human faces were derived from previous work [34]\u2013[37]. Semilandmarks were slid by tpsRelw (ver. 1.49) software. All configurations of landmarks and semilandmarks were superimposed by generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA), implemented in tpsRelw, ver. 1.46 [33]. This procedure standardized the size of the objects and optimized their rotation and translation so that the distances between corresponding landmarks were minimized. To observe the variation among the landmark data configurations of all specimens, the principal component analysis (PCA) \u2013 i.e., the relative warp analysis for parameter \u03b1 = 0 \u2013 was carried out in tpsRelw, ver. 1.46. [33]. To observe the shape variation associated with perceived intelligence/IQ, we regressed GPA shape coordinates onto scores of intelligence rating/IQ by using a multivariate regression in which the dependent variable was the shape coordinates and the independent variable was perceived intelligence ratings or IQ scores; this was conducted in tpsRegr, ver. 1.36 [38]. Shape regressions were displayed by thin-plate splines as a deformation from the overall mean configuration (the consensus) of landmarks. The composite images were constructed by tpsSuper 1.14 [39] using the original photographs of men and women that were unwarped to fixed configuration represented by the estimates of shape regressions. \n \n Discussion Our raters were able to estimate intelligence with an accuracy higher then chance from static facial photographs of men but not from photos of women. At the same time, we found no differences in the abilities of men and women to assess intelligence from static facial photos: the ratings of both sexes were highly correlated, r = 0.88. Perceived intelligence positively correlated with attractiveness in both men and women. Even though this contrasts some previous findings [10], [11], [40], [41], we did not observe any significant correlation between measured IQ and attractiveness. However, it should be noted that evidence for a relationship between actual intelligence and physical attractiveness in adults seems rather weak. Zebrowitz et al [10] did not find any significant correlation between perceived intelligence and attractiveness in individuals older than 18 years, i.e. middle adulthood (30 to 40) and later adulthood (52 to 60); however Zebrowitz et al did not examine individuals of a similar age bracket to our study (21.4 years in average). The existence of a correlation between attractiveness and intelligence in the age cohort from 19 to 29 years would appear questionable at the very least. Moreover, meta-analytic study has shown that physical attractiveness is not correlated to actual intellectual competence in adults, but is modestly correlated in children [15]. Similarly, other studies have reported close to zero correlation between attractiveness and actual intelligence in adults [40], [41]. We also showed that IQ has no statistically significant association in facial morphology in both men and women (at least as it was delimited by the landmark configuration used within this study). This means that our raters accurately assessed intelligence from faces of men based on visual cues that simply are not explicable from shape variability in men's faces. It is important to recall that our subjects were prompted to assume a neutral expression while their photo was taken and only photos of subjects with a neutral expression were included in the study. We can speculate about attributions of intelligence based on particular configurations of eyes or gaze, colour of eyes, hair and skin, or skin texture. These hypotheses should be tested in future studies. Intelligence stereotype Though we were not able to objectively detect an association between IQ and facial morphology, we can provide a statistically supported description of the stereotype of an intelligent-looking face. Our data suggest that a clear mental image how a smart face should look does exist for both men and women within the community of human raters. The intelligence-stereotype shows the same transformations in facial shape space for both men and women. In both sexes, a narrower face with a thinner chin and a larger prolonged nose characterizes the predicted stereotype of high-intelligence, while a rather oval and broader face with a massive chin and a smallish nose characterizes the prediction of low-intelligence (see Figs. 2 and 3). There also seems to be a correlation between semblances of emotions of joy or anger in perceptions of high or low intelligence in faces, respectively. The \u2018high intelligence\u2019 faces appear to be smiling more than the \u2018low intelligence\u2019 faces. A similar pattern was described for the perception of trustworthiness [37]. Perceived intelligence correlates with perceived trustworthiness and happiness. Conversely, low-intelligence faces are perceived as untrustworthy and considered angrier [42]. Moreover, perceived intelligence was also shown to be positively associated with perceived friendliness and sense of humour in both male and female faces but negatively related with perceived dominance in faces of women [43]. The face shape associated with a higher perception of intelligence also shows the characteristics of higher perception of attractiveness, while the face shape associated with a lower perception of intelligence shows traits of higher perceived dominance. The positive correlation with attractiveness and trustworthiness and negative correlation with dominance may explain the attribution of higher intelligence to longer, narrower faces. Correlation between IQ and perceived intelligence Two factors of general intelligence were significantly associated with perceived intelligence from men's faces: fluid intelligence and figural intelligence. Fluid intelligence is the capacity to logically solve problems independent of acquired knowledge [31]. It depends on a subject's genetic qualities and, largely, cannot be influenced by continuous exercise or life experience. Figural intelligence describes the ability to handle objects such as images, patterns, and shapes. One cannot explicitly say that figural intelligence is independent of experience acquired during life, though the nature of this ability would also be affected by heritable genetic cues (as well as nurturing or other environmental effects). By contrast, verbal and crystallized intelligence largely depend on the social environment. The quadratic shape of the negative relationship between perceived intelligence and IQ points at the constraints that limit the preference of men with a very high IQ. Men with an IQ higher than 140 are perceived as relatively less intelligent (see Fig. 4.), which can reflect an adaptation to an upper intelligence limit as men with an extremely high IQ could find such practical tasks, such as the care and protection of women and offspring, less rewarding. Though intelligence does not positively correlate with mental disorders or anomalies, there are some indications that extremely high intelligence combined with other factors such as creativity might carry a potential risk for various mental disorders [44]\u2013[46]. In a future survey, it would be interesting to search for correlations between perceived intelligence and deviations from facial symmetry. PPT PowerPoint slide \n \n PowerPoint slide PNG larger image ( ) \n \n larger image ( ) TIFF original image ( ) Download: Figure 4. Graph demonstrating linear positive and quadratic negative relationship between IQ and perceived intelligence in men (a) and women (b). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0081237.g004 If intelligence is judged with an accuracy higher than chance, and if intelligence is suggested to be at least partly heritable, we can then expect that intelligence could be an indicator of underlying genetic fitness with interesting consequences for human evolution [16], [17], [47], [48]. Our results necessarily imply the following question: Why does perceived intelligence reflect measured intelligence in men but not women. If facial indicators of intelligence are heritable, and if particular genes are not located on the Y sex chromosome, then both sons and daughters of an intelligent-looking father will obtain the alleles for an intelligent-looking face. One possible explanation is that cues of higher intelligence are sexually dimorphic and are thus apparent only in men's faces, e.g. due to some genetic and developmental association to sex steroid hormonal agents during puberty [49]\u2013[51]. If this is true, then the attribution of intelligence in infant faces should not differ between male and female children. When estimating the intelligence of women's faces, observers mechanically use criteria that \u201cwork\u201d in men's faces, i.e. the criteria that objectively reflect intelligence in men. Another option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness. The strong halo effect of attractiveness may thus prevent an accurate assessment of the intelligence of women. This seems to be supported by a significantly higher correlation of perceived intelligence with attractiveness in women's faces (r = 0.901) in comparison to that in men's faces (r = 0.502). The third possible explanation is that facial indicators of intelligence are signals rather than cues and that the honest signalling of intelligence is adaptive for men but not for women. It can be speculated, for example, that because of their mixed mating strategy, women prefer dominant men as extra-pair sexual partners while at the same time they seek men who are more willing to invest in their offspring as long-term or social partners [52]. It is known that while in the fertile phase of cycle and probably in search of good genes, women prefer creative intelligence to wealth especially in short-term mating [18]. On the other hand, a woman seeking a long term relationship could prefer a less intelligent but honest man, who compensates by long term provisioning, protection and a greater investment in childrearing. At the same time, the prevalence of the mixed mating strategy would influence so as to lead to frequency-dependent selection, and result in the stable coexistence of highly and lowly intelligent men within a population. To test this hypothesis, it will be necessary to search for correlations between women's preferences during their menstrual cycle and the IQ of their preferred partners. To conclude, humans were able to estimate actual intelligence from facial photographs of men but not women. The attractiveness ratings were not statistically related to measured intelligence in both men and women. No difference between men and women existed in the raters' ability to assess intelligence, and no specific traits that correlated with real intelligence were detected with standard geometric morphometric methods. Men and women with specific facial traits were perceived as highly intelligent. However, these faces of supposed high and low intelligence probably represent nothing more than a cultural stereotype because these morphological traits do not correlate with the real intelligence of the subjects. \n \n Acknowledgments We are grateful to all the students of Charles University in Prague who participated in the research.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's easier to guess men's intelligence than women's just by looking at their faces\u2014maybe because we're so distracted by female beauty, according to a new study. Czech researchers gave IQ tests to 80 male and female students, took photos of them, and asked 160 students to rate them in order of attractiveness and perceived intelligence, PsyPost reports. Generally, students deemed more attractive were also deemed smarter, especially among the women. Little surprise there, but somehow the 160 students were more able to spot men's actual IQ. Why is that? Maybe signs of higher intelligence are only visible in men's faces \"due to some genetic and developmental association,\" the researchers write. \"Another option is that women are pervasively judged according to their attractiveness,\" which prevents \"an accurate assessment of their intelligence.\" What's more, our ability to quickly identify a person's IQ may have \"evolutionary\" consequences, the researchers say, the Daily Mail reports.

    "document": "The Navy Gets Its First Female SEAL Candidate \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption MC1 Michael Russell/U.S. Navy MC1 Michael Russell/U.S. Navy \n \n The Navy says it has its first female candidates for two elite special operations jobs previously closed to women \u2014 including a prospective SEAL. \n \n One woman is in the pipeline to be a SEAL officer, and another is on the path to becoming a special warfare combatant crewman. The news was first reported by Military.com, an independent website. The Navy declined to identify the candidates, citing security considerations. \n \n The announcement comes more than 18 months after the Pentagon declared that women can now serve in front-line combat positions. \n \n \"They are the first candidates that have made it this far in the process,\" Lt. Cmdr. Mark Walton, spokesman for the Naval Special Warfare Command, told the Two-Way. \n \n Whoever these unnamed trailblazers are, the path ahead for them won't be easy. To become a SEAL or SWCC, they'll need to make it through Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL training, or BUD/S, which is designed to be extremely physically and mentally demanding. \n \n Few candidates who undertake the training emerge as SEALs or special boat operators. The enlisted SEAL attrition rate is 73 to 75 percent, according to the Navy, while the SWCC attrition rate is 63 percent. \n \n The SEAL officer program has a higher rate of success: 65 percent of candidates make it through. The officer program isn't easier, though \u2014 the Navy attributes the differing success rates to a larger number of candidates in the enlisted program. \n \n Female candidates for these jobs will have to complete the same training that men do, without any allowances for differing average physical capabilities. \n \n What makes the training so difficult? \n \n \"It's different for everyone,\" Walton said. \"It could be the physical stuff, it could be mental, it could be medical. There could be a lot of different reasons.\" \n \n While the two candidates are now closer to these elite Navy positions than a woman has ever been, it may be a while before one of them finally gets the job. \n \n \"It would be premature to speculate as to when we will see the first woman SEAL or SWCC graduate,\" Walton told NPR. \"It may take months and potentially years.\" \n \n Female candidates aren't the only change to come to the Navy's elite operations. Walton confirmed that SWCC now includes one transgender person. \n \n And if the two women in the Navy's special operations pipeline are successful, we may not get much detail. \n \n \"If you announce who they are, that removes the point of them becoming a special operator,\" said Walton. \"I guess we'll see what we do ... when we get there.\" ||||| More than a year after a mandate for the Pentagon opened previously closed ground combat and special operations jobs to women, officials say the Navy has its first female candidates for its most elite special warfare roles. \n \n Two women were in boot camp as candidates for the Navy's all-enlisted Special Warfare Combatant-Craft Crewman program, Naval Special Warfare Center Deputy Commander Capt. Christian Dunbar told members of the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Service in June. \n \n Another woman, who sources say is a junior in an ROTC program at an unnamed college, has applied for a spot in the SEAL officer selection process for fiscal 2018, which begins Oct. 1, and is set to complete an early step in the pipeline, special operations assessment and selection, later this summer, he said. \n \n \"That's a three-week block of instruction,\" Dunbar said. \"Then the [prospective SEAL officer] will compete like everyone else, 160 [applicants] for only 100 spots.\" \n \n Related content: \n \n A spokesman for Naval Special Warfare Command, Capt. Jason Salata, confirmed to Military.com this week that a single female enlisted candidate remained in the training pipeline for Special Warfare Combatant Crewman, or SWCC. The accession pipeline for the job, he added, included several screening evaluations and then recruit training at the Navy's Great Lakes, Illinois boot camp before Basic Underwater Demolition School training. \n \n Salata also confirmed that a female midshipman is set to train with other future Naval officers in the SEAL Officer Assessment and Selection, or SOAS, course this summer. \n \n \"[SOAS] is part of the accession pipeline to become a SEAL and the performance of attendees this summer will be a factor for evaluation at the September SEAL Officer Selection Panel,\" he said. \n \n Because of operational security concerns, Salata said the Navy would not identify the candidates or provide updates on their progress in the selection pipeline. In special operations, where troops often guard their identities closely to keep a low profile on missions, public attention in the training pipeline could affect a candidate's career. \n \n It's possible, however, that the first female member of these elite communities will come not from the outside, but from within. In October, a SWCC petty officer notified their chain-of-command that they identified as being transgender, Salata confirmed to Military.com. \n \n According to Navy policy guidance released last fall, a sailor must receive a doctor's diagnosis of medical necessity and command approval to begin the gender transition process, which can take a variety of different forms, from counseling and hormone therapy to surgery. Sailors must also prove they can pass the physical standards and requirements of the gender to which they are transitioning. \n \n These first female candidates represent a major milestone for the Navy, which has previously allowed women into every career field except the SEALs and SWCC community. A successful candidate would also break ground for military special operations. \n \n Army officials said in January that a woman had graduated Ranger school and was on her way to joining the elite 75th Ranger Regiment, but no female soldier has made it through the selection process to any other Army special operations element. The Air Force and Marine Corps have also seen multiple female candidates for special operations, but have yet to announce a successful accession. \n \n The two women now preparing to enter the Navy's special operations training pipeline will have to overcome some of the most daunting attrition rates in any military training process \n \n Dunbar said the SEALs, which graduate six Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL classes per year, have an average attrition rate of 73 to 75 percent, while the special boat operator community has an average attrition rate of 63 percent. The attrition rate for SEAL officers is significantly lower, though; according to the Navy's 2015 implementation plan for women in special warfare, up to 65 percent of SEAL officer candidates successfully enter the community. \n \n But by the time they make it to that final phase of training, candidates have already been weeded down ruthlessly. Navy officials assess prospective special warfare operators and special boat operators, ranking them by their scores on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, or ASVAB, physical readiness test, special operations resiliency test, and a mental toughness exam. The highest-ranking candidates are then assessed into training, based on how many spots the Navy has available at that point. \n \n \"We assess right now that, with the small cohorts of females, we don't really know what's going to happen as far as expected attrition,\" Dunbar, the Naval Special Warfare Center deputy commander, told DACOWITS in June. \n \n Dunbar did say, however, that Naval Special Warfare Command was considered fully ready for its first female SEALs and SWCC operators, whenever they ultimately arrived. A cadre of female staff members was in place in the training pipeline, and the command regularly held all-hands calls to discuss inclusivity and integration. \n \n \"All the barriers have been removed,\" he said. \"Our planning has been completed and is on track.\" \n \n Salata said the Navy had also completed a thorough review of its curriculum and policies and had evaluated facilities and support capabilities to determine any changes that might need to be made to accommodate women. As a result, he said, minor changes were made to lodging facilities and approved uniform items. \n \n Nonetheless, Salata said, \"It would be premature to speculate as to when we will see the first woman SEAL or SWCC graduate. Managing expectations is an important part of the deliberate assessment and selection process; it may take months and potentially years.\" \n \n Editor's note: This story has been updated in the third paragraph to correct the school the SEAL officer candidate attends.

    "document": "LAPORTE, Ind. (WOOD) \u2014 A man convicted of four 1993 murders who escaped Sunday from a state prison outside of Ionia was captured in Indiana Monday evening. \n \n Michael David Elliot, 40, was arrested in Kankakee Township in rural LaPorte County, Ind., and allegedly stole a total of four vehicles in his 24-hour run from the law. He was arraigned Tuesday in Indiana on auto theft charges. \n \n The sheriff\u2019s department had been looking for a black 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was stolen from the area of Boyd Avenue and E. Lincolnway in LaPorte, authorities said. Deputy Jeffrey Wright said the vehicle\u2019s engine was on so it would warm up when it was taken. The sheriff\u2019s department was alerted to the theft at 6:16 p.m. ET, according to a Monday night news release. \n \n Within minutes of learning of the theft, Deputy Slawek Czupryna spotted the stolen vehicle headed south on Boyd Boulevard in LaPorte. He attempted a traffic stop, but the driver didn\u2019t pull over. Instead, the driver fled, leading deputies on a short chase. \n \n Stop Sticks were deployed just before 6:30 p.m., the sheriff\u2019s office said. \n \n \u201cHe ran over a couple of sets of Stop Sticks that some of our sergeants had laid out, so his tires were going flat. He lost control of the vehicle and slid into a snowbank,\u201d Deputy Wright told 24 Hour News 8. \n \n That snowbank was at the T-intersection of N 250 E between East Division and E 150 N in Kankakee Township, east of LaPorte. \n \n Elliot then tried to climb out of the car\u2019s window, Wright said. Deputies Czupryna and Wright each grabbed one of Elliot\u2019s shoulders, pulled him from the car, laid him on the ground and handcuffed him. No one was hurt. \n \n When asked what his name was, Elliot answered truthfully, Wright said. He said he asked Elliot if he was \u201c\u2018the Michael Elliot,\u201d and Elliot confirmed he was the escapee. Wright said he was surprised that Elliot didn\u2019t lie about his identity. \n \n Wright then put Elliot into the back of his cruiser and took him to the LaPorte County Jail. Elliot is being held without bond on felony car theft and resisting charges. \n \n Wright described Elliot was polite to officers, and quiet and emotionless during the ride to jail. Elliot looked tired, Wright said, like he had not slept in days. Wright said Elliot was wearing jeans that were too big and \u201ca couple of jackets.\u201d \n \n Wright said authorities didn\u2019t know Elliot would be in their area \u2014 there was more concern he may be in the Shipshewana area \u2014 and that he did not expect the man he was chasing to be Elliot. Wright said he was relieved that he and Czupryna were able to get Elliot off the streets and bring worried citizens some peace of mind. \n \n In a Monday night news release, Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder thanked the law enforcement agencies that aided in the search and capture of Elliot. \u201cThe swift apprehension of this dangerous criminal is a credit to law enforcement and corrections officials in Michigan and Indiana, and our partners with the U.S. Marshals Service. Their courage, diligence and professionalism reminds us how fortunate we are to have such men and women who are willing to keep our communities safe. \u2026Now that we are assured the public is safe, we will turn our attention to thoroughly reviewing the situation that led to the prisoner\u2019s escape. We will demand an exhaustive assessment of the incident and take whatever appropriate action is needed to prevent future incidents.\u201d \n \n Elliot escaped around 7 p.m. Sunday from the Ionia Correctional Facility, but jail workers didn\u2019t notice he was missing until a routine prisoner check at 9 p.m. \n \n Authorities said Elliot left through the sally port, a secured garage where prisoners are brought into the facility. Elliot then got through a hole in the fencing system which, according to a former corrections officer, is made up of two 12-foot high, razor wire-topped fencing sections with a smaller, electrified fence in between them. \n \n He then made a three-and-a-half mile trek into Ionia where he carjacked a woman, police said. The two then drove to the Elkhart, Ind. area. The woman escaped at a gas station there and he fled in her Jeep Liberty. That SUV was found early Monday morning in Shipshewana, Ind. \n \n LaPorte County, where Elliot was arrested, is west of Shipshewana. \n \n Elliot was serving five life sentences in the Ionia Correctional Facility after being convicted of four 1993 murders. \n \n In the early morning of Aug. 8, 1993, according to court documents, Elliot broke into a home in Bentley Township, north of Midland, killed four people then set the house on fire. Vickie Currie, her boyfriend Michael Tufnell, his cousin Bruce Squires Tufnell Jr. and fiancee Cathy Lave were killed. \n \n Charles and Paul Treece, and Tammy LaCross were with Elliot when the murders were committed. Charles Treece was also convicted of four counts of first-degree murder, armed robbery and setting a house on fire, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a firearm. He is also serving life in prison at the Alger Correctional Facility in Munising in the Upper Peninsula. \n \n LaCross, who was 16 at the time and is victim Vickie Currie\u2019s daughter, and Paul Treece both testified against Elliot. Under the terms of plea agreements, they pleaded guilty to robbery and felony firearm charges. \n \n In 2005, Elliot filed a motion for release, saying that there was new evidence in his case \u2014 namely a 1994 letter from Charles Treece that attested to Elliot\u2019s innocence. A state court denied his request. \n \n Elliot maintains he is innocent, according to the court documents. \n \n \u2014\u2013 \n \n Inside woodtv.com: \n \n Michael Elliot escapes from Ionia Correctional Facility \n \n Former guard: Elliot\u2019s escape a \u2018mystery\u2019 \n \n \u2018Thorough\u2019 investigation of escape promised \n \n Son \u2018proud\u2019 of Elliot\u2019s carjack victim for staying calm \n \n Victim\u2019s mother worried Elliot would kill again \n \n Life as a Level II prison inmate \n \n Share this: Email \n \n Print \n \n Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Google \n \n Pinterest \n \n More \n \n LinkedIn \n \n Tumblr \n \n \n \n Reddit \n \n ||||| More Video... \n \n A source close to the investigation tells NewsCenter 16 convicted murderer Michael Elliot was arrested in LaPorte County after a chase Monday night. \n \n The manhunt for 40-year- old Elliot started Sunday night, after he escaped from Ionia Correctional Facility in Michigan. \n \n Elliot was convicted of four murders in 1993 and is serving five life sentences. \n \n Michigan Department of Corrections Director Dan Heyns says officers realized Elliot was gone during a routine count at about 9 p.m. Sunday. After looking at surveillance tapes, they realized he escaped somewhere between 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. \n \n Heyns says during the time of the escape, Elliot was dressed in a white kitchen uniform. It is unknown at this time how he got that uniform. Heyns says Elliot was not assigned to the kitchen. \n \n They believe it was the color of that uniform that had something to do with his ability to get by multiple security cameras and interior and perimeter fencing. \n \n After escaping, Elliot carjacked a woman using a box cutter. He held her hostage during the more than 100-mile drive to Elkhart County. \n \n They stopped for gas around 11 p.m. at a Marathon gas station near the intersection of SR 13 and CR 2, near Middlebury. The woman escaped Elliot at the station by asking for a cup for water, then locking herself in the bathroom and calling 911. \n \n Elliot fled in the victim's car before police arrived. \n \n Indiana State Police say the red Jeep Liberty he fled in was found in the 400 block of North State Street in Shipshewana Monday afternoon. A woman living in the neighborhood noticed the car matched the description of one given on the news, so she called police around 12:15 p.m. But, police say the car was seen in the area as early as 5:30 a.m. \n \n \"You can go a lot of places in seven hours,\" said Sgt. Ron Galaviz with the Indiana State Police. \"Especially if you have a mode of transportation. And, I'm not suggesting he does. But, again, we're looking for stolen vehicle reports or anything of that nature to help follow up on, to help us pursue on that trail.\" \n \n Police went door-to-door looking for any signs of Elliot in Shipshewana. Westview Schools were notified of the situation and placed on lock down. Students were later dismissed, with a heavy police presence on site to ensure their safety. Police say all students were accounted for and the schools were thoroughly searched. \n \n Indiana State Police say after searching the community, their hunt for Elliot in Shipshewana has been suspended and they have no new leads. They don't know if he is still in Michiana or has traveled elsewhere since abandoning the Jeep. \n \n \"What we're asking the public to do is to remain vigilant,\" Galaviz said. \"If you see something, say something. If something appears out of order, if a door seems unlocked, if a window is broken, don't investigate it. Call 911.\" \n \n \\NBC affiliate WSMV in Nashville says early Monday morning, a woman thought she spotted Elliot at a Tennessee gas station. But, police say it was a false identification. Elliot has family in Tennessee. \n \n He is described as a 5'8, 165-pound white male with brown hair and eyes. Elliot was wearing a blue and orange state prison uniform when he escaped, but he was last seen in black pants, a white t-shirt, white tennis shoes and a white beanie cap. \n \n Elliot should be considered armed and dangerous. Anyone who comes in contact with him, should contact law enforcement immediately. \n \n According to Grand Rapids-based WOOD-TV, Elliot was serving five life sentences for four murders and an armed robbery. He was convicted in 1993. He was also serving 13 years for setting a house on fire and two years for using a firearm during the commission of a felony.",

Cheers erupted and music blared when TVs showed him as the winner. \n \n \"Nine months ago, if you told somebody that we would win the New Hampshire primary, they would not have believed you,\" Sanders wrote in a fundraising appeal to supporters asking for $3 a pop. \"Not at all. Too bold, they would have said. Not enough money to compete against the billionaires. You showed them tonight.\" \n \n In her own message to supporters, Clinton wrote that she \"[wished] tonight had gone differently.\" \n \n \n \n \"But I know what it's like to be knocked down -- and I've learned from long experience that it's not whether you get knocked down that matters. It's about whether you get back up,\" she wrote. \n \n The Clinton campaign released a separate memo Tuesday evening mapping out the candidate's way forward. \n \n \"The nomination will very likely be won in March, not February, and we believe that Hillary Clinton is well positioned to build a strong \u2013 potentially insurmountable \u2013 delegate lead next month,\" campaign manager Robby Mook wrote in the memo, which touted the importance of next month and Super Tuesday in particular. \n \n The campaign also emphasized Clinton's strength among Hispanic and African American voters, as well as her broader appeal beyond Iowa and New Hampshire. \n \n \"Additionally, as the campaign moves to states with a heavier presence of military personnel and veterans, Sen. Sanders should expect renewed questions about his foreign policy proposals and preparedness to be Commander-in-Chief,\" Mook wrote, also pointing to the campaign's \"data-driven operation\" to get out the vote in the months to come. \n \n \"We believe that Hillary\u2019s unique level of strength among African Americans, Hispanics, women and working families of all backgrounds \u2013 combined with the most data-driven and targeted campaign ever waged \u2013 will net the delegates in March needed to put her on a clear path to the nomination,\" he wrote in the memo. \n \n Exit poll data from NBC News suggested that 55 percent of primary voters had made up their mind before last month, while just 23 percent said they had waited until the last few days. CNN's exit poll data showed similar results. \n \n Earlier Tuesday, Devine told MSNBC's \"MTP Daily\" that the margin of victory was important. \n \n \u201cYes, I mean I think if we have a substantial victory, that will help us even more,\" he said, noting the importance of bringing in younger and independent voters.\"I think that\u2019s an important case that we\u2019d want to prove,\" he added. \n \n Moments earlier, Mook told Chuck Todd that their operation is prepared for an \"uphill climb\" after Tuesday's primary. \n \n Eight years ago, after a humbling third-place Iowa finish, Clinton staged a come-from-behind win in New Hampshire that rescued her campaign. This time, Clinton eked out a win in Iowa, but New Hampshire never looked nearly as kind to her. \n \n For his part, Sanders achieved a bit of history with his victory, becoming the first Jewish candidate to win a primary, something that previous contenders such as Joe Lieberman, Arlen Specter and Milton Shapp were unable to achieve. \n \n The high stakes for both sides in the first-in-the-nation primary have been on glaring display all week long. \n \n In their first head-to-head debate last Thursday in Durham, New Hampshire, the two candidates dropped the comity of the first four debates for a bruising, two-hour rumble. In one memorable clash, Sanders attacked Clinton over her paid speeches to Goldman Sachs; Clinton responded that her rival was leveling a \"very artful smear\" of corruption against her: \"Enough is enough,\" she admonished. \"If you've got something to say, say it.\" \n \n Since then, though, Clinton has been on the defensive. After being asked at the debate whether she would release transcripts of her paid speeches, at first she said that she would \"look into\" it, but then struck a less amenable tone. \u201cLet everybody who\u2019s ever given a speech to any private group under any circumstances release them,\u201d Clinton told ABC. \u201cWe\u2019ll all release them at the same time.\u201d \n \n Generational and gender tensions between the two candidates' supporters grew more pronounced over the weekend. Feminist icon Gloria Steinem declared to Bill Maher that young women are only supporting Sanders because \"the boys are with Bernie,\" then later apologized. Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a Clinton surrogate, trotted out her maxim, \"There\u2019s a special place in hell for women who don\u2019t help each other.\" Sanders disavowed a group of supporters calling themselves \"Berniebros,\" saying, \"Anybody who is supporting me and doing sexist things, we don't want them.\" \n \n Former President Bill Clinton got into the act, too, denouncing Sanders (without mentioning him by name) as \"the champion of all things small and the enemy of all things big.\u201d \n \n Clinton had tried to tamp down expectations, saying some pundits have argued she would have been better off skipping the state. On Saturday, both candidates took brief detours from campaigning in the state: Clinton went to Flint, Michigan, to address the water crisis; Sanders traveled to New York City for a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit with his spot-on impersonator, Larry David. \n \n Gabriel Debenedetti contributed reporting from Concord, New Hampshire. ||||| AP Photo Trump: 'We are going to win so much' \n \n Donald Trump was magnanimous in declaring victory Tuesday night \u2014 but all signs of his immediate post-Iowa humility were gone. \n \n Instead, he was back to boasting about \"winning\" and pledging to make American great again, while taking slams at Democratic winner Bernie Sanders and totally ignoring Hillary Clinton. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n \u201cWe are going to start winning again and we are going to win so much,\" Trump said at his victory party in Manchester, two hours after news outlets declared him the victor in the New Hampshire GOP primary. \"You are going to be so happy.\u201d \n \n He immediately blasted Sanders, who had given his own victory speech just before him. \n \n \u201cI heard parts of Bernie\u2019s speech,\" Trump said. \"He wants to give away our country, folks.\u201d \n \n But Trump also struck populist notes similar to those Sanders had sounded, trumpeting what he called his self-funded campaign and his independence from lobbyists and special interests. \u201cI think one of the things that really caught on \u2014 self-funding my campaign,\u201d Trump said. \n \n \u201cWe are now going to make [deals] for your benefit,\" he added. \"We are going to make the deals for the American people.\u201d \n \n Trump never mentioned Clinton, who trailed Sanders by more than 20 points with more than three-quarters of the results in. \n \n He nodded only obliquely to his second-place finish in Iowa behind Ted Cruz. \n \n \"You know, we learned a lot about ground games in one week, I have to tell you,\u201d he said. \n \n Trump acted the part of the GOP front-runner at the start of his speech, thanking Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and congratulating the Republicans who had finished far behind him \u2014 though he quickly moved on. \u201cNow that I got that over with...,\u201d he said. \n \n Trump reiterated many of the campaign pledges he's been making for months: rebuilding the military, taking care of veterans, protecting the Second Amendment and building a wall on the Mexican border. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to build a wall,\" he said. \"It\u2019s going to be built.

If the death penalty is not sought, a conviction on the kidnapping count would call for mandatory life without parole. \n \n Christensen, who is being held without bond, is tentatively set to go to trial Feb. 27 before U.S. District Court Judge Colin Bruce.

Shortly after, federal authorities allege that Christensen approached Zhang in his car and lured her inside. \n \n Surveillance video from a nearby parking garage captured the exchange in which Zhang could be seen speaking to the driver for several moments before getting into the front passenger seat.

The text of the letter follows:Dear Bob,We\u2019ve known each other for a long time, and have worked together on many issues that are important to the people of San Diego \u2013 from creating jobs to protecting the environment to helping our veterans.So I am speaking to you now on a personal and professional level, and asking you to step down as mayor and get the help you need as a private citizen.I have already said publicly that you should resign your office as mayor because of the shocking revelations by many women about your behavior toward them.But now I must say this directly to you: Bob, you must resign because you have betrayed the trust of the women you have victimized, the San Diegans you represent and the people you have worked with throughout your decades in public life.I have worked for so many years to prevent and punish sexual violence and sexual harassment, wherever they occur. As we fight in the Senate to stand up for the men and women in our military who are survivors of sexual assault, I have heard their stories, seen the anguish in their faces, listened to them talk about the pain that will always be with them. Let me be clear: The latest revelations regarding your behavior toward women recovering from sexual assault \u2013 women who desperately need our help \u2013 have shaken me to my core.Bob, you have already hurt so many people. To avoid hurting your victims and the people of San Diego more than you already have, you should step down immediately.Sincerely,Barbara ||||| SAN DIEGO \u2014 Mayor Bob Filner will complete his \"voluntary\" behavioral modification therapy on Saturday, earlier than anticipated, his lawyers said Friday. \n \n Filner will take \"some personal time\" and be unavailable for comment, said a statement by the law firm of Payne & Fears, which is assisting Filner in his defense against a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by a former staff member. He is set to return to City Hall on Aug. 19. \n \n Filner will continue therapy as an outpatient, his lawyers said. \n \n Filner had said he would be in the intensive therapy program the weeks of Aug. 5 and 12. But he reportedly started the program earlier than announced. \n \n The law firm's announcement came as the last two City Council members called for Filner to bow to numerous demands that he resign and \"allow the healing of our city to begin.\" \n \n The call by Marti Emerald and Myrtle Cole, both Democrats, makes it unanimous: All nine council members want Filner gone because of accusations that he sexually harassed numerous women. \n \n Also Friday, U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a longtime ally, issued an open letter addressed to \"Dear Bob,\" asking him to resign and seek long-term treatment. Boxer's letter had a personal tone, noting their long careers working for many of the same political causes. \n \n \"Bob, you have already hurt so many people,\" Boxer wrote. \"To avoid hurting your victims and the people of San Diego more than you already have, you should step down immediately.\" \n \n Filner, 70, elected in November as San Diego's first Democratic mayor in two decades, is hoping to ride out a tide of sexual misconduct accusations and demands by fellow politicians and others for him to resign. \n \n Some 14 women have accused Filner of making unwanted and unpleasant sexual advances. One, former communications director Irene McCormack Jackson, has filed a sexual harassment lawsuit in San Diego County Superior Court seeking unspecified damages. \n \n The accusations of the other 13 share a similar scenario: that they met Filner at a public event or while asking for his help on a public issue and that he made sexually inappropriate comments, asked them for dates, and, in some cases, kissed or touched them. \n \n Among the 13 are prominent businesswomen, a retired Navy admiral, a political consultant, two college officials, a nurse seeking help for a wounded Marine and a longtime city employee. \n \n Emerald and Cole said the breaking point came when two former military personnel, both victims of sexual assault during their military service, accused Filner of making crude advances starting at a conference designed to help women who have suffered sexual assault. \n \n Filner's alleged victims are being interviewed by San Diego County Sheriff's Department investigators and personnel from the state attorney general's office. \n \n With reporters scrambling to find where Filner was receiving the therapy, the most likely candidate was the Sexual Recovery Institute in Los Angeles. \n \n Founded in 1995, the Pico-Robertson clinic specializes in helping men who cannot \"take a month away from work to deal with their compulsive behavior\" but want a \"treatment program that could cover the same territory in half the time.\" \n \n The clinic's website says it is \"the nation's only comprehensive two-week intensive treatment program for sexual addiction.\" \n \n The institute has a program for the weeks of Aug. 5 and 12, when Filner announced that he would be undergoing therapy to begin to change a long pattern of disrespectful, abusive behavior toward women. \n \n A spokeswoman for the clinic declined Friday to confirm or deny that Filner was a client, citing federal laws about confidentiality of medical information. \n \n The clinic attempts to shield the privacy of its clients. Staffers this week ordered television reporters parked near the facility to move as clients were arriving in a van. \n \n In a video on the institute's website, founder Rob Weiss, a clinical social worker and sex addiction therapist, said the clinic helps people who have successful lives that are being disrupted by compulsive behavior involving sex. \n \n \"We can help restore some integrity to your life,\" Weiss said. \n \n tony.perry@latimes.com ||||| Mayor Bob Filner is ending his intensive behavioral therapy triggered by sexual harassment allegations earlier than expected while officials on Friday said the locks had been changed at his office. \n \n Meanwhile, his political support continued to crater as his last two allies on the City Council called for his resignation, making it unanimous, and U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer reiterated her call for him to step down in an impassioned open letter to the mayor. \n \n It was another head-snapping day in the monthlong scandal that has enveloped City Hall as investigations by state, federal and local agencies continue into the sexual harassment claims and more. \n \n City Attorney Jan Goldsmith confirmed that the locks were changed at the 11th-floor City Hall office of the mayor but said he couldn\u2019t say why. \n \n On Saturday, Filner Chief of Staff Lee Burdick explained. \n \n \"The fact is that I had the locks changed to protect the Mayor while he is away,\" Burdick told the Voice of San Diego via email. \"My concern is/was that if anything was removed while the Mayor was away, it could raise all kinds of questions about preservation or spoliation of potential evidence. Because I could not possibly determine everyone who had keys, I believed it was necessary to ensure the integrity of his physical office in his absence. The Mayor will be given the keys upon his return.\" \n \n She did not respond to requests for comment from U-T San Diego. \n \n An attorney hired by Filner to represent him in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by his former top communications aide, Irene McCormack Jackson, said Filner will continue his therapy as an outpatient. \n \n \u201cUpon completion of the treatment program, Mayor Filner is planning to continue therapy sessions on an outpatient basis,\u201d said a statement from the office of attorney, James L. Payne of Los Angeles. \u201cMayor Filner is taking personal time next week and will be unavailable for comment. At this time, we do not have information as to when he will be available for comment.\u201d \n \n Bob Filner leaves therapy \n \n The statement raised some confusion, saying Filner wouldn\u2019t be completing his two-week intensive treatment program until Saturday. Burdick said he had already completed the program, according to news reports. \n \n That distinction is noteworthy because Filner was originally scheduled to give a deposition in the sexual harassment case on Friday but he received a delay because it would conflict with his treatment. He had said he would begin the program this past Monday, Aug. 5, and return to work Aug. 19. \n \n Even before all those developments, the day started out with big news: Councilwomen Myrtle Cole and Marti Emerald issued a joint statement demanding Filner resign, in which they said that more of his female staffers are reporting inappropriate behavior by the mayor. \n \n \u201cNow, additional women in his own office are telling investigators about harassment and abuse they suffered on a daily basis,\u201d their statement said. \u201cBased upon the ongoing disclosure of evidence Mayor Filner\u2019s conduct is reprehensible and cannot be excused.\u201d \n \n Cole and Emerald, who had held out calling for Filner to step down, started of their statement by saying \u201cenough is enough.\u201d",

That's in no small measure because he was, as JMart memorably put it earlier this year, a neon stand-in for the type of candidate that GOP primary voters wanted \u2014 someone who would take the fight to President Barack Obama. \n \n The idea that Trump would end up being among the most impactful players on the GOP primary would have been inconceivable earlier this year. But the reality is that the candidates have, at various levels, parroted parts of his message \u2014 and most of them have tried courting him for his endorsement. \n \n It's unclear whether any candidates have actually agreed to take part in the forum, which will be hosted by a man best known for his reality TV show, \"The Celebrity Apprentice.\" But given Trump's ability to command media attention, and his willingness to criticize if he disagrees with a candidate, candidates may feel compelled to attend. ||||| It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s officially a reality television Republican primary now. \n \n Donald Trump is pairing up with Newsmax, the conservative magazine and news Web site, to moderate a presidential debate in Des Moines on Dec. 27. \n \n \u201cOur readers and the grass roots really love Trump,\u201d said Christopher Ruddy, chief executive of Newsmax Media. \u201cThey may not agree with \n \n him on everything, but they don\u2019t see him as owned by the Washington establishment, the media establishment.\u201d \n \n \n \n Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s role in the debate, which will be broadcast on the cable network Ion Television, is sure to be one of the more memorable moments in a primary season that has already delivered its fair share of circus-like spectacle. \n \n Mr. Trump\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s own flirtation with running for president this year seems almost quaint (whose birth certificate was he all worked up about?) compared with more recent distractions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c like allegations of adultery and sexual harassment, gaffes that seemed scripted from a late-night comedy show, and a six-figure line of credit at Tiffany & Co. \n \n But despite being derided by liberals \u00e2\u20ac\u201c President Obama likened Mr. Trump to a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153carnival barker\u00e2\u20ac? for his repeated assertions that the president was actually foreign-born \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the real estate mogul carries weight with a certain element of the conservative base. And that sway seems particularly strong with the Tea Party wing of the base, which will be a decisive factor in the early primaries that are likely to determine the nominee. The debate, which unlike many recent ones will not be limited to a specific topic like national security or the economy, is set to happen just a week before the Iowa caucuses. \n \n Newsmax sent candidates the invitation on Friday afternoon. It began, \u201cWe are pleased to cordially invite you to \u201cThe Newsmax Ion Television 2012 Presidential Debate,\u201d moderated by a truly great American, Mr. Donald J. Trump.\u201d Spokesmen for several candidates did not immediately respond to questions from The New York Times about whether they would accept. \n \n Though presidential candidates may initially balk at the idea of appearing in a debate where Mr. Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with his bombast and The Hair \u00e2\u20ac\u201c is the one posing the questions, they may ultimately see it as an invitation they can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t refuse. In fact many of the candidates have already met with him, some more publicly than others. Representative Michele Bachmann has sat down with Mr. Trump several times this year. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas had dinner with him at Jean Georges, the posh Manhattan restaurant. And Mitt Romney paid a visit but carefully avoided being photographed. \n \n And Newsmax is a powerful player itself. It has a broad reach into the conservative base, with monthly Web traffic second only to Fox News among sites with conservative-leaning audiences. \n \n Mr. Trump has been a popular attraction at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering in Washington. He was such a successful presence in the eyes of Fox News executives that they added a special weekly segment to their morning show \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fox and Friends\u00e2\u20ac? for him called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mondays With Trump.\u00e2\u20ac? \n \n Whether his professed presidential ambitions are genuine or merely a publicity stunt seems not to matter in terms of the news media attention Mr. Trump can command. His highly publicized flirtation with running this year coincided with a Trump-branded product that stood to benefit from all the attention \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a new season of his highly rated NBC show \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Celebrity Apprentice.\u00e2\u20ac? \n \n The arc of his noncampaign was similar in 1987 and 1999 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c when Mr. Trump also said that he was considering running for president, episodes that are often forgotten. \n \n His book \u201dTrump: The Art of the Deal\u201d was published in November 1987 and reached The New York Times best-seller list by December. But by the time the Republican National Convention rolled around in August 1988, he had opted out. \n \n \u201dEverybody wants me to do it,\u201d he declared then. \u201dBut I have no interest in doing it.\u201d \n \n And in late 1999, just before his book \u201dThe America We Deserve\u201d went on sale, he began courting support as a candidate on the Reform Party ticket. He even toured the country with his girlfriend, Melania Knauss, now his wife. The outcome? You guessed it.",

In a televised address he said: \u201cI regret and reject the decision of the US to build the wall.\u201d \n \n But Pe\u00f1a Nieto did not cancel a trip to Washington \u2013 a move many in Mexico had demanded after Trump signed an executive order to start plans for fencing off the frontier. \n \n \n \n \u201cI have said time and time again, Mexico will not pay for any wall,\u201d Pe\u00f1a Nieto told the nation in his short video statement on Wednesday night. \n \n \u201cMexico reaffirms its friendship with the people of the United States and its willingness to reach agreements with its government.\u201d \n \n He left up in the air the question of the 31 January meeting with Trump in the White House \u2013 saying his decision would depend on an evaluation by a team already in Washington and officials at home. \n \n Mexicans reacted to the president\u2019s statement with confusion. Many in the political class had called on Pe\u00f1a Nieto to cancel his meeting after Trump signed the executive order. \n \n A senior government official told the Associated Press that the Mexican president was \u201cconsidering\u201d calling off the visit to Washington, but no decision had been taken. \n \n On Thursday, Trump appeared to be goading his Mexican counterpart into pulling out of the visit, saying on Twitter: \u201cIf Mexico is unwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.\u201d \n \n Cuauht\u00e9moc C\u00e1rdenas, a leftist former presidential candidate, told an audience in Mexico City: \u201cIf a [Mexican] presidential visit is being announced, he will be received there by having the door slammed in his face. \n \n \u201cI think the least we can do in these conditions would be not to show up, cancel the visit to the United States and find a dignified position for Mexico.\u201d \n \n Pe\u00f1a Nieto has encountered sustained criticism for failing to come up with a decisive strategy to deal with Trump\u2019s combative policies. \n \n Trump repeatedly promised a border wall throughout his election campaign but Mexico\u2019s political elite appeared to be hoping that the billionaire-turned-populist politician had been bluffing. \n \n \n \n Trump's wall: Mexican construction firms likely to be biggest winners Read more \n \n That hope proved misplaced on Wednesday, when the US president signed the order, proclaiming: \u201cA nation without borders is not a nation.\u201d \n \n Trump claimed that \u201cwe\u2019re in the middle of a crisis on our southern border\u201d, citing an \u201cunprecedented surge\u201d of illegal immigrants from Central America that was harming both the US and Mexico. \n \n The likely effectiveness of the planned wall is fiercely disputed. More Mexican immigrants have returned to Mexico from the US than have migrated to the US since the end of the 2007-08 financial crisis, according to the Pew Research Center. Research shows that immigrants are more law-abiding than non-immigrants. \n \n Pe\u00f1a Nieto has consistently rejected Trump\u2019s suggestion that Mexico will pay for the border wall and promised to put Mexico first in any negotiations. \n \n \n \n But analysts say the president has few strong options in confronting an American administration considered the most hostile to Mexico since the Mexican-American war of the 1840s \u2013 in which Mexico was forced to cede its northern territory. \n \n Pe\u00f1a Nieto \u2013 whose personal popularity ratings currently languish at 12% (the lowest in history) \u2013 appears to be caught in an impossible situation: paying for the wall would stoke domestic outrage. Not paying could provoke problems with Trump\u2019s team, however. \n \n \u201cThe whole thing is lose-lose. The only question is how much,\u201d said Esteban Illades, editor of the Mexican magazine Nexos. \n \n Trump\u2019s executive order to build a wall along the nearly 2,000-mile US-Mexico border came on the same day Mexico\u2019s foreign minister Luis Videgary and economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo met with senior Trump administration officials. \n \n \u201cI would cancel the meeting [with Trump] or postpone it as a message that we\u2019re not going to do what they want, that we\u2019re not going to play their game,\u201d Agust\u00edn Basave, ex-leader of the left-leaning Democratic Revolution party, told the newspaper Reforma. \u201cI would start by saying things like we are going to review Mexico\u2019s cooperation in the areas of security and migration.\u201d \n \n \n \n Others were even more direct, including ex-president Vicente Fox \u2013 who has walloped Trump with profanity-laden tweets for more than a year. \n \n Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) Sean Spicer, I've said this to @realDonaldTrump and now I'll tell you: Mexico is not going to pay for that fucking wall. #FuckingWall \n \n Let's raise our voices against this dictator, Donald Trump | Vicente Fox Read more \n \n Mexican officials have expressed hopes of salvaging Nafta, which facilitates more than $500bn annually in cross-border trade, though Guajardo told Mexican TV earlier this week that Mexico would consider walking away from the deal. \n \n Canadian officials have also mused about abandoning Mexico to forge a bilateral deal with the US if necessary, leaving Mexico\u2019s increasingly export-oriented economy in a bind. \n \n \u201cIf we\u2019re going for something that is less than what we have now, it doesn\u2019t make sense to stay in,\u201d Guajardo told the Televisa network. \n \n Until recently, such a posture would have been unthinkable as Mexico shifted its economy from one so closed that smuggled candy was sold in itinerant markets to one so open it has more than 40 free-trade deals with countries around the world. \n \n But moving away from the massive US market has proved difficult for Mexico, which sends 80% of its exports north. Pe\u00f1a Nieto told the nation Monday that Mexico would seek stronger ties with countries in the hemisphere, but promptly cancelled his participation in a summit of Latin American and Caribbean countries. \n \n Trump's Mexico bashing may backfire if peso plunge forces poor migrants north Read more \n \n \u201cThe cancelation was given in such short notice that it raises suspicions that Pe\u00f1a Nieto would not want to meet with other leaders who would want a strongly worded statement against Trump,\u201d Illades said. \n \n Pe\u00f1a Nieto has promised to impose conditions on any negotiation with the US, including addressing issues such as smuggled guns streaming across the border, arming drug cartels, and Mexico\u2019s efforts to detain and deport migrants who transit its territory in attempts to reach the US. \n \n But the president is playing a weak hand, while his approval rating of just 12% is hampering his attempts at fomenting unity in a time of crisis. \n \n \u201cThere is unity; people do not like Trump,\u201d says Rodolfo Soriano-N\u00fa\u00f1ez, a sociologist in Mexico City, \u201cbut there is this sense that Trump is not the real problem, rather trust in a presidency ridden with scandals.\u201d \n \n Additional reporting by David Smith ||||| During his presidential campaign, no single promise electrified Donald Trump\u2019s supporters more than the pledge to build a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d all along the border with Mexico. \n \n Wednesday, President Trump turned that promise into an executive order, one of two he signed. His directive leaves many questions unanswered about what sort of wall might be built, how much it would cost and how it would be paid for. \n \n The two orders, however, do begin the crackdown on illegal immigration that Trump promised his supporters. In addition to the wall, he would greatly expand deportations and detention of migrants and block federal money for so-called sanctuary cities. \n \n Some of the actions will be felt immediately, some require more cash from Congress, others will only take effect over time. \n \n Here\u2019s a look at what the actions mean and what they don\u2019t. \n \n Border wall \n \n Trump ordered the \u201cimmediate construction of a physical wall on the southern border\u201d and gave the Homeland Security department six months to study how to prevent \u201call unlawful entries\u201d into the U.S. \u2014 a goal that is widely considered impossible. But \u201cimmediate construction\u201d doesn\u2019t mean a wall will be built all along the 2,000 miles of the Mexican border any time soon. Trump\u2019s order directs Homeland Security to come up with a long-term plan for getting it done. \n \n Cost estimates for walling off the entire border run from $12 billion to $38 billion, and the barriers would cost billions more to maintain over time. \n \n Trump could tap some existing federal funds to begin construction. U.S. Customs and Border Protection already has budgeted $175 million for \"procurement, construction and improvements.\" That wouldn't be nearly enough to finish the job, but it would allow a start. \n \n Trump has famously said Mexico would pay for the wall. Mexican officials say no. Asking Mexico to pay for the wall is \u201cunacceptable,\u201d Mexico\u2019s foreign minister Luis Videgaray has said. \n \n Trump aides have floated the idea of taxing cash that flows back to Mexico from workers in the U.S. or using the wall construction as leverage in negotiations to change the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement. \n \n Trump promised Wednesday to help Mexico by stopping the flow of illegal cash and guns moving south from the U.S. He is scheduled to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto next week, but Pe\u00f1a Nieto is under pressure at home to cancel the meeting in the wake of Trump\u2019s announcement. \n \n Currently, about 600 miles of the border have some form of fence, ranging from the imposing barrier along parts of the California border to more traditional fencing elsewhere. Building all that already cost about $7 billion. The government uses walls and fencing in highly trafficked urban areas where border agents have only minutes to apprehend illegal crossers. Cameras and sensors are used in more remote areas. \n \n Border Patrol agents have long said that what they need to reduce illegal border crossings further is more of those cameras, sensors, vehicles and equipment and not more physical barriers. Smuggling cartels often use blow torches to cut holes through existing border walls or dig tunnels under them, they say. \n \n The government has has also increased the size of the Border Patrol from about 10,000 agents in 2004 to 21,000 today. Trump plans to add an additional 5,000 agents. \n \n The increase in security \u2014 plus economic changes in both the U.S. and Mexico \u2014 has meant fewer people are crossing back and forth over the border. The Pew Research Center estimates that in recent years, more Mexicans have been returning to Mexico than migrating to the U.S. \n \n There has been a dramatic increase in Central American migrants arriving at the border in Texas, but a large share of those people are not trying to evade capture. Instead, they quickly surrender to border agents and make claims for asylum, saying they are fleeing the violence in their home countries. \n \n Deporting more people \n \n Under Trump\u2019s plans, immigration officials will have much more freedom to deport people they find in the country illegally. President Obama tried to focus the deportation force on removing people with criminal records and those who pose a threat to public safety, and deportations from the interior of the country declined during Obama\u2019s second term. \n \n Trump dramatically expanded the list of people considered a priority for removal to include those charged with crimes, even if a trial has not yet been held, and those who have improperly received any welfare benefit. As a result, a lot more people will be unable to win reprieves from deportation even if they have strong family ties in the U.S. \n \n Immigration officials can act on these new priorities immediately. There are about 800,000 people in the U.S. who already have a final order of removal from an immigration judge and have either refused to leave or been allowed to stay temporarily, often because of the hardship their deportation would cause to family in the U.S. \n \n Also, countries that refuse to take back people being deported from the U.S. have been put on notice by the Trump administration that they must accept return of their citizens. About 23 countries currently don\u2019t accept deportations from the U.S., including Afghanistan, Algeria, China, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, and Zimbabwe. \n \n Courts have ruled that people from such countries can\u2019t be held indefinitely, even if they have a violent criminal conviction. As a result, more than 8,000 immigrants with criminal records have been released in the past three years. \n \n Trump also instructed immigration officials to expand the number and size of detention facilities to hold asylum seekers and people awaiting hearings in immigration court. Cases for people held in detention can move more quickly, and they can be deported faster than those released and told to appear in court. \n \n Advocates for immigrants are concerned about the poor conditions in detention facilities, many of which are also local jails and have a track record of substandard medical care. Also, immigrants in detention facilities have a much harder time getting lawyers.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Tension between President Trump and Mexico over his border wall plans was probably inevitable, though not everybody expected it to flare up before his administration was a week old. After Trump signed an executive order Wednesday and promised to start building the wall within months, Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto told his country in a televised address that Mexico \"does not believe in walls\" and will not pay for it, no matter what Trump says, the BBC reports. \"I regret and condemn the decision of the United States to continue construction of a wall that, for years, has divided us instead of uniting us,\" he said. In other coverage: Pe\u00f1a Nieto said Mexico still offers its friendship to the US, but he didn't confirm whether he plans to go ahead with his Jan. 31 meeting with Trump at the White House, the Guardian reports. Senior government officials said late Wednesday that the Mexican leader is thinking about calling it off. CNN reports that Pe\u00f1a Nieto said he would wait for an evaluation from Mexican officials in the US before confirming the visit to the US. He also said he had ordered government agencies, including the 50 Mexican consulates in the US, to step up protection for immigrants. The Washington Post looks at five major challenges the wall project will face, including rough terrain and the fact that most land along the border in Texas is privately owned. In Mexico, people are furious and are calling for a stern response to Trump's plans, reports the New York Times. \"It's like we are Charlie Brown and they are Lucy with the football,\" says former foreign minister Jorge Castaneda. \"Pe\u00f1a is a weak president in a weak country at a weak moment, but he has to find a way to get some official backbone.\" Historians say the last president to anger Mexico this much was Calvin Coolidge, who threatened to invade \"Soviet Mexico\" in the 1920s. The Los Angeles Times looks at the details of the border wall project and other immigration-related actions Trump unveiled Wednesday. His plan to withhold federal grants from \"sanctuary cities\" like LA is expected to start legal battles that will last for years.",
