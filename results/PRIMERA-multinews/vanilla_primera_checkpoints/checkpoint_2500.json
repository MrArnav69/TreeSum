    "document": "In a crisis, we say, we can't be sure how we'd react -- whether we'd run or freeze, scream or, as in a nightmare, be unable to make a sound. But four bystanders in Arizona now know that they kept Saturday's shooting rampage at a shopping center from becoming an even more catastrophic event, according to law enforcement officials.As it was, the attack killed six people, including a federal judge and a 9-year-old girl, and wounded 14, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who authorities say was the target of the attack.But if the gunman had been able to reload his semi-automatic pistol and keep firing, Pima County Sheriff Clarence Dupnik said Sunday, \"there would have been a huge, greater catastrophe.\"The gunman was thwarted in that effort by four unassuming people who were identified as Bill Badger, Patricia Maisch, Roger Salzgeber and Joseph Zamudio. Not one of them is willing to call himself a hero.Maisch, who looks more storybook grandmother than crime fighter, told reporters that she had not run from the scene of the attack because she feared she would be shot. But when she saw the gunman trying to reload, she made a move to grab the magazine.\"The two men that secured him were the heroes,\" Maisch, 61, told CNN. \"I just was an assistant in being able to get that magazine or clip.\"It was the self-described \"assistant,\" however, who created just enough of a distraction to allow two others -- Badger and Salzgeber -- to tackle the shooter. Then Zamudio, who had been inside a nearby Walgreens when the shooting started, helped hold down the assailant.Badger, 74, told WNEP television in Moosic, Pennsylvania: \"I asked him when we were holding him down, 'Why in the world would you do something like this?' and he wouldn't answer. He was only 22-years-old. He looked like a young kid to me when I saw him and just why would he do something like this? There's no reason and the concern of mine was to shoot a 9-year-old girl and to shoot innocent people, something has to be wrong.\"Badger, a retired Army colonel, said he had just done what anyone else would have done. \"Once you're in the military, you never retire,\" he said. \"You're always there to help the community and the people who are in danger.\"Salzgeber was even more reticent, declining to talk to reporters who telephone him and saying the authorities had promised him his name would not be released, according to The Arizona Republic. \"I'm totally stressed out about this,\" said Salzgeber, who was one of the top three signature collectors for Giffords petitions when she was qualifying to run for re-election in 2010. \"I'm not interested in talking.\"Zamudio said the gunman was already on the ground when he reached him. \"I laid on him and held him down, and made sure the gun was down,\" Zamudio said.The gunman, who authorities have identified as 22-year-old Jared Loughner, was armed with a 9-millimeter Glock semi-automatic, which FBI Director Robert Mueller said he had obtained last November. Mueller did not say where Loughner got the gun. CNN reported it was purchased at a store in Tucson.Federal prosecutors filed charges against Loughner Sunday afternoon, including one count of attempting to assassinate a member of Congress, two counts of killing an employee of the federal government and two counts of attempting to kill a federal employee. Mueller indicated that additional charges may be filed based on the continuing investigation.The criminal complaint said that investigators found a letter from Giffords in a safe at Loughner's house thanking him for attending one of her \"Congress on Your Corner\" meetings in 2007. The complaint added: \"Also recovered in the safe was an enveloped with handwriting on the envelope stating 'I planned ahead,' and 'My assassination' and the name 'Giffords' along with what appears to be Loughner's signature.\" ( See a copy of the complaint here ).Dupnik, who has received wide attention for his remarks Saturday attacking the amount of \"vitriol\" in political rhetoric that he said may contribute to violence, repeated that view with obvious emotion on Sunday and also lashed out at laws that let \"everybody\" carry guns.\"I think that when the rhetoric about hatred, about mistrust of government, about paranoia about how government operates and to try to inflame the public on a daily basis, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, has impact on people especially who are unbalanced personalities to begin with.\"Asked how he felt about Arizona's gun laws, Dupnik said of the state, \"I think we're the Tombstone of the United States of America.\"\"I have never been a proponent of letting everybody in this state carry weapons under any circumstances that they want and that's almost where we are,\" he said. \"The legislature at this time is proposing that students and teachers be allowed to have weapons in schools and in college. . . . That's the ridiculous state to where we have become.\"Dupnik was referring to a bill proposed by state Sen. Karen Johnson that would allow people 21 and older who have a concealed weapons permit to carry a firearm at public colleges and universities, where they are generally not allowed. She said that if a student or teacher was armed, they could act if a gunman tried to open fire on campus as had happened at Northern Illinois University in 2008 The 74-year-old Dupnik is a Democrat who, according to the Washington Post , \"is known for his colorful and often bluntly partisan commentary.\" He has called Arizona's new law cracking down on illegal immigration \"racist\" and \"stupid\" and has refused to enforce it. He has also described Tea Party partisans as \"bigots.\"Dupnik's Saturday remarks drew a rebuke from Arizona Sen. Jon Kyl, a Republican, who said on CBS' Face the Nation, \"I didn't really think that that had any part in a law enforcement briefing last night. It was speculation. And I don't think we should rush to speculate. I thought that the report that we just saw from Tucson seems to have it about right. We really don't know what motivated this young person except to know he was very mentally unstable.\" ||||| Patricia Maisch looks like a grandmother, but she is being hailed as a hero today for helping to stop alleged Tucson shooter Jared Loughner by wrestling away a fresh magazine of bullets as he tried to reload. \n \n Maisch, 61, effectively disarmed the shooter as several men pounced on him and threw him to ground. As they struggled to hold him down, Maisch joined the scrum on the ground, clinging to the gunman's ankles. \n \n Maisch and her fellow heroes -- identified as Bill Badger, Roger Sulzgeber and Joseph Zamudio -- stopped the carnage after 20 people were shot, including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Six people died. \n \n \"[I] knew right away it was a gun... I heard a continuation of shots,\" Maisch told a news conference today. \n \n Maisch, who has a crown of snow-white hair, was standing towards the back of the line to greet and snap a photo with Giffords at the \"Congress in Your Corner\" event at a Safeway grocery store. \n \n Speaking to the press today, Maisch recalled how she stopped Loughner as he tried to reload his Glock 9 mm weapon. \n \n \"I could see him coming. [He] shot the lady next to me,\" Maisch said. \n \n As he was shooting, she said, she was expecting to be hit and she wondered what it would feel like. \n \n There was \"lots of blood and confusion,\" she said. \n \n She considered trying to run away, she said, but thought that would make her more of a target, so she laid down on the ground. But then something unexpected happened. \n \n \"Then he was next to me on the ground,\" she said. \"The gentleman knocked him down. \n \n \"I kneeled over him. He was pulling a magazine [to reload] and I grabbed the magazine and secured that. I think the men got the gun, and I was able to get the magazine,\" she said. \n \n Maisch said Badger and Sulzgeber both sat on the gunman while she held his ankles down. Police said that Zimudie helped by hanging on to Loughner's legs. \n \n Sulzgeber was reportedly standing with his wife, third in line to meet with Giffords, while Zimudie was in the nearby Walgreens and came running out once he heard the shooting. \n \n \"I thought I would be shot. I am thankful for those two brave men,\" Maisch said. \"I am not a hero. The other guys are. I just assisted getting the clip.\" \n \n Badger, a 74-year-old retired army colonel living in Tucson, told Pottsville, Pa.'s Republican-Herald how he helped capture Loughner, and that he was grazed in the back of the head by a bullet. \n \n The Heroes of the Tucson Shooting \n \n \"I heard the shots but I thought they were fireworks at first,\" Badger told the newspaper. \"I wasn't sure they were shots until I actually saw the shooter, and I was sure he was really shooting bullets when I felt the sting on the back of my head.\" \n \n According to Badger, who the Republican-Herald confirmed was treated for an injury at a hospital, he was the first person standing next to a row of chairs leading to Giffords when the first shots rang out. \n \n Badger told the paper, \"I turned and saw him running down the line of people on the chairs. He ran between me and the store. Someone hit him with a chair and he flinched a little. That's when I grabbed his left arm. Someone grabbed his right arm and we got him to the ground. \n \n \"The other guy put his knee into the back of his neck and I grabbed him around the throat. We held him until police got there. While we had him on the ground I saw blood running and it wasn't until then I realized it was coming from the back of my head,\" Badger said. \n \n Speaking outside her home this evening, Maisch said that when she noticed that one of the men was bleeding from the head, she ran into the Safeway to get paper towels. \n \n \"I put a compress on the man's head while he was securing the shooter,\" she said.",

He can still appeal the sentence. \n \n El-Sobky faced a backlash from other TV talk show hosts and civilians who filed complaints to public prosecutors accusing him of insulting Egyptian women. \n \n Public prosecutors, who have the right to vet such complaints and to choose which ones to pursue, charged el-Sobky and took him to court on these grounds. \n \n \"We can criticize or reject the comments he made, but he did not commit a crime,\" said prominent rights lawyer Gamal Eid. \n \n Under President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, authorities have waged crackdowns against Islamists, then left-wing activists and finally against broader dissent.

According to the state-run Al-Ahram newspaper, el-Sobky said, \"Thirty percent of women have a readiness for immorality ... but cannot find someone to encourage them,\" while appearing on a TV show in December.

El-Sobky, who says his comments were taken out of context, has apologized. An appeal is scheduled for March 30.

    "document": "Rosemont authorities announced late Friday that they have closed the investigation into Kenneka Jenkins\u2019 death and determined it to be accidental, saying there is \u201cno evidence that indicates any other conclusion.\u201d \n \n However, lawyers for Jenkins\u2019 mother say graphic police photographs taken after Jenkins\u2019 body was found \u201craise more questions than answers.\u201d \n \n As part of a release of documents and videos related to the case, Rosemont officials on Friday posted on their website dozens of postmortem photographs of Jenkins taken while her body was still in the hotel freezer where she was found dead. \n \n Police showed the photographs to Jenkins\u2019 family on Thursday, and Sam Adam Jr., a lawyer for Jenkins\u2019 mother Tereasa Martin, called them \u201cgraphic and disturbing images (that) inexplicably show portions of Kenneka\u2019s body exposed.\u201d \n \n The release from Adam and Martin\u2019s other attorney, Larry Rogers Jr., said the photos were \u201cof a personal, private and indecent nature.\u201d \n \n Jenkins, 19, was found dead in a Rosemont hotel freezer Sept. 10, about 21 hours after she went missing following a party she attended in a ninth-floor room. \n \n According to Rosemont police reports, she was found on her side, face down, with her left arm underneath her, her right shoe off and a small cut on her right foot. \n \n The photographs show that Jenkins was still wearing the jeans and jean jacket shown in surveillance videos of her walking through the hotel before her death, but the shirt beneath her jacket \u201cwas pulled up exposing her breasts,\u201d a police report said. \n \n \u201cFrankly, the photos depicting how Kenneka was found raise more questions about what happened to Kenneka Jenkins than they answer,\u201d Rogers said in the news release. \n \n Scientists who have studied hypothermia have described a phenomenon known as \u201cparadoxical undressing,\u201d in which people freezing to death remove their clothing. \n \n \u201cIt is concluded that paradoxical undressing might be explained by changes in peripheral vasoconstriction (narrowing of blood vessels supplying the extremities) in the deeply hypothermic person,\u201d scientists wrote in a 1979 journal article. \u201cIt represents the last effort of the victim and is followed almost immediately by unconsciousness and death.\u201d \n \n In announcing in a press release Friday evening that they\u2019ve closed the case, Rosemont police outlined the scope of their investigation and said they found no evidence that Jenkins was the victim of foul play \u2014 contrary to the many conspiracy theories that have sprouted on social media. \n \n \u201cOur detective reported no signs of foul play throughout the whole investigation,\u201d said a statement from Police Chief Donald Stephens III. \u201cThere is no evidence that Ms. Jenkins was forced to drink alcohol or consume any narcotics while at the hotel.\u201d \n \n The statement added: \u201cWhile there were many theories, rumors and much speculation floating around social media regarding the death of Ms. Jenkins, none were supported with facts. While all leads and theories were investigated by our department, what we have reported throughout the investigation and again, today, are facts.\u201d \n \n Police said their investigation has generated 135 reports and involved interviews with 44 people, including 30 who were confirmed to have been in the hotel room at some point the night of the party. \n \n Authorities also viewed dozens of hours of surveillance video; conducted five photo line-ups; performed forensic analyses on four cellphones, including Jenkins\u2019; and submitted three search warrants and four preservation of evidence warrants. \n \n The police statement said the \u201cdeath and circumstances surrounding are especially sad.\u201d \n \n Reached by phone Friday evening, Martin declined to comment on the photographs and the village\u2019s decision to post them on its website. Martin referred calls to her attorneys, who could not immediately be reached. \n \n In a news release Thursday evening, the lawyers said the death-scene photos were first shown to the family by Rosemont police during a meeting to update the family on the death investigation. \n \n The lawyers also said Rosemont police had previously denied \u201cnumerous requests to review the reports, photographs and videos secured by the department.\u201d \n \n \u201cNumerous requests for any and all videos and photos showing Ms. Jenkins going into the freezer of her own volition have not been forthcoming, and quite frankly raise more questions than answers as to how and why Ms. Jenkins was found in the condition in which she was located,\u201d the attorneys also said. \n \n There has been no indication from police that any surveillance video exists that directly shows Jenkins entering the freezer where she was found. But motion-sensor cameras in the kitchen indicate no one else went into the freezer area of the kitchen for days prior to Jenkins entering the kitchen, and no one entered the area after that until the time her body was discovered, according to police reports and surveillance video. \n \n The Cook County Medical Examiner\u2019s office had already classified Jenkins\u2019 death as accidental and caused by hypothermia, with alcohol intoxication listed as a contributing factor. \n \n Rosemont police also said in their release Friday that the hotel room where the party took place was booked with a fraudulent credit card and that they believe they have identified two perpetrators who booked the room. Police said they are \u201caffiliated with a gang on the West Side of Chicago whose operations rely heavily on the use of fraudulent credit cards.\u201d \n \n Police said that case is still ongoing. \n \n RELATED: \n \n Kenneka Jenkins' freezer-death timeline comes into focus with audio, video, police reports \u00bb \n \n Tribune coverage of Kenneka Jenkins' death \u00bb \n \n Medical examiner: Kenneka Jenkins died from exposure, and her death was an accident \u00bb \n \n Autopsy and toxicology report on Kenneka Jenkins' death \u00bb ||||| (CNN) Authorities have closed the investigation into the death of a young Chicago woman whose body was found in a hotel's walk-in freezer, saying it was accidental and there was no reason to suspect foul play. \n \n Police in Rosemont, a suburb northwest of Chicago, had been investigating the death of 19-year-old Kenneka Jenkins since her body was found September 10 after she attended a party at the Crowne Plaza Chicago O'Hare Hotel. \n \n \"Our detectives reported no signs of foul play throughout the whole investigation,\" Chief Donald E. Stephens III with the Rosemont Police Department said in a statement. \"There is no evidence that Ms. Jenkins was forced to drink alcohol or consume any narcotics while at the hotel.\" \n \n Investigators concluded Jenkin's death was accidental after retracing her path to the cooler that contained the freezer where her body was found, reviewing hours of surveillance video and interviewing most of the people that were at the party that night. \n \n \"There is no evidence that indicates any other conclusion,\" Stephens said. \n \n On Friday, police released audio recordings, hours of video surveillance footage and a series of graphic photos showing Jenkins' body on the floor inside the freezer. \n \n An attorney for Jenkins' family said the photos were disturbing and raised more question about what happened that night, CNN affiliate WBBM-TV reported \n \n She was alone \n \n Jenkins' death sparked accusations on social media of foul play. Stephens said Friday that \"none were supported by facts.\" \n \n \"The death of any child is tragic; but the death and circumstances surrounding Ms. Jenkins are especially sad,\" the police chief said. \n \n Surveillance video from inside the Crowne Plaza, released by the Rosemont Public Safety Department, showed Jenkins staggering through the hotel's hallways before she disappeared. \n \n In the footage, Jenkins is first seen walking through the hotel with several unidentified people around 1:13 a.m. on September 9. She appears to be steady. \n \n But when Jenkins is next sighted exiting an elevator at 3:25 a.m., she is alone and visibly impaired, and staggers out of the elevator, briefly leaning on the wall for support before heading down the hallway. \n \n The footage showed Jenkins entering a kitchen at approximately 3:32 a.m. but does not show her entering the cooler and freezer, where she was found nearly 24 hours later, because no cameras show the doors directly. \n \n Police don't believe anyone else came in contact with Jenkins after she entered the kitchen. There is only one entrance into the kitchen and anyone who would have walked toward the freezer would have activated a surveillance camera there, Stephens said. \n \n Since Jenkins entered the kitchen until her body was discovered only a security guard was seen entering the area. \n \n \"He did not get close to the freezer and was never out of sight of the camera,\" Stephens said. \n \n No drugs, signs of trauma \n \n The Cook County Medical Examiner's office had recently classified Jenkins' death as accidental. \n \n Her cause of death was hypothermia, the coroner said. \n \n The medical examiner explained that levels of alcohol higher than the driving limit and topiramate, a drug most commonly used to treat epilepsy and migraines, were also contributing factors. \n \n \"When combined, the effect of either or both drugs is enhanced. Topiramate, like alcohol, can cause dizziness, impaired memory, impaired concentration, poor coordination, confusion and impaired judgment. Central nervous system depression, or impairment, combined with cold exposure can hasten the onset of hypothermia and death,\" the office said in a released. \n \n No external or internal trauma as well as \"hundreds of drugs of abuse, medications and other chemical compounds\" -- along with date-rape drugs -- were found on Jenkins' body, the coroner said. ||||| Rosemont PD: Kenneka Jenkins case closed, teen\u2019s death an accident \n \n The Rosemont Police Department on Friday officially closed the case of Kenneka Jenkins, ruling the 19-year-old\u2019s death was an accident, and posted online a massive trove of reports, video, and even crime scene photos of the teen\u2019s body inside the hotel freezer where it was discovered. \n \n The announcement comes more than a month after the teen\u2019s body was found Sept. 10, inside a freezer in an unused kitchen at the Crown Plaza Hotel, where Jenkins had attended a party with more than 30 other guests. In a four-page press release, Rosemont Police Chief Donald Stephens III acknowledged the speculation swirling around the case, fueled by internet conspiracies and the outrage of Jenkins\u2019 family. \n \n \u201cWhile there were many theories, rumors and much speculation floating around social media regarding the death of Ms. Jenkins, none were supported with facts,\u201d Stephens\u2019 statement read. \u201cWhile all leads and theories were investigated by our department, what we have reported throughout the investigation and again, today, are the facts.\u201d \n \n \u201cAt this time, the Rosemont Public Safety Department has closed the death investigation of Kenneka Jenkins and has classified this incident as an accidental death. There is no evidence that indicates any other conclusion.\u201d \n \n The records were released in response to public records requests. A spokesman for the department did not immediately respond when asked if the records posted on the village website comprised every file from the investigation, but a letter from the village included in the files seems to indicate that only personal information, such as addresses were redacted. \n \n Jenkins\u2019 mother called Rosemont Police early on the morning of Sept. 9 to report Jenkins hadn\u2019t returned home. Friends said Jenkins had left the party, which was attended by more than 30 people and featured heavy drinking and drug use. \n \n Surveillance video from cameras around the hotel show Jenkins staggering through hallways and into the kitchen area, though the motion-activated camera in the kitchen does not show her entering the freezer. On police dispatch tapes, an officer who first went into the cooler after a hotel worker found the body the next day said Jenkins was \u201cfrozen solid.\u201d \n \n Police have downplayed conjecture about foul play from the start, and the Cook County Medical Examiner has ruled the death an accident, and that Jenkins died of hypothermia. Blood tests showed Jenkins had alcohol and a drug used to treat epilepsy in her system. Stephens\u2019 statement says the department still is investigating a man and woman who used a stolen credit card to book the hotel room, and have identified all but six party guests. \n \n After meeting with police officials earlier this week, lawyer for Jenkins\u2019 family complained bitterly about the release of the information. Police had refused to release the full case file to the family, and showed relatives only a handful of photos that were of a \u201cpersonal, private and indecent\u201d nature, attorney Larry Rogers Jr., said. Police said they would release additional records to public on Friday. \n \n \u201cFrankly, [the] photos depicting how [Jenkins] was found raise more questions about what happened to [her] than they answer,\u201d attorney Larry Rogers Jr. said a statement. \u201cThe pictures are graphic and disturbing images and inexplicably show portions of [her] body exposed.\u201d \n \n It was unclear whether files released Friday will end the theorizing by amateur sleuths. Not long after Rogers issued his statement, social media posts emerged questioning why a woman who was freezing to death would have removed her own clothes. \n \n Investigators seemed to anticipate that litigation, and conspiracy theories, might surround the case for some time. Among the investigative files released Friday was a three-dimensional, digital image of the kitchen where Jenkins\u2019 body was found. The high-tech image of the kitchen layout, the chief explained, would provide accurate measurements of the room and \u201cin the event this kitchen is ever remodeled or changed, the location of items and the layout will be documented.\u201d",

Hide Caption 11 of 11 \n \n Tamerlan died early Friday after a night of ferocious gun battles. The world watched live on television Friday night as police laid siege to Watertown, Massachusetts, and finally captured Dzhokar. \n \n It was unclear what might have motivated the brothers to commit the heinous crime they are suspected of carrying out. All day Friday, reporters sought out people who knew them, trying to understand one thing: Why? \n \n What unfolded was a story typical of the American immigrant narrative: A family originally from the Russian republic of Chechnya fled the brutal wars in their homeland in the 1990s. They moved to neighboring Russian republics before at last arriving in the United States. \n \n The youngest, Dzhokar, came first with his parents, according to his aunt, Maret Tsarnaev. The older son, Tamerlan, was initially left behind with his two sisters. \n \n Eventually, they were reunited -- a family of six whose American journey contained elements of a struggle to fit in and success in making a new life. \n \n Hints of unhappiness \n \n Another familiar narrative also emerged Friday: a high-profile crime followed by a crusade to find out who did it. First, there were photographs, then names attached to the images. And shock. \n \n Friends and acquaintances of the Tsarnaev brothers expressed disbelief. The two men were nice, friendly. Quiet. The kind of guys you'd never even notice or look at twice if you passed them on the street. \n \n Their aunt spoke with Canada's CTV and described the boys' childhood as perfect. Their father, Anzor, was a loving, soft-hearted man. She said he and his wife, Zubeidat, have moved back to Dagestan, which borders Chechnya. \n \n Dzhokar came to America on July 1, 2002, as a tourist and asked for asylum, a federal official told CNN. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen on September 11 last year. \n \n There was some dispute over when his older brother arrived. The U.S. official said he came four years later on September 6, 2006, and held a permanent resident visa. But another federal official said Tamerlan first entered the United States on July 19, 2003. \n \n Alyssa Lindley Kilzer said she often visited the apartment at 410 Norfolk St. in Cambridge, where the Tsarnaevs lived. Kilzer used to get facials from Zubeidat at a local spa but, after she was fired, Kilzer began going to her house. \n \n She wrote about her experience on her Tumblr blog and said the staircase was crowded with shoes and the house was filled with the noise of arguments, cooking and other household chores. It was hardly spa-like but Kilzer thought Zubeidat gave great facials. \n \n Photos: Boston bombings suspect: Tamerlan Tsarnaev Photos: Boston bombings suspect: Tamerlan Tsarnaev Tamerlan Tsarnaev, one of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects, was the subject of an April 2009 photo essay that appeared in a graduate school magazine at Boston University.

My son knows all about it. You can read it on the Internet.\" \n \n Kilzer said she met Tamerlan only once -- he wasn't friendly, she thought. \n \n He was a dapper dresser and drove a Mercedes, according to an online photo gallery titled \"Will Box for Passport.\" \n \n \"I'm dressed European style,\" Tamarlan said in a caption accompanying a photo of white leather shoes. \n \n Photographer Johannes Hirn shot images of Tamerlan at the Wai Kru Mixed Martial Arts Center on Brighton Street in Cambridge. That's where he trained before the Golden Gloves. \n \n He was a good boxer, said Gene McCarthy from the Sommerville Boxing Club, who'd coached Tamerlan since he was 16. \n \n He was more than 6-feet tall, with long arms and determination written all over him. Once, he fought in a New England championship match even though he had the flu and fever blisters covered his lips. He won. \n \n Tamerlan had been boxing since he was a kid -- his father began training him while they were still living in the Caucasus region. \n \n His younger brother started coming to the gym from the time he was 10, McCarthy said. Dzhokar followed Tamerlan around like a puppy. He'd be just behind him, doing calisthenics. \n \n Tamerlan told Hirn, the photographer, that he gave up drinking alcohol and smoking in accordance with Muslim values. His aunt said he had become more devout a few years ago and started praying five times a day. \n \n His mother told Russian TV channel RT that her oldest son embraced Islam but never spoke of anything extreme; never said he was on the side of jihad. Her son, she said, would never keep secrets from her. She would've known had he been involved in unsavory activities. \n \n However, she said the FBI was checking on him, following his moves on the Internet. \n \n \"How could this happen? They were controlling every step of him, now they are saying this is a terrorist act,\" she said Friday. \n \n FBI agents interviewed Tamerlan two years ago and looked at his travel history, checked databases and searched Web postings, but found no connection with terrorist groups, an FBI official told CNN. \n \n Tamerlan traveled to Sheremetyevo, Russia, in January 2012, according to travel records provided by a U.S. official. He returned six months later, those documents show. \n \n A YouTube page in his name had links to Islamic websites, videos from a radical Australian preacher and rap music. \n \n He had quit college, gotten married and had a daughter two years ago, said his aunt and father. \n \n In an interview Friday with the Russian national TV network Zvezda in Dagestan, Anzor Tsarnaev said his sons had been framed. He said he had been trying to call Dzhokar but his phone is switched off. He'd spoken with Tamerlan the day before. He wanted to make sure Tamerlan was taking care of his brother; that he was studying hard. \n \n This was Anzor's belief: that if his sons did not get an education, they would be left to toiling their entire lives. \n \n But there were hints that all did not sit well for Tamerlan in his new country. \n \n He said this during the photo shoot with Hirn: \"I don't have a single American friend. I don't understand them.\" \n \n And in 2009, Tamerlan, then 22, was arrested for domestic assault and battery after allegedly assaulting his girlfriend, according to Cambridge Police records cited by the website spotcrime.com. \n \n 'I cried ... when they named him' \n \n Dzhokar's friends included Torrie Martinez, 20. \n \n Friday, Martinez stood on Cambridge Street looking down Norfolk Street, where the Tsarnaev brothers made their home. Martinez used to catch the city bus with Dzhokar every day to school and was on the wrestling team with him. \n \n \"I wish I could say he was a bad kid,\" said Martinez, still trying to absorb the news. \"But he was a nice kid from what I knew of him. I talked with him on a daily basis. I practiced with him.\" \n \n He was a sophomore when he met Dzhokar, who was a year behind him. They talked about stuff high school boys talk about; it never got too personal. Martinez didn't know Dzhokar was Chechen. \n \n And they talked wrestling. \"He was a smaller kid, but he did well for his weight class,\" Martinez said. \n \n A smile appears beneath his scruffy, unshaven face. \n \n \"Between me and him, I would pin him.\" \n \n Now he wished he'd whupped him a little harder. The smile vanishes from Martinez's face. \n \n \"I cried ... when they named him.\" \n \n It will be hard to trust anyone again. \n \n Larry Aaronson, a former teacher at Cambridge Rindge and Latin, said he had taken pictures of Dzhokar wrestling. \n \n \"There is nothing in his character, in his deportment, in his demeanor that would suggest anything remotely capable of any of these things that he is now suspected of doing,\" Aaronson said. \n \n \"He was so grateful to be here, he was so grateful to be at the school,\" he said. \"He was compassionate, he was caring, he was jovial.\" \n \n He described Dzhokar, whom he saw in the neighborhood nestled between Harvard and MIT a few weeks ago, as \"a lovely, lovely kid.\" \n \n Construction worker Joey Barbaso, 50, has lived in the neighborhood since he was 5. His pants are worn from hard work and stained from years of paint. That's the kind of people who live here -- along with college students. \n \n \"It's just, I dunno,\" he said. \"You never know who you're living next to.\" \n \n Robin Young, host of radio's \"Here and Now,\" said Dzhokar was her nephew's best friend. She called him a beautiful boy. \n \n But now he was a man despised by many. \n \n Tweeting even after the bombings \n \n Dzhokar had been more public about his life than his brother. More people have stepped forward with accounts of their relationships with him than about Tamerlan. \n \n Dzhokar had a page on the Russian equivalent of Facebook on which he described his worldview as Islam. \n \n Active on Twitter. \"Ain't no love in the heart of the city. Stay safe people,\" he tweeted just hours after the bombings. \n \n Tuesday, he called \"fake\" a story about a woman who died in Monday's bombings and was found by her boyfriend who was planning to propose. \n \n His friend, Giovanni, who wanted only his first name used, said Dzhokar was even joking on Twitter about \"how he had like a dream about eating a cheeseburger and then he was like, 'And the next day, what did I have next?' \n \n \"And I responded (on Twitter) in a joking way, 'A hot dog?' \n \n \"And here I am, like, having a conversation with this guy not knowing what he was doing or what he did.\" \n \n Giovanni said he played video games with Dzhokar, but hadn't seen him in person since January. He said his friend had told him he was engaged to be married, even showing him a photo of his supposed fianc\u00e9e on his phone. \n \n \"He was always just quiet, quiet in a nice (way),\" Giovanni said. \"You just wouldn't suspect that he'd do something so messed up.\" \n \n And he said Dzhokar was particular about his identity. \n \n \"He used to tell us he's the only Chechen ... we'd ever come across,\" Giovanni said. \"Sometimes they'd call him Russian and he'd always correct me.\" \n \n He said he didn't know much about Tamerlan; only that Dzhokar had said his older brother was a boxer. \n \n \"A year ago when I met him ... to think. I had no idea I'd be friending such a messed up person. You just think, 'Oh, he seems nice, he seems innocent.'\" \n \n Dzhokar worked for a time as a lifeguard at a pool at Harvard University, said George McMasters, who hired him about 2\u00bd years ago. \n \n McMasters was impressed with Dzhokar's work ethic. \n \n \"He showed up on time, he watched the water, he rotated from position to position fine, got along well with others.\" \n \n \"He seemed like a very quiet, unassuming young man,\" McMasters said. \"It is very surprising and shocking to see the destruction that he has brought to the city.\" \n \n Last year, McMasters was deployed to Afghanistan with the Army National Guard and, when he returned to the pool job in August, Dhzokar was no longer on the staff or the schedule, he said. \n \n 'Losers' \n \n Not everyone had good things to say. The harshest comments Friday came from the brothers' uncle. \n \n Ruslan Tsarni told reporters outside his home in Montgomery County, Maryland, that he had not seen the Tsarnaev family since December 2005 and last spoke with them in 2009. \n \n Asked what might have motivated the people who did the attack, he said: \"Being losers; hatred to those who were able to settle themselves. These are the only reasons I can imagine.\" \n \n Though the family is Muslim, their religion played no role in the attacks, the uncle insisted. \n \n \"Anything else to do with religion, with Islam, it's a fraud, it's a fake,\" he said. \n \n He described the family as peace-loving, ethnic Chechens. \n \n \"Somebody radicalized them, but it's not my brother, who just moved back to Russia, who spent his life bringing bread to their table, fixing cars,\" he said. \"My family had nothing to do with that family. Of course, we're ashamed, yes, we're ashamed they're children of my brother.\" \n \n Tsarni said he noticed changes in the religious views of Tamerlan Tsarnaev as far back as 2009. He recalled a 2009 phone conversation where in response to some life advice he had given, Tsarnaev called him an \"infidel.\" The young man also told his uncle he was not concerned about work or studies because God had a plan for him. \n \n The Brothers Tsarnaev, said Tsarni, had brought shame on the Chechen people. ||||| A New York Police officer stands guard at the corner of the New York Stock Exchange in New York April 19, 2013, as part of heightened security in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing. \n \n WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI interviewed suspected Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev in early 2011, it said in a statement late Friday, following a tip from a foreign government that he was \"a follower of radical Islam\" and was preparing to leave the United States to join underground organizations. \n \n The FBI said its interview two years ago of Tsarnaev and his family, along with checks of travel records, Internet activity and personal associations, \"did not find any terrorism activity\" at the time. \n \n But the revelation is the first evidence that the Tsarnaev family came to U.S. security officials' attention after they emigrated to the United States about a decade ago, and it could raise questions about whether the government missed potential warning signs about the behavior of two brothers. \n \n Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died overnight in Boston in a shootout with police. His younger brother, Dzhokhar, 19, was taken into custody on Friday evening in the Boston suburb of Watertown after a dramatic, day-long manhunt, Boston police said. \n \n The FBI statement did not disclose which foreign government asked it for information about the brothers and their family. But Tamerlan was widely reported to have made a trip to Russia last year. \n \n The brothers and their family were ethnic Chechens, whose small republic's attempts at independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union were brutally crushed by Moscow. Both brothers, however, were born in the Central Asian state of Kyrgyzstan, the FBI statement said, and Dzhokhar was a naturalized U.S. citizen. \n \n The revelation that the elder Tsarnaev was on U.S. law enforcement authorities' radar screens seemed likely to raise uncomfortable questions for the Obama administration about whether it could have done anything to detect and stop the plot. \n \n \"It's new information to me and it's very disturbing that he's on the FBI radar screen,\" Rep. Michael McCaul, Texas Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said on CNN late Friday. \n \n It is not known when the Boston Marathon bombings were planned, or whether there were clues that could have allowed authorities to pre-empt it. \n \n National security and law enforcement authorities said on earlier Friday that they had not turned up any evidence that the Tsarnaevs had contacts with al Qaeda or other militants overseas. \n \n Rep. Peter King, New York Republican and member of the House intelligence committee, said in a statement that there \"was no federal intelligence or chatter prior to the marathon bombings,\" a reference to militant communications often picked up in advance of an impending attack. \n \n The U.S. officials said they were leaning toward the theory that the bombings were motivated by Islamic extremism, although that remained unproven. \n \n WERE THE TSARNAEVS WORKING WITH OTHERS? \n \n Violent plots involving a single individual or small groups who self-radicalize and have minimal dealings with other militants can be extremely difficult to detect in advance, according to U.S. counterterrorism officials and private experts. \n \n The revelation about the FBI contacts with the elder Tsarnaev came as U.S. officials told Reuters that investigators are scouring government data banks to determine if spy and police agencies missed potential clues that might have alerted them to the two brothers. \n \n Another top priority for investigators is to determine whether the brothers had any confederates either inside the United States or overseas, one U.S. official said. This official and others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation. \n \n Three people were taken into custody for questioning in New Bedford, Massachusetts, police said on Friday. Two men and a woman are being questioned by the FBI \"on the assumption there is an affiliation with\" Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, Lieutenant Robert Richard of the New Bedford Police said. \n \n One official said the possibility that the U.S. government had information that should have raised questions about the Tsarnaev brothers before the attack could not be ruled out. Other officials said they were unaware that such material had turned up. \n \n In several recent cases, U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies failed to put together clues that, in hindsight, might have led them to pre-empt a plot. \n \n In 2009, U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hassan killed 13 people and wounded another 32 at Fort Hood, Texas. Prior to the shooting spree, Hassan had email contacts with Anwar al-Awlaki, the U.S.-born cleric and leader of al Qaida's affiliate in Yemen who was later killed in a U.S. drone strike. \n \n U.S. authorities had investigated Hassan's emails, but concluded they posed no threat of violence. \n \n The father of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the so-called \"underwear bomber\" who tried to bring down a U.S. jetliner over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, reported suspicions about his son's activities to the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria. But Abdulmutallab's U.S. visa was never revoked. \n \n A report by the Senate intelligence committee heavily criticized U.S. intelligence agencies for failing to act on available information in that case. \n \n But Brian Jenkins, a respected terrorism expert at the RAND Corp., dismissed the idea that the Boston bombings represented an intelligence failure. \n \n People will inevitably ask, \"did we miss something in intelligence?\" said Jenkins, speaking before the news of the 2011 FBI interview with Tamerlan Tsarnaev become public. \n \n \"Some people will label it an 'intelligence failure.' But that's because people have come to expect 100 percent security,\" he said. \n \n (Additional reporting by Patrick Temple-West; Editing by Paul Simao and Stacey Joyce)",

    "document": "Getty Images \n \n Any talk of golf as exercise could make cyclists choke on their energy bars. But a new study suggests that a round of golf can confer longevity benefits just as robust as a 100-mile bike ride. \n \n The study in the Christmas edition of BMJ\u2014the peer-reviewed publication formerly known as the British Medical Journal\u2014is based on the mortality records of 9,889 athletes who competed in the Olympic Games between 1896 and 1936. \"Engaging in cycling and rowing (high cardiovascular intensity) had no added survival benefit compared with playing golf or cricket (low cardiovascular intensity).\" \n \n More Marathon Runners Stop Aging Out of the Race \n \n The study adds to a small but growing body of research suggesting that years-long doses of extreme exercise\u2014measured by amount or intensity\u2014may be unproductive, if not counterproductive. In general, the research suggests that the well-established longevity benefits of exercise may cease to accrue or may even diminish beyond a point, for instance, 20 miles a week of running. \n \n \"During high intensive exercise the human body has to deal with all kinds of micro traumata. Over time, this will result in an accumulation of damage, which can be explained as a form of aging,\" said Frouke Engelaer, an author of the study, conducted by a vitality-and-aging department at Leiden University Medical Centre in Leiden, Netherlands. \n \n This research is too preliminary and controversial to trigger warnings against marathons and triathlons. And by all accounts it shouldn't be used as an excuse for staying sedentary, which poses well-established risks of cardiovascular disease. \n \n Apart from health, moreover, extreme fitness can induce euphoria. \"When I was in my peak Ironman triathlon shape, I felt my absolute best,\" said John Gamba, who writes a blog called Golfer Turned Triathlete. \n \n Gamba, 42, doesn't necessarily buy the idea that walking the links is just as good for him as running a half marathon. But his father does. \"My dad just came up to me and said some doctor told him that triathlon and other intensive sports aren't good for you,\" said Gamba. \n \n Write to Kevin Helliker at kevin.helliker@wsj.com \n \n Corrections & Amplifications \n \n The first name of John Gamba was wrongly given as James in an earlier version of this article. ||||| R Zwiers , PhD candidate 1, F W A Zantvoord , medical student 1, F M Engelaer , PhD candidate 12, D van Bodegom , assistant professor of medicine 12, F J G van der Ouderaa , chief scientific officer 1, R G J Westendorp , professor of old age medicine 12 1Leyden Academy on Vitality and Ageing, Rijnsburgerweg 10, 2333 AA Leiden, Netherlands 2Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden Correspondence to: F Engelaer Engelaer{at}leydenacademy.nl Accepted 14 September 2012 \n \n Abstract Objective To assess the mortality risk in subsequent years (adjusted for year of birth, nationality, and sex) of former Olympic athletes from disciplines with different levels of exercise intensity. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Former Olympic athletes. Participants 9889 athletes (with a known age at death) who participated in the Olympic Games between 1896 and 1936, representing 43 types of disciplines with different levels of cardiovascular, static, and dynamic intensity exercise; high or low risk of bodily collision; and different levels of physical contact. Main outcome measure All cause mortality. Results Hazard ratios for mortality among athletes from disciplines with moderate cardiovascular intensity (1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.07) or high cardiovascular intensity (0.98, 0.92 to 1.04) were similar to those in athletes from disciplines with low cardiovascular intensity. The underlying static and dynamic components in exercise intensity showed similar non-significant results. Increased mortality was seen among athletes from disciplines with a high risk of bodily collision (hazard ratio 1.11, 1.06 to 1.15) and with high levels of physical contact (1.16, 1.11 to 1.22). In a multivariate analysis, the effect of high cardiovascular intensity remained similar (hazard ratio 1.05, 0.89 to 1.25); the increased mortality associated with high physical contact persisted (hazard ratio 1.13, 1.06 to 1.21), but that for bodily collision became non-significant (1.03, 0.98 to 1.09) as a consequence of its close relation with physical contact. Conclusions Among former Olympic athletes, engagement in disciplines with high intensity exercise did not bring a survival benefit compared with disciplines with low intensity exercise. Those who engaged in disciplines with high levels of physical contact had higher mortality than other Olympians later in life. \n \n Introduction Public health associations recommend physical exercise because it is associated with lower mortality risks, better mood and cognition, and lower prevalence of cardiovascular disease.1 2 3 4 5 6 7 However, when Pheidippides ran from Marathon to Athens in 490 BC to announce the Greek victory over the Persians, he died on arrival. As his case illustrates, exercise of high intensity can also place great strain on the body and can cause serious injuries and damage.8 The question is whether regular high intensity exercise is associated with a lower or higher mortality risk. When the first modern Olympic Games were held in Athens in 1896, including a marathon run to Athens, the organisers decided to shorten the distance, with the death of Pheidippides in mind. The current distance of 42.195 km was determined only later during the third Olympics in London, when the royal family requested the race to be from the start at Windsor Castle to the royal stage in the White City Stadium. This year, the Olympic Games were back in London, but whether high intensity exercise is beneficial for reducing mortality risk is still debated.9 10 The effect of high intensity exercise on mortality later in life has mostly been studied among professional athletes, using the general population as a control group. The outcomes from these studies differ; some did not find a survival benefit, whereas others showed lower mortality in athletes than in their non-athletic counterparts from the general population.11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 The lower mortality risk of professional athletes compared with the general population could be due to specific social and psychometric characteristics, and whether high intensity exercise brings a survival benefit or an increased mortality risk for athletes remains to be elucidated. We analysed mortality patterns in a large historic cohort of athletes who had all participated in the Olympic Games between 1896 and 1936 but performed at different levels of cardiovascular, static, and dynamic intensity exercise. \n \n Methods Study population In May 2011 we retrieved a cohort of 21 127 former Olympic athletes from the continuously updated Sports Reference database, the largest online database of Olympic athletes.25 Figure 1\u21d3 summarises the inclusion process. We included 9889 former Olympic athletes, born between 1830 and 1910, with a known age at death, who participated in at least one of the Summer Olympic Games between 1896 and 1936. We excluded 2162 athletes from nine disciplines that were not mentioned in the classification of the American College of Cardiology.26 We classified skeleton as bobsledding and polo as equestrian, because of the very similar types of exercise. For 7534 athletes, the age at death was unknown owing to an unknown date of birth, date of death, or both. Finally, we excluded 1542 participants born after 1910, as they could possibly be still alive. Fig 1 Flow diagram showing inclusion of former Olympic athletes in study Classification of Olympic disciplines We classified the 43 Olympic disciplines according to the classification system of the 8th Task Force on the Classification of Sports by the American College of Cardiology.26 The classification of cardiovascular intensity sums a static component reflecting maximal voluntary muscle contraction and a dynamic component reflecting maximal oxygen uptake; both were categorised at three levels of intensity\u2014low, moderate, and high. The system also defines three levels of static and dynamic intensity\u2014low, moderate, and high. When an athlete had participated in multiple disciplines, we categorised him/her in the discipline with the highest cardiovascular score. The risk of bodily collision was also classified by the American College of Cardiology.26 Finally, we classified the various disciplines as low (non-contact), moderate (limited contact), and high (full contact), according to the classification of contact sports of the American Academy of Pediatrics.27 The levels of exercise intensity were similar in athletes who were included in and excluded from this analysis (data not shown). Statistical analysis We calculated hazard ratios for all cause mortality by using a left truncated Cox proportional hazards model, entering participants at the age of first participation in the Olympic Games. All analyses were adjusted for sex, year of birth, and nationality. We used Stata 11 for all calculations. \n \n Results We included 9889 athletes from 43 different Olympic disciplines that were classified in various categories of intensity of exercise, risk of bodily collision, and the level of physical contact. The supplementary table summarises the characteristics of these 43 disciplines. Figure 2\u21d3 shows all 43 disciplines stratified for the level of static, dynamic, and cardiovascular intensity, classified according the American College of Cardiology.26 Fig 2 43 Olympic disciplines classified in categories of static and dynamic intensity, as well as three categories of low, moderate, and high cardiovascular intensity (from yellow to red).26 We firstly calculated hazard ratios for mortality dependent on different levels of exercise intensity. As the participants came from different birth cohorts, we adjusted all our analyses for year of birth, which, as expected, was correlated with mortality. Next, we adjusted for sex and nationality, which were also correlated with mortality (data not shown). Table 1\u21d3 shows hazard ratios for mortality for different levels of cardiovascular, static, and dynamic intensity in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Engagement in disciplines with increasing cardiovascular intensity was not associated with a significantly higher mortality risk; the hazard ratio for moderate intensity was 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.96 to 1.07; P=0.71), and that for high intensity was 0.98 (0.92 to 1.40; P=0.46). Multivariate analysis showed similar results (table 1\u21d3). Analysis of the static and dynamic components separately showed similar non-significant results. Univariate analysis showed a small beneficial effect of moderate static exercise, but this was not reflected in a lower hazard ratio in athletes engaged in disciplines with high intensity static exercise. Table 1 Hazard ratios of mortality for athletes in disciplines with different intensities of exercise View this table: We also studied the effect of bodily collision and physical contact on mortality (table 2\u21d3). Athletes engaged in disciplines with a high risk of bodily collision had an 11% higher mortality risk compared with those who were not exposed (hazard ratio 1.11, 1.06 to 1.15; P<0.001). When comparing athletes who had performed in disciplines with various levels of physical contact, we found that those who participated in sports with only moderate contact did not have a higher mortality risk. However, athletes who were exposed to high levels of physical contact had a 16% higher mortality risk compared with those with low physical contact (hazard ratio 1.16, 1.11 to 1.22; P<0.001). These higher mortality risks remained similar in the multivariate analysis, whereas the hazard ratio for bodily collision became non-significant. Table 2 Hazard ratios of mortality for athletes in disciplines with different risk of bodily collision and physical contact View this table: We additionally did similar analyses in various subgroups\u2014men only, deaths after age 50, born before 1900, and born after 1900 (fig 3\u21d3). In none of the subgroups was exercise at high cardiovascular intensity associated with a reduction in mortality risk. However, we found a significant higher mortality risk in all these subgroups for risk of bodily collision and high physical contact. Fig 3 Hazard ratios of mortality (95% CIs) in former Olympic athletes according to cardiovascular intensity, bodily collision, and physical contact. Analyses were adjusted for sex, year of birth, and nationality \n \n Discussion Our results show that former Olympic athletes who engaged in disciplines with high cardiovascular intensity had similar mortality risks to athletes from disciplines with low cardiovascular intensity. This would indicate that engaging in cycling and rowing (high cardiovascular intensity) had no added survival benefit compared with playing golf or cricket (low cardiovascular intensity). Although comparing modern sporting activity with that during the first series of the games is a daunting task, this analysis is sobering for all those athletes who trained so hard to qualify for the London Olympics in 2012. Moreover, our analyses point to a potential risk for those engaged in disciplines with a high risk of bodily collision or high levels of physical contact. As the higher mortality risk persisted for death after age 50, this increased risk could not be explained by the death of young athletes due to trauma. We consider it more likely that the higher mortality risk reflects the effect of a gradual accumulation of multiple bodily injuries during sporting activities. Previous studies have shown that bodily collisions or fierce physical contacts are responsible for a large proportion of the total burden of injuries.8 28 These injuries may have longlasting detrimental effects, in line with the generalised theory of ageing. For instance, repetitive blows to the head, especially in boxers, are associated with cognitive impairment, early onset dementia, and reduced life expectancy.29 30 Our findings stand in contrast to several other studies showing a benefit to late life mortality risk in very well trained athletes.31 32 33 34 A possible explanation could be that these studies included only exercise of moderate intensity. Other studies, however, described a late life survival advantage for endurance athletes who had trained at high physical intensity.22 23 24 35 All previous observations may be subject to bias, however, as trained athletes differ from the general population in more ways than just physical fitness. We consider our comparison of former Olympic athletes who performed their sports at different physical intensity to be more robust than a comparison between trained athletes and people from the population at large. This interpretation is strengthened by the fact that outcomes were congruent in all domains of physical intensity (for example, cardiovascular, static and dynamic intensity). In this study, we used data from athletes who participated in the Olympic Games between 1896 and 1936, so outcomes reflect late life consequences of intensive exercise programmes that were in vogue 70 to 110 years ago. Since then, training programmes, especially on a (semi)professional level, have changed substantially. Top athletes now not only train more often and more intensely, but training has also become more individualised and specifically focused. Moreover, medical care to prevent permanent damage is undoubtedly better and could explain why in the past the potential benefits of intensive physical training were overwhelmed by trade-offs later in life. We do not have access to any data that allow for a valid comparison of use of anabolic steroids and other stimulating substances, but many people would argue that their use was probably less prevalent in the past than it is now. For all of these reasons, care is needed in extrapolating our findings to the late life effects of current training schemes. Regarding the negative effect of bodily collision and fierce physical contact, current sporting activities are much more extreme with regard to velocity, g force, and other mechanical strains. Collisions and physical injuries could therefore have more effect nowadays, despite better protective aids and medical treatment. Our findings could well underestimate the late life effects of the gradual accumulation of permanent damage due to repeated collisions and injuries to which top athletes are exposed. This being said, several potential confounders could decrease or further increase the hazard ratios for mortality that we have found. These include unknown factors such as the total number of years spent in training, age at which intensive training ceased, intensity of exercise after athletes withdrew from competitive sports, specific behaviour in specific types of sport, and specific personal characteristics depending on the type of sport. The beneficial effects of exercise could also be counterbalanced by detrimental effects of (acute) cessation of physical exercise resulting in a net neutral effect. Although we did not find evidence that former Olympic athletes from disciplines involving high intensity exercise have a higher mortality risk than other former Olympians, people should think for a moment before engaging in disciplines with risk of bodily collision or fierce physical contact. This notion may help to explain a historical fact. Before Pheidippides exclaimed \u201c\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u201d (we have won) and collapsed, he had not only run from Marathon to Athens but had fought in the battle of Marathon before that. It is tempting to speculate that it was not the run from Marathon to Athens but the effect of armed force that led to his tragic death.

In fact, a new study finds that heavy cardio sports like cycling and rowing do nothing to help you live longer than playing golf or cricket, reports the Wall Street Journal. Researchers looked at mortality rates in 9,889 Olympic athletes who completed from 1896 to 1936 in 43 types of sports, and surprisingly found that those who competed in intense activities did not live any longer than those who curled, shot guns, played cricket, or golfed. \"Engaging in cycling and rowing (high cardiovascular intensity) had no added survival benefit compared with playing golf or cricket (low cardiovascular intensity),\" says the study.

Whatever you want, just keep me tapped into that sweet lip action... oh, Lordy, I haven't felt a man's touch since 20/20.\" *FAINT* \n \n Mediaite hints that the smooch worked: Obama and Diane Sawyer sitting in a tree, conducting an unremarkable interview that will air between car insurance ads to overmedicated seniors\u2014I-N-G. \n \n But were you aware that our president has frequently deployed his lips to win over potential adversaries and reward friends alike?

(NY Post: You've got my number. -ED) \n \n As our national love affair with Obama continues to sours, seems he's about one bad Gallup poll from resorting to \"7 Minutes In Heaven\" with every single American. \n \n [Lukas Ketner drew the picture for Willamette Week.] ||||| Did President Obama dodge a friendly kiss from French First Lady Carla Bruni? \n \n Segrette/AP France's first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy shakes President Obama's hand instead of a customary kiss, like the one exchanged between Michelle Obama and French President Nicolas Sarkozy. \n \n Forget NATO, world peace or the global recession - it was The Kiss, or the lack of one, that was the talk of Europe Friday. \n \n The international kiss-ident unfolded as President Obama and his wife, Michelle, met French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his supermodel wife, Carla Bruni, in Strasbourg, France, as part of this weekend's NATO summit. \n \n Everything seemed to be going swimmingly, in a French kind of way, outside the regal Palais Rohan. \n \n Michelle and Carla shared a warm embrace and a Continental-style peck on each cheek, captured by hundreds of whirring paparazzi. \n \n President Obama and the prime minister shook hands heartily and even two-stepped through an awkward French man-hug. \n \n The much smaller Sarkozy even managed to land a double-kiss on Michelle - pausing only to glide his hand across his wife's celebrated derriere with a giddy, look-what-I-got grin plastered on his face, dutifully caught on camera. \n \n But when Bruni leaned in to kiss President Obama, something happened. \n \n Maybe he balked, perhaps imagining all the late-night fodder a picture of him smooching a fashion model might inspire. Maybe she pulled back. Whatever. \n \n There was no kiss, just a prim handshake, sending the British press in particular into a spasm of forensic investigation that included a frame-by-frame analysis of the Kiss That Wasn't. \n \n It would be hours before the situation was rectified - at a dinner last night, when Bruni and Obama finally managed to seal their relationship with a polite double kiss. \n \n Perhaps by then Bruni had gotten the green light from Michelle during a lunch of marinated scallops with caviar they enjoyed inside the palace, after which the ladies resolved to work together to battle AIDS (Bruni lost a brother to the disease). \n \n The day included plenty for fashion mavens to chew on as well. \n \n Michelle Obama, having stuck for most of the week to price-conscious ensembles from J. Crew, broke out the big guns for her first tete-a-tete with Bruni, a.k.a. \"The Chanel Gazelle.\" \n \n Obama wore a brilliant magenta dress with a metallic sheen by Thakoon, a Thai-born designer who grew up in the U.S. The double-hemmed, Italian-silk dress cost about $1,500 - a major price upgrade for the first lady. \n \n Bruni, on the other hand, opted for a cropped-sleeve Dior coat in a soft, plain grey - stylish but very simple. \n \n \"Carla actually looks a bit washed out and (we can't believe we're about to say this) prim and proper,\" said The Guardian of London. \"A flash of color or a fashionable statement accessory could have taken this outfit to another level - but that's just not Carla's style.\"",

    "document": "An announcement bump for Mitt Romney and a bus-tour boost for Sarah Palin put the pair atop the field for the Republican presidential nomination. But while their primary standings are similar, their broader prospects for election look vastly different. \n \n Romney appears formidable: In a general-election trial heat in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll he runs evenly with Barack Obama among all Americans, and numerically outpoints him, 49-46 percent, among registered voters -- not a statistically significant lead, given sampling error, but a clear reflection of Obama's vulnerability to a well-positioned challenger. \n \n Charts and Questionnaire \n \n Romney, though, is the only Republican to run that well; Obama leads all other potential opponents tested in this poll -- Palin, Newt Gingrich, Tim Pawlenty, Michele Bachmann and Jon Huntsman. Palin fares worst, trailing Obama by 17 points among all adults, 15 points among registered voters. \n \n Indeed, despite advancing in GOP primary preference, Palin faces daunting challenges. Sixty-four percent of Americans say they definitely will not vote for her for president, a new high. Sixty-three percent describe her as unqualified for the job, below its peak but still a substantial majority. Even in her own party, among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 41 percent rule out voting for her and 39 percent see her as unqualified. \n \n Overall, 21 percent of leaned Republicans support Romney for the nomination, 17 percent Palin, with all others in single digits. Still, while those two lead, the flipside is that each is not supported by eight in 10 potential GOP voters, indicating plenty of room to move as the field coalesces and voters tune in. Today just 22 percent of Americans (and 24 percent of leaned Republicans) are following the 2012 presidential election very closely. \n \n There is, moreover, a continued lack of enthusiasm for the Republican field. Fewer than half of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 47 percent, describe themselves as satisfied with their choice of candidates for the nomination, barely changed from 43 percent in April despite the official entrances of Romney, Gingrich and Pawlenty; exits of Mike Huckabee, Donald Trump and Mitch Daniels; and revving-up sounds from Palin, Bachmann and Huntsman. That's far lower than the level of satisfaction, 68 percent, in June '07. \n \n FRUSTRATED? -- The risks to Obama are underscored by the ABC News Frustration Index: It stands at 68, essentially what it was going into the 2010 midterm elections. Based on ratings of the economy, presidential approval, anti-incumbency and dissatisfaction with the federal government, it correlates strongly with House re-election rates and presidential prospects alike. \n \n The index peaked at 80 in 2008, when the Democrats regained the White House, and at 73 in summer 1992, shortly before the first President Bush lost re-election; it was 67 last fall, when the GOP regained the House and scored major inroads in the Senate. The Frustration Index today is a relatively mild 50 among Democrats, but a boiling 80 among Republicans -- and close to it, 72, among independents, the quintessential swing voters in national elections. \n \n Tellingly, the Frustration Index is a cool 19 among the few who say the economy's in excellent or good shape, rising to 65 among those who say it's not so good -- and 83 among the more than four in 10 who say the economy is in poor shape. In partisan terms, the index is relatively low (48) among liberal Democrats, but 81 among conservative Republicans; and likewise 48 among Obama supporters in a match-up with Romney, while 85 among Romney supporters. \n \n Among the index's components, and related survey results in this poll, produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates: \n \n A vast 89 percent of Americans say the economy's in bad shape. It's ranged from 87 to 94 percent steadily since spring 2008. This gets old; people want relief. But 57 percent say that in terms of their own experience, the economy has not yet even begun to recover from the recession. And among the minority that says a recovery has begun, 81 percent say it's a weak one. \n \n The president's bin Laden bounce is gone. He had a 47 percent job approval rating in April. That bounced to 56 percent in a Post/Pew poll immediately after Osama bin Laden was killed. It's back, exactly, to 47 percent now. Forty-nine percent disapprove of the president's performance, including 53 percent of independents, and strong disapprovers outnumber strong approvers by 10 points. \n \n More -- 59 percent, a new high -- disapprove of Obama's handling of the economy, which, in a nutshell, is what the public's frustration is all about. Obama also is back to about an even split with the Republicans in Congress in trust to handle the economy -- 42 percent pick him, 45 percent the GOP. This also was essentially tied in December, then moved away from the GOP in January and March; we're now back to an even division on this most fundamental issue. On the deficit Obama fares worse -- 33 percent approval, down six points since April to a career low. \n \n In another expression of the public's discontent, just 34 percent say they're inclined to re-elect their representative in Congress. Fifty-five percent, instead, say they'll look around for someone new, a level of anti-incumbency as high as it was in early October 2010. If it holds, the risk may not be just to Obama, but to any and all officeholders associated with the status quo. \n \n In two equally critical measures, 66 percent say the country's seriously off on the wrong track and 69 percent describe themselves as dissatisfied or even angry with the way the federal government is working. Both are not quite as high as they were just before the last midterms -- but close. And 25 percent are downright angry about the way the government is operating, tying the high in polls since 1992. \n \n ROMNEY/PALIN -- Romney faces his own challenges. There's potential risk from the health care plan he signed into law as governor of Massachusetts in 2006: Leaned Republicans by 2-1, 41 percent to 21 percent, say they oppose that plan; and while a mere 3 percent support it strongly, 25 percent describe themselves as strong opponents. \n \n So far it's not hurting Romney significantly; even among those who oppose the law, 20 percent support him for the nomination, and in a match-up with Obama, 88 percent in this group take Romney. At the same time a substantial 37 percent of leaned Republicans haven't formed an opinion of the law yet; where they wind up may matter. \n \n Religion may be another question. Romney, a Mormon, has 15 percent support for the nomination from born-again and evangelical white Protestants, a core GOP group, vs. 23 percent from non-evangelicals. Evangelicals accounted for 44 percent of Republican primary voters in 2008, and Romney won 20 percent of their votes, vs. 28 percent from non-evangelicals. \n \n Palin, for her part, does slightly better with white evangelical Republicans than with non-evangelicals, 23 percent vs. 15 percent. But Romney edges Palin among conservative potential GOP voters, and runs evenly with her among supporters of the Tea Party political movement. \n \n Romney is strongest within his party among those earning more than $100,000 a year -- with 30 percent support vs. Palin's 9 percent -- and those with college degrees, 28-10 percent. Palin comes back among those less well-off, leading Romney by 25 percent to 11 percent among people with incomes less than $50,000. They're more closely matched in the middle-income group and among non-graduates. \n \n OBAMA/ROMNEY -- With Romney matched against Obama, most Republicans and conservative groups rally. Romney hauls in 87 percent of Republicans, 71 percent of conservatives and evangelical white Protestants alike, and two-thirds of \"very conservative\" Americans. No candidate does better against Obama among any of these groups. \n \n Romney gains 72 percent support from the 46 percent of Americans who describe themselves as supporters of the Tea Party political movement. But, showing breadth, he also draws in 48 percent of independents, the key swing voters. \n \n Romney currently fares better against Obama than John McCain did in 2008 among several important groups, and some surprising ones. Romney and Obama run evenly among women, a group Obama won by 13 points in 2008; among white women, while McCain won by 7 points, Romney leads by 18. McCain won white Catholics, an important swing-voting group, by 5 points, while Romney leads here by 19. \n \n Romney runs about evenly with Obama in the Midwest, a region Obama won by 10 points in 2008. While 18-29-year-olds still overwhelmingly favor Obama regardless of the Republican candidate, his margin against Romney is 23 points, vs. 34 points against McCain. Even among liberals, Obama's edge is down -- 79 points vs. McCain, 61 vs. Romney. \n \n CONSIDER? -- As suggested above, Romney's position far from shuts down other potential GOP runners. Majorities of leaned Republicans say they'd consider each of a dozen potential candidates tested, or at least haven't decided yet. Those garnering the most flat objections include Palin -- 38 percent say they definitely would not support her for the nomination; Ron Paul, 36 percent; and Newt Gingrich, 34 percent. Still, just 18 percent, by contrast, say there's no way they'd consider Romney. \n \n OBAMA'S BASE -- Obama, while down, is hardly out. Against Romney he retains support from 86 percent of Democrats and 79 percent of liberals, and majorities (regardless of his opposition) among non-whites, 18-to29-year-olds, moderates, East and West coast residents, college graduates, and people with incomes less than $50,000 a year. He gets more than two-thirds of the vote from those who are satisfied with the way the government is working and those who think the economy has begun to recover -- but these ranks are thin. \n \n Marking his teeter-totter position, Obama gets precisely split decisions, 49-49 percent, on two personal attributes, understanding the problems of \"people like you\" and sharing \"your values.\" He does better, though, on one other -- 55 percent rate him a strong leader. \n \n But it's the economy that drives Obama's fortunes. Among the nearly six in 10 Americans who think economic recovery has not yet begun, 69 percent disapprove of the president's job performance overall and 64 percent say they won't even consider voting for him in 2012. Romney leads him in this group by 63-29 percent. \n \n Ultimately, 53 percent overall say they'd at least consider voting for Obama for re-election next year, vs. 45 percent who flatly rule him out (among registered voters, 47 percent). That leaves just enough room for Obama to gain re-election -- but with precious little margin for error. And if the economy worsens still, it'll be all the more opportunity for his ultimate challenger. \n \n Methodology -- This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone June 2-5, 2011, among a random national sample of 1,002 adults, including landline and cell-phone-only respondents. Results for the full sample have a 3.5-point error margin. Click here for a detailed description of sampling error. This survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y, with sampling, data collection and tabulation by TNS of Horsham, Pa. \n \n ABC News polls can be found at ABCNEWS.com at http://abcnews.com/pollingunit ||||| The public opinion boost President Obama received after the killing of Osama bin Laden has dissipated, and Americans\u2019 disapproval of how he is handling the nation\u2019s economy and the deficit has reached new highs, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. \n \n The survey portrays a broadly pessimistic mood in the country this spring as higher gasoline prices, sliding home values and a disappointing employment picture have raised fresh concerns about the pace of the economic recovery. \n \n By 2 to 1, Americans say the country is pretty seriously on the wrong track, and nine in 10 continue to rate the economy in negative terms. Nearly six in 10 say the economy has not started to recover, regardless of what official statistics may say, and most of those who say it has improved rate the recovery as weak. \n \n New Post-ABC numbers show Obama leading five of six potential Republican presidential rivals tested in the poll. But he is in a dead heat with former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who formally announced his 2012 candidacy last week, making jobs and the economy the central issues in his campaign. \n \n Among all Americans, Obama and Romney are knotted at 47 percent each, and among registered voters, the former governor is numerically ahead, 49 percent to 46 percent. \n \n Overall, about six in 10 of those surveyed give Obama negative marks on the economy and the deficit. Significantly, nearly half strongly disapprove of his performance in these two crucial areas. Nearly two-thirds of political independents disapprove of the president\u2019s handling of the economy, including \u2014 for the first time \u2014 a slim majority who do so strongly. \n \n In another indicator of rapidly shifting views on economic issues, 45 percent trust congressional Republicans over the president when it comes to dealing with the economy, an 11-point improvement for the GOP since March. Still, nearly as many, 42 percent, side with Obama on this issue. \n \n The president has sought to point to progress on the economy, particularly in the automobile industry, and to argue that the policies he put in place at the beginning of his term are working. But the combined effects of weak economic indicators and dissatisfaction among the public are adding to the political pressures on the White House as the president\u2019s advisers look toward what could be a difficult 2012 reelection campaign. \n \n Meanwhile, Romney emerges in the new survey as the strongest current or prospective Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential field. Although he is by no means in a secure spot, on virtually every measure, the former governor appears better positioned than any of his rivals. \n \n In contrast, the poll brings more bad news for former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, whose bus tour along the East Coast last week renewed speculation that she might join the race. \n \n Almost two-thirds of all Americans say they \u201cdefinitely would not\u201d vote for Palin for president. She is predictably unpopular with Democrats and most independents, but the new survey underscores the hurdles she would face if she became a candidate: 42 percent of Republicans say they\u2019ve ruled out supporting her candidacy. \n \n More than six in 10 Americans say they do not consider Palin qualified to serve as president. That is a slightly better rating for the former governor than through most of last year, but is another indication of widespread public doubts about a possible presidential run. \n \n The Post-ABC poll asked Republicans and GOP-leaning independents whom they would vote for if a primary or caucus were held now in their state. Romney topped the list, with 21 percent, followed by Palin at 17 percent. No one else reached double digits, although former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has suddenly shown interest in becoming a candidate, is close, at 8 percent. Without Palin in the race, Romney scores 25 percent, with all others in the single digits. \n \n In another measure of the field, Republicans chose Romney as the only one of a dozen possible candidates they would \u201cstrongly consider\u201d for the party\u2019s nomination as opposed to stating that they definitely would not vote for him. He and Palin scored equal numbers of respondents who said they would strongly consider supporting them, but Palin has more than double the percentage who have ruled her out. \n \n Other candidates fared poorly on this count, including former House speaker Newt Gingrich (Ga.), whose campaign got off to a rocky start; Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.), a libertarian who has a passionate following but many detractors; and former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.), who announced his candidacy on Monday. \n \n The Massachusetts health-care plan enacted under Romney remains a potentially serious problem in the former governor\u2019s bid. By nearly 2 to 1, Republicans oppose the plan, with strong detractors far outnumbering solid supporters. But there is some potential for him to frame the matter: Almost four in 10 Republicans expressed no opinion about the state\u2019s program. \n \n Overall dissatisfaction with the GOP field remains high, with as many respondents saying they are unhappy with their choices as say they are satisfied. At this time four years ago, nearly seven in 10 Republicans said they were satisfied with their field of candidates. \n \n In head-to-head matchups with Obama, Palin trails by 17 percentage points, the worst of the six possible candidates tested. The president leads Gingrich and former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr. by 10 points. He runs 11 points ahead of former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty and 13 points ahead of Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.). \n \n Romney owes his relatively good standing against the president to support from independents. He and Obama garner roughly equal percentages from those in their own parties. But independents split for Romney 50 percent to 43 percent. \n \n The president continues to receive positive marks as a strong leader, but the 55 percent rating marks a low point of his presidency. He gets mixed reviews on empathy and on sharing the same values as respondents. \n \n The telephone poll was conducted June 2-5 among a random national sample of 1,002 adults. The results from the full survey have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. \n \n Polling manager Peyton M. Craighill and polling analyst Scott Clement contributed to this report.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The raid that killed Osama bin Laden bought President Obama barely a month of higher approval ratings, according to the latest Washington Post/ABCNews poll. The president's approval rating, which stood at 47% in April, surged to 57% in May, but has now dropped right back down to 47%, the poll found. Disapproval of how the president is handling the economy and the deficit is at a high, and two-thirds of respondents say the country is on the wrong track. The bad news for Obama isn't good news for Republican contenders, however\u2014unless they're named Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor is in first place for the GOP nomination, with Sarah Palin in second, according to the poll. Romney would be in a dead heat with Obama if the election were held today; Palin would lose by 17 percentage points. Around half of Republicans said they weren't happy with their options for the nomination, compared to less than a third four years ago.",

    "document": "The Bin Laden who got away: Was 'Crown Prince of Terror' the son who escaped U.S. special forces raid? \n \n \n \n By Daily Mail Reporter \n \n \n \n Captured wives tell Pakistani interrogators one of Bin Laden's sons has not been seen since night of raid \n \n President Obama insisted U.S. assault force had to be large enough to fight way out of country if necessary \n \n One of Osama Bin Laden's sons went missing on the night U.S. special forces stormed their squalid hideout and shot the terror mastermind dead, Pakistani security officials have revealed. \n \n \n \n They fear he could be Bin Laden's youngest son, 19-year-old Hamza, who has been dubbed the 'Crown Prince of Terror'. \n \n Three of Bin Laden's wives and several of his children were taken into custody by Pakistani intelligence forces after the raid - but now it appears one of his sons may have evaded capture. \n \n \n \n The revelation came as fascinating new details emerged of the U.S. assault force dispatched to find Osama Bin Laden, including the president's insistence that it had to be large enough to fight off hostile Pakistani soldiers if need be. \n \n \n \n Missing? Osama Bin Laden's youngest son, Hamza, may have escaped during the raid by U.S. forces. He is pictured here aged around 14, in a propaganda video \n \n President Obama's determination to send a large task-force into Pakistan shows he was willing to risk a confrontation with the country, a close ally, if it meant capturing the Al Qaeda mastermind. \n \n News of Hamza's apparent escape emerged during the interrogation of Bin Laden's three wives by Pakistani investigators. \n \n Officials told ABC News the women had revealed one of the terror leader's sons had not been seen since the raid - but the source did not confirm which one. \n \n \n \n Another son, 22-year-old Khalid, was confirmed dead by the U.S. military. He is believed to have been one of the men shown in graphic photos taken in the aftermath of the raid and released to Reuters last week. \n \n Hideout: Osama Bin Laden was sharing his squalid lair with several of his children and three of his wives, including Amal al-Sadah, right, the youngest. She was shot in the leg when she charged at U.S. forces \n \n \n \n Squalid lair: The compound where Osama Bin Laden was shot dead by U.S. Navy SEALs on May 1. It is believed his youngest son may have escaped \n \n Initially, the White House said Hamza was presumed dead, too, although it was not known for certain whether he was inside the compound when U.S. Navy SEALs struck. \n \n SQUALID LAIR: WHO WAS BIN LADEN HIDING WITH IN ABBOTTABAD? \n \n Bin Laden shared the squalid three-storey compound with two other families: \n \n Sheikh Abu Ahmed, known as Arshad Khan \n \n Khan, Bin Laden's trusted courier, lived there with his wife and children, believed to be aged three and four. Khan was killed in the raid, as was a woman believed to be his wife. 'Tariq' \n \n Little is known about this man, but locals believed he was Khan's brother. He also moved his wife and children into the compound, and was shot in the attack. \n \n The Bin Ladens \n \n Bin Laden shared the top two floors with three of his wives and an unknown number of his younger children. Both he and his son Khalid were shot dead by U.S. special forces. \n \n Pakistani officials say they are holding Bin Laden's three widows, and eight or nine children belonging to all three men. \n \n But according to ABC his mother is among the three widows being held by Pakistan intelligence. \n \n \n \n She is thought to be Khairiah Sabar, who married Bin Laden in 1985. \n \n \n \n Bin Laden's youngest wife, Yemeni Amal al-Sadah, was shot in the leg as she charged at U.S. forces when they stormed the compound. \n \n All three women are due to be interrogated by U.S. agents soon, after days of wrangling with Pakistani officials who have been interviewing the widows themselves. \n \n Hamza was widely seen as his father's heir. He had been implicated in the murder of Pakistani leader Benazir Bhutto. \n \n Pakistani investigators agreed it appeared someone was missing from the squalid lair where Bin Laden was shot dead on Sunday. \n \n The terror mastermind shared the hideout with three of his five wives and several of his younger children, including his 12-year-old daughter, Safiyah. \n \n According to Pakistani officials, the girl watched her father die and described how she saw his bloody body being hoisted into a U.S. helicopter. \n \n Pakistani authorities say they are holding eight or nine children who were found there after the U.S. commandos left, some of whom were related to Bin Laden's courier, who was also killed in the raid. \n \n Altogether, Pakistani officials say they captured 17 people left behind in the compound after U.S. forces left. \n \n Young terrorist: Hamza Bin Laden appeared in a 2001 propaganda video when he was aged about ten, reading a jihadist poem at his brother's wedding \n \n They are thought to include the wife of 'Tariq', believed to be the brother of Bin Laden's trusted courier, Sheikh Abu Ahmed. \n \n Bin Laden's youngest son, Hamza, has in the past been dubbed as the Crown Prince of Terror and was widely-tipped to succeed his father. \n \n He has made at least two appearances in Bin Laden's propaganda videos. \n \n \n \n In one, released in 2001 and made at the wedding of his brother Mohammed, Hamza wore combat dress and read a poem dedicated to his father\u2019s exploits. \n \n One passage went: \u2018I\u2019m warning America that its people will face terrible results if they chase my father. Fighting Americans is the basis for faith.\u2019 \n \n Home video: Films found at Osama Bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan show the terror leader obsessively watching videos of himself. He shared the specially-built compound with two other families \n \n In 2005, when he was 15, he featured in a jihadist film shot in a Pakistani tribal area on the Afghan border. \n \n He held a semi-automatic assault rifle and was said to have just taken part in a battle against Pakistani security forces. \n \n His voice also appeared in a video released on the third anniversary of London's 7/7 bombings, calling for the destruction of the U.S., Britain, France and Denmark. \n \n He declared: 'Oh God, reward the fighters. God, be pleased with those who want to go for jihad. Grant victory to the Taliban over the gangs of infidels.' \n \n Hamza was also implicated in the murder of Pakistani leader Benazir Bhutto, who had named him as a leader of one of the Al Qaeda-linked groups of assassins planning to kill her. \n \n \n \n REVEALED: DETAILS OF CRACK TEAM SENT TO FIND OSAMA BIN LADEN \n \n Experts: A team of U.S. Navy SEALs went into the compound while two groups of specialists were on stand-by to deal with Bin Laden, dead or alive Senior military officials today revealed compelling details of the U.S. special forces team sent into Pakistan to find Osama Bin Laden. The entire assault team was big enough to fight its way out of the country if necessary, on President Obama's orders. There were also two teams of specialists on standby, to deal with Bin Laden dead or alive. The first team was ready to bury the terror leader if he was killed, and the second was made up of interrogators, lawyers and translators in case he was captured. They would have met Bin Laden and U.S. SEALs on board a Navy ship, probably the Carl Vinson in the Arabian Sea. \n \n Speaking anonymously, officials told the New York Times the president reviewed plans for the raid about ten days in advance. He urged commanders to make sure they were taking enough troops to fight their way out if hostile Pakistani forces tried to oppose the operation - showing the lack of trust he placed in a close ally. \n \n Originally, two helicopters were supposed to wait just over the border in Afghanistan in case they were needed - 90 minutes away from the compound. After Mr Obama's intervention, commanders decided to send two extra helicopters with more troops. They followed the two Black Hawk helicopters with the assault team on board. One of the back-up craft was used when one of the first was badly damaged as it landed. One senior officials told the Times: 'The president did not want to leave anything to chance. He wanted extra forces if they were necessary.' \n \n \n \n ||||| One of Osama bin Laden's sons may have gone missing in the midst of the Navy SEAL raid that took the life of the al Qaeda leader more than a week ago, Pakistani security officials told ABC News today. \n \n The officials said bin Laden's three wives, who are all in Pakistani custody, said that one of bin Laden's sons has not been seen since the raid. The son was not identified, but Pakistani investigators agreed that it appeared someone was missing from the sprawling compound, the officials said. \n \n Later, however, one U.S. official said there was no evidence anyone was missing from the compound and Senator Dianne Feinstein, chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, told CNN that in a recent briefing with the CIA there was no mention of a missing son. \n \n U.S. officials said that one of bin Laden's sons, Khalid, was killed in the raid. It is not known if another son, Hamza, was in the compound at the time of the raid, though his mother is reportedly one of the wives in custody. The U.S. has previously denied the SEALs took anyone from the compound other than bin Laden's body. \n \n The U.S. initially faced resistance from Pakistani authorities when investigators asked for access to bin Laden's widows, but a U.S. official said Monday Pakistani official promised to make the meeting happen sometime soon. One senior Pakistani security official told ABC News there is still no timeframe for that meeting, however. \n \n READ: Pakistan to Give U.S. Access to Bin Laden Widows, Official Says \n \n Bin Laden, who was married five times, is survived by at least 18 children. None of the sons, however, are in line to succeed their father for leadership of al Qaeda. \n \n \"Unlike a lot of Arab governments that are dynastic,\" said former White House counterterrorism advisor Richard Clarke, now an ABC News consultant, \"al Qaeda has not been and his sons have never played a real operational role of any significance. They did not appear to be groomed for leadership roles in al Qaeda.\" ||||| Pakistani security officials believe a member of the bin Laden household has disappeared since the raid, further deepening the confusion about who was killed. \n \n It is understood that three of bin Laden\u2019s widows, currently in Pakistani custody, have told interrogators that one son has not been seen since the operation. \n \n The fresh details raise fears that the al-Qaeda leader\u2019s youngest son and closest confidant, Hamza, may have escaped capture. \n \n The White House initially claimed that Hamza, 20, had been killed at the house in Abbottabad, about 30 miles from Islamabad. Officials later said his 22-year-old brother Khalid had been killed instead. \n \n On Tuesday night an intelligence source in Islamabad told The Daily Telegraph that shifting accounts of what had happened, coupled with the widows\u2019 testimony, left them unable to account for one person who they believe had been living at the house. \n \n \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it was his son. Someone, one person may have been in the compound that we now cannot account for if - we believe what we are being told,\u201d he said. \n \n Bin Laden, who was married five times, had as many as 24 children. \n \n No-one knows for certain who was in the compound where bin Laden had lived, hidden in plain sight, for five years. \n \n However, Hamza\u2019s mother is believed to be among the family members in Pakistani custody. \n \n Hamza, thought to be the youngest of the Saudi-born warlord's sons, has been described as the \u201ccrown prince of terror\u201d. He featured on an extremist website to mark the third anniversary of the July 7 London bombings in which 52 people died. He read a poem called for \u201cdestruction\u201d of America, Britain, France and Denmark. \n \n Intelligence agencies believe he was being groomed as a possible future leader on al-Qaeda. \n \n He was implicated in the assassination of moderate Pakistani leader Benazir Bhutto in 2007.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 One of Osama bin Laden's sons may have escaped the raid by Navy SEALs, according to ABC News and British papers the Telegraph and Daily Mail. It seems more guesswork than anything at this point, though. Bin Laden's three widows have reportedly told Pakistani authorities that one son has not been seen since the raid. The best guess is that they're referring to bin Laden's youngest son, Hamza, thought to be around 19 or 20 and a close confidante of his father. His mother is one of the detained widows. Initial reports had him killed in the raid, but that might have been confusion over the killing of a different son, Khalid. In any event, Pakistani officials agree that someone appears to be missing. \u201cWe don\u2019t know if it was his son,\" an unidentified source tells the Telegraph. \"Someone, one person may have been in the compound that we now cannot account for if\u2014we believe what we are being told.\"",

    "document": "Abstract \n \n We measured maps of atmospheric water (H 2 O) and its deuterated form (HDO) across the martian globe, showing strong isotopic anomalies and a significant high D/H enrichment indicative of great water loss. The maps sample the evolution of sublimation from the north polar cap, revealing that the released water has a representative D/H value enriched by a factor of about 7 relative to Earth\u2019s ocean (VSMOW). Certain basins and orographic depressions show even higher enrichment, while high altitude regions show much lower values (1 to 3 VSMOW). Our atmospheric maps indicate that water ice in the polar reservoirs is enriched in deuterium to at least 8 VSMOW, which would mean that early Mars (4.5 billion years ago) had a global equivalent water layer at least 137 meters deep. ||||| A massive ancient ocean once covered nearly half of the northern hemisphere of Mars making the planet a more promising place for alien life to have gained a foothold, Nasa scientists say. \n \n The huge body of water spread over a fifth of the planet\u2019s surface, as great a portion as the Atlantic covers the Earth, and was a mile deep in places. In total, the ocean held 20 million cubic kilometres of water, or more than is found in the Arctic Ocean, the researchers found. \n \n \n \n Unveiled by Nasa on Thursday, the compelling evidence for the primitive ocean adds to an emerging picture of Mars as a warm and wet world in its youth, which trickled with streams, winding river deltas, and long-standing lakes, soon after it formed 4.5bn years ago. \n \n \n \n The view of the planet\u2019s ancient history radically re-writes what many scientists believed only a decade ago. Back then, flowing water was widely considered to have been a more erratic presence on Mars, gushing forth only rarely, and never forming long-standing seas and oceans. \n \n \n \n \u201cA major question has been how much water did Mars actually have when it was young and how did it lose that water?\ufffd? said Michael Mumma, a senior scientist at Nasa Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. \n \n \n \n Writing in the journal, Science, the Nasa team, and others at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Munich, provide an answer after studying Mars with three of the most powerful infra-red telescopes in the world. \n \n \n \n The scientists used the Keck II telescope and Nasa\u2019s Infrared Telescope Facility, both in Hawaii, and the ESO\u2019s Very Large Telescope in Chile, to make maps of the Martian atmosphere over six years. They looked specifically at how different forms of water molecules in the Martian air varied from place to place over the changing seasons. \n \n \n \n Martian water, like that on Earth, contains standard water molecules, made from two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom, and another form of water made with a heavy isotope of hydrogen called deuterium. On Mars, water containing normal hydrogen is lost to space over time, but the heavier form is left behind. \n \n When normal water is lost on Mars, the concentration of deuterium in water left behind goes up. The process can be used to infer how much water there used to be on the planet. The higher the concentration of deuterium, the more water has been lost. \n \n Ancient Mars was a warm and wet planet \n \n The infrared maps show that water near the Martian ice caps is enriched with deuterium. The high concentration means that Mars must have lost a vast amount of water in the past, equivalent to more than six times that now locked up in the planet\u2019s frozen ice caps. \n \n \n \n The scientists calculate that the amount of water was enough to create a global ocean that covered the entire surface of Mars to a depth of 137m. But Mars was probably never completely submerged. Based on the Martian terrain today, the scientists believe the water pooled into a much deeper ocean in the low-lying northern plains, creating an ocean that covered nearly a fifth of the planet\u2019s surface. The Atlantic, by comparison, covers about 17% of Earth\u2019s surface. \n \n \n \n \u201cUltimately we can conclude this idea of an ocean covering 20% of the planet which opens the idea of habitability and the evolution of life on the planet,\ufffd? said Geronimo Villanueva, the first author on the study. \n \n Methane on Mars: does it mean the Curiosity rover has found life? Read more \n \n The huge body of water lasted for millions of years. But over time, the Martian atmosphere thinned. The drop in pressure meant more ocean water wafted into space. The planet lost much of its insulation too. No longer warm enough to keep the water liquid, the ocean receded and eventually froze. Today, only 13% of the ocean remains, locked up the Martian polar caps. \n \n \n \n \u201cWe now know Mars was wet for a much longer time than we thought before,\ufffd? said Mumma. Nasa\u2019s Curiosity rover has already shown that Mars had standing water for 1.5 billion years, longer than it took for life to emerge on Earth. \u201cNow we see that Mars must have been wet for a period even longer,\ufffd? Mumma added. \n \n \n \n John Bridges, a planetary scientist at Leicester University, who works on Nasa\u2019s Curiosity rover mission, said Mars was surely at least habitable in the distant past. \u201cTen years ago, the story of water on Mars was an occasional flood of rocky debris every 100m years that then switched off again. We now know it\u2019s more continuous. There were long-standing bodies of water: lakes, deltas and perhaps even seas,\ufffd? he said. \n \n \n \n \u201cIt seems to me that we have excellent evidence that Mars was once habitable, though whether it was ever inhabited is not clear. But there\u2019s a chance. A life-bearing meteorite might have been ejected from Earth and could have landed in the water on Mars,\ufffd? he added. \n \n \n \n The search for life on Mars will ramp up in 2018 when the European Space Agency sends its Exomars rover to the red planet. The rover will look for chemical signatures of life, perhaps emanating from microbes living deep beneath the Martian soil. Last year, Nasa\u2019s Curiosity rover detected methane in the Martian atmosphere. The finding sparked intense speculation that the gas might be coming from living organisms. It might, but there is no evidence to suggest it is. Methane is regularly produced on planets through geological processes without any need for life. \n \n Charles Cockell, professor of astrobiology at Edinburgh University, said: \u201cThe longer water persists on a planetary body in one location, particularly if there is geological turnover, the more likely it is that it would provide a habitable environment for a suitable duration for life to either originate or proliferate. An ocean would meet this need.\ufffd? That life was possible does not make it inevitable though. \u201cOf course, it could have been uninhabited,\ufffd? he added. \n \n ||||| View Images Originally Earth and Mars had identical proportions of ordinary hydrogen and deuterium in their water. But on Mars the ordinary hydrogen has been gradually leaking into outer space\u2014the planet's thin atmosphere can be seen in this photo taken by the Viking 1 orbiter. \n \n Photograph by NASA \n \n Astronomers using some of the world's most powerful telescopes have determined that an ocean at least a mile deep covered a significant fraction of the Martian surface four billion years ago. \n \n This time, the evidence comes from an analysis of the water vapor that lingers today in the Martian atmosphere. A team of scientists led by Geronimo Villanueva, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, took a series of measurements of sunlight reflecting off the Martian surface and through the atmosphere, which revealed the chemical composition of the atmosphere's vapor. The hydrogen in water, whether it's on Mars or on Earth, comes in two varieties: ordinary hydrogen, whose nuclei contain just a proton, and \"heavy\" hydrogen, also known as deuterium, with a proton and a neutron. \n \n An ancient sea once covered a fifth of the planet\u2019s surface, astronomers found by calculating how much water the planet has lost over time. \n \n NASA/VILLANUEVA/MUMMA/GALLAGHER/FEIMER ET AL. \n \n Both Earth and Mars started out with identical proportions of ordinary hydrogen and deuterium in their water. But on Mars, with its weaker gravity, the ordinary hydrogen has been gradually leaking from the atmosphere out into space. As a result, Mars now has a higher proportion of deuterium in its water than Earth does\u2014seven times as high, in fact. Since the scientists can estimate the escape rate that would have led to this imbalance, Geronimo and his co-authors can calculate how much water overall there once was. \n \n It would have been enough, they say, that if it had covered the entire planet evenly, it would have reached a depth of about 450 feet (137 meters). In practice, says Geronimo, \"it probably would have formed an ocean in the northern hemisphere, which has a consistently lower altitude.\" \n \n \"Their results are quite believable,\" says James Kasting, a planetary scientist at Penn State. But they probably suggest only the minimum amount of water that pooled on the ancient surface of Mars, he says. \"My guess is that the true amount of water was much larger.\" \n \n The reason: A paper Kasting co-authored in 2014 argues that the early Martian atmosphere was unusually rich in heavy hydrogen and that much of it escaped along with the ordinary variety. That would skew any calculations based on today's values, he says. \n \n Either way, the evidence continues to mount that Mars was once far wetter\u2014and, since the water was mostly in liquid form rather than in the icy polar caps where it's now locked up, much warmer\u2014than it is today. That, along with increasing signs that the ancient chemical environment was hospitable to biology, means support for the notion that life might once have existed on Mars is only getting stronger.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Imagine all the water in the Arctic Ocean. Now, imagine all that and more on Mars. If you visited the Red Planet roughly 4.3 billion years ago, that's what you likely would have found, say NASA scientists. Their new study arrived at that \"solid estimate ... by determining how much water was lost to space,\" says lead author Geronimo Villanueva. The Guardian reports the scientists used three powerful infrared telescopes to analyze two forms of water in Mars' atmosphere: H2O and HDO, in which deuterium (aka \"heavy\" hydrogen) has taken the place of one hydrogen atom. As National Geographic explains, Mars' gravity is weaker than our own; that allowed hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere and into space over time, boosting the amount of deuterium in its water. Scientists compared the ratio of HDO to H2O in Martian water today with that in water from a 4.5 billion-year-old Mars meteorite to arrive at their conclusions, a press release states. They ultimately calculated that Mars was once home to 20 million cubic kilometers of ocean. It could have covered every inch of the planet in water 450 feet deep, but the scientists think a different scenario is more likely: that the ocean covered roughly a fifth of the planet, was located in the northern hemisphere, and was as much as a mile deep. While National Geographic observes the findings back up \"reams of earlier evidence that water once existed on the surface\" of Mars, another study author points out the assessment of the degree of water lost indicates something new. \"The planet was very likely wet for a longer period of time than was previously thought, suggesting it might have been habitable for longer,\" a scientist says.

Worldwide, it\u2019s the brand recommended most by dentists \n \n Colgate Total\u00ae toothpaste is uniquely formulated with 0.3% of the antibacterial ingredient triclosan to fight harmful plaque germs, which are the cause of most common oral health problems. \n \n There are more published, peer-reviewed clinical studies of Colgate Total \u00ae than of any other toothpaste in the world. The efficacy and safety of Colgate Total\u00ae is supported by more than 90 clinical studies, involving over 20,000 people, and a broad set of safety evaluations. Our research has been shared with regulatory agencies around the world who have accepted triclosan\u2019s safe and effective use in toothpaste. \n \n Colgate Total\u00ae is clinically proven to work better than other toothpastes in reducing the germs that can cause gum disease. It is clinically proven to provide 12-hour protection against plaque germs that can lead to gingivitis, an early form of gum disease. Over 75% of American adults suffer from gingivitis. Plaque and gingivitis, if unchecked, can progress to periodontitis, a more serious and damaging stage of infection that can result in tooth and bone loss. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, almost half of American adults age 30 and over have serious periodontal disease. \n \n Brushing with regular fluoride toothpaste does not provide the antibacterial protection of Colgate Total\u00ae toothpaste. On the US FDA\u2019s website, updated as of September 2, 2016, the FDA states as follows regarding Colgate Total\u00ae toothpaste: \"For some consumer products, there is evidence that triclosan provides a benefit.\" The FDA notes that it has \u201creviewed extensive effectiveness data on triclosan in Colgate Total toothpaste\" and that the \"evidence showed that triclosan in that product was effective in preventing gingivitis.\" \n \n Additionally, only Colgate Total\u00ae toothpaste provides both antibacterial protection and direct anti-inflammatory action, which is notable given the importance of good oral health and the emerging scientific research associating oral health with overall health. \n \n A thorough independent review was conducted and published by the Cochrane Oral Health Group on the oral health benefits of triclosan/copolymer, the active antibacterial system in Colgate Total\u00ae toothpaste. The Cochrane Review evaluated 30 studies dating from 1990 to 2012 and involving 14,835 participants (Riley & Lamont 2013). The resulting data highlighted the many clinical benefits of using a fluoride toothpaste containing triclosan/copolymer and concluded there was no evidence of any harmful effects associated with the use of triclosan/copolymer toothpastes in studies up to three years in duration.

Do you think those products will lower your risk of getting sick, spreading germs or being infected? \n \n According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), there isn\u2019t enough science to show that over-the-counter (OTC) antibacterial soaps are better at preventing illness than washing with plain soap and water. To date, the benefits of using antibacterial hand soap haven\u2019t been proven. In addition, the wide use of these products over a long time has raised the question of potential negative effects on your health. \n \n After studying the issue, including reviewing available literature and hosting public meetings, in 2013 the FDA issued a proposed rule requiring safety and efficacy data from manufacturers, consumers, and others if they wanted to continue marketing antibacterial products containing those ingredients, but very little information has been provided. That\u2019s why the FDA is issuing a final rule under which OTC consumer antiseptic wash products (including liquid, foam, gel hand soaps, bar soaps, and body washes) containing the majority of the antibacterial active ingredients\u2014including triclosan and triclocarban\u2014will no longer be able to be marketed. \n \n Why? Because the manufacturers haven\u2019t proven that those ingredients are safe for daily use over a long period of time. Also, manufacturers haven\u2019t shown that these ingredients are any more effective than plain soap and water in preventing illnesses and the spread of certain infections. Some manufacturers have already started removing these ingredients from their products, ahead of the FDA\u2019s final rule. \n \n \u201cFollowing simple handwashing practices is one of the most effective ways to prevent the spread of many types of infection and illness at home, at school and elsewhere,\u201d says Theresa M. Michele, MD, of the FDA\u2019s Division of Nonprescription Drug Products. \u201cWe can\u2019t advise this enough. It\u2019s simple, and it works.\u201d \n \n The FDA\u2019s final rule covers only consumer antibacterial soaps and body washes that are used with water. It does not apply to hand sanitizers or hand wipes. It also does not apply to antibacterial soaps that are used in health care settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes. \n \n What Makes Soap \u2018Antibacterial\u2019 \n \n Antibacterial soaps (sometimes called antimicrobial or antiseptic soaps) contain certain chemicals not found in plain soaps. Those ingredients are added to many consumer products with the intent of reducing or preventing bacterial infection. \n \n Many liquid soaps labeled antibacterial contain triclosan, an ingredient of concern to many environmental, academic and regulatory groups. Animal studies have shown that triclosan alters the way some hormones work in the body and raises potential concerns for the effects of use in humans. We don\u2019t yet know how triclosan affects humans and more research is needed. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s no data demonstrating that these drugs provide additional protection from diseases and infections. Using these products might give people a false sense of security,\u201d Michele says. \u201cIf you use these products because you think they protect you more than soap and water, that\u2019s not correct. If you use them because of how they feel, there are many other products that have similar formulations but won\u2019t expose your family to unnecessary chemicals. And some manufacturers have begun to revise these products to remove these ingredients.\u201d \n \n How do you tell if a product is antibacterial? For OTC drugs, antibacterial products generally have the word \u201cantibacterial\u201d on the label. Also, a Drug Facts label on a soap or body wash is a sign a product contains antibacterial ingredients. \n \n Triclosan and Health Concerns \n \n Triclosan can be found in many places today. It has been added to many consumer products\u2014including clothing, kitchenware, furniture, and toys\u2014to prevent bacterial contamination. Because of that, people\u2019s long-term exposure to triclosan is higher than previously thought, raising concerns about the potential risks associated with the use of this ingredient over a lifetime. \n \n In addition, laboratory studies have raised the possibility that triclosan contributes to making bacteria resistant to antibiotics. Some data shows this resistance may have a significant impact on the effectiveness of medical treatments, such as antibiotics. \n \n The FDA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have been closely collaborating on scientific and regulatory issues related to triclosan. This joint effort will help to ensure government-wide consistency in the regulation of this chemical. The two agencies are reviewing the effects of triclosan from two different perspectives. \n \n The EPA regulates the use of triclosan as a pesticide, and is in the process of updating its assessment of the effects of triclosan when it is used in pesticides. The FDA\u2019s focus is on the effects of triclosan when it is used by consumers on a regular basis in hand soaps and body washes. By sharing information, the two agencies will be better able to measure the exposure and effects of triclosan and how these differing uses of triclosan may affect human health. \n \n The EPA reevaluates each pesticide active ingredient every 15 years. The EPA\u2019s Final Work Plan for the triclosan risk assessment can be found in docket EPA-HQ-OPP-2012-0811. \n \n More on the FDA\u2019s Rule \n \n The FDA\u2019s rule doesn\u2019t yet apply to three chemicals (benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride and chloroxylenol). Manufacturers are developing and planning to submit new safety and effectiveness data for these ingredients. \n \n With the exception of those three ingredients that are still under study, all products that use the other 19 active ingredients will need to change their formulas or they will no longer be available to consumers. Manufacturers will have one year to comply with the rule. \n \n This rule doesn\u2019t apply to hand sanitizers. In June 2016, the FDA issued a proposed rule requesting additional scientific data from manufacturers showing that the active ingredients in hand sanitizers are generally recognized as safe and effective to reduce bacteria on skin. To learn about the difference between consumer hand sanitizers and consumer antibacterial soaps, visit our consumer information page. \n \n Consumers, Keep Washing with Plain Soap and Water \n \n So what should consumers do? Wash your hands with plain soap and water. That\u2019s still one of the most important steps you can take to avoid getting sick and to prevent spreading germs. \n \n September 2, 2016 \n \n back to top",

    "document": "LONDON, June 9 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain needed a period of stability and that she would take responsibility for delivering it if she won the most seats. \n \n \u201cAt this time, more than anything else this country needs a period of stability,\u201d May said after winning her own parliamentary seat. \n \n \u201cIf, as the indications have shown, and if this is correct that the Conservative Party has won the most seats and probably the most votes then it will be incumbent on us to ensure that we have that period of stability and that is exactly what we will do,\u201d May said. (Reporting Costas Pitas, writing by William James editing by Guy Faulconbridge) ||||| When no party gets enough seats in the House of Commons to form a majority Government the result is described as a hung parliament. \n \n Parties must get more than 326 MPs in order to have a majority. \n \n If nobody does, someone has to try and form a stable Government and this can ultimately mean the party which technically comes second in the election can form a ruling body instead. \n \n What happens next? \n \n The incumbent Government - the last one before the election - stays in Number 10 until a new Government can be formed. \n \n Theresa May will not move out and talks will begin to see if the Conservatives can find enough support from other parties to rule. \n \n So does Theresa May get the first shot at forming a coalition? \n \n Yes. Although it doesn't mean she will definitely be the next Prime Minister. If the Conservatives get close to the magic 326 number on their own they may be able to borrow support from the DUP, a party which tends to vote with them anyway. \n \n Talks will begin to try and see who can make a deal work. One of the two parties with a realistic chance - the Conservatives or Labour - could also choose to govern as a minority and find support from other MPs as and when they need to get a vote through parliament. \n \n This is much harder than governing with a majority, even a small one. \n \n What happens if she fails? \n \n If Theresa May can't get the numbers it will be Labour's chance to try and do the same unless the Tories want to try their luck with a minority. \n \n She will be expected to resign. \n \n Labour could borrow support from other parties, although the Lib Dems have ruled this out and Jeremy Corbyn vowed not to work with the Scottish Nationals. \n \n Do the voters get a say? \n \n No. Once the general election has taken place and no overall decision has been made it's up to the parties to make the best of it as the Conservatives and the Lib Dems did in 2010. \n \n How long does it take? \n \n There is no time limit to agree a new Government. In 2010 it took five days, although many people thought this was too quick and important details were missed, leading to problems further down the line. \n \n Either way neither of the parties will want to take too long about it because the Brexit negotiations begin 11 days after polling day. \n \n And Parliament will meet again on the 13 June, so someone has to have come up with a solution by then. Mrs May has the option of waiting until this date to see if she has the confidence of the Commons too. \n \n A Queen's Speech must be presented by 19 June, either by Mrs May or Mr Corbyn. Parliament must vote the speech through so this is the key test for a new Government. \n \n Does the Queen have a say? \n \n No, the Queen doesn't get involved in politics at all. But there are suggestions she may not deliver the speech if she is not sure it will be voted through Parliament. \n \n Could there be another election? \n \n Possibly. If the Conservatives form a minority Government the Prime Minister could seek another election later in the year. This is what Ted Heath did in 1974 when he won a majority the second time around, but it is a risk. \n \n If MPs table a no-confidence motion in the sitting Government a new election could be triggered as long as the opposition also couldn't form a Government. \n \n This is where it all gets a bit complicated though. If there is a no-confidence motion in Theresa May she could hand the leadership of her party to a colleague, who could seek to form a Government. \n \n If they can't, power could be handed to Labour but this would be uncharted territory because it means the governing party would change without an election. This would be unprecedented. \n \n Analysis from Kate McCann \n \n Election Bulletin ||||| Getty Images Copyright: Getty Images \n \n That's all from us for tonight - but before we go, here's a round-up of what's happened in an extraordinary day. \n \n Election ends in hung Parliament: Conservatives win 318 seats, Labour 262 \n \n Speaking after visiting Buckingham Palace, Theresa May said only her party had the \"legitimacy\" to govern, despite falling eight seats short of a majority. \n \n PM confirms five top cabinet posts, including chancellor and foreign secretary \n \n Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon, Brexit Secretary David Davis, Home Secretary Amber Rudd, Chancellor Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson all keep their positions. \n \n Tories to form government with DUP to 'provide certainty' and keep country 'safe' \n \n It is thought Mrs May will seek some kind of informal arrangement that could see the DUP \"lend\" its support to the Tories on a vote-by-vote basis, known as \"confidence and supply\". \n \n Theresa May's government 'will carry on Brexit negotiations to existing timetable' \n \n European Council president Donald Tusk has warned the UK that time is running out and there was a risk of a \"no deal\" outcome as a result of no negotiations taking place. \n \n Jeremy Corbyn hails Labour's 'incredible result' and calls for May to resign \n \n He said the PM should \"make way\" for a government that would be \"truly representative of the people of this country\" and said Labour was ready to form a minority government of its own. \n \n The Lib Dems' Tim Farron also calls on May to quit \n \n The party said Mrs May should be \"ashamed\" of carrying on. \n \n SNP will work with others to keep 'reckless' Tories out 'if at all possible' \n \n The SNP remains the largest party in Scotland but lost 21 seats to the Tories, Labour and the Lib Dems. \n \n Paul Nuttall resigns as UKIP leader after the party won no seats \n \n He said it was clear \"UKIP requires a new focus and new ideas\" but was confident it had a \"great future\". He also deleted his Twitter and Facebook accounts. \n \n Follow continuing developments over the weekend here. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images \n \n The general election has ended in a hung Parliament, where no party has the 326 seats needed to get an overall majority in the House of Commons. \n \n So what happens now? \n \n Who is the prime minister? \n \n Theresa May remains prime minister. She plans to form a minority government, relying on the Democratic Unionist Party for support. \n \n Does this mean there will definitely be a Conservative government? \n \n If the DUP supports the Conservatives, then yes, they would together have more than the 326 seats required for a majority to pass a legislative programme. \n \n The two parties are currently in discussion, DUP leader Arlene Foster said. And the Conservatives, as the government in power before the general election, get the first attempt at forming an administration. \n \n In theory, if they fail to secure DUP backing, Labour could attempt to form its own minority government. But this is unlikely. \n \n Image copyright Getty Images \n \n How do the numbers stack up? \n \n The Conservatives and the DUP: 328 \n \n Labour, SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Green: 314 \n \n A reminder: The magic number required for a Commons majority is 326. \n \n Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Find your constituency and candidates Enter a postcode or seat name Start typing to search Search for constituencies \n \n How does a minority government actually work? \n \n If the Conservatives go forward as a minority administration, they will fill all the ministerial positions themselves. \n \n But they will rely on the support of the DUP to help them pass legislation. \n \n Key to this is an arrangement called \"confidence and supply\" whereby the DUP would support the Tories if a vote of no confidence was called and help them to pass their Budget. \n \n Negotiations would still be needed to prevent ordinary day-to-day government business from being defeated. \n \n How long will it last? \n \n Theresa May has said her government will provide \"stability\" going into Brexit negotiations. And the next general election isn't due until 2022. \n \n But maintaining party unity and passing the government's bills will be a tricky task with so little room for rebellion - and the DUP are sure to make their own demands in return for propping up Mrs May's government. \n \n The BBC's Mark D'Arcy predicts a Conservative/DUP alliance faces a \"long, precarious high-wire act\", which will be \"beset by troubles and entanglements at every turn\". \n \n If the government grinds to a halt as a result, another general election could become unavoidable. \n \n This can only happen if: \n \n Two-thirds of MPs vote for it. In practice, it would need to be supported by both Labour and the Conservatives. Or: \n \n MPs pass a motion of no confidence in the government AND an existing or new government cannot win a confidence vote in the Commons within 14 days of the no-confidence vote \n \n Has minority government happened before? \n \n Several elections resulted in minority government in the early part of the 20th century. \n \n Governments have also started out with majorities which were then lost due to by-elections and defections. \n \n Labour had a majority of three after the 1974 general election - but this had vanished by 1977, and it stayed in power thanks to a \"pact\" with the Liberal Party. \n \n And John Major's Conservative government started out with a majority of 21 in 1992 but was a minority government by the 1997 general election. \n \n When will things be finalised? \n \n The first deadline is Tuesday 13 June, when the new Parliament meets for the first time. \n \n Mrs May has until this date to put together a deal to keep herself in power or resign, according to official guidance issued by the Cabinet Office. \n \n She is entitled to wait until the new Parliament to see if she has the confidence of the House of Commons. \n \n The government then needs to see if it can assemble the votes it needs to get its programme of proposed new laws passed in the Queen's Speech, which is scheduled for Monday 19 June. \n \n This is when it will be relying on the DUP's support. \n \n What about a coalition? \n \n Image copyright PA Image caption David Cameron and Nick Clegg led a coalition after the 2010 general election \n \n A coalition is when two or more parties join forces to govern as a single unit. \n \n The junior partners are given ministerial jobs and a joint programme for government is set out. \n \n This is what happened in 2010, when the Conservatives and Lib Dems teamed up, but it is unlikely this time given the numbers involved and the parties' statements. \n \n Labour has ruled one out - and in any case an alliance with the Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cymru and Greens would still leave it short of a majority. \n \n What will happen to the Brexit talks? \n \n The talks are currently due to begin on 19 June but if it takes a while to form a government it could ask the EU for a delay. \n \n The EU Parliament's chief negotiator said the outcome \"will make already complex negotiations even more complicated\". \n \n What would you like to know about the election results and what happens next?

Momentum played a major part in this. \n \n \u201cI think it is the end of the old way of doing politics.\u201d \n \n While most of the media focus was on Corbyn, Labour was engaged in a largely unseen effort on the ground, using its large base of volunteers as a counter to the Conservatives\u2019 higher spending. \n \n Klug had been a primary teacher when he volunteered in 2015 to work in Corbyn\u2019s first leadership contest and went on to work full-time for Momentum, which grew out of the campaign. \n \n He and his colleagues have not yet celebrated. \u201cWe did not win,\u201d said Klug, who said the organisation would continue campaigning, building for the next time. \n \n Labour had won more seats than he had expected. Had all the speculation that Corbyn would have to resign or face another leadership challenge now gone? \u201cI think definitely,\u201d Klug said. \n \n During the election, Momentum developed a tool to help direct volunteers to the nearest marginals: the site attracted 100,000 unique users. \n \n \n \n \u201cThis was five times the size of Momentum. We reached out way beyond our bubble,\u201d Klug said. \n \n One in four UK Facebook users had viewed a Momentum video in the final week of the campaign, he said. They also developed an app to help people engage in phone-canvassing from their homes or anywhere else rather than go to phone banks. \n \n With the help of about half a dozen volunteers from the Bernie Sanders campaign, it introduced techniques pioneered during the US campaign, with a big effort aimed at training canvassers. Three thousand came to training days throughout the UK, about two-thirds of them first-time canvassers, Klug said. \n \n Momentum asked for volunteers to take Thursday off to get people to the polls. Klug said about 10,000 volunteered, knocking on an estimated 1.2m doors. ||||| A night of political shocks has seen a number of high profile figures lose their seats in the House of Commons. \n \n Here's who has suffered defeat so far:",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 She gambled on an early election\u2014and she lost, big time. Theresa May and the Conservative Party have been dealt a huge blow in Britain's election, with the party losing its majority in Parliament after early predictions that it would gain as many as 80 seats. Full results have yet to arrive, but a hung parliament, in which no party has a majority, is now inevitable, reports the BBC. The Conservatives still have the most seats but Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party was the night's big winner, gaining more than 30 seats in Parliament, while the pro-Brexit United Kingdom Independence Party saw its share of the vote collapse. In Scotland, the Scottish National Party saw a fall in support, with former party leader Alex Salmond among those losing their seats. The latest: With Corbyn\u2014and plenty of angry Conservatives\u2014calling for her resignation, May signaled that she will stay on for now, Reuters reports. \"At this time, more than anything else this country needs a period of stability,\" she said early Friday after she was re-elected to her own seat in Parliament. The inconclusive election was result was seen as a disaster by negotiators in Brussels, where Brexit talks are due to begin within days, the Guardian reports. May, who wasn't required to hold an election until 2020, said her reason for calling one early was to secure a greater mandate for the talks. \"Could be messy for the United Kingdom in the years ahead,\" tweeted former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt. \"One mess risks following another. Price to be paid for lack of true leadership.\" Senior Conservative officials tell the Telegraph that May made \"fundamental strategic errors\" during the campaign. \"This is bad, it's worse than bad. Her advisers should walk out of the door now never to return, regardless of the final result,\" one senior official says. Numerous senior Conservative MPs have lost their seats, including manifesto author Ben Gummer. The BBC looks at what is likely to happen now that a hung parliament has been confirmed. Unless she chooses to resign, May is expected to remain as prime minister while she attempts to form a coalition government with smaller parties. ITV looks at election night's biggest losers, including Nick Clegg.

    "document": "A random mom on the playground, looking serious and a little bit concerned, asks me, \"Do you think your son might grow up to be gay?\" \n \n Random Moms across America think they know: My son has got to be gay. He wears khakis today but wore a dress to school from age 4 to 6; he used to do ballet and still doesn't like sports; in preschool he was all about playing princess but now is all about Pokemon; and, in spite of the clear gender divisions in third grade, he plays with both girls and boys. I mean, what straight boy is into that kinda freaky gender mash-up? \n \n Well, my husband, for one. And all metrosexuals, for another coupla-million-ish. My husband used to help his mother choose curtains. He now drives a motorcycle and hunts deer. He still likes curtains, which he now calls \"window treatments\" (How gay is that? Random Mom mutters). But really, haven't you met a guy like this, the one you think is gay when you first met him, but then realize that his sexuality doesn't match his gender presentation? \n \n And if you get busy thinking about femmy boys who grow up to be straight, you might also start thinking about butch boys who grow up to be gay, like all those bears and leather daddies I see walking around the Castro. Then you might have to admit that, though it often does, childhood gender expression doesn't always correlate to adult sexuality. \n \n I recently discovered that America's favorite telepsychologist and I actually agree on that. Dr. Phil's website tells Robby, the mother of a 5-year-old boy who loves Barbies and wearing feminine clothes: \"This is not a precursor to your son being gay.\" \n \n I got a little excited reading this. The conflation of gender expression and sexuality is so ubiquitous in our society that it was refreshing to hear our country's second-highest-rated talk show host giving the same message to millions of Americans that I've given to dozens (literally dozens!) of Random Moms on playgrounds across my fair city. Reading on, however, the beautiful Dr. Phil/Ms. Hoffman mind-meld crumbles. \n \n Dr. Phil -- who implores us all to \"get real\" -- tells Robby that she should not buy her son Barbie dolls or \"girl's\" clothes, and that she should \"Take the girl things away, and buy him boy toys ... Support him in what he's doing, but not in the girl things.\" Support him, but take away the things he loves to play with? \n \n And does Dr. Phil really imagine that Robby's son will stop being interested in Barbie just because Robby throws his dolls in the trash? What kid forgets about his favorite toy just because it's been taken away? (What kid doesn't want the forbidden thing more when it's taken away?) As Dr. Phil advises Robby, Random Moms advise me to encourage my son to do \"boy\" things like play soccer and get fixated on trains. But really, has that ever worked? Think about it: How easy is it to force a tomboy into a dress? A girly-girl into playing football? And I'd really like to see Dr. Phil make a sports-loving he-boy wear Tinkerbell underpants. And like it. \n \n Gender identity isn't something we just impose on kids and expect them to suck it up, like eating vegetables or going to school. It's part of who they are, whether that satisfies us as parents or not. \n \n I write (under a pen name) about raising my gender-nonconforming son for magazines, radio, and my blog. I get all kinds of e-mail from readers telling me that if I just stopped encouraging my son to be girly that he'd man up and try out for the football team. Ah, yes: I am the All Powerful Mother, whose magic is strong enough to make boys run from Thomas trains to pink tutus. Really, I'm that good. And if I just directed my magic toward good and not evil, then my boy would become all boy. \n \n The problem is that, as a mother, I'm too powerful. Or too weak. We're not sure which. Because I've also been told that I need to learn to parent forcefully, to learn to stand up and say NO. That my son wouldn't be like he is if I simply didn't allow him to be like he is. But here's the truth: I'm actually kind of a NO-saying badass. Check me out: Can we throw this baseball in the kitchen? NO. Can we eat chocolate cake for breakfast? NO. Can we make fun of the girl in the wheelchair? NO. I really can haul out a NO when I need to, and I whip it out many times a day. But I try to save NO for things that actually cause demonstrable harm to property, to my children or to other people. \n \n Is it really my maternal strength/weakness that caused my son to adore pink Marabou-feather slippers at age 3? You decide. But consider that mothers have regularly been blamed for their children's -- especially their sons' -- quirks and challenges. \n \n In the 1950s, psychologist Leo Kanner coined the phrase \"refrigerator mother\" and used it to blame mothers for causing autism in their children (needless to say, Kanner's theory was later discredited by actual science). From the academic paper Children, Work, and Family: Some Thoughts on \"Mother Blame,\" we learn that mothers have similarly been blamed for a host of issues in their offspring including schizophrenia, bed-wetting, learning disabilities and, my personal favorite, \"homicidal transsexualism.\" \n \n You may remember momblogger Nerdy Apple Bottom (who goes by the name of Sarah -- no relation), whose November blog post My Son Is Gay went viral and has now generated over 46,000 comments. After her post, Sarah was chastised by her church for standing up to the other preschool mothers who criticized her and her son for the way he busted out of gender norms (on Halloween! We're not even talking about the glamfest that has walked out of my house on any old Tuesday). Her church accused her of \"promoting gayness\" and threatened to kick her out of the entire denomination. \n \n The notion that parents are responsible for spreading gayness (like butter, or an STD) is one buoyed by conservative religious organizations like Exodus International and Focus on the Family. Focus' ousted founder, the famed radiovangelist James Dobson, offers his book \"Bringing up Boys\" as a guide for \"parents to lay a healthy foundation for heterosexual identity for their children.\" In other words, to use reparative therapy to try to ungay them before the gayness spreads. \n \n Joseph Nicolosi, founder of NARTH, the National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality, penned the DIY reparative therapy bible, \"A Parent's Guide to Preventing Homosexuality.\" NARTH has long and loudly argued that feminine boys are pre-homosexuals who can be ungayed with a just-so combination of a mom who backs off and a dad who takes his son out to pump gas and light the barbeque. \n \n It would seem that Dr. Phil has torn a page from Nicolosi's book, a book in which Nicolosi tells parents to replace feminine toys, games and clothing with masculine ones, stressing the importance of \"extinguishing feminine behavior\" with \"gentle and consistent disapproval.\" But where these two popular scolds differ is on the moral value of homosexuality. \n \n Dr. Phil sides with the American Psychiatric Association, publisher of the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,\" broadly considered the arbiter of mental health. The APA declassified homosexuality as a mental illness nearly 40 years ago. Dr. Phil tells Robby, \"If your son is gay ... it won't be a choice. It will be something that he's pre-wired to do.\" Elsewhere on his website, Dr. Phil tells a mother concerned about her lesbian daughter, \"Homosexuality is not a learned behavior. A sexual orientation is inherited. You are wired that way.\" He asks, \"What difference does it make if she is gay? Accept her, support her, and do not be judgmental. It is difficult enough for her to live openly and honestly in this society. Don't put your judgment on top of that.\" \n \n But definitely rain that judgment down on your 5-year-old son. \n \n So I'm really trying to figure this out. Dr. Phil tells us that it's OK to be gay (just like the APA), but it's not OK for boys to play with Barbie (just like NARTH), because ... well, that's where I get stuck. Because ... they might grow up to be gay? But ... they won't necessarily, he says. And around we go. \n \n Perhaps Dr. Phil's thought process is just terribly muddled (the more charitable explanation among those I've considered). A more likely explanation is that Dr. Phil really isn't OK with homosexuality and thinks that it can be prevented in boyhood if you just chuck the Barbies and say NO. If so, he hides this message fairly well -- or at least confuses his viewers with his homos-good/proto-homos-bad schtick. \n \n And speaking of confusion, Dr. Phil tells Robby, \"Direct your son in an unconfusing way ... You don't want to do things that seem to support the confusion at this stage of the game.\" \n \n Who's confused? My son knows exactly what he likes. When Sam was 4 and his male peers trick-or-treated as Batman and Spiderman and gorillas, Sam was a princess. At 5, he was a queen, regal and proud and full of the royal prowess that Disney offers all little girls. He liked feather boas and lip gloss and dancing. Did he think he was a girl? Nope. Was he confused about being a boy? Nope. Did he need to be taught what boys are supposed to like? Nope -- how boys are supposed to behave was abundantly clear from the trains and trucks we bought him before we realized he was a pink boy, the behavior of all the boys he knew, the messages on TV, and the judgments of all the Random Moms. He just liked what he liked, the way other kids did -- only his likes were different. \n \n Anti-gay organizations are clear about why boys like Sam need to change. But Dr. Phil's muddled message reflects a broader, mostly unspoken cultural bias in America -- even among Americans who are accepting of gay people -- that femmy boys are somehow nebulously bad (though no one can actually articulate why). Dr. Phil -- or NARTH -- isn't making a stink over girls who wear jeans and play soccer. So what, exactly, is wrong with a boy who likes Barbie? \n \n America, talk to me. I'm all ears. And if you can't think of an un-muddled answer, then think about this: Everywhere -- on playgrounds and in homes across America, in Disney movies and on national television, on high school and college campuses -- pink boys are the brunt of jokes, made to feel inferior, mocked until they take their own lives. Feminine boys are among the last people it's OK for our culture to hate. \n \n Indeed, one of the most popular arguments against letting boys express their feminine sides is that people will make fun of them. Which makes me wonder: should we hide who we are because people are mean? Or should we -- parents, teachers, bystanders, infotainment talk-show hosts -- stand up and say it's not acceptable to make fun of people who are different? \n \n Random Mom doesn't know who or what my son is going to grow up to be, any more than she knows who or what her kid is going to grow up to be. Whether or not she shares the judgments of America's religious conservatives and reparative therapists, or even Dr. Phil, she's repeating cultural biases that she's absorbed, raising her eyebrows at the things that might, to her, signal future gayness. In this I can hear the click of the first domino falling into the second in the cascade that flows from judgment to disapproval to bullying. As social acceptance of gay people grows, it's time to look critically at the lingering disapproval of things we once thought were precursors to gayness. \n \n Because the problem ain't Barbies. It's bullies. ||||| There is, remarkably, a 28-year-old woman who is running for Congress from Virginia named Krystal Ball (JESUS CHRIST, BAD PARENTS). As we have, apparently, noted in the past, this woman is quite attractive, in terms of fornication. But we wrote that before photos showed up on the Internet of her fellating a Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer dildo on her then-husband\u2019s face at a Christmas party. Will Krystal Ball be the first dildo-fellating member of Congress? No, certainly not! Probably every current member of Congress has done this. But it\u2019s still fun to see, right? Especially when there are quite a few of these photos? \n \n Krystal Ball has responded by saying it\u2019s really sexist to post these photos. Because it\u2019s not sexist to post male members of Congress fellating dildos? We don\u2019t understand. Let us enjoy these photos of you, lady. And if anyone has photos of any candidates for Congress, male or female, sucking on dildos, please send them along. \n \n If anything, that last one is sexist.

Pat has decided to make her case directly to the voters, as to why they should reelect her, and she remains true to form. In striving for a better-informed electorate, we\u2019ve analyzed her statements made over at Potomac Local, and will dissect these statements, exposing the lies and half-truths contained therein: \n \n (more\u2026) \n \n By Greg L | 31 October 2017 | Manassas City | 3 Comments \n \n We\u2019ve uncovered much regarding Patricia Ritchie-Folks (and all the other aliases she\u2019s used over the years), and have started to dive down into what she\u2019s done in the many places she\u2019s lived, but really we\u2019ve only covered her time in Georgia. Looking at it now, it\u2019s as if Sherman\u2019s March to the Sea got intermingled with a caravan of Gypsy fraudsters. Where did the \u201cPat Show\u201d go next? Tough to say, what with all of those overlapping names and addresses, Paticia Richie-(Pick-a-name here) was using. As best as we can tell, Pat (is it REALLY Pat?) landed in Florida. Perhaps Florida was a chance to get a \u201cfresh start\u201d. She settled in a modest apartment, not far from the beach, near Miami. Who wouldn\u2019t want a little time in the Sun? But, it seems that Pat couldn\u2019t break some of her old habits. You know, like paying her bills. Pat was sued by a company that provides care for the elderly: (more\u2026) \n \n By Greg L | 26 October 2017 | Manassas City | 4 Comments \n \n What a great question! So many aliases. So many addresses. So much overlap. We are sure that you can understand why it has taken so long to unravel this web, woven by this spider who now holds the city\u2019s check-book in her hands. Undaunted, we entered her parlor of deception not as flies, but as wasps and hornets, looking for possible reasons as to \u201cwhy\u201d Pat (are we sure it\u2019s Pat?) has gone to such great effort to hide her background. There are as many possibilities as there are names and addresses, but we managed to find that common thread, made of spider-silk, that leads to the center of the web: Money. \n \n Pat (who currently goes by the name Patricia Richie-Folks) likes to talk about her \u201cvast financial experience\u201d that she brings to the office of treasurer. Oh, she does indeed have financial experience, just not the kind that many of us might aspire to have. (more\u2026) \n \n By Greg L | 25 October 2017 | Manassas City | 6 Comments \n \n We all know who Patricia Richie-Folks claims to be. She\u2019s a financial expert with deep connections to the City of Manassas, right?. She\u2019s was a \u201cco-owner\u201d and \u201cpayroll manager\u201d of a construction company. The problem is, \u201cPat\u201d (can we call you Pat?) has presented little in the way of specifics regarding her life, prior to moving into the city. The local press, in an abdication of its traditional role as \u201cseekers of the truth\u201d, has done little except to print Pat\u2019s vague descriptions of her vast experience, leaving it to someone else us to do the actual work normally associated with that arcane practice once known as \u201cjournalism.\u201d \n \n Well, we\u2019ve been working. Someone has to. Using publicly-available information and a high-level of determination, our team of citizen investigators have uncovered much in the way of the enigma that is the recently-elected City of Manassas Treasurer, and don\u2019t think for a moment we\u2019d keep all the juicy bits from you. \n \n (more\u2026) \n \n By Greg L | 24 October 2017 | Manassas City | 4 Comments \n \n Patricia Richie-Folks was elected City Treasurer during a special election last year, which happened to coincide with the Presidential and Congressional elections. Richie-Folks rode a wave of local anti-Trump sentiment and a woefully inept local press to a 2%-margin win over her opponent, Russ Harrison. It should be noted that this was Richie-Folks third attempt at elected office, having twice previously failed to garner enough support to be elected to Manassas City Council. \n \n So why was \u201cthree the charm\u201d for Richie-Folks? Why did she win over someone obviously better qualified for the position? Who is Patricia Richie-Folks? What special qualifications did she bring to the office? These are all legitimate questions that need to be answered\u2026and we will answer them. However, the biggest question is, what in Patricia Richie-Folks background might otherwise disqualify her from office, or at least give the informed voter sufficient reason not to pull the lever for this individual of questionable character? \n \n (more\u2026) \n \n By Greg L | 28 August 2017 | Crime, Manassas City, Prince William County | 1 Comment \n \n The Manassas Tea Party released the following press advisory late Sunday evening: \n \n Manassas Tea Party Denounces Arrival of Violent AntiFa Groups \n \n Calls on Community to Refrain from Lending Support and Counter-Protesting \n \n The Manassas Tea Party is denouncing a potential influx of AntiFa groups into Prince William County, Manassas City and the Manassas National Battlefield Park over the Labor Day weekend in what is being called \u201cThe March to Confront White Supremacy.\u201d \n \n \u201cAfter the recent violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, citizens of Manassas and Prince William County, peace-loving, tolerant and law-abiding people, are broadly opposed to the potential for similar racial strife and bloodshed in their backyard.\u201d Manassas Tea Party Chairman Dan Arnold said. \u201cWhether it is being stirred up by white supremacists or by AntiFa activists, Manassas residents have no interest in having their community and history used as political pawns in an increasingly dangerous game of \u2018Gotcha\u2019\u201d. \n \n AntiFa-affiliated groups and white nationalists have a history of engaging in violence and destruction that is antithetical to the Constitution and the Rule of Law and neither should be welcomed in Manassas. The majority of agitators from these groups typically do not reside in the communities they infiltrate and are often bused in from outside locales. Thus they have to rely on support from local organizations for lodging, food, etc. \n \n Manassas Tea Party is calling on all residents, businesses and religious entities in particular to refrain from lending support to this effort or any counter-protesting efforts which only seek to divide us, damage the historic nature of our community, and encourage violence and destruction. The organization is also calling on local governments and law enforcement to be vigilant in preparing for and acting upon the potential destruction of public property and the outbreak of violence. \n \n There is no credible evidence that has been made public that such groups involved have applied or intend to apply for any permits to stage demonstrations in the City or at Manassas National Battlefield Park, a potential legal violation. \n \n \u201cWe believe firmly in the First Amendment right to free speech but also advocate for upholding the rule of law. We\u2019re not a political organization and we don\u2019t take sides.\u201d Arnold said. \u201cBut we hope that all citizens and organizations in the Manassas area will speak with one voice that manufactured political violence is not welcome in our town, regardless of ideology.\u201d \n \n The Manassas Tea Party is a 501(c)4 non-profit organization of hundreds of Manassas and greater Manassas area citizens dedicated to preserving constitutional principles of every level of government. Its mission is to inform about the issues of the day, influence friends and neighbors to engage, and inspire those around us with a message of hope. \n \n By Greg L | 27 August 2017 | Crime, Manassas City | No Comments \n \n AntiFa is coming to Manassas next weekend on their way to call for an overthrow of the federal government in DC. Let\u2019s hope this faction of AntiFa isn\u2019t in the lead. \n \n By Greg L | 14 July 2017 | Patriotism, Crime | 5 Comments \n \n A lot of folks I know are quite concerned about large-scale civil disturbances after watching events unfold such as happened in DC, Ferguson and Baltimore, along with the re-emergence of violent anarchists such as AntiFa. Commercial property is set ablaze, cars are firebombed, cops get shot and wide swaths of the community are vandalized, looted and burned. When these happen our social media feeds get clobbered with posts displaying in real time the shocking violence perpetrated by rioters who seem rather insane, and ineffective law enforcement responses to this violence which only seems to make the problem worse. The question of how safe our families and communities are, and what we can do to address this threat inevitably rises. \n \n Those aren\u2019t easy question to definitively answer, but it certainly is a lot easier to get close when you consider that large-scale, violent civil disturbances aren\u2019t anything new in this country. We just haven\u2019t had a whole lot of them in most people\u2019s memory, and the earlier ones happened before everyone was carrying around a mobile phone with a camera. \n \n (more\u2026) \n \n By Greg L | 5 July 2017 | Illegal Aliens, Crime | No Comments \n \n Of the 22 murders in Prince William County in 2016, eight of them were at the hands of persons known to be illegal aliens. The press also reports that 1 of the 10 persons arrested for rape in the county were illegal aliens as well. Gee, the press would have you think that crime coming from illegal aliens is becoming less and less of a problem now, wouldn\u2019t you? Well, that\u2019s what some folks want you to think. \n \n The problem here is that Prince William County lost all visibility over whether an arrestee was an illegal alien back in 2012 when the federal government under the Obama Administration terminated the Section 287(g) program. Before then, law enforcement officials were able to verify a suspect\u2019s immigration status when they were taken into custody using federal resources under the supervision of an ICE agent. If the individual was foreign-born and had a record of legal entry, was admitted as a nonresident or resident alien, or naturalized as a citizen, he was known to be a legal alien. The absence of such a record indicated he was an illegal alien, and that system swept up illegal aliens by the thousands. It worked very well. \n \n (more\u2026) \n \n By Greg L | 30 June 2017 | Local Economy | 5 Comments \n \n All you folks with a \u201cverizon.net\u201d email address are going to have a decision to make shortly.

Or do you sign up with someone else, tie their corporate identity to your own, tell all your friends about your new email address and hope that at some point they don\u2019t do the same thing to you as Verizon just did and start this all over again? \n \n Well, there\u2019s another answer and long ago I charted a course that you\u2019re free to follow. \n \n (more\u2026) \n \n By Greg L | 28 June 2017 | Manassas City, 50th HOD District | 2 Comments \n \n We\u2019re saddened tonight by the news that Suzanne Miller, wife of Delegate Jackson Miller, has passed away following a long battle with cancer.

Eventually, the \u201cMath Investigations\u201d curriculum would be replaced and one of the leading proponents of that program on the school board would be defeated by Alyson Satterwhite. That group has been one of the most long-standing and impactful resources for parents who want to have a voice in how their taxpayer dollars are spent educating their children. \n \n Of course the Prince William Education Association and the Virginia Education Association teacher lobbies felt threatened by this. These left-leaning lobbies, slavishly devoted to the Democrat party and the principle that elites should dictate what the proletariat is allowed to get, fought bitterly against the parents on PW Education Reform at every turn. After name calling and public bullying didn\u2019t seem to work, they settled on a different strategy - to embed themselves in these parent resources, try to take them over, and eventually destroy them. Last night they celebrated what they think is a victory in wiping out this six year experiment in representative democracy. \n \n (more\u2026) \n \n By Greg L | 22 June 2017 | 13th HOD District | 8 Comments \n \n Danica Roem is the 33 year-old \u201ctransgender\u201d former reporter who still hasn\u2019t moved out of his parent\u2019s house, but is running for the 13th District House of Delegates seat as a Democrat. Not too surprisingly he\u2019s getting a lot of his funding for the campaign with out-of-state donors, one of which is Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele who coughed up a remarkable $25,000. \n \n It turns out that this multi-millionaire can easily afford to be this generous with Roem\u2019s campaign given that he hasn\u2019t paid any state taxes in Wisconsin since 2010. \n \n When Roem inevitably starts talking about the rich \u201cpaying their fair share\u201d of taxes I hope he can use his donors as a demonstration of the problem. \n \n By Greg L | 20 June 2017 | Schools, PWCDC, Prince William County | 11 Comments \n \n Here\u2019s the story that the leftists supporting Prince William County School Board Chairman desperately do not want you to see on social media, so perhaps it\u2019s time to at least suspend my hiatus from blogging. \n \n Tomorrow night the School Board is going to have a meeting where Democrats are almost certainly going to enshrine special protections for \u201ctransgender\u201d staff and students in official school policy. Given that in the past five years there hasn\u2019t been a single incident where any \u201ctransgender\u201d persons has reported any problems, the result of this policy will be to arm activists with a cudgel to beat down anyone who even expresses discomfort when they\u2019re forced to share private areas with people of the opposite sex. It\u2019s a tremendously effective way to enforce groupthink, as the purpose of policy is to define behavior deserving of punishment, not to enable anyone to do anything. \n \n (more\u2026) \n \n By Greg L | 4 January 2017 | 13th HOD District | 6 Comments \n \n If you were a Democrat not suffering from a mental disability, the announcement of your candidate running against Bob Marshall probably wouldn\u2019t be headlined \u201cTransgender journalist challenges Bob Marshall for 13th House seat.\u201d No, I\u2019m not making this up. \n \n The mainstream media\u2019s approval rate is a mere 32% according to Gallup, so 68% of the electorate already thinks journalists are inherently untrustworthy.

It\u2019s not as if government is running out of money any time soon, right? Well, Mark Wolfe has apparently accomplished the impossible after filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy earlier this month while at the same time campaigning about what a responsible steward he is with the money you are forced to give government. \n \n You just can\u2019t make this stuff up. \n \n No mention has been made so far about his firing of Patricia Richie-Folks as treasurer of the Manassas Ballet (at the same time she apparently owns a construction company, curiously enough) for incompetence. Word is that Richie-Folks couldn\u2019t manage to execute a T-shirt sale without basic math errors, requiring the Manassas Ballet to reach back with an additional assessment for $15 items unless they wanted to lose money on their fund raiser. And yes, this individual is running for City Treasurer. \n \n What a pair. A person who can\u2019t pay his bills spending your money, and someone who can\u2019t do basic math cutting the checks. That\u2019s your Democrat ticket in Manassas. \n \n Hang on for a data dump of some court filings.

    "document": "People around the world prepare for the coming of the new year. \n \n BEIJING | \n \n BEIJING (Reuters) - Two young Tibetan monks set themselves on fire to protest against government religious controls in western China on Monday, two exiled Tibetan sources said, the third such protest this year that could spark fresh tension in the unstable region. \n \n The 18-year-old monks, Kelsang and Kunchak, belong to the Kirti monastery -- a major site of protest against Chinese policies and the scene of a harsh crackdown by security forces in May -- one India-based exiled Tibetan activist, told Reuters. \n \n The monks' self-immolations could lead to a renewed crackdown in Aba prefecture, a heavily ethnic Tibetan part of Sichuan province that many advocates of self-rule say should form part of a larger homeland under Tibetan control. \n \n \"When they set themselves on fire, they shouted: 'We need freedom of religion,'\" said the activist, who asked not to be identified, adding that he obtained his information from at least five sources in China and overseas. \n \n Both monks immolated themselves at 10 a.m. local time (0200GMT) on Monday, he said. \n \n The two monks suffered slight burns and were in stable condition, state news agency Xinhua said, citing doctors. The report added that \"the suicide attempt is under further investigation.\" \n \n When asked about the self-immolations, Hu Jiang, an official from the Aba prefecture information office, told Reuters: \"I don't know anything about it, I'm not quite clear.\" \n \n Calls to the police bureau in Aba prefecture went unanswered. \n \n A Tibetan monk, Kanyag Tsering, from the sister Kirti monastery in the Indian town of Dharamsala, where Tibet's government-in-exile is based, said he had received confirmation that the Chinese military removed the bodies of the two monks. \n \n Tsering said he got his information from at least 10 different people inside the monastery and within Aba, including eyewitness accounts of the self-immolations. \n \n Tsering said the two monks were heard shouting several slogans as they burned themselves, including: \"Long live the Dalai Lama\". \n \n The self-immolations come just six months after another Tibetan Buddhist monk, Phuntsog, 21, from the same monastery, burned himself to death. Kelsang is related to Phuntsog. \n \n China last month jailed three monks for their involvement in Phuntsog's self-immolation. \n \n His death kicked off a harsh crackdown, with security forces detaining about 300 Tibetan monks for a month. \n \n Monks from the Kirti monastery also participated in protests that gripped Tibet and Tibetan areas of China in March 2008, when Buddhist monks and other Tibetan loyal to their exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama confronted police and troops. \n \n Beijing has repeatedly accused the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Dalai Lama of being a separatist who supports violence, charges he denies. \n \n The Dalai Lama and China have argued lately about what should happen when he dies. Beijing says he has to reincarnate, but the Dalai Lama has questioned whether this tradition should continue. \n \n \"Like a has-been star, he fears the loss of popularity,\" the official Xinhua news agency wrote in a commentary. \"In pursuit of fame and power, he has deviated from the commandments of Buddhism and used his religion as a subterfuge for his personal political motives.\" \n \n \"The Dalai Lama ... should seriously follow the teachings of Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, and seek the dharma that will liberate him from the rotation of life and death,\" it added. \n \n (Additional reporting by Sabrina Mao, Editing by Ben Blanchard and Sugita Katyal) ||||| Successor chosen by Dalai Lama 'illegal': China \n \n BEIJING \u2014 China said Monday any successor chosen by the Dalai Lama would be \"illegal\" after the Tibetan spiritual leader announced that he, and not Beijing, would decide whether he should be reincarnated. \n \n The Dalai Lama, who is 76, said on Saturday he would decide when he was \"about 90\" whether he should be reincarnated, in consultation with other monks, and that China should have no say in the matter. \n \n Under Tibetan tradition, monks identify a young boy who shows signs he is a reincarnation of a late leader, but many predict China will simply appoint its own successor to the Dalai Lama. \n \n China's foreign ministry said any reincarnation process would have to be conducted in accordance with the country's \"laws and regulation\". \n \n \"The title of Dalai Lama is conferred by the central government and is illegal otherwise,\" ministry spokesman Hong Lei told journalists. \n \n \"There is a complete set of religious rituals and historical conventions in reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and a Dalai Lama identifying his own successor has never been the practice. \n \n \"The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama should follow religious rituals and historical conventions and laws and regulations of this state.\" \n \n Tibet's spiritual leader said he had decided to lay out \"clear guidelines to recognise the next Dalai Lama\" while he was still \"physically and mentally fit\" so that there was \"no room for doubt or deception.\" \n \n The Dalai Lama made the statement in a 4,200-word document issued after a gathering of leaders of the four schools of Tibetan Buddhism in the northern Indian hill town of Dharamshala, home of the government in exile. \n \n He had earlier signalled a willingness to break with custom by choosing a successor before his death or among exiles outside Tibet. He had also said he might be open to electing the next Dalai Lama. \n \n China's stance raises the prospect of two Dalai Lamas -- one recognised by Beijing and the other chosen by exiles or with the blessing of the current Dalai Lama. \n \n This happened in 1995, when China rejected the Dalai Lama's choice to be the next Panchen Lama, the second-highest ranking Tibetan Buddhist, and picked its own reincarnation. \n \n The Chinese-raised Panchen Lama, Gyaincain Norbu, is now 21 and often extols Beijing's rule over Tibet. The Dalai Lama's selection, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, has not been seen since 1995 after he was detained by China. \n \n The Dalai Lama fled Tibet following a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. He later founded the government in exile in Dharamshala after being offered refuge by India. \n \n China vilifies him as a \"separatist\" who incites violence in Tibet, while he insists his sole focus is a peaceful campaign for greater autonomy for his homeland. \n \n China's state news agency Xinhua echoed the ministry's statements, calling the spiritual leader a \"has-been\" and saying his latest comments were aimed at keeping him in the spotlight following his retirement from politics. \n \n \"Over the decades since he fled China in 1959, the Dalai Lama has come to enjoy his role as a political monk, travelling across the globe, picking up his accolades and selling his independence claim,\" it said. \n \n \"Like a has-been star, he fears the loss of popularity, a personal loss that does no harm to his fellow Tibetans, but would certainly announce the eventual failure of his separatist attempt.\" \n \n Copyright \u00a9 2012 AFP.

    "document": "On Thursday, one of the men involved in the Schoolcraft County triple homicide case was sentenced. \n \n Garry Cordell, 47, was sentenced to life in prison without parole. Cordell listened as the family of Jody Hutchinson, Carrie Nelson, and Heather Aldrich spoke at his sentencing asking for the maximum sentence. \n \n \"How much compassion did you have when you murdered Carrie Heather and Jody?\" asked Kim Morrison, aunt of Carrie and Heather. \"My family has seen nothing of that in you and that's okay, your time will come. You have one more person to face and that is God.\" \n \n \"You gave my son, my children's brother and my grandchildren's father no mercy, I beg the court to give you none,\" said Linda Cole, Jody's mother. \n \n Cordell pleaded guilty to two counts of murder in the first degree and one count of felony murder last week and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The bodies of Hutchinson, Nelson and Aldrich were discovered in a burned car in Doyle Township in April. \n \n The second suspect Kenneth Brunke pleaded guilty in October to obstruction of justice and lying to a police officer in exchange for his testimony against Cordell and the late Marietta Carlson who died of natural causes while in custody. Cordell spoke up saying he did what he had to do. \n \n \"I didn't do this to hurt their family; no way ever will I ask for forgiveness,\" said Cordell. \"I'm proud of who I am and what I did and what I stand for.\" \n \n The prosecuting attorney shared a video with photographs of the victims and the burned car lasting four minutes, which is how long research shows it takes to strangle someone like Cordell did three times. \n \n \"I've never been an advocate of the death sentence, but in this particular instance I would probably find an exception if this were a different state,\" said Judge William Carmody. \n \n \"We are happy today even though we have tears in our eyes that justice has been done with Mr. Cordell, and hopefully the same can happen to Mr. Brunke,\" said Kellie Roll, mother of Carrie and Heather. \n \n The second suspect Kenneth Brunke will be sentenced on December 10th in Schoolcraft County Circuit Court. \n \n ||||| Share This Story Tweet Share Share Pin Email \n \n MANISTIQUE \u2014 The trees were just beginning to bud the night they dumped the bodies. The long, gravel road in the woods near the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula was muddy with an April thaw, causing deep ruts. The killers worried they were leaving tire tracks. \n \n The 2000 Oldsmobile Bravada was almost too small to handle its cargo \u2014 a dead man and dead woman in the back seat, another woman's body wedged behind that seat. Plus two 10-gallon cans of gasoline and a box of road flares. \n \n The explosion lit up the dark sky, the killers would later recall. But there was no one to see it except them. \n \n The early morning sun illuminates the historic water tower in Manistique in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, on Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015. \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n The SUV and the bodies were still smoldering the next afternoon when a local family came upon it while out for a drive and called police. \n \n The victims, authorities were able to determine, were two local sisters and the older sister's boyfriend. \n \n Within days, three Manistique area residents were arrested and charged with murder. \n \n At the heart of the killings was a tale of drugs, sex and betrayal. \n \n The case seemed solid. Police had confessions from two of the suspects, who both named the third as the mastermind behind the killings \n \n But within months, the story of what happened that April night would take a dramatic turn, after one of the suspects died in jail, and a new confession emerged. And a young, inexperienced prosecutor would face allegations that he mishandled the case after he cut a plea deal with one of the remaining defendants, a move that outraged the victims' families. \n \n 'Everybody is mad up here' \n \n Cast of Characters Defendants Kenneth Brunke, 46, was born and raised in LaGrange, Illinois, and moved to Manistique in 2011, where he worked for the Schoolcraft County Road Commission. He was divorced and the father of two. Investigators believe Brunke, known as \"Spark\" on the street was trafficking heavily in drugs in the region, supplying cocaine and morphine to street level dealers. In some statements, his co-defendants identified him as the mastermind behind the three murders, saying he was angry that one of the victims, Heather Aldrich, was spurning his affection, and had stolen drugs from him. The other two victims were killed, police say, because they provided Aldrich a lift to Brunke's house that day. Garry Cordell, 47, of Manistique, served ten years in prison after pleading guilty to a burglary charge, and was released in 2011. A self-proclaimed member of the Aryan Brotherhood, he has a dozen tattoos, including one of a human head on fire, and a melting face. He was living with his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, a few houses down from Brunke at the time of the killings, and began selling drugs for Brunke shortly after they met, likely sometime in 2014, according to court records. Cordell initially said Brunke helped kill two of the victims in the basement, but months later, changed his story and said Brunke was not at home when the killings occurred, and that he, Cordell, angry that one of the victims had been stealing drugs, killed them with the help of Carlson. Marietta Carlson, 28, of Manistique, was born there and graduated from Manistique High School with good grades. She began using drugs in her late teens, and depended upon Cordell for her cocaine and morphine. Carlson told several different versions of what happened in the house, but admitted to holding down Aldrich while she was strangled. Carlson died of a heart ailment while in custody of the Schoolcraft County jail. Since her statements were not under oath, and she was not subject to cross examination, they could not be used against the co-defendants. Murder Victims Heather Aldrich, 25, of Germfask, had five children. A high school dropout, she had completed her GED. She had a long history of drug abuse. Two months before her murder, she was arrested in a drug and prostitution ring in Gould City. She had a prior drug arrest in 2011 in Newberry. Police say Brunke, angry that she had stolen drugs from him, and furious that she was spurning his affection and posting on Facebook that she was seeing another man, lured her to his house that day with promises of free morphine. Jody Hutchinson, 42, lived in nearby Gould City. A life time resident of the Upper Peninsula, he worked intermittently in construction and auto repair. He was married, and the father of five children, and had two grandchildren. He was separated from his wife, and living with Carrie Ann Nelson. Aldrich's sister. He was arrested for cocaine possession in 2009, and served 166 days in jail. He was discharged from parole in 2011. He and Nelson gave Aldrich a ride to Brunke's house that day, a favor that cost them their lives. Carrie Ann Nelson, 31, lived in Gould City. She had two children, and a drug arrest in 2011. Police believe she and Aldrich went into Brunke's house first, while Hutchinson waited outside in his vehicle. Hutchinson eventually went into the house to investigate. Cordell would later tell police he taped a plastic bag over Hutchinson\u2019s face, then watched him suffocate. The Prosecutor Tim Noble, 39, was out of law school just a few months when he was appointed Schoolcraft County Prosecutor in 2011. He was unopposed, and elected to the seat that year. He has never tried a murder case, but says he relied on more experienced, fellow prosecutors in the state for advice on the triple homicide. Noble agreed to let Brunke plead to drastically reduced charges of lying to police and obstruction of justice in exchange for his testimony against Cordell, a plea deal that greatly angered the victim's families. \n \n The killings horrified residents in this remote, pristine community on the shores of Lake Michigan in the Upper Peninsula. \n \n Schoolcraft County, population 8,100, is known for its superb hunting and fishing, its blue lakes and long snow mobile trails. It's a place where people from big cities spend quiet summer vacations and families move for a simpler life. Its largest city is Manistique, a tiny town of 3,010, without a Walmart or a McDonald's. The nearest traffic light is more than 50 miles away. \n \n As details of the killings began to leak out, the initial shock turned into outrage. One of the victims was smothered with a plastic bag taped over his head, his hands tied behind his back, as his killer smoked cocaine and watched him die. The two sisters were shot up with drugs before being strangled, a kind of \"last meal\" for the condemned, the same killer would later brag. \n \n \"I was shocked,\" said Michigan State Police Lt. Tim Sholander, one of the investigators. \n \n Sholander, who grew up in Schoolcraft County and heads a drug task force based in Marquette, has seen his fair share of crime, but nothing like this. While there has been a sharp increase in drug use in the tiny towns of the UP in recent years, he said, this was a new level of violence. \n \n \"It shows the mind-set of the people involved.\" \n \n The police investigation, several hundred pages long, paints a picture of desperate lives \u2014 even among the splendor of a national forest and relative peace of a small, sleepy town -- of drug addicts living from one fix to the next, and dealers willing to kill if crossed. This report is based on those records, along with court documents and interviews. \n \n If the killings brought into focus the growing drug problem in this quiet community, it also put its young prosecutor on the hot seat and is now threatening his fledgling career. \n \n Timothy Noble, 39, is an affable man with an easy smile. A former Manistique City Council member, and the father of five, Noble was appointed as the Schoolcraft County prosecutor in 2011, just months out of law school, then elected unopposed to a four-year term. \n \n Schoolcraft County Prosecutor Timothy Noble listens to testimony during a court hearing on Monday, Oct. 19, 2015. \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n A one-man office, Noble has never tried a murder case, and has declined to comment on the case, saying there are matters pending.. And he has declined to discuss his decision to allow one of the accused killers to plead to a much lesser crime -- amid growing criticism in a town where some think he was too green to tackle the most violent crime in the county's history. \n \n Noble could have sought help from the MIchigan Attorney General's Office, which sends in seasoned trial attorneys to help prosecute complicated or violent crimes in rural counties with limited resources. \n \n \"We routinely provide advice and assistance to local prosecutors whenever they request such help,\" said Andrea Bitely, communications director for Attorney General Bill Schuette, in an email to the Free Press. \"We very frequently take over difficult and complex cases whenever the local prosecutor asks for our assistance. We are also glad to partner with the local prosecutor on complex and difficult cases when they ask. We have several veteran prosecutors who have a great deal of experience on difficult homicide, sexual assault and other specialized cases.\" \n \n \"To the best of our knowledge, there was no formal request for assistance from Schoolcraft County...\" she said. \n \n Noble's decision to handle the case on his own infuriated the victims' families. \n \n \"He doesn't know what he's doing,\" said Rob Hutchinson, brother of the man smothered with the plastic bag. \"Everybody is real mad up here.\" \n \n CLOSE Mantique area residents in Michigan\u2019s UP are shocked by the murders of three local residents, Jody Hutchinson, 42, Carrie Nelson, 31 ,and Heather Aldrich, 25. Victim\u2019s family members continue to seek justice. Kathleen Galligan Detroit Free Press \n \n A quiet but menacing man \n \n Kenneth Brunke was a loner, divorced, with a history of depression and suicide threats, when he moved to Manistique from Illinois sometime in 2011. The 46-year-old lived alone in a large, rambling tri-level home on rural Kendall Road and worked as a seasonal employee for the Schoolcraft Road Commission. \n \n Kenneth Brunke, 46, appears in court on Monday, Oct. 19, 2015. \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n His real money, police say, came from drug sales, with Brunke operating a narcotics ring that supplied local residents with cocaine and morphine. He was a quiet but menacing man, witnesses would later tell police, a man who kept an arsenal of guns, and made it known that he would not be crossed. \n \n \"I know what kind of guy this is, I know he's got a lot of guns in his house,\" one witness told police in the days after the killing as they began to focus their investigation on him. \"When you go over there, you should make sure your bases are covered.\" \n \n Sometime in early spring, Brunke heard about a young woman in nearby Germfask Township. Heather Aldrich, 25, was vivacious and pretty, a woman who had not lost her looks, despite 10 years of drug addiction. While she had used heroin, marijuana and alcohol, her drug of choice that March and April were morphine and cocaine. Brunke had plenty of that on hand. He put out the word he'd like to meet her. \n \n There had been stretches when Aldrich thought she was going to make it. Hooked on drugs in her early teens in rural Newberry by a boyfriend who introduced her to the needle, she dropped out of school and began to have babies, five in all. \n \n But along the way, she got her GED and, for a while, held a job at a local casino. She signed up for online university courses. \n \n Her Facebook page shows a yearning for a life without drugs, big plans to move downstate, a young woman, excited on a Saturday night to be dressed up and going out on the town. She hoped someday to see her children again, all whom were adopted out to other families. \n \n Kellie Roll of Germfask holds family photos of her daughters Carrie Nelson, 31, and Heather Aldrich, 25, who were murdered in mid April, along with Nelson's boyfriend Jody Hutchinson, 42. \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n But she always came back to the needle. \n \n \"She would come home to me, sometimes, mostly to rest,\" said her mother Kellie Roll, 51, at her small home in Germfask Township. \"I would fix her something to eat, and she'd stay awhile, but then she'd be gone,\" Roll said. \"Look, my daughter was an addict. It was a sickness.\" \n \n Brunke's neighbor, and the man selling Brunke's drugs on the street for him, Garry Cordell, a 46-year-old ex-con and addict himself, knew Aldrich and introduced her to Brunke. \n \n Brunke, socially awkward, was immediately smitten by the woman with the long hair. And Aldrich, who sometimes slept in her car, or at a cheap motel where she traded sex for money, suddenly found herself with a free supply of drugs and a place to stay. \n \n The relationship was strained from the beginning, with Brunke anxious for it to develop into something \"romantic.\" But Aldrich would disappear for days at a time, only to return for more drugs. Brunke was growing frustrated. \n \n And there was growing tension from another source. \n \n Cordell, who was at Brunke's house almost daily, would later tell police he was not happy that Brunke, whom he referred to as \"my dude,\" had fallen for Aldrich and was keeping her supplied with free drugs. \n \n \u201cHe saw that on Facebook, and he was f-----g madder than f---.\u201d Gary Cordell talking about Kenneth Brunke \n \n \"I encouraged him not to have Heather at his house, to only treat her the way she wants to be treated, but he never took my advice and let her come to his house and they began to see each other on a regular basis,\" Cordell would later say. \n \n Brunke grew even more upset when Cordell pointed out a new Facebook posting by Aldrich, announcing she was involved with another man. \n \n \"He saw that on Facebook, and he was f-----g madder than f---,\" Cordell would later tell police. \n \n The jealousy grew. Aldrich would later tell a friend that one day in early April she came home and found Brunke with a handgun to his head. He then pointed it at her and she left the room. \n \n But she stayed for the drugs. \n \n On April 14, Brunke had given her a large quantity of cocaine, and she drove out to River Road, a rural county gravel lane surrounded by forest, with a male friend to share it. As they sat shooting up, Brunke happened by in Schoolcraft Road Commission truck and glared at them. Aldrich's friend would later tell police he was certain Brunke had seen what they had been doing. \n \n The next day Aldrich, stopped by Brunke's house while he was at work for the road commission, and discovered he had hidden a large stash of cocaine in a PVC pipe buried in his backyard. The pipe was barely concealed beneath pine needles and Aldrich spotted it immediately. She drove back out to the spot on River Road with two friends, and shot up the drugs. \n \n Within hours, Brunke was texting her with a tantalizing message - there is free morphine on my computer desk, come by and get it. \"It sounds like he was baiting her to be honest with you,\" said one of her friends with her when the text came through.. \n \n Aldrich, panicked about stealing the drugs, and coming down from her high, hid her car at a nearby casino, worried Brunke was looking for her. And she called her sister, Carrie Nelson, 31, and Nelson's boyfriend, Jody Hutchinson, 42, and they all eventually met up in Germfask, at Aldrich's mother's house. \n \n Above: Heather Aldrich, 25; Carrie Nelson, 31, and Jody Hutchinson, 42 \n \n \"She told me she'd taken the drugs, and I said, 'Give them back,'\" Kellie Roll recalled her conversation with her youngest daughter.\"But she was scared.\" \n \n On April 16, she woke that morning and found that the temptation of free morphine was too great. \n \n Before she hitched a ride with her sister Nelson and Nelson's boyfriend Hutchinson to Brunke's house for the free drugs, Aldrich posted on her Facebook Page a song about the struggles of addiction. \n \n \"The needle in my arm, \n \n The thoughts in my head, \n \n What's the matter anyway, \n \n By morning I'll be dead.\" \n \n It would prove an eerie premonition. \n \n A gruesome discovery \n \n The burned Bravada containing the bodies of tripple homicide victims Heather Aldrich, Carrie Nelson and Jodi Hutchinson lies in the traffic lane of River Road just outside Manistique in mid April 2015. \n \n (Photo: Michigan State Police) \n \n The next day -- April 17 -- in the late afternoon, a Manistique couple and their two sons, 8 and 14, were driving on River Road near where Aldrich and her friends had been shooting up the stolen cocaine a few days before and saw an SUV stopped in the middle of the muddy icy road. As they got closer, they could see that it had been burned. One small wisp of smoke rose through the air. \n \n The four piled out to investigate, peered into the windows and saw what appeared to be two smoldering bodies in the back seat. They fled back to their car and the shaken father dialed 911. \n \n Police arrived and were able to determine there were three bodies in the Oldsmobile Bravado, two in the back seat and one in the cargo area. \n \n The fire had been so fierce it melted the tires off the vehicle. The blackened bodies were still warm and smoking. \n \n The victims were identified as Aldrich, her sister Nelson, and Nelson's boyfriend, Hutchinson. Because of the condition of the bodies, the medical examiner could not determine the cause of death. \n \n Within days of the bodies being discovered, a witness told police she had been with Garry Cordell, Brunke's drug salesman and neighbor, when he threw items belonging to the victims in the Manistique River. \n \n Cordell and his live-in girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, 27, also an addict, were arrested a few days later and both gave detailed confessions, admitting to the killings and implicating Brunke, saying he helped strangle and smother the victims in his own home. \n \n The motive - to punish Aldrich for the theft of the cocaine. \n \n Nelson and Hutchinson had been killed because they'd given Aldrich a ride to Brunke's house and were witnesses. \n \n A few days later, Brunke was arrested in Illinois where he had fled after the killings. While he was in Illinois, investigators said, Brunke replaced the four tires on his car, worried police might match the tires to the ruts found near the smoking SUV. \n \n Conflicting stories \n \n In the beginning, the three defendants told shifting stories of what happened that night. But all agreed that Brunke had lured Aldrich to his house with the promise of free drugs. \n \n Garry Cordell, 47, during a court appearance on Monday, Oct. 19, 2015. \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n Carlson insisted at first that Brunke had strangled Aldrich in his bedroom, while she held Aldrich's legs to keep her from kicking and flailing. She later said it was Cordell, who strangled Aldrich, under orders from Brunke, who couldn't do it himself but wanted her dead because of the theft of the drugs and her Facebook posting about another man. Meanwhile, Brunke, she said, was killing the other two victims, who were tied up in the basement. \n \n Cordell, in a lengthy interview shortly after his arrest, told police that Brunke admitted killing Nelson in the basement, strangling her as she was tied to a pole. Cordell said he was upstairs at the time, but that Brunke provided specific details of his own murderous activity in the basement. \"He said it took less than two minutes,\" to kill Carrie Nelson, Cordell told police. \n \n Brunke, in custody, was interviewed only once by police before he hired an attorney. He admitted that he had been angry that Aldrich, with whom he had been having a relationship, was seeing another man. \n \n \"I was upset,\" he told investigators, \"I didn't sleep that night. Someone that I cared about, you know, basically stabbing me.\" \n \n All three suspects were charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to murder, and kidnapping since the victims had been held against their will in Brunke's home.But he denied that anybody had been harmed in his house, and insisted that he had nothing to do with the killings. \"All I know is when those people left my house, they were vertical, they were fine.\" \n \n Grieving family members braced for a trial. There were plenty. Carrie Nelson had two young sons. Heather, in addition to her five children, had a mother, step father, and brother, Zach. Jody Hutchinson had 5 children, two grandchildren, a mother and four siblings. They were all confident that the numerous statements made by the defendants would ensure convictions. \n \n They would be deeply disappointed. \n \n A jailhouse death and new confession \n \n Marietta Carlson had been in the Schoolcraft County jail for 47 days, awaiting trial on three counts in the murders of Heather Aldrich, Carrie Nelson and Jody Hutchinson, when she woke up June 16, and complained of stomach pain. After a jail nurse examined her, she was taken to Schoolcraft Memorial Hospital. \n \n Marietta Carlson's booking photo. \n \n (Photo: Schoolcraft Sheriff's Dept.) \n \n Doctors initially thought she had gallbladder problems, but as her condition deteriorated, they prepared to send her by helicopter to a hospital in Marquette. She never got on the helicopter and died early the next day. An autopsy found that she had an inflamed heart, possibly because of 10 years of drug abuse. \n \n Her statements to police about what happened in Brunke's house the night of April 16 had been crucial to the prosecutor's case. But they were inadmissible in court, since they were not under oath, and she could not be cross examined. \n \n So now the prosecutor was down to two defendants, but with enough evidence to proceed to trial. \n \n The two men were being held in separate jails, Cordell in Schoolcraft County Jail, and Brunke in Chippewa County jail. Both men began to explore insanity defenses and after their attorneys filed motions, were ordered to undergo psychological exams at the state's Forensic Center.

In what was to be his fifth confession to police, he now said Brunke was not in the house at the time of the killings, and that he and Carlson had committed the murders. \n \n He said the two women arrived at the house, looking for morphine, and that he forced the two women into the basement at gunpoint as Hutchinson waited outside in the car. He tied the women up, then invited Hutchinson in. In the basement, Hutchinson pulled a small knife and Cordell disarmed him, then tied him up. \n \n A small memorial stands in front of Kenneth Brunke's home outside of Manistique where police say the three victims were strangled and suffocated. \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n \"Jody was the first person to die,\" Cordell said in his written statement, dated Sept. 29. \"I placed a bag over his head and duct taped it around his neck at which time he told me he couldn't breathe, and I said, 'no kidding, dummy.' \" \n \n He then strangled Nelson, he said. Carlson choked Aldrich to death. \n \n Brunke arrived home from work a short time later, Cordell said. \"Once talking to me and finding out that I killed all three of them and that we need to get rid of them, he is really mad at me\u2026\" Cordell said in his statement. \n \n His reason for the triple homicide? His dismay at Alrldich's theft of the drugs from his friend Brunke, and his suspicion that all three victims were working with undercover drug enforcement officers, a claim law enforcement dismissed as ludicrous. \n \n Cordell continued. The three loaded up the bodies into Hutchinson's SUV, then Brunke drove it into the forest, with Carlson and Cordell following in Brunke's car. Once far enough off the main roads, they stopped and doused the SUV with gasoline. Brunke, Cordell said, threw a flare into the car \"and it exploded into flames.\" \n \n 'One man shall die so that the other may live' \n \n Autumn Arseneau, 18, Zak Roll, 18, and his mother Kellie Roll, 51, of Germfask, listen to testimony about the murders of Arseneau's uncle Jody Hutchinson, 42, and Roll's daughters Carrie Nelson, 31, and Heather Aldrich, 25, during an Oct. 19 court hearing. \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n The prosecutor, who has declined to discuss the case with the Free Press, called all the victims' family members together in early October to say he didn't think he could make the murder charges stick against Brunke without Marietta Carlson's statements and in light of Cordell's new confession. The murder charges against Brunke were being dropped and he was going to be allowed to plead to obstruction of justice and lying to a police officer, convictions that could have him out of prison in five years or less. In exchange, he was going to testify against Cordell. \n \n \"We were all crying,\" Kellie Roll recalled about the meeting in September. \"There was all that evidence. It just didn't make sense.\" \n \n Some people, including the victims' families, believe Cordell took the fall for Brunke in exchange for cash, or a promise by Brunke to take care of Cordell's elderly mother once Brunke is released from prison in a few years. \n \n Indeed, there is some evidence money Brunke, or someone acting on his behalf, got money to Cordell after Cordell's last confession, exonerating Brunke. \n \n On Oct. 19, moments before Brunke was brought into court to testify against Cordell at Cordell's preliminary exam, the prosecutor heard from a source that Brunke owed Cordell $6,500. When Brunke took the stand Noble asked him about it. Brunke seemed caught off guard by the question, then admitted he owed Cordell the money, but was vague about why, saying Cordell had done chores around his house, including landscaping.It was a peculiar answer, since Brunke's rural home sits on a large lot, unkempt with no sign of landscaping at all. Reporters from the Free Press walked the 3-acre lot in October. \n \n It was also odd because multiple witnesses in the investigation told police that Cordell, unemployed and indigent, often owed money to Brunke, an employed homeowner, and not the other way around. \n \n The debt had been paid by the time Cordell was back in court three weeks later to officially plead guilty to the three murders. When the prosecutor in court asked whether Brunke still owed him money, Cordell said \"not anymore.\" \n \n The prosecutor continued. \"What did Mr. Brunke owe you money for?\" \n \n Cordell responded, \"I don't think that's any of your business.\" \n \n And then he added, with a slight grin, \"One man shall die so that the other may live.\" \n \n Unresolved questions \n \n Brunke will be in court Jan. 21 when he will be sentenced to prison on the lesser felonies. \n \n According to his October testimony, he arrived home that day to find Cordell and Carlson in his home with the three dead bodies. He said he was in fear of his life, and helped dispose of the bodies in the woods. When asked by the prosecutor why he lied to police, he said, \"Because I thought I could get away with something at that point.\" \n \n \u201cHow is that they can say this guy wasn't involved? There's something going on here. We're not getting the whole picture.\u201d Ken, a Manistique resident \n \n The prosecutor then asked, \"Did you think you had done something criminal at that point?\" And Brunke said \"I didn't know but I wanted nothing to do with what happened.\" \n \n Once facing life in prison, he will likely do less than five years, under sentencing guidelines. \n \n The community was both mesmerized and suspicious about how the case unfolded. \n \n \"It's torn this town apart,\" said Ken, who was drinking at Marley's, a tavern in downtown Manistique, with his friend Dan, and discussing the murders one night in October. \n \n They asked that their last names not be used, worried about antagonizing the prosecutor in this small town, where everybody knows everybody, but also leery of angering any friends Brunke and Cordell might still have in the drug community. \n \n The killings have been the topic du jour at this longtime bar and grill, known for the homemade buns on the hamburgers. The consensus, said Ken, is that Brunke got the deal of a lifetime. \n \n A makeshift memorial stands in honor of Jody Hutchinson, 42, and sisters Carrie Nelson, 31, and Heather Aldrich, 25, at the side on River Road in Doyle Township where their bodies were burned in an SUV.. \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n \"How is that they can say this guy wasn't involved? There's something going on here,\" he said. \"We're not getting the whole picture.\" \n \n Out on River Road, where the bodies were burned, the trees are now bare in the late autumn light. It's been eight months since the killings. There is still a faint stain of soot on the road, now almost washed away by rain. \n \n Not long after the killings, the victims' families and friends put up a makeshift memorial at the site, with small crosses and stuffed animals, and balloons, now-deflated. The crosses read, \"mother,\" \"sister,\" \"daughter,\" \"dad.\" \n \n But within days of Cordell's sentencing in November, someone smashed the little shrine, breaking the crosses and destroying the mementos. \n \n \"It was where we could all go to remember them,\" said Kellie Roll. \"And now that's gone too.\" \n \n And they are still faced with one haunting question: \n \n Did someone get away with murder that day? ||||| Share This Story Tweet Share Share Pin Email \n \n MANISTIQUE \u2014 The trees were just beginning to bud the night they dumped the bodies. The long, gravel road in the woods near the Hiawatha National Forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula was muddy with an April thaw, causing deep ruts. The killers worried they were leaving tire tracks. \n \n The 2000 Oldsmobile Bravada was almost too small to handle its cargo \u2014 a dead man and dead woman in the back seat, another woman's body wedged behind that seat. Plus two 10-gallon cans of gasoline and a box of road flares. \n \n The explosion lit up the dark sky, the killers would later recall. But there was no one to see it except them. \n \n \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n The SUV and the bodies were still smoldering the next afternoon when a local family came upon it while out for a drive and called police. \n \n The victims, authorities were able to determine, were two local sisters and the older sister's boyfriend. \n \n Within days, three Manistique area residents were arrested and charged with murder. \n \n At the heart of the killings was a tale of drugs, sex and betrayal. \n \n The case seemed solid. Police had confessions from two of the suspects, who both named the third as the mastermind behind the killings \n \n But within months, the story of what happened that April night would take a dramatic turn, after one of the suspects died in jail, and a new confession emerged. And a young, inexperienced prosecutor would face allegations that he mishandled the case after he cut a plea deal with one of the remaining defendants, a move that outraged the victims' families. \n \n 'Everybody is mad up here' \n \n Cast of Characters Defendants Kenneth Brunke, 46, was born and raised in LaGrange, Illinois, and moved to Manistique in 2011, where he worked for the Schoolcraft County Road Commission. He was divorced and the father of two. Investigators believe Brunke, known as \"Spark\" on the street was trafficking heavily in drugs in the region, supplying cocaine and morphine to street level dealers. In some statements, his co-defendants identified him as the mastermind behind the three murders, saying he was angry that one of the victims, Heather Aldrich, was spurning his affection, and had stolen drugs from him. The other two victims were killed, police say, because they provided Aldrich a lift to Brunke's house that day. Garry Cordell, 47, of Manistique, served ten years in prison after pleading guilty to a burglary charge, and was released in 2011. A self-proclaimed member of the Aryan Brotherhood, he has a dozen tattoos, including one of a human head on fire, and a melting face. He was living with his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, a few houses down from Brunke at the time of the killings, and began selling drugs for Brunke shortly after they met, likely sometime in 2014, according to court records. Cordell initially said Brunke helped kill two of the victims in the basement, but months later, changed his story and said Brunke was not at home when the killings occurred, and that he, Cordell, angry that one of the victims had been stealing drugs, killed them with the help of Carlson. Marietta Carlson, 28, of Manistique, was born there and graduated from Manistique High School with good grades. She began using drugs in her late teens, and depended upon Cordell for her cocaine and morphine. Carlson told several different versions of what happened in the house, but admitted to holding down Aldrich while she was strangled. Carlson died of a heart ailment while in custody of the Schoolcraft County jail. Since her statements were not under oath, and she was not subject to cross examination, they could not be used against the co-defendants. Murder Victims Heather Aldrich, 25, of Germfask, had five children. A high school dropout, she had completed her GED. She had a long history of drug abuse. Two months before her murder, she was arrested in a drug and prostitution ring in Gould City. She had a prior drug arrest in 2011 in Newberry. Police say Brunke, angry that she had stolen drugs from him, and furious that she was spurning his affection and posting on Facebook that she was seeing another man, lured her to his house that day with promises of free morphine. Jody Hutchinson, 42, lived in nearby Gould City. A life time resident of the Upper Peninsula, he worked intermittently in construction and auto repair. He was married, and the father of five children, and had two grandchildren. He was separated from his wife, and living with Carrie Ann Nelson. Aldrich's sister. He was arrested for cocaine possession in 2009, and served 166 days in jail. He was discharged from parole in 2011. He and Nelson gave Aldrich a ride to Brunke's house that day, a favor that cost them their lives. Carrie Ann Nelson, 31, lived in Gould City. She had two children, and a drug arrest in 2011. Police believe she and Aldrich went into Brunke's house first, while Hutchinson waited outside in his vehicle. Hutchinson eventually went into the house to investigate. Cordell would later tell police he taped a plastic bag over Hutchinson\u2019s face, then watched him suffocate. The Prosecutor Tim Noble, 39, was out of law school just a few months when he was appointed Schoolcraft County Prosecutor in 2011. He was unopposed, and elected to the seat that year. He has never tried a murder case, but says he relied on more experienced, fellow prosecutors in the state for advice on the triple homicide. Noble agreed to let Brunke plead to drastically reduced charges of lying to police and obstruction of justice in exchange for his testimony against Cordell, a plea deal that greatly angered the victim's families. \n \n The killings horrified residents in this remote, pristine community on the shores of Lake Michigan in the Upper Peninsula. \n \n Schoolcraft County, population 8,100, is known for its superb hunting and fishing, its blue lakes and long snow mobile trails. It's a place where people from big cities spend quiet summer vacations and families move for a simpler life. Its largest city is Manistique, a tiny town of 3,010, without a Walmart or a McDonald's. The nearest traffic light is more than 50 miles away. \n \n As details of the killings began to leak out, the initial shock turned into outrage. One of the victims was smothered with a plastic bag taped over his head, his hands tied behind his back, as his killer smoked cocaine and watched him die. The two sisters were shot up with drugs before being strangled, a kind of \"last meal\" for the condemned, the same killer would later brag. \n \n \"I was shocked,\" said Michigan State Police Lt. Tim Sholander, one of the investigators. \n \n Sholander, who grew up in Schoolcraft County and heads a drug task force based in Marquette, has seen his fair share of crime, but nothing like this. While there has been a sharp increase in drug use in the tiny towns of the UP in recent years, he said, this was a new level of violence. \n \n \"It shows the mind-set of the people involved.\" \n \n The police investigation, several hundred pages long, paints a picture of desperate lives \u2014 even among the splendor of a national forest and relative peace of a small, sleepy town -- of drug addicts living from one fix to the next, and dealers willing to kill if crossed. This report is based on those records, along with court documents and interviews. \n \n If the killings brought into focus the growing drug problem in this quiet community, it also put its young prosecutor on the hot seat and is now threatening his fledgling career. \n \n Timothy Noble, 39, is an affable man with an easy smile. A former Manistique City Council member, and the father of five, Noble was appointed as the Schoolcraft County prosecutor in 2011, just months out of law school, then elected unopposed to a four-year term. \n \n \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n A one-man office, Noble has never tried a murder case, and has declined to comment on the case, saying there are matters pending.. And he has declined to discuss his decision to allow one of the accused killers to plead to a much lesser crime -- amid growing criticism in a town where some think he was too green to tackle the most violent crime in the county's history. \n \n Noble could have sought help from the MIchigan Attorney General's Office, which sends in seasoned trial attorneys to help prosecute complicated or violent crimes in rural counties with limited resources. \n \n \"We routinely provide advice and assistance to local prosecutors whenever they request such help,\" said Andrea Bitely, communications director for Attorney General Bill Schuette, in an email to the Free Press. \"We very frequently take over difficult and complex cases whenever the local prosecutor asks for our assistance. We are also glad to partner with the local prosecutor on complex and difficult cases when they ask. We have several veteran prosecutors who have a great deal of experience on difficult homicide, sexual assault and other specialized cases.\" \n \n \"To the best of our knowledge, there was no formal request for assistance from Schoolcraft County...\" she said. \n \n Noble's decision to handle the case on his own infuriated the victims' families. \n \n \"He doesn't know what he's doing,\" said Rob Hutchinson, brother of the man smothered with the plastic bag. \"Everybody is real mad up here.\" \n \n Skip in Skip x Embed x Share CLOSE Mantique area residents in Michigan\u2019s UP are shocked by the murders of three local residents, Jody Hutchinson, 42, Carrie Nelson, 31 ,and Heather Aldrich, 25. Victim\u2019s family members continue to seek justice. Kathleen Galligan Detroit Free Press \n \n A quiet but menacing man \n \n Kenneth Brunke was a loner, divorced, with a history of depression and suicide threats, when he moved to Manistique from Illinois sometime in 2011. The 46-year-old lived alone in a large, rambling tri-level home on rural Kendall Road and worked as a seasonal employee for the Schoolcraft Road Commission. \n \n \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n His real money, police say, came from drug sales, with Brunke operating a narcotics ring that supplied local residents with cocaine and morphine. He was a quiet but menacing man, witnesses would later tell police, a man who kept an arsenal of guns, and made it known that he would not be crossed. \n \n \"I know what kind of guy this is, I know he's got a lot of guns in his house,\" one witness told police in the days after the killing as they began to focus their investigation on him. \"When you go over there, you should make sure your bases are covered.\" \n \n Sometime in early spring, Brunke heard about a young woman in nearby Germfask Township. Heather Aldrich, 25, was vivacious and pretty, a woman who had not lost her looks, despite 10 years of drug addiction. While she had used heroin, marijuana and alcohol, her drug of choice that March and April were morphine and cocaine. Brunke had plenty of that on hand. He put out the word he'd like to meet her. \n \n There had been stretches when Aldrich thought she was going to make it. Hooked on drugs in her early teens in rural Newberry by a boyfriend who introduced her to the needle, she dropped out of school and began to have babies, five in all. \n \n But along the way, she got her GED and, for a while, held a job at a local casino. She signed up for online university courses. \n \n Her Facebook page shows a yearning for a life without drugs, big plans to move downstate, a young woman, excited on a Saturday night to be dressed up and going out on the town. She hoped someday to see her children again, all whom were adopted out to other families. \n \n \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n But she always came back to the needle. \n \n \"She would come home to me, sometimes, mostly to rest,\" said her mother Kellie Roll, 51, at her small home in Germfask Township. \"I would fix her something to eat, and she'd stay awhile, but then she'd be gone,\" Roll said. \"Look, my daughter was an addict. It was a sickness.\" \n \n Brunke's neighbor, and the man selling Brunke's drugs on the street for him, Garry Cordell, a 46-year-old ex-con and addict himself, knew Aldrich and introduced her to Brunke. \n \n Brunke, socially awkward, was immediately smitten by the woman with the long hair. And Aldrich, who sometimes slept in her car, or at a cheap motel where she traded sex for money, suddenly found herself with a free supply of drugs and a place to stay. \n \n The relationship was strained from the beginning, with Brunke anxious for it to develop into something \"romantic.\" But Aldrich would disappear for days at a time, only to return for more drugs. Brunke was growing frustrated. \n \n And there was growing tension from another source. \n \n Cordell, who was at Brunke's house almost daily, would later tell police he was not happy that Brunke, whom he referred to as \"my dude,\" had fallen for Aldrich and was keeping her supplied with free drugs. \n \n \u201cHe saw that on Facebook, and he was f-----g madder than f---.\u201d Gary Cordell talking about Kenneth Brunke \n \n \"I encouraged him not to have Heather at his house, to only treat her the way she wants to be treated, but he never took my advice and let her come to his house and they began to see each other on a regular basis,\" Cordell would later say. \n \n Brunke grew even more upset when Cordell pointed out a new Facebook posting by Aldrich, announcing she was involved with another man. \n \n \"He saw that on Facebook, and he was f-----g madder than f---,\" Cordell would later tell police. \n \n The jealousy grew. Aldrich would later tell a friend that one day in early April she came home and found Brunke with a handgun to his head. He then pointed it at her and she left the room. \n \n But she stayed for the drugs. \n \n On April 14, Brunke had given her a large quantity of cocaine, and she drove out to River Road, a rural county gravel lane surrounded by forest, with a male friend to share it. As they sat shooting up, Brunke happened by in Schoolcraft Road Commission truck and glared at them. Aldrich's friend would later tell police he was certain Brunke had seen what they had been doing. \n \n The next day Aldrich, stopped by Brunke's house while he was at work for the road commission, and discovered he had hidden a large stash of cocaine in a PVC pipe buried in his backyard. The pipe was barely concealed beneath pine needles and Aldrich spotted it immediately. She drove back out to the spot on River Road with two friends, and shot up the drugs. \n \n Within hours, Brunke was texting her with a tantalizing message - there is free morphine on my computer desk, come by and get it. \"It sounds like he was baiting her to be honest with you,\" said one of her friends with her when the text came through.. \n \n Aldrich, panicked about stealing the drugs, and coming down from her high, hid her car at a nearby casino, worried Brunke was looking for her. And she called her sister, Carrie Nelson, 31, and Nelson's boyfriend, Jody Hutchinson, 42, and they all eventually met up in Germfask, at Aldrich's mother's house. \n \n Above: Heather Aldrich, 25; Carrie Nelson, 31, and Jody Hutchinson, 42 \n \n \"She told me she'd taken the drugs, and I said, 'Give them back,'\" Kellie Roll recalled her conversation with her youngest daughter.\"But she was scared.\" \n \n On April 16, she woke that morning and found that the temptation of free morphine was too great. \n \n Before she hitched a ride with her sister Nelson and Nelson's boyfriend Hutchinson to Brunke's house for the free drugs, Aldrich posted on her Facebook Page a song about the struggles of addiction. \n \n \"The needle in my arm, \n \n The thoughts in my head, \n \n What's the matter anyway, \n \n By morning I'll be dead.\" \n \n It would prove an eerie premonition. \n \n A gruesome discovery \n \n \n \n (Photo: Michigan State Police) \n \n The next day -- April 17 -- in the late afternoon, a Manistique couple and their two sons, 8 and 14, were driving on River Road near where Aldrich and her friends had been shooting up the stolen cocaine a few days before and saw an SUV stopped in the middle of the muddy icy road. As they got closer, they could see that it had been burned. One small wisp of smoke rose through the air. \n \n The four piled out to investigate, peered into the windows and saw what appeared to be two smoldering bodies in the back seat. They fled back to their car and the shaken father dialed 911. \n \n Police arrived and were able to determine there were three bodies in the Oldsmobile Bravado, two in the back seat and one in the cargo area. \n \n The fire had been so fierce it melted the tires off the vehicle. The blackened bodies were still warm and smoking. \n \n The victims were identified as Aldrich, her sister Nelson, and Nelson's boyfriend, Hutchinson. Because of the condition of the bodies, the medical examiner could not determine the cause of death. \n \n Within days of the bodies being discovered, a witness told police she had been with Garry Cordell, Brunke's drug salesman and neighbor, when he threw items belonging to the victims in the Manistique River. \n \n Cordell and his live-in girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, 27, also an addict, were arrested a few days later and both gave detailed confessions, admitting to the killings and implicating Brunke, saying he helped strangle and smother the victims in his own home. \n \n The motive - to punish Aldrich for the theft of the cocaine. \n \n Nelson and Hutchinson had been killed because they'd given Aldrich a ride to Brunke's house and were witnesses. \n \n A few days later, Brunke was arrested in Illinois where he had fled after the killings. While he was in Illinois, investigators said, Brunke replaced the four tires on his car, worried police might match the tires to the ruts found near the smoking SUV. \n \n Conflicting stories \n \n In the beginning, the three defendants told shifting stories of what happened that night. But all agreed that Brunke had lured Aldrich to his house with the promise of free drugs. \n \n \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n Carlson insisted at first that Brunke had strangled Aldrich in his bedroom, while she held Aldrich's legs to keep her from kicking and flailing. She later said it was Cordell, who strangled Aldrich, under orders from Brunke, who couldn't do it himself but wanted her dead because of the theft of the drugs and her Facebook posting about another man. Meanwhile, Brunke, she said, was killing the other two victims, who were tied up in the basement. \n \n Cordell, in a lengthy interview shortly after his arrest, told police that Brunke admitted killing Nelson in the basement, strangling her as she was tied to a pole. Cordell said he was upstairs at the time, but that Brunke provided specific details of his own murderous activity in the basement. \"He said it took less than two minutes,\" to kill Carrie Nelson, Cordell told police. \n \n Brunke, in custody, was interviewed only once by police before he hired an attorney. He admitted that he had been angry that Aldrich, with whom he had been having a relationship, was seeing another man. \n \n \"I was upset,\" he told investigators, \"I didn't sleep that night. Someone that I cared about, you know, basically stabbing me.\" \n \n All three suspects were charged with first-degree murder, conspiracy to murder, and kidnapping since the victims had been held against their will in Brunke's home.But he denied that anybody had been harmed in his house, and insisted that he had nothing to do with the killings. \"All I know is when those people left my house, they were vertical, they were fine.\" \n \n Grieving family members braced for a trial. There were plenty. Carrie Nelson had two young sons. Heather, in addition to her five children, had a mother, step father, and brother, Zach. Jody Hutchinson had 5 children, two grandchildren, a mother and four siblings. They were all confident that the numerous statements made by the defendants would ensure convictions. \n \n They would be deeply disappointed. \n \n A jailhouse death and new confession \n \n Marietta Carlson had been in the Schoolcraft County jail for 47 days, awaiting trial on three counts in the murders of Heather Aldrich, Carrie Nelson and Jody Hutchinson, when she woke up June 16, and complained of stomach pain. After a jail nurse examined her, she was taken to Schoolcraft Memorial Hospital. \n \n \n \n (Photo: Schoolcraft Sheriff's Dept.) \n \n Doctors initially thought she had gallbladder problems, but as her condition deteriorated, they prepared to send her by helicopter to a hospital in Marquette. She never got on the helicopter and died early the next day. An autopsy found that she had an inflamed heart, possibly because of 10 years of drug abuse. \n \n Her statements to police about what happened in Brunke's house the night of April 16 had been crucial to the prosecutor's case. But they were inadmissible in court, since they were not under oath, and she could not be cross examined. \n \n So now the prosecutor was down to two defendants, but with enough evidence to proceed to trial. \n \n The two men were being held in separate jails, Cordell in Schoolcraft County Jail, and Brunke in Chippewa County jail. Both men began to explore insanity defenses and after their attorneys filed motions, were ordered to undergo psychological exams at the state's Forensic Center. Both ended up there on the same day Sept. 11. It's unclear from records whether their paths crossed while at the center. \n \n \u201cJody was the first person to die. I placed a bag over his head and duct taped it around his neck at which time he told me he couldn\u2019t breathe, and I said, \u2018no kidding, dummy.\u2019\u201d Garry Cordell's statement to police \n \n But three weeks later, Cordell, to the astonishment of investigators, suddenly changed his story. In what was to be his fifth confession to police, he now said Brunke was not in the house at the time of the killings, and that he and Carlson had committed the murders. \n \n He said the two women arrived at the house, looking for morphine, and that he forced the two women into the basement at gunpoint as Hutchinson waited outside in the car. He tied the women up, then invited Hutchinson in. In the basement, Hutchinson pulled a small knife and Cordell disarmed him, then tied him up. \n \n \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n \"Jody was the first person to die,\" Cordell said in his written statement, dated Sept. 29. \"I placed a bag over his head and duct taped it around his neck at which time he told me he couldn't breathe, and I said, 'no kidding, dummy.' \" \n \n He then strangled Nelson, he said. Carlson choked Aldrich to death. \n \n Brunke arrived home from work a short time later, Cordell said. \"Once talking to me and finding out that I killed all three of them and that we need to get rid of them, he is really mad at me\u2026\" Cordell said in his statement. \n \n His reason for the triple homicide? His dismay at Alrldich's theft of the drugs from his friend Brunke, and his suspicion that all three victims were working with undercover drug enforcement officers, a claim law enforcement dismissed as ludicrous. \n \n Cordell continued. The three loaded up the bodies into Hutchinson's SUV, then Brunke drove it into the forest, with Carlson and Cordell following in Brunke's car. Once far enough off the main roads, they stopped and doused the SUV with gasoline. Brunke, Cordell said, threw a flare into the car \"and it exploded into flames.\" \n \n 'One man shall die so that the other may live' \n \n \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n The prosecutor, who has declined to discuss the case with the Free Press, called all the victims' family members together in early October to say he didn't think he could make the murder charges stick against Brunke without Marietta Carlson's statements and in light of Cordell's new confession. The murder charges against Brunke were being dropped and he was going to be allowed to plead to obstruction of justice and lying to a police officer, convictions that could have him out of prison in five years or less. In exchange, he was going to testify against Cordell. \n \n \"We were all crying,\" Kellie Roll recalled about the meeting in September. \"There was all that evidence. It just didn't make sense.\" \n \n Some people, including the victims' families, believe Cordell took the fall for Brunke in exchange for cash, or a promise by Brunke to take care of Cordell's elderly mother once Brunke is released from prison in a few years. \n \n Indeed, there is some evidence money Brunke, or someone acting on his behalf, got money to Cordell after Cordell's last confession, exonerating Brunke. \n \n On Oct. 19, moments before Brunke was brought into court to testify against Cordell at Cordell's preliminary exam, the prosecutor heard from a source that Brunke owed Cordell $6,500. When Brunke took the stand Noble asked him about it. Brunke seemed caught off guard by the question, then admitted he owed Cordell the money, but was vague about why, saying Cordell had done chores around his house, including landscaping.It was a peculiar answer, since Brunke's rural home sits on a large lot, unkempt with no sign of landscaping at all. Reporters from the Free Press walked the 3-acre lot in October. \n \n It was also odd because multiple witnesses in the investigation told police that Cordell, unemployed and indigent, often owed money to Brunke, an employed homeowner, and not the other way around. \n \n The debt had been paid by the time Cordell was back in court three weeks later to officially plead guilty to the three murders. When the prosecutor in court asked whether Brunke still owed him money, Cordell said \"not anymore.\" \n \n The prosecutor continued. \"What did Mr. Brunke owe you money for?\" \n \n Cordell responded, \"I don't think that's any of your business.\" \n \n And then he added, with a slight grin, \"One man shall die so that the other may live.\" \n \n Unresolved questions \n \n Brunke will be in court Jan. 21 when he will be sentenced to prison on the lesser felonies. \n \n According to his October testimony, he arrived home that day to find Cordell and Carlson in his home with the three dead bodies. He said he was in fear of his life, and helped dispose of the bodies in the woods. When asked by the prosecutor why he lied to police, he said, \"Because I thought I could get away with something at that point.\" \n \n \u201cHow is that they can say this guy wasn't involved? There's something going on here. We're not getting the whole picture.\u201d Ken, a Manistique resident \n \n The prosecutor then asked, \"Did you think you had done something criminal at that point?\" And Brunke said \"I didn't know but I wanted nothing to do with what happened.\" \n \n Once facing life in prison, he will likely do less than five years, under sentencing guidelines. \n \n The community was both mesmerized and suspicious about how the case unfolded. \n \n \"It's torn this town apart,\" said Ken, who was drinking at Marley's, a tavern in downtown Manistique, with his friend Dan, and discussing the murders one night in October. \n \n They asked that their last names not be used, worried about antagonizing the prosecutor in this small town, where everybody knows everybody, but also leery of angering any friends Brunke and Cordell might still have in the drug community. \n \n The killings have been the topic du jour at this longtime bar and grill, known for the homemade buns on the hamburgers. The consensus, said Ken, is that Brunke got the deal of a lifetime. \n \n \n \n (Photo: Kathleen Galligan/Detroit Free Press) \n \n \"How is that they can say this guy wasn't involved? There's something going on here,\" he said. \"We're not getting the whole picture.\" \n \n Out on River Road, where the bodies were burned, the trees are now bare in the late autumn light. It's been eight months since the killings. There is still a faint stain of soot on the road, now almost washed away by rain. \n \n Not long after the killings, the victims' families and friends put up a makeshift memorial at the site, with small crosses and stuffed animals, and balloons, now-deflated. The crosses read, \"mother,\" \"sister,\" \"daughter,\" \"dad.\" \n \n But within days of Cordell's sentencing in November, someone smashed the little shrine, breaking the crosses and destroying the mementos. \n \n \"It was where we could all go to remember them,\" said Kellie Roll. \"And now that's gone too.\" \n \n And they are still faced with one haunting question: \n \n Did someone get away with murder that day?",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A Michigan town so small it doesn't have a McDonald's or a Walmart is the setting for a dark triple-murder mystery involving drugs, love-fueled jealousy, and a burned-out car, all outlined in the Detroit Free Press. The brutal killings of Heather Aldrich, her sister Carrie Nelson, and Nelson's boyfriend Jody Hutchinson\u2014all of whom were reportedly asphyxiated\u2014and the discovery of their bodies in a burned-out SUV in the woods was linked back to Aldrich's relationship with Kenneth Brunke, who police and locals say was a gun-happy Manistique drug dealer, and his friend Garry Cordell, who tried to tell Brunke that Aldrich, the object of Brunke's affections, was using him for drugs. And Aldrich did steal a cocaine stash from Brunke's yard, which was followed by a text from Brunke ostensibly meant to lure Aldrich to come over for some free morphine. Aldrich headed to Brunke's house, along with Nelson and Hutchinson, which is where the story takes a weird turn. At first Cordell and his girlfriend, Marietta Carlson, confessed they and Brunke had killed the victims, though the stories kept changing; Brunke denied participating. But then, despite what looked to be certain convictions for all three, Carlson died while in custody, and Cordell suddenly dropped a bombshell: He and Carlson had committed all the murders themselves and Brunke hadn't been present (though he says Brunke did help set the car on fire with the victims' bodies in it). What some believe: Brunke may have paid off Cordell, an unemployed drifter, or promised to take care of Cordell's elderly mother if he took the blame. The cryptic statement Cordell offered in court when asked about a money exchange only fueled that suspicion: \"One man shall die so that the other may live.\" Cordell was sentenced to life in prison, per WLUC; Brunke will likely get five years or less for obstructing justice and lying to a cop when he's sentenced Jan. 21. (Read all about the fascinating case, including why locals are angry at the county prosecutor, in the Detroit Free Press.)",

The 47-year-old was one of three people arrested in April for the triple murder of Jody Hutchinson, Carrie Nelson, and Heather Aldrich, whose bodies were found in a burned car in Gould City in April. A second suspect, Kenneth Brunke, pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and lying to police in October. \"You gave my children's brother and my grandchildren's father no mercy, I beg the court to give you none,\" said Jody's mother, Linda Cole, at Cordell's sentencing. \"My family has seen nothing of that in you and that's OK, your time will come.

(Photo: Luca Zennaro, AFP/Getty Images) Story Highlights On Friday, Francis issued impassioned plea for the downtrodden \n \n World Youth Day events have drawn more than 300,000 to Rio \n \n Deluge of rain forced organizers to change plans for final Mass on Sunday \n \n RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 An estimated three million Catholics crammed onto the iconic Copacabana Beach Saturday night for a vigil with Pope Francis, whose visit to Brazil culminates tomorrow with a Mass that is expected to convene an even bigger crowd. \n \n The vigil capped a busy day for Francis, who arrived in Brazil July 22 for World Youth Day, a biannual gathering of young Catholics. \n \n Earlier on Saturday, Francis told an assembly of Catholic bishops in the cathedral of Rio de Janeiro to get out of their cathedrals and spread the gospel and serve those most in need. \n \n It was yet another admonishment from the first Latin American pontiff \u2014 who has called for a Church focused on the poor \u2014 for Catholics to adopt a more missionary mind-set. It also blasted bishops from Brazil, where the number of faithful has shrunk to less than 65% of the population in what is still the world's most Catholic country. \n \n \"We cannot keep ourselves shut up in parishes, in our communities, when so many people are waiting for the Gospel,\" Francis said. \n \n \"Let us courageously look to pastoral needs, beginning on the periphery (of where we live), with those who are farthest away, with those who do not usually go to church. They, too, are invited to the table of the Lord.\" \n \n It was message aimed at reviving an institution dating back centuries in Latin America, but one becoming less relevant in the region as people become culturally Catholic or leave the church all together \u2014 often for Evangelical congregations. Those congregations have often better identified basic needs in poor Brazilian neighbourhoods and addressed issues like domestic violence and alcohol abuse, instead of speaking about more global ideas like social justice, says Andrew Chesnut, religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University and the author of a book on Brazil's Evangelicals \n \n Francisca Martinez, 21, traveled to World Youth Day in Rio de Janeiro from Guam. She said the chance to meet other young Catholics was the one of the best parts of attending. (Photo: David Agren, USA TODAY) \n \n Papal spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said the speech to the bishops was the longest of his pontificate and outlines his vision for them, Catholic News Service reported. \n \n The pope later took his straight-talking style to a speech for intellectuals and Brazil's political and business leaders. He implored them to open opportunities for everyone in a country rife with inequality, expand dialogue with all sectors of society and work toward \"eliminating forms of elitism and eradicating poverty.\" \n \n Brazil has been beset by demonstrations over protesters' complaints of an unresponsive political class, police repression and irresponsible spending on sports stadiums for the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics \u2014 while infrastructure remains inadequate and the health and school systems provide poor service. \n \n Francis called for \"social humility\" and dialogue without directly mentioning the protests. \n \n \"When leaders in various fields ask me for advice, my response is always the same: dialogue, dialogue, dialogue,\" he said. \"It is the only way for individuals, families and societies to grow, the only way for the life of peoples to progress.\" \n \n Francis frequently criticized corruption and the political class in his native Argentina, especially the populist politics of President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner and politicians forming patronage groups among the poor. \n \n \"Politicians hated him, but people love him,\" said Marina Artese, 23, a schoolteacher from Buenos Aires. \n \n Looking to the wider world, he added, \"Peaceful coexistence between different religions is favored by the secularism of the state.\" \n \n For young people, their Saturday focus was on faith. Many made pilgrimages by walking to the Copacabana Beach. \n \n Once there, they staked out spots on the sand. Some slept, played soccer and build sandcastles under sunny skies as they waited for the pope to arrive for what was to be a solemn event. \n \n \"It's a true experience of faith,\" said Chris Whitson, who help chaperon a group of 86 youths from Georgia and the Carolinas. \n \n \"I hope that youth take away the courage to live their faith in a more concrete way,\" said Jose Luis Hernandez, a priest from Atlanta. \n \n \"The community of young people from around the world,\" said Francisca Martinez, 21, a student from Guam. \n \n \"To have something in common helps (overcome) the language barriers.\" \n \n Many young people planned to camp on the beach Saturday night, pitching tents and spreading out sleeping bags to sleep under the stars. Organizers asked those doing so to donate their sleeping bags afterward to the homeless. \n \n On Friday night, Francis issued an impassioned plea for the downtrodden and oppressed while addressing throngs of young Catholics on Copacabana Beach for a re-enactment of Christ going to his crucifixion. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1e28CKB",

The explosion was not a controlled blast, but happened unintentionally as the robot was cutting the device, according to Mayor Christian Bollwage. No one was injured in the blast, Bollwage said. \n \n Authorities found five devices inside a single backpack near the train station, including one that was detonated. After the explosion, press and bystanders were moved back because the four other explosive devices inside of the backpack were still believed to be live, Bollwage said. \n \n No other explosions were heard as of 5 a.m. \n \n \n \n \n \n On Twitter, the FBI's Newark division described the devices as \"multiple improvised explosive devices.\" \n \n Earlier Sunday night, the FBI detained five people in Brooklyn for questioning related to the Saturday night explosion in Manhattan that injured more than two dozen people. \n \n The Elizabeth incident unfolded after two men found the backpack in a waste basket on North Broad Street and Julian Place around 8 p.m. Sunday, the mayor said. \n \n The men took the backpack \"because they thought it was of some value,\" walked for a bit, then saw wires and a pipe, dropped the package and notified Elizabeth police, he said. \n \n Bollwage told reporters the explosives were originally found in the trash can about 300 feet from the door of Willy's Place near the train station in the city of about 125,000, which is also the Union County seat. \n \n \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" Bollwage told reporters. \n \n Bollwage said the Elizabeth devices did not contain a cell phone or any other electronic detonators. \n \n After the items were found, Union County's Bomb Squad was called in and used a drone to examine the backpack, the mayor said. \n \n \"The drone indicated it could be suspicious and it could be a live bomb,\" Bollwage said. \n \n When asked if he ever thought Elizabeth would be the target of such an attack, Bollwage said he was not sure the city was the intended target and that the devices could have instead been dumped by a person who realized he or she was being investigated. \n \n \"I'm not willing to admit Elizabeth is a terror target,\" Bollwage said. \"Because of the location, it's very possible someone was trying to get rid of package as opposed to set it off.\" \n \n Bollwage said FBI agents are reviewing surveillance footage from the restaurant near the trash can where the backpack was first found by the two men. \n \n \n \n \n \n Reached after midnight on Monday morning, a spokesman for the FBI in Newark, Special Agent Michael Whitaker, said only that his agency had responded to the scene, and declined to provide any details of the investigation. \n \n The FBI asked anyone with information to call 1-800-CALL-FBI. \n \n Police cordoned off the station and many streets surrounding it. The investigation halted train service on the busy Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coastline commuter rail lines. Later, officials said service would resume at 5:30 Monday, with delays expected. \n \n Tickets and passes on both rail lines are being cross-honored on PATH along with NJ Transit and private buses, according to the transit agency. \n \n Amtrak service was also suspended near Elizabeth, spokesman Craig Schulz said in a statement. \n \n \"We apologize to our customers for the inconvenience and will resume service as soon as it is safe to do so,\" the spokesman said. \n \n Approximately 2,400 Amtrak passengers were impacted by the service suspension, the spokesman said. \n \n \"Robust security measures are in place at stations, on trains and along the tracks and Amtrak Police remain in close contact with local, state and federal partner agencies to coordinate and share intelligence information,\" the statement said. \"At this time there are no specific or credible threats against Amtrak.\" \n \n It was not immediately clear if the Elizabeth incident was linked to a bombing Saturday night in New York City that injured 29 people or another pipe-bomb style device that went off near a military charity race in Seaside Park also on Saturday. \n \n BREAKING PHOTO: blast near Elizabeth NJ train station as bomb techs try to disarm device.

Another possibly-explosive device discovered blocks away was safely removed early Sunday. \n \n Sources told CBS New York Sunday evening that the FBI made a car stop on the Belt Parkway near the Verrzano Bridge. There are several people in custody. It\u2019s unknown the reasons for the car stop or whether its in regards to Chelsea. \n \n The FBI said in a statement that at 8:45 p.m., the FBI and NYPD conducted a traffic stop of a vehicle of interest in the investigation into Saturday\u2019s bombing in Manhattan. No one has been charged with any crime. The investigation is continuing. \n \n Officials said there\u2019s no evidence currently linking the explosion to terrorism, and said the incident appeared to be unrelated to a pipe bomb explosion earlier Saturday in Seaside Park, New Jersey near the start line of a charity run. \n \n \u201cWe know from everything we\u2019ve seen so far that this was an intentional act. Again we do not know the nature of it, we do not know the motivation,\u201d de Blasio said. \n \n At a press conference earlier on Sunday morning, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he had spoken with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, and so far the explosives did not appear to be similar. \n \n Atlhough Cuomo on Sunday referred to the explosion as an act of \u201cterrorism,\u201d NYPD, FBI and other NYC officials were hesitant to use the phrase until a suspect or motive could be established. \n \n In an appearance on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d Rep. Peter King, R- N.Y., said it could still well turnout to be a terrorist act. \n \n \u201cWe had the Times Square bombing back in New York in 2011,\u201d King said. \u201cIt took several days before we realized that that was coming out of the Taliban and Pakistan.\u201d \n \n Roselyn Olivares, who lives on 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues, said the blast did damage to her fourth floor apartment. \n \n \u201cMy bedroom window was blown out,\u201d she told 1010 WINS Radio. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201d \n \n During the U.N. General Assembly, New York typically increases police presence, but officials said Sunday law enforcement would be on particularly high alert in the city this week, as a result of the explosion. \n \n Cuomo said 1,000 additional law enforcement officers were being deployed after the Saturday night blast in Chelsea, a primarily residential neighborhood on Manhattan\u2019s west side that\u2019s known for its art galleries and large gay population. \n \n Stephane Dujarric, Spokesman for the U.N. Secretary General, told CBS News\u2019 Pamela Falk that more than 14,000 passes have been issued for dignitaries, their aides, and additional press for the U.N. General Assembly this year. \n \n \u201cSecurity inside the United Nations is being assessed on a constant basis. Outside of the UN, security is the responsibility of the host country. We receive great cooperation and appreciate the support from the federal authorities and the NYPD throughout the year, and especially during the General Assembly to keep staff, delegates and visitors safe,\u201d Dujarric said. \n \n It was unclear who was behind the blasts in New York and New Jersey, and what motivated them. A law enforcement source tells CBS News senior investigative producer Pat Milton that while no suspect nor motive has been established, terrorism has not definitively been ruled out as a possibility. \n \n The second device that officers investigated four blocks from the Chelsea scene was a pressure cooker with a cellphone and wires attached, and was found in a plastic bag. The device was removed with a robot and taken to a department firing range in the Bronx. \n \n An NYPD official tells CBS News they were successfully able to pull the device apart. They did not have to blow it up. \n \n Two law enforcement sources tell CBS News the device that exploded appears to also have been a pressure cooker bomb. One source said officials believe it was set off with a cellphone signal. \n \n New York Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill said at Sunday afternoon press conference that a bomb squad was still investigating the device. \n \n Authorities have one person on surveillance video seen planting at least one of bombs in Manhattan, CBS News learned Sunday night. This individual has not been identified. Authorities stress that he may or may not be the person who did this, but it is a solid lead. \n \n A source tells CBS News that they have not yet definitively made the connection between the blast in Chelsea, and the blast in Seaside. However, the source says both the Chelsea bombs and the Seaside Park bombs use cellphones as triggers. \n \n The New York Times reports the second device appeared to be similar to the devices used in the Boston Marathon bombing. \n \n Homemade pressure cooker bombs were used in the Boston Marathon attacks in 2013 that killed three people and injured more than 260. \n \n \n \n The explosion that rocked a bustling Chelsea neighborhood appeared to have come from a construction toolbox in front of a building. Photos from the scene show a twisted and crumpled black metal box. \n \n \u201cThis is a very dense area, the whole block is restaurants and residences and this area on a warm Saturday night is an area swarming with people,\u201d New York City Councilman Cory Johnson told CBS New York. \n \n The blast happened on West 23rd Street, in front of a residence for the blind, near a major thoroughfare with many restaurants and a Trader Joe\u2019s supermarket. Witnesses said the explosion at about 8:30 p.m. blew out the windows of businesses and scattered debris in the area. Officials said no evacuations were necessary. \n \n On Sunday, a team of five FBI agents searched an Uber driver\u2019s vehicle that had been damaged in the Manhattan blast, ripping off the door panels inside as they examined it for evidence. \n \n The driver, MD Alam, of Brooklyn, had just picked up three passengers and was driving along 23rd Street when the explosion occurred, shattering the car\u2019s windows and leaving gaping holes in the rear passenger-side door. \n \n \u201cIt was so loud,\u201d the 32-year-old Alam said. \u201cI was so scared. There was a loud boom and then smoke and I just drove away.\u201d \n \n Alam said he hit the gas and tried to take his passengers to their destination in Queens, but pulled over along Madison Avenue and 39th Street. He went to a local police precinct to file a report for his insurance company and police contacted the FBI. \n \n New York City subway routes were affected by the explosion, which rattled some New Yorkers and visitors on the heels of the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks. Cuomo said mass transit in the area would resume as early as Monday. \n \n In Los Angeles, Police Chief Charlie Beck asked Emmys attendees to remain vigilant in the wake of explosions in New York City and New Jersey. Beck said there were no known credible threats to security in Los Angeles, but those attending Sunday\u2019s Emmys in downtown Los Angeles were asked to report any suspicious activity. ||||| ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) \u2014 A suspicious device found in a trash can near a New Jersey train station exploded early Monday as a bomb squad was attempting to disarm it with a robot, officials said. \n \n Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage said that the FBI was working to disarm one of five devices found in the same bag, which was discovered in a trash can by two men around 8:30 p.m. Sunday, near the Elizabeth train station on New Jersey Transit's Northeast Corridor rail line. The men had reported seeing wires and a pipe coming out of the package, Bollwage said. \n \n There was no immediate report of injuries or damage. A message left with the FBI wasn't immediately returned. The mayor warned that other explosions were expected. \n \n NJ Transit service was suspended early Monday between Newark Liberty Airport and Elizabeth, and New Jersey-bound Amtrak trains were being held at New York Penn Station, officials said, while New York-bound Amtrak trains were being held in Trenton. \n \n Train passengers reported being stuck on Amtrak and NJ Transit trains for hours Sunday night, while some trains moved in reverse to let passengers off at other stations. Amtrak said 2,400 passengers were affected and that trains were being brought into other stations for people to get other transportation. It wasn't clear when the Elizabeth station would be open, a threat to cause major issues on the Monday morning commute into New York. \n \n The discovery of the suspicious package comes a day after an explosion in Manhattan injured 29 people, and an unexploded pressure-cooker device was found four blocks away. Also Saturday, a pipe bomb exploded about an hour from the Elizabeth train station in Seaside Park, New Jersey, forcing the cancellation of a military charity 5K run. Officials said it didn't appear that those two incidents were connected, though they weren't ruling anything out. \n \n Investigators didn't immediately comment on whether they thought the Elizabeth incident was connected to either of the two blasts. \n \n Bollwage said that he wasn't willing to say that Elizabeth had become a target, and that it was possible that someone worried about the authorities was trying to get rid of the package. \n \n \"I'm extremely concerned for the residents of the community, but more importantly extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt,\" Bollwage said. \n \n ___ \n \n This story has been corrected to show that the bag was found around 8:30 p.m., not 9:30 p.m. ||||| The discovery of a bag containing explosive devices near a train station in Elizabeth was causing big headaches for commuters. NJ Transit service was partially suspended and Amtrak trains weren't able to travel from New York Penn Station to Newark Penn Station. Checkey Beckford reports. (Published Monday, Sept. 19, 2016) \n \n What to Know Five people were taken into custody by the FBI Sunday for questioning after a traffic stop on the Verrazano Bridge \n \n As that was happening, a suspicious package was discovered at the Elizabeth train station in New Jersey \n \n Trains were halted between EWR and Elizabeth, halting traffic on the busy North East Corridor ahead of the morning rush \n \n Commuting will be a struggle Monday for thousands of NJ Transit and Amtrak commuters as authorities continue their investigations into a series of explosions and incendiary devices in New York City and New Jersey over the weekend. \n \n New Jersey Transit warned trains on multiple lines were subject to delays of up to an hour amid the ongoing police investigation. \n \n Service on all Northeast Corridor and North Jersey Coast lines resumed Monday morning. It had been suspended in both directions late Sunday night after a device found inside a bag near the NJ Transit station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, exploded. \n \n NJ Transit said commuters should expect residual delays and service changes as the investigation in Elizabeth continues. \n \n All New Jersey-bound Amtrak trains were also held at New York Penn Station after the bag was discovered in Elizabeth, hampering travel on the busy North East Corridor. Trains began moving out of New York Penn around 5:30 a.m. \n \n Amtrak said that Acela Express, Northeast Regional and other services will operate Monday with some schedule modifications. The railroad service said that passengers should expect cancellations and delays throughout the day. \n \n In Manhattan, West 23rd Street between Sixth and Seventh avenues reopened by 9 p.m. Monday after police spent the weekend investigating the blast there. Other roads that were initially closed for the investigation -- including parts of Sixth Avenue, Seventh Avenue, and West 14th to West 23rd streets -- were reopened earlier. \n \n PATH trains are skipping 23rd Street in Manhattan. PATH will cross-honor NJT passengers at NWK, HOB, WTC and 33rd Street stations. \n \n The 1 train has resumed making normal stops at its 23rd and 28th street stations, though the northeast stairway at the 23rd Street station remains closed, according to @NYCTSubway. The E and F trains are also stopping again at 23rd Street stations. \n \n Due to the 23rd Street closure, MTA buses M5, M7, M23 and X1 are detoured in both directions. \n \n The news of the suspicious bag at the Elizabeth station in New Jersey was first reported late Sunday night, around the same time that the FBI said it had taken five people from Elizabeth, New Jersey into custody for questioning after a traffic stop on the Verrazano Bridge. \n \n The FBI confirmed that the 8:45 p.m. Verrazano traffic stop was part of an investigation into Saturday's bombing in Manhattan that injured 29 people. None of them have been charged with a crime and the investigation is ongoing. \n \n The devices in Elizabeth apparently looked similar to what detonated in Seaside Park, New Jersey, on Saturday morning ahead of a race. No one was injured in the Seaside Park explosion. \n \n Hunt for Clues in 'Intentional' Chelsea Explosion ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Wednesday were looking into whether an Afghan-born American citizen charged with carrying out bombings in New York and New Jersey acted alone or had help as the city\u2019s top federal public defender sought access to the suspect. \n \n Police in New York City said they had not yet been permitted by doctors to speak to Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, who was arrested on Monday after being wounded in a gunfight with police in Linden, New Jersey. \n \n Rahami has been charged with wounding 31 people in a bombing in New York on Saturday that authorities called a \u201cterrorist act.\u201d \n \n The Federal Bureau of Investigation released a photo of two men who found a second, unexploded pressure cooker device they say Rahami left in a piece of luggage in Manhattan\u2019s Chelsea neighborhood on Saturday night. \n \n The two men, who took the bag but left the improvised bomb on the street are not suspects, officials said, but investigators want to interview them as witnesses. \n \n \u201cAs far as whether he\u2019s a lone actor, that\u2019s still the path we are following, but we are keeping all the options open,\u201d William Sweeney, the FBI\u2019s assistant director in New York, told reporters. \n \n Rahami is also charged with planting a bomb that exploded in Seaside Park, New Jersey, but did not injure anyone and planting explosive devices in his hometown of Elizabeth, New Jersey, which did not detonate. He faces charges from federal prosecutors in both states. \n \n Federal prosecutors portray Rahami, who came to the United States at age 7 and became a naturalized citizen, as embracing militant Islamic views, begging for martyrdom and expressing outrage at the U.S. \u201cslaughter\u201d of Muslim fighters in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Palestine. \n \n Investigators were also probing Rahami\u2019s history of travel to Afghanistan and Pakistan, and looking for evidence that he may have picked up radical views or trained in bomb-making. \n \n Both government and pro-Taliban sources in Pakistan on Wednesday said they had no knowledge of Rahami having met with prominent people connected to the Taliban or other religious groups. \n \n Prosecutors plan to move Rahami to New York from the New Jersey hospital where he is being treated as soon as his medical condition allows, said Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan. \n \n Policemen place in an ambulance a man they identified as Ahmad Khan Rahami, who is wanted for questioning in connection with an explosion in New York City, in Linden, New Jersey, in this still image taken from video September 19, 2016. REUTERS/Anthony Genaro \n \n DEFENSE LAWYER DEMANDS COURT APPEARANCE \n \n Rahami\u2019s wife met with U.S. law enforcement officials while in the United Arab Emirates and voluntarily gave a statement, a law enforcement official said on Wednesday. She was not in custody. \n \n A New Jersey U.S. congressman previously said Rahami had emailed his office in 2014 for help in getting her a visa to enter the United States from Pakistan when she was pregnant. \n \n Rahami\u2019s defense attorney, David Patton, on Wednesday demanded that his first court appearance to be scheduled as soon as possible, even if it occurs in his hospital bed, saying that the defendant had a constitutional right to a lawyer and a court appearance within two days of his arrest. \n \n New York Police Commissioner James O\u2019Neill told a news conference that investigators had not yet received doctors\u2019 clearance to interview Rahami, adding, \u201cThat may happen in the next 24 hours, pending the doctors\u2019 approval.\u201d \n \n Federal prosecutors in New York noted that while they had filed charges against Rahami, he remained in the custody of state officials in New Jersey, who initially arrested him after Monday\u2019s gunfight. They said that makes Patton\u2019s request for access premature. \n \n Patton, in a subsequent filing, shot back that such delays were unacceptable. \n \n \u201cMr. Rahami was arrested more than 48 hours ago. His bail in New Jersey was set without any appointment of counsel or court appearance. He still has not been provided counsel. He does not have a scheduled court appearance in New Jersey until next week,\u201d Patton said. \n \n Slideshow (21 Images) \n \n The attacks in New York and New Jersey were the latest in a series in the United States inspired by Islamic militant groups including al Qaeda and Islamic State. A pair of ethnic Chechen brothers killed three people and injured more than 260 at the 2013 Boston Marathon with homemade pressure-cooker bombs similar to those used in this weekend\u2019s attacks. \n \n Rahami, in other parts of a journal that prosecutors said he was carrying when he was arrested, praised \u201cBrother\u201d Osama bin Laden, the al Qaeda leader slain in a 2011 U.S. raid in Pakistan; Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born Muslim cleric and leading al Qaeda propagandist who was killed in a 2011 U.S. drone strike in Yemen; and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army psychiatrist who shot dead 13 people and wounded 32 at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009. \n \n Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, house Homeland Security Committee chairman, told CNN that Rahami\u2019s writings in a journal showed that his actions had been inspired by Islamic State as \u201chis guidance came from the lead ISIS spokesman.\u201d \n \n \u201cWhat that tells me as a counterterrorism expert that now we can definitively say this was an ISIS-inspired terrorist attack.\u201d ||||| (CNN) Three attacks in 12 hours -- explosions on New York and New Jersey streets and a stabbing spree in a Minnesota mall -- combined for tumultuous weekend, afflicting injury and moments of alarm and leaving investigators scrambling for answers. \n \n As Monday's sunrise approached, New York City ramped up security not only because of the bombing that injured 29 people in Manhattan and the discovery of a mysterious device blocks away, but also because world leaders are gathering at the United Nations for debate at the General Assembly. \n \n Questions abounded about Saturday's incidents, including: What, exactly, were the motives? \n \n There were hints in the Minnesota attack, with ISIS claiming that a man who injured nine people in stabbings in St. Cloud before an off-duty police officer killed him was a \"soldier of the Islamic State,\" though there was no immediate evidence he'd had contact with the terror group. \n \n A recap of the three incidents, all of which authorities said were being investigated as possible terror acts: \n \n \u2022 Around 9:30 a.m. in Seaside Park, New Jersey, one of three pipe-bomb-type devices that were wired together detonated in a garbage can, tearing apart the container but injuring no one; the other two didn't explode, federal law enforcement officials said. \n \n Officials said the blast probably was timed to disrupt a Marine Corps charity run, but no one was near the blast because registration problems delayed the race. Officials said the device had a cell phone as a timer; no one has claimed responsibility. \n \n \u2022 Around 8:30 p.m. in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, an explosion rocked 23rd Street and 6th Avenue, injuring 29 people and sending panicked people scrambling for cover. A law enforcement source said it came from a device planted in or near a dumpster. \n \n Investigators found an intact pressure cooker blocks away. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the pressure cooker and the exploded device in Chelsea were similar, and other officials said both devices had cell phones as apparent timers. No one has claimed responsibility. Investigators found similarities between the explosives used in both states, according to multiple law enforcement officials, but authorities said they have not concluded the incidents are linked. \n \n \u2022 About 9 p.m. ET (8 p.m. CT) in St. Cloud, Minnesota, a man wearing a security uniform entered Crossroads mall, made a reference to Allah and stabbed nine people before an off-duty police officer shot him dead, police said. He asked at least one person whether he or she was a Muslim before he attacked, witnesses said. \n \n JUST WATCHED Mayor: Off-duty officer who shot attacker a hero Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Mayor: Off-duty officer who shot attacker a hero 01:18 \n \n Police did not immediately release the attacker's name, and CNN hasn't independently verified ISIS' claim that he was linked to the group. St. Cloud's police chief said investigators were \"trying to get to the bottom of his motivations.\" No official has suggested ties between the mall attack and the explosions in New Jersey and New York. \n \n NYC police presence 'bigger than ever' \n \n New Yorkers already were going to see a big police presence in the city because of the 71st session of the UN General Assembly, about a 2-mile drive from the Chelsea blast site. \n \n An explosion in New York City injured 29. \n \n But Saturday's explosion means the police presence will be even more intense, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday. \n \n \"You should know you will see a very substantial NYPD presence this week -- bigger than ever,\" he said \n \n And Cuomo said 1,000 additional New York State Police officers and National Guard troops will be deployed to patrol bus terminals, airports and subway stations. \n \n 'This is a new era' \n \n Saturday's incidents follow a few other mass attacks that happened on US soil in the past year, including the deadly December shootings in San Bernardino, California, and the deadly June shootings at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. In both of those incidents, the attackers claimed an affinity for ISIS. \n \n Threat of Islamist attacks alone has kept federal investigators busy -- the FBI has said that it is mounting 900 investigations of suspected Islamist militants in all 50 states. FBI Director James Comey said in July that ISIS terrorists may be dispersed in the West as the terror group loses territory in Iraq and Syria. \n \n But Comey isn't worried just about Islamist terror threats. \n \n \"Our focus now is on a much more disparate threat that's hard to see -- unpredictable, motivated, and driven by people who are just disturbed,\" he said in an interview posted Friday on the FBI's website. \n \n New York isn't the only metropolis to take notice of Saturday's attacks. On the other coast, Los Angeles' police were gearing up for two high-profile events Sunday: the Emmy Awards and the Los Angeles Rams' first home game since their return from two decades in St. Louis. \n \n \"As you wake up this morning to the troubling events in New York and New Jersey, please rest assured we have been monitoring the situation throughout the night,\" Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said in a statement released on Twitter. He said police had taken steps to ensure the Emmys and the football game would be safe, and asked people to be vigilant. Both events took place without incident. \n \n US Rep. Charlie Rangel, a Democrat who represents Manhattan, told CNN that Saturday's attacks -- and a level of vigilance needed to combat them -- represent \"a new norm.\" \n \n \"This is a new era, and everyone just has to be alert,\" he said Sunday. \n \n Photos: Explosion in Manhattan New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, right, and New York Gov.

As a precaution, local rail and bus service was suspended. \n \n After two men spotted the suspicious package, which had wires and a pipe but no apparent timing devices, they reported it to authorities. The FBI's bomb squad then deployed a robot to examine the devices. The suspicious package exploded after the bomb robot cut a wire in an effort to disarm the device. \n \n Authorities do not know if the Elizabeth explosion has ties to the Chelsea bombing. \n \n 'The entire neighborhood is real scared' \n \n Many in Chelsea were rattled by Saturday's bombing. Danilo Gabrielli, 50, was watching TV at his 23rd Street apartment about a block away from the explosion site when he heard the blast. He rushed to see what had happened and found a chaotic scene. \n \n \"We smelled something, like an intense sulfur smell, and saw smoke coming out of this building. I saw pieces of metal -- not large, but not small either. A few friends of mine saw glass there.\" \n \n Gabrielli said \"the entire neighborhood is real scared.\" \n \n \"It's a real quiet neighborhood -- not like the center of the city or the Wall Street area. It's tiny bars, where you go to grab a drink, grab a bite to eat, watch a film. We were worried.\" \n \n 'It's not stalling everybody that lives here' \n \n Ryker Allen, 19, noticed the increased security presence in Manhattan. He woke up Sunday at his home in the Flatiron District, not far from the explosion, and saw \"easily 100 police officers\" meeting in front of his building. \n \n He said the attack was unnerving, but people still were going about their business. \n \n \"I feel like it's something that's kind of hovering over, but it's not stalling everybody that lives here. It's not stopping anybody from getting their tasks done,\" he said. \n \n Allen wasn't alone in taking it in stride. \n \n For those trying to capitalize on the explosion: People aren't freaking out in Chelsea.

The FBI says the other four devices found will be encased in blastproof material and taken to the agency's headquarters for further investigation, the New York Times reports. The devices\u2014which were discovered by two men who found the backpack on top of a garbage can outside a restaurant near the Elizabeth station\u2014will be closely examined for evidence linking them to explosive devices found in New York City and elsewhere in New Jersey over the weekend. A round-up of coverage: Elizabeth Mayor Christian Bollwage says the two men thought the backpack held something of value and carried it some distance before realizing it held explosive devices and calling police, NJ.com. He says in its original location near a pub, the devices could have caused carnage. \"If that pub was crowded and there was a lot of people there, it could have severely injured, killed and maimed many, many people,\" the mayor says. The AP reports that thousands of Amtrak and NJ Transit passengers were affected by the discovery of the device, with some stuck on trains for hours. Service has resumed but passengers in the area have been warned that they can expect delays Monday. NBC New York reports that investigators believe surveillance video shows the same man at two locations where explosive devices were found in Manhattan. Police aren't sure whether there is a link between the New York devices and those found in New Jersey. CNN reports that there is now an increased security presence in New York City not just because of the bombs, but because world leaders are gathering for the United Nations General Assembly. A law enforcement source tells CBS that investigators believe cell phones were used as triggers for both the Manhattan blast\u2014which NY Gov. Andrew Cuomo calls \"obviously an act of terrorism\"\u2014and the device that exploded before a New Jersey race to benefit Marines and sailors early Saturday. It's not clear whether a trigger was found with the Elizabeth devices. Bollwage says he's not sure his city was targeted. He suspects somebody may have just dumped the devices in Elizabeth, but he is \"extremely concerned for everyone in the state and country where someone can just go and drop a backpack into a garbage can that has multiple explosives in it with no timers and then you have to wonder how many people could have been hurt.\" An official close to the investigation tells Reuters that all the devices involved have been crude and the level of planning appears low\u2014but some investigators fear this was just a test. \"That's what worries us,\" he says. \"Was this some kind of test run, not just of the devices, but also of the surveillance in New York and the response?\" (The FBI says it is questioning five people found in a \"vehicle of interest.\")",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 An explosive device was found in a garbage can near a New York City train station early today, the New York Daily News reports. According to NJ.com, the blast happened around 12:40am near Morris Avenue and Julian Place. No one was injured in the blast. The explosion was not a controlled blast but happened unintentionally as the robot was cutting the device, according to the FBI. The FBI is using surveillance footage to investigate the incident. It's not clear if the device was related to the explosion in Manhattan over the weekend that injured 29 people.

Mikhail Kalashnikov spent his career designing and perfecting assault rifles. More than 100 million Kalashnikovs have been sold worldwide. The gun brought Kalashnikov fame and a string of awards. But his letter to the Patriarch suggests that, towards the end of his life, Kalashnikov felt a degree of guilt - or \"spiritual pain\" as he puts it - for having invented a killing machine. It's unclear, though, how much of this he wrote himself.

Izvestia quotes Kalashnikov's daughter, Elena, as saying she believes a priest helped her father compose the letter. \n \n The press secretary for the Russian Patriarch, Cyril Alexander Volkov, told the paper the religious leader had received Kalashnikov's letter and had written a reply. \n \n \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it,\" Mr Volkov was quoted as saying. \n \n \"He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.\" \n \n Kalashnikov received many Russian state honours, including the Order of Lenin and the Hero of Socialist Labour, but made little money from his gun. \n \n He died on 23 December after being admitted to hospital a month earlier with internal bleeding. ||||| In this Tuesday, Nov. 10, 2009 file photo Mikhail Kalashnikov, who invented the AK-47 assault rifle, attends festivities to celebrate his 90th birthday at the Kremlin in Moscow.

I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" he asked. \n \n The typed letter on Kalashnikov's personal writing paper, reproduced by Izvestia, is signed with a wavering hand by the man who describes himself as \"a slave of God, the designer Mikhail Kalashnikov.\" \n \n Kalashnikov, whose funeral was attended by President Vladimir Putin, came up with the durable and simple rifle design after experiencing the Red Army's dire lack of weapons during World War II. \n \n Now the AK-47 is widely manufactured unlicenced around the world and has become a visual hallmark of armed insurgent movements, including those using child soldiers. \n \n Kalashnikov wrote that he first went into a church at the age of 91 and was later baptised. \n \n The Patriarch's press secretary, Alexander Volkov, told Izvestia that the Russian Church leader received the letter and wrote a personal reply. \n \n \"The Church has a very definite position: when weapons serve to protect the Fatherland, the Church supports both its creators and the soldiers who use it,\" Volkov said. \n \n \"He designed this rifle to defend his country, not so terrorists could use it in Saudi Arabia.\" \n \n The Russian Orthodox Church has sought to consolidate its new-found strength after the Soviet era by building up close ties with state agencies and powerful officials. \n \n When Kalashnikov was feted by the Soviet authorities, it would have been unthinkable for him to have declared himself anything else than an atheist. \n \n His daughter, Yelena, told Izvestia: \"Of course you can't say he went to services or lived strictly according to the commandments.

The AFP picks up a report from Russia's Izvestia that Kalashnikov penned a letter to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church nine months before his December death in which he wrote of \"unbearable ... spiritual pain\" and asked about his culpability. It contains this line: \"I keep having the same unsolved question: if my rifle took away people's lives, then can it be that I ... am guilty for people's deaths, even if they were enemies?\" AFP notes that Izvestia ran a copy of the letter, which is typed on Kalashnikov's personal stationery and signed \"with a wavering hand.\" A rep for Patriarch Kirill confirms that the letter was sent, and says the church leader wrote a reply\u2014one that very may well have calmed his fears.

(AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin) (Associated Press) \n \n Speaking to a gathering of Libertarians in Las Vegas before headlining an event in Phoenix, Trump repeated his charge that Mexico was sending violent offenders to the U.S. to harm Americans and that U.S. officials were being \"dumb\" in dealing with immigrants in the country illegally. \n \n \"These people wreak havoc on our population,\" he told a few thousand people attending the Libertarian gathering FreedomFest inside a Planet Hollywood ballroom on the Las Vegas Strip. \n \n In the 4,200-capacity Phoenix convention center packed with flag-waving supporters, Trump took a different view \u2014 for a moment \u2014 and said: \"I love the Mexican people. I love 'em. Many, many people from Mexico are legal. They came in the old-fashioned way. Legally.\" \n \n He quickly returned to the sharp tone that has brought him scorn as well as praise. \"I respect Mexico greatly as a country. But the problem we have is their leaders are much sharper than ours, and they're killing us at the border and they're killing us on trade.\" \n \n His speeches in both venues were long on insults aimed at critics and short on solutions to the problems he cited. When he called for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, the audience in Las Vegas groaned. \n \n In a break from the immigration rhetoric that has garnered him condemnation and praise, Trump asserted that he would have more positive results in dealing with China and Russia if he were president and said he could be pals with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \n \n Asked by an audience member in Las Vegas about U.S.-Russia relations, Trump said the problem is that Putin doesn't respect Obama. \n \n \"I think we would get along very, very well,\" he said. \n \n Trump has turned to victims of crime to bolster his argument that immigrants in the U.S. illegally have killed and raped. In Las Vegas and Phoenix, he brought on stage Jamiel Shaw Sr., a Southern California man whose 17-year-old son was shot and killed in 2008 by a man in the country illegally. Shaw vividly described how his son was shot \u2014 in the head, stomach and hands while trying to block his face \u2014 and how he heard the gunshots as he talked to his son on the phone. \n \n Shaw said he trusted Trump, and encouraged the crowds in both cities to do the same. \n \n Trump's speeches were filled with tangents and insults leveled at business partners such as Univision and NBC that have dropped him in the wake of his comments that Mexican immigrants bring drugs and crime to the U.S. and are rapists. He also directed familiar barbs at other presidential contenders, including Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton (\"the worst secretary of state in the history of the country\"), news media figures (\"lyin' Brian Williams\") and President Barack Obama (\"such a divisive person\"). He called journalists \"terrible people.\" \n \n As Trump lambasted Univision for cancelling its broadcast of the Miss USA pageant, one of his many business enterprises, a group of young Latinos unfurled a banner pointed toward the stage and began chanting insults. They were quickly drowned out by the crowd, and nearby Trump supporters began to grab at them, tearing at the banner and pulling and pushing at the protesters. Security staff managed to get to the group and escorted them out as Trump resumed speaking. \n \n \"I wonder if the Mexican government sent them over here,\" he said. \"I think so.\" \n \n Arizona's tough-on-immigration Sheriff Joe Arpaio introduced Trump in Phoenix after outlining the things he and the candidate have in common, including skepticism that Obama was born in the United States. He went on to criticize the federal government for what he called a revolving door for immigrants, saying many of them end up in his jails. \n \n \"He's been getting a lot of heat, but you know, there's a silent majority out here,\" Arpaio said, borrowing from a phrase Richard Nixon popularized during his presidency in a speech about the Vietnam War. \n \n A single protester standing outside the room where Trump spoke in Las Vegas was more concerned about the businessman being tied to the Libertarian Party. \n \n \"I've been a Libertarian for 43 years and Trump ain't no Libertarian,\" said Linda Rawles, who asserted that including Trump in FreedomFest set back the party's movement. \n \n ___ \n \n Pierceall reported from Las Vegas. ||||| Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, whose caustic comments about Mexicans have inflamed the immigration debate, told thousands of cheering supporters here Saturday that \u201cwe have to take back the heart of our country.\u201d \n \n In a rambling, defiant speech delivered in this border state that has been the epicenter of the nation\u2019s divisive battle over immigration reform, Trump declared: \u201cThese are people that shouldn\u2019t be in our country. They flow in like water.\u201d One man in the crowd of 4,200 shouted back, \u201cBuild a wall!\u201d \n \n Basking in polls that show he has risen to the top of the crowded Republican field, Trump took obvious glee in mocking former Florida governor Jeb Bush, the establishment favorite who is setting fundraising records. \n \n \u201cJeb Bush, let\u2019s say he\u2019s president \u2014 Oy, yoy, yoy,\u201d Trump said. He asked the crowd: \u201cHow can I be tied with this guy? He\u2019s terrible. Terrible. He\u2019s weak on immigration.\u201d \n \n Trump\u2019s 70-minute address here, which sounded more like a stream-of-consciousness rant than a presidential-style stump speech, put an exclamation point on his bombastic push since his presidential announcement last month to return immigration to the forefront of the national conversation. \n \n Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump addresses supporters during a political rally in Phoenix on Saturday. (Charlie Leight/Getty Images) \n \n Bush and illegal immigrants were not the only targets of Trump\u2019s scorn: He also criticized Macy\u2019s, NBC, NASCAR, U.S. ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton and, several times, the media. \n \n Republican leaders say they believe the celebrity billionaire has virtually no chance of being their nominee, much less of making it to the White House. And, for now at least, his following seems limited to the far right as opposed to the party\u2019s mainstream. \n \n Yet Trump has reignited a heated debate over an issue, immigration, that the GOP had been determined to settle after it hurt Republicans in the most recent presidential election. \n \n Party leaders increasingly fear that Trump could do damage to more viable candidates, such as Bush, who could lose their own footing on immigration. These candidates confront a familiar challenge: During the primary season, they must deal with the anger and anxiety that many on the right feel about illegal immigration. But they must do it in a way that will not damage their appeal to a broader electorate in November 2016. \n \n Republicans are handling Trump delicately for another reason as well: They fear that he could leave the GOP entirely and wage a well-funded third-party campaign, a possibility that Trump has not ruled out. \n \n [GOP leaders fear damage to party\u2019s image as Donald Trump doubles down] \n \n After Trump repeatedly referred to illegal immigrants in the harshest of terms \u2014 calling them, among other things, killers and rapists \u2014 Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called Trump and asked him to tone things down. But that, if anything, has reinvigorated Trump and his vocal supporters. \n \n 1 of 9 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Cutting ties with Trump: Who has dumped him and why View Photos The Republican presidential hopeful has faced an avalanche of criticism over his characterization of illegal immigrants as \u201crapists,\u201d drug dealers and other criminals.

Voisin/The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. \n \n The crowd in Phoenix began lining up outside the convention center before dawn, with many spending hours in temperatures that exceeded 100 degrees. Hundreds of people, who stood in lines snaking down several downtown blocks, did not make it into the ballroom for his speech. \n \n Many of Trump\u2019s supporters blame illegal immigrants for crime and economic problems but also express dismay over cultural changes. \n \n \u201cWe don\u2019t recognize our country anymore,\u201d said Jan Drake, 72, who lives in a retirement community outside Phoenix. \u201cIf you\u2019re coming into our country, you have got to conform to what we stand for. You speak English. You don\u2019t try to change our country to what your country was.\u201d \n \n After watching Trump on television the past couple of weeks, Drake said that she has become convinced that \u201che would be a very strong president. He doesn\u2019t kowtow to anybody. The Republican Party will try to squeeze him out because they\u2019re afraid of him. But he can tell them where to go \u2014 to pound sand.\u201d \n \n After he walked onto a catwalk stage here like a rock star, Trump basked in his crowd. \u201cThe word is getting out that we have to stop illegal immigration,\u201d he said. \n \n While Trump was railing against Spanish-language broadcaster Univision, a handful of protesters in the crowd interrupted. Trump\u2019s security guards arrived to break up the skirmish that followed. His supporters screamed \u201cUSA! USA! USA!\u201d in the protesters\u2019 faces as the guards escorted them out of the convention hall. \n \n \u201cI wonder if the Mexican government sent them over here,\u201d Trump said from the stage. He assured the crowd, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019ll take our country back.\u201d \n \n Trump also had harsh words for Islamic State terrorists. If he becomes president, Trump said, \u201cThey will be in such trouble . . . ISIS, believe me, I would take them out so fast. You have to do it.\u201d \n \n But it was his crusade against illegal immigrants that had Trump\u2019s crowd most enthused. After expressing shock that his immigration message has resonated so strongly with the GOP base, Trump said, \u201cThe silent majority is back, and we\u2019re going to take the country back.\u201d He walked off the stage to Twisted Sister\u2019s \u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It.\u201d \n \n Earlier, as his plush Boeing 757 headed from an appearance in Las Vegas to Phoenix, Trump sat in a leather chair, surrounded by binders of articles about him and sipping a Coca-Cola \u2014 the full-calorie kind, he noted, because, \u201cHave you ever seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke?\u201d \n \n \u201cSomething is happening in America. You may not want to see it, but something big is happening. People are sick and tired of politicians, and I\u2019m here for them,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go right at the Mexican government. I\u2019m going to charge them $25,000 per illegal immigrant and, oh, I\u2019ll make them pay.\u201d \n \n (In his Phoenix speech, Trump put the figure at $100,000.) \n \n \u201cWould Bush do that? Would Rubio? I don\u2019t think so,\u201d Trump added, taking aim at two of his more mainstream rivals, Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). \n \n Polls consistently show that a majority of Americans, including most Republicans, support an overhaul of the law to give millions of undocumented immigrants a means of staying in this country legally. But a passionate fraction of the Republican electorate believe otherwise. \n \n Lou Brudnock, 71, said he is attracted to Trump\u2019s brash \u201ctruthfulness\u201d on immigration and his willingness to be politically incorrect. \n \n \u201cThis country today is sad, sad, sad,\u201d Brudnock said. \u201cYou can\u2019t say anything or they call you \u2018a racist.\u2019 It\u2019s like we\u2019re back in Nazi Germany. But look around, man. It\u2019s people here reading and listening to his message.\u201d \n \n Trump, by virtue of his celebrity, has provoked a backlash far more widespread than ever seen toward lesser-known immigration hard-liners, such as former Colorado congressman Tom Tancredo (R). That means he could leave lasting damage to the GOP and whoever turns out to be its 2016 standard-bearer. \n \n All of those cross-pressures were in play Saturday at Trump\u2019s appearances here and in Las Vegas. More mainstream Republicans had anticipated the spectacle and made no secret of their concern. \n \n \u201cI had hoped that we had moved on from some of the coarse rhetoric,\u201d said Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.). \u201cWhen there\u2019s so many candidates, you can appeal to a very small segment of the population and get news and get elevated.\u201d Flake is a leading proponent of a comprehensive immigration measure that would include a path to citizenship for those who are in the country illegally. \n \n Arizona has been a hotbed of anti-immigration sentiment, having passed a 2010 law that requires law enforcement officials to check the immigration status of people they detain and suspect are in the country illegally. \n \n Maricopa County, Ariz., Sheriff Joe Arpaio \u2014 who in some ways is the face of that law, having been the subject of racial-profiling lawsuits \u2014 helped warm up the crowd before Trump\u2019s arrival. \n \n \u201cI know that Donald Trump is speaking out,\u201d Arpaio said. \u201cHe\u2019s getting a lot of heat. But, you know, there\u2019s a silent majority out here.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re not silent anymore!\u201d a man in the crowd shouted. \n \n Arpaio brought up the mostly dormant questioning of President Obama\u2019s birth certificate. He and Trump are perhaps the most vocal of the \u201cbirthers,\u201d who falsely contend that Obama was not born in the United States. \n \n Immigration also has gained new attention after the June 30 shooting death of a woman along San Francisco\u2019s heavily touristed waterfront, allegedly by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times from the United States. \n \n Trump \u2014 along with much of the rest of the Republican field \u2014 has criticized the policies of \u201csanctuary cities,\u201d where officials cannot detain those they suspect of being in the country illegally unless they have other grounds to do so. \n \n Republican strategists say that it is possible to address anxiety over illegal immigration within the GOP base without alienating the electorate at large. Advisers to Bush and Rubio, for instance, say that their candidates can play a long game on the issue, continuing to make a case for comprehensive changes to the law, while waiting for the Trump boomlet to subside. \n \n \u201cYou can give a fuller picture of those types of people who are coming to America who are not documented, who are not legal,\u201d said Peter Wehner, who was a top official in George W. Bush\u2019s White House. \u201cAnd you can speak about them in a humane and decent and true way.\u201d \n \n Karen Tumulty in Washington contributed to this report.",

    "document": "Surface was the single biggest genuine tech surprise of the year so far. Microsoft tantalized us with a tablet that made the iPad look stale. Its snap-on keyboard made all laptops look immediately old fashioned. And it promised The Future of Computers. \n \n We hadn't looked forward to something this much in a long, long time. Now it's here. And it's been just as long a time since a gadget has been so disappointing. Surface is good, but Surface RT sure isn't the future. Not yet. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Why it matters \n \n The laptop is about as far advanced as one can imagine. The MacBook Air and a horde of ultrabook clones are hitting a brick wall in terms of form and physics. The tablet, likewise, isn't exactly pushing civilization forward; it's still fundamentally a luxury device, a delightful toy for reading email on the couch or watching Netflix on an airplane. Nobody needs a tablet. It's a lovely, superfluous thing. But everyone needs a computer, unless you're planning on living by a lake and trading furs for a living. \n \n Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF \n \n Advertisement \n \n Microsoft's pearly promise for Surface was to pioneer a strange new kind of gadget: all the grace and leisure of a tablet, combined with the ability to actually make stuff that a computer brings. Convenience with input. Type, edit, change. Work. Power! Microsoft claims outright that Surface will bring together the best of everything that exists\u2014the elusive union of laptop and tablet. Or at the very least, with Surface RT, a tablet that you could actually use as your primary computer. \n \n The men who built the Surface from a pile of cardboard prototypes into the thing I've been using for the past week stood in front of me at their headquarters and said exactly that. Microsoft is trumpeting a historical change here. And it has a recent track record of building exceptional things. Sure, there's a Surface Pro version coming up that'll have full, powerful laptop guts, and run the same software any PC can\u2014Microsoft's best shot at being your only computer, forever. But even this RT variant is supposed to give us some overdue synthesis. Plop it down on your desk and get things done. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF \n \n Whether Microsoft can keep this promise matters more than anything else in technology this year. Surface could be the blueprint for the machine you'll be typing on well into the next decade. No pressure. \n \n Using it \n \n Surface is Microsoft's attempt to out-Apple Apple. The thing is designed to hell and back, and most of the time it shows. This means a lot of attention to detail\u2014attention that sounds silly until you actually hear it\u2014like the kickstand with an extra, custom-designed hinge to guarantee a satisfying chkkk every time it's snapped shut. Is that superficial? Only if you consider something you're going to potentially hear and touch multiple times every single day superficial. Otherwise, it's just damn thoughtful. \n \n Advertisement \n \n And most of the time, Surface is a thoughtful computer. It's a beautiful computer, in your hand or on a tabletop, its shifting angles clean and secure like a Danish prison. It's a little too heavy\u2014slightly heftier than the iPad 3\u2014but otherwise comfortable to hold, with an angled bezel that melts into your hand. There's a convenient USB port that, unlike other tablets, doesn't look like a gaping open sore on the delicately chamfered side. The screen doesn't hold up against the crispness of the iPad's retina resolution, but still manages a lovely colorful pop to suit the colorful, poppy Windows 8. All over the Surface, these little details reflect the meeting of large brains. \n \n But more importantly, Surface is handsome. That ineffable Hey, this thing feels good quality is lacquered all over Surface. You'll appreciate it every time you pick it up and turn it on. It's a simple, joyful experience. Open the Touch Cover keyboard/trackpad hybrid, snap out the kickstand, and lay the thing on your desk like a laptop. Start writing an essay. Flip the cover all the way around, hide the keyboard, and give yourself something substantial to grip like a tablet. Start swiping the web. Or prop the kickstand against the folded-back cover to create a stable base while you watch Netflix on a coffee table. Switching configurations is a cinch, and it's entirely intuitive. The Touch Cover feels as integral to the Surface as the binding of a book to the sandwiched pages. There's every reason to believe most computers will look and feel something like this, someday soon. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Like \n \n The Surface is instantly more charming than any Windows device that's come before it. It's nearly the perfect size, and the form is almost beyond reproach. If you want a tablet, use it like a tablet. If you want a laptop, use it like a laptop. Both modes seem right, like a genuine seachange step forward. The Next Kind of Computer can be slipped in a bag, power up a bright display nearly instantly, run an operating system that loves being touched, and equally importantly, have a keyboard you can use to actually get work done. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Tablets aren't for work. That's the old refrain. But if they're going to be more than great toys someday, tablets have to become every bit as viable as a desktop tower as a way to write (and edit) long emails, presentations, and poems. Surface RT is the first evidence we have that this is possible, because you'll use it like you've never used any computer before. Your brain starts to rewire itself, and it's delightful. \n \n Flip out the keyboard. Hit power. Swipe up to unlock. Type in your password. A dozen super-colorful tiles give you a snappy report of what's new: Who's tweeted at you, what's arrived in your inbox, news headlines, photos of your beautiful face, and incoming Facebook IMs, as they drop. You'll touch one thing, scroll to the next, swipe another, then begin typing, merging habits you've picked up since your parents first let you set hands on something that ran off batteries. Surface presents you the Internet all at once. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Browsing in Internet Explorer is just as easy a flopping into a couch-cushion Netflix marathon, or working in the full Microsoft Office suite. It all feels seamless, natural, a culmination of useful things. This ease, the effortless transfer between watching stuff and making stuff, reading and writing, listening and talking, it permeates Surface with the mark of The New Computer. This is what netbooks were supposed to be, before we realized they were all completely horrible: small, powerful, flexible, skinny computers that can do a ton of things easily. \n \n You can thank Windows 8's radicalism for that. Traditional Windows would be absolute hell to use on this\u2014or hey, so would OS X. But Metro is the best foundation for The Next Computer I can imagine, and if you can get over UI squeamishness, you'll love it. It'll make you more powerful the more you rub your hands on it. It is that good. Or at least it could be, at some point. \n \n No Like \n \n We're not there yet. Surface is a fantastic promise, and holds fantastic potential. But while potential is worth your attention, it's not worth your paycheck. Surface RT gets so many things right, and pulls so many good things together into one package. But it is undercooked. For all Microsoft's claims to hardware perfection and software revolution, Surface RT is undone by too many little annoyances, cracks, and flaws. After the initial delight of an evolved tablet wears off, you'll groan\u2014because Surface brings the appearance of unity, but it's really just the worst of both worlds. Instead of trading in your laptop and tablet for Surface, a cocktail of compromises that fracture the whole endeavor, you'll miss them both urgently. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Want to use Surface RT as a laptop? Sorry, the Touch Cover is a letdown. It's a phenomenal engineering effort, and the most terrifically-integrated mobile keyboard ever. It doesn't compare to the junky Bluetooth options you can slap against your iPad. Microsoft's keyboard cover is perfectly integrated with the device, and touch typing on it is actually possible. You can't say the same for the iPad's glass. \n \n Your browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF \n \n But it only approximates a real keyboard\u2014the buttons are pressure activated, barely buttons at all, and spaced in such a way that typos are inevitable and constant. Unlike the first time you pinched an iPhone or gazed at E-ink, there's zero that's instantly intuitive about the Touch Cover. And in order for this to be a brave new computer, Touch Cover had to be instantly intuitive, an immediately responsive thing to touch and work with. But rather than feeling like you've instantly grown an extra brain lobe just by using it, Surface's mega-hyped keyboard cover feels like it requires one. You'll feel clumsy. You'll write slowly. I tried writing this review on the Surface, but I would've missed my deadline by a week. You'll get better\u2014it will probably take weeks to hit a stride\u2014but this thing was supposed to be a breakthrough. A perfect interface. Instead, it's just a half-broken death march up the learning curve. The trackpad, sludge-like and jerky, is even worse\u2014particularly galling compared to the super-smooth touchscreen\u2014and unlike the keyboard, will never get better with practice. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The Touch Cover also approximates, dismally, the sturdiness of a laptop: thanks to the cloth-like floppiness of the thing that's necessary for making it easy to open and close, it can't support itself on anything but a flat, rigid (apologies) surface. You can't type on your lap, like laptop. It's hard to imagine what a design solution out of this would have been, but that's Microsoft's job, not ours. \n \n Perhaps most galling is the Touch Cover's $100 addition to the Surface's already pricy $400 base MSRP\u2014akin to selling your windshield wipers separate from the car. Microsoft also offers a Type Cover, that promises actual physical keys instead of the flattened solution, but that will add critical bulk to your Surface experience\u2014along with an extra $130. Another letdown\u2014and a pretty outrageous one. \n \n But it's Windows on Surface RT that's the greatest letdown of all, the lethal letdown, because it's not Windows 8, but Windows RT. You can't tell the difference by looking at them, but you certainly will once you use it. Windows RT is underpowered (everything opens and syncs slightly too slowly), under-functional (you cannot install a single app that's not available through the Windows RT app store, which offers a paltry selection), and under-planned (the built-in apps can't feel like Lite versions of something better). You'd be right to note that many of those limitations apply to the iPad as well, but no one could mistake iOS for OS X the way RT apes Windows 8. And even if it's a plight common to tablets, Microsoft\u2014for better or worse\u2014has hyped Surface RT as being so much more. \n \n Advertisement \n \n In the end though, this is nothing more than Microsoft's tablet. And a buggy, at times broken one, at that, whose \"ecosystem\" feels more like a tundra. There's no Twitter or Facebook app, and the most popular 3rd party client breaks often. The Kindle app is completely unusable. There's no image editing software. A People app is supposed to give you all the social media access you'd ever need, but It's impossible to write on someone's Facebook wall through the People app, Surface's social hub; the only workaround is to load Internet Explorer. Blech. Something as simple as loading a video requires a jumbled process of USB importing, dipping in and out of the stripped-down desktop mode, opening a Video app, importing, going back into the Video app, and then playing. What. \n \n The app selection, overall, is worse than the already pathetic Windows Phone app fare, looking like the software equivalent to a barren Soviet grocery store. The difference is that Windows Phone, used in quick, informative bursts, skates by on the strength of its excellent with integrated features. At the moment, there's just not that much to do with Microsoft's \u00fcber-tablet. Surface is weak because Windows RT is weak; a tepid tablet OS pretending to be a computer's. \n \n Advertisement \n \n You can do work, yes. But productivity is limited to a \"preview\" (beta) version of Microsoft Office. It also hurts that Office requires plunging into Windows RT's Desktop mode, where users of actual Windows 8 are able to install a decade's worth of legacy software. Normally, this would compensate. But RT users can't install any of this older software. None of it. Desktop mode is entirely worthless in RT, a cruel tease of non-functionality. It'll only remind you of how much you can't do with your Surface, and is going to confuse the living hell out of most people who buy one\u2014especially when Surface Pro, built on x86 architecture and perfectly compatible with all of those legacy programs, steps in a few months from now. \n \n I pity Microsoft's retail staff. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Should you buy it? \n \n No. The Surface, with an obligatory Touch Cover, is $600. That's a lot of money. Especially given that it's no laptop replacement, no matter how it looks or what Microsoft says. It's a tablet-plus, priced right alongside the iPad and in most ways inferior. \n \n That could change. Maybe there will be a new Touch Cover that retains the original's terrific physical qualities while actually allowing good typing. Maybe the quasi-vaporware Surface Pro, which eschews Windows RT in favor of the real-deal Win 8, will make all the difference, opening itself up to the open seas of PC software (for several hundred dollars more). Maybe the app store will look different in a month, or a year, and have anything to offer. Maybe. But remember that Windows Phone\u2014which has swelled from mere hundreds, to tens of thousands, to over a hundred thousand app offerings over the past two years\u2014is still a wasteland compared to iOS and Android. Poor precedent. Maybe Windows RT will be different. Maybe. \n \n Advertisement \n \n But those maybes aren't worth putting money on. As much as it looked (and even felt) like it for a bit, the future isn't here quite yet. \n \n \n \n Microsoft Surface Stats \n \n Price: $500, $130 extra for Touch Cover \n \n Screen: 10.6-inches, 1366x768 pixels (16:9) \n \n Processor: 1.3 GHz Quad Core Tegra 3 \n \n Storage: 32 GB, microSDXC expandable \n \n Wi-Fi: 802.11b/g/n \n \n RAM: 2 GB \n \n Connectivity: 1 USB 2.0 port, HD video out \n \n Weight: 1.5 Pounds \n \n Dimensions: 10.81 x 6.77 x 0.37 inches \n \n Battery: 8 hours reading/7.5 video (advertised) \n \n Gizrank: 2.5 ||||| Story highlights Microsoft's first tablet is beautifully designed outside but software still needs work \n \n One of the device's weakness is its small app selection \n \n The Surface starts at $499 for a 32GB model \n \n When Microsoft first demoed Windows 8 at the Wall Street Journal's D Conference in June 2011 , it was instantly obvious that it wasn't a Windows upgrade in the conventional sense. Instead, with its radically new, touch-centric interface, it was an attempt to reimagine the PC for the post-PC era. A wildly ambitious attempt \u2014 maybe even a visionary one. \n \n But for all Microsoft's power and influence over the PC industry, it was in no place to reinvent the PC single-handedly. Sure, it could write a new operating system. It could also make suggestions to its hardware-manufacturing partners, But it couldn't, you know, try to build the PC of the future. \n \n Except that it did. \n \n In June of this year, the company unveiled Surface , a pair of tablets it designed from scratch. (One, Surface with Windows RT, runs Windows RT, the version for devices based on ARM technology; the other, Surface with Windows 8 Pro, uses full-blown Windows 8 and isn't due until early next year.) They're iPad competitors, and that's important. But they're also PCs \u2014 the first ones that Microsoft has created on its own in its 37-year history. As such, they're the clearest possible expression of where the company thinks the PC should go. \n \n Surface for Windows RT goes on sale at Microsoft Stores and some temporary pop-up retail outlets, and at Microsoft.com , this Friday. It starts at $499 for a 32GB model: the same opening price as the current full-sized iPad, but with double the storage. Microsoft provided me with a unit for this review, and I've been using it for a little over a week. \n \n If you were excited by Surface based on its unveiling in June of this year , I think there's a good chance you'll be excited by the shipping product. And if the idea left you skeptical \u2014 well, you probably won't be won over by this initial incarnation. \n \n At that June Surface event \u2014 and then at a smaller press briefing at its Redmond, Washington, headquarters last week \u2014 company executives spent so much time lavishing praise on their own design choices and technical innovations that I wondered if they'd somehow convinced Apple's Sir Jonathan Ive to tutor them. \n \n It turns out that much of the self-laudatory hoopla wasn't wildly off base. The Surface hardware is indeed a beautiful piece of work, one that's worthy of comparison to Apple's designs even though many of Microsoft's specific choices are distinctly un-Applelike. \n \n Its slate-colored magnesium case, manufactured using a process Microsoft calls VaporMg, is really, really nice. It's good-looking, it's sturdy and it helps keep the weight down \u2014 Surface is only slightly heavier than the iPad at 1.5 pounds, even though it has got a substantially roomier 10.6\u2033 screen. Microsoft also says that the case is pretty much scratchproof, though you might want to be careful about tossing the tablet in a backpack: I noticed that the Windows logo on the backside of my review unit began scraping off almost immediately. \n \n Surface has a kickstand \u2014 a fold-out flap on the back, which, when used in conjunction with a keyboard cover I'll talk about in a bit, lets you use the tablet like an undersized laptop. The care that Microsoft poured into it shows: When it's closed it's flush with the rest of the case and when it's open it keeps the tablet perfectly stable. And the hinge has a luxe feel, reminiscent of the high-end car door Microsoft says was its inspiration. \n \n (I just said that you can use Surface like a laptop, but when I first saw it, I wondered if the kickstand would prevent you from using it in your lap at all. Not in my experience: I was able to balance it and the keyboard cover on my thigh without worrying too much about the whole contraption tipping over.) \n \n That 10.6\u2033 screen has 1366 by 768 pixels; Microsoft used its ClearType technology to improve text display, and glued the touchscreen directly on the LCD, which makes for a thinner, less reflective display. At the Redmond press event, a Microsoft engineer argued that despite the lower resolution, the screen beats the iPad's 2048 by 1536 Retina display in some circumstances; he also said that people who are 45 and above generally can't tell a Retina screen from a lower-resolution one. \n \n My 48-year-old eyeballs have no trouble telling the difference between iPad Retina text and the Surface's ClearType \u2014 but overall, the Surface's screen is one of the best I've seen on a tablet. \n \n The screen, incidentally, is 16:9, an aspect ratio designed with Windows 8\u2032s panoramic interface in mind. It lets you see more apps without panning, and is well suited to the feature that allows you to snap a widget-like version of one app on the side of the primary program you're using. Microsoft thinks Surface buyers will use the tablet mostly in landscape mode; it works in portrait orientation too, although the aspect ratio leaves it looking like a small-but-tall magazine. \n \n Surface has basic cameras on the front and back, as you'd expect from any $499 tablet. It also has a USB port and a MicroSDXC slot that lets you add extra storage, two features that add to its PC-like personality. Microsoft doesn't seem to be making a claim about battery life except to say that the tablet is designed for \"all day\" use, and in my time with it, it lived up to that vague claim. \n \n One minor nit about the hardware: I found that I needed to wriggle the magnetic power connector into place in a way I don't with Apple's MagSafe connectors or even run-of-the-mill, nonmagnetic ones. \n \n So that's Surface's basic hardware \u2014 not flawless, but darn nifty overall. If it ran Android, people might well conclude that it was the best Android tablet on the market. \n \n But this tablet is defined by its operating system: Windows RT. \n \n Despite the lack of an \"8\u2033 in its moniker, RT has precisely the same user interface as Windows 8. It has the colorful Start screen with auto-updating Live Tiles, each leading to an app or service. It runs the same bundled Windows 8-interface apps: Internet Explorer, Bing, e-mail, a calendar, a news app and more. Everything's touch-friendly and fluid. It's not the Windows we've known, but it's a good start on an interface that might carry Microsoft through the next couple of decades of computing. \n \n Like Windows 8, RT has the Desktop, an area that's essentially Windows 7, except without the Start button. As with Windows 8, switching back and forth between new Windows 8-style apps and the Desktop can be an oddly disjointed experience, as if you're teleporting between two very different planets with very little warning. \n \n On Windows 8, the Desktop has a huge saving grace: It lets you use any old-school Windows program. Windows RT, however, can't run them. They were all written for computers based on x86 (Intel) technology, and are incompatible with Surface's ARM processor. \n \n So why is Desktop there at all? Mostly to run four Microsoft Office 2013 programs: Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook. All come bundled with Surface, and all are largely identical to their Windows 8 counterparts, despite being \"preview\" editions. (Surface buyers will get the final versions free.) \n \n Anyone who's ever struggled to get work done on a tablet with a stripped-down office suite in a Microsoft Office world will appreciate certain things about Surface's Office apps. They support the official Office file formats perfectly and have industrial-strength features such as Word's revision tracking. \n \n Still, I found them the least satisfying thing about Surface. They're the one part of this product Microsoft hasn't reimagined. Instead, it has just tweaked the apps slightly, giving them a Windows 8-type look in certain areas and rejiggering everything else to make it slightly easier to use with a fingertip rather than with a mouse. They work, but the whole experience feels like an exercise in compromise. (I have my fingers crossed that Microsoft has a real Windows 8-style version of Office in the works.) \n \n If you plan to use Office much, you'll certainly want one of Microsoft's keyboard covers; the Touch Cover isn't included with the base $499 Surface, but a black model comes with the $599 version, and additional colors are available for $119.99 apiece. Snap one on, using the magnetic connector, and the Start screen automatically changes color to match \u2014 pretty stylish. \n \n The Touch Cover is super-thin and clicks on and off in a jiffy. (I did find that I occasionally had to remove it and reclick to make it work.) The keyboard's on the inside and draws power from the connector; there's no need to futz with Bluetooth or worry about charging it. The nonkeyboard side has a fleecy surface that feels great in your hand, and the whole thing folds back. \n \n When I first saw this cover in June, I kept an open mind about it. In fact, my mind was so open that I wondered if Microsoft had managed to produce a flat, one-piece keyboard that wouldn't leave many people pining for clacky mechanical keys. \n \n Actually, even at the June event, the company had tipped its hand: It also showed off the Type Cover, which is much like the Touch Cover except that it has discrete keys with real travel. If the Touch Cover had been a miracle, there wouldn't have been a need for the Type Cover. \n \n But if your benchmark is on-screen keyboards rather than conventional physical ones, you might be tickled with the Touch Cover. The keys are surprisingly spacious and there's no need to fumble through multiple modes to get to digits and punctuation. More important, moving the keyboard off the screen frees up the full screen resolution for whatever app you're using \u2014 a plus in all scenarios, and close to a necessity with the Desktop Office apps, all of which work better when they don't have an on-screen keyboard in the way. \n \n As with any unfamiliar input device, I got more comfortable with the Touch Cover as I used it. But if I were buying a Surface to use for anything other than extremely light productivity, I'd spring for the $129.99 Type Cover instead. It's also impressively thin, but comes infinitely closer to a notebook-like feel. \n \n Both the Touch Cover and the Type Cover sport a tiny touchpad. It's approximately the size of an unfolded matchbook, and I found it adequate in a pinch, but nowhere near as nice as a full-sized touchpad on a full-sized notebook. (With the Windows 8 experience, the bigger the touchpad, the better the experience.) With a cover on, I tended to do as much as possible from the keyboard, and simply touch the screen otherwise. \n \n With Office and a Desktop version of Internet Explorer as Surface for Windows RT's only major traditional-Windows apps, anyone who plunks down $499 or more for a Surface today will be largely dependent on Microsoft's Windows Store for software. That's the biggest gamble such buyers are making. Windows 8 is launching with 5,000 apps in the U.S. version of the Windows Store, most of which should be available for Windows RT; they include name-brand wares such as Evernote, Hulu, Netflix, Microsoft's own Skype, TuneIn, a bunch of games and more. \n \n Many of the Windows RT apps I tried make smart use of the Windows 8-style interface. Compared to the 275,000 iPad-optimized apps in Apple's store, though, there simply isn't much there. If Surface's earliest adopters are pleased with their purchase a year from now, it'll be because the Windows Store's offerings got beefier fast; if they're nonplussed, it'll be because the selection remained too meager. \n \n All of which leads to one question: Who should consider buying a Surface with Windows RT? Not anyone who wants the most fully fleshed-out tablet experience right now \u2014 for that, the iPad still has no rival. \n \n Surface offers slick industrial design, an inventive interface, full-blown Office apps that haven't been truly optimized for tablets and two very clever keyboard options. If part or all of that proposition appeals to you \u2014 and you're optimistic about the Windows Store \u2014 this tablet is worth a look. For an audacious version 1.0 product, it's impressive. Now it's up to Microsoft to prove that it's serious enough about this PC business to forge ahead with Surface until it's impressive, period. ||||| It has ports and jacks that iPad owners can only dream about: a memory-card slot to expand the storage, a video output jack and a USB 2.0 jack. You can connect almost any USB device: keyboard, mouse, flash drive, speakers, hard drive and so on. \n \n Each Surface model has double the storage of the same-price iPad. For example, the $500 Surface offers 32 gigabytes; the 64-gig Surface is $600. \n \n There are some disappointments on the spec sheet. The battery life is advertised as eight to 10 hours, less than the iPad. There\u2019s no cellular version; it\u2019s Wi-Fi only. The screen is very sharp (1,366 by 768 pixels), but it doesn\u2019t approach the iPad\u2019s Retina screen clarity (2,048 by 1,536 pixels). \n \n And you can charge the Surface only from its wall adapter \u2014 not from a computer\u2019s USB jack. Microsoft\u2019s reasoning is that you won\u2019t have a computer to charge from, since your days of carrying both a tablet and a laptop are over. Besides, a wall outlet recharges far faster than USB can. \n \n The front is all touch screen. The edges of the black magnesium body are angled and crisp, like a prop from a Batman movie. \n \n Then there\u2019s the kickstand. The lower half of the back is a hinged panel, held shut magnetically until you pop it out with a fingernail. It snaps to a 22-degree angle, ready to prop the tablet sturdily upright. \n \n A lesser kickstand would add weight, bulk or ugliness. But this one is razor-thin and disappears completely when you\u2019re not using it. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n You do use it, though \u2014 especially when you flip open the optional keyboard. \n \n Yes, keyboard. You know Apple\u2019s magnetically hinged iPad cover? Microsoft\u2019s Touch Cover is the same idea \u2014 same magnet hinge \u2014 except that on the inside, there are key shapes, and even a trackpad, formed from slightly raised, fuzzy material. Flip the cover open, flip out the kickstand and boom: you have what amounts to a 1.5-pound PC that sets up anywhere. \n \n This is nothing like those Bluetooth keyboard cases for the iPad. First, the Touch Cover is much, much thinner, 0.13 inches, cardboard thin. Second, it\u2019s not Bluetooth; there\u2019s no setup and no battery hit. The magnet clicks, and keyboard is ready for typing. Third, when you want just a tablet, the keyboard flips around against the back. The Surface automatically disables its keys and displays the on-screen keyboard when it\u2019s time to type. \n \n Photo \n \n You can buy this cover, in a choice of colors, with the Surface for $100, or later for $120. \n \n It\u2019s an incredibly slick idea, but the keys don\u2019t move. You\u2019re pounding a flat surface. If you type too fast, the keyboard skips letters. (\u201cIf you type 80 words a minute on a keyboard and 20-30 on glass, you should be in the 50s on the Touch Cover,\u201d says a Microsoft representative.) \n \n Fortunately, Microsoft also offers the Type Cover ($130), with real keys that really travel. At 0.24 inches thick, it\u2019s not as unnoticeable as the Touch Cover, but Microsoft says it\u2019s the thinnest moving-keys keyboard on earth, and it types nicely. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Now the heartbreak: software. \n \n This computer runs Windows RT, a variation of Windows 8, which Microsoft hopes will run on all PCs from now on. RT is wildly different from the old Windows. You\u2019ll be thrilled or appalled, depending on your fondness for change. \n \n In this Windows, the Start screen is a patchwork of colorful, interactive tiles. You tap one to open an app, swipe down on one to \u201cright click\u201d it, swipe across to reveal more pages of them. Each tile is also a tiny dashboard, showing your next appointment, latest Facebook post, today\u2019s weather and so on. It\u2019s fast, fluid and fun to use. \n \n Swiping in from the edges of the screen summons useful hidden panels. Swipe in from the top or bottom to reveal your app\u2019s menus; from the left to switch apps; from the right for important controls like Share and Settings. \n \n Unfortunately, Windows RT is not the full Windows. The Surface comes with preview 2013 versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint \u2014 workable, but sometimes sluggish. \n \n Otherwise, though, Windows RT can\u2019t run any of the four million regular Windows programs. Or the 275,000 iPad apps. Or the 17 Android tablet apps. (That\u2019s a joke! There are actually 19 Android tablet apps.) \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Instead, it requires all new apps. They\u2019re available exclusively from the online Windows App Store, and there aren\u2019t many to choose from; for example, there\u2019s no Facebook, Spotify, Angry Birds, Instagram, Draw Something or New York Times app. The total in the United States is about 3,500 apps so far; many are bare-bones or junky. \n \n In some ways, the far more intriguing prospect is the Surface Pro tablet, which Microsoft says will be available in 90 days. It has a real Intel chip inside, and can run real Windows programs. That\u2019s right: Photoshop, iTunes, Quicken and classic PC games on your tablet. \n \n The Pro will be heavier (two pounds), thicker (half an inch) and much more expensive (around $1,000). For those sacrifices, of course, you could buy an ultrathin laptop \u2014 but the Surface\u2019s keyboard cover and touch screen make it far more flexible. \n \n But both Surface tablets, and indeed Windows 8 itself, suffer from an insanely confusing split personality. Beneath the colorful, edge-to-edge world of RT apps, the menus, icons, taskbar and overlapping windows of the traditional Windows desktop are still there. On the Surface, that old desktop pops bafflingly and unnecessarily into view whenever you use the Office programs. \n \n (My complete review of Windows 8 will appear in The New York Times on Thursday.) \n \n That\u2019s not all that\u2019s wrong with Windows RT, either. There\u2019s no speech recognition, let alone Siri; no app folders; no automated guidance in Maps. The Control Panel offers features like typing suggestions and autocorrect, but I couldn\u2019t get them to work anywhere. Sometimes the on-screen keyboard doesn\u2019t pop up when it\u2019s supposed to. \n \n Little inconsistencies and bafflements are everywhere. Such as the way Word constantly informs me that \u201cthere is insufficient memory or disk space.\u201d (Well, gee, Microsoft \u2014 whose fault is that?) \n \n Look, here\u2019s the thing. You\u2019d have to be fairly coldblooded to keep your pulse down the first time you see the Surface: its beauty, its potential, its instant transformation from tablet to PC. How incredible that this bold, envelope-pushing design came from Microsoft, a company that for years produced only feeble imitations of other companies\u2019 fresh ideas. \n \n And how ironic that what lets the Surface down is supposedly Microsoft\u2019s specialty: software. \n \n In time, maybe the Windows RT apps will come. Maybe the snags will get fixed. Maybe people will solve the superimposed puzzle of Windows RT and Windows 8. Until then, the Surface is a brilliantly conceived machine whose hardware will take your breath away \u2014 but whose software will take away your patience. ||||| Nobody asked me about my Surface. I tried flashing it all over the place. But despite my best efforts, no one seemed curious. \n \n At Victrola Coffee Roasters in Seattle, I sat in the front window, with a hot pink Touch Cover attached, intentionally conspicuous. Nobody mentioned it. At the airport, I broke it out at the large open-air counter of a crowded bar. I sat in a seat at the gate, facing the walkway, pounding away at its keys on my lap. On a Virgin America flight, crowded with techies, I sat up front and kept it on my tray table the entire time, swiping from app to app. On San Francisco\u2019s Muni transit system, I tentatively typed in my seat, afraid it may be snatched on the crowded train. But no one said a word. \n \n The only person to comment on it was a TSA agent at the Seattle airport, who told me I didn\u2019t need to take my iPad out of my bag. \n \n That\u2019s too bad. Although nobody asked, Microsoft\u2019s new tablet is an altogether curious device. It\u2019s something completely new and different. It is, in some ways, better than an iPad. In some ways, worse. It\u2019s brilliant, and yet it can be puzzling as well. Confoundingly so at times. It\u2019s a tablet of both compromises and confusion. It is a true hybrid \u2014 neither fully a desktop nor mobile device. That\u2019s reflected in all sorts of ways. It is Wi-Fi only, but won\u2019t run traditional Windows applications. It has a full-featured keyboard and runs Microsoft Office \u2014 but it\u2019s certainly meant to be touched and swiped and tapped. \n \n It\u2019s different. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Let\u2019s at least get this out of the way: This is one of the most exciting pieces of hardware I\u2019ve ever used. It is extremely well-designed; meticulous even. \n \n The backside kickstand can serve as a metaphor for the entire device. Close it, and it sits flush with the back of the tablet. It\u2019s so tightly integrated, if you didn\u2019t know it was there, you\u2019d think it was just a seam for the battery compartment. It has three hinges \u2014 one of which is just to give it a satisfying sound when opening or closing. (Snap!) It\u2019s designed to be like a car door. It\u2019s designed to make you use it. \n \n And it\u2019s quite sturdy, to boot. In Microsoft\u2019s lab, we saw Surfaces that had been opened and closed hundreds of thousands of times. They still snapped open and shut like they were new. We wanted to see how easy it was to break one. It\u2019s very possible, but you have to really try. We did manage to break off the kickstand by gradually leaning onto it, but I had to put nearly my full weight onto the tablet before the kickstand snapped off. \n \n \n \n \n \n People will break the hinge, but I don\u2019t think as often or predictably as, say, the glass rear panel of an iPhone 4 or 4S. One other nitpick? The kickstand has a small fingerhold to make it easy to open. But this is on the left-hand side of the device. Most people are right-handed. \n \n And then there is the 3-millimeter-thin Touch Cover keyboard. Ever since Microsoft first unveiled the Surface, this has been a big question mark. Does it really snap on and off so easily? Is it usable? Does it even work? Yes. To everything. It\u2019s actually quite fantastic. On this miniature keyboard, that has no actual physical keys, keystrokes fire as fast as you can type them. There is no lag. There is, however, a learning curve. \n \n I struggled mightily with typos and finger placement for the first 24 hours. My left wrist hurt like hell. The pinkie and ring finger on my left hand were cramped. But by day three, my hands began to relax and I was typing quickly and, for the most part, accurately. After a week, I powered along at 90 words per minute. It\u2019s not the same speed I hit on a full size keyboard, and I still have typos galore (though far fewer) but given how much I\u2019ve improved in a week, it\u2019s impressive. \n \n Oddly, it is perhaps less effective as a cover than a keyboard. It folds over nicely, but doesn\u2019t stay closed as well as I\u2019d like. Several times, I opened my bag to a glow, like something out of Pulp Fiction, to find the Surface had lit up as the Touch Cover came open inside. \n \n The Type Cover ($130, sold separately), which has actual keys, performs even more poorly as a cover, but it\u2019s a spectacular keyboard. I could hammer away on it at approximately normal speed from the get-go, and made fewer typos. \n \n One issue I did have with the Type Cover was the accidental pressing of a key. Apparently, at some point I pressed the Shift key for eight seconds, which launched a Filter Keys setting \u2014 an accessibility feature meant for users with palsy and other disabilities that may cause them to inadvertently press keys. From that moment on, the keyboard basically did not work. And because Windows 8 and Windows RT are so cloud-connected, this setting propagated itself across all my other Windows devices. It was an easy fix, and Microsoft says a software update that prevents this from happening is on the way. But I thought it spoke to how easy it can be to inadvertently do bad things with the Type Cover. \n \n The 720p HD cameras \u2014 front and rear \u2014 are junk. There\u2019s no other way to put it. The camera has a significant lag time when you\u2019re taking shots, and the image quality looks about like the last photo you snapped with your Razr V3. It should be, however, fine for Skype. Just don\u2019t expect Nana and Papa to be able to see their little grunions clearly. \n \n Pages: 1 2 3 View All",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The creators of the hotly anticipated Microsoft Surface RT have touted it as revolutionary, improving upon the toy-like tablets of today by making it functional, with a detachable touch screen and a snappy design. So is it the future of computing? Not yet, most reviewers agree: Sam Biddle praises the RT's concept and design in a detailed review at Gizmodo that's worth a full read. But ultimately, he says it's \"not worth your paycheck\" in its current form, which retails around $600 give or take some pricey add-ons. Instead of being both a tablet and a laptop, it's \"really just the worst of both worlds.\" It's also hard to use: \"It's just a half-broken death march up the learning curve.\" Over at Wired, Mathew Honan loves the look of the machine, and like others, drools over the satisfying \"snap\" of its razor-thin kickstand. It's durable too, but the cameras lag and \"the image quality looks about like the last photo you snapped with your Razr V3.\" Pretty much everyone hates the Windows RT software the machine runs on. It's a departure from Window's old operating systems\u2014it's colorful and swipe-friendly, for starters. But Harry McCracken, writing for CNN, wonders why the new design still includes a desktop. Switching between the two interfaces \"can be an oddly disjointed experience, as if you're teleporting between two very different planets with very little warning.\" The apps are a big letdown, writes David Pogue in the New York Times. You can't use any iPad or Android Tablet apps, nor any of Microsoft's own programs. That means no apps for Facebook, Angry Birds, or Spotify, among many others, and what is available is \"bare-bones junky.\" His advice? Wait a few months for the Surface Pro.",

    "document": "Archaeologists have uncovered a mysterious enclosure hidden deep inside the Great Pyramid of Giza, the oldest of the seven wonders of the ancient world. \n \n The massive cavity stretches for at least 30 metres and lies above the grand gallery, an impressive ascending corridor that connects the Queen\u2019s chamber to the King\u2019s in the heart of the historic monument. It is the first major structure found in the pyramid since the 19th century. \n \n It is unclear whether the void is a chamber or a corridor, or whether it played any more than a structural role in the pyramid\u2019s construction \u2013 such as relieving weight on the grand gallery below. But measurements show that it has similar dimensions to the grand gallery, which is nearly 50 metres long, eight metres high and more than a metre wide. \n \n Scientists discovered the void using sensors that detect particles known as muons, which rain down on Earth when cosmic rays slam into atoms in the upper atmosphere. The muons travel at close to the speed of light and behave much like x-rays when they meet objects. Armed with suitable equipment, researchers can used them to reveal the rough internal structure of pyramids and other ancient monuments. \n \n \u201cWe know that this big void has the same characteristics as the grand gallery,\u201d said Mehdi Tayoubi at the HIP Institute in Paris, a non-profit organisation that draws on new technology to study and preserve cultural heritage. \u201cIt\u2019s really impressive.\u201d \n \n Tomb raiders: what treasures could lurk inside Egypt's lost chambers? Read more \n \n Also known as Khufu\u2019s Pyramid, or the Pyramid of Cheops, the Great Pyramid was built in the 4th dynasty by the pharaoh Khufu, who reigned from 2509 to 2483 BC. The monument rises 140 metres above the Giza Plateau and has three chambers known from previous explorations: a subterranean one at the base of the pyramid, the Queen\u2019s chamber at the centre, and the King\u2019s chamber above. While a granite sarcophagus sits in the King\u2019s chamber, King Khufu\u2019s mummy is missing, and his queens were buried elsewhere. Whatever riches were once in the chambers were looted long ago. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest The ScanPyramids team examining an augmented reality review of the newly-discovered void. Photograph: ScanPyramids mission \n \n Egyptologists have scores of theories about how the pyramid was built, but there are no reliable accounts of its construction. Herodotus wrote of stones being drawn from quarries near and far, with some being shipped down the Nile on boats. The mammoth construction project occupied the lives of a hundred thousand men, fuelled in part by radishes, onions and leeks, he noted. \n \n To pinpoint the cavity, scientists from Nagoya University in Japan, and KEK, the country\u2019s high energy physics lab, installed muon-detecting photographic plates and electronic muon detectors around the Queen\u2019s chamber. At the same time, researchers from CEA, France\u2019s energy research organisation, trained \u201cmuon telescopes\u201d on the pyramid from the outside. All three techniques can tell from which direction incoming muons arrive. \n \n When the teams compared their results, all had found a muon hotspot in the same place, indicating the presence of a large cavity in the pyramid. While most of the monument is made of stone that absorbs muons, chambers and cavities let the particles pass through. \n \n Great Pyramid tombs unearth 'proof' workers were not slaves Read more \n \n Muon analysis allows scientists to look deep inside ancient monuments without drilling holes or causing other damage to the precious structures. But the technique produces low resolution images, making it impossible for the researchers to tell if the newly-found void runs horizontally or parallel to the grand gallery. Nor can they be sure it is a single enclosure rather than a series of smaller cavities close together, they report in Nature. \n \n \u201cWhat we are sure about is that this big void is there, that it is impressive, and was not expected by any kind of theory,\u201d said Tayoubi. To shed more light on the purpose of the cavity, Tayoubi called on specialists in ancient Egyptian architecture to come forward with ideas of what it may be so they can be modelled and checked against the team\u2019s data. The cavity may have relieved weight on the roof of the underlying grand gallery, or be a hitherto unknown corridor in the pyramid. The team has no plans to drill into the cavity to explore inside, but they are developing a tiny flying robot that might one day be sent in, if the Egyptian authorities approve. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to humankind,\u201d said Tayoubi of the pyramid. \u201cIt asks a question about what is our future. If they have been able to do this with the means they had 4,000 or 5,000 years ago and they left this heritage today, what will our own society leave for future generations?\u201d \n \n Peter Der Manuelian, professor of Egyptology and director of the Harvard Semitic Museum, said the discovery was \u201cpotentially a major contribution to our knowledge about the Great Pyramid.\u201d \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest Researchers using muon detectors discover a void in the Great Pyramid of Giza. Credit: ScanPyramids mission \n \n \u201cI\u2019m sure there are imperfections and perhaps small voids or cavities in several locations in the pyramid. What makes this one so interesting is the size, seeming to rival the grand gallery itself in scale,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cThe muons can\u2019t tell us about chambers, form, size, or any possible objects, so it\u2019s far too early to speculate. I know most people want to know about hidden chambers, grave goods, and the missing mummy of King Khufu. None of that is on the table at this point. But the fact that this void is so large warrants further non-invasive exploration,\u201d he added. \n \n \n \n In 2011, Rob Richardson, a researcher at the University of Leeds, sent a small snake-like robot into one of the tunnels of the Great Pyramid and took pictures of hieroglyphs that had not been seen for 4,500 years. \u201cI think people assume that all these mysteries of what\u2019s in our world are known but there are still places like the pyramids where we simply don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cThe pyramids have been there for thousands of years and we still don\u2019t know exactly why they are there, what they were used for, or how they were built.\u201d ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mark Lehner: \"A space that the builders left to protect the grand gallery?\" \n \n The mysteries of the pyramids have deepened with the discovery of what appears to be a giant void within the Khufu, or Cheops, monument in Egypt. \n \n It is not known why the cavity exists or indeed if it holds anything of value because it is not obviously accessible. \n \n Japanese and French scientists made the announcement after two years of study at the famous pyramid complex. \n \n They have been using a technique called muography, which can sense density changes inside large rock structures. \n \n The Great Pyramid, or Khufu's Pyramid, is thought to have been constructed during the reign of Pharaoh Khufu between 2509 and 2483 BC. \n \n At 140m (460 feet) in height, it is the largest of the Egyptian pyramids located at Giza on the outskirts of Cairo. \n \n ScanPyramids has already detected a smaller void on the northern face \n \n The new cavity is perhaps 30m long and several metres in height \n \n All three muon technologies sense the same feature in the same place \n \n Khufu famously contains three large interior chambers and a series of passageways, the most striking of which is the 47m-long, 8m-high Grand Gallery. \n \n The newly identified feature is said to sit directly above this and have similar dimensions. \n \n \"We don't know whether this big void is horizontal or inclined; we don't know if this void is made by one structure or several successive structures,\" explained Mehdi Tayoubi from the HIP Institute, Paris. \n \n \"What we are sure about is that this big void is there; that it is impressive; and that it was not expected as far as I know by any sort of theory.\" \n \n Image copyright SCANPYRAMIDS Image caption The newly found void is directly above the Grand Gallery \n \n The ScanPyramids team is being very careful not to describe the cavity as a \"chamber\". \n \n Khufu contains compartments that experts believe may have been incorporated by the builders to avoid collapse by relieving some of the stress of the overlying weight of stone. \n \n The higher King's Chamber, for example, has five such spaces above it. \n \n The renowned American archaeologist Mark Lehner sits on a panel reviewing ScanPyramids' work. \n \n He says the muon science is sound but he is not yet convinced the discovery has significance. \n \n \"It could be a kind of space that the builders left to protect the very narrow roof of the Grand Gallery from the weight of the pyramid,\" he told the BBC's Science In Action programme. \n \n \"Right now it's just a big difference; it's an anomaly. But we need more of a focus on it especially in a day and age when we can no longer go blasting our way through the pyramid with gunpowder as [British] Egyptologist Howard Vyse did in the early 1800s.\" \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mehdi Tayoubi: \"It's a big void, similar to the Grand Gallery, but what is it?\" \n \n One of the team leaders, Hany Helal from Cairo University, believes the void is too big to have a pressure-relieving purpose, but concedes the experts will debate this. \n \n \"What we are doing is trying to understand the internal structure of the pyramids and how this pyramid has been built,\" he told reporters. \n \n \"Famous Egyptologists, archaeologists and architects - they have some hypotheses. And what we are doing is giving them data. It is they who have to tell us whether this is expected or not.\" \n \n Much of the uncertainty comes down to the rather imprecise data gained from muography. \n \n This non-invasive technique has been developed over the past 50 years to probe the interiors of phenomena as diverse as volcanoes and glaciers. It has even been used to investigate the failed nuclear reactors at Fukushima. \n \n Muography makes use of the shower of high-energy particles that rain down on the Earth's surface from space. \n \n When super-fast cosmic rays collide with air molecules, they produce a range of \"daughter\" particles, including muons. \n \n These also move close to the speed of light and only weakly interact with matter. So when they reach the surface, they penetrate deeply into rock. \n \n But some of the particles will be absorbed and deflected by the atoms in the rock's minerals, and if the muon detectors are placed under a region of interest then a picture of density anomalies can be obtained. \n \n Image copyright SCANPYRAMIDS Image caption The muon detectors have to be placed under the region of interest \n \n The ScanPyramids team used three different muography technologies and all three agreed on the position and scale of the void. \n \n S\u00e9bastien Procureur, from CEA-IRFU, University of Paris-Saclay, emphasised that muography only sees large features, and that the team's scans were not just picking up a general porosity inside the pyramid. \n \n \"With muons you measure an integrated density,\" he explained. \"So, if there are holes everywhere then the integrated density will be the same, more or less, in all directions, because everything will be averaged. But if you see some excess of muons, it means that you have a bigger void. \n \n \"You don't get that in a Swiss cheese.\" \n \n The question now arises as to how the void should be investigated further. \n \n Jean-Baptiste Mouret, from the French national institute for computer science and applied mathematics (Inria), said the team had an idea how to do it, but that the Egyptian authorities would first have to approve it. \n \n \"Our concept is to drill a very small hole to potentially explore monuments like this. We aim to have a robot that could fit in a 3cm hole. Basically, we're working on flying robots,\" he said. \n \n The muography investigation at Khufu's Pyramid is reported in this week's edition of Nature magazine. \n \n Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter: @BBCAmos ||||| Scientists Say They've Found Hidden Space In Great Pyramid Of Giza \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption ScanPyramids mission ScanPyramids mission \n \n The Great Pyramid of Giza has been probed with the tools of modern particle physics by scientists who say they have discovered a huge, secret space hidden within its ancient walls. \n \n It is located above a tall, cathedral-like room known as the Grand Gallery, and this newly found space is comparable in size \u2014 about 100 feet long, according to a report in the journal Nature. \n \n That makes it a major structure within this royal tomb, which was built around 2500 B.C. and is considered to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Yet until now, despite centuries of study, no one knew this space was there. \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Amr Nabil/AP Amr Nabil/AP \n \n \"The romantic interpretation and what everyone wants to hear is that this is a hidden room and the king's body is inside or there's grave goods we didn't know about or we're going to learn more about history ... and none of that is responsible speculation at the moment,\" cautions Peter Der Manuelian, an Egyptologist at Harvard University who was not part of the research team. \n \n \"All we know is that we have a void, we have a cavity, and it's huge, which means possibly intentional and certainly worthy of further exploration,\" Manuelian says, noting that it's not yet clear whether it's a single chamber or more than one. \n \n \"In that sense it's obviously frustrating,\" he says. \"On the other hand, as an architectural discovery, something we didn't know about the interior of the Great Pyramid, it's absolutely big news.\" \n \n Indeed, the team that made the find reports that it is the first significant internal structure found within the Great Pyramid since the 19th century. \n \n Mehdi Tayoubi, with the HIP Institute in Paris, explains that he and his colleagues wanted to investigate the pyramid using the best available non-destructive analytical techniques. They settled on a type of imaging that involves muons, which are tiny particles, like electrons. \n \n \"What is strange, for me, is to use those very, very small particles for a huge monument like the pyramid,\" says Tayoubi. \n \n Muons are made when cosmic rays from deep space hit the atoms of the upper atmosphere. These particles rain down and lose energy as they pass through materials \u2014 like the thick stones of the pyramid \u2014 and that makes them slow down and decay. By placing muon detectors in strategic locations, researchers can count the number of muons coming through and create a kind of picture that reveals whether the material above is dense, like stone, or an empty space. \n \n Tayoubi explains that his team installed sheets of muon-detecting film in a lower-level room of the pyramid known as the Queen's Chamber. The goal was to test whether they could use muons to accurately discern two well-known rooms located above: the King's Chamber and Grand Gallery. \n \n They saw those rooms but, to their surprise, they found an additional large space as well. \n \n \"The first reaction was a lot of excitement, but then we knew that it would take us a long, long time, that we needed to be very patient in this scientific process,\" says Tayoubi. \n \n Because they didn't want to rely on just one method, they confirmed the find using two other muon-detection techniques. \n \n \"The good news is the void is there. Now we are sure that there is a void. We know that this void is big,\" says Tayoubi. \"I don't know what it could be. I think it's now time for Egyptologists and specialists in ancient Egypt architecture to collaborate with us, to provide us with some hypotheses.\" \n \n He's interested in whether small robots might somehow enter this space through tiny cracks or holes and provide more information. \n \n In the past, before the modern science of archaeology evolved, folks sometimes blasted through walls in the pyramids, says Manuelian. \n \n \"That's the good thing about the muon project, there's absolutely no damage to the pyramid at all,\" says Manuelian. \"I hope that, in collaboration with the Egyptian antiquities authorities, further exploration will be set in motion. The study of the pyramids has been going on for an awful long time. So any new contribution is always a welcome addition to our knowledge.\"",

It's the first discovery of a new structure in the monument since the 19th century, and it came by using muography, which can pick up on changes in density within rock.

The vote seems quite likely to be five to four. The more liberal members pressed both the narrow argument that an Alabama county was not a proper plaintiff because it inevitably would be covered and the broader argument that there was a sufficient record to justify the current formula. But the more conservative majority was plainly not persuaded by either point. It is unlikely that the Court will write an opinion forbidding a preclearance regime. But it may be difficult politically for Congress to enact a new measure. More analysis soon. \n \n Recommended Citation: Tom Goldstein, From the Shelby County argument, SCOTUSblog (Feb. 27, 2013, 10:55 AM), http://www.scotusblog.com/2013/02/from-the-shelby-county-argument/ ||||| Voting Procedures: A lawyer for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund talks about arguing in favor of the Voting Rights Act at the Supreme Court. \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 A central provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 may be in peril, judging from tough questioning on Wednesday from the Supreme Court \u2019s more conservative members. \n \n If the court overturns the provision, nine states, mostly in the South, would become free to change voting procedures without first getting permission from federal officials. \n \n In a vivid argument in which the lawyers and justices drew varying lessons from the legacies of slavery, the Civil War and the civil rights movement, the court\u2019s conservative wing suggested that the modern South had outgrown its troubled past and that the legal burdens on the nine states were no longer justified. \n \n Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. asked skeptically whether \u201cthe citizens in the South are more racist than citizens in the North.\u201d Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whose vote is probably crucial, asked whether Alabama today is an \u201cindependent sovereign\u201d or whether it must live \u201cunder the trusteeship of the United States government.\u201d \n \n Justice Antonin Scalia said the law, once a civil rights landmark, now amounted to a \u201cperpetuation of racial entitlement.\u201d \n \n That remark created the sharpest exchange of the morning, with Justice Sonia Sotomayor on the other end. \u201cDo you think that the right to vote is a racial entitlement?\u201d she later asked a lawyer challenging the law, with an edge in her voice that left little doubt she was responding to Justice Scalia\u2019s statement. \u201cDo you think that racial discrimination in voting has ended, that there is none anywhere?\u201d \n \n The outcome of the case will most likely remain in doubt until the end of the court\u2019s current term, in June. Many legal observers predicted that the justices would overturn part of the voting law in 2009, when the court had the same conservative-leaning majority, only to be proven wrong. \n \n One important change, however, is that Chief Justice Roberts suggested in the 2009 ruling that Congress update its formula to determine which parts of the country should remain subject to the law. Congress has not done so. \n \n The question at the heart of Wednesday\u2019s argument was whether Congress, in reauthorizing the provision for 25 years in 2006, was entitled to use a formula based on historic practices and voting data from elections held decades ago. \n \n Should the court strike down the law\u2019s central provision, it would be easier for lawmakers in the nine states to enact the kind of laws Republicans in several states have recently advocated, including tighter identification standards. It would also give those states more flexibility to move polling places and redraw legislative districts. \n \n The four members of the court\u2019s liberal wing, citing data and history, argued that Congress remained entitled to make the judgment that the provision was still needed in the covered jurisdictions. The law passed the Senate unanimously and House overwhelmingly, by a vote of 390 to 33 in 2006. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s an old disease,\u201d Justice Stephen G. Breyer said of efforts to thwart minority voting. \u201cIt\u2019s gotten a lot better. A lot better. But it\u2019s still there.\u201d \n \n Justice Kennedy said that history taught a different lesson, referring to the reconstruction of Europe after World War II. \u201cThe Marshall Plan was very good, too,\u201d he said. \u201cBut times change.\u201d \n \n Justice Breyer looked to a different conflict. \n \n \u201cWhat do you think the Civil War was about?\u201d he asked. \u201cOf course it was aimed at treating some states differently than others.\u201d He also said that the nation lived through 200 years of slavery and 80 years of racial segregation. \n \n Debo P. Adegbile, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which joined the government in defending the law, echoed that point. \u201cThis statute is in part about our march through history to keep promises that our Constitution says for too long were unmet,\u201d he said. \n \n The law was challenged by Shelby County, Ala., which said that its federal preclearance requirement, in Section 5 of the law, had outlived its usefulness and that it imposed an unwarranted badge of shame on the affected jurisdictions. \n \n The county\u2019s lawyer, Bert W. Rein, said that \u201cthe problem to which the Voting Rights Act was addressed is solved.\u201d",

In fact, writes Tom Goldstein at SCOTUSblog, expect a 5-4 decision in favor of striking down Section 5 of the act, one of its core provisions. It requires nine mostly Southern states to get federal permission when they want to change voting rules, and Antonin Scalia and others suggested the measure is no longer necessary, reports the New York Times. Scalia called it a \"perpetuation of racial entitlement,\" Anthony Kennedy wanted to know how long Alabama had to live \"under the trusteeship of the United States government,\" and Chief Justice John Roberts wondered whether people in the South were more racist than those in the North. The court's liberal wing made the case that the act is still necessary, with Stephen Breyer saying the \"old disease\" of racism, along with the desire to keep minorities from voting, remains. If the court strikes down the act, it would likely require Congress to come up with a new formula for it, but both the Times and SCOTUSblog think it's unlikely that would be politically possible.",

The train is believed to have had onboard CCTV, and there are a large number of cameras covering the network. \n \n Islamic State claimed responsibility for the blast, the militant group\u2019s Amaq news agency said on Friday evening. \n \n Nobody suffered life-threatening injuries in the incident, the fifth terrorist attack Britain has suffered in less than six months. Parsons Green station has since reopened. \n \n In a televised statement on Friday night, the prime minister said the UK terror threat level was being raised to its highest rating and that armed police and members of the military would be seen on the streets in the coming days. \n \n \n \n Play Video 0:55 Theresa May: terror threat level raised to critical after London tube blast \u2013 video \n \n \u201cFor this period, military personnel will replace police officers on guard duties at certain protected sites that are not accessible to the public,\u201d she said. \n \n \n \n \u201cThe public will see more armed police on the transport network and on our streets, providing extra protection. This is a proportionate and sensible step which will provide extra reassurance and protection while the investigation progresses.\u201d \n \n The prime minister condemned Friday\u2019s bombing as cowardly and the home secretary, Amber Rudd, denounced it as \u201ccallous and indiscriminate\u201d. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, described the attack as hideous and added: \u201cWe will never be defeated.\u201d \n \n The security minister Ben Wallace told the BBC on Saturday: \u201cWe haven\u2019t been able at the moment to catch the bomber.

He said support from the military would free up about 1,000 extra armed police officers, largely from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and Ministry of Defence police. \n \n \n \n A former army bomb disposal officer said it appeared the initiating charge of the device had exploded but had failed to detonate the main charge. \n \n \n \n Initially, police considered the possibility that the bomber had been among those taken to hospital, where many were treated for flash burns. \n \n Investigators. however, believe the device was remotely detonated, which suggested it may not have been intended as a suicide attack, and that the bomber may have left the train before the explosion. \n \n Donald Trump\u2019s first response to the attack \u2013 a tweet in which he claimed the \u201closer terrorist\u201d had been on Scotland Yard\u2019s radar, and that more proactive policing was required \u2013 was dismissed by a police spokesman as \u201cunhelpful\u201d.

This could be because the bomb-maker had got the recipe wrong. \n \n In the case of the 21/7 attacks, the attackers tried to create TATP, an explosive compound made from hydrogen peroxide, commonly sold as hair bleach, and other chemicals. \n \n They added chapatti flour to make the explosion more powerful still. But their chemistry was incompetent - in fact so incompetent that the ringleader had no idea, when he strapped on his rucksack, whether his device was capable of detonating or not. \n \n TATP was used in the Manchester Arena attack earlier this year - and it was also the chemical of choice for some of the Paris 2015 attackers and the men behind the Brussels Airport bombing the following year. \n \n Read more \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption There have been a \"number of people\" injured, police said \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Witnesses describe the explosion at Parsons Green \n \n Emma Stevie, 27, who was on the train when the explosion happened, said she was caught in a \"human stampede\" and crush on the station steps as people rushed away from the train. \n \n \"I wedged myself in next to a railing, I put myself in the foetal position,\" she said. \n \n \"There was a pregnant woman underneath me, and I was trying really hard not to crush her. \n \n \"I saw a poor little boy with a smashed-in head and other injuries.

    "document": "ALGIERS French warplanes and U.N. helicopters scoured the north of Mali on Thursday for the wreckage of an Air Algerie flight after it crashed carrying 110 passengers, nearly half of them French, from Burkina Faso to Algiers. \n \n French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said authorities believed flight AH5017 may have encountered bad weather after the pilot requested to change direction shortly after takeoff due to a storm. However, he said no hypothesis had been excluded. \n \n Officials in Mali and Burkina Faso gave conflicting accounts of locating the crash. \n \n Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita said wreckage of the flight had been spotted in his country's far north, toward the Algerian border between the towns of Aguelhoc and Kidal. \n \n However, General Gilbert Diendere, a member of the crisis unit in Burkina Faso, said his team had found remains in southern Mali, 50 km (30 miles) from the Burkinabe border. Local authorities in the nearby town of Gossi also told Reuters the wreckage had been located here. \n \n In Paris, Fabius said the flight, carrying 51 French nationals, had probably crashed but he said two French Mirage warplanes searching the vast desert area around the northern Malian city of Gao had spotted no wreckage. \n \n \"Despite intensive search efforts, no trace of the aircraft has yet been found,\" Fabius told journalists. \n \n An Algerian official, who asked not to be identified, confirmed the flight had crashed but provided no other details. \n \n French President Francois Hollande cancelled a planned visit to overseas territories and said France -- which has some 1,700 troops stationed in Mali -- would use all military means on the ground to locate the aircraft. \n \n \"The search will take as long as needed,\" Hollande told reporters. \"Everything must be done to find this plane. We cannot identify the causes of what happened.\" \n \n The searchers mission is complicated by the vast scale and daunting terrain of Mali. The area where the flight is suspected to have crashed is a sparsely inhabited region of scrubland and desert dunes stretching to the foothills of the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains. \n \n Much of it lies in the hands of Tuareg separatist rebels, who rose up against the government in early 2012, triggering an Islamist revolt that briefly seized control of northern Mali. \n \n The Malian government has only a weak presence in the region and relies on French and U.N. peacekeepers for aircraft and logistical support. \n \n Another plane crash is likely to add to nerves over flying after a Malaysia Airlines plane was downed over Ukraine last week, a TransAsia Airways crashed off Taiwan during a thunderstorm on Wednesday and airlines temporarily cancelled flights into Tel Aviv due to the conflict in Gaza. \n \n FRENCH PASSENGERS Algeria's state news agency APS said authorities lost contact with flight AH5017 an hour after it took off from Burkina Faso, but other officials gave differing accounts of the times of contact. \n \n Swiftair, the private Spanish company that owns the plane, confirmed it had lost contact with the MD-83 operated by Air Algerie, which it said was carrying 110 passengers and six crew. \n \n A spokeswoman for SEPLA, Spain's pilots union, said the six crew were from Spain. She could not give any further details. \n \n It said it took off from Burkina Faso at 0117 GMT and was due to land at 0510 GMT but never reached its destination. \n \n An Algerian aviation official said the last contact Algerian authorities had with the missing Air Algerie aircraft was at 0155 GMT when it was flying over Gao, Mali. Burkina Faso officials said the flight asked the control center in Niamey, Niger, to change route at 0138 GMT because of a storm in the Sahara. \n \n Burkina Faso authorities said the passenger list comprised 27 Burkinabe, 51 French, eight Lebanese, six Algerians, two from Luxembourg, five Canadians, four Germans, one Cameroonian, one Belgian, one Egyptian, one Ukranian, one Swiss, one Nigerian and one Malian. \n \n The Lebanese Foreign Ministry said its embassy in Abidjan estimated the number of Lebanese citizens on the flight was at least 20. Some of these may have dual nationality. \n \n \"We don't know anything yet. We have just heard from the news that the plane went missing,\" said Amina Daher, whose sister-in-line Randa was traveling on the plane with her three children, returning to Beirut to celebrate the Muslim religious festival of Eid El-Fitr with her family. \n \n RELATIVELY CLEAN RECORD \n \n The MD-83 is part of the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 family of twin-engined jets that entered service in 1980. A total of 265 of the MD-83 model were delivered before McDonnell Douglas, by then part of Boeing, halted production in 1999. \n \n \"Boeing is aware of the report. We are awaiting additional information,\" a spokesman for the U.S. planemaker said. \n \n According to the Ascend Fleets database held by British-based Flightglobal, there are 187 MD-83s still in operation, of which 80 percent are being flown in the United States. \n \n The aircraft's two engines are made by Pratt & Whitney, a unit of United Technologies. \n \n Swiftair has a relatively clean safety record, with five accidents since 1977, two of which caused a total of eight deaths, according to the Washington-based Flight Safety Foundation. \n \n Air Algerie's last major accident was in 2003 when one of its planes crashed shortly after take-off from the southern city of Tamanrasset, killing 102 people. In February this year, 77 people died when an Algerian military transport plane crashed into a mountain in eastern Algeria. \n \n (Additional reporting by Patrick Markey, Daniel Flynn, David Lewis, Mathieu Bonkoungou, Emma Farge, Julien Toyer, Tracy Rucinski, Laila Bassam, Marine Pennetier, John Irish and Tim Hepher; Writing by Patrick Markey; Editing by Alison Williams and Sonya Hepinstall) ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

And it's inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear.\" \n \n Obama spoke in a quiet and sometimes halting voice, without notes, touching on both his own experience as a black man and what he sees in his daughters, Sasha and Malia, and their relationship to children of other races. \"There are very few African American men who haven't had the experience of being followed in a department store. That includes me,\" he said. \n \n But he also struck a hopeful note, saying, \"As difficult and challenging as this episode has been, things are getting better.\" \n \n The president said that his daughters and their friends are \"better than we are, they\u2019re better than we were, on these issues. And that\u2019s true at every community I\u2019ve visited across this country.\" \n \n \u201cWe should also have confidence that kids these days, I think, have more sense than we did back then, and certainly more than our parents did or our grandparents did,\" Obama said. \"And along this long journey, we\u2019re becoming a more perfect union, not a perfect union, but a more perfect union.\u201d \n \n Obama said he and his deputies were considering a few concrete policy options in the wake of the Zimmerman verdict, such as trying to train state and local law enforcement officials how to better deal with issues of racial bias, and exploring whether state laws such as \"Stand Your Ground\" might \"encourage the kinds of altercations and confrontations\" rather than defuse them. \n \n More broadly, he said he wanted to pursue a \"long-term project\" of \"thinking about, how do we bolster and reinforce African American boys? And this is something that Michelle and I talk a lot about. There are a lot of kids out there that need help, that are getting a lot of negative reinforcement.\" \n \n It is important, Obama said, for individual Americans to \"do some soul-searching\" about their own inherent racial biases, and ask, \"Am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can?\" \n \n \"That would, I think, be an important exercise in the wake of this tragedy,\" he said. \n \n More on this story: \n \n Full video of Obama's remarks \n \n Full transcript \n \n The Fix: President Obama's remarkably personal speech on race \n \n Robert Zimmerman: 'I'm glad he spoke out today' ||||| CLOSE President Obama made a statement about the George Zimmerman trial verdict saying that he could have been Trayvon Martin 35 years ago.

He also said African Americans need to address the problems of violence in their own communities. \n \n African-American males know they are more likely to be both \"victims and perpetrators of violence,\" Obama said, and \"somebody like Trayvon Martin was probably statistically more likely to be shot by a peer than he was by somebody else.\" \n \n The problem is that so many people paint with a \"broad brush\" and see all black young men as potential criminals, Obama said. \n \n A Florida jury acquitted Zimmerman on Saturday night of murder in the 2012 death of 17-year-old Trayvon. This was Obama's first on-camera comments on the case since the verdict was handed down Saturday night. He had had issued a written statement calling for calm on Sunday. \n \n Obama has generally avoiding discussing racial issues -- today was probably his most extensive comments on the issue as president, reminiscent of his speech on race relations during the 2008 campaign. \n \n FIRST TAKE: Obama leading from behind on race \n \n In an extraordinary 19-minute appearance, Obama spoke personally and at times emotionally about the frustrations African-Americans have with the justice system, and the continuing racial divides that shadow the nation. \n \n \"I think it's important to recognize that the African American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that doesn't go away,\" Obama said, and \"it's going to be important for all of us to do some soul-searching.\" \n \n Obama told reporters that, like other African Americans, he has been followed by security guards while shopping, and has seen motorists lock their doors or women hold tighter to their purses as he walked near them. While didn't want to \"exaggerate,\" Obama said \"those sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida.\" \n \n He cited racial disparities in the criminal justice system, and how blacks tend to be charged more often with drug offenses and sentenced to longer prison terms than whites. He also said it's fair to wonder what would have happened in Florida if the shooter had been a young African-American. \n \n Obama said he respects the different views of the verdict, but the trial was conducted professionally, and \"once the jury has spoken, that's how our system works.\" While demonstrations and peaceful protests are understandable, he said violence \"dishonors what happened to Trayvon Martin and his family.\" \n \n Said Obama: \"Now, the question for me at least, and I think for a lot of folks, is where do we take this?\" \n \n While the Justice Department investigates whether to charge Zimmerman with civil rights violations in the case, Obama said state and local levels should examine whether changes to laws can head off violent confrontations. He cited laws to ban racial profiling, and proposed new kind of training for law enforcement in order \"to reduce the kind of mistrust in the system that sometimes currently exists.\" \n \n The president also questioned the wisdom of Florida's \"stand your ground\" law, which, in the view of critics, all but encourages confrontation that could turn deadly. \n \n Obama also suggested people consider whether Trayvon also had the right to stand his ground, adding: \"Do we actually think that he would have been justified in shooting Mr. Zimmerman who had followed him in a car because he felt threatened?\" \n \n The nation should also think about ways to \"bolster and reinforce our African American boys,\" Obama said, saying there are too many kids out there who need help, but \"are getting a lot of negative reinforcement.\" \n \n Obama said all Americans should do \"soul-searching\" in the wake of the verdict and the reactions to it, but questioned whether a full-blown \"national conversation\" would do much good if too many politicians or pundits were involved. \n \n \"On the other hand, in families and churches and workplaces, there's the possibility that people are a little bit more honest, and at least you ask yourself your own questions about, am I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can?\" Obama said. \n \n Borrowing a quote from Abraham Lincoln, Obama said political leaders should do whatever they can to encourage ''the better angels of our nature.\" rather than \"using these episodes to heighten divisions.\" \n \n Obama also said that Americans should realize that, over the course of decades, American race relations have improved, citing his daughters and their friends as examples. While that doesn't means \"we're in a post-racial society,\" Obama said there is progress. \n \n \"I don't want us to lose sight that things are getting better,\" Obama said. \n \n Obama also paid tribute to Trayvon's parents, saying that \"I can only imagine what they're going through and it's remarkable how they've handled it.\" \n \n In a statement, Trayvon's parents Tracy Martin and Sybrina Fulton said Friday, \"we are deeply honored and moved that President Obama took the time to speak publicly and at length about our son, Trayvon. The President's comments give us great strength at this time.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/12PhEZT ||||| Several people who have had conversations with Mr. Obama\u2019s top aides said a president who has rarely spoken about America\u2019s racial tensions from the White House was particularly torn about appearing to force the hand of Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general, when it comes to any investigations in the case. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The White House\u2019s original plan \u2014 for Mr. Obama to address the verdict in brief interviews on Tuesday with four Spanish-language television networks \u2014 was foiled when none of them asked about it. \n \n Instead, he appeared in the White House briefing room with no advance warning and little of the orchestration that usually accompanies presidential speeches. Mr. Obama spoke for 18 minutes, offering his own reflections and implicitly criticizing gun laws and racial profiling methods \u2014 both of which, critics say, played a role in Mr. Martin\u2019s death. \n \n Mr. Obama continued to avoid criticizing either the conduct of the trial or the verdict, in which a jury found a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., George Zimmerman, not guilty of all charges in the killing of Mr. Martin in February 2012. \n \n But in the most expansive remarks he has made about race since becoming president, Mr. Obama offered three examples of the humiliations borne by young black men in America: being followed while shopping in a department store, hearing the click of car doors locking as they cross a street, or watching as women clutch their purses nervously when they step onto an elevator. The first two experiences, he said, had happened to him. \n \n \u201cThose sets of experiences inform how the African-American community interprets what happened one night in Florida,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s inescapable for people to bring those experiences to bear.\u201d \n \n For black leaders who had beseeched the president to speak out \u2014 inundating White House officials with phone calls \u2014 his remarks were greeted with a mixture of relief and satisfaction. \n \n The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Mr. Obama had no choice but to confront mounting concern among African-Americans about the Martin case and recent Supreme Court rulings on affirmative action and voting rights. \n \n \u201cAt some point, the volcano erupts,\u201d Mr. Jackson said. \n \n From the moment the verdict was announced on Saturday night, black activists had called on Mr. Obama to express the anger and frustration of their community. The pressure only increased after he issued a carefully worded statement urging respect for the jury\u2019s decision. \n \n Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist and host on MSNBC, who urged Mr. Obama\u2019s advisers to have him speak out. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The parents of Mr. Martin, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, said they were \u201cdeeply honored and moved\u201d by Mr. Obama\u2019s comments. \u201cPresident Obama sees himself in Trayvon and identifies with him,\u201d they said in a statement on Friday. \u201cThis is a beautiful tribute to our boy.\u201d \n \n For some black activists, however, Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks were too little, too late. Tavis Smiley, a radio host who has long been a critic of the president, said the president has chosen to \u201clead from behind\u201d on race issues. \n \n The president\u2019s advisers selected the White House briefing room as the location for Mr. Obama\u2019s remarks during the Thursday meeting, calculating that it would be less formal than a full-dress speech \u2014 but would shield him from the questions he would likely face in a longer interview about why he had waited days after the verdict to speak. \n \n The advisers said Mr. Obama was anxious to confront the issue of race in a way that he has not since he ran for president in 2008. In a landmark speech to defuse the political storm over his Chicago pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., Mr. Obama spoke about what he called \u201cthe complexities of race\u201d in America. \n \n As president, Mr. Obama has only periodically returned to the subject. And on the few occasions that he has, it has often been in reaction to an event \u2014 a black Harvard professor\u2019s arrest, or Mr. Martin\u2019s death. A month after Mr. Martin was killed, Mr. Obama said, \u201cIf I had a son, he\u2019d look like Trayvon.\u201d \n \n The president\u2019s remarks on Friday were different: more expansive, more personal and more reflective of the concerns of fellow blacks. His comments mirror public opinion among African-Americans, according to polls. \n \n A telephone poll conducted June 13 to July 5 by Gallup found that blacks were \u201csignificantly less likely now than they were 20 years ago to cite discrimination as the main reason blacks on average have worse jobs, income, and housing than whites.\u201d It found that 37 percent of blacks today blame discrimination. In 1993, 44 percent said the same. \n \n Mr. Obama has also shown more willingness to speak in personal terms. At Morehouse College in Atlanta in May, he told graduates, \u201cSometimes I wrote off my own failings as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n His remarks Friday were also reminiscent of the tone in his speeches during his trip to Africa earlier this month. After standing in the cell that Nelson Mandela occupied for 18 years, Mr. Obama told a South African audience, \u201cYou\u2019ve shown us how a prisoner can become a president.\u201d \n \n On Friday, Mr. Obama brought that message home, urging Americans to be honest with themselves about how far this country has come in confronting its own racial history. \n \n \u201cAm I wringing as much bias out of myself as I can?\u201d he asked. \u201cAm I judging people, as much as I can, based on not the color of their skin but the content of their character? That would, I think, be an appropriate exercise in the wake of this tragedy.\u201d",

Today, he took it further: \"Trayvon could have been me 35 years ago,\" he said during an unscheduled stop in the White House briefing room to talk about the case. Some highlights, as noted by USA Today, the New York Times, and the Washington Post: \u201cI think it\u2019s important to recognize that the African-American community is looking at this issue through a set of experiences and a history that\u2014that doesn\u2019t go away.

Thanks Liz. \n \n Al Tompkins of the Poynter Institute has a thoughtful article on the journalistic considerations behind the Journal News decision to publish their map. I find myself entirely in agreement with his views on this issue. \n \n The problem is not that the Gannett-owned Journal News was too aggressive. The problem is that the paper was not aggressive enough in its reporting to justify invading the privacy of people who legally own handguns in two counties it serves. \n \n GOING GLOBAL: El Pais, the largest-circulated daily in Spain, has linked this article.

Based on reader submissions and this site in particular I have created a list of names and information sought. I then mapped what I had (above). I will add what more I get from readers and my own poking around. If you see some public data that matches, send me a link to [email protected] and I will add it as quick as I can. Be advised that the Journal News has been in downsizing mode for the past several years. I have to wonder if all these names are current employees but we will treat them as such until we learn otherwise. The map was begun with 11 names. \n \n Help fill in the blanks below. \n \n ** = loaded into Google map \n \n UPDATE 12/27 11:30 AM: With the assistance of readers JK, SS, BW, AH and others, the following entries have been updated and added to the map.

I removed Nicole Futterman, Dan Donovan, Jamie O'Grady and Howard Megdal as I am informed they are not full-time employees. I removed Rebecca Baker because she no longer works at the paper. I am finding that the Journal News has a lot of people listed on its web site as working for them who do not seem to actually work for them. \n \n Today, based on popular demand, I made the following FOIL request to the County Clerk's in Westchester, Rockland, and Putnam counties. \n \n Dear Mr. Clerk, This is a public records request. I would like to obtain a copy of the FOIL request made by the Journal News on through which they obtained information on pistol permit, any follow up communications with them regarding that request as well as any documents they obtained under FOIL. If they filed any sort of litigation to obtain additional information (e.g. an Article 78, etc.) I would like to obtain that as well. If this is a matter of forwarding some emails I would consider that an acceptable fill of my request. Where possible I would like records in electronic format. If possible, I would like the electronic documents converted into standard Microsoft Office format (Word, Excel, etc.). I would like all communications including the delivery of documents to take place via email as much as is possible based on the nature of the available records.. I would like the Records Access Officer to certify that the records are genuine. If the documents only exist in paper form I am willing to pay. If the cost of converting the documents to a standard electronic format or making photos copies exceeds $20.00 I would like prior notification of the estimated cost to comply with this records request. Sincerely, Robert Cox \n \n Managing Editor \n \n Talk of the Sound \n \n UPDATE: 12/30 8:30 AM \n \n I was interviewed for this article below but none of my answers were included. The writer, Ms. O'Donnell failed to mention in her email to me or in the article itself that she was, up until recently, a long-time employee of the Journal News. \n \n Reuters: New York newspaper to list more gun permit holders after uproar by Noreen O'Donnell. \n \n While she did not include my explanation as to why I created the map, she did manage to find a journalism professor to call me \"childish and petulant\". \n \n Some critics retaliated by posting reporters' and editors' addresses and other personal information online. \n \n Howard Good, a journalism professor at the State University of New York at New Paltz, called the critics' response childish and petulant. \n \n \"It doesn't move the issue of gun control to the level of intelligent public discussion,\" he said. \"Instead, it transforms what should be a rational public debate on a contentious issue into ugly gutter fighting.\" \n \n Draw your own conclusions about Ms. O'Donnell and Professor Good or why she gives him four paragraphs to criticize my actions and I get none to explain my actions. \n \n Here is my Q&A with the reporter that got left on the cutting-room floor. \n \n Q. What was your general reaction to the article and the map. A. Given the nature of my hyper-local site, I monitor lohud.com 24/7 so I saw the story as it was published to the web. I could not believe what I was seeing -- what I perceived to be a transparent attempt to intimidate and ostracize law-abiding citizens by using the Newtown murders as a pre-text to advance an anti-gun agenda and draw traffic to the site. You worked there so you know about their cost-cutting, outsourcing and pay-wall approach and how desperate things have become at the paper. At best, this map reeked of a stunt to drive traffic at the expense of private citizens who had done nothing that warranted having their privacy violated. In fact, I will not be surprised if there is a class-action lawsuit on privacy grounds. I can only laugh when the publisher claims the map is \"journalism\". The map is more like voyeurism than journalism with the Journal News acting as a digital \"Peeping Tom\", peering into the bedrooms of thousands of people just because they can. } The result is a map that is a bizarre form of \"gun porn\". The thought occurred to me to make a contra-Google Map the instant I saw the article. I was hesitant to do so because I am a First Amendment advocate and generally want to be supportive of newspapers and those who work there. I know plenty of people who work at Gannett, the Freedom Forum and the Newseum. I have spoken on panels at many of their events with people like Gene Policinski, Ken Paulson, John Seigenthaler and many others. I had the honor of being part of one of the inaugural exhibits at the Newseum for being the first blogger formerly credentialed as a blogger to cover a federal trial (Scooter Libby). I knew that creating such a contra-map was a serious, highly provocative move and would likely cause a number of the people referenced above to be very unhappy with me/ I mulled this over for two days. In the meantime my readers had taken it upon themselves to collect information about reporters and editors. They were also linking to Chris Fountain up in Greenwich, CT who is the one who really got the ball rolling. After being on the fence for a couple of days I decided to organize the efforts of my readers, create a crowd-sourcing project and start to build the contra-map. Q. Why did you decide to make the reporters' and editors' information public on the web. I trust you are aware that unlike most states, New York (and California) requires that a pistol permit holder to register EVERY handgun they own not just get the license. The initial Journal News FOIL request sought this information. I expect that the Journal News will ultimately prevail and get this information and update their map and make it searchable by weapon type. I would oppose that as I do the current iteration of the map. I did not want to merely respond but discourage further development of their map or at least give them pause. I wanted a direct and proportionate response in the spirit of \"do unto others as you would have them do unto you\". I could not think of anything more direct and proportionate than flipping the script by using public records to map the folks at the Journal News the way they mapped my friends and neighbors. I hope they now realize that in the age of social media and blogs, the people known formerly as the audience, can throw a counterpunch from time to time. My map was my counterpunch. \n \n UPDATE: 12/30 8:45 AM \n \n Per my FOIL request (above) to the Putnam County Clerk, I obtain a copy of the email sent by the Journal News reporter who wrote the map story. From this it is clear the Journal News sought (and continues to seek) not to create just a map of \"pistol permit holders\" but a map of every gun registered in Westchester, Rockland and Putnam counties. The have requested information on every type of weapon including \"manufacturer, type of weapon, caliber, serial number and model\". \n \n Putnam-JN Pistol FOIL.pdf \n \n FOIL REQUEST Worley, Dwight [[email protected]] \n \n Mr. Bartolotti, \n \n Sent: Monday, December 17, 2012 2:26 PM \n \n To: Michael Bartolotti Under the provisions of the New York Freedom of Information Law, Article 6 of the Public Officers Law, I hereby request records or portions thereof pertaining to Putnam County\u2019s pistol permit database. I am requesting the names, complete addresses, the type of permits issued (carry concealed/possess on \n \n premises/possess carry during employment), and the type of weapons possessed, including the weapon's \n \n manufacturer, type of weapon, caliber, serial number and model, for all permit holders in your database. Also, please provide a complete record layout and data dictionary for your pistol permits database. I would like all of the records in electronic format, such as a database, spreadsheet, plain text file or other digital format. I have been instructed instructed by you that state penal law prohibits the disclosure of the types of weapons possessed by permit holders even though such information is collected by the county. If it is determined that that category of information cannot be released please process my request, excluding the protected information, without delay. In your response, please indicate the specific sections of the law that expressly prohibit the disclosure of the protected information. As you know, all government records and data are presumed public unless there is a specific provision of law barring their release. So while the law expressly says names and addresses of permit holders are to be made public, if the law does not specifically bar the release of the types of permits issued and types of weapons possessed, that information can and should be released. In that case, I would expect that information to be included. As Robert Freeman, executive director of the New York State Committee on Open Government, has said in \n \n several opinions regarding the disclosure of pistol permit data beyond names and addresses, \u201cthe only instance in which records must be withheld would involve the case in which a statute prohibits disclosure. Again, as I interpret \u00a7400.00 of the Penal Law, there is nothing in that statute that precludes the custodian of the records at issue from disclosing the records.\u201d If there are any fees for copying the records requested, please inform me before filling the request or please supply the records without informing me if the fees are not in excess of $25. This request is in relation to a news event. Because of the timely nature of this request, I ask that it be expedited. Also, because of time constraints, I ask that if there are any concerns or questions regarding this request that I be contacted by telephone at 914\u2010629\u20101060 or by email at [email protected]. As you know, the Freedom of Information Law requires that an agency respond to a request within five business days of receipt of a request. Therefore, I would appreciate a response as soon as possible and look forward to hearing from you shortly. If for any reason any portion of my request is denied, please inform me of the reasons for the denial in writing and provide the name and address of the person or body to whom an appeal should be directed. Thank you for your prompt attention. Dwight R.

Worley \n \n Journal News Media Group \n \n 1133 Westchester Avenue Suite N110 \n \n White Plains, NY 10604 RE: FOIL request Dear Mr. Worley: This office is in receipt of your electronic mail message dated December 17th, 2012 in which you request certain information in electronic format for all pistol permit files maintained by this office. This request is quite involved and will yield voluminous results. Further, certain information requested may be withheld due to operation of law. This office is currently working with its IT provider to compile the requested information. Upon a complete compilation of the information suitable for dissemination we will provide you with an estimate of cost as well as instructions on how to complete your request. I hope that you can work with this office by illustrating patience and if you have any questions please contact this office. Thank you very much. Sincerely Michael C. Bartolotti \n \n For those not familiar with the Freedom of Information Law in New York State, as a general summary, an agency has 5 business days to acknowledge receipt of a request for information and 22 business days after that to deny, fulfill or partially deny/partially fulfill a records request. After the 22 days the agency must provide the records or explain why they need more time and then provide a date certain when the records will be available. As a practical matter, a public records officer can keep a request pending for 27 business days and the requestor has no grounds to appeal or challenge the agency. Agencies can also charge for records based on a scale described in the statute. \n \n In this case, the Clerk got the request on Monday December 17th. The Clerk then waited until the last day of the week, Friday December 21st before acknowledging receipt and has still not provided the records. Adding in three holidays -- Christmas, New Year's Day and Martin Luther King Day -- the clerk does not have to deliver the records until January 25th, 2013. \n \n The Clerk's in Rockland County and Westchester County had the same option and chose to expedite the request. Readers can draw their own conclusions as to why 2 clerks turned over the requested records a month earlier than required and 1 clerk has still not turned over the requested records. \n \n I hope to have a copy of communications between the Journal News and the other two clerks soon. \n \n UPDATE: 12/30 9:22 AM \n \n This is interesting, from the Christian Science Monitor \n \n In an online survey, the Journal News finds overwhelming support \u2013 89-11 percent \u2013 for the proposal to keep gun ownership private. \n \n UPDATE: 12/30 9:24 AM \n \n We made Wikipedia. \n \n http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Journal_News#Controversy \n \n UPDATE: 12/30 9:30 AM \n \n The Westchester County Firearm Owners Association is an organization whose members were most directly targeted by the Journal News. They view the map as an attempt by the paper to \"intimidate and bully lawful gun-owning citizens\". \n \n In response, the WCFOA has compiled a list of Journal News Advertisers. \n \n gannett_advertisers_12-28-2012_c.pdf \n \n There has been a great deal of interest from readers in such a list so, with permission, we reprint that list below. The list is based on online resources and volunteers reviewing the print editions of the paper to identify advertisers. According to the WCFOA, the focus was on consumer-oriented advertiser so not every advertised was included in this list. \n \n The WCFOA is encouraging its members and supporters to write a short letter which starts by \"quickly outlining the irresponsible Journal News act of publishing the names and addresses of pistol license holders (and a Google Map with directions and family members names)\". The want the letters to state \"you will no longer patronize any advertiser who uses Gannett unless and until that advertiser withholds further ads until Gannett takes down the pistol license page and ceases attacking lawful firearm ownership.\" \n \n MAJOR AND NATIONAL ADVERTISERS \n \n AARON'S \n \n aarons.com \n \n 1-877-607-9999 \n \n 1-800-950-7368 \n \n Garet Hayes \n \n Senior Vice President \n \n Hope-Beckham, Inc. \n \n Office: 404.604.2602 \n \n Mobile: 770.403.8720 \n \n [email protected] \n \n Ace Hardware \n \n acehardware.com \n \n 2200 Kensington Court \n \n Oak Brook, IL 60523 \n \n U.S.A \n \n 1-866-290-5334 \n \n 1.630.990.6600 \n \n ALDI Grocery \n \n aldi.us \n \n Aldi Inc. \n \n 1200 N Kirk Rd, Batavia, IL 60510-1443, United States \n \n Phone: (630) 879-8100 \n \n Corporate Phone Number: 1-630-879-8100 \n \n Babies 'R Us \n \n babiesrus.com \n \n Babies R Us Corporate Office Headquarters \n \n Toys R Us, Inc. \n \n 1 Geoffrey Way \n \n Wayne, NJ 07470-2030 USA \n \n Corporate Phone Number: 1-973-617-3500 \n \n Fax: 973-617-4006 \n \n Customer Service Number: 1-888-222-9787 \n \n Best Buy \n \n bestbuy.com \n \n Best Buy Corporate Office Headquarters in the USA: \n \n 7601 Penn Avenue South \n \n Richfield, MN 55423 \n \n Corporate Phone Number: 1-612-291-1000 \n \n Corporate Fax Number: 1-612-292-4001 \n \n Corporate Email: [email protected] \n \n the email [email protected] does not work.

We have 8 names left. \n \n SMALL FAVOR TO MY TEAM: While I have this crack team of researches hard at work I will take everything you can find on these two individuals James Vincent Bonanno and his son, Vince James Bonanno. You can certainly appreciate that given my willingness to take on causes like this Journal News map I have made more than my share of The Bonannos are currently suing me for defamation in New York State Supreme Court because I accurately reported on their various misdeeds. They both work for the local school district. \n \n This is the father\u2026 \n \n James Vincent Bonanno \n \n 24 Ronalds Avenue \n \n New Rochelle, NY \n \n Not sure where the son lives\u2026 \n \n Vince James Bonanno (\"Little Jimmy\") \n \n Any information you can pull on them will be appreciated. Little Jimmy, a heroin addict who is in the Westchester County Methadone Program has at least one prior arrest that I know of, not sure about the father. I believe the father is also involved in various side-businesses. \n \n JOURNAL NEWS REPORTERS/EDITORS/STAFF \n \n **The Journal News/LoHud.com** \n \n Main Office: \n \n The Journal News \n \n 1133 Westchester Avenue \n \n Suite N110 \n \n White Plains, NY 10604 \n \n Main phone number: 914-694-9300 \n \n Report breaking news: 914-694-5077 \n \n **The Journal News/LoHud.com** \n \n Mount Kisco Bureau \n \n The Journal News \n \n 1133 Westchester Avenue \n \n 185 Kisco Avenue \n \n Mount Kisco, NY 10549 \n \n Main phone number: 914-666-6579 \n \n The Mt.

In that time, he has covered 9/11, elections in Israel, national political conventions, several World Series, and all facets of local news. Covering national and international events is exciting, however Harrison gains tremendous satisfaction telling the stories close to home. \"The mother who has dedicated her life to helping to find a cure for the rare and fatal disease that afflicts her son, the story of troubled children housed in residential treatment centers, or the scores of young Mormon's who come to this area every year to try to spread their faith, are the types of stories that allow me to step in to the lives of our neighbors and offer a glimpse of lives that, while unfolding right around the corner, are very different from our own.\" Harrison has a bachelor's degree in photojournalism from Rochester Institute of Technology. A lower Westchester resident, he was born in Brooklyn, and grew up in Yonkers and Hastings-on-Hudson. He is married with three daughters. \n \n **Janet Hasson** \n \n Publisher \n \n The Journal News/LoHud.com \n \n 3 Gate House Lane \n \n Mamaroneck, NY 10543 \n \n Home Phone: (914) 694-5204 \n \n Work Phone: \n \n Work Email: \n \n Twitter: \n \n FB: \n \n LinkedIN: http://www.linkedin.com/pub/janet-hasson/6/316/254 \n \n Zillow: http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/17-Mcbride-Ave-White-Plains-NY-10603/3... \n \n Image File: http://www.westchestermagazine.com/images/2011/BLOGS/June/914INC/Blog_Ja... \n \n **Tim Henderson** \n \n Data Analyst \n \n The Journal News/LoHud.com \n \n 111 W Washington Avenue \n \n Pearl River, NY 10965-2112 \n \n Home Phone: \n \n Work Phone: \n \n Work Email: [email protected] \n \n Twitter: https://twitter.com/timhendo \n \n FB: https://www.facebook.com/henderson.tim \n \n LinkedIN: http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tim-henderson/4/264/429 \n \n Image File: https://si0.twimg.com/profile_images/2797748958/0aa24ccd8e093b25a31ee47b... \n \n Lee Higgins \n \n Breaking News Reporter \n \n The Journal News/LoHud.com \n \n Home Address: \n \n Home Phone: \n \n Work Phone: 914-696-8570 \n \n Work Email: [email protected] \n \n Twitter: https://twitter.com/LeeHiggins \n \n FB: \n \n LinkedIN: \n \n Image File: \n \n Brian Howard \n \n Social Media Editor \n \n The Journal News/LoHud.com \n \n Home Address: \n \n Home Phone: \n \n Work Phone: 914-666-6177 \n \n Work Email: [email protected] \n \n Twitter: https://twitter.com/TheBrianHoward \n \n FB: https://www.facebook.com/howard.brian#!/HowardBrianJ \n \n LinkedIN: linkd.in/UbA6UX \n \n Image File: \n \n **Laura Incalcaterra** \n \n Reporter for Rockland Government/Politics, Environment, Development and Housing \n \n The Journal News/LoHud.com \n \n 78 Regina Road \n \n Airmont, NY 10952 \n \n 845-356-9215 \n \n Work Phone: 845-578-2486 \n \n Work Email: [email protected] \n \n Twitter: https://twitter.com/LauraLoHud (REMOVED) \n \n FB: \n \n LinkedIN: \n \n Image File: http://www.lohudblogs.com/mugs/lincalcaterra.jpg \n \n Laura Incalcaterra covers the environment, open space and zoning and planning issues for The Journal News.

He is in the Westchester County list provided to the Journal News and he is a dot in the map so we can at least put to rest any conspiracy theories in this regard. \n \n [removed] \n \n Journal News Hypocrisy \n \n Most of the readers of this article are not from the area and may have never heard of the Journal News until this week. Many of speculated on the motives behind their pistol LICENSE map. If you want just a few of very real examples of hypocrisy from the Journal News you can look at the following three exclusive stories than we have run over the past three months that the Journal News did not bother to report at all. \n \n New Rochelle Police Confiscate Loaded .9mm Semi-Automatic Carbine from Monroe College Basketball Player, Former Coach of the Year Fired \n \n By any measure, this is a major story -- a member of the NJCAA National Championship women's basketball team delivers a savage beating to a teammate. While the victim of the assault is in the hospital she receives a text message from her assailant threatening to kill her, and her mother with a gun she keeps at an apartment on campus. School officials recovered a loaded .9mm Semi-Automatic Carbine. Before the District Attorney could bring charges the player fled the state. The player was kicked off the team, the other player suspended and the coach fired because he knew of the gun and failed to report it to school officials or the police. \n \n The Journal News did not cover this story at all. Monroe College is a major advertiser in Westchester County. \n \n New Rochelle Suspends Three Following Gun to Head Incident on Bee-Line School Bus \n \n Three students leave a school bus an enter a middle school with a gun after terrorizing a 6th grader on the bus by placing her in a headlock, holding the gun to her head and threatening her. The Journal News does not report on this incident. \n \n New Rochelle Barnard School Principal Waits Hours to Notify Police of Intruder; Parents Told Man In Building Was Outside \n \n In this case, a man was in the building for hours, he was found hiding in a closet in a second floor classroom by a teaching assistant. Even then, the building principal waited 45 minutes to call police and then lied about the entire incident to parents. The Journal News did not cover this story. \n \n New Rochelle Board President Says District in \"Full Compliance\" with School Safety Laws \n \n Four days after the Newtown Shooting, the local school board President and Superintendent make false claims that the district is in full compliance with New York State school safety laws. By statute the district must review and update plans for the district and each school in the district once a year. 10 of 11 schools have not been updated since 2001. The 11th was updated in 2006. The Journal News does not even cover the board meeting let along report this. \n \n UPDATE: 1/2 9:15 AM: I appeared this morning on the Pat Campbell Show in Tulsa, OK to discuss the latest on the Journal News gun owner map: Pat Campbell Show 1-2-13 \n \n UPDATE: 1/2 12:10 PM: My FOIL request to the Westchester County Clerk resulted in my receiving the communications between the clerk's office and Journal News reporter Dwight Worley. It was a jumbled mess of documents which I cut, paste and re-ordered in chronological order so readers can follow the discussion between Deputy Clerk John J. Allen and Worley (link below). \n \n Communications Between Westchester County Clerk & Journal News for FOIL Pistol Licenses December 2012 \n \n I am requesting the names, complete addresses, the type of permits issued (carry concealed/possess on \n \n premises/possess carry during employment), and the type of weapons possessed, including the weapon's \n \n manufacturer, type of weapon, caliber, serial number and model, for all permit holders in your database. \n \n Also, please provide a complete record layout and data dictionary for your pistol permits database. \n \n There is a brief sidebar after Worley appeals the partial denial of the paper's request to County Executive Rob Astorino on December 17th and County Attorney Robert F. Meehan responds for Astorino on December 20th to deny the appeal. The Westchester County Clerk Tim Idoni is a Democrat from New Rochelle (where we operate) and Astorino is a Republican. If you are wondering how divided government works in Westchester read how the Democrats in the County Legislature literally turned out the lights in the chamber when they did not get their way on the 2013 budget. \n \n This stands in stark contrast to the decided lack of cooperation in Putnam County, north of Westchester. \n \n New York County denies request for names of gun permit holders \n \n Authorities in a suburban county north of New York City said on Tuesday they will refuse to release names of local gun permit holders to a newspaper that has been publishing the identities of thousands of license-holding residents. Putnam County Clerk Dennis Sant said he would defy a request for information about pistol permit holders from the White Plains, New York-based Journal News, which has come under criticism for publishing thousands of such identities already. \n \n UPDATE 1/2 2:50 PM: I have been advised that the phone listing for Robert Brum in Pomona is incorrect. Please disregard 845-354-0243. That is the number for an older woman who was assigned that number after Robert Brum moved. \n \n UPDATE 1/3 8:30 AM: Newspaper threatened with \u2018suspicious white powder\u2019 after publishing gun owners\u2019 names \n \n The suspicious package turned out to be a non-event but I was surprised to see this... \n \n The article mentions Christopher Fountain who put up a lot of detail about the publisher, Janet Hasson and a few other Journal News employees. I am not sure how many, maybe 5 or 6 names. New York State Rifle and Pistol Association President Tom King is quoted saying \u201cI\u2019m sure that the blogger will take down the list as soon as the gun names come down.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, we have now crowd-sourced 73 of 82 (89%) Journal News employees and mapped each one. We are in the process of clearing the list and I expect we will be at 100% shortly. \n \n I would tell Mr. King a thing or three: (1) the Journal News intends to EXPAND their map to include Putnam County not take it down; (2) the Journal News was never just seeking names and addresses -- their Freedom of Information Request is for \"names, complete addresses, the type of permits issued (carry concealed/possess on premises/possess carry during employment), and the type of weapons possessed, including the weapon's manufacturer, type of weapon, caliber, serial number and model, for all permit holders in your database; (3) (1) I have no intention of taking down my list or map regardless of what the Journal News does or what he says. \n \n UPDATE 1/3 1:15 PM: If my actions are going to be disapproved of by anyone I would prefer that it be Jack Shafer: Let\u2019s not go crazy over publishing gun lists \n \n Undeterred by the fact that the handgun data was, by state law, a matter of the public record, aggrieved gun owners retaliated. A crowdsourced map of the home addresses of Journal News employees \u2014 including their home and work phone numbers when found \u2014 went up. The site also listed the names and addresses of the paper\u2019s local and national advertisers, suggesting Journal News readers write letters threatening to boycott their goods and services unless the Journal News took its map down. The New York State & Pistol Association urged a boycott of all Gannett enterprises, asserting that the map had \u201cput in harm\u2019s way tens of thousands of lawful license holders.\u201d [read entire article] \n \n I met Jack in 2004 at a conference at Harvard. He wrote the PressBox column for Slate/Washington Post for years and I have emailed him from time to time. Between Jack Shafer and Jim Romensko you get about all you need in terms of media criticism. Jim was, for many years at Poynter. Jack writes today \"Exactly how publishing public-record data constitutes privacy invasion is a topic worthy of a Poynter Institute seminar.\" Ironically, I was part of a Poynter conference on Online Journalism Ethics. I am pretty sure my map would have flunked the ethics test in that room back in 2006. The question then might be if my map flunks then what about the Journal News map? Having been part of this discussion in the past, I can tell you that some of the opinion would be driven by the idea that journalists are like members of a holy order on a divine mission. Not everyone at Poynter would take the side of the Journal News but I suspect they would also be against my map. \n \n I can tell you one other thing -- the melodrama that has ensued with the armed guards and the envelopes of talcum powder is the sort of thing that validates the self-image of journalists that what they do is important (and thus justifies the low wages they are paid). \n \n UPDATE: 1/9 9:00 AM - I was away this weekend and so not entirely top of this story. I was in Miami for the BCS Championship Game to see my Irish get stomped by Alabama :-(. I am back in New York. \n \n On my way to the airport, I received an email from WPIX 11's Erica Pitzi requesting an interview. Many of the questions were to the effect of whether I felt I was to blame for people who were making death threats to Journal News employees or whether I would take my map down after a New York Times article reported on threats against Journal News employees. (My answer? \"No\"). Having viewed what aired, the piece struck me as fairer than I expected. \n \n WPIX ARTICLE/VIDEO: Death threats, reporters\u2019 families targeted over controversial gun-owner map \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think my map is particularly fair to the Journal News employees, many of them have nothing to do with the story, but that\u2019s in the same spirit of the Journal News map which is equally unfair,\u201d Cox told PIX 11 News over the phone from Florida. \n \n In The New York Times article, Journal News Publisher Janet Hasson seeks to shift the issue away from Newtown, away from their map of gun owners, away from the entire issue of gun control and convert the issue into a First Amendment issue. \n \n \"As journalists, we are prepared for criticism,\" Hasson told The Times. \"But in the U.S., journalists should not be threatened.\" \n \n Actually, in the U.S., no one should be threatened. In fact, there are laws against threatening people with bodily harm and the apply to everyone, not just journalists. As I told WPIX, an appropriate response is to boycott or picket or otherwise express disapproval. Physically threatening someone is never the right thing to do. \n \n EDITORS NOTE:Speaking of getting paid.

DAM \n \n Click to Donate \n \n UPDATE: The Journal News has removed their gun map. Before you ask. \"No, we are not taking down our map\". \n \n Here is the official statement from Janet Hasson: \n \n With the passage this week of the NYSAFE gun law, which allows permit holders to request their names and addresses be removed from the public record, we decided to remove the gun permit data from lohud.com at 5 pm today. While the new law does not require us to remove the data, we believe that doing so complies with its spirit. For the past four weeks, there has been vigorous debate over our publication of the permit data, which has been viewed nearly 1.2 million times by readers. One of our core missions as a newspaper is to empower our readers with as much information as possible on the critical issues they face, and guns have certainly become a top issue since the massacre in nearby Newtown, Conn. Sharing as much public information as possible provides our readers with the ability to contribute to the discussion, in any way they wish, on how to make their communities safer. We remain committed to our mission of providing the critical public service of championing free speech and open records. \n \n Self-serving claptrap from a woman who thought she could pick a fight at a time and place of her choosing, declare the rules for the fight and call the fight when she had enough. \n \n Sorry, Janet. It doesn't work that way. Our map of your employees stays. \n \n UPDATE: Just taped a radio interview with Gary Baumgarten of 1010 WINS-NY. Let me know if you hear it air. Teaser: he asked me if this was a victory, my answer \"yes!\" \n \n WINS 1010 has published a story with the audio clip here. \n \n UPDATE 1/21: My Washington Examiner Op-Ed is now up: Why I will not be taking down my map of Journal News employees \n \n UPDATE 1/23: I was on the Pat Campbell Show this morning, live on KFAQ 1170 Tulsa. \n \n Listen here. \n \n I also joined Pat, filling in, on the Schnitt Show this afternoon. \n \n Listen here. ||||| A week after the Newtown massacre, The Journal News published an interactive Google Map with the names and addresses of gun permit owners in select New York cities. The bold move has escalated into a transparency arms race, after a Connecticut lawyer posted the phone number and addresses of the Journal\u2018s staff, including a Google Maps satellite Image of the Publisher\u2019s home. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether the Journal\u2019s publisher Janet Hasson is a permit holder herself, but here\u2019s how to find her to ask,\u201d read Christopher Fountain\u2019s blog post. The double irony here is that open data was heralded as a tool of enlightened civic dialog, and has been co-opted for fierce partisanship, bordering on public endangerment. \n \n The Journal\u2018s original publication of the map sparked nationwide outrage and thousands of angry comments. Gun permit holding is public information in New York, and can be acquired through a mere request via the Freedom of Information Act. But, coming on the heels of the Newtown shooting, the publication had a clear provocative intent. \u201cNew York residents have the right to own guns with a permit and they also have a right to access public information,\u201d said a defiant Hasson. \n \n Given that the Bushmaster .223-caliber rifle used in the school shooting was reportedly legally registered with the killer\u2019s mother, the Google Map sparked a debate about whether gun owners should be labeled like other potential menaces to society, \u201cThe implications are mind-boggling,\u201d said Marine Scott F. Williams to The Journal News, \u201cIt\u2019s as if gun owners are sex offenders (and) to own a handgun risks exposure as if one is a sex offender. It\u2019s, in my mind, crazy.\u201d \n \n Blogger Christopher Fountain took the debate into his own hands, publishing the personal information of The Journals\u2018 staff. \u201cHundreds of thousands of readers; Janet, you have a great Christmas Eve,\u201d he wrote, after a popular political outlet, Instapundit, linked to his post. \n \n Ironically, the promise of open data was supposed to lead to open-minded discussion. \u201cIf the broad light of day could be let in upon men\u2019s actions, it would purify them as the sun disinfects,\u201d reads the often-cited quote from Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, who stands a champion to modern-day nonprofits fighting for greater access to health, legislative, and administrative government data. \n \n Open data advocates have struggled to get media attention for their utopian vision of automated government services. This latest use of open data via Google Maps, both to publish gun permit ownership and journalists\u2019 geolocation data, seems to have hit the media sweet spot, as it plays into our debased partisan interests. It appears that transparency lends itself equally to being both a tool of democracy or a partisan weapon.",

The paper is also suing the Times for $1.5 million, among other things. The newspaper's publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., has also filed a lawsuit against the Post, claiming that the newspaper violated a state law requiring it to publish the publisher's opinion articles. The lawsuit also accuses the Post of violating its contract with the Times by publishing them without permission. The Post says it's not clear whether the paper even knew about the lawsuit, but it says it will continue to investigate the matter.

    "document": "Health Foodborne toxin could trigger MS, studies suggest Jan. 28, 2014 at 3:16 PM ET \n \n CDC / CDC \n \n Add another clue to the mystery of multiple sclerosis: Scientists say a poison produced by common foodborne germs could be a trigger for the debilitating autoimmune disorder that affects 400,000 Americans. \n \n Researchers at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York have discovered that a toxin made by the bacterium Clostridium perfringens \u2014 responsible for a million cases of food poisoning in the U.S. each year \u2014 appears to attack the cells associated with MS. \n \n \u201cWhat we\u2019ve shown is the toxins target the cells that are targeted in MS,\u201d said Jennifer Linden, a Weill Cornell researcher who\u2019s presenting findings Tuesday at a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology. \n \n Her research also showed that about 13 percent of a small sample of food products harbored C. perfringens bacteria, and nearly 3 percent were positive for the toxin linked to MS. \n \n It\u2019s too early to suggest that MS is caused by food poisoning, but it does raise the possibility that the C. perfringens bacteria could be involved in activating the disease, said Bruce F. Bebo, associate vice president of discovery research for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. \n \n \u201cTo me, if you were going to design a trigger for this disease, this would really fit the mold really well,\u201d Bebo said. \n \n Specifically, it\u2019s the epsilon toxin, one of 12 protein toxins produced by C. perfringens bacteria. Not only does the toxin attack the brain\u2019s blood-brain barrier, it also kills the brain\u2019s myelin-producing cells, the same cells that die in MS lesions, Linden said. \n \n MS is a disease in which the fatty sheath around the nerves of the brain and spinal cord, called myelin, is destroyed, leading to a wide range of symptoms. \n \n MS is thought to be caused by an environmental trigger, something scientists have sought for years, Bebo said. But the new theory from Weill Cornell\u2019s team led by Dr. Timothy Vartanian, a professor of neurology and neuroscience, is particularly promising, Bebo said. \n \n Most cases of C. perfringens food poisoning in people are caused by the A strain of the bacteria, one of five types. The B and D types, which produce the epsilon toxin, have rarely been seen in people. But last year, Weill Cornell researchers reported that they\u2019d discovered the B strain in a 21-year-old MS patient, proving infection was possible. \n \n They also examined banked blood and spinal fluid samples from MS patients and healthy controls and found that the MS patients were 10 times more likely to show evidence of antibodies signaling they\u2019d previously been exposed to the epsilon toxin. \n \n If the link with MS is proven, it\u2019s possible that a vaccine or drug or probiotic treatment could be developed to destroy the C. perfringens B and D bacteria, which make the toxin, Vartanian has said. ||||| New research presented at a scientific meeting adds to a growing body of evidence that a toxin produced by a common food bug may trigger multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. \n \n Dr. Jennifer Linden, a microbiologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, presented the research at the 2014 ASM Biodefense and Emerging Diseases Research Meeting that is taking place in Washington, D.C., this week. \n \n Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory disease, where the body's own immune system attacks and destroys healthy tissue in the central nervous system. The disease gradually disrupts the blood brain barrier (BBB) and destroys myelin, the protein that insulates the nerves in the spinal cord, brain and optic nerve and stops the electrical signals they convey from leaking out. \n \n As the disease progresses, patients experience symptoms ranging from mild numbness in the arms and legs to paralysis and blindness. \n \n According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, MS affects around 400,000 Americans, and with the exception of trauma, it is thought to be the most frequent cause of neurological disability that starts before old age. \n \n Epsilon toxin may be a trigger for MS \n \n MS is thought to result when genetically susceptible individuals are exposed to one or more environmental triggers. But while we have not yet firmly identified the triggers, there is increasing evidence, like this latest research, that a toxin called epsilon produced by certain strains of food bacteria is one of them, as Dr. Linden explains: \n \n \"We provide evidence that supports epsilon toxin's ability to cause BBB permeability and show that epsilon toxin kills the brain's myelin producing cells, oligodendrocytes; the same cells that die in MS lesions.\" \n \n She and her colleagues also found that epsilon toxin targets other types of cells associated with MS inflammation, found in other parts of the central nervous system. \n \n \"Epsilon toxin may be responsible for triggering MS,\" concludes Dr. Linden. \n \n Epsilon toxin produced by certain strains of food bug C. perfringens \n \n Epsilon toxin is produced by certain strains of Clostridium perfringens, a bacterium that commonly causes foodborne illness in the United States. \n \n According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), strains of C. perfringens that do not produce epsilon toxin cause nearly a million cases of foodborne illness each year. \n \n C. perfringens is found in soil and contaminated undercooked meats, and previous studies have suggested the bacterium, and epsilon toxin, may play a role in triggering MS. \n \n For instance, in October 2013, Dr. Linden and colleagues reported in the journal PLOS ONE that the soil bacterium might be a trigger for MS when they found C. perfringens type B - a strain that produces epsilon toxin - in a 21-year-old patient suffering from MS. \n \n They further tested their hypothesis by studying the toxin in mice, to see which particular cells it targeted. They found that it targeted not only brain cells, but also cells in other parts of the central nervous system, producing effects only seen in MS patients, as Dr. Linden explains: \n \n \"Originally, we only thought that epsilon toxin would target the brain endothelium cells and oligodendrocytes; we just happened to notice that it also bound to and killed meningeal cells. This was exciting because it provides a possible explanation for meningeal inflammation and subpial cortical lesions exclusively observed in MS patients, but not fully understood.\" \n \n When they tested 37 local food samples, the researchers found 13.5% of them contained C. perfringens and 2.7% contained the epsilon toxin gene. \n \n If further studies confirm these findings, Dr. Linden says it suggests a vaccine that neutralizes the ability of epsilon toxin to trigger MS could stop the disease progressing, or perhaps even prevent it. ||||| Image copyright SPL Image caption Some strains of clostridium secrete toxins \n \n A food poisoning bacterium may be implicated in MS, say US researchers. \n \n Lab tests in mice by the team from Weill Cornell Medical College revealed a toxin made by a rare strain of Clostridium perfringens caused MS-like damage in the brain. \n \n And earlier work by the same team, published in PLoS ONE, identified the toxin-producing strain of C. perfringens in a young woman with MS. \n \n But experts urge caution, saying more work is needed to explore the link. \n \n Discovering potential causes or triggers for MS could enable us to develop better treatments or even, one day, prevent the condition Dr Susan Kohlhaas , Head of Biomedical Research at the MS Society \n \n No-one knows the exact cause of Multiple sclerosis (MS), but it is likely that a mixture of genetic and environmental factors play a role. It's a neurological condition which affects around 100,000 people in the UK. \n \n Bacteria \n \n C. perfringens, found in soil and contaminated undercooked meat, comes in different strains. \n \n Most cases of human infection occur as food poisoning - diarrhoea and stomach cramps that usually resolve within a day or so. More rarely, the bacterium can cause gas gangrene. \n \n And a particular strain of C. perfringens, Type B, which the Weill team says it identified in a human for the first time, makes a toxin that can travel through blood to the brain. \n \n In their lab studies on rodents the researchers found that the toxin, called epsilon, crossed the blood-brain barrier and killed myelin-producing cells - the typical damage seen in MS. \n \n Lead investigator Jennifer Linden said the findings are important because if it can be confirmed that epsilon toxin is a trigger of MS, a vaccine or antibody against the toxin might be able to halt or prevent this debilitating disease. \n \n She presented the group's latest findings at a meeting of the American Society for Microbiology. \n \n Dr Susan Kohlhaas, Head of Biomedical Research at the MS Society, said: \"Discovering potential causes or triggers for MS could enable us to develop better treatments or even, one day, prevent the condition. This is interesting research but the findings now need to be validated in larger studies to establish if this toxin really is a potential trigger for MS.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Scientists still don't know what causes multiple sclerosis, but new research suggests that a particular strain of food poisoning may play a role, reports the BBC. The food bacterium in question is called Clostridium perfringens, which NBC News notes is responsible for millions of cases of foodborne illnesses per year, often through undercooked meat. A rare strain of it produces a toxin called epsilon, and the researches found that this toxin attacks the brain in the same way that MS does. \u201cTo me, if you were going to design a trigger for this disease, this would really fit the mold really well,\u201d says a researcher at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. He adds that it's far too early to conclude that the toxin causes MS, only that it appears to activate it. If further study backs up the finding, it could theoretically lead to a vaccine that prevents MS, says another of the Weill Cornell researchers quoted in Medical News Today.",

(Associated Press) \n \n Security forces are seen outside the Media Park in Hilversum, Netherlands, Thursday, Jan. 29, 2015. A gunman entered the headquarters of Dutch national broadcaster NOS outside Amsterdam on Thursday and... (Associated Press) \n \n NOS was off-air for around an hour. When it came back, it showed recorded footage of the young man, wearing a black suit, white shirt and black tie, and carrying a pistol. \n \n Speaking calmly to someone off-camera, the man said, \"We are hired in by intelligence agencies.\" Shortly after, police arrived with their guns drawn and ordered the man to drop his weapon and put his hands up. At least five police officers then ordered him to turn around and lie down, which he did and he was arrested without a struggle. \n \n Police said in a statement the man demanded airtime and threatened that bombs would go off at several locations around the Netherlands if his demand wasn't met. Special police units were searching the building. \n \n Prosecutor Johan Bac, who spoke at a news conference in Hilversum, said the suspect was from the small town of Pijnacker near The Hague. Bac said he was being held on suspicion of making a threat, weapons possession and taking a hostage. The suspect's name wasn't released by the prosecutor. \n \n Officials said they were still investigating the man's background and the seriousness of the threat he posed. \n \n \"There is a major investigation underway to get clarity as quickly as possible about what happened here tonight,\" Bac said. \n \n There was no immediate indication that the incident was related to Islamic extremism.

It was unclear how he passed through security, which was increased after the attacks in Paris earlier this month. \n \n Footage aired on Dutch TV showed the man pacing in the studio with a black pistol behind his back. \n \n He had intended to speak to the country on the most popular evening news broadcast, but was led to an empty studio by a quick-thinking security guard. \n \n \"This is taking too long,\" the man said.

They refused to comment on media reports that he was a student whose parents had recently died and that he was not on a watchlist of Islamist militants. \n \n He was being questioned and could be charged with kidnapping, possession of a firearm and threatening people with a weapon, prosecutor Johan Bac said at a press conference. \n \n No one was hurt, but the NOS television broadcaster cancelled its two main nightly newscasts. \n \n The man's motive was unclear; the NOS footage showed him saying, \"The things that are going to be said (pause) those are very large world affairs.

The police were looking into claims that he had accomplices around the country with explosives. \n \n \"He took the security guard hostage and said he wanted air time. If they didn't give it to him, he said there would be bombs in different places in the Netherlands that would explode if he didn't get time on TV,\" Scholts said. \n \n The threats were reportedly also contained in a letter that the man took to the studio, a purported copy of which was aired by the RTL news channel. \n \n \"Realise that I am not on my own,\" it said. \"Furthermore, eight high explosives have been planted that contain radioactive material. If you don't take me to studio 8 to make my broadcast, we will be forced to step into action.\" \n \n Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the letter. \n \n Dutch Minister for Security and Justice Ivo Opstelten told the ANP national news agency the man appeared to have acted alone. \n \n Security has been tightened across Europe since jihadist attacks on the offices of the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket in Paris this month, as well as the killing of two gunmen in Belgium during raids on an Islamist group that authorities said were planning to attack police. \n \n NOS television said the gunman appeared to be a student who had recently lost both parents.

But the creatures are prohibited from entry because they are deemed a highly invasive pest that pose a serious threat to U.S. agriculture, the environment and public health, the agency said. \n \n According to Customs and Border Protection, the giant snails can consume more than 500 types of plants, and will even munch on the exterior of homes if fruits and vegetables are not available. They also can carry several parasites harmful to humans, including one that can lead to meningitis, Harty said. \n \n After they were intercepted by customs officials at the airport on July 1, specimens were sent to a local U.S. Department of Agriculture lab and then on to USDA mollusk specialists in Washington for further examination. \n \n Experts identified the creatures as belonging to the giant African snail species, known by the scientific name Archachatina marginata. They also are commonly referred to as giant African land snails, West African snails, West African land snails or banana rasp snails. \n \n Each of the mollusks, with striated brownish-orange shells, can easily fill the palm of a person's hand. They can grow up to 8 inches (20 cm) in length and may live up to 10 years in the wild, experts say. \n \n The entire collection confiscated at the airport was eventually turned over to the USDA, which disposed of the snails through incineration, although no garlic or butter was used, Harty said.

It\u2019s the state\u2019s first lead toxicity cases involving dogs in five years. \n \n \u201cHere in Michigan, specifically in Genesse County, we\u2019ve had two cases of high-lead levels reported to us in dogs in the last six months,\u201d State Veterinarian Dr. James Averill told WWJ\u2019s Chrystal Knight. \u201cOne was last fall and one was here in January. \u2026 One was a stray dog and the other was a family animal.\u201d \n \n Both dogs are still alive, although officials haven\u2019t disclosed whether the dogs were drinking Flint water, how much lead was in their systems or what symptoms they were showing. \n \n \u201cThere is no regular testing for lead,\u201d said Averill. \u201cWhat we do is we rely on the veterinarians who have the boots on the ground that are interacting with their clients and looking at the patients in front of them. When they are concerned or suspect a lead toxicity may be possible, they let us know at that time and then we work with them moving forward from there.\u201d \n \n Averill said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of tests for lead in dogs in the area have been negative amid Flint\u2019s crisis with lead-tainted water. \n \n \u201cDogs are at a higher risk amongst mammals for finding high lead levels, but it\u2019s not that common. Typically for us when we deal with lead toxicity, we\u2019re usually dealing with cattle. So, really this was a new instance for us,\u201d he said. \n \n To protect your pets, Averill said residents in Genesee County should \u201cdo what you are doing for yourself for your pet.\u201d \n \n \u201cSo number one, get your water tested to see if you have high lead levels. Two, if necessary, get a filter in place and then water your pets through that filtered water,\u201d he said. \u201cTake the same steps that you would for yourself for your pets.\u201d \n \n Averill said the first sign that your pet might be suffering from lead poisoning is any deviation from their normal behavior. \n \n \u201cI think the key thing is, as pet owners you know what is the normal routine for your pet,\u201d he said. \u201cSo what pet owners need to be looking for is the animal having their normal behavior in their normal routine, as they are creatures of habit.\u201d \n \n The next step would be bringing your concerns to a local veterinarian, who can further decode what is going on with your pet. \n \n \u201cThe signs and symptoms of lead toxicity are very broad and general, and similar to so many other diseases that a veterinarian needs to work up the case and do things to determine if it\u2019s lead toxicity or if it\u2019s something else,\u201d said Averill. \u201cFor example, vomiting can be caused by many things. So it\u2019s really critical that people work with a veterinarian when a pet has gone outside their normal routine.\u201d \n \n Anyone who notices their pets acting strangely is encouraged to take them to a veterinarian. \n \n TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2016 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

Their test results were confirmed in October 2015 and January 2016, but state officials declined to release further details about the cases \u2014 including whether they live in Flint. \n \n Both were in Genesee County, where high levels of the heavy metal in Flint's tap water system are a major crisis. Officials in Flint continue to advise that people and their pets avoid drinking unfiltered tap water. \n \n \"The confidentiality of the owners is like medical information in humans,\" Averill said. \n \n These were the first two dogs to be confirmed with lead toxicity in the past five years, according to state records. Officials have not disclosed whether they were drinking Flint water, how much lead was in their systems, what symptoms they were showing, their weight or how old they are. \n \n Dr. James Averill, State Veterinarian within MDARD's Animal Industry Division. (Photo: Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development) \n \n \"(The state) does provide reportable disease/condition case information down to the county level, but cannot provide the specifics of those individual cases,\" according to an email from Jennifer Holton, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. The email cites the Animal Industry Act of 1988 for keeping information in the cases hidden from the public. \n \n The state is in contact with area veterinarians, and the \"vast majority\" of tests for lead in dogs has been negative, Averill said. But people who notice their pets acting unusual are encouraged to see their veterinarian. \n \n If a veterinarian determines a dog may have lead toxicity, the lab testing is provided free of charge, he said. And the number of requests has been increasing. But Averill also said that symptoms can vary widely. \n \n \"The thing with lead toxicity in animals, their clinical signs, they're so similar to so many other diseases,\" he said. \n \n Dr. Michael Merrithew, a veterinarian for about 43 years, works at Veterinary House Call Services and Clinic in Grand Blanc, near Flint. He said he's not seen any recent cases he'd attribute to lead, but he's told his staff to watch for symptoms. \n \n Among the possibilities, \"mental dullness,\" possibly arthritis, \"probably general malaise first,\" he said. \n \n Averill said to watch for deviations from routines. \n \n \"My dog, when I get up in the morning, the first thing he wants to do is get up and go to the bathroom,\" he said. \"(Pet owners) know their animals. And when they're not their normal selves, tell them to seek veterinary care.\" \n \n Dr. Lawrence Ehrman, a veterinarian for about 33 years, works at Veterinary Medical Hospital in Flint Township. He also said he doesn't appear to have had any recent patients with lead toxicity, but lead poisoning from water can be more challenging to determine. \n \n \"What we're dealing with here is not like an acute poisoning. It's more a chronic sort of thing,\" he said. \"It can cause brain and mental issues, blood issues and even some digestive and kidney issues, though they're much less common.\" \n \n He said changes in attitude or signs of weakness could be symptoms of lead toxicity. \n \n Averill said it's OK to bathe pets in Flint's tap water, but they should only be drinking filtered or bottled water. Since 2011, all the other cases of lead in animals have involved cattle. \n \n Ehrman said that for people who don't immediately have bottled or filtered water available for their pets, there's an alternative. \n \n \"Probably melt some snow,\" he said. \"And it would be safer, if your only other choice is feeding them straight Flint water.\" \n \n Follow Robert Allen on Twitter: @rallenMI \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1X7hCq4",

Both dogs are alive, Averill notes, but the state report doesn't specify how high their lead levels were, or what symptoms they had. And indeed, it's challenging to diagnose dogs with lead toxicity, as symptoms such as \"mental dullness,\" arthritis, and lethargy can mimic those of other illnesses, Averill says. Instead, he mentions keeping an eye on variations in a pet's routine to help pinpoint if something's wrong. He does note to CBS, however, that the \"vast majority\" of lead tests on area dogs have come back negative, and he says they're relying on local veterinarians with \"boots on the ground\" to look out for suspicious cases. In the meantime, while Averill gives the OK to bathe pets in Flint-area tap water, he says they should be drinking filtered or bottled water or, as a last resort, melted snow. \"It would be safer, if your only other choice is feeding them straight Flint water,\" he notes.

A new... (Associated Press) \n \n Most of the 370,000 children in Fukushima prefecture (state) have been given ultrasound checkups since the March 2011 meltdowns at the tsunami-ravaged Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant. The most recent statistics, released in August, show that thyroid cancer is suspected or confirmed in 137 of those children, a number that rose by 25 from a year earlier. Elsewhere, the disease occurs in only about one or two of every million children per year by some estimates. \n \n \"This is more than expected and emerging faster than expected,\" lead author Toshihide Tsuda told The Associated Press during a visit to Tokyo. \"This is 20 times to 50 times what would be normally expected.\" \n \n The study was released online this week and is being published in the November issue of Epidemiology, produced by the Herndon, Virginia-based International Society for Environmental Epidemiology. The data comes from tests overseen by Fukushima Medical University. \n \n Making sense of the relationship between radiation and cancer is precarious: It's scientifically impossible to link an individual cancer case to radiation. Looking harder with routine check-ups, like the one in Fukushima, leads to quicker discovery of tumors, inflating the tallies in a so-called \"screening effect.\" \n \n Right after the disaster, the lead doctor brought in to Fukushima, Shunichi Yamashita, repeatedly ruled out the possibility of radiation-induced illnesses. The thyroid checks were being ordered just to play it safe, according to the government. \n \n But Tsuda, a professor at Okayama University, said the latest results from the ultrasound checkups, which continue to be conducted, raise doubts about the government's view. \n \n Thyroid cancer among children is one sickness the medical world has definitively linked to radiation after the 1986 Chernobyl catastrophe. If treated, it is rarely fatal, and early detection is a plus, but patients are on medication for the rest of their lives. \n \n Scientists are divided on Tsuda's conclusions. \n \n In the same Epidemiology issue, Scott Davis, professor at the Department of Epidemiology in the Seattle-based School of Public Health, said the key limitation of Tsuda's study is the lack of individual-level data to estimate actual radiation doses. \n \n Davis agreed with the findings of the World Health Organization and UNSCEAR, or the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, both of which have carried out reviews on Fukushima and predicted cancer rates will remain stable, with no rises being discernable as radiation-caused. \n \n David J. Brenner, professor of radiation biophysics at Columbia University Medical Center, took a different view. While he agreed individual estimates on radiation doses are needed, he said in a telephone interview that the higher thyroid cancer rate in Fukushima is \"not due to screening. It's real.\" \n \n Conclusions about any connection between Fukushima radiation and cancer will help determine compensation and other policies. Many people who live in areas deemed safe by the government have fled fearing sickness, especially for their children. \n \n An area extending about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the nuclear plant has been declared an exclusion zone. The borders are constantly being remapped as cleanup of radiated debris and soil continues in an effort to bring as many people back as possible. Decommissioning the plant is expected to take decades. \n \n Noriko Matsumoto, 53, who used to work as a nurse in Koriyama, Fukushima, outside the no-go zone, fled to Tokyo with her then-11-year-old daughter a few months after the disaster. She had initially shrugged off the fears but got worried when her daughter started getting nosebleeds and rashes. \n \n \"My daughter has the right to live free of radiation,\" she said. \"We can never be sure about blaming radiation. But I personally feel radiation is behind sicknesses.\" \n \n Andrew F. Olshan, professor at the Department of Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina, in Chapel Hill, noted that research on what follows a catastrophe is complex and difficult. \n \n \"Dr. Tsuda's study had limitations including assessment of individual radiation dose levels to the thyroid and the ability to fully assess the impact of screening on the excess cases detected,\" he said. \n \n \"Nonetheless, this study is critical to initiate additional investigations of possible health effects, for governmental planning, and increasing public awareness.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Yuri Kageyama: http://twitter.com/yurikageyama ||||| Background: After the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in March 2011, radioactive elements were released from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Based on prior knowledge, concern emerged about whether an increased incidence of thyroid cancer among exposed residents would occur as a result. \n \n Methods: After the release, Fukushima Prefecture performed ultrasound thyroid screening on all residents ages <=18 years. The first round of screening included 298,577 examinees, and a second round began in April 2014. We analyzed the prefecture results from the first and second round up to December 31, 2014, in comparison with the Japanese annual incidence and the incidence within a reference area in Fukushima Prefecture. \n \n Results: The highest incidence rate ratio, using a latency period of 4 years, was observed in the central middle district of the prefecture compared with the Japanese annual incidence (incidence rate ratio = 50; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 25, 90). The prevalence of thyroid cancer was 605 per million examinees (95% CI = 302, 1,082) and the prevalence odds ratio compared with the reference district in Fukushima Prefecture was 2.6 (95% CI = 0.99, 7.0). In the second screening round, even under the assumption that the rest of examinees were disease free, an incidence rate ratio of 12 has already been observed (95% CI = 5.1, 23). \n \n Conclusions: An excess of thyroid cancer has been detected by ultrasound among children and adolescents in Fukushima Prefecture within 4 years of the release, and is unlikely to be explained by a screening surge. \n \n This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Fukushima Medical University took the lead in \n \n planning and implementing this survey. The primary purposes of this survey are to monitor the long-term health of \n \n residents, promote their future well-being, and confirm whether long-term low-dose radiation exposure has health \n \n effects. \n \n Survey population \n \n The Fukushima Health Management Survey consists of a basic survey and 4 detailed surveys, namely, the thyroid ultrasound examination, comprehensive health check, mental health and lifestyle survey, and pregnancy and birth survey. The target population of the basic survey is about 2.05 million. To be selected for the basic survey, individuals had to be either a registered resident of Fukushima Prefecture during the period of 11 March to 1 July (including those evacuated or transferred to residence registration in another prefecture); a resident of Fukushima Prefecture who was registered in another prefecture during the period of 11 March to 1 July; a resident of another prefecture who commuted to Fukushima Prefecture during the period of 11 March to 1 July; or a resident of another prefecture who temporarily stayed in Fukushima Prefecture during the period of 11 March to 25 March. The detailed surveys targeted selected people on the basis of the particular criteria used for each survey. \n \n External exposure dose, as indicated on the basic survey, and information from the detailed surveys will be linked and maintained in the database for later analysis. \n \n Basic Survey \n \n The Basic Survey is a questionnaire targeting roughly 2,050,000 residents of and visitors to Fukushima Prefecture as of 11 March 2011. Estimated external radiation doses were calculated based on recorded movements of respondents in the four months following the nuclear accident. \n \n Detailed Surveys \n \n Thyroid Ultrasound Examination: The examination covers roughly 360,000 residents aged 0 to 18 years at the time of the nuclear accident. The initial screening is to be performed within the first three years after the accident, followed by complete thyroid examinations from 2014 onwards, and the residents will be monitored regularly thereafter. \n \n Comprehensive Health Check: The program aims at early detection and treatment of diseases as well as prevention of lifestyle-related diseases. Its main target includes 210,000 former residents of evacuation zones whose lifestyle changed drastically after the accident. Additional tests such as differential leukocyte count are performed apart from the routine tests included in the general medical check-up at the workplace or by the local government. \n \n Mental Health and Lifestyle Survey: The survey aims to provide adequate care mainly for evacuees who are at a higher risk of developing mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and stress. \n \n Pregnancy and Birth Survey: The survey aids in providing appropriate medical care and support to mothers who were given a Maternal and Child Health Handbook between 1 August 2010 and 31 July 2011 and to their children. ||||| Fukushima Study Links Children's Cancer To Nuclear Accident \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Chris Meyers/Reuters/Landov Chris Meyers/Reuters/Landov \n \n Updated at 3:40 p.m. ET \n \n A new analysis of data from Fukushima suggests children exposed to the March 2011 nuclear accident may be developing thyroid cancer at an elevated rate. \n \n But independent experts say that the study, published in the journal Epidemiology, has numerous shortcomings and does not prove a link between the accident and cancer. \n \n The work, led by Toshihide Tsuda of Okayama University, is based on a large public health survey that was set up in Japan's Fukushima prefecture following the accident. As part of the survey, children who were living near the plant at the time of the accident have been offered regular thyroid screenings. \n \n Thyroid cancer can be caused by radioactive iodine released in a nuclear accident. Children are particularly susceptible because their thyroids are growing rapidly. Thyroid cancer was listed as a possible health risk in a World Health Organization report on Fukushima, though the report stated it would be difficult to link cancer cases to the accident. \n \n In the past year or so, the Fukushima Health Survey of more than 150,000 children has turned up 25 \"suspicious or malignant cases\" of thyroid cancer. Thyroid screenings in previous years have also found numerous cases. \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Wally Santana/AP Wally Santana/AP \n \n Japanese officials believe the screening process itself may be behind the numbers. Increased vigilance might be turning up thyroid abnormalities that otherwise would have gone undetected. \n \n But the new paper contradicts that view. The increase in cancer is \"unlikely to be caused by a screening surge,\" the paper says. It says thyroid cancer rates are highly elevated throughout Fukushima. \n \n Other researchers are skeptical of the new result. Geraldine Thomas, a professor at Imperial College who has studied thyroid cancer from Chernobyl, says the analysis incorrectly compares the screening in Fukushima to clinical cases of thyroid cancer in which patients are already sick. The comparison falsely suggests thyroid cancer in Fukushima is elevated by as much as 50 times compared with the general population. \"This is not a very good paper to be basing opinions on,\" she says. \n \n More accurate comparisons between residents within different parts of Fukushima prefecture show no statistically significant variations in cancer rates, she says. \n \n David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University, adds that the study makes no effort to trace the exposure of patients. \"It's simply relating geographic regions to cancer risks and not looking at individual radiation doses,\" he says, adding that without that information, it's virtually impossible to connect the screenings to the accident. \n \n \"It really doesn't tell us the whole story,\" he says.",

Per a study being published in the November issue of Epidemiology, of the 370,000 or so kids 18 and under in the Fukushima region who received thyroid exams since the disaster, 137 of them have suspected or confirmed cases of thyroid cancer, a number that rose by 25 from last year, the AP notes. \"This is more than expected and emerging faster than expected,\" lead author Toshihide Tsuda tells the AP.

Tsuda and his team claim that the numbers aren't simply the result of a \"screening effect\"\u2014in which more routine checkups like the ones in Fukushima have simply found tumors earlier and more often\u2014as the Japanese government has suggested. Other experts, however, aren't so sure how accurate Tsuda's study is and note the complexity of studying such an issue. The director for Columbia University's Center for Radiological Research, for example, tells NPR that just tying certain geographic areas to higher cancer rates doesn't prove anything without looking at individual radiation exposure, a claim that's echoed in a report by the World Health Organization.(The residents of the Japanese town of Nahara are finally allowed back\u2014but many don't want to go.)",

Would you want to see a ban on the fan traditions in your country?\" A recent survey found that the sound emitted by a vuvuzela was the equivalent to 127 decibels - louder than a drum's 122 decibels or a referee's whistle at 121.8 decibels.

Portugal star Ronaldo is the latest World Cup star to voice unease about the instrument. \"It is difficult for anyone on the pitch to concentrate,\" said the Real Madrid forward. \"A lot of players don't like them but they are going to have to get used to them.\" France captain Patrice Evra blamed the noise generated by the vuvuzelas for his side's poor showing in their opening group game against Uruguay, which finished goalless. He added: \"We can't sleep at night because of the vuvuzelas. People start playing them from 6am. \"We can't hear one another out on the pitch because of them.\" Backing for the under-fire vuvuzela has come from the England Supporters' Band, which has not missed an England game - home or away - since 1996.

But Hemmingham, who was at Saturday's game between England and the United States in Rustenburg, revealed: \"We didn't have any problem. \"The fans around us were all singing along and a lot of our fans were joining in with us using their vuvuzelas.

But organisers said that the vuvuzela, one of the most visible and certainly most audible motifs of the tournament's opening weekend, could yet be banned from inside stadiums. \n \n Organising committee chief executive Danny Jordaan said he would continue to monitor their use and that a ban could be enforced if there were \"grounds to do so\". \n \n Fifa and organisers have already said that they will ban the instrument if any are thrown onto the pitch or used as a weapon and urged fans not to blow them during national anthems. \n \n \"We did say that if any land on the pitch in anger we will take action. We've tried to get some order. We have asked for no vuvuzelas during national anthems or stadium announcements. It's difficult but we're trying to manage the best we can,\" he told the BBC. \n \n \"We've had some broadcasters and individuals [complaining] and it's something we are evaluating on an on-going basis.\" The BBC and ITV have received complaints from viewers about the background noise and, while both have said they will monitor the situation, they have also made the point that it is important to reflect the atmosphere of the tournament. \n \n Fifa has previously shrugged off complaints from broadcasters, players and coaches about the noise from the plastic horns that are being sold on every street corner in South African host cities. \n \n Following last year's Confederations Cup, there were complaints from coaches, players and broadcasters about the noise. But Fifa said that the horns formed part of the unique African atmosphere of the tournament and refused to ban them. \n \n But Jordaan himself, who battled for 16 years to bring the World Cup to South Africa, said he would prefer the 10 stadiums hosting the World Cup to ring to the sound of singing and dancing than the drone of the vuvuzela. \n \n \"I would prefer singing. It's always been a great generator of a wonderful atmosphere in stadiums and I would try to encourage them to sing,\" he said. \n \n \"In the days of the struggle (against apartheid) we were singing, all through our history it's our ability to sing that inspired and drove the emotions.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The nonstop drone of plastic horns has been the soundtrack of the World Cup so far, on and off the field, and they're so annoying that FIFA is considering a ban. It can't come soon enough for some. \"We can't sleep at night because of the vuvuzelas.\" the French captain tells the BBC. \"We can't hear one another out on the pitch because of them.\" The cacophony isn't exactly music to the ears of the head of the organizing committee, which has already threatened to keep the omnipresent vuvuzelas out if any are thrown onto the pitch or used violently, reports the Guardian. \"I would prefer singing,\" Danny Jordaan acknowledges. \"It's always been a great generator of a wonderful atmosphere in stadiums and I would try to encourage them to sing.\"",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 World Cup organizers say they will not ban vuvuzelas from stadiums in South Africa, despite numerous complaints. The sound of the plastic horn has been likened to the drone of a thousand bees or a herd of stampeding elephants, reports the BBC. Portugal winger Cristiano Ronaldo says the noise affects player concentration, while some fans watching on television claim they cannot hear the commentary. But a World Cup spokesman insisted vuvuvelas are \"ingrained in the history of South Africa\" and will remain. England defender Jamie Carragher said the noise did not bother him when he came on as a half-time substitute during the 1-1 draw with the US and he said he had already bought two to take home to his children in Liverpool.",

    "document": "Two bills that would increase restrictions on North Dakota\u2019s abortion laws are headed to the governor\u2019s desk after passage by the Senate on Friday. \n \n If signed, the bills would create some of the toughest abortion laws in the nation. \n \n House Bill 1305 would make it a Class A misdemeanor for a physician to willingly perform an abortion based specifically on gender or on genetic abnormalities. \n \n House Bill 1456 requires a physician to determine whether there\u2019s a detectable heartbeat prior to performing an abortion. A physician who willingly performs an abortion after the detection of a heartbeat could be subject to a Class C felony. \n \n HB1456, if signed by Gov. Jack Dalrymple, would enact the earliest abortion restriction in the nation. Heartbeats have been detected as early as approximately six weeks after conception. \n \n \u201cThe time has come to choose life,\u201d said Sen. Spencer Berry, R-Fargo, who spoke briefly in favor of HB1456. No further debate followed before the Senate passed the bill 26-17. \n \n Opponents of the bill in past hearings have pointed to federal law that protects abortions up to where an unborn child can survive outside the womb, approximately 24 weeks. \n \n The potential six-week mark is even stricter than a bill passed by the Arkansas Legislature that enacts a near-ban after 12 weeks. A federal court earlier this month overturned an Idaho law banning abortions after 20 weeks. \n \n Nearly all of Friday\u2019s debate was centered on HB1305, which passed by a 28-15 vote minutes earlier. \n \n The debate included emotional appeals and personal stories from senators, as well as a brief delay during floor votes on two divided portions of the bill when a Democratic member of the Senate left the chamber. \n \n Sen. Connie Triplett, D-Grand Forks, was later excused, but her departure drew a rebuke from the majority leader and a warning for senators not to do that in the future. \n \n Sen. Margaret Sitte, R-Bismarck, introduced HB1305, calling on her Senate colleagues to vote against what she called sex discrimination. \n \n \u201cThis gender-cide has led to ... a well-documented gender gap,\u201d Sitte said. \n \n Sen. Carolyn Nelson, D-Fargo, disputed Sitte\u2019s claim of gender-based abortions in North Dakota. She said the issue of such abortions stems from the Chinese law restricting couples living in urban areas to one child. \n \n \u201cWe don\u2019t live in China. We live in North Dakota. This is not a problem in North Dakota,\u201d Nelson said. \n \n According to records from the state\u2019s only abortion facility, there have been no instances of an abortion being performed for gender reasons, she said. \n \n Minority Leader Mac Schneider, D-Grand Forks, then asked to have HB1305 split into two parts for separate votes before voting on the final bill. The motion was approved. \n \n The bill was divided, with one section removing the wording about genetic abnormalities. \n \n Berry said allowing sex-selective abortions and those based on genetic abnormalities is a path down the \u201cslippery slope of eugenics.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe get in a dangerous area for future precedent,\u201d Berry said. \n \n Triplett called the comparison to China \u201csilly\u201d and called the Legislature\u2019s attempt to govern women\u2019s bodies \u201can abomination.\u201d \n \n She said the Chinese law was passed to address a fear of rapidly rising population and a consequence was that couples would have sons overwhelmingly. When the law was enacted in the late 1970s, only men could own property, she said. \n \n Sitte said abortion providers can claim that no abortions are being conducted based on gender \u201cbecause they don\u2019t have to give a reason.\u201d \n \n She said North Dakota was a leader in passing its anti-discrimination laws and HB1305 boils down to a question of discrimination. \n \n \u201cIs it right to discriminate against a human being?\u201d Sitte said. \n \n Before the first vote was taken, Triplett left the chamber. After brief discussion on Senate rules relating to absences and voting, Triplett was excused so the vote could proceed. The first part of the bill then passed by a 37-6 vote. \n \n Sen. Terry Wanzek, R-Jamestown, spoke about the second section, which stripped the reference to genetic abnormalities from the bill. He noted that his sister was born with a genetic abnormality and said nothing about her makes her life less valuable. \n \n \u201cThese are special people here for a special purpose,\u201d Wanzek said. \n \n The second part of the bill also passed, and the full HB1305 then passed by a 28-15 vote. \n \n Before the Senate adjourned, Majority Leader Rich Wardner, R-Dickinson, told members that Senate rules require those who are on the floor and in attendance to vote. He said absences can be excused only by first checking with the leader of the senator\u2019s party and that the absent senator must have a legitimate excuse. \n \n Wardner told his colleagues that if any of them are thinking of leaving as Triplett did, they should \u201cget it out of your mind.\u201d If that happens, he said, the Senate will wait for them to return. ||||| Little more than a week after Arkansas adopted the country\u2019s most stringent abortion limits , banning the procedure at 12 weeks of pregnancy , the North Dakota Legislature on Friday passed a more restrictive bill that would ban most abortions as early as 6 weeks into pregnancy. \n \n The Legislature, which is dominated by Republicans, also passed a second measure that would ban abortions sought because of a genetic abnormality or to select the sex of the child. \n \n Both bills must be signed by Gov. Jack Dalrymple, a Republican, to become law. As of Friday afternoon, the governor had not said whether he would do so. \n \n No other state has barred abortions because of evidence that a fetus has a genetic defect like Down syndrome, which rises in incidence with maternal age, leading many pregnant women to seek tests for the disorder. Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and Arizona have all banned abortions for the purpose of gender selection. \n \n National abortion rights groups, including the Center for Reproductive Rights, Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, condemned the measures that passed the North Dakota Senate on Friday, after previous approval by the House. These groups warned that if adopted, both measures would be declared unconstitutional by federal courts. \n \n Under Supreme Court rulings, women have a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb, generally around 24 weeks into pregnancy. \n \n \u201cWe urge the governor to veto all of these bills to ensure that this personal and private decision can be made by a woman and her family, not politicians sitting in the Capitol,\u201d said Jennifer Dalven, the director of the A.C.L.U.\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project. \n \n One of the newly passed North Dakota bills outlaws abortions when a fetal heartbeat is \u201cdetectable\u201d using \u201cstandard medical practice.\u201d Heartbeats are often detectable at about 6 weeks, using an intrusive transvaginal ultrasound, or at about 10 to 12 weeks when using abdominal ultrasounds. \n \n The bill does not specify a time threshold or whether doctors with a patient in the initial weeks of pregnancy must use the transvaginal probe. A proposed law in Virginia last year that would have required use of the transvaginal ultrasound caused a national outcry, and the bill was ultimately shelved. Arkansas declared a 12-week limit specifically to avoid that controversy. \n \n But some experts said that doctors in North Dakota, which has only one clinic performing abortions, in Fargo, could face prosecution if they did not use the vaginal ultrasound when necessary to detect a heartbeat. Doctors who knowingly perform abortions in violation of the measure, if it is adopted, could be charged with a felony that carries a five-year prison sentence; the patients would not face criminal charges. \n \n The law makes exceptions for abortion to save the life of the mother or for other severe medical emergencies, but not in cases of rape or incest. \n \n In 2011, according to state data, 1,247 abortions were performed in North Dakota. If the ban becomes law, more than 75 percent of the procedures could be outlawed, according to Elizabeth Nash, a state issues manager with the Guttmacher Institute in Washington, a research group that supports abortion rights. \n \n The early abortion ban was sponsored by Representative Bette Grande, a Republican from Fargo. \n \n \u201cA heartbeat is accepted by everyone as a sign of life,\u201d she said in a blog posting on Tuesday as she argued that it was time for the Supreme Court to revisit the definition of viability. ||||| North Dakota on Friday moved closer to adopting what would be the most restrictive abortion laws in the country, with lawmakers sending the Republican governor measures that could set the state up for a costly legal battle over the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized the procedure. \n \n North Dakota state Sen.

The North Dakota Senate approved two anti-abortion bills Friday, March 15, 2013,... (Associated Press) \n \n The North Dakota Senate overwhelmingly approved two anti-abortion bills Friday, one banning abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy and another prohibiting women from having the procedure because a fetus has a genetic defect, such as Down syndrome. North Dakota would be the first state in the U.S. to adopt such laws. \n \n Supporters said their goal is to challenge the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion up until a fetus is considered viable, usually at 22 to 24 weeks, though anti-abortion activists elsewhere have expressed concern about the strategy. \n \n \"It's a good day for babies,\" said Rep. Bette Grande, a Republican from Fargo who introduced both bills. The state's only abortion clinic is in Fargo, and abortion-rights advocates say the measures are meant to shut it down. \n \n Gov. Jack Dalrymple hasn't said anything to indicate he would veto the measures, and the bills have enough support in each chamber for the Legislature to override him. \n \n Debate Friday was brief, with the Senate taking about an hour to pass both measures. No one spoke against the so-called fetal heartbeat bill, which the Senate took up immediately after passing the genetic abnormalities bill. The votes were largely on party lines, with Republicans supporting the measures and Democrats opposing them. \n \n Opponents, who have promised legal challenges to both measures if they become law, urged Dalrymple to veto the bills. North Dakota is one of several states with Republican-controlled Legislatures and GOP governors that is looking at abortion restrictions. But the state is better positioned than most for a long court fight: It has budget surplus nearing $2 billion thanks to new-found oil wealth. \n \n The American Civil Liberties Union called the measures \"extreme,\" saying they would make North Dakota \"the first state in the nation to ban most abortions.\" \n \n \"In America, no woman, no matter where she lives, should be denied the ability to make this deeply personal decision,\" ACLU executive director Anthony Romero said in a statement. \n \n Arkansas passed a 12-week ban earlier this month that prohibits most abortions when a fetal heartbeat can be detected using an abdominal ultrasound. That ban is scheduled to take effect 90 days after the Arkansas Legislature adjourns. \n \n A fetal heartbeat can generally be detected earlier in a pregnancy using a vaginal ultrasound, but Arkansas lawmakers balked at requiring women seeking abortions to have the more invasive imaging technique. \n \n North Dakota's measure doesn't specify how a fetal heartbeat would be detected. Doctors performing an abortion after a heartbeat is detected could face a felony charge punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine. Women having an abortion would not face charges. \n \n While some abortion opponents welcomed Arkansas' new law as a bold challenge to Roe v. Wade, others favor more incremental strategies, fearing such bans could lead to emphatic rejections in court. \n \n A similar fetal heartbeat bill was debated by Ohio lawmakers last year before being blocked by the Senate president. The measure, which could be revived this year, fractured Ohio's anti-abortion movement in a debate over its tactical effectiveness. \n \n Grande told lawmakers that fears about a legal challenge shouldn't prevent them from approving the North Dakota measure. \n \n \"Whether this is challenged in court is entirely up to the abortion industry,\" Grande told lawmakers this week. \"Given the lucrative nature of abortion, it is likely that any statute that reduces the number of customers will be challenged by the industry.\" \n \n During the Senate debate, one senator who had spoken out against the genetic abnormalities bill left the chamber in protest. The move forced the Senate to briefly halt debate, because the chambers rules require senators to be formally excused. The Senate was able to move forward with proceedings on the bill by passing a motion to excuse the senator. \n \n \"It was absolutely a silent protest,\" Sen. Connie Triplett told The Associated Press after the vote. \"North Dakota will have a harder time recruiting and retaining doctors because doctors will not want to be arrested for advising women on abortion issues.\" \n \n Sen. Margaret Sitte, a Republican from Bismarck, said the genetic abnormality bill is meant to ban the destruction of life based on \"an arbitrary society standard of being good enough.\" Some test results pointing to abnormalities are incorrect, she said, and doctors can perform surgeries even before a baby is born to correct some genetic conditions. \n \n Sitte's voice cracked as she described developmentally challenged children she knows. \"Their hugs are tighter, their laughter louder and their empathy more sincere\" than so-called \"normal people,\" she said. \n \n The genetic abnormalities bill also bans abortion based on gender selection. Pennsylvania, Arizona and Oklahoma already have such laws, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks abortion restrictions across the U.S. \n \n The Senate approved the genetic abnormalities bill 27-15; the House vote was 64-27. The Senate approved the fetal heartbeat bill 26-17; the House vote was 63-28. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow James MacPherson on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/macphersonja.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Abortion opponents in North Dakota have one-upped their peers in Arkansas.

Lawmakers picked six weeks because that's when a heartbeat can be detected by transvaginal ultrasound, the intrusive procedure that set off controversy in Virginia last year, reports the New York Times. Arkansas picked 12 weeks because a heartbeat can be detected with an abdominal ultrasound at that point. Assuming the North Dakota bills become law, expect legal challenges to follow. No other state, for example, has a law that outlaws abortions over a genetic defect. Of the 1,247 abortions performed in the state in 2011, 75% would be illegal under the new legislation, according to a research group that backs abortion rights. That could well mean that the state's only abortion clinic, in Fargo, would have to close its doors.",

(Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. workers have been largely insulated from a global slowdown. \n \n Job growth remains steady and wages are finally picking up \u2014 trends that will be put to the test in Friday's employment report for February. \n \n Economists have forecast that employers added a solid 195,000 jobs last month, up from the 151,000 added in January, according to data firm FactSet. And the unemployment rate is expected to remain at a low 4.9 percent. \n \n Hiring by construction companies, retailers and health care providers have offset layoffs at manufacturers and fossil fuel companies \u2014 two sectors squeezed by the pressures of uncertainty in China, sluggishness in Europe, declining oil prices and a stronger dollar. \n \n Consumers have provided the foundation for much of the job market's improvement in what's become something of a self-sustaining cycle. The 2.7 million workers hired in the past 12 months have bolstered spending on autos, housing and meals out. As unemployment has dropped, more companies have begun to raise pay to attract workers, thereby fueling more hiring as people's ability to spend, invest and save has increased. \n \n Friday's jobs report will be closely monitored by the Federal Reserve and presidential candidates as a key gauge of whether the economy is extending its 6\u00bd-year rebound from the Great Recession. \n \n Recent reports point to continued improvement. \n \n Over the past 12 months, average hourly earnings have risen 2.5 percent. Annual pay growth has perked up after having increased at a roughly 2 percent pace in the previous few years. The wage acceleration has prompted optimism among many economists despite the difficulties worldwide. \n \n \"The trend is wage growth is clearly a straight line upward \u2014 I believe we will hit the 3 percent threshold,\" said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at Glassdoor, a jobs marketplace. \n \n The hiring and rising incomes have translated into more consumer spending in several key sectors. \n \n Auto sales rose 7 percent over last February to 1.3 million vehicles, according to Autodata Corp. \n \n Purchases of existing homes rose 0.4 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.47 million, according to the National Association of Realtors. That improvement followed a solid 2015, when sales achieved their highest level in nine years. \n \n And spending at restaurants has risen 6.1 percent over the past 12 months. \n \n Still, troubles abroad have tempered U.S. economic growth. \n \n China, the world's second-largest economy, is struggling with high corporate debts and slower growth. Oil prices have tumbled amid relatively low demand. The strong dollar has crushed exports, while the stock market has dropped in an extended bout of volatility this year. \n \n Mining companies, including oil and gas drillers, have shed 130,600 jobs in the past 12 months. Factories have hired just 45,000 workers from a year ago as job gains in the manufacturing sector have slowed after a strong 2014. \n \n The Fed is looking for further wage growth. The central bank is considering whether to raise interest rates again in the face of global risks that could imperil broader economic growth. In December, the Fed raised rates from record lows \u2014 its first increase in nearly a decade. \n \n Investors have largely dismissed the likelihood of another rate hike at the upcoming Fed meeting March 16-17. ||||| U.S. employers are shrugging off fears of an economic downturn. \n \n The nation\u2019s job growth rebounded in February as nonfarm payrolls rose by 242,000 and the prior two months were revised up by 30,000, the Labor Department said Friday.

Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast the addition of 198,000 nonfarm jobs. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9%. Employment gains for January and December, meanwhile, were revised upward by a combined 30,000, the Labor Department said Friday. The government said 172,000 new jobs were created in January instead of the previously reported 151,000. December's gain was raised to 271,000 from 262,000. Yet despite the big gain in new jobs, the average hourly wage fell 3 cents, or 0.1%, to $25.35. Hourly pay rose a mild 2.2% from February 2015 to February 2016. And the amount of time people worked each week dropped two-tenths of an hour to 34.4 hours, the lowest level in two years. The labor-force participation rate moved up to 62.9%, the highest level since May, as more than half a million people joined the labor force.

Never thought I'd like it, since I'm more of a vegetarian, but I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. First off, it took a bit for me to catch one. Surprised how fast they move, especially with the short legs. Finally caught the hen and promptly gave its neck a quick spin. Honestly, it was not as sad of an experience as I thought it would be. Since I was on someone else's property, I didn't have much time to prepare it so I just dug in. In hindsight, I should have at least plucked the feathers, but aside from that odd texture of flesh and feather... not bad! Probably would be better cooked?

I left everything on my plate and had to go to a different restaurant to get decent food. In my opinion if you visit this location after this review you have no right to be mad if the food is as bad as i bet it will be. Also, i hope that the manager AND cooks of this location go to a restaurant and spend 3 times as much as i did and get burnt food they will have no choice but to pay for it. KARMA.

    "document": "I\u2019ve generally been of the view that the earlier that the Republican primaries and caucuses begin, the better off Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign will be. \n \n This is a pretty straightforward case: Mr. Romney is a well-prepared candidate and leads the field right now according to most polling and non-polling indicators. It isn\u2019t a very large lead, and as Chuck Todd notes, I\u2019d be a little bit careful in anointing any candidate with the \u201cinevitability\u201d label when he\u2019s still polling at just 20 or 25 percent. But it\u2019s a lead nevertheless, and the sooner the voting begins, the less chance there will be for another candidate like Gov. Rick Perry to gain a firmer footing as his campaign gains experience. (Earlier voting dates have also made it much harder for additional candidates like New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to enter the race.) \n \n Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign evidently agrees with this thinking: it pushed for an earlier date for the Nevada caucuses, according to reporting by the Las Vegas Review-Journal and the Des Moines Register, which were recently moved to Jan. 14 from Feb. 18. \n \n But there is one potential wrench the works \u2014 which could cause the plan to blow up on Mr. Romney and harm his chances of winning the nomination. That is if New Hampshire were to move its primary date all the way up to December, as New Hampshire secretary of state Bill Gardner has threatened to do in response to the moves made by Nevada and other states. \n \n New Hampshire\u2019s laws require that the state\u2019s primary be held on a Tuesday, that it occur before any other primary (but not necessarily any other caucus), and that there is a full week\u2019s buffer between it and the next nomination contest. The latest date that would meet these rules is Dec. 27, 2011. But that date, as well as Dec. 20, would come too close to the Christmas holiday, so Mr. Gardner has instead suggested dates of Dec. 6 or Dec. 13. \n \n This would leave New Hampshire as something of an orphan on the schedule. Holding its primary on Dec. 6, for instance, would leave a four-week gap between it and the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 3, during which time much egg nog would be consumed and much of the momentum from the contest might be lost. Some research suggests that the \u201cbounce\u201d from winning an early primary, while it can be significant, tends to evaporate relatively quickly. \n \n Meanwhile, although the first four or five states have moved up their dates, the primary calendar is still fairly back-loaded overall. Based on the dates listed at Josh Putnam\u2019s excellent Web site, Frontloading HQ, the bulk of primaries and caucus are not taking place until March or later, with some important contests like California and New Jersey not scheduled until June. \n \n So chances are that a December date would diminish the importance of New Hampshire from an electoral perspective, both because it is so disconnected from the rest of the calendar and because Mr. Romney\u2019s rivals might have more of an excuse for a poor performance there. Candidates like Mr. Perry and Herman Cain could cite the difficulty of competing in New Hampshire on a compressed schedule, and against a candidate in Mr. Romney who has a residence in the state and is something of a native son. The news media, annoyed that the earlier date would require them to revisit their own plans for the campaign, might be happy to play along. It\u2019s hard to know exactly how the spin war would unfold, but it\u2019s possible that New Hampshire could come to be regarded as something of a curiosity or even a beauty contest. \n \n Now consider how these scenarios might play out given the rest of the calendar. First, imagine that we had a schedule like in 2008, with Iowa voting in the first week of January and New Hampshire about a week later. A loss in Iowa would not be good news for Mr. Romney \u2014 particularly given that in the past, New Hampshire has shown something of a penchant for underdog, up-and-coming candidates. Still, New Hampshire would represent a hedge or buffer for Mr. Romney, and a win there would allow his campaign to recover from any loss in momentum. \n \n If New Hampshire were already to have voted in December, however, the sting of a poor performance from Mr. Romney in Iowa could linger. While the next voting contest \u2014 Nevada on Jan. 14 \u2014 would still be a relatively good one for Mr. Romney because of the high number of Mormons there, he\u2019d be more likely to enter the contest with unfavorable rater than favorable momentum. By the time Nevada voted, and South Carolina voted the following week, any gains Mr. Romney might have made by winning New Hampshire in December would long have been forgotten about. \n \n Fortunately for Mr. Romney, there is a relatively elegant solution to this problem. Although Mr. Gardner has threatened the \u201cnuclear option\u201d of moving his state\u2019s primary to December, he ultimately isn\u2019t asking for all that much. If Nevada moved its caucus date to Tuesday, Jan. 17 from Saturday, Jan. 14 \u2014 just a 72-hour shift \u2014 New Hampshire\u2019s statutory requirements would allow it to slot in on Jan. 10, giving us a January calendar that very much resembled the one we had in 2008. \n \n If Mr. Romney\u2019s campaign had significant enough influence on Nevada to compel it to move its caucus to January in the first place, it might now benefit from encouraging the state to comply with Mr. Gardner\u2019s demands and move its caucus back a few days. ||||| Bill Gardner just flipped the Republicans the bird. Again. \n \n In a three-page statement released Wednesday afternoon, the New Hampshire secretary of state reiterated his independence and said he\u2019ll move the primary up as far as necessary to maintain first-in-the-nation status and comply with state law. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset POLITICO 44 \n \n \u201cIf Nevada does not adjust its caucus date to a later time, I cannot rule out the possibility of a December primary,\u201d Gardner wrote. \u201cIf Nevada does not accept a date of Tuesday, January 17th or later for its caucus, it leaves New Hampshire no choice but to consider December of this year. The dates of Tuesday, December 13th and Tuesday, December 6th are realistic options, and we have logistics in place to make either date happen if needed.\u201d \n \n But Gardner didn\u2019t make that point directly to Nevada GOP Chairwoman Amy Tarkanian, who learned of the statement from POLITICO. \n \n She replied, via text message: \u201cWHAT??!!!\u201d \n \n Complete control over setting the nation\u2019s first primary date has made Gardner a quirky fixture of presidential politics for four decades. But with this year\u2019s suddenly upended calendar, Gardner\u2019s disinterested approach is infuriating other early state chairs and the Republican National Committee, who can\u2019t even get him on the phone. \n \n \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense,\u201d said former Ohio GOP chairman Robert Bennett, a member of the RNC\u2019s delegate selection committee. \u201cWhat are you going to do, have a suspension over the holidays of presidential campaigning? Every operative that I\u2019ve talked to said it\u2019s the worst thing that could have happened.\u201d \n \n A lot hinges on Gardner\u2019s decision, which took on new importance after Florida moved its primary to Jan. 31 and South Carolina and Nevada moved up their dates in response. If he schedules the primary in December, ahead of Iowa\u2019s caucus, he could unilaterally alter the the entire nature of the campaign, giving an advantage to Mitt Romney, the former governor of neighboring Massachusetts, who\u2019s remained far ahead in local polls. \n \n But Gardner, who\u2019s so set in his ways that he doesn\u2019t use a cell phone or e-mail, has shown no interest in negotiating. Nor was he involved in the regular conference calls held by those responsible for setting the primary calendar for the other early-nominating states. Tarkanian said that after her party\u2019s initial efforts to speak with Gardner were unsuccessful, she reached out through an intermediary. That person told her Gardner had no plans to set his date until the New Hampshire filing period for candidates to get on the ballot begins Oct. 17. \n \n Ultimately, Nevada last week announced its caucus would be Jan. 14, eliminating Jan. 10 from Gardner\u2019s potential options because New Hampshire law requires the primary be held at least seven days before any \u201csimilar election.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe were hoping to get a specific date out of them but that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Tarkanian said. \u201cWe decided, \u2018This is crazy, we can\u2019t sit around and wait any longer.\u2019\u201d",

    "document": "2 photo s Slideshow \n \n Episcopal Church leaders on Wednesday adopt rituals for same-sex marriage ceremonies, making it the third mainline Protestant denomination in America to do so. \n \n Capping a week of debate in which opposing voices were scarce, the Episcopal Church USA's House of Deputies, meeting in the faith's 78th General Convention, voted 184-23 to approve the new liturgy. In a separate action, Episcopal Church deputies voted 173 to 27 to approve the change to the church's canon, or rules, redefining marriage as being between two persons, instead of a man and a woman. \n \n \"This is one of many bridges we need to build for the future,\" said E. Bruce Garner, a deputy from Atlanta, of the change. But the Rev. Jos\u00e9 Luis Mendoza from Honduras opposed the move, saying it would cause schism in the church. \n \n \"This resolution goes against the biblical principles of our church,\" he said. \"Don't be seduced by the fashion of society.\" \n \n The Episcopal Church vote comes on the heels of a June 26 Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states and a dramatic shift in public support for the change. Episcopalians now join the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the United Church of Christ in offering such rituals to same-sex couples. \n \n The Episcopal Church voted in 1976 that gays and lesbians were \"a full and equal claim with all other persons upon the love, acceptance, and pastoral concern and care of the (c)hurch.\" By 2003, the Episcopal Church elected its first openly gay bishop, a move that critics say triggered a major schism. In the past nine years, the church has lost 12 percent of its membership, statistics revealed. \n \n Beginning Nov. 29, which Episcopalians note as the first Sunday of Advent, congregations will be authorized to use a rite called \"The Witnessing and Blessing of a Lifelong Covenant,\" which is designed without reference to gender. Proposed for \"trial\" use are liturgies tailored to same-sex marriages where they are legal, the church's resolution said. \n \n The use of the liturgies would be subject to the permission of a diocese's bishop, said the Rev. Brian Baker, a member of the church's task force on marriage. Bishops can refuse to allow the ceremonies in their diocese, and any cleric can refuse to marry any couple for any reason, according to the voted resolution. \n \n The church's actions Wednesday also involved changing of official Episcopal Church definition of marriage, contained in a resolution proposing revisions to the church's \"canon,\" or rules, concerning marriage. \n \n According to Joan Geiszler-Ludlum, an attorney from North Carolina and chairwoman of the Committee on Constitution and Canons, those changes would make same-sex couples feel capable of achieving the same goals in marriage other couples desire. \n \n In the runup to the vote, several dozen people spoke at three hearings of the church's special legislative committee on marriage, as well as in the House of Bishops. Only one, the Rt. Rev. William Love, bishop of Albany, New York, cited the Bible in his arguments, referring to Jesus' words on divorce that refer to marriage as between a man and a woman. \n \n Several Episcopal Church delegates said discussions about scriptural interpretations of marriage and same-sex behavior have been ongoing prior to the Salt Lake City convention. \n \n Norah Grimball, a lay deputy from Columbia, South Carolina, said her diocese has \"discussed this at length\" of the study papers citing scripture. \"We have to realize that most of the Bible's references (against homosexuality) were in the setting of abuse and not a committed, loving relationship,\" she said. \n \n The Rt. Rev. Don Johnson, also saying the Bible's viewpoint has been discussed over the years, added, \"we are trying to be faithful to God's love for all creation and our call to be part of that.\" \n \n Responding to the earlier vote by the House of Bishops approving the new marriage liturgy, the leader of the world's Anglicans said the move would add stress to relationships between the Episcopal Church and its Anglican peers. \n \n Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby stated the American move \"will cause distress for some and have ramifications for the Anglican Communion as a whole, as well as for its ecumenical and interfaith relationships.\" \n \n Email: mkellner@deseretnews.com \n \n Twitter: @Mark_Kellner ||||| SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 Episcopalians overwhelmingly voted Wednesday to allow religious weddings for same-sex couples, solidifying the church's embrace of gay rights that began more than a decade ago with the pioneering election of the first openly gay bishop. \n \n FILE - In this May 1, 2005, file photo, Bishop Gene Robinson addresses the congregation at Christ Church in Philadelphia, Sunday, May 1, 2005. Robinson, now retired, said he is breathless about how quickly... (Associated Press) \n \n The vote came in Salt Lake City at the Episcopal General Convention, just days after the U.S. Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide. It passed in the House of Deputies, the voting body of clergy and lay participants at the meeting. The House of Bishops had approved the resolution Tuesday by 129-26 with five abstaining. \n \n The Very Rev. Brian Baker of Sacramento said the church rule change was the result of a nearly four-decade long conversation that has been difficult and painful for many. Baker, chair of the committee that crafted the changes, said church members have not always been kind to one another but that the dynamic has changed in recent decades. \n \n \"We have learned to not only care for, but care about one other,\" Baker said. \"That mutual care was present in the conversations we had. Some people disagreed, some people disagreed deeply, but we prayed and we listened and we came up with compromises that we believe make room and leave no one behind.\" \n \n Baker said the denomination's House of Bishops prayed and debated the issue for five hours earlier this week before passing it on to the House of Deputies. \n \n During debate on Wednesday, several deputies spoke in support of the move, with some saying it was long overdue. Opponents spoke too, including Jose Luis Mendoza-Barahona of Honduras, who gave an impassioned speech in Spanish against the change, saying it goes against the biblical basis of the church and would create a chasm in the church. \n \n The vote eliminates gender-specific language from church laws on marriage so that same-sex couples could have religious weddings. Instead of \"husband\" and \"wife,\" for example, the new church law will refer to \"the couple.\" Under the new rules, clergy can decline to perform the ceremonies. The changes were approved 173-27. The convention also approved a gender-neutral prayer service for marriage on a 184-23 vote. \n \n The measures take effect the first Sunday of Advent, Nov. 29. \n \n Many dioceses in the New York-based church of nearly 1.9 million members have allowed their priests to perform civil same-sex weddings, using a trial prayer service to bless the couple. Still, the church hadn't changed its own laws on marriage until Wednesday. \n \n The Episcopal Church joins two other mainline Protestant groups that allow gay marriage in all their congregations: the United Church of Christ and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). The 3.8-million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America lets its congregations decide for themselves, and many of them host gay weddings. \n \n The United Methodist Church, by far the largest mainline Protestant church with 12.8 million members, bars gay marriage, although many of its clergy have been officiating at same-sex weddings recently in protest. \n \n The Episcopal Church is the U.S. wing of the Anglican Communion, an 80 million-member global fellowship of churches. Ties among Anglicans have been strained since Episcopalians in 2003 elected Bishop Gene Robinson, who lived openly with his male partner, to lead the Diocese of New Hampshire. \n \n On the eve of the U.S. vote, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, spiritual leader of the world's Anglicans, issued a statement expressing deep concern about the move to change the definition of marriage. \n \n Faith groups across the spectrum of belief, from the Episcopal Church to the Southern Baptists, have been losing members as more Americans say they identify with no particular religion. The Episcopal Church has shrunk 18 percent over the last decade, after more than a generation of steady decline. \n \n After the Supreme Court ruling last week, many conservative churches, including the Southern Baptists and the Mormons, renewed their opposition to gay marriage. \n \n The gay marriage decision is the second major news to come from the convention, the top policymaking body of the church. The church elected its first black presiding bishop last weekend, with Bishop Michael Curry of North Carolina winning in a landslide. \n \n Curry has allowed same-sex church weddings in North Carolina, and he said the Supreme Court \"affirmed the authenticity of love\" by legalizing gay marriage. \n \n ___ \n \n McCombs reported from Salt Lake City. AP Religion Writer Rachel Zoll reported from New York. ||||| \n \n Gene Robinson, who in 2003 became the first Episcopal bishop living openly with a same-sex partner, attends the Episcopal General Convention in Salt Lake City on Thursday. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) \n \n This analysis is by George Conger, who has reported on the Anglican/Episcopal world for almost 20 years, writing for newspapers and magazines in England, the United States and Australia. He also serves as an Episcopal priest in a parish in Florida. \n \n The bishops of the Episcopal Church have authorized their clergy to perform same-sex weddings, but don\u2019t expect sweeping changes across the entire denomination anytime soon. Episcopalians voted Wednesday to allow religious weddings for gay couples, but not every priest will necessarily officiate at a same-sex wedding. \n \n In resolutions adopted here at the denomination\u2019s General Convention meeting in Salt Lake City this week, the bishops have endorsed new liturgies or services for same-sex couples wishing to marry in church. The bishops also approved changing the church\u2019s canons, or rules, governing marriage, making them gender neutral by substituting the terms \u201cman and woman\u201d with \u201ccouple.\u201d However, clergy were also given the right to refuse to perform a same-sex marriage, with the promise they would incur no penalty, while bishops were given the right to refuse to allow the services to take place in their diocese. \n \n The compromise means that same-sex weddings may occur after Nov. 1, 2015, with the full blessing of the church in places like Washington, Los Angeles and New York, but likely won\u2019t take place in more conservative parts of the church, like Dallas, Albany and Orlando. \n \n On Tuesday, the leader of the worldwide Anglican Communion that includes the Episcopal Church, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, released a statement expressing his \u201cdeep concern\u201d over the votes and urged the bishops to pull back, writing that the \u201cdecision will cause distress for some and have ramifications for the Anglican Communion as a whole, as well as for its ecumenical and interfaith relationships.\u201d \n \n The church\u2019s compromise has sparked the ire of Episcopalians who are both for and against same-sex marriage. Those who are more theologically liberal may try to block the bishops\u2019 plan, insisting on the immediate introduction of same-sex marriage with no way for dioceses to opt out. On the other hand, those who are conservative are likely to reach out to overseas leaders in the wider Anglican Communion to pressure the church to stop. \n \n The conservative minority of bishops at the meeting agreed the compromise was the best outcome they could hope to achieve, and told their liberal colleagues they were grateful for the accommodation given them. \n \n [Reflecting on outgoing Presiding Bishop Katharine Jefferts Schori\u2019s tenure as Episcopal Church brings in new leader] \n \n The bishops agreed to allow clergy to begin offering same-sex marriages using the new rites after Nov. 1. However, no clergy could be compelled to perform a same-sex marriage, and a bishop had the authority to forbid his clergy from celebrating gay marriages. \n \n The former bishop of Virginia, Peter Lee, explained to the bishops in Salt Lake City the accommodation meant that a conservative priest in a liberal diocese would incur no penalty if he refused to perform a same-sex marriage. The priest would, however, have to pass a couple seeking to be married on to another church or priest to perform the ceremony. \n \n Priests in dioceses where the bishop forbid same-sex marriages may not solemnize gay marriages. A priest who did so would be liable for punishment for disobeying the bishop. A diocese that does not perform gay marriages must pass the couple on to another part of the church that permits gay marriage. \n \n The path toward same-sex blessings and same-sex marriage began at the 2012 meeting of the General Convention in Indianapolis \u2014 the triennial assembly of bishops and deputies from the church\u2019s 109 American and overseas dioceses. The church approved \u201cprovisional\u201d same-sex blessing rites that could be used with the permission of the local bishop. \n \n The default position of the church, however, was that marriage was an exclusive life-long covenant of one man and one woman, as described in the Episcopal Church\u2019s Book of Common Prayer. The provisional rites and trial rites would expand the traditional teaching about marriage, the majority argued, without changing the church\u2019s underlying text or doctrine of marriage. \n \n Where do the battle lines get drawn now? \n \n Bishop Edward S. Little II of northern Indiana opposed the change, telling the convention that the \u201cissue is not the welcome of gays and lesbians\u201d \u2014 all agreed they were to be welcomed, he said \u2014 but \u201cwhether we should alter the received faith of the church?\u201d \n \n Bishop Stephen Bauerschmidt of Tennessee told the convention that \u201cprocreation\u201d was a central tenet of the Christian understanding of marriage. It \u201cmust have the potential to be fruitful in the procreation of a third person,\u201d he argued. \n \n Bishop William Love of Albany rose and addressed the convention and cited the biblical passage Matthew 19:5, where Jesus states that at marriage \u201ca man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\u201d \n \n \u201cIf our Lord is the son of God \u2026 God incarnate. He is quite aware of the nature of marriage and could have offered alternatives but did not,\u201d Love said. The issue before the Episcopal Church was not whether \u201cmen and women can love each other.\u201d The Episcopal Church supported the full civil rights of gays and lesbians, he said. But \u201cGod has told us that is not appropriate to use the gift of sexual intimacy\u201d outside of the marriage of one man and one woman. \n \n What the church should be telling partnered gay and lesbian couples is, \u201cDo you love your partner enough not to engage in sexual intimacy? The issue before us is not about relationships but sexual intimacy,\u201d Love said. \n \n Other bishops disagreed, saying same-gender sexual intimacy was morally acceptable and should be blessed in faithful covenanted relationships. The former bishop of New Hampshire V. Gene Robinson \u2014 the first openly gay Episcopal bishop \u2014 expressed the sentiments of the majority when he told the convention, \u201cI think it is time for us to do this.\u201d \n \n \u201cGays and lesbians are living out their lives in holy ways,\u201d Robinson said. Changing the church\u2019s rules on marriage \u201callows us to recognize this\u201d and to \u201cdeclare how far we have come.\u201d \n \n The Bishop of eastern Michigan, Todd Ousley, also disagreed with some bishops\u2019 emphasis on \u201cprocreation\u201d as a central aim of marriage. The theological studies on marriage undertaken over the past few years had provided a more expansive understanding of \u201cfruitfulness\u201d in marriage, he told the bishops. As the biological father of one and adopted father of two children, Ousley stated that he and his wife \u201chave been fruitful\u201d in their marriage. Procreation\u2019s biological meaning should not drive its theological meaning, he argued. \n \n A spokesman for the church, Bishop Rev. Pierre Whalon, downplayed the archbishop of Canterbury\u2019s concern that the votes would cause distress for the global church body. \u201cThe change of canons does not change anything,\u201d Whalon told The Washington Post, adding that the introduction of trial rites did not detract from the authority of the church\u2019s official stance as stated in the Book of Common Prayer. \n \n What the bishops did agree on was to hold conflicting stances in tension and allow each side to honor their consciences. \n \n (This piece has been updated to clarify the Episcopal Church\u2019s connection to the Anglican Communion.) \n \n Want more religion coverage?

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. \n \n Bananas: Their Origin and Global Rollout The banana is the most popular fruit in the world and ranks among the top ten food commodities for Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America [1]. Notably, the crop is largely produced by small-holder farmers, with around 85% of the global production destined for local markets and only 15% entering international trade [1]. Bananas evolved in the Indo-Malayan archipelago thousands of years ago. The majority of all edible varieties developed from specific (inter- and intra-) hybridizations of two seeded diploid Musa species (M. acuminata and M. balbisiana) and subsequent selection of diploid and triploid seedless clones [2,3]. Despite rich genetic and phenotypic diversity [4], only a few clones developed, over time, into global commodities\u2014either as dessert bananas, such as the triploid \u201cCavendish\u201d clones, or as important staple foods such as cooking bananas and plantains [4,5]. Currently, bananas are widely grown in the (sub)tropics and are consumed in nearly all countries around the world, providing crucial nutrition for millions of people. Edible bananas reproduce asexually through rhizomes, but since the early 1970s, tissue culture has enabled mass production of cultivars [6]. This facilitates the rapid rollout of genetically identical plants, which have consumer-preferred traits and outstanding agronomical performance, onto vast acreages around the world. However, the typical vulnerability of monocultures to diseases has taken its toll on banana production over the last century. In 1876, a wilting disease of banana was reported in Australia [7], and in 1890, it was observed in the \u201cGros Michel\u201d plantation crops of Costa Rica and Panama [8,9]. There it developed major epidemics in the 1900s that are among the worst in agricultural history [10], linking its most prone geographical area to its colloquial name: Panama disease. It was only in 1910 that the soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense (Foc) was identified as the causal agent in Cuba, from which the name of the forma specialis was derived [10]. \n \n Genetic Diversity of Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense, the Causal Agent of Panama Disease Foc belongs to the F. oxysporum species complex: a suite of asexual, morphologically similar, pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains affecting a wide variety of crops [11]. Foc likely co-evolved with its host species Musa in its center of origin [12\u201315]. Traditionally, phenotyping has identified three Foc races (1, 2, and 4) that cause disease in different subsets of banana and plantain cultivars [5,8]. However, Foc race designations are cumbersome and hence other methods unveiling genetic diversity were developed. Vegetative compatibility group (VCG) analyses largely divide Foc into 24 unique VCGs (VCG0120 through VCG0126 and VCG0128 through VCG01224) [5,13,16]. Later, DNA markers revealed the polyphyletic origin of Foc, as some VCGs are taxonomically closer to other F. oxysporum formae speciales than to other Foc VCGs [12,14,17]. Moreover, strains belonging to diverse VCGs infect particular banana cultivars and, hence, were grouped in the same race, suggesting that pathogenicity towards a specific cultivar evolved either convergently [5,12,14] or resulted from horizontal gene transfer among members of the F. oxysporum complex [18]. Overall, Foc lineages show a remarkable dichotomy, referred to as types or clades [12\u201314,19\u201322]. High-resolution genotyping-by-sequencing analyses using DArTseq\u2014which generates short sequence reads after a genome-wide complexity reduction through restriction enzyme digestion [23]\u2014validate and extend these findings (Fig 1). Based on genome-wide DArTseq markers, 24 Foc strains (representing all hitherto known VCGs) split into two groups. These largely corroborate the aforementioned clades, except for VCG0123 [13,14,20,22], VCG01210 [19], VCG01212 [20], and VCG01214 [21], which were occasionally reported in opposite clades, and VCGs 01221 to 01224, which were never classified before but now clearly belong to clade 2 (Fig 1).

Genotyping-by-sequencing analyses of the hitherto identified 24 vegetative compatibility groups (VCG) in F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense resulted in 12,978 DArTseq markers that divide Foc into two distinct clades\u2014clade 1 and clade 2. VCG01216 is considered the same as VCG01213 [13]. The labels for race 1 isolates are based on personal communications with I. Buddenhagen and M. Dita. Although VCG01213 contains all TR4 isolates that cause the current Panama disease epidemic in Cavendish bananas, VCG0120\u2014which has also been considered as race 4 [5]\u2014and VCG0124 [36] have also been recovered from symptomatic Cavendish plants. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005197.g001 Unfortunately, it is not well known which VCGs (the so-called Foc race 1 strains) caused the Panama disease epidemic in \u201cGros Michel\u201d and, hence, their geographical dissemination is still unclear (I. Buddenhagen and M. Dita, personal communications). The current epidemic in Cavendish bananas, however, is caused by VCG01213 [5], colloquially called Tropical Race 4 (TR4). \n \n Panama Disease: History Repeats Itself Large railway projects in Central America in the late 1800s facilitated industrial banana production and trade [10], which was entirely based on \u201cGros Michel\u201d bananas [8]. The unparalleled vulnerability of \u201cGros Michel\u201d to race 1 strains drove aggressive land-claiming policies in order to continue banana production. However, this did not stop the epidemic as Panama disease was easily entering these new areas through infected planting material. Hence, by the 1960s, the epidemic reached a tipping point with the total collapse of \u201cGros Michel\u201d [9]. Fortunately, there was a remedy: Cavendish bananas\u2014maintained as interesting specimens in botanical gardens in the United Kingdom and in the United Fruit Company collection in Honduras\u2014were identified as resistant substitutes for \u201cGros Michel.\u201d A new clone was \u201cborn\u201d that, along with the new tissue culture techniques, helped save and globalize banana production [5,8,9]. However, in the late 1960s, Panama disease emerged in Cavendish bananas in Taiwan, but TR4 was only identified as its cause in 1994 [9,24,25]. Surprisingly, this initial outbreak did not awaken the banana industry and awareness levels remained low, despite the lack of any Cavendish replacement that met market demands and the susceptibility of many local banana cultivars to TR4 [5] (see also http://panamadisease.org/en/news/26). Thus, TR4 threatens not only the export trade but also regional food provision and local economies. \n \n Tropical Race 4, a Single Pathogen Clone, Threatens Global Banana Production Ever since TR4 destroyed the Cavendish-based banana industry in Taiwan, its trail in Southeast Asia seems unstoppable with incursions and expansions in the Chinese provinces of Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi, and Yunnan as well as on the island of Hainan. Since the 1990s, TR4 has also wiped out Cavendish plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia; between 1997 and 1999, it significantly reduced the banana industry near Darwin in the Northern Territory of Australia. It was first observed in the early 2000s in a newly planted Cavendish banana farm in Davao (on island of Mindanao, Philippines), where it currently threatens the entire banana export trade [26]. Since 2013, incursions outside Southeast Asia were reported in Jordan [27], Pakistan, and Lebanon [28], informally announced in Mozambique and Oman, and just recently noted in the Tully region of Northern Queensland, Australia. By now, TR4 may have affected up to approximately 100,000 hectares, and it is likely that it will disseminate further\u2014either through infected plant material, contaminated soil, tools, or footwear, or due to flooding and inappropriate sanitation measures [5,29]. Clearly, the current expansion of the Panama disease epidemic is particularly destructive due to the massive monoculture of susceptible Cavendish bananas. Foc is a haploid asexual pathogen [8] and is therefore expected to have a predominantly clonal population structure [13,14,19\u201322]. Comparison of re-sequencing data of TR4 isolates from Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, and the Philippines\u2014with the publicly available reference genome sequence of Foc TR4 strain II-5 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/)\u2014indeed shows a very low level of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (about 0.01%). This, together with a highly similar set of DArTseq markers, suggests that the temporal and spatial dispersal of TR4 is due to a single clone (Fig 2). This finding underscores the need for global awareness and quarantine campaigns in order to protect banana production from another pandemic that particularly affects vulnerable, small-holder farmers.

Robustness of the grouping was assessed by 500 bootstrap replicates, and thick branches indicate maximum support. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005197.g002 \n \n Strategies for Sustainable Panama Disease Management Any disease management eventually fails in a highly susceptible monoculture. Managing Panama disease with its soil-borne nature, long latency period, and persistence once established is, therefore, impossible without drastic strategy changes. Evidently, exclusion is the primary measure to protect banana production, which requires accurate diagnosis based not only on visual inspection, as this overlooks important aspects of its genetic diversity and epidemiology. New molecular-based diagnostics rapidly detect TR4 in (pre)symptomatic plants [30], soil, and water and, hence, can be used for surveillance and containment, which are key to avoiding an encounter of TR4 with Cavendish monocultures. Additionally, a thorough understanding of Foc epidemiology and pathology is urgently required, as this facilitates developing effective methods to destroy infected plants and (biological) soil treatments, thus reducing the inoculum quantity. Furthermore, we showed that high-throughput genome analyses unveil Foc population diversity (Figs 1 and 2), rather than lengthy and cumbersome VCG analyses, which enables resistance deployment strategies. Finally, effective disease management cannot be achieved without adequate disease resistance levels. \u201cCavendish\u201d-based somaclones [31] do not satisfy local or international industry demands (apart from the epidemiological risks), as this germplasm is, at most, only partially resistant to TR4 [32]. Instead, the substantial genetic diversity for TR4 resistance in (wild) banana germplasm, such as accessions of Musa acuminata ssp. malaccensis [4], can be exploited in breeding programs and/or along with various transformation techniques [33\u201335] to develop a new generation of banana cultivars in conformity with consumer preferences. Developing new banana cultivars, however, requires major investments in research and development and the recognition of the banana as a global staple and cash crop (rather than an orphan crop) that supports the livelihoods of millions of small-holder farmers. Until new, commercially viable, and resistant banana cultivars reach markets, any potential disease management option needs to be scrutinized, thereby lengthening the commercial lifespan of contemporary banana accessions. The current TR4 epidemic and inherent global attention should be the wake-up call for these much needed strategy changes. \n \n Supporting Information S1 Table. Isolate collection at Wageningen University and Research Center used in this study. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005197.s001 (XLSX) ||||| Scientists at Wageningen University have demonstrated that the same clone of the Fusarium fungus is infecting Cavendish bananas in several countries dotted across the globe. This shows that this Fusarium clone, also known as Tropical Race 4, is continuing to spread despite the quarantine measures, with disastrous results for banana growers. The results from the research appeared today in the scientific journal PLOS Pathogens. \n \n Panama disease is caused by the Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense fungus. One of the Fusarium strains is called 'Tropical Race 4' (TR4) and infects many local banana varieties as well as the widely exported Cavendish banana, which is very susceptible to this strain. The soil-borne fungus enters the banana plant through the root and eventually kills the entire plant. Banana-growing plots infested with the fungus remain contaminated for many years. It is then no longer possible to cultivate bananas on such a plot of land, as new banana plants become infected too. Large areas of banana plantations in countries such as Jordan, Mozambique, China, the Philippines, Pakistan and Australia are no longer suitable for banana farming, as they have become infested with the Panama disease fungus. There are currently no means of combating the disease; only quarantine measures can prevent banana plantations from becoming infested. \n \n DNA investigation \n \n The researchers at Wageningen UR analysed the DNA of many fungus specimens from eight countries where the fungus has recently been identified, including Jordan, Lebanon and Pakistan, in order to trace how Panama disease has come to spread to different locations across the globe. The research highlighted that the strains of the fungus, which were collected are genetically identical. The strains are clones. Gert Kema, banana expert at Wageningen UR, says: 'This research demonstrates that the quarantine measures and information provided around the globe apparently have not had the desired effect.' \n \n A tale of two clones \n \n Not only the TR4 fungus strain is a clone: all Cavendish bananas also share the same genes. Kema explains: 'The Cavendish banana is very susceptible to TR4. Therefore, the fungus can spread easily due to the worldwide monoculture of Cavendish bananas. That's why we have to intensify awareness campaigns to reach small and large-scale growers in order to help them with developing and implementing quarantine measures preventing the fungus from continued spreading.' \n \n The video will load shortly \n \n Worldwide approach needed to stop further spreading \n \n To stop further spreading, Kema's team is working with a large number of partners in different locations across the globe to develop short-term solutions for Panama disease management. Kema continues: 'We are gaining more and more insight into the scope of the issue. The ability to quickly identify infected banana plants and infested soils is extremely important in this respect. However, eventually we have to come up with long-term solutions, particularly host resistance, which can only be developed in strong multidisciplinary alliances with various partners and industry.' \n \n The video will load shortly \n \n Explore further: Panama disease detected in banana plantations in Pakistan and Lebanon \n \n More information: Nadia Ordonez et al.

The so-called \"Panama\" disease is spreading thanks to a single clone of the Fusarium fungus, also called Tropical Race 4, scientists report in the journal PLOS Pathogens. Worse still, one of the world's most popular bananas, the Cavendish, is particularly susceptible to this strain. The soil-borne fungus travels up the plant's roots, ultimately killing the plant and infesting entire banana plots, which are then contaminated for years. Entire swaths of banana plantations in Australia, China, the Philippines, Jordan, Mozambique, Pakistan, and beyond have been infested in the past two years, putting many farmers and families out of business and cutting them off from a major food source, reports PhysOrg. Right now the only way to fight the disease is through strict quarantine, so researchers are trying to spread the word about effective measures in the hopes of getting a step ahead of the fast-spreading fungus before it hits Latin America, where most of the world's bananas are grown. Once it lands there, notes Quartz, \"the days of the iconic yellow fruit are numbered.\" (Some researchers hope it's possible to genetically modify bananas to resist the fungus.)",

It turns out that the virus has been making its way across the Middle East and North Africa, infecting banana plants in Lebanon and Pakistan, and infecting the crops of people in other countries as well. The researchers say the root of the problem is what's known as the \"cannibal virus,\" which has been around for centuries and has been linked to a wide range of maladies, including brain damage, blindness, and even death. But it's the genetic component of the virus that's causing so much trouble. As the researchers explain in their study, the virus causes an increase in the number of parasitic worms that enter the banana plants and spread to other crops and animals. That's why it's so important for growers to stop the virus before it takes hold and start using quarantine measures. And it's a problem that's only going to get worse as more and more people learn about the virus and its devastating effect on the banana industry. \"We need to do everything we can to stop it,\" says Nadia Ordonez, the lead researcher of the study. \"It's a game changer.\"",

    "document": "CLOSE Pete Seeger will be remembered as a folk music legend. The 94-year-old was known for penning \"Turn, Turn Turn\" and popularizing \"This Land is Your Land\", but there are lots of other fascinating facts many may not know about Seeger. VPC \n \n Seeger popularized \"This Land Is Your Land\" and \"We Shall Overcome\" and wrote \"If I Had a Hammer\" and \"Turn, Turn, Turn.\" He opposed McCarthyism, marched beside MLK and led environmental campaigns. \n \n Pete Seeger performs in 2008 in a scene from the motion picture \"Pete Seeger: The Power of Song.\" (Photo: Genius Products/The Weinstein Company) Story Highlights He adapted and popularized 'We Shall Overcome' \n \n Continued to perform into his 90s. \n \n Was once a member of the Communist Party. \n \n To Bruce Springsteen, Pete Seeger, the singer/songwriter/activist who died Monday at the age of 94, was \"the father of American folk music.\" \n \n But Seeger, who popularized This Land Is Your Land and We Shall Overcome and wrote If I Had a Hammer and Turn, Turn, Turn, never liked the term folk music. \n \n \"It's been defined as the 'music of the peasants,' \" Seeger told USA TODAY in a 2009 interview, \"and then you get someone saying (of Seeger), 'he's no peasant!''' \n \n Seeger, who dropped out of Harvard University in 1938 to ride a bicycle across the country, quoted his father, Charles Seeger, a musicologist: \"My dad, the old professor, used to say, 'Never get into an argument about what's folk music and what isn't.' \" \n \n But whatever you called him, Seeger influenced scores of other singers, including Springsteen, Joan Baez, Dave Matthews, Rufus Wainwright, John Mellencamp and Arlo Guthrie. All performed in 2009 at Seeger's 90th birthday party at sold-out Madison Square Garden, a fundraiser for his favorite local cause: cleaning up New York's Hudson River. \n \n RELATED: Recommended listening: Pete Seeger \n \n That night, Springsteen introduced Seeger saying, \"He's gonna look a lot like your granddad that wears flannel shirts and funny hats. He's gonna look like your granddad if your granddad can kick your ass. At 90, he remains a stealth dagger through the heart of our country's illusions about itself.\" \n \n PHOTOS: A look at the life of Pete Seeger \n \n Tao Rodriguez-Seeger and Pete Seeger perform \"This Land Is Your Land\" at the Clearwater Concert: Creating the Next Generation of Environmental Leaders at Madison Square Garden on May 3, 2009. The concert honored Seeger on his 90th birthday. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY) \n \n On his facebook page Tuesday, Arlo Guthrie, who performed often with Seeger and is the son of Woody Guthrie (who taught Seeger how to jump freight trains), described his last phone call to Seeger's hospital bed Monday night. \n \n \"I simply wanted him to know that I loved him dearly, like a father in some ways, a mentor in others and just as a dear friend a lot of the time,\" Guthrie wrote. \n \n \"I let him know I was having trouble writing his obituary - as I'd been asked -- but it seemed just so silly and I couldn't think of anything that didn't sound trite or plain stupid....We laughed, we talked, and I took my leave about 9:30.\" \n \n \"'Arlo,'\" Seeger said, \"sounding just like the man I've known all of my life, 'I guess I'll see ya later.' I've always loved the rising and falling inflections in his voice. \n \n \" 'Pete,' I said. \"I guess we will.\" \n \n Guthrie fell asleep until about 3 a.m. when texts and phone calls began from friends saying, \"Pete had passed away.\" \n \n \"Well, of course he passed away,\" Guthrie said in response. \"But that doesn't mean he's gone.\" \n \n Seeger opposed McCarthyism, marched beside the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and led environmental campaigns. In 1969, he helped build a 10-foot sailing sloop called the Clearwater that continues to serve as a \"floating classroom\" and rallying point for cleaning up the Hudson. \n \n \"Songs won't save the planet,\" Seeger told his biographer David Dunaway, author of How Can I Keep From Singing? \"But, then, neither will books or speeches. ... Songs are sneaky things. They can slip across borders. Proliferate in prisons.\" He liked to quote Plato: \"Rulers should be careful about what songs are allowed to be sung.\" \n \n Seeger is the only singer in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame who was convicted of contempt of Congress. In 1955, he refused to testify about his past membership in the Communist Party. (He later said he quit the party in 1949 and \"should have left much earlier. It was stupid of me not to. ... I thought Stalin was the brave secretary Stalin and had no idea how cruel a leader he was.\") \n \n In 1961, his conviction was overturned on appeal, but Seeger continued to be blacklisted by commercial TV networks until 1967. Even then, CBS censored parts of his anti-Vietnam War musical allegory, Waist Deep in the Big Muddy, when he sang it on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. \n \n CLOSE Pete Seeger - from a May 2009 interview with The Poughkeepsie (N.Y.) Journal The Poughkeepsie (N.Y.) Journal \n \n In 2006, Springsteen helped introduce Seeger to a new generation when he recorded We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, an album of 13 songs popularized by Seeger, including John Henry and Shenandoah. Three years later, Springsteen persuaded Seeger to sing This Land Is Your Land with him at President Obama's inaugural concert in frigid temperatures on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. \n \n \"He was so happy that day,\" Springsteen said later. \"It was like, 'Pete, you outlasted the bastards, man.' It was so nice.\" \n \n Much earlier, poet Carl Sandberg crowned Seeger \"America's tuning fork.\" But when Bob Dylan called Seeger a saint, that was going too far. \n \n \"What a terrible thing to call someone,\" Seeger told USA TODAY on the eve of his 90th birthday. \"I've made a lot of foolish mistakes over the years.\" \n \n TIMELINE: Pete Seeger 1919 - 2014 \n \n But no one was better at leading sing-alongs. \"There is no such thing as a wrong note,\" he liked to say when leading group renditions of songs like Amazing Grace, \"just as long as you're singing along.\" \n \n At the end of our interview in 2009, I mentioned that my father had attended one of Seeger's free outdoor concerts decades earlier. As my father told it, Seeger noticed my dad wasn't singing and urged him to join in. My father said he shot back, \"It's a free country. If I don't want to sing, I don't have to.\" \n \n When I told Seeger that story, he asked if my father was still alive. No, I said. \n \n \"That's too bad,\" Seeger replied, \"because I have some new songs he might like.\" \n \n Seeger was born in New York on May 3, 1919, to musical parents: His father was a Harvard-trained composer. His mother, Constance, was a concert violinist. \n \n After dropping out of Harvard, Seeger met Woody Guthrie. They became part of the left-wing Almanac Singers who sang in opposition to the peacetime draft of 1940. But after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Seeger enlisted in the Army and trained as an airplane mechanic. He ended up being assigned to entertain the troops in the Pacific. When he was asked what he did in the war, he'd answer: \"I strummed my banjo.\" \n \n Seeger co-founded the Weavers, who had an apolitical hit, Good Night Irene, which topped the charts for 13 weeks in 1950, but within three years they were blacklisted from radio and TV because of their left-wing politics. \n \n Long after the blacklists ended, Seeger continued protesting. In 2011, he joined a march in support of the Occupy Wall Street protests. \n \n MORE : Seeger's impact on labor movement \n \n For more than 60 years, he lived in Beacon, N.Y., with his wife, Toshi, in a cabin he mostly built himself on a cliff overlooking the Hudson River, 60 miles north of Manhattan. Toshi, whom he called \"the brains of the family,\" died at 91 in 2013, after nearly 70 years of marriage. Seeger is suvived by a son, Daniel; two daughters, Mika Seeger and Tinya Seeger; six grandchildren; and a great-grandson. \n \n If he didn't being want to be called a folk singer, what term did he prefer? \n \n \"How about river singer,\" he suggested. \"I sing up and down the Hudson River.\" \n \n The last time I saw Seeger perform was in 2010 at an environmental fundraiser in an old church in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y. He looked as pleased to be singing with a local children's chorus, with kids named Destiny Burroughs and Maddy Murphy, as he had at Madison Square Garden with Springsteen, Baez and Mellencamp. \n \n &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;!--iframe--&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1euexrH ||||| A Generation\u2019s Mentor \n \n Mr. Seeger was a mentor to younger folk and topical singers in the \u201850s and \u201860s, among them Bob Dylan, Don McLean and Bernice Johnson Reagon, who founded Sweet Honey in the Rock. Decades later, Bruce Springsteen drew from Mr. Seeger\u2019s repertory of traditional music about a turbulent America in recording his 2006 album, \u201cWe Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions,\u201d and in 2009 he performed Woody Guthrie\u2019s \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d with Mr. Seeger at the Obama inaugural. At a Madison Square Garden concert celebrating Mr. Seeger\u2019s 90th birthday, Mr. Springsteen introduced him as \u201ca living archive of America\u2019s music and conscience, a testament of the power of song and culture to nudge history along.\u201d \n \n Although he recorded dozens of albums, Mr. Seeger distrusted commercialism and was never comfortable with the idea of stardom. He invariably tried to use his celebrity to bring attention and contributions to the causes that moved him, or to the traditional songs he wanted to preserve. \n \n Mr. Seeger saw himself as part of a continuing folk tradition, constantly recycling and revising music that had been honed by time. \n \n During the McCarthy era Mr. Seeger\u2019s political affiliations, including membership in the Communist Party in the 1940s, led to his being blacklisted and later indicted for contempt of Congress. The pressure broke up the Weavers, and Mr. Seeger disappeared from commercial television until the late 1960s. But he never stopped recording, performing and listening to songs from ordinary people. Through the decades, his songs have become part of America\u2019s folklore. \n \n \u201cMy job,\u201d he said in 2009, \u201cis to show folks there\u2019s a lot of good music in this world, and if used right it may help to save the planet.\u201d \n \n Peter Seeger was born in Manhattan on May 3, 1919, to Charles Seeger, a musicologist, and Constance de Clyver Edson Seeger, a concert violinist. His parents later divorced. \n \n Video \n \n He began playing the ukulele while attending Avon Old Farms, a private boarding school in Connecticut. His father and his stepmother, the composer Ruth Crawford Seeger, collected and transcribed rural American folk music, as did folklorists like John and Alan Lomax. He heard the five-string banjo, which would become his main instrument, when his father took him to a square-dance festival in North Carolina. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Young Pete became enthralled by rural traditions. \u201cI liked the strident vocal tone of the singers, the vigorous dancing,\u201d he is quoted as saying in \u201cHow Can I Keep From Singing,\u201d a biography by David Dunaway. \u201cThe words of the songs had all the meat of life in them. Their humor had a bite, it was not trivial. Their tragedy was real, not sentimental.\u201d \n \n Planning to be a journalist, Mr. Seeger attended Harvard, where he founded a radical newspaper and joined the Young Communist League. After two years he dropped out and went to New York City, where Alan Lomax introduced him to the blues singer Huddie Ledbetter, known as Lead Belly. Lomax also helped Mr. Seeger find a job cataloging and transcribing music at the Archive of American Folk Song at the Library of Congress. \n \n Mr. Seeger met Guthrie, a songwriter who shared his love of vernacular music and agitprop ambitions, in 1940, when they performed at a benefit concert for migrant California workers. Traveling across the United States with Guthrie, Mr. Seeger picked up some of his style and repertory. He also hitchhiked and hopped freight trains by himself, learning and trading songs. \n \n When he returned to New York later in 1940, Mr. Seeger made his first albums. He, Millard Lampell and Hays founded the Almanac Singers, who performed union songs and, until Germany invaded the Soviet Union, antiwar songs, following the Communist Party line. Guthrie soon joined the group. \n \n During World War II the Almanac Singers\u2019 repertory turned to patriotic, anti-fascist songs, bringing them a broad audience, including a prime-time national radio spot. But the singers\u2019 earlier antiwar songs, the target of an F.B.I. investigation, came to light, and the group\u2019s career plummeted. \n \n Before the group completely dissolved, however, Mr. Seeger was drafted in 1942 and assigned to a unit of performers. He married Toshi-Aline Ohta while on furlough in 1943. She would become essential to his work: he called her \u201cthe brains of the family.\u201d \n \n When he returned from the war he founded People\u2019s Songs Inc., which published political songs and presented concerts for several years before going bankrupt. He also started his nightclub career, performing at the Village Vanguard in Greenwich Village. Mr. Seeger and Paul Robeson toured with the campaign of Henry Wallace, the Progressive Party presidential candidate, in 1948. \n \n Forming the Weavers \n \n Mr. Seeger invested $1,700 in 17 acres of land overlooking the Hudson River in Beacon, N.Y., and began building a log cabin there in the late 1940s. (He lived in Beacon for the rest of his life.) In 1949, Mr. Seeger, Hays, Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman started working together as the Weavers. They were signed to Decca Records by Gordon Jenkins, who was the company\u2019s music director and an arranger for Frank Sinatra. With Jenkins\u2019s elaborate orchestral arrangements, the group recorded a repertoire that stretched from \u201cIf I Had a Hammer\u201d and a South African song, \u201cWimoweh\u201d (the title was Mr. Seeger\u2019s mishearing of \u201cMbube,\u201d the name of a South African hit by Solomon Linda), to an Israeli soldiers\u2019 song, \u201cTzena, Tzena, Tzena,\u201d and a cleaned-up version of Lead Belly\u2019s \u201cGoodnight, Irene.\u201d Onstage, they also sang more pointed topical songs. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In 1950 and 1951 the Weavers were national stars, with hit singles and engagements at major nightclubs. Their hits included \u201cKisses Sweeter Than Wine\u201d and Guthrie\u2019s \u201cSo Long (It\u2019s Been Good to Know Yuh),\u201d and they sold an estimated four million singles and albums. \n \n Their commercial success was dampened, however, when \u201cRed Channels,\u201d an influential pamphlet that named performers with suspected Communist ties, appeared in June 1950 and listed Mr. Seeger, although by then he had quit the Communist Party. He later criticized himself for not having left the party sooner, though he continued to describe himself as a \u201ccommunist with a small \u2018c.' \u201d \n \n Photo \n \n By the summer of 1951, the \u201cRed Channels\u201d citation and leaks from F.B.I. files had led to the cancellation of television appearances. In 1951, the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee investigated the Weavers for sedition. And in February 1952, a former member of People\u2019s Songs testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee that three of the four Weavers were members of the Communist Party. \n \n As engagements dried up, the Weavers disbanded, though they reunited occasionally in the mid-1950s. After the group recorded an advertisement for Lucky Strike cigarettes, Mr. Seeger left, citing his objection to promoting tobacco use. \n \n Shut out of national exposure, Mr. Seeger returned primarily to solo concerts, touring college coffeehouses, churches, schools and summer camps, building an audience for folk music among young people. He started to write a long-running column for the folk-song magazine Sing Out! And he recorded prolifically for the independent Folkways label, singing everything from children\u2019s songs to Spanish Civil War anthems. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In his testimony he said, \u201cI feel that in my whole life I have never done anything of any conspiratorial nature.\u201d He also stated: \u201cI am not going to answer any questions as to my association, my philosophical or religious beliefs or my political beliefs, or how I voted in any election, or any of these private affairs. I think these are very improper questions for any American to be asked, especially under such compulsion as this.\u201d \n \n Mr. Seeger offered to sing the songs mentioned by the congressmen who questioned him. The committee declined. \n \n Mr. Seeger was indicted in 1957 on 10 counts of contempt of Congress. He was convicted in 1961 and sentenced to a year in prison, but the next year an appeals court dismissed the indictment as faulty. After the indictment, Mr. Seeger\u2019s concerts were often picketed by the John Birch Society and other rightist groups. \u201cAll those protests did was sell tickets and get me free publicity,\u201d he later said. \u201cThe more they protested, the bigger the audiences became.\u201d \n \n The Folk Revival Years \n \n By then the folk revival was prospering. In 1959, Mr. Seeger was among the founders of the Newport Folk Festival. The Kingston Trio\u2019s version of Mr. Seeger\u2019s \u201cWhere Have All the Flowers Gone?\u201d reached the Top 40 in 1962, soon followed by Peter, Paul and Mary\u2019s version of \u201cIf I Had a Hammer,\u201d which rose to the Top 10. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Seeger was signed to a major label, Columbia Records, in 1961, but he remained unwelcome on network television. \u201cHootenanny,\u201d an early-1960s show on ABC that capitalized on the folk revival, refused to book Mr. Seeger, causing other performers (including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Peter, Paul and Mary) to boycott it. \u201cHootenanny\u201d eventually offered to present Mr. Seeger if he would sign a loyalty oath. He refused. \n \n He toured the world, performing and collecting folk songs, in 1963 and returned to serenade civil rights advocates, who had made a rallying song of his \u201cWe Shall Overcome.\u201d \n \n Like many of Mr. Seeger\u2019s songs, \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d had convoluted traditional roots. It was based on old gospel songs, primarily \u201cI\u2019ll Overcome,\u201d a hymn that striking tobacco workers had sung on a picket line in South Carolina. A slower version, \u201cWe Will Overcome,\u201d was collected from Lucille Simmons, one of the workers, by Zilphia Horton, the musical director of the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tenn., which trained union organizers. \n \n Ms. Horton taught it to Mr. Seeger, and her version of \u201cWe Will Overcome\u201d was published in the People\u2019s Songs newsletter. Mr. Seeger changed \u201cWe will\u201d to \u201cWe shall\u201d and added verses (\u201cWe\u2019ll walk hand in hand\u201d). He taught it to the singers Frank Hamilton, who would join the Weavers in 1962, and Guy Carawan, who became musical director at Highlander in the \u201850s. Mr. Carawan taught the song to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee at its founding convention. \n \n Photo \n \n The song was copyrighted by Mr. Seeger, Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Carawan and Ms. Horton. \u201cAt that time we didn\u2019t know Lucille Simmons\u2019s name,\u201d Mr. Seeger wrote in an autobiographical songbook, \u201cWhere Have All the Flowers Gone,\u201d pubished in 1993. All of the song\u2019s royalties go to the \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d Fund, administered by what is now the Highlander Research and Education Center, which provides grants to African-Americans organizing in the South. \n \n Along with many elders of the protest-song movement, Mr. Seeger felt betrayed when Bob Dylan set aside protest songs for electric rock. When Mr. Dylan appeared at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival with a loud electric blues band, some listeners booed, and reports emerged that Mr. Seeger had tried to cut the power cable with an ax. But witnesses, including the festival\u2019s producer, George Wein, and production manager, Joe Boyd (later a leading folk-rock record producer), said he did not go that far. (An ax was available, however. A group of prisoners had used it while singing a logging song.) \n \n In later recountings, Mr. Seeger said he had grown angry because the music was so loud and distorted that he couldn\u2019t hear the words. \n \n As the United States grew divided over the Vietnam War, Mr. Seeger wrote \u201cWaist Deep in the Big Muddy,\u201d an antiwar song with the refrain \u201cThe big fool says to push on.\u201d He performed the song during a taping of \u201cThe Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\u201d in September 1967, his return to network television, but it was cut before the show was broadcast. After the Smothers Brothers publicized the censorship, Mr. Seeger returned to perform the song for broadcast in February 1968. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Fighting for the Hudson River \n \n During the late 1960s Mr. Seeger started an improbable project: a sailing ship that would crusade for cleaner water on the Hudson River. Between other benefit concerts he raised money to build the Clearwater, a 106-foot sloop, which was launched in June 1969 with a crew of musicians. The ship became a symbol and a rallying point for antipollution efforts and education. \n \n In May 2009, after decades of litigation and environmental activism led by Mr. Seeger\u2019s nonprofit environmental organization, Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, General Electric began dredging sediment containing PCBs it had dumped into the Hudson. Mr. Seeger and his wife also helped organize a yearly summer folk festival named after the Clearwater. \n \n In the 1980s and \u201890s Mr. Seeger toured regularly with Arlo Guthrie, Woody\u2019s son, and continued to lead singalongs and perform benefit concerts. Recognition and awards arrived. He was elected to the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1972, and in 1993 he was given a lifetime achievement Grammy Award.

Because when women succeed, America succeeds,\u201d Obama said in a speech to mark the signing of the order. \n \n \u201cWe are going to work to make sure that our daughters have the same chance to pursue their dreams as our sons,\u201d he added, urging businesses and the government to do more to hire women and achieve gender equality in a bid to lift families out of poverty and allocate more resources to child care, college tuition and retirement savings. \n \n \u201cWe don\u2019t have second-class citizens in this country,\u201d Obama said. \n \n Tuesday\u2019s signing coincides with National Equal Pay Day, serving as a reminder that more than 50 years after the Equal Pay Act was made law, women still earn less then men. On average, women earn only about 77 cents on the dollar compared with men. African-American women and Latinas take home even less, just 64 cents and 54 cents, respectively, for every dollar earned by white men, according to the National Women\u2019s Law Center (NWLC). Obama called the numbers \u201cembarrassing,\u201d and \u201cwrong.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt is good to move the ball forward on improving our equal pay policies,\u201d Fatima Graves, NWLC vice president for education and employment, told Al Jazeera. \u201cIt\u2019s important because right now workers are left in the dark about wage disparity information.\u201d \n \n \u201cPenalizing pay secrecy is an important step that sends a strong message,\u201d she said. But, Graves added, Obama\u2019s order, which affects only federal contractors and does nothing to protect female employees in the private sector, \u201cdoesn\u2019t complete the job.\u201d \n \n \u201cWhat we really need is for Congress to pass the Fair Paycheck Act which would get at all workers,\u201d she said. \n \n A Senate vote on that act, slated for Tuesday, would extend the order\u2019s requirements to most other employers. However, the bill has already failed to pass twice, despite evidence that pay transparency can reduce the gender wage gap. In the federal government, for example, where pay rates are publicly available, the gender wage gap is much smaller than in the private sector, according to the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research. ||||| President Obama will take two executive actions Tuesday aimed at narrowing the wage gap between men and women, forcing federal contractors to let their workers discuss their earnings with one another and to disclose more information about what their employees earn. \n \n The push by Obama, who also is commemorating Tuesday as \u201cNational Equal Pay Day,\u201d is part of a broader effort by Democrats to increase turnout among female voters during the 2014 midterm elections, which party strategists consider critical to limiting Republican gains this fall. \n \n One of the new measures is an executive order prohibiting federal contractors from retaliating against workers who discuss their salaries with one another. The other is a presidential memorandum ordering new rules for contractors to file data with the federal government showing how they compensate employees, including by sex and race. \n \n White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett said Monday that the two policies aim to address the \u201cpay secrecy\u201d that often keeps workers from seeking more equitable compensation. \n \n \u201cUnfortunately, pay inequity is a real and persistent problem that continues to shortchange women, their families and our economy as a whole,\u201d she told reporters in a conference call. \n \n Senate Democrats are hoping paycheck policy will be a smart play by focusing attention on the fight for equal pay. However, opponents say it's less about the wage gap and more about politics. (Pamela Kirkland/The Washington Post) \n \n The first bill that Obama signed into law in 2009 was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which gave employees more time to file discrimination claims. Jarrett said the administration is disappointed that Republicans in Congress have opposed another bill, the Paycheck Fairness Act, which includes reforms like the ones that Obama is applying to federal contractors. \n \n But Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, wrote in an e-mail that the Paycheck Fairness Act is \u201ca desperate political ploy and Democrats are cynically betting that Americans aren\u2019t smart enough to know better.\u201d \n \n Kukowski said the proposal \u201ccuts flexibility in the workplace for working moms and ends merit pay that rewards good work \u2014 the very things that are important to us.\u201d \n \n Obama and his aides often say that women earn 77 cents for every dollar men earn, which compares the annual earnings of women working full-time jobs over the course of a year with the earnings of men working the same amount of time. Some academics argue that the gap between the sexes is smaller if you account for a number of variables, including an employee\u2019s length of time in the workforce, specific occupation and education level. \n \n Even the most conservative estimates, however, suggest that women earn 5 to 12 percent less for doing similar jobs as men. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better figure,\u201d said Betsey Stevenson, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, who also spoke to reporters on the conference call with Jarrett. \u201cWhat we do know is there are more things we can do to close that gap.\u201d \n \n Fatima Goss Graves, vice president for education and employment at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, said in an interview that the new requirements could spur companies to take voluntary measures to equalize salaries. \n \n View Graphic Women in the United States earn about 81 cents for every dollar that a man earns. \n \n \u201cOne of the problems in the law is pay discrimination goes undetected,\u201d she said, \u201cThis is going to put employers in a place where they\u2019re going to take the right steps, and look for pay disparities and correct them immediately.\u201d \n \n One of the reasons women continue to earn less than men on average is that they work in lower-paying fields, Goss Graves said. Roughly two-thirds of all workers who were paid minimum wage or less in 2013 were female, she added. \n \n \u201cA big part of the wage gap stems from the fact that women-dominated jobs simply pay less,\u201d she said. \n \n The White House itself is not immune to inequalities: An analysis by the conservative American Enterprise Institute found that the median salary for female White House staffers was 12 percent lower than that for male staffers. \n \n White House press secretary Jay Carney said Monday that the number \u201cis better than the national average\u201d and said women who work the same jobs as men at the White House are paid the same. He said the two deputy chiefs of staff at the White House \u2014 one man and one woman \u2014 earn the same salary, while more than half of 16 department heads are women. \n \n \u201cWhat I can tell you is that we have as an institution here have aggressively addressed this challenge,\u201d he said. \n \n Mark Perry, an economics professor at the University of Michigan at Flint who wrote the AEI study, said the wage gap might reflect women and men having different roles within the White House, rather than discrimination. \n \n A senior administration official said the White House makes it a priority to hire women and diverse talent at all levels. \n \n \u201cWhile we still have work to do, we believe that our focus on hiring more young talent, especially women, to work in the White House is the right thing to do to build a strong and diverse staff that can advance in this and future administrations,\u201d said the official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss personnel matters. \n \n \u201cWe have also made an effort to advance women through the ranks within the White House, as shown by the number of women in senior positions whom have been promoted from within,\u201d the official said.",

Local officials, emergency services, and the public were not notified of the lane closures, which Fort Lee declared a threat to public safety.[6] The resulting back-ups and gridlock on local streets ended only when the two lanes were reopened on Friday, September 13, 2013, by an order from Port Authority Executive Director Patrick Foye. He said that the \"hasty and ill-informed decision\" could have endangered lives and violated federal and state laws.[7] \n \n It was later suggested that the lanes had been closed to intentionally cause the massive traffic problem for political reasons, and especially theorized that they were a retribution attack against Fort Lee's Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat who had not supported Christie as a candidate in the 2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election. The ensuing investigations centered on several of Christie's appointees and staff, including[8] David Wildstein, who ordered the lanes closed,[10] and Bill Baroni, who had told the New Jersey Assembly Transportation Committee that the closures were for a traffic study.[11] \n \n The United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey Paul J. Fishman launched a massive federal investigation,[12] resulting in a sweeping nine-count indictment against Bridget Anne Kelly, the deputy chief of staff, Baroni and Wildstein.[13] Wildstein entered a guilty plea, and testified against Baroni and Kelly, who were found guilty on all counts in November 2016.[14] David Samson pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy in July 2016, for acts unrelated to the lane closures but unearthed by the federal Bridgegate investigation.[15] \n \n Governor Chris Christie's political standing was badly damaged by the scandal.[16][17][18][19][20] Once considered a leading contender for the 2016 Republican nomination for President, Christie dropped out of the presidential race after a poor showing in the New Hampshire primary. The scandal was widely cited as a major factor in the early demise of Christie's 2016 presidential ambitions.[21][22][23][24][25] Christie called Bridgegate \"a factor\" in why he was bypassed by Donald Trump as the vice presidential nominee.[26][27] In September 2016, both the prosecution and the defense in the trial of two of Christie's former aides argued that Christie knew of his close associates' involvement in a plan to shut down lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge as it was happening, and that the closings were to punish Sokolich for declining to support Christie's reelection bid.[28] This was the first time Christie had been officially accused of contemporaneous knowledge of the plot.[29] \n \n Background [ edit ] \n \n \"Bridgegate\" entrance, customary three rush-hour toll lanes (20, 22, 24) \n \n The George Washington Bridge, a double-decked toll bridge, is the busiest motor-vehicle bridge in the world,[30][31] with a toll charge for traffic from New Jersey to New York.[32] At the time, there were 29 operating toll lanes,[33] spread among three toll plazas.[34][35][36] At the main toll plaza for the upper level, there were twelve toll lanes and a Fort Lee entrance at Martha Washington Way (also called Park Avenue).[3] During rush hours, for the previous 30 years or longer,[37](p86) the three lanes located furthest to the right (the south end of the toll plaza) were ordinarily reserved for local traffic entering from Fort Lee and the surrounding communities.[4] This local traffic was segregated by movable traffic cones from the heavier traffic of the major highways.[38] There were other Fort Lee street entrances, which did not have dedicated toll lanes, to the lower and upper levels of the bridge. \n \n The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (PANYNJ or simply the PA), the owner of the bridge, was overseen by a Board of Commissioners. Under an informal power-sharing agreement, the Governor of New Jersey chose the chairman of the board and the deputy executive director, while the Governor of New York chose the vice-chairman and executive director.[39][40] \n \n Chris Christie, a Republican, was first elected Governor of New Jersey in November 2009 and re-elected in November 2013. During his first term, he appointed Bill Baroni as deputy executive director of the PA.[41] David Wildstein, a local politician and political blogger who had known Christie during high school, was hired by Baroni based on Christie's referral and recommendation in May 2010.[42][43] As director of interstate capital projects, Wildstein was New Jersey's second highest executive at the Port Authority,[44] and often substituted for Baroni at major meetings.[42] \n \n Events [ edit ] \n \n During the week of August 4, 2013, Christie met with David Samson, Christie's appointed chairman of the Board of Commissioners of the Port Authority. The deputy speaker of the New Jersey Assembly, John Wisniewski, who, as chair of the Assembly Transportation Committee had been leading the Assembly's investigation into the closures, alleged that David Wildstein, the Christie appointee who ordered the closures, must have believed the meeting was related to the lane closures, because a reference to the meeting was included in the subpoenaed documents Wildstein submitted in which all information not pertaining to the Fort Lee lane closures had been redacted.[45] \n \n On August 13, Bridget Anne Kelly, deputy chief of staff in Christie's office, sent an eight-word e-mail to David Wildstein that read, \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\"[46] Wildstein responded to Kelly's e-mail: \"Got it.\"[47] \n \n On September 6, Wildstein instructed George Washington Bridge manager Robert Durando not to tell anyone in Fort Lee about the upcoming closure, not even the police. When Durando questioned the order, which he thought was \"odd\" since he had never been instructed in his 35-year career not to tell host town officials about an event that would disrupt traffic, Wildstein told him \"it would impact the study\" if people knew and Wildstein \"wanted to see what would naturally happen\".[48] \n \n Wildstein sent an e-mail the same day to Kelly informing her that Christie had approved $60,000 to fund a traffic study for Springfield in Union County. The Democratic mayor, David Amlen, did not endorse Christie for re-election and was not informed of the approval of their requested traffic study until after Christie won re-election.[49] \n \n Closure [ edit ] \n \n On Monday, September 9, 2013, prior to the morning rush hour on the first day of the school year,[50] two of the three dedicated toll lanes at one of the Fort Lee entrances[3][4] to the upper level of the GW Bridge were closed to local use, and were reallocated to the main highway traffic, on orders from Wildstein without notification to Fort Lee government and police officials. In an area that normally experiences a great deal of traffic, the lane closings caused a significant increase in traffic congestion. This led to major delays for school transportation and police and emergency responses within Fort Lee, both during and after the peak hours of travel.[4][50] \n \n According to the Fort Lee emergency medical services coordinator, traffic jams delayed paramedic response times, including a 9-1-1 call for Florence Genova, who subsequently died of cardiac arrest.[51][52] In January 2014, her daughter told The New York Times that she \"wants to stay out of it. It's not political\". She noted her mother's advanced age (91) and opined that \"it was just her time\".[53] \n \n In at least one instance, emergency medical workers were forced to leave their ambulance and respond on foot because traffic congestion was so heavy. Emergency responders were delayed nearly one hour in rendering assistance to a man experiencing chest pains.[55] \n \n Within hours of the closure, various Port Authority officials were being told that the traffic delays posed a threat to public safety. At 9:29 a.m., Matthew Bell, a special assistant to Bill Baroni, e-mailed Baroni regarding \"urgent matter of public safety in Fort Lee\". Fort Lee Borough Administrator Peggy Thomas e-mailed the PA's director of government and community relations, Tina Lado, with her concerns, noting that police and emergency departments received no advance notice of the closures.[56] At 11:24 a.m., Lado e-mailed both Wildstein and Baroni informing them that due to the closures, police and ambulances were having difficulty responding to emergencies. That e-mail noted two specific incidents: a missing child (later found) and a cardiac arrest.[57][58] These safety warnings were reportedly ignored.[56] \n \n At the federal trial of Baroni and Kelly, Fort Lee Police Chief Keith Bendul testified that he had reached Durando on that Monday, who asked for a meeting not at the PA office, but in a nearby municipal parking lot. \"I thought it was cloak and dagger.\" Durando spoke of the traffic study, and Bendul demanded its ending, citing the various safety problems. \"I told [Durando] bluntly that if anybody dies, I'm going to tell those people to sue him and everybody at the Port Authority.\" A nervous Durando told Bendul that Sokolich should contact Baroni, and added that \"if anybody asked if this meeting occurred, he [Durando] would deny it,\" Bendul testified.[59] \n \n Deputy Chief of Staff Bridget Kelly e-mailed Wildstein and asked about his response, if any, to Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich. Wildstein responded: \"Radio silence. His name comes right after Mayor Fulop [of Jersey City].\"[60] \n \n PAPD Lieutenant Thomas \"Chip\" Michaels, a Christie childhood friend,[61] ordered his subordinates not to touch the cones,[62] and chauffeured Wildstein around the Fort Lee area on an observation tour,[61] and updated Wildstein on traffic conditions throughout the week, via text messages.[61] \n \n On Tuesday, September 10, Sokolich texted Baroni: \"Presently we have four very busy traffic lanes merging into only one toll booth ... bigger problem is getting kids to school. Help please. It's maddening.\"[41] Kelly's text message exchange with Wildstein referred to the mayor's message. Kelly asked, \"Is it wrong that I am smiling?\" Wildstein replied, \"No.\" Kelly then wrote, \"I feel badly about the kids. I guess.\" Wildstein responded, \"They are the children of Buono voters,\" referring to Barbara Buono, Christie's Democratic opponent in the November election.[61][63][64] \n \n Twelve-year veteran PAPD Officer Steve Pisciotta was stationed near the affected entrance, and reported over his radio about hazardous conditions created by the severe traffic. PAPD Deputy Inspector Darcy Licorish radioed back, \"Shut up,\" and that there should be no over-the-air discussion of the closure. Lt. Michaels and PAPD Sgt. Nadine Rhem later visited Pisciotta in person, warning that his communication was inappropriate.[65] \n \n On Wednesday, September 11, Robert Durando said in a Port Authority e-mail that if the automated toll lanes were closed permanently in favor of one manned lane for local traffic, it would be \"very expensive\" since annual toll-collector costs would increase approximately $600,000. This would have covered overtime, as well as stationing reserve employees when a scheduled toll collector was not able to work. He said there would be additional, but still to be determined costs, for PA police due to their coverage of traffic for a greatly extended rush hour.[66][67] \n \n Christie, Wildstein, Samson and Baroni were photographed together at the site of the World Trade Center during a commemoration of the 12th anniversary of the terrorist attacks.[10] On that occasion, Wildstein later testified, Baroni sarcastically told Christie, \"Governor, there is a tremendous amount of traffic in Fort Lee, please know Mayor Sokolich is frustrated he can't get his calls returned,\" to which Christie was said to have responded, \"I imagine they wouldn't be getting their calls returned.\" According to Wildstein, Baroni then told Christie that Wildstein would monitor the traffic, and Christie responded, \"Well, I'm sure Mr. Edge wouldn't be involved in anything political,\" and laughed.[68][69] (\"Wally Edge\" was the pseudonymous persona used by Wildstein in his earlier highly political blog.)[42] \n \n On Thursday, September 12, PA engineers said that reported delays for local traffic greatly exceeded any time savings for the major highway traffic based on reported information for vehicle travel times on Interstate 95 and local traffic counts from that week. In an internal PowerPoint presentation, it was estimated that the extra daily morning rush hour time, 2,800 vehicle-hours, endured by local traffic on a typical day greatly outweighed time savings, 966 vehicle-hours, for the I-95 traffic.[70] \n \n Sokolich wrote to Baroni that \"many members of the public have informed me that the PA police officers are advising commuters ... that this recent traffic debacle is the result of a decision that I, as the Mayor, recently made.\"[71] \n \n According to his later testimony, John Ma (the chief of staff to the Port Authority's executive director, Patrick Foye), with Foye's knowledge beforehand, tipped off John Cichowski, the \"Road Warrior\" columnist for The Record. \"I told him, off the record, that to my knowledge there was no traffic study and that the lane closures had been ordered by David Wildstein.\"[72] Cichowski contacted the PA to ask about the delays, and this contact appeared on that evening's internal PA report of media contacts, getting the attention of Foye.[73] \n \n Re-opening and immediate aftermath [ edit ] \n \n On Friday morning, September 13, 2013, Patrick Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority and an appointee of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, ordered that the lanes be reopened in a strongly worded 7:44 AM e-mail to senior PA officials and staff, including Bill Baroni and David Samson. In the e-mail, Foye called the decision to close the lanes \"hasty and ill-advised\", said that the decision violated policy and long-standing custom at the PA, and that he believed that closing the lanes \"violates Federal Law and the laws of both States.\" Foye asked his spokesman to get the word out. Upon learning this, Baroni attempted to prevent any disclosure in order to keep the public in the dark.[74][75] Additionally, Baroni forwarded the e-mail to Regina Egea, Christie's Director of the authorities unit overseeing the PA, three hours after it was sent by Foye.[67][76] \n \n Foye would later testify that Baroni met with him two times on that Friday, pressing for reinstatement of the closure, saying it was \"important to Trenton,\" or else \"Trenton\" would call, which Foye understood to mean Christie's office. \"I said they should call,\" Foye testified. \"I opened [the lanes], I was not closing them.\" However, Foye did approve a press release that he knew falsely cited a \"traffic study.\"[77] \n \n During and after the lane closures, \"hundreds of pages of e-mails and internal documents\" showed \"how Christie loyalists inside the PA worked to orchestrate a cover-up after traffic mayhem\" in Fort Lee. In September, as more reporters began asking about the GW Bridge problems, officials conferred on how to respond.[78] On September 13, The Record reported the outrage commuters were expressing toward the PA following days of long, inbound delays, and Fort Lee officials' unsuccessful efforts to get an explanation.[79] Then on September 16, a Wall Street Journal reporter asked PA spokesman Coleman about what had occurred after some Journal editors had been in traffic the previous week. \"Coleman passed the query up the chain of command\" and Wildstein forwarded it to Baroni, commenting \"I call bullshit on this.\" Further inquiries were directed by Coleman to Baroni and Wildstein, asking how they wanted the PA to respond, and Wildstein forwarded one of these inquiries to Christie's press secretary and chief spokesman, Michael Drewniak. Coleman also wrote to Baroni and Wildstein, \"I will not respond unless instructed to do so.\"[78] \n \n On September 17, Wildstein informed Baroni that he had received a call from Wall Street Journal reporter Tedd Mann. \"Jesus\", Baroni replied, \"Call Drewniak\".[11] \n \n The e-mails showed efforts by Christie appointees in the PA and his office in Trenton to respond to the aftermath and media inquiries for the toll lane closures. The participants included Baroni, Wildstein, and PA Chairman Samson, as well as Drewniak and Maria Comella, Communications Director. In a September 18 e-mail, Samson warned that Foye is \"playing in traffic, made a big mistake\" in response to a leak to The Wall Street Journal for their September 17 story citing unnamed PA officials as saying the decision to close the toll lanes had caused tensions within the bi-state agency.[8][80] \n \n In other communications, officials used an ethnic pejorative to refer to the Fort Lee mayor. In an e-mail from Wildstein responding to Bill Stepien, he said \"It will be a tough November for this little Serbian\", derogatorily referring to Sokolich, who is Croatian-American.[81] Baroni referred to \"Serbia\" in text messages in another apparent reference to Mayor Sokolich.[82][83] Sokolich told The Huffington Post: \"That slight is offensive to me, and it's offensive to me of everyone of Serbian background. If I were Serbian, I would be absolutely, positively appalled by it.\"[84] The Serbian remarks received the attention of Serbian and Croatian media, and was commented upon by the Serbian government's Office for Cooperation with the Diaspora and Serbs in the Region.[84] \n \n On October 9, Philippe Danielides, a senior adviser to Samson, e-mailed Wildstein a daily news summary and asked \"Has any thought been given to writing an op-ed or providing a statement about the GWB study? Or is the plan just to hunker down and grit our way through it?\" Wildstein replied \"Yes and yes\" and forwarded these e-mails to Baroni.[78] Wildstein sought advice from Drewniak, with the two meeting in person on December 4.[85] On December 6, Wildstein announced he would resign at the end of the year, saying the response to the traffic lanes closure had become \"a distraction\". At a December 13 press conference, Christie announced the immediate resignations of Baroni and Wildstein.[11] \n \n David Samson allegations [ edit ] \n \n In the wake of the lane closings, the Port Authority's chairman David Samson was the subject of media reports alleging ethical violations and conflicts of interest. It was alleged that Samson's law firm and their clients profited from dealings with the Port Authority and from projects involving New Jersey government financing or tax incentives. It was also reported that Christie benefited politically and his allies benefited financially during Samson's term as chairman.[86] Patrick Foye, the Port Authority's executive director, asserted that Samson lacked the moral authority to run the agency.[87] \n \n Calls for Samson's resignation or removal came from New Jersey officials and media sources, including The Star-Ledger,[88] The Daily News (New York),[89] The Record,[90] and The New York Times.[91] On March 4, the freeholders in Bergen County, where Fort Lee is located, called for the resignation of Samson and the other five New Jersey appointed commissioners, with the commissioners faulted for failure to exercise proper oversight.[92] \n \n In February 2014, Christie stood firmly behind his support of Samson as PA chairman.[93] \n \n On March 28, 2014, Christie announced that Samson had offered his resignation from the Port Authority, effective immediately. They both agreed with the recommended Port Authority reforms in the March 26 report commissioned by the governor's office for an investigation of Bridgegate allegations. The report did not mention any involvement by Samson (who had refused to be interviewed) in any Bridgegate events, or any of the other allegations during his role as PA chairman.[94][95] On April 29, 2014, Christie nominated John J. Degnan, a former state attorney general, as Samson's replacement, later confirmed by the New Jersey state senate.[96][97] \n \n On July 14, 2016, Samson pleaded guilty to a felony for conspiring to impede an airplane hangar project that was important to United Airlines in order to force the airline to reinstate a discontinued flight from Newark Airport to Columbia, South Carolina. U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman declined to say whether Samson would be cooperating in the Bridgegate case.[15][98] \n \n Possible motives [ edit ] \n \n The May 2015 indictments of Wildstein, Baroni and Kelly contend that the lane closures were political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for not supporting Christie in the 2013 New Jersey gubernatorial election.[99] Sokolich initially claimed that he was asked for an endorsement once, in the spring of 2013, months before the August \"time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\" e-mail by Bridget Kelly to David Wildstein.[41][100] Although the two men are from different parties and an endorsement would normally not be expected, Christie ran on a platform of bipartisanship and had secured the endorsement of many other Democratic officials.[41] \n \n In an interview on February 6, 2014, with The Record, Sokolich said that the Christie administration had courted his endorsement over a period of time going back to around 2010, when Christie invited Sokolich and a handful of other mayors, including Hoboken's Dawn Zimmer, to have lunch at the governor's mansion in Princeton. Christie was shown in a picture talking with local mayors in a lineup, including Sokolich, after a news conference in Teaneck on December 8, 2011. In 2012, Sokolich and his cousins were given a personal tour of the 9/11 Memorial Plaza by Wildstein, who repeatedly told Sokolich, \"I've been told to be nice to you.\" Matt Mowers, regional political director for Christie's re-election campaign, who had previously worked in the governor's intergovernmental affairs office, met with Sokolich regularly in 2013 and told him about other Democrats who endorsed Christie for governor. On at least three occasions, Sokolich noted that Mowers brought up the subject of Sokolich's possible endorsement. Sokolich eventually supported Barbara Buono, Christie's Democratic opponent in the 2013 election.[101] Christie said at his January 9, 2014, press conference that Sokolich was \"never on my radar screen\" and that he would not \"have been able to pick him [Sokolich] out of a lineup.\"[102] \n \n E-mails indicated that Wildstein and Baroni were aware the closures would harm Sokolich. In an e-mail from Wildstein responding to Bill Stepien,[74] Wildstein wrote \"It will be a tough November for this little Serbian\", derogatorily referring to Sokolich, who is Croatian-American.[81] Baroni referred to \"Serbia\" in text messages in another apparent reference to mayor Sokolich.[82][83] \n \n The May 2015 indictment, citing text messages between Wildstein, Baroni and Kelly, contended that the lane closures were designed to have maximum impact upon motorists and the city of Fort Lee. The closures targeted the first day of school, and deliberately steered cars to the cash lane, so as to maximize traffic disruption in the surrounding areas. The New York Times reported that \"the three plotting like petulant and juvenile pranksters, using government resources, time and personnel to punish a public official whose sole offense was failing to endorse their political patron. The three were in constant contact, brazenly using government e-mails, their tone sometimes almost giddy. They even gave the increasingly desperate mayor of Fort Lee their own version of the silent treatment.\"[99] \n \n Another theory had claimed that the closures were intended to affect Sokolich's promotion of Hudson Lights,[103] a $1 billion redevelopment project that was underway at the Fort Lee bridge access point.[104][105][106] It has been noted that \"the Hudson Lights project is a billion-dollar project because it offers unparalleled access to the George Washington Bridge. But take away that access and it's no longer a billion-dollar project.\"[107] In a September 12, 2013, e-mail to Bill Baroni, during the time when the closure was still on-going, Mayor Sokolich raised concerns about the redevelopment project, asking \"What do I do when our billion-dollar development is put on line at the end of next year?\"[108] \n \n Another theory was that the retaliation was for Sokolich's opposition to the PA's recent toll hike.[73][79] \n \n On January 9, 2014, Steven Fulop, Mayor of Jersey City, alleged that he was also targeted for political reprisals by the Christie administration for declining to endorse Christie in the 2013 governor election.[109] His claim may be supported by a September 9, 2013, e-mail by David Wildstein after Bridget Kelly asked about his response to Fort Lee Mayor Sokolich about the toll lane closures. Wildstein responded: \"Radio silence. His name comes right after Mayor Fulop.\"[60] \n \n Investigations [ edit ] \n \n According to The New York Times, the e-mails discussing the lane closure \"could represent evidence that government resources were used for political purposes, a potential crime\".[41] According to legal experts, federal prosecutors also could \"examine whether the obstruction of interstate commerce on the bridge between New Jersey and New York\" violated federal law, and either federal or state prosecutors also might \"build a cover-up case, rather than one based on the traffic tie-ups themselves\".[110] \n \n On January 17, 2014, Alan Zegas, Wildstein's attorney, said that his client would offer to shed light on the scandal on the condition that he was given immunity from prosecution from the relevant federal and state law enforcement agencies. There had not been any offer of immunity from the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey.[111] \n \n A joint legislative committee, New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation, was created on January 27, 2014, to take over the original investigation by the Assembly Transportation Committee.[112] \n \n Assembly Transportation Committee investigation [ edit ] \n \n On October 2, 2013, Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex), said that he would open an investigation with the Assembly Transportation Committee to determine whether or not the lane closures were politically motivated. \n \n The first hearing was held on November 25, 2013, for which Bill Baroni attended on behalf of the PA. Baroni, who was not sworn in to testify under oath, said that David Wildstein had ordered a study to determine if closing two of the Fort Lee toll lanes, and assigning them to mainline traffic, would shorten delays for commuters from other parts of New Jersey. Baroni argued that it was unfair that Fort Lee drivers occupied three out of the 12 lanes on the upper level, despite being only 4.5% of all traffic. Committee members pointed out that 4.5% was based on the number of E-ZPass users from Fort Lee that use all approaches to the bridge, and that vehicles from many other towns, besides Fort Lee, use that Fort Lee entrance. He admitted the actual percentage of vehicles, which utilize that Fort Lee entrance, could be higher than 4.5% of overall traffic, and also failed to mention that there are actually 29 operating toll lanes for the bridge when comparing the three dedicated toll lanes for this entrance.[113][114] \n \n Wildstein turned over heavily redacted documents in response to the subpoena. \n \n Baroni said that with the reduction in Fort Lee toll lanes, traffic data showed that the mainline traffic travel times in the express lanes' approach to the bridge were about four minutes faster on two days. He apologized for what he acknowledged was the agency's failure to properly communicate with local officials and the public in advance of this project.[113][115] Following the hearing, Wisniewski called the closures at best \"clumsy and ham-handed\" and at worst \"political mischief by a political appointee and another political appointee that they did not make available for testimony\", referring to Wildstein's non-attendance.[116] \n \n Immediately after Baroni made his presentation, a text exchange occurred, according to subpoenaed documents from Wildstein. Wildstein said \"you did great\" and said that the \"Trenton feedback\" was good.[117][118] \n \n Sen. Kevin O'Toole released a statement that day to the media, echoing various talking points from Baroni's presentation. All of this suggested that O'Toole had prior communications with Wildstein and possibly Baroni.[119] \n \n Wisniewski subpoenaed Foye and career PA staffers to give sworn testimony on December 9, 2013, about the lane closures.[120][121] The committee had gotten subpoena power only because the PA had been stonewalling the delivery of documents in an unrelated investigation of a controversial toll hike. \"Had the Port Authority simply complied with the requests, there probably wouldn't have been a rationale for the committee to get subpoena power,\" Wisniewski later said.[122] \n \n Robert Durando, George Washington Bridge manager, said that he feared retaliation if he did not follow Wildstein's orders to close two toll lanes to local traffic and not notify local officials or the public about these changes. Durando and Cedrick Fulton, director of tunnels, bridges, and terminals, both said that they were personally told by Wildstein that he would notify Foye of the change.[48][123] Foye said that he was unaware of any traffic study until he ordered its termination on September 13, 2013, and blamed Wildstein for the toll lane changes, while believing Baroni was involved in the planning.[37][124] When Wildstein called Fulton on September 6, 2013, to inform him that the lane closures would begin on September 9, Fulton explained that he thought that was unusual since planning for traffic disruptions on major facilities typically starts years in advance. He said that he told Wildstein, \"This will not end well\", due to expected traffic problems.[48] \n \n Redacted documents were turned over under a subpoena to investigators of the committee and those documents were turned over to The New York Times and other news media.[41][125] On January 8, 2014, The Star-Ledger, The Record, The New York Times, and other news media published e-mails and text messages tying Bridget Kelly, deputy chief of staff in Christie's office, to the closure. The content of the released communications said that the lane closures were ordered with the knowledge that they would cause a massive traffic jam.[126][127] Christie released a statement later that day denying knowledge of the scandal, rebuking Kelly for her role in the lane closure event, and vowing that \"people will be held responsible for their actions\" in the affair.[128] \n \n A Republican member of the Assembly committee complained that the Republican members had not been given sufficient time to review the subpoenaed documents in advance of hearing testimony: \"Allowing Republican committee members less than 24 hours to review more than 900 pages of information is a disservice to the bipartisan committee process ... As chairman, he [Wisniewski] should be impartial and provide committee members, regardless of their political affiliation, a reasonable opportunity to review documents he has had access to for weeks\".[129] \n \n On January 9, 2014, David Wildstein, who appeared with his attorney, Alan Zegas, refused to testify before the committee, invoking the right against self-incrimination in the federal and New Jersey constitutions. The committee voted to hold Wildstein in contempt, asserting that the right against self-incrimination did not apply in such a hearing.[130][131] \n \n Wisniewski said \"I do think laws have been broken. Public resources\u2014the bridge, police officers\u2014all were used for a political purpose, for some type of retribution, and that violates the law\".[132] He called it \"unbelievable\"[133] that Christie did not know anything about his aides' plans, stating: \"It's hard to really accept the governor's statement that he knew nothing until the other morning\". He also raised the issue of the potential for Christie's impeachment if Christie was aware of his aides' actions.[134] \n \n Special legislative investigative committees [ edit ] \n \n On January 16, 2014, the New Jersey Assembly and Senate each created committees to take over the investigation from the Assembly Transportation Committee. The Assembly committee hired Reid Schar as special counsel, who would assist in the investigation. He is a former assistant U.S. attorney from Illinois who assisted in the prosecution of former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich.[135][136] \n \n The New Jersey Assembly re-authorized the legislative subpoena powers, which were immediately used to subpoena two organizations and 18 individuals in Christie's administration, the governor's office, his 2013 election campaign, and the Port Authority, but not Christie himself. Those receiving subpoenas were instructed to submit by February 3, 2014, all documents and communications, going back to September 1, 2012, related to the reassignment of the two toll lanes during the week of September 9, 2013, and any attempts to conceal the activities or reasons related to that incident.[137] \n \n New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation [ edit ] \n \n On January 21, 2014, Assemblyman Wisniewski and State Senate majority leader Loretta Weinberg, whose district includes Fort Lee, announced that the Senate and Assembly committees were being merged into a bi-partisan joint investigative committee of 12 members, and that they would co-chair the New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation. While the committee initially focused on the Bridgegate scandal, it had the power to investigate other allegations against the Christie administration.[112][138] \n \n On January 24, 2014, the members of the bi-partisan committee were announced, consisting of eight Assembly representatives (five Democrats and three Republicans), and four Senators (three Democrats and one Republican). At the time, 40% of the members of the New Jersey Legislature were Republican. Besides the two Democratic co-chairs, members included Assemblywoman Marlene Caride (D-Bergen), Assemblyman Michael Patrick Carroll (R-Morris), Senator Nia Gill (D-Essex), Senator Linda Greenstein (D-Middlesex), Assembly Majority Leader Louis Greenwald (D-Camden), Assemblywoman Amy Handlin (R-Monmouth), Assemblywoman Valerie Huttle (D-Bergen), Assemblywoman Holly Schepisi (R-Bergen), Assemblywoman Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-Mercer), and an unnamed Republican Senator.[139] On January 27, both houses voted unanimously to combine the investigations, maintaining the partisan balance, and announced Senator Kevin O'Toole's (R-Essex) to fill the last spot,[140] despite his mention in a December 5 e-mail from Wildstein to Michael Drewniak.[141] \n \n As a precautionary move, the new investigative committee re-issued subpoenas that had been sent earlier, with the requested records still due on the original deadline, February 3.[142] \n \n In a January 31, 2014, letter to Reid Schar, general counsel for the legislative committee, Kevin Marino, the attorney for Stepien, said that he would not submit anything in response to their subpoena and requested its withdrawal, citing his client's Fifth Amendment right and New Jersey common law privileges against self-incrimination, with regard to the criminal inquiry underway by the U.S. Attorney, and Fourth Amendment and New Jersey Constitution (Article I, paragraph 7) rights against unreasonable search and seizure. Wisniewski said the subpoena was perfectly sound, and that Schar would review the attorney's objections and consider the committee's legal options.[143][144] Michael Critchley, the attorney for Kelly, submitted a letter that his client would not comply with the subpoena based on similar claims.[145] \n \n On February 3, 2014, Wisniewski and Weinberg issued a statement, without details, that some responses to subpoenas had been received and that extensions for submissions had been granted to others. Mark Sheridan, an attorney for Christie's campaign organization, said it had been granted an extension while it awaited an opinion from the state Election Law Enforcement Commission, which on February 11 allowed the campaign to use existing funds and raise funds to pay its legal bills in response to the NJ Legislature and federal subpoenas for general evidence. It could not use those funds in response to any criminal investigations.[146][147] \n \n On February 10, 2014, the committee voted to reject the objections raised by the lawyers of Stepien and Kelly to not comply with the subpoenas for their records, and to compel Stepien and Kelly to produce all related documents, instructing special counsel Reid Schar to \"take all necessary steps\" to enforce the subpoenas. All four Republicans abstained in the vote. They claimed that they did not have enough time to review the legal arguments, including Fifth Amendment rights, presented in Schar's legal brief countering the lawyers' objections.[148][149] \n \n On the same day, the committee announced it was issuing 18 new subpoenas to individuals within the governor's office and the Port Authority that also included new recipients, as well as the governor's office itself and Christie's 2013 re-election campaign. The new recipients included assistants to Foye, Wildstein, Baroni, and Kelly. Other new PA recipients included Christie referral, Philip Kwon, deputy general counsel, Christie appointee William \"Pat\" Schuber, a commissioner, who had served in a variety of local, county, and state elected positions in New Jersey, and Steve Coleman, deputy director of media relations.[150][151] One of the subpoenas was sent to the New Jersey State Police aviation unit for flight information records when Christie used a state helicopter during the toll lane closings. An agency spokesperson said that Christie had not used one to fly over the Fort Lee area during the lane closings.[152] The subpoenas also sought information related to any dossiers[153] compiled by Christie's re-election campaign and his governor's office on Fort Lee Mayor Sokolich.[154] \n \n The subpoenas sought information for records from staff at the PA and the governor's office related to preparations for Baroni's presentation to the Assembly Transportation Committee's November 25, 2013, hearing.[154] Wildstein's attorney had claimed that Wildstein was present during some of the times when Kwon, who attended the committee hearing, helped prepare Baroni over several days for his presentation about a traffic study and other issues related to the local toll lane closures. A PA spokesman said: \"Meeting with a witness prior to testimony is a routine function of any lawyer and any attempt to assign ulterior motives to this general practice is unwarranted.\" Kwon served as first assistant attorney general during Christie's first term as governor and previously worked for him in the U.S. Attorney General's office in New Jersey. He was also Christie's 2012 Supreme Court justice nominee, who was blocked by Democratic state legislative members.[155] \n \n One of the subpoenas sought documents from the PANYNJ related to toll increases for the tunnels and bridges and Christie's 2010 decision to cancel the Access to the Region's Core project, specifically with regard to projected cost overruns. It also requested the names of job candidates sent by Christie's office to the agency.[154] \n \n On February 19, 2014, it was reported that the co-chairs said that the committee would need to question Senator O'Toole about what he knew, including any communications with Baroni and/or Wildstein, prior to Baroni's November 25 presentation to the Assembly Transportation Committee. A previously redacted November 25 text message from Wildstein to Baroni said that O'Toole was ready with a statement, which was issued to the media, that echoed talking points from Baroni's same day presentation and attacked the Democrats investigating these issues. O'Toole followed up with an editorial in The Record that elaborated on these talking points and attacks. It raised further questions on whether O'Toole should continue to serve on the committee.[118][119] \n \n On February 28, 2014, Bonnie Watson Coleman withdrew from the committee, a day after she called on Christie to resign as governor due to the culture of bullying she says was fostered under him.[156] On March 21, 2014, Assembly Speaker Vincent Pietro named Assemblyman Paul Moriarty (D-Camden) to fill that vacancy.[157] \n \n On March 31, 2014, Wisniewski announced the intention to subpoena notes, records, and interviews from the inquiry conducted for the governor's office by Randy Mastro of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, since they had not been made available to the committee. Wisniewski said that there would be questions about the objectivity and independence of that investigation if subpoenaed items were withheld. In response, Mastro released a statement saying that the governor's office did not release interview transcripts because of its cooperation with the U.S. Attorney's Office's investigation and would respond to any subpoena request, when received. These matters could go to court if the governor's office tried to exercise any rights not to provide subpoenaed items.[158][159] On April 11, 2014, the committee received the list of 75 persons interviewed by Mastro's team.[160][161] Wisniewski said that he expected all existing interview materials in \"whatever form\", or the committee would issue a subpoena.[161] The interview notes, marked \"privileged and confidential attorney opinion work product\", were turned over to the legislative committee and U.S. Attorney's Office, and publicly released online on April 14, without a subpoena. Wisniewski and Weinberg said in a joint statement that the committee reserved the right to request or subpoena further information, if required.[162] \n \n On April 9, 2014, the committee's investigation was dealt a setback when New Jersey Superior Court Judge Mary Jacobson ruled that Stepien and Kelly do not have to hand over subpoenaed documents since the subpoenas were written too broadly, like a \"fishing expedition\".[163][164] The judge also said that the subpoenas, as written, \"clearly violate\" federal and state protections against self-incrimination and unlawful search and seizure.[164] The ruling said that Kelly and Stepien could assert their Fifth Amendment rights because of the investigation by the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey, and these documents could provide a \"link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a federal crime\".[165] The judge suggested that the committee could consider reissuing subpoenas with more limited document requests that could be acceptable. Legal experts agreed with that approach, and also suggested that electronic copies of the original subpoenaed documents could be obtained through subpoenas of system servers that store those documents since individuals do not have any personal right to bar the subpoena of a server.[163] \n \n The judge also expressed reservations about having jurisdictional powers to compel the turnover of subpoenaed documents since \"the committee has the power to enforce its own subpoenas through orders to compel and grant immunity in return.\" The lawyers for Stepien and Kelly have contended that the committee could grant their clients immunity from criminal prosecution in exchange for the documents. Reid Schar said that the committee had no such powers.[166] \n \n Wisniewski forecast that \"north of ten\" people would be subpoenaed for testimony.[167] On April 22, 2014, he announced the joint committee's first subpoenas for oral testimony, initially calling four witnesses to testify: Christina Genovese Renna (former director of intergovernmental affairs), William \"Pat\" Schuber (a PA commissioner), Patrick Foye, and Michael Drewniak.[168] All four agreed to testify.[167] After a subpoena on April 29 calling Matt Mowers (former campaign staffer who reportedly asked Sokolich for an endorsement, and who has been cooperating with the committee),[167] and some schedule adjustments, testimony was set for May 6 (Renna), May 13 (Drewniak), May 20 (Mowers), and June 3 (Foye and Schuber).[169] However, the committee later postponed Foye's testimony, at the request of the US Attorney.[170] Kevin O'Dowd (chief of staff and nominee for attorney general) was subpoenaed to testify on June 9.[171][172] The committee was considering issuing a second set of more narrowly focused subpoenas to Bridget Kelly and Bill Stepien. Christie would not be subpoenaed.[173] \n \n On May 7, 2014, the committee announced a subpoena for documents and records from Michael DuHaime (Christie's chief political strategist).[174][175] According to the Gibson Dunn memo on the DuHaime interview, he told Christie \"on or about\" December 11, 2013, that Wildstein, Stepien, and Kelly had knowledge of the \"traffic study\" beforehand. During Christie's December 13 news conference, he denied involvement by anyone in his office.[176] \n \n Committee work slowed in July 2014, and they postponed or skipped some witnesses' testimony, in deference to the federal investigation.[177][178] On July 17, it heard testimony from Regina Egea, Christie's Chief of Staff, who had learned of the lane closures on September 13, 2013, after their reversal[179] and who had later assisted Bill Baroni prepare for his testimony, but she was not accused of wrongdoing.[180] \n \n Port Authority investigation [ edit ] \n \n On October 16, 2013, the Port Authority announced that it would conduct an internal review.[181] Its inspector general opened an investigation on December 10.[182] On February 16, 2014, Executive Director Pat Foye ordered the inspector general and PA Police Chief Louis Koumoutsos to examine PA Police Lieutenant Thomas \"Chip\" Michaels for his role in chauffeuring Wildstein on an observation tour on the first day of the closures and allegations of PA Police officers telling frustrated motorists to direct their ire at Mayor Sokolich. Michaels had at least one day's advance knowledge of the closure.[183][184] Lt. Michaels and his brother Jeffrey Michaels (a GOP lobbyist in Trenton) are childhood friends of Christie.[61] \n \n The PA investigation reportedly interviewed only 3 people (Wildstein not among them), and was finished within a few weeks, although PA officials still continued to claim \"ongoing investigation\" a month later, when deflecting reporters' questions.[185] \n \n U.S. Attorney investigation [ edit ] \n \n On January 9, 2014, Paul J. Fishman, the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, opened a preliminary federal inquiry into matters related to the toll lane closures. Fishman's office has jurisdiction because the Port Authority was created via an interstate compact between New York and New Jersey.[186] Rebekah Carmichael, public affairs officer for the U.S. attorney's office, said in a statement: \"The Port Authority Office of Inspector General has referred the matter to us, and our office is reviewing it to determine whether a federal law was implicated.\"[187] \n \n The U.S. Attorney, whose office did not identify who was being served, began an official investigation and issued grand jury subpoenas for documents related to the Bridgegate scandal to various people and entities. Mark Sheridan, a partner with Patton Boggs, which had been retained to represent Christie's 2013 re-election campaign organization and the New Jersey Republican State Committee in connection with investigations into this scandal, said on January 23, 2014, that both organizations had received subpoenas.[188][189] On February 3, Christie said that his governor's office received a subpoena. The Federal Bureau of Investigation assisted the U.S. Attorney in its investigation.[190][191] \n \n Prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's Office met with Mayor Sokolich on February 21[192] and Governor Christie's press secretary, Michael Drewniak, as a \"fact witness\", on February 27.[61] Drewniak, who had been subpoenaed by the legislative committee, was referenced in several previously subpoenaed documents released by the committee from others.[193] \n \n The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in Manhattan, issued a subpoena to PA Chairman David Samson on March 7, 2014, but then rescinded it on March 10, because of overlap with the Fishman investigation based in New Jersey.[194][195] \n \n As part of the criminal investigation, Drewniak testified on April 4, 2014, in Newark before the grand jury investigating the scandal. His lawyer, Anthony Iacullo, said he was not a target of the investigation. ABC News reported that this was the first confirmation of a convened grand jury, which can meet for up to 18 months (with further extensions possible), for interviewing witnesses. It has the power to indict, subpoena, and interview witnesses without their attorneys being present.[196] The New York Times reported that it was the same grand jury that had reviewed subpoenaed documents.[197] \n \n On April 7, 2014, it was reported that David Wildstein met with federal prosecutors in Newark for several days during the week of March 31 and Charlie McKenna met with investigators in mid-January in Fishman's office.[198] \n \n On April 25, 2014, it was reported that Fishman had subpoenaed the New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation for \"any and all records\" they have gathered, with delivery due on May 2.[199] Committee co-chairs Weinberg and Wisniewski said that they will comply, and that the request \"reaffirms\" their progress.[200] \n \n On May 1, 2014, it was reported that the federal grand jury had subpoenaed PA attorney Phillip Kwon, who had reportedly assisted preparing Bill Baroni's unsworn November 25, 2013, \"traffic study\" testimony to the Assembly Transportation Committee, and that Kwon had asked the PA to cover his legal fees.[201] \n \n On September 18, 2014, WNBC-TV4 (New York) reported that unnamed federal investigators told them that thus far no evidence that Christie knew in advance of the closures or had directed them was found, but cautioned that the investigation is ongoing and that no final determination has been made.[202] That evening's NBC report by Brian Williams, \"federal [Bridgegate] charges are now ruled out for Chris Christie\", was retracted.[203] \n \n In January 2015, it was reported that Christie was interviewed by federal prosecutors and FBI agents in December 2014. He reportedly met with investigators voluntarily to give his side of the story. The meeting lasted two hours and was described as \"professional, collegial and courteous.\"[204][205] \n \n The federal investigation led to Wildstein's guilty plea and the prosecution of Baroni and Kelly. \n \n U.S. Senate inquiry [ edit ] \n \n The United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation had opened its own inquiry into the closure. Committee chairman Jay Rockefeller (D-West Virginia) had written Samson and Vice Chairman Scott Rechler in December 2013 to demand answers about how the Port Authority handled the closure and its aftermath. According to his letter, Rockefeller, who has long been critical about shortcomings in the PA's operations, was concerned about what seemed to be evidence of \"political appointees abusing their power to hamper interstate commerce and safety without public notice.\" It also said that based on a review of recent testimony before the New Jersey Assembly Transportation Committee, it appeared that there was no traffic study underway.[206][207] Rockefeller also asked the United States Department of Transportation to conduct its own review of the incident.[208] \n \n The PA's written response to Rockefeller's questions, signed by board secretary Karen Eastman, restated and summarized the December 9, 2013, testimony by Foye and two other PA managers before the Assembly Transportation Committee. It said that the closures had been ordered by Wildstein on September 6, 2013, despite various PA engineers expressing their concerns, particularly about more traffic congestion on local streets and no advance notice to Fort Lee officials. Wildstein, the letter said, had ordered bridge officials not to notify Foye of the closures. It also revealed that the PA's board had not approved Baroni's November 25 presentation before that committee, that the closures were part of a traffic study. It showed that PA's procedures for planning and internal notifications for any traffic study were not followed. However, the letter did not reveal any reason why the closures were ordered. It characterized the incident as \"aberrational\".[209][210] Rockefeller declared that based on the PA's response, there was \"zero evidence\" that a \"legitimate\" traffic study had been planned. He also said that the letter revealed the PA had not followed its own procedures for lane closures.[211] \n \n Other closure-related probes [ edit ] \n \n The lane-closure scandal also sparked inquiries by the Manhattan District Attorney's office and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC and Manhattan DA probes are focusing on the Pulaski Skyway, an elevated highway linking Newark and Jersey City. On June 23, 2014, The New York Times reported that the inquiries are focusing on possible securities law violations caused by Christie's use of Port Authority funds to pay for repairs to the Skyway in 2010 and 2011, using money that was to be used on a new Hudson River rail tunnel that Christie canceled in October 2010.[212] \n \n Indictments and trial of Baroni and Kelly [ edit ] \n \n On May 1, 2015, the U.S. Attorney unsealed indictments, charging Bill Baroni and Bridget Anne Kelly with nine counts of conspiracy, fraud and related charges. These included conspiracy to commit fraud by \"knowingly converting and intentionally misapplying property of an organization receiving federal benefits\". That same day, prosecutors released David Wildstein's plea bargain. He had agreed in January to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy against civil rights.[213] Wildstein, whose sentencing was delayed until after the trial, agreed to testify against Baroni and Kelly.[214] \n \n The indictments charge that the lane closures were retribution against Sokolich for not endorsing Christie. Fishman said that Wildstein had corroborated the allegations in the indictments,[213] and said that the three officials \"agreed to and did use public resources to carry out a vendetta and exact retribution,\" and that they \"callously victimized the people of Fort Lee.\"[215] Kelly vigorously denied wrongdoing.[216] Baroni argued that his indictment was improperly based on the unsworn testimony and documents he had provided to the legislative committee in 2014, but prosecutors countered that he had not been offered immunity at that time.[217] \n \n The trial for Baroni and Kelly, originally scheduled to begin July 7, 2015, was repeatedly rescheduled, first to November 16, 2015, to allow more time for the defense to review the large volume of documents provided by the prosecutors,[218][219] then to May 16, 2016, and then to September 12, 2016.[220] \n \n Prosecutors asked the court that those documents, about 1.5 million pages, be kept from public view in order to protect the privacy of unindicted co-conspirators, but the defense teams opposed that proposal as overly broad, and preventing collaboration with anyone who could assist but would not be a witness.[221] U.S. District Court Judge Susan Wigenton ruled on July 7 in favor of the prosecutors, writing, \"The Confidential Discovery Materials shall not be disclosed by defense counsel to anyone other than the defendants and any agent working at the direction of defense counsel in this matter.\"[222] thereby preventing public access to certain items presented as evidence in the criminal case.[223] Media outlets\u2014including The Associated Press, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Star-Ledger, and The Record\u2014requested a hearing with Wigenton to ask that the ban be lifted or modified arguing for the First Amendment right of access to criminal court records.[223][224] \n \n Those news organizations together asked the court to release the prosecution's list of unindicted co-conspirators. On February 17, 2016, U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman's office filed a brief to Wigenton requesting that the Bridgegate records remain sealed so that the list of uncharged third-party co-conspirators not be made public. Coconspirators refers to \"individuals the government believes may have known about the plot to abruptly shut down access lanes to the bridge to cause massive traffic disruptions, but were not charged.\"[224] Fishman claimed that it was a policy of the United States Department of Justice \"to avoid unnecessary public references to wrongdoing\" by unindicted co-conspirator because they have no \"evidentiary value\" in the criminal matter. If the names were made public, then public employees or appointed officials, who were said to be involved in the lane closures, would not have the \"opportunity to challenge that information in court.\"[223] Their names would be revealed if they were relevant at a future trial or if the Government \"moves for the admission of an out-of-court statement made in furtherance of the conspiracy by an unindicted coconspirator.\"[223] \n \n On May 10, 2016, Judge Wigenton ruled for the list's release, which she said named individuals \"whom the government has sufficient evidence to designate as having joined the conspiracy.\"[225] Christie predicted that he would not appear on the list.[226] One of the men on the list filed an emergency motion, as John Doe, and the release was delayed.[227] On September 7, 2016, a federal appellate court ruled that the list, and the identity of John Doe, would remain secret for the time being, but that \"the time may come, perhaps at trial.\"[228] \n \n The media also asked for a separate existing list, which Kelly's attorney characterized as individuals \"who were not unindicted co-conspirators, but whom the government believed were aware of the alleged criminal conspiracy charged in this case but did not join the conspiracy.\"[229] \n \n The jury of seven women and five men, plus four alternates, was seated on September 14, 2016.[230][231] RNC member and former law partner Bill Palatucci, described as Christie's closest counselor,[232] may be called to testify.[233] \n \n In its opening statement on September 19, 2016, the prosecution said that at the World Trade Center site on the third day of the closure, \"the evidence will show that [Wildstein and Baroni] bragged [to Christie] about the fact that there were traffic problems in Fort Lee, and that Mayor Sokolich was not getting his calls returned,\" and that Wildstein would testify and \"admit that he was the one who came up with that idea.\"[234] \n \n Over the course of a month, prosecutors presented their case. David Wildstein appeared in week two, giving over eight days of testimony. After Wildstein left, prosecutors moved to secondary witnesses. On October 13, 2016, prosecutors concluded their arguments, having spent nearly four weeks laying an argument. The case moves to the defense to make an argument.[235][236] \n \n Over the next two weeks, the jury heard arguments from the defense, with Bridget Anne Kelly on the spotlight, saying it was \"crude humor\". Bill Baroni maintained the argument that the traffic jams were part of a legitimate study to determine \"whether congestion on the main approaches to the toll plaza could be reduced if the lanes earmarked for Fort Lee were eliminated.\" The case on October 26 concluded with the defense resting.[237][237] \n \n Convictions [ edit ] \n \n On November 4, 2016, after deliberating the testimony of 35 witnesses (including the defendants) and other evidence over the course of five days, the jury found Baroni and Kelly guilty on all counts.[14][238] \n \n On March 29, 2017, Baroni was sentenced to 24 months in prison, and Kelly was sentenced to 18 months. Appeals are expected.[239] \n \n On July 12, 2017, Wildstein received a sentence of three years' probation and 500 hours of community service.[240] \n \n Appeals [ edit ] \n \n Baroni and Kelly filed formal arguments with the 3rd District Court of Appeals on Friday, August 25, 2017.[241] \n \n Official misconduct case against Christie [ edit ] \n \n Private citizen, activist, and retired Teaneck firefighter William J. Brennan, who had attended Seton Hall Law School but is not a member of the New Jersey Bar,[242] filed a complaint in September 2016 in the Fort Lee municipal court, alleging official misconduct by Christie. The complaint specifically said that Christie had failed to stop the closure then in progress when, according to Wildstein's sworn testimony, Christie heard about it from Baroni and Wildstein on Wednesday, September 11, 2013, the third day of the closure. The complaint alleged that Fort Lee and its mayor \"were deprived the benefit and enjoyment of their community as a consequence of this intentional evil minded act.\"[243][244] \n \n On October 13, 2016, Judge Roy F. McGeady, the presiding judge for the municipal courts in Bergen County, accepted jurisdiction based on the events having occurred in Fort Lee. Christie was represented by the law firm of Alston & Bird at the Hackensack hearing. McGready ruled, \"I'm satisfied that there's probable cause to believe that an event of official misconduct was caused by Governor Christie. I'm going to issue the summons.\" The audience in the courtroom applauded.[245] \n \n That summons put the case into the hands of the Bergen County prosecutor's office, which must decide whether to bring an indictment against Christie. Prosecutor Gurbir S. Grewal was appointed by Christie, and so was expected to recuse himself.[245] \n \n The charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison.[246] \n \n Brian Murray, speaking for Christie, said the governor would appeal the ruling immediately, adding, \"this is a dishonorable complaint filed by a known serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system,\" and reiterating the governor's denial of knowledge before or during the closure.[244] \n \n A hearing on November 30, 2016, was to address[needs update] the appointment of a special prosecutor, for which Brennan has called, saying he cannot trust the objectivity of state prosecutors or the Attorney General's office.[242] \n \n In January 2017, despite request for dismissal the case was remanded to a lower court,[247][248] but prosecutors later decided not to pursue charges against Christie.[249][250] While prosecutors chose not to pursue the case, the judge ruled that it was not dismissed as had been claimed.[251] \n \n On February 17, 2017, the judge ruled that the case could proceed, saying \"The court is satisfied that [Christie] had knowledge of the traffic problems in Fort Lee\",[252] \n \n Gibson Dunn report [ edit ] \n \n On January 16, 2014, the governor's office announced the hiring of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher to assist with an internal review and cooperate with the U.S. Attorney's investigation.[253][254] The firm also agreed to assist \"with document retention and production in connection with the United States Attorney inquiry, and other appropriate inquires and requests for information\" and review the governor's office operations and information flow.[255] The lead attorney was Randy Mastro, a long time associate of Rudy Giuliani, the former Mayor of New York City and former United States Attorney. Mastro served under Giuliani as Deputy Mayor of New York City and Assistant US Attorney.[135] \n \n In February, Mastro requested interviews about the toll lane closures with Wildstein and with Sokolich and Kelly, who all declined and were not interviewed.[256][257] \n \n The report, released on March 27, 2014, found that Christie had no advance knowledge of the bridge \"lane realignment,\" and didn't know why it happened. It blamed Bridget Kelly and David Wildstein for orchestrating the toll lane closures. The report revealed that Wildstein said that he informed Christie of the ongoing lane closures during a September 11, 2013, memorial event, but asserted that Christie did not recall that exchange.[258][259] It noted that Michael Drewniak said Wildstein appeared \"anxious\" during a dinner with him on December 4, 2013, and that Wildstein \"had mentioned the Fort Lee traffic study to the Governor\" while the lane closures were taking place. Drewniak said Wildstein told him that the plan to shut the lanes and attribute it to a \"traffic study\" were Wildstein's idea, and that Kelly and Bill Stepien had \"some knowledge.\"[260] The report also found \"no evidence\" that Stepien or Baroni knew of the improper motives for the lane closures, although they were aware that the lanes were to be closed and that traffic patterns were to be changed as a result.[258] \n \n After the report was released, Christie said he was shocked by the actions of his former aides and that \"Sometimes, people do inexplicably stupid things.\"[261] \n \n The report said the lane closures were political retribution against Sokolich but did not identify the specific motive. However, it noted the day before her infamous \"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee\" message, Kelly confirmed that Sokolich would not endorse Christie. It said she was \"irate\" and \"on fire\" when a Christie aide met with Sokolich several days later.[258] \n \n The report relied on documents provided by the governor's office and interviews with 75 witnesses,[161] including Christie and others from his administration, but no one interviewed had been at the Port Authority at the time of the lane closings.[262] The interviews were not under oath.[263] The report also was based on more than 250,000 documents, many of them e-mails and text messages.[262] Transcripts of the interviews and the names of the interviewees were not released at the time the report was made public.[159] It was estimated that the taxpayer-funded report cost more than $1 million.[263] A separate section of the report rejected allegations by Hoboken's Mayor Dawn Zimmer that Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno and Richard Constable, director of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, had linked release of Hurricane Sandy relief funds to approval of a project represented by David Samson's law firm.[264] \n \n In April 2014, U.S. Internal Revenue Service filings disclosed that Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher donated $10,000 to the Republican Governors Association, of which Christie was then chairman. The contribution was made on March 18, 2014, nine days before release of the Mastro report. The firm donated $55,000 to the association from 2009 to 2012, when Christie was not its leader. It made no donations to the Democratic Governors Association from 2012 to 2014.[265][266] \n \n After Assemblyman Wisniewski gave a deadline of April 11, 2014, for providing the interview records, which were part of the basis of the report, or they would be subpoenaed, Gibson Dunn turned over on that date a list of 75 persons interviewed for the report. On April 14, the interview notes were turned over to the committee and U.S. Attorney's office, and publicly released.[161][162] Gibson Dunn lawyers said that there were no recordings or verbatim transcripts of the interviews, prompting Wisniewski to characterize the conclusions from these interviews as \"hearsay\".[267] There were nearly 370 instances in which the persons interviewed could not recall details about events they were asked to address.[162] \n \n The interview notes contained information that was downplayed or omitted from the original Mastro report, showing a governor's office in which government and political operations were deeply connected. They showed how the governor's office worked to secure Democratic endorsements and coordinated with Christie's election campaign to penalize mayors who did not endorse Christie in his re-election.[162] \n \n In July 2015, a federal court ruling ordered that materials used to prepare the report be made available to legal defense teams of those indicted.[268] \n \n Reaction to report [ edit ] \n \n Critics attacked the report as a whitewash, which they claimed read more like a legal defense than an objective investigation.[94][269][270] They noted investigators could not interview any of the most important figures in the scandal, and contended that Mastro had a conflict of interest since his firm was politically tied to Christie.[271][272] Wisniewski and Weinberg, co-chairs of the legislature investigative committee, criticized the report as incomplete and potentially biased since it was prepared by lawyers hired by the Christie administration, and the lawyers did not interview key figures in the scandal. Baroni, Kelly, Samson, Stepien, and Wildstein declined to be interviewed.[260][261] \n \n Newspaper editorials noted that one of the lawyers on the investigation team was a close friend of Christie.[94] The report was also criticized for \"sexism\" for its treatment of Christie aide Bridget Kelly.[273][274][275] \n \n A Monmouth University Polling Institute poll, released on April 2, 2014, found that 52% of New Jersey residents believed the report was conducted to help Christie's reputation.[276] At about that time, a Quinnipiac University poll found that 56% of New Jersey registered voters viewed it as a \"whitewash\", while 36% said it was a \"legitimate investigation\".[277] \n \n In May 2014, a lawyer for Bill Stepien demanded a retraction of the report's contention that Stepien lied to Christie.[278] \n \n On December 16, 2015, a United States District Court Judge issued an opinion criticizing the Gibson firm and its investigation for intentionally failing to preserve notes of interviews conducted by attorneys.[279] Judge Susan Davis Wigenton, presiding in the criminal trial of Kelly and Baroni, wrote: \"The taxpayers of the State of New Jersey paid [Gibson Dunn] millions of dollars to conduct a transparent and thorough investigation. What they got instead was opacity and gamesmanship. They deserve better.\"[279] \n \n Christie's responses [ edit ] \n \n On December 2, 2013, Christie said at a press conference that Democrats were just playing politics by holding hearings into lane closures. \"Just because [Rep.] John Wisniewski is obsessed with this, and [Sen.] Loretta Weinberg, it just shows that they really have nothing to do,\" Christie said.[280] Christie later credited the e-mail documents subpoenaed by the hearings as the first information he had that his staff was involved.[102] When reporter Matt Katz asked, \"Governor, did you have anything to do with these lane closures in September outside the GW Bridge? Have you spoken to--\"[281] Christie dismissively joked \"I worked the cones, actually, Matt. Unbeknownst to everybody I was actually the guy out there. I was in overalls and a hat. You really are not serious with that question.\"[282][283][284] \n \n Christie questioned the policy of allowing three dedicated lanes, saying \"I didn't know Fort Lee got three dedicated lanes until all this stuff happened, and I think we should review that entire policy. Because I don't know why Fort Lee needs three dedicated lanes to tell you the truth,\" and \"the fact that one town has three lanes dedicated to it? That kind of gets me sauced [upset].\"[285] However, members of the New Jersey Assembly Transportation Committee said at a November 25, 2013, hearing that the Fort Lee entrance has been used by an even greater number of commuters from the surrounding Bergen County towns. PA officials, including Patrick Foye, confirmed that assessment in their sworn testimony at the committee hearing on December 9, 2013.[37][113] \n \n Christie has denied involvement, saying that his staff acted without his knowledge regarding to the planning for the lane closures. He said at an April 2014 town hall meeting: \"if anybody told me they were going to do this, I would have stopped it\".[286] \n \n On December 12, 2013, The Wall Street Journal reported[287] that Christie was said to have called New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to complain about Patrick Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority and a Cuomo appointee, in an apparent attempt to shut down Foye's investigation of the lane closures.[288] On December 13, 2013, Christie denied such a call, saying, \"The story is categorically wrong. I did not have that conversation with Governor Cuomo in any way, shape or form.\"[290] In his January 9, 2014, press conference, he also denied any such conversation.[102] Heather Haddon of The Wall Street Journal still stood by the report on February 19,[291] and Matt Katz said that he had independently confirmed it.[292] During the federal trial of Baroni and Kelly, PA Commissioner Scott Rechler (appointed by Cuomo as vice-chairman under Samson) testified that Cuomo had told him that \"Governor Christie mentioned to [Cuomo] that David Samson was once again complaining about Pat Foye interfering, getting involved in politics.\"[293] \n \n At a press conference on December 13, Christie announced the immediate resignations of Baroni and Wildstein.[11][294] Nevertheless, Christie said the closure was \"absolutely, unequivocally not\" political retribution.[295] \n \n Christie added: \"I've made it very clear to everybody on my senior staff that if anyone had any knowledge about this, they needed to come forward to me and tell me about it. And they've all assured me that they don't.\"[296] Christie said: \"The chief of staff and chief counsel assured me they feel comfortable that we have all the information we need to have.\"[11] \n \n At that point during the December 13 press conference, Christina Genovese Renna texted to Pete Sheridan, \"Are you listening? He [Christie] just flat out lied about senior staff and [Bill] Stepien not being involved,\" and \"He lied. And if e-mails are found with the subpoena or [campaign] e-mails are uncovered in discovery if it come to that it could be bad.\" The texts from Renna (an employee of Kelly) to Sheridan (who had worked on the re-election campaign) came to light in court filings by Baroni's attorneys on August 10, 2016, to which Christie responded, \"I absolutely dispute it. It's ridiculous. It's nothing new.\"[297][298] At the federal trial, Renna walked back her comments, testifying, \"I had no knowledge of whether the governor was lying or not. But it seemed to contradict what I had been told.\"[299] \n \n In a nearly two-hour press conference on January 9, 2014, Christie apologized for the toll lane closures and said that he was \"embarrassed and humiliated\" by the behavior of his staff. Christie claimed he first learned of his staff's involvement via news media reports on January 8. The governor announced that he had fired Bridget Kelly, calling her \"deceitful\", claiming her lack of disclosure about her actions and e-mails caused him to mislead the public.[102][300] Christie admonished his two-time campaign manager Bill Stepien and said he had asked Stepien to withdraw his name from the Republican State Party Chairman race, and to cease his consulting role for the Republican Governors Association.[301] Christie promised that he and his staff would cooperate with any government investigations, including those by the New Jersey Legislature. When asked what he would do if subpoenaed to testify on the matter, Christie said, \"I'm not going to speculate on that\".[102] \n \n Christie said \"I have had no contact with David Wildstein in a long time, a long time, well before the election.\" Christie was re-elected Governor on November 5, 2013.[302] On September 11, 2013, during the third day of the closures, Christie, Wildstein, Samson and Baroni were photographed together at the site of the World Trade Center during a commemoration of the 12th anniversary of the terrorist attacks.[10] \n \n In the press conference, Christie described his earlier efforts to determine his staff's involvement, saying: \"I brought my senior staff together I think about four weeks ago tomorrow. And I put to all of them one simple challenge: If there is any information that you know about the decision to close these lanes in Fort Lee, you have one hour to tell either my chief of staff, Kevin O'Dowd, or my chief counsel, Charlie McKenna.\"[303] \n \n The governor's office issued a statement on January 31, 2014, that denied the allegations about Christie that were contained in a January 31 letter from Alan Zegas (Wildstein's attorney) to the PA, which had been made public. The letter questioned the accuracy of various statements made by Christie about his client, without providing any specific references, and claimed that there is evidence of Christie being aware of the toll lane closures at the time that they were closed. The governor's office said that Christie stood by his position that he \"first learned lanes were closed when it was reported by the press\".[304][305] Christie previously said in his December 13 press conference that this was well after the toll lanes for local traffic were reopened.[306] \n \n During his monthly talk radio broadcast on February 3, Christie said he was cooperating with subpoenas from the state legislative committee and the U.S. Attorney to his governor's office, which began turning over documents to the legislative committee earlier in the day and would continue to do so as the requested items were located.[307] \n \n On April 17, Christie enacted two recommendations of the Mastro report. He eliminated the Office of Legislative and Intergovernmental Affairs, which had been headed by Bridget Kelly. He named Patrick E. Hobbs, dean of Seton Hall University School of Law, Christie's alma mater, as a part-time ombudsman to address complaints about misconduct, enhance ethics training and accountability, and improve electronic communications in the governor's office. Critics noted that Christie's staff and others had used personal e-mails to avoid public scrutiny.[308] \n \n Hobbs retained his Seton Hall post.[308][309] Hobbs asserted that Christie had given him \"full authority and independence\" and would leave the job if he felt impeded. The United States Ombudsman Association recommends, however, that ombudsmen be appointed by entities outside of their jurisdiction, preferably by a legislature, to avoid any questions about independence.[309] In 2006, as U.S. Attorney, Christie approved Bristol-Myers Squibb's endowment of an ethics chair at Seton Hall's law school in a controversial prosecution settlement.[309][310] After a controversy arose over this agreement, Hobbs wrote a letter in 2006 to the editor of The Wall Street Journal praising Christie. Hobbs said he has had a 15-year professional relationship with Christie, and denied the Bristol-Meyers-Squibb arrangement would compromise his role as ombudsman.[310] \n \n On April 24, Christie denied creating a \"culture of divisiveness\" or that perceptions about his attitude may have led others to plan and allow the lane closures to occur as retaliation. \"If in fact I created a culture where people were going after each other, then how did we do all these things together with Republicans and Democrats?\" Christie asked during a Brick, New Jersey town hall meeting.[286][311] The Star-Ledger editorial board answered that Richard Nixon had cut deals with Democrats, but had still abused power; and that despite Christie's early bipartisanship, he has thrown himself into several partisan standoffs; and that his personal style had always been \"vindictive and aggressive\"; and concluded that Christie \"created the culture that inspired\" the lane closures.[312] \n \n After the May 2015 indictment of Baroni and Kelly and the Wildstein guilty plea, Christie said that the outcome of the federal investigation was a vindictation. He said on Twitter \"Today's charges make clear that what I've said from day one is true,\" and \"I had no knowledge or involvement in the planning or execution of this act.\"[16] \n \n Political impact [ edit ] \n \n New Jersey Democratic political leaders lambasted Christie and the lane closings. Sokolich called them \"a petty political vendetta,\"[313] while Barbara Buono contended that a culture of intimidation and retribution engendered by Christie and his staff hampered funding of a challenger even though the state was mostly Democratic.[314] The Democratic National Committee released a video in December 2013 that raised questions if \"Christie's political payback\" was behind the toll lane closures.[315] It released a satirical video, timed to coincide with the January Assembly hearing, about what questions still needed to be answered.[316] At the beginning of February, it released an online video ad with a Super Bowl 48-inspired, football game theme.[317][318] It was followed soon after by a video that parodied Facebook's popular \"Look Back\" videos.[319] \n \n Rudy Giuliani said that if Christie was \"not telling the truth, he's ruined.\" While Giuliani claimed that he was not acting as a surrogate for Christie, many of the media inquiries for interviews with Giuliani had gone to the governor's office and were forwarded to Giuliani by Maria Comella, Christie's Communications Director.[137][320] \n \n Former Republican New Jersey Governor Thomas Kean, a longtime mentor and supporter of Christie, said in January 2014 that he believed Christie when he said he did not know his aides were involved in the lane closures until incriminating e-mails were revealed on January 8. Kean said that there were still unanswered questions about the atmosphere in the governor's office and \"whether or not there are more than two or three people involved.\"[321] In an April 2014 interview with The New Yorker, Kean questioned whether Christie \"created an atmosphere in which some of those people thought they were doing his will because they were getting back at people.\" Kean said he had reconsidered his support of Christie as a potential presidential candidate, and that if Christie was not telling the truth, \"then he's finished. As governor, too.\"[322] \n \n Christie was not named in the May 2015 indictment, and the U.S. Attorney, Paul Fishman, refused to speak on the possible culpability of persons other than the three persons charged.[323] According to The New York Times, the indictment would have a negative political impact on Christie's possible presidential ambitions.[16] Iowa GOP donor Gary Kirke said that Christie's delay to announce a possible presidential campaign until after being cleared of wrongdoing, greatly reduced his chances of winning the 2016 Iowa caucuses. GOP operatives said that the scandal itself had not been an issue leading up to Iowa, nor to New Hampshire, where the first presidential primary would be held.[324] \n \n Public opinion [ edit ] \n \n National polls [ edit ] \n \n In January 2014, there was a wide range of opinion about the long-term impact of this scandal on a potential Christie 2016 presidential bid for the 2016 election.[19][325][326] By early February, national polling[17][18] showed a substantial erosion in his political standing and 2016 presidential campaign prospects.[20][327] \n \n A Quinnipiac poll, published January 21, showed him trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the leading potential Democratic contender, 46% to 38%, which was a downturn from two previous polls that showed Christie and Clinton about even, after Christie had gained considerably in the polls against her since March 2013. Peoples' view of his presidential capabilities went down with 35% agreeing and 36% disagreeing that he would make a good president. This was down from 49% agreeing to 31% disagreeing in a November poll. For those who had heard of the Bridgegate scandal, 50% said this scandal would hurt Christie's presidential hopes, and made 34% of those polled less likely to vote for him. His favorability rating declined to only 33% viewing him generally as favorable with 30% unfavorable. This was down from his highest rating of 47% favorable to 23% unfavorable in December 2013. The poll showed that he had gone from the leading potential Republican candidate in December to a statistical tie with three others.[328] \n \n New Jersey polls [ edit ] \n \n A Rasmussen poll of New Jersey residents, published January 10, 2014, showed that 56% believe Christie should resign \"if it is proven that he approved of retaliation against an elected official who refused to support him.\" Only 29% disagreed. A majority believed it was at least somewhat likely that Christie was aware that the September toll lane closures were retaliation for the mayor of Fort Lee's refusal to support his re-election.[329] \n \n A Rutgers-Eagleton poll, published January 24, 2014, showed that the Fort Lee scandal had hurt his standings among New Jersey residents. Christie's favorability rating, as governor, was shown to be 46%, down 22 points from just before his landslide re-election victory in November 2013, with 43% having an unfavorable view. While the majority of residents still approved his overall performance as governor, his 53% job approval was down 15 points from November. A majority, 56%, said that it was \"very unlikely\" or \"somewhat unlikely\" that Christie's top aides acted without his knowledge in the Fort Lee scandal. Only 20% said they fully believed Christie's explanation about this topic, while 42% did not believe his version at all and 33% only partially believed him.[330] \n \n A Monmouth University/Asbury Park Press poll, published February 24, 2014, showed Christie's job approval ratings in New Jersey at 50%, which was down 9% since January and 20% from 12 months prior. Other results showed 61% believed the governor was not completely honest about what he knew about the toll lane closures, and 50% (up from 34% in January) thought Christie was personally involved in the decision to close the toll lanes.[331][332] A similar poll, released on April 2, showed his approval ratings to be about the same, remaining 14 points lower than December, before the Bridgegate scandal broke. It reported that 62% said that Bridgegate and Hoboken's Sandy relief aid issues hurt his presidential prospects for 2016, up from 51% in January.[276] \n \n Media coverage [ edit ] \n \n The lane closure controversy has received substantial attention from the New York area and national media. The first story in the media about the lane closures, and the first to bring politics into the mix, was reported by The Record's John Cichowski in his Road Warrior column on September 13, 2013, that there was speculation that Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich was targeted \"either for failing to endorse Governor Christie's election bid or for pushing through a $500 million, 47-story high-rise housing development near the bridge, or for failing to support the Port's last toll hike.\"[73][79] \n \n On September 17, 2013, Ted Mann of The Wall Street Journal wrote a story about what could have possibly prompted the Port Authority to close toll lanes to local traffic without public notifications. Citing anonymous sources, he reported that \"the decision to close the traffic lanes caused tension\" since \"the lane closures came as a surprise to some high-ranking officials at the bi-state agency.\" He said that the toll lanes were reopened to local traffic based on an order from Executive Director Patrick Foye, \"who argued that the abrupt shift in traffic patterns caused a threat to public safety and should have been advertised to the public ahead of time.\"[333] \n \n A subsequent newspaper report by Mann, published on October 1, 2013, was the first to address the contents and quote some of the text from Foye's September 13, 2013, e-mail to PA officials. Foye's e-mail ordered the toll lanes to be reopened, while denouncing the closures as an \"abusive decision\" and pledging to investigate \"how PA process was wrongfully subverted and the public interest damaged\" without Foye's knowledge. The e-mail said that there were potential violations of state and federal laws. PA insiders disputed that there was a traffic study. All of this reinforced the reported rumors that the toll lanes might have been closed by political surrogates of Governor Chris Christie, a Republican, as an alleged act of political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich, a Democrat, for not endorsing Christie in his 2013 re-election campaign.[334] The Record, The Wall Street Journal, and other news media continued to investigate the matter in comprehensive reporting over the next few months, using sources and requests for public records. \n \n The New York Times covered the lane closure story on December 8, 2013.[335] \n \n The scandal broke in full on January 8, 2014, with an online story by Shawn Boburg of The Record[336][337] that Christie's deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly was involved in the planning of the toll lane closures. That revelation catapulted the story into a national political event. The Record continued with details of the dialogues in the troves of e-mails and texts supplied to the New Jersey Assembly Transportation Committee by David Wildstein. The Record described \"vindictive lane closures\" that were intended to cause massive traffic jams in Fort Lee. Related news with quotes from the e-mails and texts were subsequently published the same day in other news media.[41][126] During his January 9, 2014, press conference about the scandal, Governor Christie cited The Record as breaking the pivotal story on January 8.[102] \n \n MSNBC gave substantial coverage to the Bridgegate scandal, and the network's ratings reached their highest point since the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings when it covered Chris Christie's apologetic press conference on January 9, 2014.[338] MSNBC's intensive coverage was criticized by Christie, who was formerly close to MSNBC, calling it a \"partisan network\" that is \"almost gleeful in their efforts attacking\" him.[339] In February 2014, comedian Bill Maher also criticized MSNBC for its overextended coverage.[340] In response to Christie's criticisms of the intensive coverage by MSNBC and other media, Steve Kornacki noted in 2015 that coverage by the media primarily focused on the causes and effects of the bridge toll lane closures and the involvement of members of Christie's administration and his Port Authority appointees, David Wildstein and Bill Baroni, rather than Christie himself. Observing that Christie had ridiculed the media in 2013 for trying to implicate Wildstein and Baroni, Kornacki noted that by 2015, Wildstein had pleaded guilty to federal charges and Baroni was facing a federal indictment in connection with the scandal.[341] \n \n In a decision on July 2, 2014, Superior Court Judge P. J. Innes ruled in favor of the North Jersey Media Group, publisher of the newspaper The Record, that the state must partially comply with open records request and turn over some information it had previously refused to release regarding current and former state employees' written requests for the state to appoint them attorneys or pay their legal fees resulting from parallel criminal and legislative investigations into the lane closures, though not the names of the employees. The state must pay the media group's legal fees. The media group plans to appeal, to gain fuller disclosure of the documents.[342] \n \n The scandal and subsequent events have been extensively covered in Wikipedia.[343] \n \n See also [ edit ] \n \n References [ edit ] \n \n Coordinates: ||||| Enough probable cause exists for a citizen's official misconduct complaint against Gov. Chris Christie to move forward in connection with the governor's alleged failure to stop politically-motivated lane closures at the George Washington Bridge in 2013, a judge in Bergen County ruled Thursday. \n \n The complaint by Bill Brennan, a retired Teaneck firefighter and citizen activist, alleges that Christie knew of the closures while they were happening and should have halted them. He alleges that the governor's inaction constitutes second-degree official misconduct, a charge punishable by five to 10 years in prison. \n \n The lane closures caused significant traffic problems over a four-day span in Fort Lee and sparked a 16-month investigation that resulted in charges against two former members of Christie's inner circle, who are currently on trial in federal court in Newark. The trial is in its third week. \n \n \"I'm satisfied that there's probable cause to believe that an event of official misconduct was caused by Gov. Christie,\" Municipal Presiding Judge Roy McGeady said. \"I'm going to issue the summons.\" \n \n The governor's office vowed to \"immediately appeal\" the ruling. Christie's first appearance was scheduled for 9 a.m. on Oct. 24. \n \n \"This is a dishonorable complaint filed by a known serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system,\" Christie spokesman Brian Murray said. \"The simple fact is the governor had no knowledge of the lane realignments either before they happened or while they were happening. This matter has already been thoroughly investigated by three separate independent investigations.\" \n \n Brennan said he based the complaint on testimony from David Wildstein, a Christie appointee at the Port Authority who pleaded guilty to his role in the scandal. Wildstein is the government's key witness in its conspiracy and fraud case against William Baroni, who served as deputy executive director of the Port Authority, and Bridget Anne Kelly, who was the governor's deputy chief of staff. \n \n The latest on the Bridgegate trial \n \n Though Christie was never charged in connection with the lane closures, the scandal is seen as contributing to his failed bid for the Republican nomination for President. \n \n Wildstein has said in his testimony that he discussed the plot with multiple members of Christie's senior staff before and during the lane closures, which he said was political retribution against Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for not endorsing the governor in his reelection campaign. \n \n Wildstein also testified that Christie was told about the gridlock at a 9/11 memorial service, as the lanes remained closed in Fort Lee. Brennan says Christie had a legal obligation to stop the lane closures at that point. \n \n McGeady asked Brennan why he filed in Bergen County, not Mercer County, where the governor's office is located. Brennan said that it was because the lane closures took place in Fort Lee, which McGeady said was a satisfactory answer. \n \n \"It's been dumped in this court's lap so this court is going to deal with it,\" McGeady said. \n \n Craig Carpenito, an attorney at the law firm Alston & Bird who appeared on behalf of the governor, told McGeady that Brennan's claim was \"intentionally misleading\" and that the governor's knowledge of the lane closures had already been thoroughly investigated. \n \n The audience in McGeady's courtroom, mostly there for minor criminal violations, applauded after he ruled. \n \n \"Anything short of probable cause today would have been official misconduct on the part of the judge,\" said Brennan, a graduate of the Seton Hall University School of Law. \"The standard is low, the evidence is heavy.\" \n \n McGeady said the case would now go to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office, which would decide whether to bring an indictment against Christie. The prosecutor, Gurbir S. Grewal, a Christie appointee, would likely recuse himself, McGeady said. \n \n The Bergen County Prosecutor's Office declined to comment. \n \n In New Jersey's criminal code, a charge of official misconduct pertains mostly to public officials. \n \n \"You're someone who either exercised their official function, knowing that it's unauthorized,\" explained James Pomaco, a former prosecutor in Passaic County who's now a criminal defense attorney. \"Or you're someone who knowingly 'refrained from performing a duty which is imposed upon him by law or is clearly inherent in the nature of his office'.\" \n \n Pomaco said that \"from a prima facie standpoint, there's enough for a charge\" of official misconduct based on Wildstein's testimony that Christie was informed of the lane closures as they were occurring on Sept. 11, 2013. \n \n At the start of the Bridgegate scandal, some experts argued that state was better suited to prosecute the case overall because violations of state law were more apparent. \n \n Assemblyman John Wisniewski (D-Middlesex), who along with state Sen. Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen), co-chaired the legislative committee that looked into Bridgegate, said \"it was a very interesting development, certainly not something that I expected today.\" \n \n \"It is a black eye for the state of New Jersey to have a judge find probable cause that the governor's actions were malfeasance in office,\" Wisniewski said. \"Look, the testimony of David Wildstein corroborated a lot of the suspicions that the committee had during our process, that lot of people have statewide. It remains to be seen exactly what happens now that a finding of probable cause has been reached, because we know that the prosecutor has a discretion to act on that. We don't know exactly what they'll do.\" \n \n Weinberg said the Bridgegate panel may have to reconvene. \n \n \"I believe that there are people who came before the joint committee under oath and were not exactly forthcoming, which is the kindest way I can describe. There were texts apparently that they never told us about, there were meetings that they never offered,\" she said. \n \n Brennan unsuccessfully sued the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office in 2014 in an effort to reveal the names of bidders at an auction for baseball memorabilia seized in a drug arrest. He has filed numerous suits against public officials in Bergen County over the years. \n \n Staff Writers Craig McCarthy, Claude Brodesser-Akner and Samantha Marcus contributed to this story. \n \n Myles Ma may be reached at mma@njadvancemedia.com.

Prosecutors, as well as both defense attorneys, have made a point of showing at trial that Christie approved of the closures. \n \n Brennan alleges that Christie\u2019s failure to end the closures constitutes second-degree official misconduct, a charge punishable by five to 10 years in prison. \n \n Thursday\u2019s ruling now forwards Brennan\u2019s summons \u2014 which calls Bridgegate an \u201cintentional evil minded act\u201d \u2014 to Bergen County Prosecutor Gurbir S. Grewal, who will decide whether to charge the governor. \n \n But Grewal is a Christie appointee, and may wind up recusing himself in favor of an independent prosecutor. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with a government that turns its power against its citizens,\u201d Brennan told The Post, explaining the summons he originally filed in a Fort Lee municipal court. \n \n Christie spokesman Brian Murray dismissed the complaint and the ruling as \u201cdishonorable\u201d and \u201cfiled by a known serial complainant and political activist.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, in the federal trial, the government rested its case after 15 days and 18 witnesses. \n \n The government\u2019s final witness Thursday was FBI agent Michelle Pickels, who testified that she was unable to recover some of Kelly\u2019s emails, including the infamous \u201ctime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,\u201d from Kelly\u2019s Yahoo account, suggesting they were deleted. \n \n Baroni then began presenting his defense. \n \n His first witness was Christie\u2019s former general counsel Charlie McKenna, who doubled down on the notion that he believed the lane closures were part of a traffic study until emails suggesting otherwise emerged in Jan. 2014. \n \n McKenna claimed he didn\u2019t find it odd that New Jersey residents were kept in the dark about the lane closures, which slowed emergency vehicles in Fort Lee, because it was all done for the sake of science. \n \n \u201cIt would strike me from a common sense standpoint that if you gave notice to people that you are going to shift lanes they would act differently, and that would skew the results,\u201d McKenna said. \n \n McKenna was called to the stand because he participated in a conference call with Baroni in preparation for Baroni\u2019s Nov. 2013 testimony before a NJ legislative committee about the lane closures, which were drawing scrutiny. \n \n McKenna said that throughout the 10-minute call, Baroni referred to the closures as part of a traffic study \u2014 a since-debunked cover story. \n \n When asked whether the governor ever asked him to look into allegations surrounding the lane closures, he said yes. \n \n \u201cThe governor at one point asked me, \u2018What\u2019s going on with this situation,\u2019\u201d McKenna. \u201cI reported back to him that they were doing a traffic study and that I talked to Bill Baroni.\u201d \n \n He confirmed that he told Bridgegate mastermind David Wildstein that he was still a \u201cpart of the team\u201d after he fired him in Dec. 2013 because he still believed it was all a traffic study gone awry. \n \n \u201cHe was afraid he was going to be ostracized from the Christie administration. I said this is a bad situation. You are going to have to resign but you are still on the team.\u201d \n \n \u201cI meant the bigger Christie team. The governor wasn\u2019t upset with him \u2014 the people around the governor were,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cI believed it was a traffic study so there\u2019s nothing nefarious about a traffic study,\u201d McKenna said when asked why he didn\u2019t question Wildstein when he fired them in December 2013 over the lane closures. \n \n Asked outside of court whether his job as a public official was to ensure residents\u2019 safety or treat them as lab rats, McKenna said he was instructed by the judge not to comment. \n \n McKenna\u2019s testimony continues Friday, followed by a string of Baroni character witnesses, including Jose Rivera, a traffic engineer for the Port Authority.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 A citizen's official misconduct complaint against New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie can move forward, a judge in the state ruled Thursday. Bill Brennan, whom the Star-Ledger describes as a \"citizen activist\" and Christie's office describes as \"a known serial complainant and political activist with a history of abusing the judicial system,\" filed the complaint last month over the 2013 BridgeGate scandal. Per Brennan's complaint, Christie knew lane closures were happening and could have put a stop to the whole thing. The complaint is based on testimony from the trial against former Christie aide Bridget Anne Kelly and former Port Authority executive Bill Baroni. During the trial, a man Christie appointed to Port Authority testified that both he and Baroni told Christie about the lane closures during a 9/11 ceremony (the lanes were closed from Sept. 9 to Sept. 13, 2013). Now that the judge has ruled the complaint can move forward, it will go to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office so a decision can be made as to whether Christie should be indicted. Christie's office, which insists the governor had no knowledge of the lane closures while they were ongoing, said it would appeal the judge's ruling. The Star-Ledger reports that the courtroom audience, \"mostly there for minor criminal violations,\" applauded the judge's ruling. The judge issued a criminal summons for Christie, the New York Post reports.",

    "document": "Allegations by Los Angeles police that \"Shield\" actor Michael Jace shot his wife to death at their Hyde Park home Monday night shocked longtime neighbors who described the couple as loving and friendly, but it isn't the first time he's faced accusations of domestic violence. \n \n Law enforcement sources told the Los Angeles Times that Jace confessed to fatally shooting his wife, April, multiple times around 8:30 p.m. Monday at their home in the 5400 block of Brynhurst Avenue. April Jace, a well-liked financial aid employee at Biola University, had walked in the door just 10 to 15 minutes earlier after picking up the couple's sons from baseball practice. \n \n Los Angeles police said in a statement that the motive for the shooting \"is believed to be domestic violence\" \u2014 an accusation levied against Michael Jace nearly two decades ago when he divorced his previous wife, Jennifer Bitterman. \n \n In court documents she described one instance in which she said Michael Jace threatened to kill her if they went to \u201cwar\u201d over his visitation rights of their son. In the divorce filing, Bitterman painted a portrait of her husband as temperamental and unreliable. \n \n In another filing, a longtime friend of Bitterman's described a violent incident she said she witnessed between the couple. \n \n The woman told the court she was in the room when Michael Jace \u201cchoked and hit\u201d Bitterman and \u201cslammed her against the wall while [her son] screamed in his crib next to her.\u201d The child was 6 months old at the time. \n \n \"The Shield\" actor Michael Jace remains in custody after the fatal shooting of his wife. \"The Shield\" actor Michael Jace remains in custody after the fatal shooting of his wife.

SEE MORE VIDEOS \n \n That sentiment was shared by most neighbors, who said they often saw Jace walking his German Shephard named Max and his two children on the street. \n \n \"He's a very good dad who always played with his kids,\" said Brandon Cook, 35. \n \n But behind the giggles and dog walks, Michael Jace, 51, was under financial stress. \n \n The actor filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in March 2011, when he listed his liabilities at more than $500,000 against assets of $325,000, according to federal court records. \n \n At the time he was more than $22,000 in debt to the government, more than $16,000 in debt to credit card companies and still owed on two mortgages. \n \n Cook said Michael Jace struggled to find steady work after \"The Shield\" stopped airing a few years ago, and he noticed that the family downgraded to less expensive cars. \n \n \"It was apparent,\" Cook said. \n \n The actor appeared to have been keeping up with his payments until late last year, when one of his creditors filed a motion stating the actor had fallen behind by about $2,800, according to the federal court records. \n \n On Monday, Harding said she saw Michael Jace quickly pull his gray van into the driveway, leaving his front door ajar. \n \n Shortly after, as she was washing her car, she heard a popping noise. \n \n \"I wasn't sure if it was a gunshot, but then I heard two more popping noises and I ran into my house.\" \n \n Other neighbors reported hearing the couple arguing just before the shots rang out, KNBC-TV reported. \n \n Los Angeles police say the couple's two sons, both under 10, were home at the time of the shooting, but were physically unharmed. \n \n Michael Jace was standing in the doorway unarmed when police arrived. His wife's body was found in a hallway inside the home, police said. \n \n \n \n As police continued to investigate the pink stucco house Tuesday, neighbors were forced to confront two incredibly different narratives of the family they thought they knew. \n \n \"They were like the Huxtables on the block,\" Tonja Edwards, 42, said. That Michael Jace might have killed his wife \"in cold blood like that, really leaves us all puzzled,\" she added. \n \n The shooting also shocked Biola University, where April Jace was a well-liked financial aid worker. \n \n University President Barry H. Corey issued a statement Tuesday saying the La Mirada campus was \u201cobviously shocked and saddened by this terrible news, to lose a wonderful colleague, mother and friend.\u201d \n \n The couple's two sons were staying with family members as the investigation continued. In addition to the two sons she had with Michael Jace, April also had an older son from a previous relationship. \n \n \"I'm heartbroken,\" Cook said. \"My prayers go out to the family and for those kids because they don't have their mom or their dad anymore.\" ||||| Frederick M.

    "document": "A former Tesla process technician, Martin Tripp, is tweeting internal emails, photos and vehicle identification numbers that he says are evidence of flawed manufacturing practices at Tesla's battery factory, and of product sold by Tesla that is imperfect, and could put drivers' lives at risk. \n \n Tesla has characterized Tripp as a disgruntled ex-employee and saboteur in the past. \n \n Tripp, in previous interviews, said that Tesla's Gigafactory took dangerous manufacturing shortcuts, and that Elon Musk had direct knowledge of these but failed to intervene. \n \n The tweets were posted to Tripp's account Wednesday. However, Tripp took down his Twitter account by Thursday morning, his lawyer told CNBC. \n \n The lists of vehicle identification numbers, which he wrote in the tweets, refer to specific cars that received batteries containing damaged cells that never should have been installed. \n \n Tripp also tweeted pictures that he claims prove Tesla is storing waste or scrap in open parking lots and trucks at the Gigafactory, rather than temperature-controlled warehouses. He also shared screen shots of graphics that he says show a high volume of waste at the factory. ||||| Cristina Balan posing with the prototype of an electrochromatic windshield she designed and showed to Elon Musk in 2014. Business Insider \n \n In early August, a former Tesla process technician, Martin Tripp, countersued the company. \n \n Tripp claims that Tesla, which filed a lawsuit against him in June, falsely accused him of hacking into the company's operating system. He also alleges Tesla waged a smear campaign against him in order to silence his claims of poor part quality and waste at the company. \n \n For another former Tesla employee, Cristina Balan, Tripp's story feels familiar. \n \n Balan began working for Tesla as an engineer in 2010. In a series of interviews with Business Insider, Balan said she was pushed out of Tesla four years later. \n \n Balan says this happened shortly after she and her seven-member interior-design team shared concerns with their superiors about poor part quality and waste they observed on the job. Balan sued Tesla alleging discrimination, retaliation, and other issues. A multiyear arbitration ensued. \n \n Business Insider reviewed emails, testimonies, text messages, and other information from Balan's tangle with Tesla. \n \n Here's how a once celebrated Tesla engineer \u2014 who used to work on top-secret projects for Tesla's top brass and whose initials were actually carved onto the battery of the Model S \u2014 says she wound up on the wrong side of the company. \n \n It could be a cautionary tale for what Tripp is about to face. \n \n If you are a Tesla employee or customer who has a story to share about a car or experience with the company, give me a shout at llopez@businessinsider.com. \n \n A Saturday venting session spirals: 'I feel like a sheep in a slaughterhouse' \n \n In March 2014, Balan and her interiors team had brewing concerns about Tesla. \n \n They worried about design flaws in the cars and felt their concerns were being overlooked or mishandled by managers. \n \n According to internal emails and testimony from the arbitration, Balan's team had every intention of taking its issues straight to Tesla's CEO, Elon Musk. \n \n Musk had, after all, told employees that Tesla was not a hierarchical company. They should feel free to approach him whenever they deemed it necessary. \n \n Before she scheduled a meeting with Musk though, Balan reached out to one of the heads of her department, Chris Porritt, who was Tesla's vice president of vehicle engineering. Porritt asked to meet with Balan and the team about their concerns. \n \n Business Insider \n \n The team met with him on a Saturday for about two hours. \n \n There, they described an aggressive, high-pressure atmosphere, as well as a version of business as usual at Tesla that was full of part defects, opaque relationships with suppliers, and waste. \n \n The engineers said they felt frustrated because they believed their immediate bosses might have been shielding them from contacting suppliers, making it difficult for the interiors team to finish projects thoroughly and correct design flaws. \n \n Balan said she suspected this bottleneck was really just a way for her bosses to hide mistakes. For instance, her concern about a so-called rat hole \u2014 a gap she had found in the design of the Model S's roof headliner that separated the roof from the rest of the car \u2014 had been met with what Balan saw as clear resistance from her managers. \n \n Tesla, she claimed, ultimately stuffed a piece of Styrofoam in the gap of the $100,000 car to fix it. And while the DIY-sounding solution didn't present a safety issue, Balan said it created a rattling noise in some of the vehicles that customers later complained about. \n \n Where the \"rat hole\" would be, according to Balan. Business Insider At the Saturday meeting, members of the group shared instances when they felt their attempts to fix faulty Tesla car parts were thwarted by management. \n \n One engineer said he had wanted to fix a problem with the Model S's driver's seat floor mat since 2012. As designed, the floor mat could interfere with the brake, the engineer claimed. \n \n But he said that when he tried to investigate the issue with the supplier, his managers stopped him and either demanded to take over or asked him to focus on something else. \n \n The engineer told the group that the still unfixed floor mats were a safety issue, even as Tesla had tens of thousands of cars on the road. Porritt agreed. Porritt also lamented that the company might have to scrap $90,000 worth of defective parts. \n \n Tesla ignored repeated requests for comment on this exchange. \n \n Porritt agreed with just about everything the team said during that long Saturday meeting. He listened when the employees complained about what they said was bullying by managers. He thanked them for meeting and said that what was happening on their team was certainly not \"the Tesla way.\" He also said the team could trust him, and he promised to help find a solution. \n \n Instead, in the following days, the team members were pulled into meetings with their bosses and pressured to recant their statements, according to text messages, emails, and arbitration documents seen by Business Insider. \n \n \"I feel like a sheep in a slaughterhouse,\" one engineer wrote in a text to teammates. \n \n Another engineer who attended the meeting later testified that he felt pressured to deny his attendance at the meeting with Porritt and any complaints about the team's superiors. He said he felt that if he didn't, he might lose his job, and he claimed the rest of the team felt the same way. \n \n Balan's final days \n \n Tesla handled Balan differently from her colleagues. \n \n In emails dated April 2, 2014, her managers and a member of Tesla's human-resources team discussed how to deal with her going forward, and, according to emails viewed by Business Insider, they did not see much of a future for her at Tesla. \n \n Balan understood she had become an increasing headache to her immediate superiors she constantly clashed with, so superiors and HR discussed a plan to either coach her or determine other paths for her, according to an email. \n \n They decided to check in with Balan about her health rather than any work-performance issues; she had expressed concern about it to a superior months before and had health issues during her first stint at Tesla. Then they would decide the best way forward, according to their correspondence. \n \n \"If for any reason we are unable to substantiate the health issue, we will need to then set a different plan of action,\" Tesla's HR wrote in the email to Balan's managers and Porritt. \n \n Tesla ignored repeated requests for comment on this email exchange. \n \n Balan ultimately left Tesla on April 16, 2014, less than a week after Tesla's counsel told her via email that she was the only person on her team who \"accused\" her managers \"of wasteful spending and the covering up of that wasteful spending.\" \n \n \"You were the only one who made the accusation to Chris,\" Tesla's counsel said in an email. \"You were the only one who made such an accusation to HR. Thus there is no reason for me to speak to the others who complained to Chris.\" \n \n Balan said it felt as though Tesla wanted to go on as if the Saturday meeting with Porritt never happened and none of her colleagues had ever spoken up at the company. \n \n Electric culture shock \n \n In the arbitration that followed Balan's departure, Tesla claimed that Balan resigned in 2014 because she didn't get along with her bosses and couldn't get work done. \n \n Tesla's lawyers argued that she complained often and was concerned with only her own designs. \n \n A former colleague familiar with the situation who felt Balan was a \"creative,\" capable engineer also said she was overly excitable and too intense. \n \n But Balan maintains a belief that her resignation was prompted by a campaign to \"push\" her out of Tesla after she and her team complained about quality issues with cars. \n \n Balan said she believes that even in the subsequent arbitration, Tesla found ways to continue to discredit and silence her. \n \n Balan recorded conversations with her colleagues while at Tesla, but the former San Francisco Superior Court judge who presided over the arbitration would not allow any to be used in the case. \n \n The arbitrator found that Tesla underpaid Balan by misclassifying her as an employee below her talent level. But he did not find that there had been any gender discrimination or that Balan was a whistleblower. \n \n The defects she was concerned about, like the \"rat hole,\" were simply not a safety risk to the arbitrator, and Tesla's witnesses also denied that the defects were severe. \n \n Balan said she was offered to settle with Tesla \"seven or eight times\" and the money would have allowed her to stop working for at least a decade. But Tesla wanted Balan to sign away her right to speak about her experience, and she found that troubling, so she never agreed. \n \n \"We are living in an era of autonomous driving and artificial intelligence,\" Balan told Business Insider. \"We cannot afford to have engineers on that level being afraid to speak up\" when they see mistakes, she added. \"We cannot afford this.\" \n \n 2 Teslas. Same Tripp. \n \n To Balan, her story is a tale of two Teslas. \n \n During her first stint at the company, Balan worked in the battery department. There, she said, everything was about pushing creativity and innovation and saving every penny the fledgling company could find. \n \n But her experience on the interiors team felt different. \n \n \"As soon as the Model S came out the door and Elon realized how cool he'd become, everything went down the drain,\" she said. \n \n She said she felt Tesla went from a scrappy startup with high integrity to one engulfed by Silicon Valley hype. \n \n When a company becomes the hot company to work for and rich with funding, the type of people who flock to work there can change. Priorities sometimes change. And culture can change too. \n \n \"The reason Tesla is what it is is because it transformed from a company of innovation to a company of sales,\" Balan said. \"The only thing they care about is how many cars they come up with per week. It doesn't matter what the quality is.\" \n \n This opinion is perhaps why Balan saw so much of her story in Tripp, the former technician countersuing Tesla. \n \n Like Balan, Tripp is trying to claim whistleblower status after he pointed out perceived issues with Tesla's production process to Business Insider. \n \n He claims in his filing that the quality of Tesla's battery manufacturing is low \u2014 to the point of being dangerous \u2014 and that he fears batteries could overheat and go into what's known as thermal runaway. He also claims that Tesla's production process is so wasteful that it's not living up to its environmental mission. \n \n Also, like Balan, he claims that now the company is trying to intimidate him into silence. \n \n \"I think they are just too full of themselves,\" Balan said of Tripp's situation. \"They think Tesla can get away with everything.

On Wednesday evening, Tripp began tweeting out details and photos about his time at Tesla and found himself suspended faster than you can say, \u201cInfowars was an inside job.\u201d \n \n A former technician for the electric vehicle company, Tripp was fired by Tesla earlier this year and he was accused by Elon Musk of being a \u201csaboteur.\u201d A subsequent lawsuit filed by the company accused Tripp of hacking into \u201cthe company\u2019s confidential and trade secret information and transferred that information to third parties,\u201d and giving false information to media outlets. Tripp took his claims to the SEC and filed a whistleblower tip. He then filed a $1 million defamation lawsuit against Tesla. There\u2019s a lot of bad blood between these two parties. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Earlier tonight, Tripp took to his personal Twitter and began posting photos that he claims help back up some of the assertions that Tesla has denied. \u201cAre you ready,\u201d he asked his followers and proceeded to upload photos of what he claimed to be improperly handled cooling tubes, proof of damaged battery cells being reworked and installed in cars that were sold, and graphics about a high volume of scrap waste. Tripp made many other allegations but what might be his most jaw-dropping disclosure was a listing of Teslas that he claims were sold with \u201cpunctured / dented / damaged\u201d batteries. \n \n \n \n If you\u2019re a Tesla owner, you might want to make your way here, here, here, and here to check out the VIN numbers of models that are allegedly carrying hazardous batteries. \n \n Advertisement \n \n But not all of Tripp\u2019s tweets are still on his page. He told Gizmodo that he\u2019s been slapped with a twelve-hour suspension by Twitter and some tweets were deleted. In a direct message (he can still use DMs) he told us that he believes it was because at least one photo contained \u201can email [address] with Elon\u2019s name.\u201d We can confirm that one photo did appear to show what may be Elon Musk\u2019s email address. Tripp showed us a screenshot of the notification Twitter sent him, and it does list the reason for his temporary suspension as violating its policies against posting private information: \u201cYou may not publish or post other people\u2019s private information without their express authorization and permission.\u201d \n \n Here\u2019s the image that contained Musk\u2019s name beside an email address with the address redacted: \n \n Screenshot: Martin Tripp \n \n Advertisement \n \n Whatever the veracity of Tripp\u2019s claims, you have to give him credit for just laying his case out there for all to see. We contacted Tesla for comment and a spokesperson told us: \n \n As we\u2019ve said before, these claims are false and Mr. Tripp does not even have personal knowledge about the safety claims that he is making. No punctured cells have ever been used in any Model 3 vehicles in any way, and all VINs that have been identified have safe batteries. Notably, there have been zero battery safety issues in any Model 3. \n \n Tripp also finds himself as an example of how quickly Twitter is capable of responding to a violation of its policies while the social networks CEO is doing publicity 24/7 to explain how hard it was to suspend Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist host of Infowars who is being sued for claiming the Sandy Hook school shooting was a hoax and inspiring his followers to harass and dox the victims\u2019 families. When asked for comment on this story, Twitter did not immediately reply. \n \n Advertisement \n \n It definitely appears that Tripp violated Twitter\u2019s terms, and the fact that the company responded in a matter of a couple of hours sets a new gold standard for which we should all hold the company accountable. We\u2019re more than curious to find out if its capable of evaluating violations so quickly when the personal information belongs to someone who\u2019s not a billionaire. \n \n [ht Lora Kolodny/CNBC]",

Friday morning Ladue school officials said if a junior does not make the varsity team, the boy cannot play again on the junior varsity team. The school said this is to allow lower grade students a chance to develop their skills so that they will be prepared to try out for varsity. \n \n The mother of a Ladue junior who did not make the varsity cut does not think that\u2019s fair.

He said the reason he said nice things about John Doe was to build his self-esteem and not punch him in the gut after being cut from the varsity team. \n \n The lawyer for John Doe also introduced documents that he said show players performance ratings given by coaches show that John Doe is better than some of the boys who made varsity. \n \n Also in courtroom testimony, it was revealed that Ladue does not have a policy keeping juniors from playing J.V. sports.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 After her 16-year-old son failed to make the varsity soccer team, a disappointed mother went a step or two further than most parents might. She filed a lawsuit in federal court, alleging that the teen is a victim of age and gender discrimination, Fox 2 reports. The family says the rules at Missouri's Ladue High School state that if a junior doesn't make it onto the varsity team, he can't play again on the junior varsity team; that way, students in lower grades can use the JV team to develop the skills they need to try out for varsity. The family wants the boy placed on the JV team, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. They first appealed the coach's decision to district administrators and the superintendent, both of whom sided with the coach; they then complained to the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, but ultimately sued because the office had no power to force the school to place the boy on a team. The boy reportedly wanted to take the case to federal court. The family's lawsuit claims that the girls' soccer team does allow juniors to play on JV, which is where the sex discrimination comes in. \"There are many schools across the country that have this policy that you either make varsity as a junior or you're out of the program,\" says the boy's stepfather, who is also one of the lawyers handling the case. \"If someone said 'Cut all the blacks,' that would be illegal. And it's illegal for age too.\" He adds that per stats and rankings, the boy should have made varsity. But the coach testified in court that the only reason he said positive things about the boy's skills was to build up his self-esteem rather than making him feel worse after he had already failed to make the team, and he also testified that the school doesn't actually have a policy preventing juniors from playing on JV teams. He said it depends how many spots there are on the team and how many kids want to play. The judge is set to decide Monday.",

    "document": "\n \n Simon Dawson/Bloomberg \n \n Greece is heading toward a major vote Sunday that will both shape the future of its economy and Europe's monetary union. It is a complicated story, and here at Wonkblog, we've tried to give you a clear sense of what's going on and what's next. \n \n But Anil Kashyap of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business has released an excellent primer of his own that's worth a read. Kashyap wrote the piece last weekend, before Greece officially defaulted June 29 on a key payment to the International Monetary Fund, and the situation continues to evolve into the weekend. In an e-mail, Kashyap notes a few other important developments since his primer came out, including that some Greek officials have pledged to resign if Greeks vote Yes on the referendum; that creditors won't negotiate anymore until after the vote; and that a new IMF debt analysis sheds additional light on the grave situation facing Greece. \n \n Read over the primer's 18 questions and answers--reprinted here--and come away far more knowledgeable about Greece's crisis. (We have lightly edited a few points, marked with *, to reflect updates since the original version was published.) \n \n 1) How did Greece get into such trouble? \n \n Greece from the mid-1990s until last year was constantly spending more than it was collecting in tax revenues. For most of this time, the country\u2019s initially reported numbers showed small differences that were subsequently found to have been much larger. The revisions tended to be most substantial right after elections when a new government would find that its predecessor was much more profligate than had been reported. Because of these deficits, the country borrowed to cover the shortfalls and its debt burden was steadily rising. \n \n In the fall of 2009, a then newly elected government reported that the deficit for that year was going to be 13.6 percent of economic output and that the deficits in 2007 and 2006 were also larger than had been reported. From that point onward, the world began to wonder if Greece really could pay the debt that it had issued or needed to default. Its borrowing costs rose sharply and the country began looking for ways to reduce its required debt payments and end its borrowing addiction. \n \n 2) Wasn\u2019t Greece already bailed out in 2010? \n \n By the spring of 2010 the excessive debt problem became unbearable and there was open speculation that Greece would default. The country had done this on four occasions previously since 1800. Much of the government debt was owed to banks outside of Greece, with the largest amounts in France and Germany. So if Greece had stopped paying, the French and German banks would have suffered substantial losses. \n \n Greece was lent new money in 2010, but as Karl Otto Pohl, former head of the German central bank observed, at the time much of that money was used to repay the obligations owned by the French and German banks. The new lending was advertised by the politicians across Europe as a rescue for Greece. But it was at least as much a deal to buy time for the banks and other owners of Greek debt to avoid a default. Greece did avoid default, but the support came with requirements designed to make sure that the country end its chronic deficit spending. \n \n 3) Why did that rescue fail? \n \n To justify the new lending, the lenders had to be assured that the deficits would end and that the country would grow enough to be able to service its debt. In May of 2010, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), led at the time by Dominique Strauss Kahn, who had ambitions of running for the presidency of France, conducted an analysis to see if such a scenario was realistic. The report at the time concluded that if Greece undertook drastic reforms it could close its deficits and begin growing so that over time the debt (including the new lending that was being provided) would be manageable. \n \n This analysis was later shown to be deeply flawed by the IMF itself. The Greeks did actually cut their deficits substantially, but many of the reforms that were supposed to support growth did not occur and the economy contracted substantially. So the debt, relative to the size of the economy, did not improve. Importantly, no debt was written off in 2010, even though many analysts, including some on the executive Board of the IMF, at the time believed that it was necessary and that the banks and other private sector owners of the debt should have taken some losses. \n \n 4) What is the troika (or the institutions) and what do they have to do with this? \n \n The new lending in 2010 came from two sources, a fund that was raised from European governments and the IMF. The bailout fund was overseen by the finance ministers of these governments. The European Central Bank also provided support to Greece in two ways. First, it allowed banks in Greece (and everywhere else) to borrow from it by posting bonds guaranteed by Greece as the collateral. Second, it bought some Greek government bonds in the open market. So all three of these organizations were now exposed to losses in the event that Greece ever defaulted. As such, they had representatives that met regularly with the Greek government to make sure that the reforms were on track. Initially the three were called the troika. Subsequently, they have also been referred to as \u201cthe institutions.\" \n \n 5) Wasn\u2019t Greece also bailed out in 2012? \n \n By late 2010 it was already clear that the debt burden might prove to be unsustainable. So discussions began over reducing the debt. The Greek government was supposed to sell some assets to retire some of the debt. That never happened and as the recession continued it was clear that the 2010 plan was not going to be adequate. So in March 2012 a second bailout program with revised terms was undertaken. \n \n The IMF lent additional money, but the main conditions that accompanied the funding were largely the same. Once again, the cornerstones of the plan continued to be steps to make tax collection more efficient, to reduce spending promises, and to undertake reforms to encourage hiring and business expansion that would support growth. It was not clear why this plan would be more successful than the first one. \n \n The European Central Bank meanwhile became more deeply committed to stabilizing financial markets. ECB President Mario Draghi famously said in July 2012 that \u201cwithin our mandate, the ECB is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough.\u201d Draghi\u2019s statement immediately led to a drop in borrowing costs for governments across Europe and the pressure on Greece temporarily subsided. \n \n By continuing to allow banks everywhere to use Greek debt as collateral, the ECB also created conditions that supported the trading of Greek debt. By this time the French and German banks had shed their exposure to Greece so that they would no longer be directly harmed if there was a default. So the stealth rescue of the non-Greek banks was completed with little public attention and the narrative that all the problems were self-inflicted by the Greeks became more pronounced. \n \n 6) Why is Greece in trouble again now? \n \n In the time since Draghi\u2019s statement three important things happened in Greece. First, Greece made further substantial progress on closing its deficits. By late 2014, Greece was finally spending less than it was collecting, although the interest payments on debt meant there was still an overall deficit. So for the first time since Greece adopted the euro it had budget position that was solid. \n \n Second, the economy contracted for two more years as the reforms failed to deliver higher growth. Certainly the higher tax collections and reduced government spending contributed to the weak performance, but the degree to which the planned reforms, if fully implemented, could \n \n have offset that remains controversial. It is important to also recognize the massive collapse was \n \n preceded by a very large debt-fueled boom. \n \n Austerity notwithstanding, the economy seemed to have reached bottom and was finally beginning to recover in late 2014. A very interesting counterfactual scenario is to contemplate what would have happened if the political situation had allowed this progress to continue. \n \n The third major development, however, was that the public lost confidence in the incumbent government and its lenders. Unemployment in Greece has remained above 25 percent for years and \n \n was much higher for young people. So the citizens were fed up. Hence, in 2015 the public voted \n \n for a new government that insisted on deviating from the past playbook. \n \n The major party in the new coalition, Syriza, is often referred to a coalition of the radical left. In January 2015, newly elected Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras sought to reopen negotiations with Greece\u2019s creditors. \n \n 7) What is the Greek government asking for? \n \n The Tsipras government wanted three types of changes. First, it wanted to restore some of the spending cuts that had been enacted. Second, it wanted to reverse some of the revenue hikes that the past governments had instituted. These first two requests would have widened the deficit and also reorganized priorities within the budget. (In fact, once it became clear that Syriza was going to win the election, tax revenues began shrinking as the public stopped paying some unpopular taxes). \n \n Finally, it wanted outright forgiveness of some of the debt that had accumulated. \n \n Since taking office, Tsipras has been negotiating with the creditors over for a new set of agreements. The creditors have made some modest concessions but are largely insisting on a continuation of similar plans. \n \n When he failed to secure these changes, Tsipras announced that he would have the Greek people vote on a referendum on July 6 over whether Greece would vote yes to accept the creditors latest offer or vote no to reject it. \n \n 8) Why do the institutions disagree with the government?* \n \n There are two sources of objections that the creditors have with Tsipras\u2019 requests. \n \n First, and probably most importantly, countries such as Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Ireland, had all had to undertake similar types of adjustment as in Greece. None of them saw their economies collapse to the extent of Greece, but unemployment especially among the young is also high in all these countries. Hence, if there are substantial concessions to Greece, then these countries will insist upon getting similar treatment. The existing governments in these countries all realize that if electing a radical government in Greece is seen as being rewarded, then voters elsewhere will do the same. \n \n The money needed to save Greece could easily be found. Greece is a small economy, so even though their debt is large when judged relative to Greece\u2019s economy, it is small relative to the overall capacity in Europe. In contrast, the money needed to forgive debt in the other countries, especially Italy and Spain, is not affordable for Germany (and all the other Northern European countries that would have to foot the bill). \n \n Second, even if there was some way that Greece could be helped without setting a precedent, the officials do not trust the Greeks to carry through with any plans. The fact that Prime Minister Tsipras is asking for a public referendum to accept a continuation of prior policies was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back. Tsipras is arguing that the public should reject the plans. The institutions doubt that he could reverse his position and suddenly begin taking steps which he has campaigned against for years. They also are infuriated that he believes his mandate to get better terms supersedes the ones that other elected governments had from their citizens that wanted no more bailouts. \n \n Another consideration is that IMF, the ECB and the other European leaders believe that unlike before, if Greece defaults the spillovers can be managed. \n \n 9) Why was the IMF loan that came due June 29 so important?* \n \n The IMF made loans in 2010 to Greece that no private lender would have been willing to make. It did so with the presumption that it would be first in line to be repaid subsequently. \n \n For failing businesses in many countries, there is analogous arrangement where in a bankruptcy situation a judge can decide that a business is worth more if it can continue to operate with some new funding, than if it was closed and sold off immediately. In that case, the new funding gets highest priority for repayment (otherwise no one will lend) and a judge will make sure that is the case. For countries, enforcing this priority is a problem since there is no court or other authority that can compel a country to pay. \n \n Greece did not pay the IMF the \u20ac1.55 billion that it was owed on Tuesday. Now that it has defaulted, Greece has become an international pariah. To preserve its own ability to operate in future crises, the IMF must insist on being repaid. If it ever accepts the idea that a country can default if things go south, then it will never get repaid in the future. So the IMF will continue to seek repayment, no matter how flawed the analysis that led to the lending in the first place. \n \n Interestingly, Greece did make a small payment to the European bailout fund, so it will not be in default to that lender even if it does fall behind with the IMF. \n \n 10) What did the ECB decide last weekend and why did Greece close its banks?* \n \n The ECB decided it could no longer keep accepting additional collateral from the Greek banks that was guaranteed by the Greek government. This means no more extraordinary lending will be extended. The ECB was worried that Greece might not honor the obligations and hence it could be left with collateral that would be insufficient to cover the loans it extended already. This is in keeping with Draghi\u2019s promise of staying within the ECB mandate; lending when losses are expected would be clearly illegal. \n \n However, the ECB has not completely cut off its support to Greece. The ECB could have recalled all of its loans, or demanded even more collateral for the existing loans. But for the Greek banks this removed the only viable option for obtaining more cash. They do not have assets that they can sell to come up with more cash. So without the ECB\u2019s full support, they are in serious trouble. \n \n Greece has closed the banks so that depositors cannot take out all of their money. There are now limits on how much depositors can get from ATMs and limits on wire transfers. So depositors are nervous and scared about what is going to happen. \n \n 11) What can Greece do to save its economy now? \n \n Greece must either find a new lender, which seems very unlikely, or survive with very little credit for a while; Russia will not step in to offer support, since doing so would likely wind up with some of the resources transferred to other creditors and Russia has its own big fiscal problems. \n \n If there is a no vote, Greece will likely stop payments on all debt. Being cut off from credit markets, it will now be forced to match its spending to the revenue it is receiving. To ease the burden, the government will likely distribute IOUs of some form to government employees, vendors and pensioners. It may even have to use IOUs to fund the referendum. \n \n These IOUs will likely circulate as a form of money alongside the euro. People will strongly prefer euros to the IOUs, so the IOUs will trade at a discount. \n \n Some people and businesses may resort to bartering. \n \n 12) Why not just bring back the drachma? \n \n The public will have little confidence in the IOUs that the government issues. Probably even \n \n less confidence if Greece opts to officially introduce a new currency. Reintroducing the drachma would be totally illegal under European law and form the basis for a law suit to force Greece out of the European Union (EU). As part of the EU, Greek citizens can travel freely and work anywhere within Europe. Greek goods are also allowed to be sold without being subject to tariffs. Expulsion from the EU would be devastating. \n \n Issuing IOUs which are not officially touted as a currency is a better option for Greece for now. \n \n 13) Will the Greek crisis spread? \n \n It depends largely on what citizens make of the impending chaos in Greece. If people believe that their governments also might default on debt, they could also try to get money out of the banks. Likewise, investors could refuse to buy newly issued debt. \n \n The ECB is likely to be able to head off both these problems. It is already buying debt and can do more of that. It also can lend against the collateral guaranteed by these governments. The ECB can probably contain the immediate fallout. \n \n The political contagion is much harder to assess. Perhaps if Greece emerges in better shape in the medium term, then other countries will follow. Tsipras was betting that this concern would be so powerful that Europe would never take this risk. \n \n 14) What is likely to happen next in Greece? \n \n The outcome of the referendum now becomes critical. If the public votes \u201cyes,\" then perhaps the existing government (likely reorganized) will be able to reopen the banks and conclude a deal. \n \n But, if the public sides with Tsipras government, then there will be a very sharp recession over the next few months. Tax collection is likely to collapse. The Tsipras government is unlikely to survive the economic collapse. \n \n If the post-Tsipras government opts to proceed with the default, then the next big unknown is how long before the economy stabilizes. At some point Greece will be a very attractive tourist destination, and its goods that are no longer priced in euros will be more competitive, so at some point the economy will begin to turn around. Whether this takes months or quarters will depend on many decisions that are difficult to forecast now. \n \n 15) What happens to the IMF if its loan is not repaid? \n \n It will continue to pursue its claim against Greece. Greece will not be able to borrow internationally until it makes peace with the IMF. So the IMF will eventually be repaid. This could take years. \n \n The IMF is likely to be criticized further for the recommendations it made, particularly in 2010. Perhaps it will be reformed to limit its discretion in lending. \n \n Traditionally the head of the IMF has been a European. That is very likely to change since many countries believe that Greece was treated preferentially because it was a European country. \n \n 16) What happens to the ECB if Greece defaults? \n \n The loans made to Greece are extended by the Greek central bank, which in turn borrows from \n \n the ECB. So the ECB will have a large claim against the Greek central bank that is likely to turn into a significant loss. \n \n 17) Can the ECB survive if Greece defaults? \n \n The ECB can definitely continue even if Greece defaults. The ECB has provisions set aside to cover some losses. It also is making lots of profits on the bonds it owns (that it pays for with money that pays no interest). So the Greek losses per se are not a problem. \n \n A default by a larger country such as Italy or Spain would be very different. \n \n 18) What should have been done to avert this crisis?* \n \n Greece should have defaulted in 2010. Its debt burden then was unsustainable and nothing since then has changed this. It is true that financial markets were much more jittery at that time, but the money that was raised to pay off the creditors in that bailout could have been diverted to support Greece and other weak countries. Once the bad rescue of 2010 was undertaken, it was inevitable that some form of debt relief was going to be necessary. \n \n Imagine how different the political dynamics in Europe would have been if the German and \n \n French banks had been explicitly bailed out. \n \n (Editor's note: Not everyone agrees with this perspective, and many policymakers would argue Europe could not allow a default during such a fragile time in the markets. But it's a worthwhile perspective to consider, given where we are now.) ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption \"Nobody has the right to threaten to cut down Greece from its natural geographic body\" - Alexis Tsipras \n \n Greek PM Alexis Tsipras has called on voters to reject \"blackmail\" when they vote in a bailout referendum on Sunday. \n \n In a TV address, he insisted Greece's EU membership was not at stake. He later told cheering supporters to vote \"No\" to \"live with dignity in Europe\". \n \n There were scuffles with police as both sides held rallies in Athens. \n \n A Greek court has rejected a challenge to the legality of the referendum, in which people will vote on the terms of further international loans. \n \n It comes after tough talks with creditors, and EU leaders have warned that a \"No\" vote could see Greece leave the eurozone. \n \n Greece's economy is already being squeezed after its bailout programme ran out on Tuesday. \n \n Banks have been shut and limits imposed on cash withdrawals. \n \n The head of Greece's banking association has warned that although the banks have enough funds until Monday, they will be dependent on the European Central Bank thereafter. \n \n Desperate times \n \n Image copyright AFP/Getty Images \n \n It is a scene that speaks of suffering and exhaustion, and one that may well become the lasting image of the Greek debt crisis. \n \n An elderly man, sitting on the ground outside a bank, was photographed crying on Friday morning. \n \n The image, taken in Thessaloniki by AFP's Sakis Mitrolidis, was widely shared on social media as soon as it was published. \n \n The man, whose name was not disclosed, was helped away soon after it was taken. \n \n His story is not known, but those of plenty of other pensioners are. \n \n Monthly pensions have gone down to an average of \u20ac833 ($924; \u00a3594) from an average of \u20ac1,350 in 2009, according to INE-GSEE, the institute behind Greece's biggest union. \n \n Read more: Cost of crisis to pensioners \n \n Claims by Greek politicians that a \"No\" vote will strengthen their hand in bailout negotiations have been rebuffed by European leaders. \n \n Both EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Jeroen Dijsselbloem - head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers - have insisted a \"No\" vote will weaken the Greeks' position and that even a \"Yes\" vote will not mean a deal is easy to agree. \n \n Several European officials have complained in strong terms about Greece's abrupt decision to hold a referendum on the terms of a bailout offer that they say is no longer on the table. \n \n But in a ruling on Friday, Greece's top administrative court rejected an appeal lodged by two individuals who had argued that it was illegal to hold popular votes on fiscal matters. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Stefanaki Ioanna: \"A yes vote will give Greece a chance\" \n \n Debt 'unsustainable' \n \n Thousands of \"Yes\" and \"No\" supporters gathered in separate squares of central Athens on Friday, and police threw stun grenades in brief scuffles with \"No\" protesters. \n \n Mr Tsipras urged Greeks, at a \"No\" rally later on Friday evening, to say a \"proud 'No' to the ultimatums\". \n \n In his TV address, Mr Tsipras referred to an IMF report published on Thursday which said Greece would need an extra \u20ac50bn euros ($55bn; \u00a336bn) over the next three years to stabilise its finances and repeated suggestions that Greece needed debt relief. \n \n The recent negotiations were over the release of a final tranche of bailout funds of \u20ac7.2bn. \n \n Greece's mountain of \u20ac323bn debt was \"not sustainable\", Mr Tsipras said. He said he had called for a 30% \"haircut\" off the debt and a 20-year grace period for the rest. \n \n Mr Tsipras urged voters to reject the \"sirens of scaremongering\", but added that: \"Whatever we choose... Come Monday we are all together.\" \n \n Mr Tsipras faces vocal opposition at home - with opposition leader Antonis Samaras calling on \"every Greek man and every Greek woman above and beyond parties\" to vote \"Yes\", along with several deputies from Syriza's own coalition partner, the Independent Greeks. \n \n Lenders' proposals: Key sticking points \n \n VAT (sales tax): Alexis Tsipras accepts a new three-tier system, but wants to keep 30% discount on the Greek islands' VAT rates.

(Associated Press) \n \n More than 40,000 people gathered at the two rallies, half a mile (800 meters) apart, before Sunday's vote on whether to accept creditors' proposals for more austerity in exchange for rescue loans, or reject the deal as a show of defiance against years of harsh economic austerity. \n \n \"This is not a protest. It is a celebration to overcome fear and blackmail,\" Tsipras told a crowd of 25,000 in front of parliament, who were chanting oxi, oxi\u2014 \"no, no.\" \n \n Meanwhile, police said about 17,000 people gathered outside the nearby Panathenian stadium for the \"yes\" rally, waving Greek and European Union flags and chanting \"Greece, Europe, Democracy.\" \n \n Rallies for both campaigns were also held in 10 other Greek cities Friday. \n \n Tsipras is gambling the future of his five-month-old left wing government on Sunday's snap poll \u2014 insisting a \"no\" vote will strengthen his hand to negotiate a third bailout with better terms. \n \n But the high-stakes standoff with lenders this week saw Greece default on debts, close banks to avoid their collapse, and lose access to billions of euros as an existing bailout deal expired. \n \n At the \"no\" rally, Athens resident Maria Antiniou held a handmade sign, reading \"oxi.\" \n \n \"We have to strengthen Tsipras. It's not his fault we are bankrupt,\" she said. \n \n \"He doesn't have the mandate to take tougher measures and now we are giving that to him. It's not true this is a vote on the euro. It's a vote to change course and stay in the euro, and Tsipras is our best hope,\" she said. \n \n That is a message the \"yes\" voters refuse believe. \n \n Evgenia Bouzala, a Greek born in Germany, said she was considering shutting down her olive oil export business because of the financial turmoil. \n \n \"I don't think we can keep going. Look at what happened in the last three days. Imagine if that lasts another six months,\" she said. \n \n \"A 'yes' vote would bring a caretaker government and that would probably be better ... We have to start over.\" \n \n The drama remained high in the final hours of campaigning. \n \n The country's top court stayed in session till the late afternoon before rejecting a petition to declare the referendum illegal, while party leaders, personalities, and church elders weighed in with impassioned pleas to vote \"no\" or \"yes\" on the airwaves and social media. \n \n In a rare public declaration, 16 former armed forces leaders wrote an appeal to citizens to show \"calm and national unity.\" \n \n A series of polls published Friday at the end of a frantic weeklong campaign showed the two sides in a dead heat, with an incremental lead of the \"yes\" vote well within the margin of error. \n \n But they showed an overwhelming majority of people \u2014 about 75 percent \u2014 want Greece to remain in the euro currency. \n \n Much of the ambiguity arises from the complicated question on the ballot paper: \n \n \"Must the agreement plan submitted by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund to the Eurogroup of 25 June, 2015, and comprised of two parts which make up their joint proposal, be accepted? The first document is titled 'reforms for the completion of the current program and beyond' and the second 'Preliminary debt sustainability analysis.'\" \n \n Voters are asked to check one of two boxes: \"not approved/no\" and \u2014 below it \u2014 \"approved/yes.\" \n \n \"People don't even understand the question,\" Athens Mayor George Kaminis told supporters at the \"yes\" rally. \n \n \"We have been dragged into a pointless referendum that is dividing the people and hurting the country.\" \n \n Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis told Ireland's RTE radio Friday that an agreement with creditors \"is more or less done\" and that the only issue left is debt relief. \n \n But the head of the eurozone finance ministers' group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, rejected the idea, pointing out that negotiations had been broken off. \n \n \"There are no new proposals from our side and, whatever happens, the future for Greece will be extremely tough,\" Dijsselbloem said. \n \n \"To get Greece back on track and the economy out of the slump, tough decisions will have to be taken and every politician that says that won't be the case following a 'no' vote is deceiving his population.\" \n \n Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble told his country's Bild daily that any negotiations after the Greek vote \"will take a while.\" \n \n No campaigning is allowed the day before an election in Greece, so Friday's rallies would be the closing salvoes in the battle to persuade voters ahead of Sunday. \n \n ___ \n \n Online: Official referendum website http://www.referendum2015gov.gr/en/ \n \n ___ \n \n Elena Becatoros and Costas Kantouris in Athens, Geir Moulson in Berlin and Michael Corder in The Hague, Netherlands, contributed to this report",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Greece's top court has declared that Sunday's referendum on a bailout is constitutional, meaning the vote with huge implications for all of Europe will proceed. The latest polls show a dead heat, reports AP, as leaders on both sides try to rally support\u2014especially Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, whose political life may be at stake. \u201cI ask you to say no to ultimatums, blackmail, and fear-mongering,\u201d he said in a TV address. \u201cNo to divisions, no to those who want to spread panic.\u201d He sought to downplay the notion that a \"no\" vote could lead to Greece leaving the euro zone. Instead, he said, the referendum is about giving him more leverage to get a better deal from creditors. It's the only way Greece can \"live with dignity in Europe,\" he said, per the BBC. The Washington Post has a primer on the financial reasons behind the vote, but a story in the New York Times casts it in more personal terms. It's largely become a referendum on Tsipras himself, and the story suggests that's why European leaders itching to get rid of him limited emergency funds to Greek banks this week. The move set off a panic among people scrambling for cash, and his popularity tumbled. \u201cI don\u2019t see how anybody can believe that the timing of this was coincidence,\u201d says a US economist. \u201cWhen you restrict the flow of cash enough to close the banks during the week of a referendum, this is a very deliberate move to scare people.\u201d Tsipras initially said he would step down if the \"yes\" vote prevails, but he has since backed down from that position.",

But it was at least as much a deal to buy time for the banks and other owners of Greek debt to avoid a default,\" writes Philip Bump at the Atlantic. \"If the public sides with Greece\u2019s government, then there will be a very sharp recession over the next few months,\" he adds. \"Tax collection is likely to collapse.

    "document": "David Blankenhorn, founder of the Institute for American Values, has written a thoughtful short essay for the New York Times on why he has devoted considerable effort to defeating efforts to legalize same-sex civil marriage and why he has decided to embrace a new strategy. He notes that he had hoped that our national conversation about same-sex marriage would evolve into a broader conversation about the centrality of marriage and child-rearing, yet he sees no sign of that happening. So he concludes on the following note: \n \n Instead of fighting gay marriage, I\u2019d like to help build new coalitions bringing together gays who want to strengthen marriage with straight people who want to do the same. For example, once we accept gay marriage, might we also agree that marrying before having children is a vital cultural value that all of us should do more to embrace? Can we agree that, for all lovers who want their love to last, marriage is preferable to cohabitation? Can we discuss whether both gays and straight people should think twice before denying children born through artificial reproductive technology the right to know and be known by their biological parents? Will this strategy work? I don\u2019t know. But I hope to find out. \n \n Blankenhorn\u2019s current position closely parallels my own. It is worth noting, however, that Blankenhorn\u2019s new strategy actually represents a harder road than opposition to the legalization of same-sex civil marriage. Opponents of same-sex civil marriage will from time to time achieve concrete political victories. Those who want to reestablish the cultural centrality of marriage, in contrast, won\u2019t have concrete victories to celebrate. Rather, they will have to navigate a fragmented cultural landscape in which it is crucially important to understand the difference between simple contagions and complex contagions, an idea a very good friend explained to me relatively recently. \n \n The following is the abstract of a paper by Damon Centola and Michael Macy: \n \n The strength of weak ties is that they tend to be long\u2014they connect socially distant locations, allowing information to diffuse rapidly. The authors test whether this \u201cstrength of weak ties\u201d generalizes from simple to complex contagions. Complex contagions require social af\ufb01rmation from multiple sources. Examples include the spread of high-risk social movements, avant garde fashions, and unproven technologies. Results show that as adoption thresholds increase, long ties can impede diffusion. Complex contagions depend primarily on the width of the bridges across a network, not just their length. Wide bridges are a characteristic feature of many spatial networks, which may account in part for the widely observed tendency for social movements to diffuse spatially. \n \n Crudely, it is interesting to think about \u201cwide bridges\u201d in the context of the diffusion of various social practices. In the United States, divorce levels have decreased among college-educated women since 1980, as Kay Hymowitz has observed. Yet this hasn\u2019t translated to non-college-educated women, in part, presumably, because we don\u2019t (to overgeneralize) have \u201cwide bridges\u201d in U.S. society between the college-educated and the non-college-educated. \n \n This has important implications for cultural conservatives. Family disruption in the United States is increasingly pervasive, yet it remains concentrated in groups that tend not to see elite non-black and non-Latino conservatives as culturally credible. That is part why the message Blankenhorn is articulating isn\u2019t resonating with the constituencies for whom it is (arguably) most relevant. There are, of course, many cultural conservatives in the communities most heavily impacted by family disruption, but it\u2019s not clear that these individuals have the kind of cultural and spiritual authority they\u2019d need to make a significant difference, partly because social uplift is seen as primarily state-driven and not community-driven. That is, I don\u2019t turn to the pastor or deacon to weather a family crisis. I turn to the state for transfers or for other forms of care, as alternative social networks are too weak by comparison or too overburdened. So why would the pastor or deacon hold sway? I should stress that this is a serious oversimplication, but I do think it helps explain the larger landscape. ||||| David Blankenhorn, a national figure in the movement against same-sex marriage, has recanted his opposition, saying \u201cthe time has come for me to accept gay marriage and emphasize the good that it can do.\u201d \n \n Mr. Blankenhorn, the founder and president of the Institute for American Values, wrote an influential book that argued against same-sex marriage in 2007, called \u201cThe Future of Marriage,\u201d and served as an expert witness against the constitutional challenge to California\u2019s Proposition 8, which limited marriage to heterosexuals. On Friday, he said in an opinion article for The New York Times, published online, and in an hour-long documentary on NPR that his concerns about same-sex marriage remained, but that \u201cthe time for denigrating or stigmatizing same-sex relationships is over.\u201d \n \n \u201cI opposed gay marriage believing that children have the right, insofar as society makes it possible, to know and to be cared for by the two parents who brought them into this world,\u201d he wrote in the article. He said he still held that conviction. But he added, \u201cWhatever one\u2019s definition of marriage, legally recognizing gay and lesbian couples and their children is a victory for basic fairness.\u201d \n \n Photo \n \n Mr. Blankenhorn\u2019s onetime allies said they were troubled but unimpressed. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s dead wrong,\u201d said the Rev. Jim Garlow, senior pastor of Skyline Wesleyan Church in La Mesa, Calif. \u201cI am a student of history. Christianity has made clear that marriage is between one man and one woman. And what we have seen is that when you change marriage for some, you change marriage for all.\u201d \n \n The focus on same-sex marriage has grown rapidly in recent years, both legislatively and legally. Two requests for review of same-sex marriage rulings in federal courts, including the Proposition 8 case, are headed to the Supreme Court this summer. Other cases are being argued in lower courts, and referendum initiatives will be on the ballots in November in four states \u2014 Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington. \n \n Last month, President Obama endorsed same-sex marriage after nearly two years of saying that his views on the topic had been evolving. Polls show public opinion has also been shifting rapidly toward acceptance of it, although about 30 states have passed constitutional amendments in recent years defining marriage as between only a man and a woman. \n \n Six states \u2014 Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York and Vermont \u2014 as well as the District of Columbia permit same-sex marriage. Nine others \u2014 California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Oregon and Washington \u2014 allow comprehensive domestic partnerships or civil unions granting same-sex couples full rights except in name. \n \n Mr. Blankenhorn, who was raised in the South and attended Harvard, had long stood out among opponents of same-sex marriage because he did not invoke a biblical or religious justification and did not oppose civil unions for gay men and lesbians. Instead, he argued that marriage was society\u2019s most important institution and had in recent decades come under attack, and that same-sex marriage was only adding to its decline. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n He said that he had long hoped the debate over same-sex marriage would center on parenthood, not private relationships, but that in the public\u2019s mind today the issue was simply about equality for gay men and lesbians \u2014 in other words, civil rights. \n \n \u201cAnd to my deep regret,\u201d he wrote, \u201cmuch of the opposition to gay marriage seems to stem, at least in part, from an underlying antigay animus. To me, a Southerner by birth whose formative moral experience was the civil rights movement, this fact is profoundly disturbing.\u201d \n \n Mr. Blankenhorn has long had his fans in the pro-gay-rights community. Andrew Sullivan, who writes for The Daily Beast, wrote on Friday that Mr. Blankenhorn was \u201cperhaps the most clearly decent, intellectually honest, nonhomophobic opponent of marriage equality.\u201d He praised him for his switch. \n \n Peter S. Sprigg, the senior fellow for policy studies at the Family Research Council in Washington, which opposes same-sex marriage, said Mr. Blankenhorn\u2019s new position was unfortunate but was, in his view, a result of social pressure and his eagerness not to be seen as antigay. \n \n \u201cHe has thrown marriage under the bus for the sake of the homosexual movement,\u201d Mr. Sprigg said. ||||| IN my 2007 book, \u201cThe Future of Marriage,\u201d and in my 2010 court testimony concerning Proposition 8 , the California ballot initiative that defined marriage as between a man and a woman, I took a stand against gay marriage. But as a marriage advocate, the time has come for me to accept gay marriage and emphasize the good that it can do. I\u2019d like to explain why. \n \n I opposed gay marriage believing that children have the right, insofar as society makes it possible, to know and to be cared for by the two parents who brought them into this world. I didn\u2019t just dream up this notion: the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which came into force in 1990, guarantees children this right. \n \n Marriage is how society recognizes and protects this right. Marriage is the planet\u2019s only institution whose core purpose is to unite the biological, social and legal components of parenthood into one lasting bond. Marriage says to a child: The man and the woman whose sexual union made you will also be there to love and raise you. In this sense, marriage is a gift that society bestows on its children. \n \n At the level of first principles, gay marriage effaces that gift. No same-sex couple, married or not, can ever under any circumstances combine biological, social and legal parenthood into one bond. For this and other reasons, gay marriage has become a significant contributor to marriage\u2019s continuing deinstitutionalization, by which I mean marriage\u2019s steady transformation in both law and custom from a structured institution with clear public purposes to the state\u2019s licensing of private relationships that are privately defined. \n \n I have written these things in my book and said them in my testimony, and I believe them today. I am not recanting any of it. \n \n But there are more good things under heaven than these beliefs. For me, the most important is the equal dignity of homosexual love. I don\u2019t believe that opposite-sex and same-sex relationships are the same, but I do believe, with growing numbers of Americans, that the time for denigrating or stigmatizing same-sex relationships is over. Whatever one\u2019s definition of marriage, legally recognizing gay and lesbian couples and their children is a victory for basic fairness. \n \n Another good thing is comity. Surely we must live together with some degree of mutual acceptance, even if doing so involves compromise. Sticking to one\u2019s position no matter what can be a virtue. But bending the knee a bit, in the name of comity, is not always the same as weakness. As I look at what our society needs most today, I have no stomach for what we often too glibly call \u201cculture wars.\u201d Especially on this issue, I\u2019m more interested in conciliation than in further fighting. \n \n A third good thing is respect for an emerging consensus. The population as a whole remains deeply divided, but most of our national elites, as well as most younger Americans, favor gay marriage. This emerging consensus may be wrong on the merits. But surely it matters. \n \n I had hoped that the gay marriage debate would be mostly about marriage\u2019s relationship to parenthood. But it hasn\u2019t been. Or perhaps it\u2019s fairer to say that I and others have made that argument, and that we have largely failed to persuade. In the mind of today\u2019s public, gay marriage is almost entirely about accepting lesbians and gay men as equal citizens. And to my deep regret, much of the opposition to gay marriage seems to stem, at least in part, from an underlying anti-gay animus. To me, a Southerner by birth whose formative moral experience was the civil rights movement, this fact is profoundly disturbing. \n \n I had also hoped that debating gay marriage might help to lead heterosexual America to a broader and more positive recommitment to marriage as an institution. But it hasn\u2019t happened. With each passing year, we see higher and higher levels of unwed childbearing, nonmarital cohabitation and family fragmentation among heterosexuals. Perhaps some of this can be attributed to the reconceptualization of marriage as a private ordering that is so central to the idea of gay marriage. But either way, if fighting gay marriage was going to help marriage over all, I think we\u2019d have seen some signs of it by now. \n \n So my intention is to try something new. Instead of fighting gay marriage, I\u2019d like to help build new coalitions bringing together gays who want to strengthen marriage with straight people who want to do the same. For example, once we accept gay marriage, might we also agree that marrying before having children is a vital cultural value that all of us should do more to embrace? Can we agree that, for all lovers who want their love to last, marriage is preferable to cohabitation? Can we discuss whether both gays and straight people should think twice before denying children born through artificial reproductive technology the right to know and be known by their biological parents? \n \n Will this strategy work? I don\u2019t know. But I hope to find out. ||||| If you've been immersed in the marriage equality debate, you'll know who David Blankenhorn is. He is perhaps the most clearly decent, intellectually honest, non-homophobic opponent of marriage equality. He has played a huge role in elevating the debate, in getting the right to take it more seriously, and in pioneering civil discussion. Along with Jon Rauch, he really tried to find common ground, rather than polarize or hyperbolize. And I think many involved in this intellectual combat can be proud of themselves for maintaining greater civility than exists in many other emotional, personal debates. In the grass roots it can get brutal, as it can online. But the arguments we've had in person have been usually civil. Jon Corvino's book with Maggie Gallagher is an example of this, as is their dog-and-pony show on the debate circuit. \n \n But I bury my lede. Blankenhorn has switched sides and is now in favor of marriage equality, and explains why on NPR right now. Click here for the audio. He has an essay in the NYT on the subject as well.

The rootstock contributes vigor and disease resistance while the scion is chosen for fruit flavor and quality. Grafting has been used in agriculture for centuries to improve plant health and yield (fruit trees and grape vines are two familiar examples). Grafted vegetables are currently widespread in Asia and Europe among produce growers and are gaining popularity in the US, especially with organic farmers. Our plants are grafted by hand in a unique, carefully controlled environment using innovative methods recently developed here in Oregon. \n \n \n \n Grafted vegetables help solve common garden problems. Vigorous rootstock enables more effective uptake of water and nutrients, and increases plants' resistance to pests or disease and tolerance to temperature extremes and drought. This allows commercial growers \u2014 and now home gardeners \u2014 to plant earlier and harvest longer. Healthier, stronger plants also mean greatly reduced pesticide use and more yield. With grafted tomato plants, even gardeners in challenging climates can enjoy ample harvests of America's favorite garden crop. \n \n \n \n Grafted plants are drop-dead gorgeous \n \n Statuesque, strong, and loaded with flowers and fruit, they remain beautifully healthy and disease-resistant when the same non-grafted varieties oftentimes struggle. \n \n \n \n Benefits of Grafted plants over non-grafted plants \n \n \u2022 Better quality crops and increased fruit production \n \n \u2022 Increased water and nutrient uptake \n \n \u2022 Extended harvests \n \n \u2022 Increased disease resistance including resistance to early and late blight and blossom end rot in tomatoes \n \n \u2022 Increased overall plant vigor \n \n \u2022 Increased tolerance to environmental stresses (extremes in heat and cold, salinity, etc.) \n \n \n \n Our plants are available individually in 2 1/4 inch pots!

It is distributing to independent garden centers and through the Territorial Seed Company mail order firm. A video shows how the combo plant yields cherry tomatoes above ground and spuds below ground. \n \n \u201cEach plant is grafted by hand to ensure that unique double cropping,\u201d the narrator says in the video. \n \n So it\u2019s not a miracle of genetic engineering, but rather a simple graft of the top of one plant onto the rootstock of the other one. \n \n The reason this works is that potatoes and tomatoes are closely related. The grafted plant first yields lots of cherry tomatoes and when that winds down, puts its energy into maturing its potatoes. \n \n Grafting can be done at home, but requires skill and practice. In this case, the tomato stem and potato stem need to have the same thickness. The graft entails making a clean cut of both plant stems and then taping two ends together until they heal. \n \n The British mail order nursery that commercialized the combo plant dubbed it the TomTato, also known as \u201cKetchup \u2018n\u2019 Fries.\u201d An imitator in New Zealand called its version the Potato Tom. \n \n \u201cPeople have been grafting tomatoes and potatoes for a while, but mostly as a novelty,\u201d said Territorial Seed Company marketing director Tim Russell. Prior to commercialization, he said research was needed \u201cto find a variety of potato and tomato that complement each other well.\u201d \n \n Russell said the unusual combo plant generated \u201clots of comments and buzz\u201d almost from the moment it appeared in his company\u2019s 2015 catalog and was promoted via Facebook. \u201cPeople are excited,\u201d Russell observed.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Tomatoes and potatoes go together like, well, ketchup and fries\u2014so why not grow them together? A hybrid plant known as the \"TomTato\" or, yes, \"Ketchup 'n' Fries,\" allows you to do just that, and it's now available in the US after first being released in the UK. The plant combines a vine growing cherry tomatoes with roots growing white potatoes\u2014but it's not genetically engineered. Rather, it's created by grafting, in which the tomatoes are \"spliced onto potato rootstock,\" the Oregonian explains, noting the process works well for tomatoes and potatoes because they are closely related. Technically, you could try to do it at home, but it requires the plant stems you're joining be the same thickness. SuperNaturals Grafted Vegetables is the company handling the grafting process in the US, and home gardeners can purchase the non-GMO plant in a 2.5-inch pot from the Territorial Seed Company. \"People have been grafting tomatoes and potatoes for a while, but mostly as a novelty,\" Territorial's marketing director tells OPB, noting that before this plant was commercialized, it was necessary to research varieties to find ones that \"complement each other well.\" Now, purchasers can expect to harvest some 500 red cherry tomatoes and 4.5 pounds of potatoes from each plant. Back in 2013 when the plant was only available in the UK, Stephen Colbert featured it on his \"The Craziest F#?ing Thing I've Ever Heard\" segment, calling it \"unnatural\" and noting, \"The only time tomatoes and potatoes should meet is at the bottom of a Styrofoam clamshell.\" (Read about a tree that grows 40 different fruits.)",

The South Carolina Education Lottery (SCEL) Board of Commissioners voted to reimburse the purchase price paid by each Holiday Cash Add-A-Play ticketholder bought on December 25, 2017 on or after 5:51 p.m. because these tickets were produced or issued in error. This decision is required by South Carolina Code Section 59-150-230(C)(3)(a) which provides that prizes arising from a ticket produced or issued in error must not be paid. \n \n \n \n Before making the decision the tickets were produced or issued in error, SCEL retained Gaming Laboratories International, LLC (GLI) to conduct an independent, impartial analysis. We appreciate players\u2019 patience during this independent investigation. The results of this analysis revealed coding errors by SCEL\u2019s former computer gaming vendor, and the vendor\u2019s inadequate quality assurance testing that would have discovered these errors prior to deployment of this game. These actions caused approximately 71,000 plays (wagers) to be erroneously produced, issued and printed with nine (9) Tree symbols, which were incorrectly recognized as a $500 winning play. Regrettably, these errors by the former vendor led loyal players to mistakenly believe that they held winning tickets. While SCEL is mindful of the magnitude of this decision on its players, any other decision would not comply with the law. \n \n \n \n To seek the refund of the purchase price of the tickets, a player should mail the original Holiday Cash Add-A-Play tickets (no copies or other reproductions will be processed for reimbursement) purchased on or after 5:51(17:51) P.M. on December 25, 2017 to this address: \n \n \n \n S.C.

And on Christmas Day no less. \n \n Between 5:51 p.m. and 7:53 p.m. last December, South Carolinians playing the state lottery were treated to tens of thousands of winning Holiday Cash Add-A-Play tickets, each worth up to $500 regardless of the holder's good or bad behavior. \n \n It was an improbable lucky streak that was, in fact, too good to be true. And on Wednesday, the South Carolina Education Lottery announced it will not be delivering more than $30 million in prizes to players who bought tickets during the brief window \"because they had been produced in error.\" \n \n A computer glitch was behind the fortuitous \u2014 or unfortunate \u2014 anomaly, depending on what side you're on, that caused gas stations and convenience stores to issue about 71,000 winning plays. \n \n The objective of the tic-tac-toe-like game was to line up three Christmas trees in any direction \u2014 horizontal, vertical or diagonal \u2014 for a cash prize ranging from $2 to $500. But lottery officials said a five-month analysis of the incident \"revealed coding errors\" leading machines to repeatedly print tickets depicting nine tree symbols resulting in the biggest prize. \n \n The South Carolina Education Lottery blamed its former computer gaming vendor, Intralot. The state lottery said the Greece-based company failed to run adequate quality assurance testing prior to deploying the game. \n \n \"Regrettably, these errors by the former vendor led loyal players to mistakenly believe that they held winning tickets,\" the South Carolina Education Lottery said in a statement. \n \n \"This is a very unusual and specific situation because it has to do with the nature of the game,\" an Intralot representative told NPR, adding that he could not go into further detail. \n \n The official noted the company's quick response time to the mistake. \"We all became aware of the problem within hours,\" he said. \"We were able to identify that there was unusual behavior very quickly and we followed the correct procedure to shut it down.\" \n \n \"We think it was a pretty good response,\" he said. \n \n Winners-in-waiting have been holding out hope that the lottery board of commissioners would decide to honor the prize value of the tickets. But after an hours-long meeting Wednesday the commissioners ruled players would be reimbursed only for the cost of each lottery ticket: $1 for each claim that is mailed in. \n \n \"This was not a lottery discretionary matter,\" Tim Madden, one of the lottery's attorneys told FOX Carolina. \"Once this board decided that these tickets were issued, produced or printed in error, then state law mandates that no prize shall be paid.\" \n \n Holli Armstrong, a spokeswoman for the South Carolina Education Lottery, told NPR the cost of the error-filled tickets would have totaled approximately $35 million. But in light of the board's decision, the lottery is out about $1.7 million \u2014 the sum players were able to cash-in before the mistake was discovered on Christmas Day. \n \n That leaves scores of unhappy people who feel they're entitled to the full cash prize. \n \n \"It's not fair,\" Nicole Coggins complained to The New York Times. \"It's not right.\" Coggins was planning on making large purchases with her winnings, including a car and a trip to Disneyland. \n \n Coggins is part of one of two lawsuits that have so far been filed against the state lottery and Intralot on behalf of people who have been denied prize money, according to the Times. \n \n The South Carolina Education Lottery reported record ticket sales in the most recent fiscal year (2016 - 2017) totalling $1.64 billion and issued more than $1 billion in prizes. Nearly $5 billion has been allocated to education programs throughout the state since the start of the lottery in 2002.",

Last year on Christmas Day, lottery dispensers at convenience stores and gas stations across South Carolina started doing something remarkable.

Lottery officials quickly figured out the problem, and cashiers began seeing the message, \u201ctransaction not allowed,\u201d when customers went to collect their prizes, reports the Washington Post. But before the bonanza was over, 71,000 of the $1 Holiday Cash Add-A-Play tickets had been dispensed, with the errant prize money totaling about $35 million. So, what happens to all the winning tickets that were rejected? They are worth exactly $1, the state lottery board announced on Wednesday. The winners will not get their prize money, but they can get a refund. After a five-month investigation, lottery officials found the problem was caused by coding errors, reports NPR. The officials say Intralot, a Greece-based ticket vendor, did not run proper testing procedures before releasing the game. \"While [the state lottery] is mindful of the magnitude of this decision on its players, any other decision would not comply with the law,\u201d officials said, per the New York Times.

    "document": "Washington (CNN) Ever since reaching a deal with special counsel Robert Mueller, Paul Manafort has kept the Russia prosecutors busy. \n \n The former Trump campaign chairman and his lawyers have visited Mueller's office in Washington at least nine times in the last four weeks, a strong indication that the special counsel is moving at a steady clip. \n \n September and October at first glance appear to be quiet periods for the investigation, under the Justice Department's guidelines to avoid public political acts before the midterm elections. But the quiet period has seen a persistent murmur of activity, based on near-daily sightings of Mueller's prosecutors and sources involved in the investigation. \n \n In addition to Manafort, Mueller's team has kept interviewing witnesses, gathered a grand jury weekly to meet in Washington on most Fridays, and kicked up other still-secret court action. Plus, the discussions between the President's legal team and the special counsel's office have intensified in recent weeks, including after the special counsel sent questions about possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian government. The President's attorneys are expected to reply to the questions in writing. \n \n People around Trump and other witnesses believe more criminal indictments will come from Mueller. \n \n Attorneys who have dealt with Mueller's investigators and other officials expect that the special counsel's efforts, now 17 months in the works, will include an active post-election period a much-anticipated report where Mueller will outline what his investigators decided to prosecute and what they declined. \n \n Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the investigation, on Wednesday called the probe \"appropriate and independent,\" in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. \n \n \"[A]t the end of the day, the public will have confidence that the cases we brought were warranted by the evidence and that it was an appropriate use of resources.\" \n \n A frequent cooperator \n \n At least nine times since he pleaded guilty on September 14, a black Ford SUV has brought Manafort to Mueller's office in southwest DC around 10 am. Manafort's lawyers arrive around the same time, waiting in the lobby for the car to arrive. There they remain inside the offices, typically for six hours. \n \n It's not entirely clear yet what Manafort has shared with prosecutors, and if his interviews check facts that haven't yet come to light outside of the prosecutors' own notes. Among the questions, investigators have asked Manafort about his dealings with Russians, according to one source familiar with the matter. \n \n Attorneys for Manafort would not discuss their activities for this story. \n \n The visits amount to what could total dozens of hours of interviews between Mueller's prosecutors and Manafort since he finalized his plea agreement. Manafort agreed to fully cooperate with the Justice Department as it investigates the Trump campaign and the Russian government's actions before the 2016 election. \n \n At the same time, Trump has distanced himself from crimes investigators still may be pursuing. He publicly claimed this week that criminal charges so far brought by Mueller's team have nothing to do with him. Trump attorneys declined to comment for this story. \n \n Other help \n \n The flurry of interviews with Manafort and other cooperating defendants leaves Trump's legal team somewhat in the dark on what Mueller is pursuing. \n \n Manafort's lawyers have shared information with the Trump legal team, but according to sources familiar with the case, there is no formal joint defense agreement. \n \n Manafort's criminal confessions and separate conviction by a jury dealt with his Ukrainian lobbying work and financial dealings largely before 2016. Yet his cooperation is widely expected to include helping the prosecutors build potential criminal cases about coordination between the Russian government and Trump campaign. \n \n Aside from Manafort, three other Trump campaign officials have pleaded guilty to charges. Two of them, campaign deputy Rick Gates and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, also agreed to broadly help Mueller's team with its investigation and have visited the special counsel's office to give interviews since their pleas. \n \n Mueller's team has also been speaking with Michael Cohen , Trump's former personal attorney, who has spent hours with Mueller's team since his own guilty plea in August, in which he accused President Donald Trump of directing him to commit a crime. \n \n Trump legal team \n \n Meanwhile, Trump's team is working up answers to Mueller's questions. Even if the defense team were to sign and deliver their answers soon, Mueller's office may have follow-up questions that drag out their discussions. The legal team, comprised of personal and White House lawyers Jay Sekulow, Marty and Jane Raskin and Emmet Flood, still hasn't reached an agreement on whether the President will be interviewed in person or must respond to questions about possible obstruction of justice related to his firing of FBI Director James Comey. \n \n While they're in investigatory limbo, expectations have grown in Washington legal circles that Mueller will issue a report soon after the November election or even before the end of the year. \n \n When it's finished, Mueller's report is expected to explain the decisions of the Justice Department to bring or to decline to bring criminal cases during the course of the investigation. Mueller's findings and decisions will be confidential, unless higher-up officials in the Justice Department decide to make the report public. \n \n As of now, the Trump legal team operates under the belief that Mueller won't finish his work without bringing indictments that hit closer to the Trump campaign. \n \n JUST WATCHED Trump doesn't 'trust everybody in the White House' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Trump doesn't 'trust everybody in the White House' 01:46 \n \n Activity in the DC courthouse \n \n The next campaign contact in Mueller's crosshairs may be Trump adviser Roger Stone, who's publicly said he expects to be indicted after nine of his friends and aides spoke to Mueller's office or received grand jury subpoenas. In the last two weeks, multiple contacts of Stone have been in touch with the special counsel's office about them providing information, according to CNN's reporting. \n \n Special counsel prosecutors have also visited the federal courthouse in downtown Washington almost daily. \n \n Once in early September and once in early October, Chief Judge Beryl Howell held hour-long sealed hearings in her courtroom featuring trial and appellate prosecutors from Mueller's office. Both times, the lawyers opposite the Justice Department declined to share with CNN their names, clients names or law firms. Howell oversees court action related to the federal grand jury that Mueller has used to approve indictments in DC. \n \n Previously she has ordered two witnesses -- a real estate agent and a lawyer -- to testify against Manafort before the grand jury, and she held Andrew Miller, a Stone associate, in contempt for refusing to comply with a subpoena. The real estate and lawyer orders became public on the eve of Manafort's indictment last October, and Miller's attorneys spoke publicly about his subpoena challenge as it was ongoing. \n \n Other times in the courthouse in recent weeks, the Mueller investigators visit the chief judge's chambers and then clerk's office, indicating a flurry of court paperwork. \n \n A spokesperson for Howell and the federal court in DC declined to comment on the nature of the recent sealed court activity, as did a spokesman for the special counsel's office. \n \n As the court action moves forward, Trump himself has said he is working on giving information to Mueller. When asked by the Associated Press on Tuesday if he would sit for an interview with Mueller or simply answer written questions, as his lawyers have agreed to do, Trump said: \"You know that's in process. It's a tremendous waste of time for the president of the United States.\" ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

The new ruling no longer gives them that option. \n \n In September, Manafort took a plea deal based on separate charges filed by the Mueller team in Washington, agreeing to cooperate with investigators. Court filings in that case indicated that the prosecutors would seek to delay Manafort's sentence in the Virginia case until they were satisfied that he had answered all their questions as part of his cooperation agreement. \n \n Both cases against Manafort involved his political consulting for the Russian-backed government of Ukraine and its former president, Viktor Yanukovych, well before Manafort served briefly as Trump's campaign chairman. Manafort was found guilty of intentionally dodging taxes on the millions he was paid for the work, by stashing it in overseas banks and using it to indulge his expensive tastes. \n \n The Virginia federal judge, T.S. Ellis, denied an earlier request by Manafort to wear a suit to Friday's court hearing. \n \n \"Defendants who are in custody post-conviction are, as a matter of course, not entitled to appear for sentencing or any other hearing in street clothing,\" he said. \n \n The judge said Manafort should be treated no differently.",

A person said to be \"familiar with Manafort's condition\" tells CNN his issue is serious and is inflammation-based, tied to what he's been eating. Judge TS Ellis had earlier struck down the Manafort legal team's request that their client be permitted to wear a regular suit to Friday's hearing, with Ellis noting \"defendants who are in custody post-conviction are, as a matter of course, not entitled to appear for sentencing or any other hearing in street clothing,\" per NBC. Ellis gave Manafort a sentencing date of Feb. 8, where he'll hear his fate on eight counts of tax evasion and bank fraud. The judge also dismissed 10 additional charges on which the jury deadlocked during the trial, though CNN notes if Manafort doesn't keep cooperating with Robert Mueller's investigation, those charges could be reinstated.

(Associated Press) \n \n WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The head of the Environmental Protection Agency has broken months of silence about his frequent premium-class flights at taxpayer expense, saying he needs to fly first class because of unpleasant interactions with other travelers. \n \n EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt spoke about his flight costs on Tuesday in a pair of interviews in New Hampshire, following a first-class flight to meet with the state's Republican governor and tour a toxic waste site. \n \n Pruitt told the New Hampshire Union Leader he had some \"incidents\" on flights shortly after his appointment by President Donald Trump last year. \n \n \"We live in a very toxic environment politically, particularly around issues of the environment,\" said Pruitt, who confirmed to the newspaper that he had flown first class from Washington to Boston before continuing on to New Hampshire. \"We've reached the point where there's not much civility in the marketplace and it's created, you know, it's created some issues and the (security) detail, the level of protection is determined by the level of threat.\" \n \n Pruitt is the first EPA administrator to have a 24-hour security detail that accompanies him at all times, even at the agency's headquarters in Washington. He has also taken other security precautions, including the addition of a $25,000 soundproof \"privacy booth\" to prevent eavesdropping on his phone calls and spending $3,000 to have his office swept for hidden listening devices. \n \n Pruitt said he was not involved in the decision for him to fly first class. \n \n \"There have been instances, unfortunately, during my time as administrator, as I've flown and spent time, of interaction that's not been the best,\" Pruitt told WMUR TV in Manchester, New Hampshire. \"And, so, ingress and egress off the plane ... that's all decisions all made by our (security) detail team, by the chief of staff, by the administration. I don't make any of those decisions. They place me on the plane where they think is best from a safety perspective.\" \n \n Pruitt was asked about the issue following a Washington Post report on Sunday that detailed some of his travel expenses, including a $1,641.43 first-class seat for a short flight in June from Washington to New York City. Pruitt's ticket cost six times what EPA paid for his aides seated in coach. \n \n The Associated Press reported in July and again in December that spending on commercial airline tickets purchased for Pruitt indicated he was flying in premium-class seats. EPA's press office has repeatedly refused to comment on whether Pruitt was flying first class. \n \n Federal regulations allow government travelers to fly business class or first class when no cheaper options are \"reasonably available\" or if there are exceptional security circumstances. However, past federal audits have found that those rules have been routinely violated by high-ranking government officials under both Republican and Democratic administrations. \n \n The use of luxury air travel by members of Trump's Cabinet has been under scrutiny for months, after the resignation of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in September following media reports he spent at least $400,000 in taxpayer funds on private jets for himself and his staff. \n \n A report released Wednesday by the inspector general at the Department of Veterans Affairs found that Secretary David Shulkin and his staff made \"false representations\" to justify his wife accompanying him at taxpayer expense on an 11-day European trip that mixed business and sightseeing. \n \n Records show Pruitt has taken at least four flights on non-commercial aircraft, costing more than $58,000. EPA has said all of those flights were necessary and pre-approved by ethics lawyers. \n \n EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox did not immediately respond Wednesday to questions about whether Pruitt had been granted similar waivers allowing him to fly premium class or about the past security incidents to which Pruitt referred. \n \n Pruitt's frequent government-funded travel, which records show has often included weekend layovers in his home state of Oklahoma, is currently under review by EPA's internal watchdog. The office of EPA Inspector General Arthur Elkins said Wednesday it expects to release the results of its investigation by summer. \n \n Meanwhile, the White House's budget proposal for EPA released earlier this week seeks to cut $3.7 million, or 9 percent, in funding for Elkins' office. His spokeswoman, Jennifer Kaplan, said that would impair the ability of the inspector general to perform investigations like the one into Pruitt's spending. \n \n \"Without sufficient resources, we would not be able to take on many discretionary audits and investigations that the OIG believes yield considerable value and return on investment,\" Kaplan said. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow AP environmental writer Michael Biesecker at http://Twitter.com/mbieseck ||||| EPA's Scott Pruitt flies 1st class to talk Superfund in NH \n \n By MICHAEL COUSINEAU \n \n New Hampshire Union Leader \n \n EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt speaks with the New Hampshire Union Leader in Manchester on Tuesday.

It included first-class seats and a ride on a military jet, the newspaper reported.\u201cI\u2019m not involved in any of those decisions,\u201d Pruitt said in his first interview since the report was published. \u201cThose are all made by the (security) detail, the security assessment in addition to the chief of staff.\u201dPruitt questioned what the Obama administration accomplished environmentally.\u201cEverybody looks at the past administration as being an environmental savior,\u201d Pruitt said.He said 40 percent of the country lived in areas that didn\u2019t meet air quality standards \u2014 covering 120 million Americans.\u201cYou had more sites on the Superfund list when they left office than when they came in,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cNow, I just ask you, objectively: What did they do to improve the environment compared to what we\u2019re doing?\u201dPruitt said he wants to get Superfund sites cleaned up more quickly than past administrations.Tom Irwin, vice president and New Hampshire director of the Conservation Law Foundation, said the Obama and Trump administrations differ on how they view science.\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say the current administration in many ways is outright abandoning science,\u201d Irwin said.Pruitt also met with Gov. Chris Sununu and visited Central Paper in Manchester Tuesday.\u201cWe discussed wide-ranging issues facing New Hampshire, and it is critical that our priorities are heard,\u201d the governor said in a statement. \u201cI was pleased to hear the EPA agreed to expedite the bedrock water table testing to further ensure that the Seacoast\u2019s drinking water has not been contaminated by the Coakley Landfill (in North Hampton).\u201cI am confident that the state, and our towns, will have a positive and productive relationship with the EPA moving forward,\u201d Sununu said.The governor also discussed eradicating lead poisoning in New Hampshire.Licensed forester Charlie Niebling listened to Pruitt at Central Paper.\u201cI liked his matter-of-fact, no-BS approach to his responsibilities,\u201d said Niebling, a partner in the consulting firm Innovative Natural Resource Solutions in Antrim. \u201cI respect the importance of regulatory certainty for the business community.\u201dThe White House plan to cut the EPA budget by 23 percent next fiscal year \u201ccuts a swath through EPA\u2019s personnel and programs in ways that are going to harm the public and public health in the long-term,\u201d said Elgie Holstein, spokesman for the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington.Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, recently said that Pruitt \u201conly represents the special interests. He should be removed immediately,\u201d according to media reports.Asked about the comments, Pruitt said: \u201cThey just don\u2019t know me.\u201d\u201cWhen you look at having an objective, to having better management, oversight, outcomes with respect to Superfunds, how is that a political issue,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cHow is that a bad thing?\u201dPruitt \u2014 who also visited the Mohawk Tannery Superfund site in Nashua \u2014 said he wants his agency to work with industry more than in prior years.\u201cI believe most states, most citizens, most companies, most industry want to protect the air they breathe, the water they drink, and why this agency, the EPA, or any agency would treat them as an adversary is wrong-headed,\u201d Pruitt said.\u201cWe will prosecute bad actors and we have already with the Department of Justice,\u201d he said.\u201cBut here\u2019s the issue: Why do you start from a premise that the industry and those folks are bad actors and not partners to begin with? That\u2019s how you reach bad outcomes as opposed to good outcomes.\u201dIrwin said Pruitt\u2019s comments were based on \u201cthe false assumption this is about attacking certain industries\u201d versus protecting the environment.Pruitt said more work needs to be done to clean up higher-than-allowed levels of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and/or perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) found around Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics site in Merrimack and the Coakley Landfill.\u201cIt is a major concern \u2014 a major concern for me, a major concern for the agency,\u201d Pruitt said.An EPA health advisory dated November 2016 said studies on animals showed that exposure above certain levels \u201cmay result in adverse health effects,\u201d including developmental effects to fetuses during pregnancy as well as certain cancers.mcousineau@unionleader.com \n \n \n \n Politics ||||| EPA on Wednesday retracted its claim that Administrator Scott Pruitt has received a \u201cblanket waiver\u201d to fly first class whenever he travels, after POLITICO pointed officials to federal travel rules that appeared to bar such arrangements. \n \n Pruitt has been routinely flying first class at taxpayers\u2019 expense after securing what EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox had described as \"blanket waiver,\u201d POLITICO reported Tuesday. But the General Services Administration says federal rules require agencies\u2019 oversight staffers to sign off on officials\u2019 first- or business-class travel \"on a trip-by-trip basis ... unless the traveler has an up-to-date documented disability or special need.\u201d \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Wilcox changed his explanation after POLITICO pointed out that section of the regulations. GSA does allow first-class travel for security reasons, but only if agencies request a waiver for each trip. \n \n \"As such, for every trip Administrator Pruitt submits a waiver to fly in either first or business class,\" Wilcox said, amending the agency's earlier statement, which yielded criticism from Republican lawmakers and led Democrats to request an inspector general investigation. \n \n A GSA spokesperson confirmed its ban on blanket waivers to POLITICO Wednesday but would not discuss Pruitt's specific circumstances. \n \n Morning Energy newsletter The source for energy and environment news \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

In fact, the agency has not yet responded to POLITICO's June request information about travel authorizations. \n \n Two House Democrats asked an agency watchdog earlier Wednesday to review EPA's \"blanket waiver\" policy. \n \n The questions add to growing scrutiny over the high-flying travel expenses of President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet, five months after former HHS Secretary Tom Price stepped down following POLITICO\u2019s reporting on his use of more than $1 million in taxpayers\u2019 money for trips on private jets and government planes. \n \n Pruitt and his staff say he can't fly coach because of security concerns. He regularly purchases first-class tickets on trips as short as D.C. to Boston and on long-haul flights to the Middle East. \n \n But Norm Eisen, the former top ethics lawyer for the Obama administration and a critic of Trump, said Pruitt should not be allowed to routinely ignore regulations that are meant to ensure government officials do not waste taxpayer dollars. \n \n \"It\u2019s nonsense, whereas no such thing as providing a blanket waiver of that kind. It\u2019s contrary to all ethics practices,\" Eisen said. \"If you\u2019re going to use the people\u2019s money in this way, there needs to be an individual waiver each time.\" \n \n Information about Pruitt\u2019s travel expenses has come out only in response to specific public records requests, including one that a court ordered EPA to respond to in mid-January from a watchdog group called the Environmental Integrity Project. It\u2019s not possible to tally how much Pruitt has spent on first-class trips in total, but The Washington Post reported over the weekend that in early June, Pruitt and other EPA staff racked up more than $90,000 in travel bills. \n \n Records also show Pruitt spending $1,641 for a flight from D.C. to New York City and back \u2014 a route that often costs as little as $250 with a few days\u2019 notice. \n \n Pruitt also may have an armed agent flying with him at the first-class price level, but EPA excluded some of the travel records in its disclosure to the environmental group, citing security concerns. \n \n Pruitt\u2019s high-priced trips run contrary to the practices of previous administrations, when top EPA officials typically flew coach, and ethics officials allowed first-class trips only in special circumstances. Staffers for President Barack Obama\u2019s EPA chief, Gina McCarthy, recall her flying coach to and from Africa and Asia. \n \n Some Republican lawmakers have criticized Pruitt\u2019s flights, adding to angst over other Trump officials\u2019 travel practices. Besides Price, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin have been under scrutiny for their expenses. \n \n Eisen, now chairman of the liberal watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said that when he was working in the White House from 2011 to 2014 he only rarely allowed non-coach travel, when State Department officials had to make flights of 14 hours or more. Trips of that length justify first-class tickets, according to federal regulations. \n \n GSA rules clearly prohibit blanket authorizations for commercial flights in virtually all circumstances. \n \n \u201cBlanket authorization of other than coach-class transportation accommodations is prohibited and shall be authorized on an individual trip-by-trip basis, unless the traveler has an up-to-date documented disability or special need,\u201d the Federal Travel Regulation says. \n \n However, agencies can apply waivers to use government aircraft, in certain situations. \n \n Other former federal officials speaking on background said they'd also never heard of a blanket waiver. \n \n An advance staffer for an Obama-era Cabinet member said first class didn\u2019t seem to offer security benefits. \n \n \u201cSecurity [staff], in my experience, doesn\u2019t care so much what cabin the principal sits in,\" the former advance staffer said. \"They care much more about where their seat is in the plane.\" \n \n EPA's Office of Inspector General, which investigates threats against Pruitt, said last fall that he received up to five times as many threats as his immediate predecessor, McCarthy. \n \n It is not clear how many of those threats have been deemed credible; the instances revealed so far have included threatening tweets and a menacing postcard. The internal watchdog did not immediately respond to a request on Wednesday for updated statistics on threats against Pruitt. \n \n A former TSA official noted that everyone who flies, in coach or otherwise, is subject to security screening. \n \n \"Everyone in that aircraft went through TSA security screening,\" the official said. \"It\u2019s a safe environment like you\u2019d go through the Capitol building on Capitol Hill. Everyone has gone through a metal detector, same as on an aircraft.\" \n \n Other security experts told POLITICO that there are genuine protective advantages to traveling in first class. \n \n Airlines will often work with high-profile travelers to board them separately from the general public. Flying first class also grants access to secured lounge areas, and first-class passengers disembark first. And while in the air, the first-class area is more tightly controlled than coach. \n \n \u201cYou want to minimize as much potential problems as you can,\u201d said Joe Funk of TorchStone Global, a private security firm. Funk spent 21 years in the Secret Service and more recently provided security for presidential candidates Obama, Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush. \n \n \u201cIf you reduce the exposure of your protectee, your VIP, from the entire airport audience to a smaller group that is in the lounges, you\u2019ve eliminated or minimized\u201d threats, he added. \n \n While flying first class could allow Pruitt access to special lounges where there are fewer passengers waiting for a plane, former federal agency staffers say VIPs are often offered that option even with just a coach ticket. Some airports ask high-level officials to disembark directly to their vehicles rather than walking through the terminal, a former EPA staffer said. And armed guards and the people they are protecting typically board planes first, former government employees familiar with the process said. \n \n \u201cAs much as you can keep your principal away from other people,\u201d you should, said John Sexton of Sexton Executive Security in Fairfax, Va.",

Pruitt's government-funded travel is being reviewed by the EPA's internal watchdog, which says the results of its investigation should be released by the summer, the AP reports. Earlier this week, EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox claimed Pruitt had a \"blanket waiver\" allowing him to choose first class whenever he travels, but he retracted the statement after Politico pointed out that federal rules require a waiver for every taxpayer-funded first-class trip when it's for security reasons. Wilcox, whose earlier statement was criticized by both Democrats and Republicans, now says Pruitt \"submits a waiver to fly in either first or business class\" for every trip he makes.

    "document": "Image caption Kolkata zoo has three white tigers, including two females \n \n Officials at the Alipore zoo in the Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta) say their attempts to mate a young tiger have been unsuccessful with the big cat showing little interest in mating. \n \n Vishal, the 10-year-old white tiger, has so far spurned the advances of tigress Rupa, living in the adjoining enclosure, an official told the BBC. \n \n Libido enhancers have also failed to spur him into action, he said. \n \n Experts blame his \"shyness\" on the fact that Vishal has been bred in captivity. \n \n \"For the past six months we've been trying to mate Vishal,\" Dayanarayan Banerjee, who retired as the senior veterinary officer at the zoo and is now working as a veterinary consultant there, told the BBC. \n \n \"We have de-wormed him to improve his overall health. We have given him libido enhancers, including vitamin D, A and E. But he is shy and no libido has been noticed in him,\" he said. \n \n Mr Banerjee says this is the first time an attempt has been made to mate Vishal - the only male in the breeding age in the zoo - but perhaps he is a bit too old to mate. \n \n \"The most suitable age for a tiger to mate is when he is five-six years old. Seven-eight-year-olds also succeed. But beyond the age of 10 years, it is very difficult.\" \n \n Mr Banerjee said when Vishal was introduced to eight-year-old Rupa, he was \"friendly enough\" and \"displayed no sign of hostility\", but that's where the contact ended. \n \n \"Rupa was willing, but Vishal was reluctant,\" he added. \n \n Mr Banerjee says he is \"not sure Vishal will deliver\" but zoo authorities are not yet giving up on the exercise. \n \n \"We are considering introducing him to Rani, she is a Bengal tigress, and she has a very beautiful face. But she is in an enclosure that's far away from Vishal's and we are awaiting a decision on whether we can move her to a nearby enclosure.\" ||||| Zeeshan Jawed \n \n \n \n KOLKATA: His intimidating roar terrifies humans but his partner's mating call breaks him into a cold sweat. Officials at Alipore zoo are faced with a rather strange situation where one of their young male tigers is showing little or no interest in mating despite several not-so-subtle hints dropped by his female partner. No amount of aphrodisiac or libido stimulant has been successful in making him, er, rise to the occasion. Vishal and Rupa are the young white tiger couple in this much-anticipated captive breeding project. Alipore zoo has five tigresses and only three tigers. Vishal and Rupa, aged 10 and eight, were selected for their youth and vigour after the State Zoo Authority gave permission to resume captive breeding last year. But Vishal's performance \u2014 or the lack of it \u2014 has come as a major downer. \"We chose Vishal because he is the youngest and physically the most well-built among the male tigers. But we cannot understand what happens to him when he sees Rupa. He runs away with his tail between his legs,\" said Dayanarayan Banerjee, senior veterinary officer at the zoo. Medical officers and zoo keepers who have been closely monitoring the behaviour of the tiger and the tigress, said that when Rupa enters her oestrus cycle \u2014 a period of \"heat\" when she is sexually receptive and makes advances \u2014 Vishal shows zero interest. \"Once Rupa enters her oestrus cycle, she makes mating calls and tries to get close to Vishal. She scratches his back with her nails, tries to make physical contact and even chases him. But Vishal runs in the opposite direction,\" said Banerjee. After noticing his indifference, medical officers administered vitamins A and E last year to enhance Vishal's sexual appetite. When that did not get his blood thumping, the doctors administered a libido enhancer but even that did not lift Vishal's mood. \"None of it worked. Vishal kept snubbing Rupa's advances,\" said a zoo official. Perplexed, zoo authorities consulted experienced veterinary officers and specialists who attributed his demeanour to shyness due to captivity and not necessarily to lack of virility. \"Vishal has grown up in captivity due to which he has never interacted with the opposite sex earlier. He is shy and often unable to understand the biological signals his body is giving him,\" said a big cat specialist in the forest and wildlife department. The breeding of tigers in the zoo is very important for several reasons, say veterinary officers. \"Mating is a biological need of any living being and it is required to stay healthy. Second, the big cats in the zoo are not getting any younger. If we want a younger generation of tigers here in the years to come, we have to work on it right now,\" said Banerjee. The last time a tiger cub was bred in the zoo was more than a decade ago. Though several big cats were young at that time and ready to procreate, senior officials in the wildlife department were not willing to take any risk lest the tigers injure each other during the mating. When some officials have taken the initiative now, the age and the attitude of the tigers does not permit that. \"Tigers can be ferocious during mating. They may harm their partner if they get over excited or angry about something. Most of the directors over the last decade did not want to take any risk and kept postponing the mating process,\" said a senior official in the department. The breeding of tigers has become a challenge for zoo officials who have otherwise achieved major successes with giraffes, zebras, macaws and barking deer. \"We have a good mix of these animals where the young ones are regularly spawning. In case of lions and tigers we do not have the same advantage because most of them are past their prime,\" said Kanai Lal Ghosh, director of Alipore zoo. The zoo authorities aren't about to give up on Vishal yet \u2014 maybe a much younger tigress will get his mojo working. Officials are toying with the idea of setting up Vishal with the much nubile Rani. \"She is young and full of vigour. We are hoping she will succeed in enticing Vishal,\" said a veterinary officer. The question is will Vishal rise to the occasion this time? \n \n",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Male tigers are a lot like human men when it comes to sex. They're shy and awkward about their bodies if they haven't spent a lot of time around female tigers. They take libido enhancers when they get older. And, if a partner their own age isn't doing it for them, they consider trading them in for a younger, prettier tiger. BBC News reports India's Alipore zoo is having a difficult time getting its 10-year-old white tiger Vishal to mate. The zoo has tried vitamins and even de-worming him; nothing seems to be working. Experts are blaming the fact that Vishal was born in captivity, meaning he doesn't have much experience with females and might not understand the biological signals his body is sending, according to the Times of India. Plus, Vishal is at the outer limits of breeding age for tigers. This is apparently frustrating to Rupa, a female white tiger the zoo has assigned to breed with Vishal. While in heat, Rupa will chase, touch, and scratch Vishal, but he \"runs away with his tail between his legs,\" a veterinary consultant tells the Times. Zoo staff have been trying to mate the two tigers for six months, and it's important they succeed because the zoo's tiger population is getting older and hasn't had a birth in more than a decade. Now, staff are considering trying Vishal out with a much younger Bengal tiger named Rani, who is described as having \"a very beautiful face,\" the BBC reports. Ouch, Rupa.",

Holder arrived in... (Associated Press) \n \n On a visit to the St. Louis suburb that has endured more than a week of unrest, Holder sought to build confidence in the investigation into the death of the black 18-year-old who was shot by a white officer. The trip also underscored the priority to the Obama administration of civil rights in general and the Michael Brown case in particular. \n \n The attorney general said Wednesday that he understands why many black Americans do not trust police and that he has experienced many of the same frustrations. He described being stopped twice on the New Jersey Turnpike and accused of speeding. Police searched his car, looking through the trunk and under the seats. \n \n \"I remember how humiliating that was and how angry I was and the impact it had on me,\" Holder said during a meeting with about 50 community leaders at the Florissant campus of St. Louis Community College. \n \n Once while living in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, Holder was running to catch a movie with his cousin when a squad car rolled up and flashed its lights at the pair. The officer yelled, \"Where are you going? Hold it!\" Holder recalled. \n \n His cousin \"started mouthing off,\" and Holder urged him to be quiet. \n \n \"We negotiate the whole thing, and we walk to our movie. At the time that he stopped me, I was a federal prosecutor. I wasn't a kid,\" he said. \n \n Holder also met with federal officials investigating Brown's Aug. 9 death and with Brown's parents. Before getting briefed at the local FBI headquarters, he said he hoped the visit would \"have a calming influence\" on the area. \n \n In addition, the attorney general met briefly with Missouri State Highway Patrol Capt. Ron Johnson, who has been in charge of security in Ferguson for nearly a week. The National Guard is also helping to keep the peace. \n \n Asked whether he had confidence in the local investigation of the police officer, Johnson said Holder's presence \"is a guarantee on that.\" \n \n In nearby Clayton, a grand jury began hearing evidence to determine whether the officer, Darren Wilson, should be charged in Brown's death. A spokesman for St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch said there was no timeline for the process, but it could take weeks. \n \n Outside the St. Louis County Justice Center, where the grand jury convened, two dozen protesters gathered in a circle for a prayer, chanted and held signs urging McCulloch to step aside. \n \n McCulloch's deep family connections to police have been cited by some black leaders who question his ability to be impartial in the case. McCulloch's father, mother, brother, uncle and cousin all worked for the St. Louis Police Department, and his father was killed while responding to a call involving a black suspect. \n \n The prosecutor, who is white, has insisted his background will have no bearing on the handling of the Brown case, which has touched off days of protests that have sometimes turned violent at night, when authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear the streets. \n \n On Wednesday, police said an officer had been suspended for pointing a semi-automatic assault rifle at demonstrators, then cursing and threatening to kill one of them. A protester captured the exchange on video Tuesday and posted it to YouTube and other websites. \n \n Some protesters returned to the streets Wednesday evening but in diminished numbers. They marched around a single block as a thunderstorm filled the sky with lightning and dumped rain. Police still stood guard, but many wore regular uniforms rather than riot gear. \n \n Johnson said there were six arrests, compared to 47 the previous night, and called it \"a very good night.\" Johnson also said the visit by Holder let people know their voices had been heard. \n \n The Justice Department has mounted an unusually swift and aggressive response to Brown's death, conducting an independent autopsy and sending dozens of FBI agents to Ferguson in search of witnesses to the shooting. \n \n Brown's funeral is set for Monday in St. Louis. His uncle, the Rev. Charles Ewing, will deliver the eulogy. The Rev. Al Sharpton will also speak. Brown will be buried at St. Peter's Cemetery in St. Louis County. \n \n Holder said the Obama administration has been working to achieve change through the Justice Department's civil rights division. \n \n \"The same kid who got stopped on the New Jersey freeway is now the attorney general of the United States,\" he added. \"This country is capable of change. But change doesn't happen by itself.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Jim Salter in St. Louis, David A. Lieb in Jefferson City and Nigel Duara in Ferguson contributed to this report.",

The militants sprayed gunfire into the crowds of people at a busy market that is open at night when temperatures cool in the semi-desert region, reported ThisDay newspaper. \n \n Nigerian federal Senator Ahmed Zannah said the attack lasted about 12 hours, according to the newspaper. The insurgents set homes on fire and gunned down residents who tried to escape from the flames, reported the paper. \n \n Zannah blamed fighters of Nigeria's homegrown Boko Haram terrorist network that has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping of 276 teenage girls and is threatening to sell them into slavery. \n \n Boko Haram's five-year-old Islamic uprising has claimed the lives of thousands of Muslims and Christians. More than 1,500 people have died in their attacks so far this year.

Many sought safe haven in nearby Cameroon, they said. \n \n The fighters also attacked the police station during the 12-hour assault, initially facing stiff resistance. They eventually used explosives to blow the roof off the building, witnesses said. Fourteen police officers were found dead inside, they said. \n \n The final death toll could be closer to 300, Nigerian Sen.

The #BringBackOurGirls campaign initially began on Twitter.

At least eight girls between the ages of 12 and 15 were snatched Sunday night from the village of Warabe by Boko Haram, villagers said. \n \n \"The President and the government (are) not taking this as easy as people all over the world think,\" presidential spokesman Doyin Okupe said, adding that helicopters and airplanes have searched for the girls in 250 locations. More troops, he said, are on the way. \n \n Despite the flurry of activity, the father of two of the schoolgirls taken by Boko Haram scoffed at the Nigerian government's response. \n \n \"We have never seen any military man there,\" said the father, who is not being identified for fear of reprisals by the government or Boko Haram. \n \n \"Had it been military men who went into the bush to rescue our daughters, we would have seen them.\" \n \n Members of the U.S. Congress called for action, former U.N.

The video was first obtained Monday by Agence-France Presse. \n \n \"I abducted your girls. I will sell them in the market, by Allah,\" he said. \"There is a market for selling humans.

Johnson will serve 30 days in jail after violating probation in a domestic violence... (Associated Press) \n \n Johnson, known as Chad Ochocinco for his jersey number in Spanish during his playing days, had reached a deal with prosecutors calling for community service and counseling instead of jail. Broward County Circuit Judge Kathleen McHugh said she would tack on an additional three months' probation because Johnson had failed to meet with his probation officer during three previous months. \n \n It was all set until Johnson, when asked by McHugh if he was satisfied with his lawyer Adam Swickle, gave the attorney a light swat on the rear _ as football players routinely do to each other on the field. The courtroom erupted in laughter and at that McHugh said she wouldn't accept the deal. \n \n \"I don't know that you're taking this whole thing seriously. I just saw you slap your attorney on the backside. Is there something funny about this?\" McHugh said, slapping the plea deal document down on her desk. \"The whole courtroom was laughing. I'm not going to accept these plea negotiations. This isn't a joke.\" \n \n Johnson, 35, tried to apologize and insisted he meant no disrespect. Johnson was on probation after pleading no contest to head-butting his then-wife, TV reality star Evelyn Lozada, during an altercation last August. She quickly filed for divorce after barely a month of marriage and Johnson, a six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver, was immediately released by the Miami Dolphins. He didn't play at all last season. \n \n \"This is your courtroom. I have no intent to make this a joke. It's not funny,\" Johnson told the judge \"My life is in a shambles right now and I try my best to laugh and keep a smile on my face.\" \n \n But McHugh, who could have given Johnson up to a year in jail, was not moved. \n \n \"It's not the first time he's behaved that way in my courtroom,\" she said. \n \n Johnson then was handcuffed and hauled away to jail. Swickle declined comment on whether he would seek a reduced sentence. \n \n Johnson has been undergoing therapy aimed at helping people involved in domestic violence but has not signed with another NFL team. He said in court Monday he hoped that would change in the upcoming football season, but now faces another setback. \n \n \"He has suffered. He has lost everything,\" Swickle told the judge. \n \n Johnson, whose best playing days were with the Cincinnati Bengals, caught 766 passes for more than 11,000 yards and 67 touchdowns during his career. He also played for the New England Patriots. \n \n Lozada stars on VH-1's\"Basketball Wives\" TV show. She was previously engaged to ex-NBA star Antoine Walker, who played for the Miami Heat, Boston Celtics and other teams, and was a star on the University of Kentucky's 1996 national championship team. \n \n _____ \n \n Follow Curt Anderson on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Miamicurt",

    "document": "Reuters Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen talks at a news conference Wednesday following the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. \n \n WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) \u2014 Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen spoke for an hour at her press conference Wednesday, but the market only heard three words: \u201caround six months.\u201d \n \n She was asked how long the Fed would wait after the tapering ends before it begins to raise interest rates. \n \n Her answer: \u201cSo the language that we used in the statement is \u2018considerable period.\u2019 So I, you know, this is the kind of term it\u2019s hard to define. But, you know, probably means something on the order of around six months, that type of thing.\u201d \n \n Hilsenrath: Fed tweaks rate guidance (5:51) Jon Hilsenrath joins the News Hub with analysis of the Federal Reserve's move to alter its guidance on the likely path of interest rates, putting less weight on the unemployment rate as a signpost for when rate increases will start. Photo: Getty Images. \n \n She added lots of qualifiers to that, including the assessment of the labor market and the inflation outlook, but the markets only heard \u201caround six months.\u201d Markets sold off. \n \n The taper of the Fed\u2019s bond purchases is on course to end in October or November. Six months after that would be April or May. So Yellen said the first rate hike could come in April or May, depending on how the economy is doing. \n \n Before this Fed meeting, the market had been expecting the first rate hike to come toward the end of 2015, perhaps in October or December. The updated forecasts provided by the Fed\u2019s \u201cdot plot\u201d would point to a first rate hike in September or October of 2015, just a little faster than the market had been expecting. \n \n Now we\u2019ve heard from the Fed chair that the first hike could \u2014 emphasize could \u2014 come two or three meetings before that. \n \n Listen to What a 2015 rate hike would mean to you. \n \n Did Yellen mean to be that specific? No, the Fed has always loosely defined \u201cconsiderable period\u201d as about half a year. It\u2019s supposed to be a little vague. She probably didn\u2019t intend to give any hints about timing beyond what the \u201cdot plot\u201d said. No Fed chair is going to confidently tell markets that it\u2019s going to raise rates in 14 months. \n \n But now that she\u2019s leading the Fed, the markets will react to what she said, not what she means. \n \n Now it\u2019s up to Yellen and her colleagues to walk this back, if they don\u2019t like what the market heard. \n \n Also read these MarketWatch stories: \n \n Stocks drop after FOMC \n \n Fed shifts criteria for rate hike and market sours ||||| Communication \n \n Janet Yellen may have just committed the first substantial blunder of her chairmanship of the Federal Reserve. The mistake: being specific when the occasion called for generality. \u201cThe more experienced [Ben] Bernanke knew to avoid clarifying deliberately vague statement language,\u201d Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase, wrote in a client note after the financial markets reacted badly. \n \n Investors are dying to know when the Federal Reserve will start raising its target for the federal funds rate, which has been stuck on the floor at zero percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008. The Fed has repeatedly refused to be pinned down. In its statement today, for example, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) said \u201cit likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends [emphasis added].\u201d \n \n At her first press conference since becoming Fed chair in February, Yellen was asked what the Fed meant by \u201ca considerable time.\u201d The correct answer to this question is, \u201cWe weren\u2019t specific for a reason. Go away.\u201d Yellen, having been connected with the Fed in one capacity or another for most of the past 20 years, should have known that. Instead, she said, \u201cYou know, this is the kind of term it\u2019s hard to define, but, you know, it probably means something on the order of around six months or that type of thing.\u201d That was a bit quicker than markets had been expecting, so interest rates rose and stocks fell. The comment \u201csent equity markets into something of a tailspin,\u201d wrote Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics. \n \n Michael Wallace of Action Economics in Colorado called Yellen\u2019s specificity a \u201cgaffe.\u201d He wrote that Yellen made \u201cthe mistake of \ufffd?taking the bait\u2019 and providing a time reference for the purposefully ambiguous phrase.\u201d It wasn\u2019t the only factor in the market selloff today\u2014new economic projections by members of the FOMC were also a factor\u2014but it did make a difference. \n \n It\u2019s a fair bet that other FOMC members will be suggesting to Yellen that she stick closer to the script next time she addresses reporters. ||||| There is good reason to hope that Janet Yellen may go on to become one of the great leaders of the Federal Reserve: she\u2019s a first-rate economist, a gifted explicator of complicated concepts, and an experienced hand at navigating Washington. (At her first appearance as Fed chief on Capitol Hill, last month, the Republican senators may not have been eating out of her hands, but they treated her with unusual deference.) In policy terms, she\u2019s on the side of the angels: passionately committed to getting the economy growing and bringing down unemployment, particularly for the long-term jobless, who have been the biggest victims of the Great Recession and its aftermath. \n \n On Wednesday, though, at her first press conference as chairwoman of the Fed, Yellen had an awkward time, conveying a message that she may well not have intended to, and spooking the markets. This may not be a big deal: Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke made similar errors in their early days and quickly recovered. But it did indicate some of the challenges Yellen faces in extricating the Fed from the emergency policy actions it has taken during the past five years. \n \n Her first task was to explain a U-turn in the Fed\u2019s communications strategy. In December, 2012, in an effort to keep down long-term interest rates, particularly mortgage rates, the Federal Open Market Committee, a policy-making body that Yellen heads, publicly stated that it wouldn\u2019t even consider raising the short-term interest rate that it sets\u2014the federal funds rate\u2014until the unemployment rate had fallen to 6.5 per cent. At the time, the jobless rate was 7.8 per cent, and the 6.5-per-cent threshold for a possible interest-rate hike seemed a long way off. But unemployment has fallen rapidly in the past year, and the rate is now down to 6.7 per cent. The markets wanted to know what the Fed would do if it reached 6.5 per cent. \n \n Yellen\u2019s answer today was that it almost certainly wouldn\u2019t do anything, but we\u2019d have to trust the judgment of her and her colleagues on it. In place of its firm \u201cforward guidance\u201d regarding the 6.5-per-cent figure, the F.O.M.C. said, in a statement, that its assessment of when to start raising rates would \u201ctake into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.\u201d The statement also said that the committee believed that it would be appropriate to maintain its rock-bottom target for the funds rate (between zero and a quarter of one per cent) for \u201ca considerable time\u201d after its policy of quantitative easing\u2014printing money to buy bonds\u2014ends, which, at the current pace of drawdown, is likely to happen in October. \n \n This change in language wasn\u2019t wholly unexpected. However, it caused some confusion. Like most other observers, I initially read it as a dovish document: it appeared to be designed to give Yellen and her colleagues the leeway to keep the funds rate low even well beyond the date when the unemployment rate drops below 6.5 per cent. But the bond markets reacted differently. There was a significant sell-off after the statement was released, and market interest rates rose\u2014indicating a belief among investors that an early rise in the funds rate was more, and not less, likely. \n \n So what, you might say: markets are always bouncing around, and they usually settle down eventually. That\u2019s true, but it matters a great deal to the Fed how investors on Wall Street, and in other financial markets around the globe, interpret its public statements. These days, the primary way that monetary policy works is by influencing expectations about future changes in policy. If bond-market investors believe that a rise in the funds rate is likely to come earlier than they had been expecting, they will be apt to sell now. That can cause an immediate tightening in monetary conditions, which can hit the housing market and other interest-sensitive sectors of the economy. Last summer, Bernanke inadvertently caused a substantial rise in mortgage rates by appearing to suggest that the Fed was already intent on drawing down its asset purchases. \n \n During her press conference, Yellen got the opportunity to explain what the statement really meant, but instead of clarifying the situation she made it worse. She started out well enough, stressing that the change in wording didn\u2019t mean that the policy stance had changed in any way. Issuing forward guidance had served a useful purpose, she insisted. But, as the unemployment rate had fallen faster than expected, it had created uncertainty about what would happen when the threshold was reached. That\u2019s why she and her colleagues had decided to drop the 6.5-per-cent figure and replace it with the \u201cqualitative guidance\u201d that the Fed would consider a much wider range of metrics than simply the unemployment rate. Yellen also pointed to the bit in the statement about keeping rates constant for \u201ca considerable time\u201d after the policy of quantitative easing ends. \n \n That\u2019s where she got into trouble. Ann Saphir, a Reuters reporter, bluntly asked her how long the gap would be between the end of the Fed\u2019s asset purchases and the first interest-rate hike. A more experienced central-bank head would have obfuscated and said something vague: policymakers generally believe it is imperative to leave themselves some discretion. But Yellen again referred to the phrase \u201cconsiderable period,\u201d saying, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to define but, you know, probably means something on the order of around six months.\u201d \n \n To this viewer, it sounded like an offhand comment, but that wasn\u2019t how the markets interpreted it. Six months from October is next April\u2014about a year away. Wall Street hadn\u2019t been expecting a rate change until the second half of 2015 at the earliest. Yellen, inadvertently or not, had changed the timetable\u2014or so it seemed. The stock market, which had recovered a bit after the release of the Fed statement, immediately gapped down. The Dow, which was down about forty points, fell another hundred and fifty points. In the bond markets and the futures markets, prices shifted sharply to reflect the increased likelihood of an interest-rate rise in the spring of next year. \n \n Yellen, although she couldn\u2019t have known of the market reaction, appeared to realize that she had erred. Any decision to raise rates, she stressed, would depend \u201con what conditions are like\u201d at the time. She and her colleagues would look at how fast the labor market was moving toward full employment, and whether the inflation rate, which has been dangerously low the past couple of years, was moving back toward the Fed\u2019s two-per-cent target. If inflation was persistently running below the target, that would be a good reason to keep the federal funds rate where it was, she added. \n \n These were excellent points, and they added to my impression that Yellen has no intention of raising interest rates until she is entirely convinced that the economy is finally growing normally, or something very close to it. Unfortunately, though, the communications error had been made. On the newswires and on Wall Street, the message was that the Fed is getting ready to start raising rates, not immediately, but within a year or so. Traders had already seized upon a set of economic projections released alongside the F.O.M.C. statement, which appeared to indicate that some members of the committee had slightly raised their interest-rate forecasts since their previous meeting. Yellen, in her answers, tried to downplay these projections, saying that people should focus on the statement itself. But it all added to the selling pressure in the markets. \n \n Once again, this is not the end of the world, and Yellen didn\u2019t do anything wrong. To the contrary, she delivered a cogent and persuasive explanation of why the Fed\u2019s ultra-accommodative interest-rate polices need to be maintained for a considerable time to come: inflation is too low, and there\u2019s lots of slack left in the labor market. But she allowed her message to be garbled, which is something she\u2019ll have to address going forward. \n \n With the gradual pickup in the economy and the drawing down of quantitative easing, Wall Street\u2019s attention is beginning to focus on the eventual normalization of interest-rate policy, and what impact that will have on the markets. An inflection point in policy is a tricky time to be Fed chairman. There\u2019s always a lot of uncertainty\u2014and provisional statements, which are heavily qualified, can be seized upon as firm expressions of policy. Bernanke had his troubles with this last year; it looks like Yellen may experience some of the same problems. Welcome to the hot seat, Madame Chair. \n \n Photograph by Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg/Getty. ||||| It wasn't the debut Janet Yellen had hoped for. During her first press conference as Federal Reserve chairman, she said something she almost certainly hadn't meant to, and the markets took it badly. The misunderstanding was more their fault than hers. Even so, it's yet another illustration of the perils of forward guidance. \n \n Yellen was asked how long the Fed expected to wait before starting to raise interest rates once it has brought quantitative easing to an end: What did the official formula of \"a considerable period\" mean? She said, \"It's hard to define but, you know, it probably means something on the order of around six months or that type of thing.\" \n \n The markets seized on this as actionable information. At the present rate of tapering, QE will end in October. Add six months and you get to next spring. Previously markets had expected rates to start rising a few months later than that. So Yellen was judged to be tightening policy, stock prices fell and bond yields rose. \n \n That was a remarkably dumb conclusion for investors to draw from a press conference that had otherwise been at pains to say that the expected policy track was unchanged. Aside from the six months comment, Yellen gave no indication whatever that the Fed intended to tighten policy, relative to what the markets were expecting. \n \n What she should have said when asked what \"a considerable period\" meant was, \"It's hard to be more precise; it all depends on what happens.\" After all, the Fed has explicitly moved away from attaching dates to information about its policy intentions, preferring to say that policy will be guided by conditions. The length of the considerable period will depend on conditions. Enough said. \n \n The fallacy about forward guidance that repeatedly tripped up Ben Bernanke, Yellen's predecessor, and caused her to stumble at her first outing is the idea that more information -- more words, more numbers, whatever -- must be good. No. \n \n It's valuable to be told that the Fed will keep interest rates very low while there is still some slack in the labor market, inflation is suppressed, and market expectations of inflation are well-anchored. Yellen said all that. It's also valuable to be told that the Fed will consider a range of indicators in judging labor market conditions -- as opposed to relying solely on a numerical threshold for the unemployment rate (which the Fed has now rightly dropped from its guidance). She said that too. But since the Fed doesn't have a fixed formula for labor market slack -- that's a judgment call -- there's really nothing more to be said. \n \n Nothing useful, I mean. Investors always want more information, but they're not always good at sifting useful information from noise. The Fed could help them by recognizing that sometimes less is more. \n \n (Clive Crook is a member of the Bloomberg View editorial board.

Half of them have died. \n \n Also in its Thursday update, the WHO appeared to have given the novel coronavirus a name: Middle East respiratory symptom coronavirus, or MERS-CoV. \n \n A 23rd death was reported Tuesday, when a French hospital and the French government reported a man diagnosed with the coronavirus had died of organ failure. \n \n The patient, the first of two people to be diagnosed with novel coronavirus, died at University Hospital of Lille, where he had been treated since May 9. \n \n The man contracted the virus while visiting the Arabian Peninsula, said Marisol Touraine, France's minister of social affairs and health, in a statement. \n \n The second patient, also male, was in stable but very serious condition, the hospital said. One of the patients shared a room with the other and contracted the virus. \n \n Joint WHO missions with Saudi Arabia and Tunisia will take place as soon as possible, with the goal of gathering the facts needed to conduct a risk assessment, Chan said Monday. \n \n Earlier this month, the WHO said two health care workers in Saudi Arabia became ill while treating patients. \n \n Novel coronavirus acts like a cold virus and attacks the respiratory system, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said. But symptoms, which include fever and a cough, are severe and can lead to pneumonia and kidney failure. Gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea have also been seen, according to the WHO. \n \n It's not yet known how humans contract the virus, experts have said. Most of the cases so far have been seen in older men with other medical conditions; precise numbers are hard to come by, as officials don't know how many people might contract a mild form. \n \n Cases have been identified in eight countries including France and Saudi Arabia, according to the WHO. Other European countries include Germany and the United Kingdom.",

    "document": "LUCKNOW: At least half-a-dozen newly-wed brides belonging to both Hindu and Muslim communities in Kushinagar district of Uttar Pradesh have raised the banner of revolt against their in-laws over lack of toilets in their household. The newly-wed brides have also returned to their parents' house barely within a couple of weeks of their marriage and are adamant not to go back (to their husbands' place) until toilets are built. \n \n However, these girls can draw solace from the fact that Sulabh International has decided to redress their grievances, and would be constructing toilets in the said households. According to reports emanating from Kushinagar; Neelam, Kalawati, Shakina, Niranjan, Gudiya and Sita of Khesiya village of Kushinagar protested against their husbands and in-laws when they found that there were no toilets in their houses. After spending couple of days, they returned to their father's home. \n \n After getting this news, Sulabh founder Bindeshwar Pathak announced that toilets will be built at all the six household, where the newly-wed brides have raised the banner of revolt. Reacting to the development, Pathak termed the revolt by these brides as a bold and extraordinary. He said, \"Such kind of rising incidents clearly show the changing mindset of girls over toilets. Now everybody is realising the importance of toilets.\" \n \n He further added that the toilets would be constructed by Sulabh International free of cost without any delay, so that they (newly-wed brides) can return to their in-laws' place soon. They will also be honoured for their bold stand, he informed. \n \n Earlier,a bride of UP's Maharajganj district, Priyanka Bharti, was honoured for taking bold steps for construction of a toilet in her in-laws' house. Now she works as a Sulabh motivator and also appeared with a Bollywood actress in a sanitation advertisement. \"Priyanka motivated other women of her village to persuade their partners to build toilets in Maharajganj district,\" Pathak pointed out. \n \n According to a World Bank report, lack of toilets and other proper sanitation costs India nearly $54 billion a year through hygiene-related illnesses, loss of productivity and a host of other problems. The menace is especially acute in rural areas, where women suffer the most due to lack of toilets. \n \n \"Women have to wait for darkness for the sake of privacy before attending to the call of nature. They have to leave before sunrise or wait for the sun to go down,\" Dr Pathak said, adding that a UN study in 2010 found more people in India have access to a mobile phone than to a toilet. \n \n As Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged parliamentarians and the corporate sector to help build separate toilets for girls in schools, Pathak hoped India will become an open defecation free country soon. \n \n \"For the first time in the country's history, the issue of toilet for girls found mention in the speech of any prime minister,\" he said. Speaking from the ramparts of the Red Fort, the PM urged all parliamentarians to invest their MPLAD funds for building toilets in every school. ||||| Image caption The women said they would return only after their husbands had built proper toilets at home \n \n Six newlywed women in a village in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh have returned to their parents because their husbands' homes had no toilets. \n \n The women, all from Khesiya village in Kushinagar district, said they would return only after their husbands had built proper toilets at home. \n \n Nearly half of India's 1.2 billion people have no toilets at home. \n \n Campaigners say the problem is acute in rural India and it is the women who suffer most. \n \n One of the brides, Gudiya, told BBC Hindi that it was very troublesome to go to the fields. \n \n \"My parents have a toilet at home, but there is no toilet in my husband Ramesh Sharma's home. Going outdoors was a big hassle, so I fought with him and returned to my parents.\" \n \n Neelam Sharma, Sakina, Seeta, Nazrum Nisa and Kalavati are the others who have left their marital homes for the same reason. \n \n Ashima Parveen, who lives in Khesiya village, said all six women had wed in the past year or 18 months. \n \n \"In villages, it is not easy for a new bride to step out of her home because here people believe in the purdah [covering the face with a veil]. In this weather when it's raining and there is water logging everywhere, it gets very difficult for these women to go out to the fields.\" \n \n A lack of toilets also exposes women to a risk of attack. \n \n In his Independence Day speech last Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to end open defecation. \n \n \"We are in the 21st Century and yet there is still no dignity for women as they have to go out in the open to defecate and they have to wait for darkness to fall,\" he said. \n \n \"Can you imagine the number of problems they have to face because of this?\" he asked.",

The six returned to their parents' homes in protest and vow not to go back until their in-laws get proper plumbing.

The UN recently warned about the widespread problem of open defecation in poor areas, and India's prime minister vowed last week to tackle the issue, notes the BBC. \"We are in the 21st century and yet there is still no dignity for women as they have to go out in the open to defecate and they have to wait for darkness to fall,\" said Narendra Modi in his speech. It's not just a sanitary issue, either. The gang rape of two teen cousins in India earlier this year occurred when they went to fields near their homes in the evening. A group called Sulabh International has promised to install toilets for the six newlyweds at no cost, with its founder hailing \"the changing mindset\" in the country.

We found more skeletal parts, including a femur with trauma around the knee which we believe to stem from a sharp-edged weapon,\u201d says maritime archaeologist Rolf Fabricius Warming, who is one of the researchers involved in the investigation. \n \n \u201cWe also found large guns and a hand grenade. We can see from the wreckage that it was a very intense and tough battle. Between 800 and 1,000 men were on board. That is comparable to the population of an entire medium-sized town at the time. Most of them died in the explosion or when the ship sank into the watery depths,\u201d he says. \n \n Read More: Researchers discover remains of sunken Swedish warship \n \n The ship contained silver treasure \n \n Researchers had previously discovered silver treasure among the Mars wreckage. This time, one of the most spectacular finds was a large grapnel (grappling hook) an anchor-like hook, which hung from the bowsprits of warships and was used to cling onto another ships in order to board it. \n \n Grapnels are illustrated in historical sources from the 16th century, but no actual surviving examples are known apart from this particular one, says Warming. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s totally unique. Together with other exciting finds, it can shed new light on Medieval and Early Modern naval warfare. ,\u201d he says, and adds that the divers also found remains of possible arms and armour, including helmets and swords. \n \n Read More: The Viking\u2019s grave and the sunken ship \n \n Danish and L\u00fcbeckian soldiers were on board \n \n Mars sunk due to a gunpowder explosion at the front of the ship. But shortly before, it had been under attack by Danish and L\u00fcbeckian warships according to written sources. \n \n \u201cSoldiers fought with hand grenades, lances, and spears, which they threw down from the masts. The fighting was structured and carefully calculated but an absolute ruckus\u201d says Warming. \n \n Danish soldiers, allied with soldiers from L\u00fcbeck, managed to defeat the Swedish crew and capture the warship. When the ship exploded and sank, it had three to four hundred Dano-L\u00fcbeckian soldiers aboard. \n \n A 3D- model of the shipwreck. (Video: Ocean Discovery / Ingemar Lundgren) \n \n A Swedish change of tactics \n \n The new examination of the Mars shipwreck provides new insights into the events that took place between Denmark and Sweden during the Northern Seven Years\u2019 War between 1563 and 1570. \n \n They have documented a change in Swedish tactics from a focus on close quarter combat to long distance fighting, as indicated by large cannons up to 4.8 metres long. \n \n Despite the large cannons, the Swedish crew did not manage to avoid engaging in close quarter combat with their enemies. The soldiers aboard were positioned underneath a net that covered the deck and was designed to prevent the enemy from jumping on board \u2013 a so-called anti-boarding net. \n \n \u201cWe know about the use of anti-boarding nets in this battle from richly detailed written sources. The Swedish Admiral, Jacob Bagge, describes in his own account of the battle how he was injured in the shoulder by a javelin thrown from one of the fighting tops of the enemy ships. t. We are told he became furious and began shooting at those who had injured him with arquebuses so that they fell into the net below,\u201d says Warming. \n \n Read More: Medieval shipwreck hints at psychological warfare \n \n A snapshot of a moment in time \n \n Until 2011, historians relied on written sources for information about what happened to Mars, including letters from the Danish admiral Herluf Trolle and the Swedish admiral Jacob Bagge, and official royal documents. \n \n But the shipwreck provides an entirely different type of documentation. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s some \u2018fake news\u2019 in the written sources. Many people wanted to claim the honour of defeating the Mars for various political reasons. But when we study the wreckage itself we see a large congruency between the wreck site and the historical sources. One of the most striking observations was that it really was sunk by a large explosion. It was so violent that the front of the ship lies 40 metres away from the other remains,\u201d says Warming. \n \n For maritime archaeologist Mikkel Thomsen from the Viking Ship Museum, Denmark, looking at the well preserved, and complete remains captures a snapshot of a moment in time. \n \n \u201cYou really feel that you\u2019re in the killing fields,\u201d says Thomsen, who was not involved in the study. \n \n \u201cThe wreckage gives a snapshot of a piece of military and political history. It\u2019s also an international history as the Seven Years\u2019 War was fought across national boundaries,\u201d he says. \n \n Read More: Historic shipwrecks could be preserved in the Antarctic \n \n Divers filmed the shipwreck \n \n The Mars remains lay 70 metres beneath the surface of the Baltic Sea\u2014so deep that researchers could not go down themselves to investigate. Instead, professional divers and ROVs were deployed to film the wreck. \n \n The footage and recordings were used to create 3D-models of the wreck and the artefacts found on the site. \n \n Scientists and divers have not been granted permission to touch or remove anything from the wreck or nearby, which might be for the best, according to Thomsen. \n \n \u201cThe Baltic Sea has extremely good preservation conditions. The water is low in oxygen, cold, and fresh. So boring worms that are usually the greatest threat to wood cannot live there,\u201d says Thomsen. \n \n Lifting the remains out of the water would lead to breakdown and damage of the materials, he says. \n \n \u201cMoreover, it would be very difficult and extremely expensive to retrieve it from such deep water,\u201d says Thomsen. \n \n The exploration of Mars was carried out by researchers from the Marine Research Institute MARIS at S\u00f6dert\u00f6rn University in Sweden, and divers from the diving organization GUE, V\u00e4stervik Museum, Ocean Discovery, and MMT. \n \n Fifteen divers and ten researchers have participated in the latest exploration of the ship. \n \n --------------- \n \n Read the original article in Danish at Videnskab.dk \n \n",

The vessel had an anti-boarding net, but as many as 400 enemy soldiers were among the 800 to 1,000 on board when a gunpowder explosion at Mars' bow sent it to rest 250 feet below the sea's surface near \u00d6land. \"It was so violent that the front of the ship lies [130 feet] away from the other remains,\" says Warming, noting any soldiers not killed in the explosion would have drowned.

It was carrying hundreds of soldiers when it went down in deep water near the Swedish island of \u00d6land, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \"It would be very difficult and extremely expensive to retrieve it from such deep water,\u201d says maritime archaeologist Rolf Fabricius Warming. \u201cYou really feel that you\u2019re in the killing fields.\u201d The wreck was discovered in 2011, but it wasn't until now that scientists have been able to compare it to historical sources. \"One of the most striking observations was that it really was sunk by a large explosion,\" says archaeologist Mikkel Thomsen from the Viking Ship Museum in Denmark. \" It was so violent that the front of the ship lies 40 meters away from the other remains.\"",

(Photo: Mike Campbell/WWJ) \n \n DETROIT (CBS Detroit) Volunteers in Detroit and across the nation spent the night counting the homeless, and one of those men who lives in the cold is dealing with it in a, shall we say, unusual way. \n \n He calls himself \u201cHonest Abe\u201d and he panhandles not just for pocket change, but also for the donor\u2019s credit and debit cards. He accepts cards with a reader attached to his cell phone. \n \n His real name is Abe Hagenston and he\u2019s been homeless in Detroit for seven years or so. The 8 Mile overpass on I-75 is home. \n \n Looking at that bleak, gray freeway facade with the wind whipping through, one could imagine he\u2019s happy about the relatively mild winter metro Detroit has experienced so far this year. \n \n Not so fast. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not really that easy, what we\u2019re lacking is snow,\u201d Abe told WWJ\u2019s Mike Campbell. \u201cOf course, there\u2019s no snow removal. I used to look forward to that, doing some shoveling.\u201d \n \n Without the extra cash, he hasn\u2019t made enough money this winter to buy new eyeglasses, he said, and he could use a new prescription. \n \n But as a bonus, with the extra time Abe says he and a group of fellow homeless have organized themselves \u201clike a union\u201d to panhandle in shifts. He also used the extra time to figure out a way to make donations more efficient. Don\u2019t have any change in your pocket? No problem. \n \n \u201cI take VISA, MasterCard, American Express,\u201d Abe told Campbell. \u201cI\u2019m the only homeless guy in America who can take a credit card. It\u2019s all done safely and securely through square.com.\u201d \n \n Square readers attach to credit cards and basically turn a smartphone into a card reader. They cost about $10 and square providers charge vendors a fee per transaction. In the case of itunes, the charge is 2.75 percent per transaction. \n \n It\u2019s unknown how many homeless occupy Detroit \u2014 or how many people have trusted Abe with their credit card information \u2014 but last year\u2019s count of people who live on the streets of Detroit included a rough estimate of 2,700. \n \n This year\u2019s count isn\u2019t ready yet, but people like Stacy Brackins, a case manager with mental health agency Detroit Central City spent the night cruising around town with gloves, hats, sleeping bags to count homeless men and women and try to encourage them to seek shelter. \n \n Hundreds of volunteers were involved in the count. According to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, the number of homeless in Michigan had declined 6 percent in the most recent report. There were an estimated 578,424 people experiencing homelessness across the country in 2014. \n \n How many homeless were ready to accept offers of warmth and shelter in Detroit Wednesday night? Some were, others were not. \n \n \u201cSome, they just don\u2019t want to come inside \u2014 they want their freedom,\u201d Brackins told the Detroit Free Press. ||||| (CNN) Forget the old \"I don't have change\" excuse you give panhandlers. Abe Hagenston has an app for that. \n \n Well, more like a card reader. He takes credit cards through Square as he works the corner of Woodward Avenue and 8 Mile Road in Detroit. \n \n Oh, and he has a website too. \n \n \"Being homeless is my business now,\" Hagenston told CNN affiliate WDIV . \"My business is being homeless.\" \n \n On the web \n \n Through his website, people can make contributions to a collection of homeless people, hire them for odd jobs or even report fake panhandlers who drive from the suburbs. \n \n \"I'm trying to turn this situation into something that will not only help me but help others,\" he said. \n \n Hagenston's been on the streets for 10 years and goes by the name \"Honest Abe.\" \n \n \"I've rebuilt my life a few times but this time I'm not getting it,\" he said. \"People don't realize how tough it is to come from nothing when you don't have any family or any friends.\" ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

    "document": "(CNN) A federal criminal investigation into a deadly duck boat sinking on a Missouri lake was initiated after the US Coast Guard determined the 17 deaths resulted from \"misconduct, negligence or inattention to the duties\" by the captain of the duck boat, according to a court document filed Wednesday. \n \n The new investigation also is looking at another duck boat captain and officials at the company that operates the tourist ride, the court document says. \n \n There are several investigations into the July 19 incident, including the state of Missouri, which is also looking into criminal liability, and the National Transportation Safety Board, which is trying to determine what caused the sinking. \n \n Survivors of some of the people who died are, in four cases, suing Ripley Entertainment, which runs the duck boat tours called Ride the Ducks Branson. \n \n On Wednesday, the US government attached a motion to the civil cases, asking that a court rule that federal investigators be allowed first to talk to the pertinent witnesses and participants in the case. \n \n Read More ||||| The captains of two Ride the Ducks boats that battled rough waters before one sank last month are targets of a criminal investigation, according to federal court documents filed Wednesday. \n \n Kenneth Scott McKee, captain of the sunken Stretch Duck 07, and Barry King, captain of Stretch Duck 54, \u201care aware of their status as targets of the Government action,\u201d the document says. They are under investigation for allegedly operating the vessel in a manner that endangered lives. \n \n Seventeen of the 31 passengers on Duck 07 died when the boat sank in Table Rock Lake near Branson on July 19. Duck 54 was also on the water but made it to shore. \n \n The documents filed in U.S. District Court Wednesday also indicate that Ripley Entertainment, which owns the duck boats, is another \u201ctarget\u201d or \u201csubject\u201d of the investigation.

Our heart aches for the Captain and passengers of the Duck that capsized.\u201d \n \n One woman responded: \u201cSo thankful Barry was guided to safety! Definitely on angels wings! Prayers for all.\u201d \n \n The Star repeatedly has attempted to talk with both captains. Those attempts have been unsuccessful. \n \n SHARE COPY LINK Three members of a family describe the duck boat tragedy as seen from the Showboat Branson Belle on Thursday at Table Rock Lake near Branson. \n \n Cellphone video taken from the nearby Showboat Branson Belle, which was docked at the time of the storm, captured the two boats as they struggled in the lake. A viral video of the incident ended right before McKee\u2019s boat went under. He was among the 14 survivors. \n \n The first 911 call about Stretch Duck 07 came at 7:09 p.m., 14 minutes after the boat entered the water that night. \n \n The National Weather Service had issued a severe thunderstorm warning at 6:32 p.m., specifically naming Table Rock Lake. The warning said winds in excess of 60 mph were possible. In reality, winds on the lake reached 73 mph with waves of more than 3 feet. \n \n According to a recent report by the National Transportation Safety Board, the captain and driver were on board at 6:28 that evening when someone stepped onto the back of the boat and told the crew to take the water portion of the tour first. It isn\u2019t known who that person is. The driver, whose job is to steer the duck boat on land, died in the sinking. \n \n The U.S. Coast Guard referred the investigation to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Western District of Missouri on Aug. 13 to pursue possible federal criminal charges. That office, based in Kansas City, includes the Table Rock Lake area. \n \n According to the document filed Wednesday, the Coast Guard notified the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office that its preliminary probable cause determination was that the sinking of Stretch Duck 07 and the loss of lives \u201cresulted from the misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties of the captain of the vessel at the time of the sinking, which is a violation of federal criminal law.\u201d \n \n The certificate of inspection for Stretch Duck 07 set stringent guidelines for wind and water conditions. It states that the \u201cvessel shall not be operated waterborne when winds exceed 35 mph, and/or the wave height exceeds two feet.\u201d \n \n The Coast Guard also notified the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office of its preliminary probable cause determination \u201cthat the operation of Stretch Duck 54 on July 19, 2018, was undertaken by the captain of that vessel in a grossly negligent manner that interfered with the safe operation of the vessel and endangered the lives or bodies of persons on board the vessel.\u201d \n \n The federal investigation is being conducted in addition to a separate criminal probe by the Missouri attorney general. \n \n Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley\u2019s office confirmed to The Star on July 30 that it had opened a criminal investigation to explore the possibility of violations of the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act. \n \n The act forbids fraud and deception in the sale of goods and services. \n \n Several lawsuits have been filed in federal and state courts, three on behalf of passengers who died and one on behalf of a survivor. Another was filed earlier this month by a man who jumped in the lake to try to help pull passengers to safety. \n \n The latest suit was filed Aug. 20 in U.S. District Court by the daughter of William Asher, a St. Louis man who died in the tragedy. Jennifer Asher alleges that Ripley Entertainment \u201ctook the lives of seventeen people when it made the conscious decision to disregard the known dangers of its vehicles in volatile weather and instructed its employees to begin their excursion on the water.\u201d \n \n Wednesday\u2019s filing asked the court to put a hold on the discovery process for all lawsuits until the criminal investigation is complete. Prosecutors say the action is necessary to prevent civil lawsuits from interfering with a federal probe. \n \n Ripley spokeswoman Suzanne Smagala-Potts said last week that the company was cooperating fully with federal and state authorities. \n \n \u201cWe are providing all documentation and materials requested in the case,\u201d she said in an email to The Star. \u201cHowever, as a party to the ongoing NTSB investigation, we are refrained from commenting to the media on the matters being investigated.\u201d \n \n The court documents filed Wednesday, however, cite a federal law regarding negligence or misconduct when operating a vessel. \n \n According to that law: \u201cEvery captain, engineer, pilot, or other person employed on any steamboat or vessel, by whose misconduct, negligence, or inattention to his duties on such vessel the life of any person is destroyed ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The duck boat sinking that killed 17 on a Missouri lake is now the subject of a federal criminal investigation after the Coast Guard found probable cause for negligence. The US Attorney's Office for the Western District of Missouri is seeking to delay civil lawsuits over the July 19 incident until the end of its \"wide-ranging\" investigation to prevent revealing evidence too early, though two boat captains already know themselves to be targets. Per the Springfield News-Leader, the Coast Guard found probable cause for \"misconduct, negligence, or inattention to the duties of the captain\" by Kenneth McKee of Ride the Ducks Branson's sunken Stretch Duck 07, and also probable cause that Barry King acted in a \"grossly negligent manner\" while operating Stretch Duck 54, which made it to safety. The Branson area had been under a severe thunderstorm warning for 20 minutes before Stretch Duck 07 entered Table Rock Lake, where 73mph winds whipped up waves more than three feet high. Per the Wichita Eagle, the boat wasn't to be operated in winds exceeding 35mph or waves exceeding two feet. Civil cases also accuse Ride the Ducks Branson, owned by Ripley Entertainment, of putting passengers at risk through use of boat canopies, citing a National Transportation Safety Board recommendation to remove them following a 1999 tragedy. The NTSB is also investigating this case, along with the state, per CNN. \"We continue to fully cooperate,\" Ripley says in a statement, adding \"we are providing all documentation and materials requested in the case.\"",
