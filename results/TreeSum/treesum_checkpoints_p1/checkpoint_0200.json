Oh has become a focus of worldwide attention after he was shot and badly wounded by fellow North Korean soldiers as he scrambled across the border in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that separates North and South on 13 November. \n \n Video of Oh\u2019s escape released on Wednesday showed him stumbling over the border and being dragged unconscious through the undergrowth by South Korean troops. \n \n Lee has been one of very few people to speak with Oh since he arrived at the hospital, the surgeon said in an interview at his office at Ajou University Hospital, a few floors away from where the defector lies guarded by South Korean special forces and intelligence officers. \n \n The surgeon, who has hung a South Korean flag in the soldier\u2019s room, said he is avoiding subjects that may disturb his patient. Oh is eating his first \u201cclear liquid\u201d food such as broths, and can smile, talk, and use his hands, Lee said. But when his patient woke on Sunday he cried out in pain, and Lee said he is still anxious about the South Korean guards. \n \n Lee said Oh told him that he had joined the North Korean army when he was 17, after secondary school graduation. The soldier\u2019s hair was styled \u201clike a jarhead, like a US marine, so I actually joked \u2018why don\u2019t you join the South Korean marines?\u2019 He smiled and said that he would never ever go back to the military system again.\u201d \n \n Medical teams have worked for days to remove the shards of at least four bullets from Oh\u2019s body, stitch up his shredded organs, and treat pre-existing conditions including tuberculosis, hepatitis B, and a case of massive intestinal worms, Lee said. \n \n North Korean defector had 27cm parasitic worm in his stomach Read more \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s a quite strong man,\u201d said Lee. \n \n Since Oh\u2019s defection, North Korea appeared to have replaced all its security guards on the border, an intelligence source in the South told Yonhap news agency on Thursday. \n \n Lee said that when the defector arrived in an American military helicopter at the hospital \u2013 which is equipped with state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment and is used to treat VIP visitors such as visiting US presidents \u2013 he came with zero personal information. \n \n On the flight in, American army flight medics had fought to keep Oh alive, jabbing a large needle into his chest to treat a collapsed lung. \n \n Oh was immediately wheeled into a diagnostic room where doctors confirmed he was suffering from massive internal bleeding. \u201cWe knew then that we didn\u2019t have time to hesitate,\u201d Lee said. \n \n Two major surgeries were required to remove the bullets and patch Oh back together, and the medical team pumped as much as 12 litres of blood transfusions into his body. The normal body has less than half that much blood. \n \n \u201cHe told me that he is so thankful for South Koreans for saving his life and giving him that much blood,\u201d Lee said. \n \n Lee has been playing South Korean pop music and American films and TV shows for his patient, but has not exposed him to any news coverage. \n \n Among the shows, Oh showed a liking for the French-American thriller Transporter 3, comedy Bruce Almighty starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman, and the crime-solving TV series CSI, Lee said. \n \n Most North Korean defectors undergo security questioning by South Korea\u2019s intelligence agency once they arrive before being sent to a resettlement centre for a three-month education on life in the South. After they are released, central and local governments provide 7m won ($6,450) in cash over a year, as well as support in housing, education and job training. \n \n Police officers are assigned to each of the defectors to ensure their security and safety. \n \n Even if Oh fully recovers, some scars will stay for the rest of his life, the surgeon said. \n \n Among the longest lasting wounds will be the damage to his colon, which was shredded by a bullet and had to be stitched back together in seven places. \u201cIt\u2019s a lifelong complication for the patient, so he\u2019s better to be very cautious in his diet,\u201d said the surgeon. \n \n Besides the potential for further medical complications, Lee says he is most worried about making sure Oh recovers psychologically. The soldier has already told him he had a nightmare about being returned to the North. \n \n The surgeon said he has asked senior South Korean military officials who are eager to question the soldier to hold off while he recovers. \n \n \u201cThis North Korean guy is not going anywhere,\u201d Lee said. \u201cHe is staying in South Korea. So we don\u2019t need to be hasty. ||||| CLOSE The US-led UN command released dramatic video showing a North Korean soldier dash across border into South Korea as North Korean troops fire at him.

(Photo: AFP) \n \n A North Korean soldier who was shot and wounded as he sought to scramble across a heavily guarded border to freedom in South Korea is a \"nice guy\" who appreciates American movies, TV shows and western-style pop music, according to the doctor treating him. \n \n Surgeon John Cook-Jong Lee told the Reuters news agency this week that the North Korean defector, a young soldier who is recovering in a Seoul hospital and has only been identified by the name \"Oh,\" admitted to liking the comedy film Bruce Almighty starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman and the gritty crime television series CSI. \n \n The 24-year-old also expressed admiration for K-pop, a South Korean musical genre that mixes elements of electronica, rock, hip hop, R&B and jazz. \n \n More: Video shows North Korean soldier's daring, bullet-ridden defection to South \n \n It wasn't clear if the soldier was first exposed to western movies, TV shows and music in the hospital ward where he arrived after being shot four times on Nov. 13, or if he gained access to them while inside North Korea. Pyongyang is a highly secretive regime that restricts information its citizens can access to crack down on dissent. \n \n Dramatic footage of the soldier's daring defection was released Wednesday by the American-led United Nations Command that helps police the 1950-1953 Korean War armistice. It showed showed him racing across the border under fire from former comrades, and then being hauled to safety by South Korean troops. \n \n \"He told me that he is so thankful for South Koreans for saving his life and giving him so much blood,\" Lee said of the soldier in the interview. He said \"Oh\" was recovering well physically but having recurring nightmares about being sent back to the North. \n \n \"He's a pretty nice guy,\" he said, adding that he had hair \"like a jarhead, like a U.S. Marine, so I actually joked \u2018why don\u2019t you join the South Korean marines?\u2019 He smiled and said that he would never ever go back to the military system again.\" \n \n North Korea is believed to have replaced all the border security guards who failed to prevent the soldier's defection, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported Friday. \n \n Marc Knapper, the acting U.S. Ambassador to South Korea, tweeted a picture Thursday of what he said showed North Koreans planting two trees and digging a trench at the spot where \"Oh\" crossed into the demilitarized zone that separates the two Koreas. North Korean border guards who were chasing him had strayed into the area before turning back, technically violating the terms of the Korean War truce. \n \n More: Kim Jong Un's family: The bizarre, cruel world of North Korea's dynasty \n \n Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2iL6enG ||||| SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has reportedly replaced guards and fortified a section of its border with South Korea where a North Korean soldier defected last week, while South Korean and U.S. soldiers have been decorated for their role in the defector\u2019s rescue. \n \n North Korean soldiers dig a trench and plant trees in the area where, on November 13, a defector ran across the border at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) dividing North Korea and South Korea November 22, 2017. Handout via REUTERS \n \n The North Korean defector was shot and wounded by his fellow soldiers as he dashed into the South Korean side of the Joint Security Area (JSA) last week. \n \n The South Korean and U.S. soldiers who led a rescue attempt to drag the gravely injured soldier to safety have been awarded medals, according to U.S. Forces Korea. \n \n A group of senior diplomats based in Seoul visited the JSA on Wednesday morning where they saw five North Korean workers digging a deep trench in the area where the soldier had dashed across the line after getting his jeep stuck in a small ditch, a member of the diplomatic delegation told Reuters on Friday. \n \n In a photograph of the visit posted to the Twitter account of acting U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Marc Knapper, North Korean workers could be seen using shovels to dig a deep trench on the North Korean side of the line as soldiers stood guard. \n \n \u201cThe workers were being watched very closely by the KPA guards, not just the two in the photo, but others out of shot behind the building,\u201d said the diplomat, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation. \n \n According to an intelligence official cited by South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency, the North has replaced the 35-40 soldiers it had guarding the JSA at the time of the incident. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re closely monitoring the North Korean military\u2019s movement in the JSA,\u201d a South Korean defense ministry official told reporters, without confirming the reduction in border guards. \u201cThere are limits as to what we can say about things we know.\u201d \n \n Reuters was unable to independently verify the reports, although photos taken by Knapper and other diplomats of soldiers guarding the area where workers were digging the trench showed them dressed in slightly different uniforms to the ones usually worn by North Korea\u2019s JSA guards. \n \n Two new trees had also been planted in the small space between the ditch and the line with the South, the diplomat told Reuters, in an apparent effort to make it more difficult for would-be defectors to drive across the ground. \n \n Meanwhile, in South Korea, U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) said it had awarded its own JSA soldiers - three South Korean and three U.S. soldiers - the Army Commendation medal in recognition for their efforts in rescuing the defector. \n \n The medals were personally handed out by USFK Commander Vincent Brooks in a ceremony on Thursday, according to USFK\u2019s Facebook page. \n \n The soldiers had been responsible for dragging the wounded North Korean soldier to safety in a daring rescue seen in security camera footage released by the United Nations Command earlier this week. \n \n Pyongyang has not commented on the defection of its soldier, who is now in stable condition despite sustaining multiple injuries sustained from gunshot wounds to his arm and torso. \n \n The young soldier, known only by his family name Oh, is a quiet, pleasant man who has nightmares about being returned to the North, his surgeon told Reuters on Thursday. \n \n (For a graphic, click reut.rs/2jfoZPI) ||||| No medical drama is complete without a bold-yet-sensitive heartthrob doctor in a leading role. The incredible tale of a North Korean soldier's escape across the demilitarized zone last week is no exception. \n \n The McDreamy in this case is Lee Cook-jong, the trauma surgeon who has operated on the soldier several times and provided updates along the way \u2014 including a video showing Lee picking 10-inch-long parasitic worms out of the man's intestines and his declaration Wednesday that the defector will survive. \n \n \"The patient is not going to die,\" Lee told reporters at Ajou University Hospital south of Seoul, announcing that the man had regained consciousness and was stable. \n \n Although he remains in the intensive care unit, he could be transferred to a general ward as soon as this weekend. \n \n The 24-year-old North Korean soldier, who has been identified only by his surname, Oh, was shot five times as he made his brazen escape Nov. 13. \n \n Closed-circuit television footage released by the U.S. military on Wednesday showed Oh driving a jeep southward before the vehicle became stuck in a ditch yards from the Military Demarcation Line that forms the border. \n \n Oh jumped out and started running for the line. Four North Korean border guards tried to stop him, firing more than 40 rounds at him. One guard briefly crossed the line, violating the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953. \n \n The video showed Oh lying wounded in a pile of leaves against a building on the southern side. Then three South Korean soldiers crawled out and dragged him to safety. \n \n From there, he was put in a U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopter and flown 50 miles south to the hospital in Suwon, where Lee was waiting. \n \n \"If it weren't for their emergency measures, he would have died before arriving at the hospital,\" Lee said. \n \n [Dramatic video shows North Korean soldier making a run for freedom ] \n \n It was still touch-and-go when Oh arrived at the hospital. His blood pressure was so low after losing so much blood that the doctors did not even have time to check his blood type. Instead, they pumped about 40 units \u2014 between three and four times the amount of blood contained in a human body \u2014 of type O into him. \n \n He has had three surgeries, including an attempt to repair his damaged internal organs and stop the contamination caused by the parasites and the injuries. \n \n Through it all, the trauma surgeon, often in scrubs, has been giving regular updates on the soldier's condition. \n \n The revelation that the man had a severe parasitic infection \u2014 Lee said he had never seen such a case except in medical textbooks \u2014 and that his stomach contained raw corn kernels prompted widespread shock in South Korea. North Korean front-line soldiers were supposed to be elite troops, yet this man had worms not seen in South Korea since the 1970s and had been eating uncooked corn? \n \n Oh also has tuberculosis and hepatitis B, Lee said. And, at 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighing about 130 pounds, he is several inches shorter and 20 pounds lighter than the average male 18-year-old South Korean. \n \n There is intense interest in the soldier, and military intelligence officers reportedly are eager to question him about his escape, but Lee has been fending them off. The soldier is showing signs of depression and post-traumatic stress, and it will take about a month before he is well enough to answer questions, the doctor said. \n \n For now, Lee is keeping the conversation light \u2014 talking about the way things are done in South Korea rather than asking him about North Korea \u2014 and trying to cheer him up. \n \n The medical staff played him \"Gee,\" a peppy pop song by Girls' Generation \u2014 featuring lyrics such as, \"Oh, it's too pretty, your soul's too pretty/It's love at first sight\" \u2014 and he declared that he liked girl bands. \n \n Lee also said Oh has been watching the American TV series \"CSI\" and the action movie \"The Transporter,\" in which a former special-forces operative hires himself out as a mercenary. \n \n The staff also has hung a South Korean flag in his room to reassure him he really is in the South. \n \n [Escaped North Korean soldier fights for life after being shot crossing DMZ ] \n \n This is not Lee's first time in the spotlight. The surgeon became a national hero in 2011 when he saved the life of a ship captain who had been shot by Somali pirates. \n \n After pirates seized a chemical freighter near the Gulf of Aden in 2011, South Korean commandos stormed the ship and the pirates shot the captain six times during the rescue attempt. \n \n Lee was waiting at a hospital in Oman and saved the captain's life, earning a reputation as the country's leading trauma surgeon. There was even a popular medical drama based on this story, \"Golden Time.\" The title was a reference to Lee's frequent reminder that it is the hour after a severe injury that is most important for saving someone's life. \n \n The 48-year-old Lee, who is blind in one eye and renowned for working 36-hour shifts, was also the inspiration for a character in another drama, \"Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim,\" released last year. He became such a celebrity that even octogenarians with diabetes were trying to get in to see him. \n \n Lee became a doctor in South Korea but trained as a critical-care surgeon at the University of California at San Diego Medical Center in 2003. He then went on to the Royal London Hospital's trauma center. \n \n Returning home, he realized that there was no equivalent facility at any hospital in South Korea and estimated that about 30,000 trauma patients were dying in the country each year because of treatment delays and a lack of dedicated trauma units. \n \n He persuaded authorities to fund proper trauma centers, including his unit at Ajou University Hospital. Now, 20 percent of revenue from traffic fines goes to trauma centers in the country. \n \n [American detained trying to enter North Korea; North Korean soldier escapes to the South ] \n \n But for a trauma surgeon, Lee faces a predicament that is unimaginable for American ER doctors: He seldom gets to treat gunshot wounds, because South Korea has very strict rules on gun ownership. \n \n Ten murders with a firearm were reported in South Korea between 2010 and 2015, compared with 8,592 in the United States, according to figures from the Small Arms Survey. \n \n Instead, the relatively few gunshot wounds he has treated have been sustained by South Korean and U.S. soldiers hurt during military drills, he told the Korea Times in 2015. Still, that appears to have been enough practice to save the North Korean soldier's life. \n \n Now, South Koreans are waiting for Lee's next statement on the soldier's prognosis. \n \n In online forums, South Korean \"netizens\" have been sending their best wishes to Lee and his patient. \n \n \"A Korean who put his life on the line to cross over to the south. Hopefully he can be saved!\" wrote one in an online medical forum. \n \n Another added, \"Please survive so you can live in South Korea!\" \n \n Read more: \n \n What the parasites in a defector\u2019s stomach tell us about North Korea \n \n Graphic: This thin ribbon of land separates North and South Korea \n \n Today\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world \n \n Like Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 North Korea is trying to make sure that no others will be able to defect the way that a young soldier did last week. The fixes aren't exactly high-tech: North Korean soldiers were seen digging a big trench in the border area where the soldier first drove and then ran to freedom, reports Reuters. They also planted trees, apparently to prevent vehicles from getting through in the future. Finally, North Korea also seems to have replaced all of its border security guards, reports the Yonhap news agency, which surmises that any officers involved are in for serious punishment. Details and developments: The soldier: \"He's a pretty nice guy,\" the lead South Korean surgeon says of the 24-year-old defector, identified only by the name \"Oh.\" The patient likes Bruce Almighty and CSI, though USA Today notes it's unclear whether he saw that US movie and show in the hospital or previously in North Korea on the black market. Oh faces a long recuperation, having been shot at least five times. One bullet decimated his colon. The surgeon: The incident has put the spotlight, again, on 48-year-old trauma surgeon Lee Cook-jong. Lee is the one giving regular updates after the surgeries he performs, and the Washington Post reports that he previously became a \"national hero\" in 2011 when he saved the life of a ship captain shot by Somali pirates. That feat became the subject of a medical drama. Lee, blind in one eye, also served as the inspiration for a character in a second drama called Romantic Doctor, Teacher Kim, which was released last year and gave him certifiable celeb status. The Post uses the terms \"heartthrob\" and \"McDreamy\" in the profile. Next for Oh: The surgeon, taking note of Oh's \"jarhead\" haircut, jokingly suggested that Oh eventually join the South Korean military: \"He smiled and said that he would never ever go back to the military system again.\" When he's stronger, Oh will be debriefed. Then he'll get help with housing, education, and job training from the South Korean government, reports the Guardian.",

    "document": "New mothers in the U.S. are increasingly older and better educated than they were two decades ago, according to a study on the state of American motherhood released Thursday by the Pew Research Center. \n \n But that doesn't mean women are waiting for the right moment: The study also found that half of mothers surveyed said parenthood \"just happened.\" \n \n While most women giving birth are doing it within the context of marriage, researchers said a record 41 percent of births were to unmarried women in 2008. That's up from 28 percent in 1990, according to the study, \"The New Demography of American Motherhood.\" The trend crossed major racial and ethnic groups. \n \n Nearly 14 percent of mothers of newborns were 35 or older two years ago _ and only about 10 percent were in their teens. The age trend was reversed in 1990, when teens had a 13 percent share of births. \n \n \"I think everyone will welcome a decline in births to teens,\" said D'Vera Cohn, a senior writer on the study. \"It's notable that the population of teens is larger than it used to be, so there were more who could have become teen mothers.\" \n \n Today, one in seven babies is born to a mother at least 35 years old. In 1990, one in 11 had a mother in that age group. \n \n Most mothers of newborns (54 percent) had at least some college education in 2008, an increase from 41 percent in 1990. Among mothers 35 or older, 71 percent had at least some college education. \n \n Improvements in medical care and fertility treatment, along with marriage and childbearing postponed to seek additional education, all factor into the shifts. \n \n \"The rise in women's education levels has changed the profile of the typical mother of a newborn baby,\" the report said. Cohn added that a lower share of mothers ended their education after high school, \"so some of those mothers who would have been high school graduates in 1990 have some college education today.\" \n \n The report is based on data from the National Center for Health Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau, along with a telephone survey in April 2009 of about 1,000 parents, likely parents and other adults of both genders. \n \n Overall, there were 4.3 million births in the U.S. in 2008, compared with 4.2 million in 1990. The number had risen each year from 2003 to 2007, then dipped in an apparent link to the economic downturn, the researchers said. \n \n When American parents are asked why they decided to have a child, most cite \"The joy of having children,\" the study said. For nearly half of parents, though, an important explanation is: \"It wasn't a decision; it just happened.\" \n \n Women surveyed were more likely than men to cite \"it just happened\" as somewhat or very important in their decision to give birth the first time. \n \n Stephanie Coontz, director of research and public education for the nonprofit Council on Contemporary Families and a writer who teaches history and family studies at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., said the rise of single motherhood is significant. \n \n \"It's yet another nail in the coffin in the hope that we can solve the challenges facing us today by shoehorning everyone back into marriages,\" she said. \"One of the big problems with that at this point is very often kids do worse if their mother rushes into a marriage that may be unstable.\" \n \n Multiple births associated with the trend toward older motherhood were up sharply, including a 70 percent increase in the twin birth rate from 1980 to 2004. \n \n \"Not only are women in their 30s more likely than younger women to conceive multiples on their own, they also are more likely to undergo fertility treatments, which are linked to births of multiples,\" the researchers said. ||||| More children are born to women older than 35 than to teenagers, a change born of medical science, later marriages and evolving attitudes about motherhood, according to a new study released Thursday. \n \n The Pew Research Center, citing census and government health statistics, said the trend toward mothers who are older and better educated cuts across all ethnicities in the United States. \n \n Between 1990 and 2008, the number of births to mothers older than 35 leapt from 368,000 to 603,000. One in seven babies -- or 14 percent of a total of about 4 million births -- were born to older mothers in 2008. Almost one in four were first-time mothers. The vast majority, 71 percent, had at least some college education before giving birth. \n \n By contrast, births to women younger than 20 declined from 533,000 in 1990 to 441,000 in 2008, or one in 10 babies. The teenage birthrate has declined steadily since 1990, except for a spike in 2006 and 2007. \n \n The statistics reflect far-reaching changes for women in society, affecting their decisions on when to marry and start families. The average age for marriage has been rising, as has the share of women who have attended college. Women with more education often delay marriage and childbearing while they complete their schooling and establish careers. \n \n The average age at which women have their first child is 25, a year older than in 1990. \n \n \"It's clear that young adult transitions are being postponed,\" said Suzanne Bianchi, a sociologist at UCLA. \"Children born to highly educated mothers increasingly are born later in life. The mothers are usually married, and they have a much higher chance of raising children in a stable marriage that lasts through a child's childhood.\" \n \n The delay in getting married also helps explain two seemingly contradictory trends. The number of unwed mothers has risen sharply in the United States, so that about four out of every 10 births are to unmarried women, which includes most births to women in their early 20s. At the same time, there has been an increase in the number of women who have never had children. \n \n Experts say some of that may be by choice, and some of it is timing. \n \n \"We're trained to think science can solve all fertility problems,\" said Wendy Manning, a sociologist at Bowling Green State University, who teaches a class in fertility and family planning. \"In fact, there are quite a few limitations.\" \n \n The Pew report included a survey on American attitudes toward parenthood that suggests there is less stigma attached to older mothers than once was common. About one in three disapproved of women having babies after age 40, undergoing fertility treatment or remaining childless; the rest said those were good things or made no difference to society. \n \n Maria Bachman, 42, who runs the Web site MothersOver35.com from her home outside Tucson, said actresses like Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman, who are older mothers, have helped create a positive image of women who have children at the onset of middle age. \n \n \"When they're put on the cover of magazines, they're showing it's not too late to be an older mom,\" said Bachman, who was 37 when she had her first child and 40 when she had her second. \"In fact, older moms are considered sexy.\" \n \n When asked why they decided to have their first child, 87 percent of the parents in the Pew survey answered, \"The joy of having children.\" But nearly half said, \"There wasn't a reason. It just happened.\"",

Of 2008's 4 million births, one in seven were to older mothers, while one in 10 were to teens.

What space has been devoted to the race in Israel, has emphasized the lackluster nature of the campaign and its foregone conclusion \u2013 not exactly stop-the-presses kinds of stories. \n \n In perhaps the clearest sign that the elections have been viewed as less-than-gripping news cycle fodder, a recurrent theme in the relatively few stories that have been published here is what\u2019s not being discussed in the campaign, rather than what is. \n \n Both The New York Times and Washington Post on Monday ran stories, well inside the paper, about the lack of debate on certain topics. \n \n In a Memo from the Middle East titled \u201cAn Unusual Election for Its Non-issues,\u201d The Times detailed the lack of details being provided on policies, noting that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu hadn\u2019t even produced a formal platform. \n \n \n \n The Washington Post summed up its story with the headline: \u201cIn Israeli election, Iran issue avoided.\u201d \n \n And if Israeli politicians aren\u2019t tackling big issues with global implications, why would the media an ocean away pay them much heed? Iran, Syria, Al-Qaida remain major concerns in America. \n \n But in contrast to all these actors, who are driving new developments each day, Israel has remained static on these issues during the course of the election, and there is no sense that the elections have provided clues to what course the next government could take on these subjects. \n \n With Obama re-taking his place in the Oval Office and Netanyahu all-but-certain to remain prime minister, even the popular storyline of dysfunction and disagreement between the two leaders only makes for well-trod ground. \n \n Though the discord could well continue \u2013 and certainly the tensions over the announcement of construction plans in E-1, put forward by Netanyahu, at least in part to neutralize a political challenge on his right, point in that direction \u2013 it is also the case that after four years of sparring, the two wearied men could instead opt for accommodation. \n \n Then the media would have even fewer stories to write on the US-Israel relationship. ||||| TEL AVIV \u2014 A weakened Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu emerged Wednesday from Israel \u2019s national election likely to serve a third term, after voters on Tuesday gave a surprising second place to a new centrist party founded by a television celebrity who emphasized kitchen-table issues like class size and apartment prices. \n \n For Mr. Netanyahu, who entered the race an overwhelming favorite with no obvious challenger, the outcome was a humbling rebuke as his ticket lost seats in the new Parliament. Over all, his conservative team came in first, but it was the center, led by the political novice Yair Lapid, 49, that emerged newly invigorated, suggesting that at the very least Israel\u2019s rightward tilt may be stalled. \n \n Mr. Lapid, a telegenic celebrity whose father made a splash with his own short-lived centrist party a decade ago, ran a campaign that resonated with the middle class. His signature issue is a call to integrate the ultra-Orthodox into the army and the work force. \n \n Perhaps as important, he also avoided antagonizing the right, having not emphasized traditional issues of the left, like the peace process. Like a large majority of the Israeli public, he supports a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but is skeptical of the Palestinian leadership\u2019s willingness to negotiate seriously; he has called for a return to peace talks but has not made it a priority. \n \n Sensing his message of strength was not penetrating, Mr. Netanyahu posted a panicky message on Facebook before the polls closed, saying, \u201cThe Likud government is in danger, go vote for us for the sake of the country\u2019s future.\u201d Tuesday ended with Mr. Netanyahu reaching out again \u2014 this time to Mr. Lapid, Israel\u2019s newest kingmaker, offering to work with him as part of the \u201cbroadest coalition possible.\u201d \n \n Israel\u2019s political hierarchy is only partly determined during an election. The next stage, when factions try to build a majority coalition, decides who will govern, how they will govern and for how long. While Mr. Lapid has signaled a willingness to work with Mr. Netanyahu, the ultimate coalition may bring together parties with such different ideologies and agendas that the result is paralysis. \n \n Still, for the center, it was a time of celebration. \n \n \u201cThe citizens of Israel today said no to politics of fear and hatred,\u201d Mr. Lapid told an upscale crowd of supporters who had welcomed him with drums, dancing and popping Champagne corks. \u201cThey said no to the possibility that we might splinter off into sectors, and groups and tribes and narrow interest groups. They said no to extremists, and they said no to antidemocratic behavior.\u201d \n \n With 99 percent of the ballots counted by Wednesday morning, the traditional blocs were evenly divided, with 60 Parliament seats for right-wing and religious parties, and 60 for center, left and Arab-dominated factions. \n \n Mr. Netanyahu\u2019s Likud-Beiteinu ticket had 31 seats, followed by 19 for Mr. Lapid\u2019s Yesh Atid and 15 for Labor. The ultra-Orthodox Shas party and the Jewish Home, which is dominated by religious-Zionists and advocates annexing the West Bank, each garnered 11 seats. Tzipi Livni\u2019s Hatnua and the left-wing, pro-peace Meretz each got six, while the three Arab parties totaled 12. Kadima which won the most parliament seats \u2013 28 \u2013 in the last election, had 2, having collapsed after briefly joining the Netanyahu coalition last year but failing to fulfill its promises. Votes of soldiers and a few other groups had yet to be counted and could change the balance. \n \n The prime minister called Mr. Lapid shortly after the polls closed at 10 p.m. Tuesday and, according to Israeli television reports, told him that they had great things to do together for the country. In his speech to a rowdy crowd of supporters here Wednesday morning, he said, \u201cI see many partners.\u201d \n \n Mr. Lapid indicated he was open to working with Mr. Netanyahu, saying the only way to face Israel\u2019s challenges was \u201ctogether.\u201d But he added: \u201cWhat is good for Israel is not in the possession of the right, and nor is it in the possession of the left. It lies in the possibility of creating here a real and decent center.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It's election day in Israel, but there's not a lot of intrigue: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is almost certain to win another term, although his ticket (a joint ticket combining his conservative Likud Party with the ultranationalist Yisrael Beiteinu) could lose as many as 10 of the seats it currently holds in Parliament, perhaps to Jewish Home, a party that is further to the right. Despite the foregone conclusion, YNetNews reports that the country is seeing its highest voter turnout since 1999, and the election could end up breaking voting records in Israel.

This year, the Central Elections Committee ran a rousing voter drive, and President Shimon Peres urged everyone to vote. The Jerusalem Post notes that US media don't seem to care about the Israeli vote, perhaps because it falls on the day after President Obama's second inauguration.

She was found not guilty on two mail fraud and two wire fraud charges. \n \n Prosecutors argued Brown inflated her charitable giving to receive larger tax refunds and also failed to disclose tens of thousands of dollars in income she received from One Door and other sources. \n \n Assistant U.S. Attorneys Tysen Duva and Eric Olshan painted Brown as an egotistical politician who lived beyond her means. Using bank records, checks, letters, emails and hundreds of other documents, prosecutors made the case Brown directed the deposit of $37,000 of One Door cash into her account. They also claimed she was instrumental in planning nine events that cost the sham charity $330,000. \n \n Brown\u2019s attorney James Smith crafted a defense that hinged upon the jury believing Brown Chief of Staff Ronnie Simmons was the real mastermind behind the around four-year fraud. \n \n Smith told the court Brown was an aging public servant who relied heavily on Simmons and other staff to help keep her personal life in order. \n \n Brown, who maintains her innocence, refused to answer questions while leaving court. \n \n Her lawyer James Smith read this statement: \u201cWhile she\u2019s certainly disappointed by today\u2019s verdict, she respects the American justice system and the jury.\" \n \n Smith said he plans to ask for a new trial. \n \n \u201cThere are a number of motions that we intend to file that we believe will stop this case from going forward to sentencing,\u201d he said. \n \n Judge Timothy Corrigan has at least three months to sentence Brown if he rejects Smith\u2019s motions. Corrigan has wide discretion in her punishment because there are no mandatory minimum sentences for Brown\u2019s charges, Smith said. \n \n Corrigan will also decide the fate of two Brown associates \u2014 former chief of staff Ronnie Simmons and One Door for Education President Carla Wiley \u2014 who both testified against her.

In roughly five years, prosecutors say, the charity distributed just two scholarships. \n \n Prosecutors alleged \u2014 and on Thursday, the jury agreed \u2014 that Brown and Simmons pocketed the rest of the funds, using them for lavish events such as a golf tournament and luxury boxes for an NFL game and a Beyonce concert. \n \n WJCT has more from the courtroom: \n \n \"Assistant U.S. Attorneys Tysen Duva and Eric Olshan painted Brown as an egotistical politician who lived beyond her means. Using bank records, checks, letters, emails and hundreds of other documents, prosecutors made the case Brown directed the deposit of $37,000 of One Door cash into her account. They also claimed she was instrumental in planning nine events that cost the sham charity $330,000.\" \n \n Brown had argued that the fraud was entirely the doing of Simmons, who earlier pleaded guilty and testified against her. Brown didn't speak after the verdict was rendered, but her attorney James Smith told reporters, \"I still have a lot of work to do on this case,\" referring to the sentencing phase and the motion he plans to file for a new trial. \n \n WJCT's Ryan Michael Benk reports the sentencing phase could take 90 days or longer for Brown, who left office earlier this year after losing her re-election bid in the district she had represented for nearly a quarter-century. ||||| Tough words for Corrine Brown from the Justice Department, found guilty today on numerous charges: \n \n \n \n \u201cFormer Congresswoman Corrine Brown violated the public trust, the honor of her position, and the integrity of the American system of government when she abused one of the most powerful positions in the nation for her own personal gain.

McKissick, Sr., left,) escorts Former Congresswoman Corrine Brown outside the Bryan Simpson United States Courthouse on Thursday, May 11, 2017 in Jacksonville, Fla. Brown was found... (Associated Press) \n \n JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 After a historic, nearly 25-year career representing Florida in Congress, former U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown was found guilty on Thursday of taking money from a charity that was purported to be giving scholarships to poor students. \n \n The verdict came after prosecutors outlined a pattern of fraud by Brown, 70, and her top aide that included using hundreds of thousands of dollars from the One Door for Education Foundation for lavish parties, trips and shopping excursions. She was convicted of 18 of the 22 charges against her, including lying on her taxes and on her congressional financial disclosure forms. \n \n Wearing a lavender suit, Brown watched the judge read each verdict in a silent courtroom with no visible reaction. She later left the courthouse holding onto the arm of a companion, surrounded by dozens of reporters. A few supporters shouted \"We love you Corrine!\" and \"Keep the Faith!\" as she silently made her way to a waiting car. \n \n Brown, a Democrat who was one of the first three African Americans to be elected to Congress from Florida since Reconstruction, represented the district that included Jacksonville since 1993. \n \n Since her indictment last summer, she had been publicly defiant of the government's charges, saying in a statement she was among black elected officials who have been \"persecuted.\" She had pleaded not guilty to all of the charges, including the fraud, but lost re-election last fall after her indictment. \n \n \"Former Congresswoman Corrine Brown violated the public trust, the honor of her position, and the integrity of the American system of government when she abused one of the most powerful positions in the nation for her own personal gain,\" Acting Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Blanco, said in a statement after the verdict. \n \n Key to the government's conviction was the testimony of Brown's former chief of staff, Elias \"Ronnie\" Simmons, and the charity's president, Carla Wiley. Both pleaded guilty after their federal indictments for misusing the charity's funds, and testified against Brown. \n \n Federal prosecutors said Brown and her associates used One Door to bring in more than $800,000 between 2012 and 2016, including a high-profile golf tournament at TPC Sawgrass. Brown's indictment said the Virginia-based One Door only gave out one scholarship for $1,200 to an unidentified person in Florida. \n \n Simmons said Brown ordered him to take cash and checks from One Door's account. On dozens of occasions, Simmons said he was told to take out of One Door's account the maximum $800 from an ATM near his house and deposit hundreds of it in Brown's personal account. Sometimes he kept some for himself. \n \n Brown testified in her own defense, saying she was left in the dark about the goings-on with One Door's money, and blamed the theft on Simmons. \n \n Brown said she left those details to Simmons and other hired staffers, and said she should have paid more attention to her personal and professional finances. \n \n Her attorney, James Smith, said he plans to file a motion for a new trial and said Brown respects the American judicial system and the jury's verdict, even though she disagrees with it. \n \n \"She's strong and fighting for her innocence,\" Smith said outside the courthouse. \"And she will continue to do that.\" \n \n The judge did not set a date for Brown's sentencing, which could include many years of jail time. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Jason Dearen on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/JHDearen",

She died at Lady of the Sea General Hospital in Cut Off one day after lightning struck her campsite at the T-Bois Blues Festival in Larose. \n \n Longtime WWOZ Radio program director Dwayne Breashears knew Stavis through a tight-knit group of New Orleanians who travel each year to the Burning Man festival in Nevada. \n \n \u201cWe are all just numbed by it,\u201d Breashears said of Stavis\u2019 death, adding that it seemed she\u2019d been in New Orleans all of her life, though she grew up in New England, New York and Wisconsin. \u201cShe just dove into the culture of New Orleans, just became a part of it. She just wanted to do positive things here.\u201d \n \n Bethany Bultman, of the New Orleans Musicians\u2019 Clinic, described Stavis as \u201ca force for good\u201d who had put down roots in a city she had long admired. \n \n More On This Topic Woman killed, 2 injured after lightning strikes campsite Friday night at Larose music festival \n \n Bultman, a friend of Stavis\u2019 grandmother in Provincetown, Massachusetts, said that even as a teenager, Stavis would immediately listen to any New Orleans CD or read any New Orleans book that Bultman suggested. \n \n \u201cShe loved the culture of New Orleans; she couldn\u2019t get enough,\u201d said Bultman, who wasn\u2019t surprised when Stavis moved here with her boyfriend, musician Jake Gold, after the couple graduated together in 2009 from Wesleyan University in Connecticut. \n \n A few years later, when Bultman reigned as queen of the Krewe du Vieux parade in 2013, she wasn\u2019t surprised that Stavis was one of the first people she saw in the crowd. \u201cJacqui embraced everything and she participated and she was everywhere,\u201d Bultman said. \n \n Friday\u2019s lightning strike injured two other women, ages 24 and 30, who had sought shelter from a severe storm in the same small tent with Stavis. One woman was transported to University Medical Center in New Orleans, while the other remained in a hospital not far from the festival, according to a statement by Lafourche Parish Sheriff Craig Webre. \n \n Others who spent the night in tents on festival grounds were shaken by how hard the storm hit and described winds, rain, thunder and lightning so ferocious that people on opposite ends of the same small tent couldn\u2019t hear each other even if they shouted. \n \n After receiving a call about the injuries shortly after 10 p.m. Friday, Lafourche Parish Sheriff\u2019s Office deputies, volunteer firefighters and paramedics went to the scene and found Stavis unresponsive and the other two woman suffering from electric shock. All three were taken to a hospital. \n \n A large Labrador dog also died during the incident, Webre reported. \n \n No cause of death was available for Stavis. \n \n However, National Weather Service alerts note that 10 percent of lightning strikes can result in death, often from cardiac arrest or irreversible brain damage. Though the chance of being hit by lightning in a given year is less than 1 in 1 million, it does happen regularly. Over the past 30 years, the United States has averaged 49 reported lightning fatalities each year. \n \n The low-key, three-day T-Bois event calls itself a blues festival, though it also features other types of music. It offers home-cooked Cajun food, catfish, crawfish, beer and camping for all ticket-holders and is held on an alligator and crawfish farm owned for more than a century by the family of festival producer \u201cAlligator Mike\u201d Falgout, who modeled the festival after large crawfish boils hosted by his family. \n \n Falgout did not return messages left about the incident. \n \n New Orleanians who have attended T-Bois describe it as a relaxed event run largely by local volunteers. Two small stages mostly feature acts who play some variation on the blues; it is closed out each year by New Orleans guitarist Anders Osborne. \n \n Children and families often mill through the grounds, and many people camp there overnight. The capacity is limited to 1,200, and motorized vehicles are prohibited. \n \n An area of the site, the Burning Village, is reserved as an arts village modeled after Burning Man. Each year, participants like Stavis create special, often large-scale art, including a giant sculpture that is burned during the last night of the festival in a controlled fire watched by local firefighters. This year\u2019s sculpture was of a 30-foot alligator wielding a guitar. \n \n Stavis\u2019 brother, Erick Yingling, recently visited her in New Orleans. He said his sister had created a broad, de facto family that went beyond actual kin to include \u201cmusicians and misfits, entrepreneurs and artists, community activists and attorneys.\u201d \n \n Now, he said, that entire community was devastated by its sudden loss. \u201cJacqui was our heart,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cJacqui will be missed by many, many people, because she got along with everyone. I can\u2019t tell you how much we\u2019ll miss her,\u201d said her grandmother, Barbara Rushmore, 91, of Provincetown, who said she sent love to the two women who were injured in the incident. She expressed hope that her granddaughter would be buried within visiting range of her, perhaps in the cemetery that edges the family home in Provincetown. ||||| Deputies got a call around 10:00 p.m. on Friday that three people had been hurt in a lightning strike. \n \n When they arrived, they found Stavis was unresponsive. Her two companions, both women, were suffering from electric shock injuries. \n \n The department didn\u2019t identify the two other women, but said one was 30 and one was 24. \n \n The Labrador was also killed in the strike, according to authorities.",

After the Rolling Stone campus rape story unraveled, readers of all publications can be forgiven for questioning the process by which Americans get our news. And now it turns out that another blockbuster story is\u2014to quote its subject in an exclusive Observer interview\u2014\u201dnot true.\u201d \n \n Monday\u2019s edition of New York magazine includes an irresistible story about a Stuyvesant High senior named Mohammed Islam who had made a fortune investing in the stock market. Reporter Jessica Pressler wrote regarding the precise number, \u201cThough he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the \ufffd?high eight figures.\u2019 \u201d The New York Post followed up with a story of its own, with the fat figure playing a key role in the headline: \u201cHigh school student scores $72M playing the stock market.\u201d \n \n And now it turns out, the real number is \u2026 zero. \n \n In an exclusive interview with Mr. Islam and his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov, who also featured heavily in the New York story, the baby-faced boys who dress in suits with tie clips came clean. Swept up in a tide of media adulation, they made the whole thing up. \n \n Speaking at the offices of their newly hired crisis pr firm, 5WPR, and handled by a phalanx of four, including the lawyer Ed Mermelstein of RheemBell & Mermelstein, Mr. Islam told a story that will be familiar to just about any 12th grader\u2014a fib turns into a lie turns into a rumor turns into a bunch of mainstream media stories and invitations to appear on CNBC. \n \n Here\u2019s how it happened. \n \n Observer: What was your first contact with the New York magazine reporter? \n \n Mohammed Islam: My friend\u2019s father worked at New York magazine and he had the reporter contact me. Then she [Jessica Pressler] called me. \n \n You seem to be quoted saying \u201ceight figures.\u201d That\u2019s not true, is it? \n \n No, it is not true. \n \n Is there ANY figure? Have you invested and made returns at all? \n \n No. \n \n So it\u2019s total fiction? \n \n Yes. \n \n Are you interested in investing? How did you get this reputation? \n \n I run an investment club at Stuy High which does only simulated trades. \n \n If you had been playing with real money, would you have done really well? \n \n The simulated trades percentage was extremely high relative to the S&P. \n \n Where did Jessica Pressler come up with the $72 million figure? \n \n I honestly don\u2019t know. The number\u2019s a rumor. \n \n She said \u201chave you made $72 million?\u201d \n \n [I led her to believe] I had made even more than $72 million on the simulated trades. \n \n At this point the PR reps jumped in with Law & Order-style objections. A conference outside the room ensued. Back into the room came Mr. Islam. \n \n All I can say is for the simulated trades, I was very successful. The returns were incredible and outperformed the S&P. \n \n Damir, tell me where you fit into this. \n \n Damir Tulemaganbetov: Well, I got excited by this whole trading thing and I said hey, let me get on board. I heard about this article coming out and Mohammed invited me and I met Jessica. \n \n But you guys are pals outside of this? \n \n We go to social gatherings and friends\u2019 places. \n \n Are you into stock-picking as well? \n \n I haven\u2019t been into it but I\u2019m interested. \n \n Mohammed, you\u2019re from Queens and you go to this elite public high school. Is this a hobby of your parents as well or would you be the first person in your family to pursue high finance? \n \n Mohammed Islam: In my immediate family, just me. \n \n So what did your parents think when they\u2019re reading that you\u2019ve got $72 million? \n \n Mohammed Islam: Honestly, my dad wanted to disown me. My mom basically said she\u2019d never talk to me. Their morals are that if I lie about it and don\u2019t own up to it then they can no longer trust me. \u2026 They knew it was false and they basically wanted to kill me and I haven\u2019t spoken to them since. \n \n You haven\u2019t? Where did you sleep last night? \n \n Mohammed Islam: At a friend\u2019s house. But we didn\u2019t sleep. \n \n Damir Tulemaganbetov: We stayed awake all night. We\u2019ve been checking out news all over the world. \n \n Are your friends blowing up your phones? \n \n Damir Tulemaganbetov: He had 297 unread messages and 190 LinkedIn. All the friends shared it. \n \n Mohammed Islam: It was hyped up beyond belief. \n \n Damir Tulemaganbetov: We were at CNBC. That\u2019s why we\u2019re dressed up. But we were there and literally in the building stressing out. We had 20 minutes. Then we three times asked them could we have 20 seconds to talk? \n \n [The boys ended up cancelling the CNBC appearance.] \n \n Where do you go from here? \n \n Damir Tulemaganbetov: Socially, people will be mad about it. But we\u2019re sorry. Especially to our parents. Like my dad would read this and be like, \u201cOh my God,\u201d because he\u2019s a very humble man and I portrayed him like a bad father. \n \n Mohammed Islam: At school, first things first. I am incredibly sorry for any misjudgment and any hurt I caused. The people I\u2019m most sorry for is my parents. I did something where I can no longer gain their trust. I have one sister, two years younger, and we don\u2019t really talk. \n \n So that\u2019s that. There was no $72 million, no \u201ceight figures,\u201d not even one figure. The story is already coming unglued as the commenters on New York\ufffd?s site hammer the reporter for even thinking this was possible. New York has now altered its headline to back away from the $72 million figure but the story itself remains. Even if this working-class kid had somehow started with $100,000 as a high school freshman on day one at Stuy High, he\u2019d have needed to average a compounded annualized return of something like 796 percent over the three years since. C\u2019mon, man. \n \n It\u2019s not hard to see why the story was tough to resist for New York, which placed Mr. Islam\u2019s alleged acumen at No. 12 in its 10th annual \u201cReasons to Love New York\u201d issue. Ms. Pressler quoted him saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not just about money. We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers \u2026\u201d Yep, nothing says success\u2014or search engine optimization\u2014quite like \u201cKoch brothers.\u201d \n \n No one asked for my opinion, but I\u2019m going to provide it anyway, having sat with these kids for a good bit on a tough day. They got carried away. They\u2019re not children. But they\u2019re not quite adults, either, and at least Mr. Islam was literally quaking as we spoke. So yeah, they probably should have known better. But New York and the New York Post probably should have, as well. This story smelled fishy the instant it appeared and a quick dance with the calculator probably would have saved these young men\u2014and a couple reporters\u2014some embarrassment. ||||| \n \n \n \n Editor's Note: In the most recent edition of New York, its annual Reasons to Love New York issue, the magazine published this story about a Stuyvesant High School senior named Mohammed Islam, who was rumored to have made $72 million trading stocks. Islam said his net worth was in the \"high eight figures.\" As part of the research process, the magazine sent a fact-checker to Stuyvesant, where Islam produced a document that appeared to be a Chase bank statement attesting to an eight-figure bank account. After the story's publication, people questioned the $72 million figure in the headline, which was written by editors based on the rumored figure. The headline was amended. But in an interview with the New York Observer last night, Islam now says his entire story was made up. A source close to the Islam family told the Washington Post that the statements were falsified. We were duped. Our fact-checking process was obviously inadequate; we take full responsibility and we should have known better. New York apologizes to our readers. \n \n Rumors, on Wall Street, can be powerful. A whisper can turn into a current that moves markets, driving a stock price up or sending it tumbling. There may be only one other place where gossip holds such sway, and that is high school. \n \n Late last year, a rumor began circulating at Stuyvesant that a junior named Mohammed Islam had made a fortune in the stock market. Not a small fortune, either. Seventy-two million. \n \n An unbelievable amount of money for anyone, not least a high-school student, but as far as rumors go, this one seemed legit. Everyone at Stuy knew that Mohammed, the soft-spoken son of Bengali immigrants from Queens and the president of the school\u2019s Investment Club, was basically a genius. \n \n As the news spread, Mo\u2019s stock went up. The school paper profiled him, Business Insider included him on a list of \u201c20 Under 20,\u201d and Mo became \u201ca celebrity,\u201d as his friend Damir Tulemaganbetov put it on a recent Friday night at Mari Vanna near Union Square. \u201cA VIP!\u201d \n \n Mo, a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux-hawk, smiled shyly. \u201cHe\u2019s quiet today,\u201d said Patrick Trablusi, who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses. \u201cHumble.\u201d And tired: \u201cThis is our third meeting of the day,\u201d Damir said, signaling to the waitress for another round. \u201cWe saw a real-estate agent, a lawyer, you \u2026\u201d \n \n \u201cNext we\u2019re going to see a hedge-fund guy,\u201d Patrick said. The friends locked eyes and started to giggle. \n \n \u201cHe basically wants to give us $150 million,\u201d Mo explained, a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks. \n \n The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks. \u201cFreshly squeezed apple juice,\u201d Damir said, passing them around. \u201cIt\u2019s very good. Do you like caviar?\u201d \n \n After Mo became a celebrity, things got a little awkward at school. (\u201cAren\u2019t you the kid who made all that money?\u201d a teacher asked him.) So he \u201creconnected\u201d with kids from his old school, Allen-Stevenson. One of them introduced him to Patrick, an aspiring financier, who introduced him to Damir at a poker game attended by kids whose parents are, according to Damir, \u201cthe one percent of the one percent.\u201d \n \n The son of a Kazakh oligarch, Damir is tall, slim, and cocky, like a cigarette wearing a fedora. \u201cI call the poker game \u2018Destiny,'\"he said. The waitress arrived with a plate. \u201cHere, have some caviar.\u201d \n \n Over late nights out and dinners at Morimoto, the three hatched a plan to start a hedge fund. \u201cThere are a lot of steps we have to follow through,\u201d said Patrick, calling to mind a more serious Chuck Bass. \u201cBut we\u2019re on the right track.\u201d They plan to launch in June, after Mo turns 18 and can get his broker-dealer license. \u201cMo\u2019s our maestro,\u201d Patrick said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be earning the big bucks. We\u2019re just going to try to fill his needs.\u201d \n \n All three plan to attend college next year, but they\u2019re not concerned about classes getting in the way of their goal: \u201cA billion dollars!\u201d Damir said. \u201cBy next year!\u201d Mo affirmed the number with a nod. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just about money,\u201d he added. \u201cWe want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence, like the Koch brothers \u2026\u201d \n \n \u201cLike in Wolf of Wall Street!\u201d Damir interjected. \u201cAnd Mo is Jordan Belfort.\u201d \n \n \u201cNo, but, not like that,\u201d Patrick said, blanching slightly. \n \n Like Belfort, Mo started with penny stocks. A cousin showed him how to trade. He loved the feeling of risk\u2014the way his hand shook making the trade\u2014but he swore it off after losing a chunk of the money he\u2019d made tutoring. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the balls for it,\u201d he said. He was 9. \n \n It was a while before he was ready to try again. In the meantime, he became a scholar of modern finance, studying up on hedge-fund managers. He was particularly enamored of Paul Tudor Jones. \u201cI had been paralyzed by my loss,\u201d Mo said. \u201cBut he was able to go back to it, even after losing thousands of dollars over and over. Paul Tudor Jones says, \u2018You learn more from your losses than from your gains.\u2019 \u201d Mo got into trading oil and gold, and his bank account grew. Though he is shy about the $72 million number, he confirmed his net worth is in the \u201chigh eight figures.\u201d More than enough to rent an apartment in Manhattan\u2014though his parents won\u2019t let him live in it until he turns 18\u2014and acquire a BMW, which he can\u2019t drive because he doesn\u2019t yet have a license. Thus, it falls to his father to drive him past Tudor Jones\u2019s Greenwich house for inspiration. \u201cIt\u2019s because he is who he is that made me who I am today,\u201d Mo said. \n \n Which is to say: a believer in Wall Street. \u201cA lot of young people do start-ups, but I think it\u2019s a bubble. Trading and investments will always be there. Money will always be rotating\u2014\u201d \n \n \u201cMoney never sleeps!\u201d Damir added. \u201cThat\u2019s from the Wall Street movie.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt all comes down to this,\u201d Mo continued. \u201cWhat makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don\u2019t keep going, there\u2019s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.\u201d \n \n The check arrived for the caviar and apple juice. It totaled $400. \n \n \u201cNew York, that\u2019s where the money\u2019s at,\u201d Damir shouted, pulling out a credit card. \n \n This reminded me of an old joke about robbing banks because that\u2019s where the money is. Damir grinned. \u201cMy father has a quote,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really dope: \u2018You can rob a bank with a gun, but you can rob the whole world with a bank.\u2019 \u201d \n \n Patrick buried his face in his hands. \u201cAt the end of the day,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019re young kids.\u201d",

As the headline of reporter Jessica Pressler's piece proclaimed, \"Because a Stuyvesant Senior Made $72 Million Trading Stocks on His Lunch Break.\" Except the 17-year-old totally didn't, Mohammed now tells the Observer's Ken Kurson. In an interview that took place in the offices of his newly engaged PR firm, with a lawyer by his side, Mohammed says \"No, No, Yes\" as answers to the following: Did he, as Pressler wrote, make eight figures? Has he invested and made anything off it? Is the story complete fiction? He tells the Observer that he does run an investment club at his school, and that his simulated trades' return was pretty impressive. And, yeah, he did lead Pressler to believe \"I had made even more than $72 million on the simulated trades.\" But as the head of his new PR firm says in a statement to NBC News, \"A 17-year old boy who lives in Elmhurst, Queens, responded to a reporter's inquiry and created an inaccurate story. ...

Dr. Lars Spetz told reporters the teacher had been stabbed in the abdomen while the two students were stabbed in the abdomen, liver and chest. \n \n \"They hover between life and death,\" Spetz said. \n \n Swedish media said the school held a meeting Thursday morning to discuss teachers' fears that they could not control access to the school. The Dagens Nyheter newspaper said students must go through a public cafe to reach the school's cafeteria and other parts of the building. \n \n Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven, who went to the scene, described Thursday as a \"black day.\" \n \n \"My thoughts go out to the victims and their families, the students and staff, and the whole community that has been affected,\" Lofven said. \"No words can describe what they are going through right now.\" \n \n King Carl XVI Gustaf said Sweden was \"in shock\" following the attack and that the royal family received the news \"with great dismay and sadness.\" ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption The suspect apparently posed for photos with pupils ahead of the attack \n \n A masked man armed with a sword has killed a pupil and a teacher at a school in Sweden. \n \n The suspect, clad in black, apparently posed for photos with students ahead of the attack, in the western town of Trollhattan. \n \n Two further victims, a pupil and a teacher, are seriously injured.

Ocampo a former Marine accused of murder in the deaths of four homeless men, a woman and her son has died... (Associated Press) \n \n Itzcoatl (ihts-KWAH'-tehl) Ocampo, 25, apparently accumulated the cleaning product over time while in custody, said his attorney, Michael Molfetta, who was briefed on the death. The incident raises serious questions about how well Orange County jail deputies were supervising Ocampo, who had mental health issues, Molfetta said. \n \n Ocampo was found shaking and vomiting in his single-man cell Wednesday and taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead Thursday afternoon, said Orange County sheriff's Lt. Jeff Hallock. \n \n No cause of death was immediately given, and officials said an autopsy will be performed in the coming days. The Orange County district attorney's office will investigate the death and autopsy results by an independent pathologist are expected by the middle of next week, Hallock said. \n \n \"If you spend three minutes with Ocampo, you are acutely aware of the fact that he has some mental issues. They were severe and they were obvious and they definitely were not contrived,\" Molfetta said. \"With that being said, this was a guy who should have garnered the highest level of scrutiny ... and it wasn't done.\" \n \n Hallock declined to comment on inmate supervision or the attorney's account except to say jail deputies are required, in general, to walk by each inmate's cell a minimum of once an hour. \n \n \"We always want to prove the case in court and have justice for the victims' families,\" said Susan Kang Schroeder, the district attorney's chief of staff. \n \n Marie Middaugh, mother of victim Lloyd \"Jimmy\" Middaugh, said in a phone interview Friday that she was relieved to hear the news of Ocampo's death. \n \n \"A trial wouldn't have brought our loved ones back,\" she said. \"I'm sorry things happened the way it did for his family because I know they're grieving, too, but I'm just glad that really it's all over.\" \n \n Someone at a number listed for Ocampo's father hung up repeatedly when a reporter called Friday. \n \n Prosecutors alleged that Ocampo, a native of Mexico, stabbed four homeless men in what they called a serial thrill-kill rampage in late 2011 and early 2012. Ocampo targeted his homeless victims because they were vulnerable and because he felt they were a blight on the community, authorities said. \n \n He was charged in January 2012 with four counts of murder, with special allegations of multiple murders, lying in wait and use of a deadly weapon. Three victims were stabbed more than 40 times each with a single-edged blade at least 7 inches long. In one instance, prosecutors, said, Ocampo selected as his next victim a homeless man who was featured in a Los Angeles Times story about the killings. \n \n Ocampo, who was discharged from the Marines in 2010, also was facing murder charges in the deaths of a school friend's mother and brother in October 2011. \n \n At the time, his family said Ocampo was a troubled man after he returned from Iraq in 2008 and he went to visit the grave of a friend who died in combat in Afghanistan twice a week. He also began drinking heavily and he suffered from headaches and hand tremors, they said. \n \n His parents separated in 2010 and his father became homeless after losing his job. During the killing rampage, Ocampo visited his father on the streets and warned him about the dangers of being homeless, even showing him a picture of one of the dead men. \n \n In March 2012, Ocampo temporarily was placed on suicide watch after he began banging his head on a metal toilet in the jail. He told his attorney he was trying to stop voices as well as headaches and twitches that were bothering him, according to The Orange County Register. ||||| A man charged last year in a \"serial thrill-kill\" rampage in Orange County that left six people dead, including four homeless men and a woman and her son, died Thursday after being found sick in his jail cell, a sheriff's spokesman said. \n \n Deputies found Itzcoatl \"Izzy\" Ocampo, 25, ill in his single-man cell about 6:35 p.m. Wednesday at Central Jail in Santa Ana, said Lt. Jeff Hallock. Medical staff at the jail attended to him, and paramedics transported him to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, Hallock said. \n \n Ocampo died at the hospital about 1:30 p.m. Thursday, Hallock said. The Orange County district attorney's office is investigating, as is routine with in-custody deaths, he said. The probe will probably take several weeks. \n \n Orange County prosecutors were seeking the death penalty against Ocampo, who was scheduled to appear in court for a pre-trial hearing in January. His death means that the relatives of those killed will not have the chance to see him held accountable, said district attorney's spokeswoman Susan Kang Schroeder. \n \n \"It really deprives the victims and the people of California of the ability to put Mr. Ocampo to death on our terms and get justice for the victims of these crimes,\" she said. \n \n His defense attorney, Randall Longwith, said in an email that he would have no comment \"until we learn all the facts.\" \n \n Last year, Longwith told The Times that his client had been behaving erratically and complained that he heard voices. He said Ocampo suffered from tics and headaches. \n \n For months Ocampo went undetected, authorities said, as a string of killings occurred in North Orange County, starting with the stabbing death of his childhood friend and the friend's mother on Oct. 25, 2011. Raquel Estrada, 53, and Juan Herrera, 34, were stabbed and left to die on the floor of their Yorba Linda home, prosecutors alleged. \n \n The killings continued on the streets with the slayings of homeless men. \n \n James Patrick McGillivray, 53, was killed near a shopping center in Placentia on Dec. 20, 2011. Several days later, Lloyd Middaugh, 42, was found dead near a riverbed in Anaheim. Paulus \"Dutch\" Smit, 57, was slain outside the Yorba Linda library on Dec. 30, 2011. \n \n Police said Ocampo stalked a fourth homeless man, John Berry, 64, for several days after seeing his photograph in the Los Angeles Times. On Jan. 13, 2012, Ocampo ambushed Berry in a parking lot and stabbed him to death, authorities said. Police said a witness chased Ocampo into a mobile home park, where he was captured. \n \n Investigators said he used the same Ka-bar Bull Dozier knife in the killings of all four homeless men. \n \n Members of Ocampo's family said after his arrest that they could not believe he could be the killer who had struck such fear into the homeless population. They said the former Marine from Yorba Linda was generous to the homeless and frequently gave food and money to panhandlers. \n \n But prosecutors said Ocampo selected homeless men and stalked them. He set a personal goal of 16 slayings, authorities said. \n \n Ocampo told police after his arrest that he targeted the homeless because they were \"available and vulnerable\" and that he believed he was performing a public service because their presence was a \"blight\" on the community. \n \n An Anaheim detective told grand jurors that Ocampo's \"demeanor would change, and he seemed to get excited\" as he described the attacks to police. Ocampo told detectives he joined the Marine Corps in 2006 with the hope of learning to kill, but he was disappointed that during a six-month tour in Iraq he drove a water truck and never saw combat, according to the transcript of the grand jury hearing. \n \n When Ocampo was asked what sort of consequences he deserved, the detective told grand jurors, Ocampo answered without hesitation: the death penalty \u2014 lethal injection \u2014 or \"whatever is quickest.\" \n \n hailey.branson@latimes.com \n \n Times Staff Writers Nicole Santa Cruz and Christopher Goffard contributed to this report.",

McIlroy is currently sidelined from competitive golf with a stress fracture in his rib but says he decided to tough it out when he got the invite Saturday night to play with the president. McIlroy isn't the only professional golfer to have weighed in on Trump's game. Tiger Woods has previously said Trump \"takes a pretty good lash\" for a man his age. But like anything having to do with Trump, Sunday's golf game wasn't without controversy. USA Today reports McIlroy took some heat on the Internet; some pointed out that he had ducked out of the most recent Olympics because they were \"too political.\" On Trump's side, the White House was caught downplaying how much golf the president is playing, according to Politico.

    "document": "404 Not found \n \n \u2014 Police are asking property owners in this city and throughout nearby rural Albemarle County to look for any signs of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, hoping that they can locate her after nearly two weeks of searching. \n \n Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy J. Longo said during a news conference Thursday that searchers have combed through most of this college town and are now moving south into surrounding farms and woodland. He also urged real estate agents and others to look in and around vacant homes and buildings in an effort to find the 18-year-old, who has been missing since Sept. 13. \n \n Longo said Graham had an iPhone 5S with a pink case that has not been found, and he said people should report anything they see that seems out of the ordinary on their properties, including unexpected tire tracks, clothing or other evidence that might help police find her. \n \n \u201cWe have no idea where she is, despite our best efforts,\u201d Longo said. \u201cEveryone realizes the more time that goes by, the more difficult this is going to come for everyone. I can\u2019t lose hope until I have to, until I need to, until it\u2019s appropriate to transition this into some other type of operation. I have hope, and I think Hannah\u2019s mom and dad have hope.\u201d \n \n Longo said in an interview Thursday that he wants anyone who knows Jesse L. \u201cLJ\u201d Matthew Jr., 32, who is charged with abducting Graham, to help identify spots that Matthew frequented. Police asked for help finding \u00adplaces where Matthew likes to fish, for example. A reward of $100,000 is being offered for information leading to the safe return of the 18-year-old U-Va. sophomore from Fairfax County. \n \n Charlottesville investigators arrived Thursday in Galveston, Tex., where Matthew appeared in court after he was arrested on a beach Wednesday afternoon. Longo said Charlottesville police will not approach Matthew about the case because he has invoked his right to consult with an attorney. Local authorities said they would try to speak with him late Thursday or early Friday, and they were searching his car for evidence. \n \n Matthew is the last person known to have seen Graham, and he has been charged with abduction with intent to sexually assault her. Police have not detailed what evidence they have against him. Matthew was taken into custody Wednesday in Texas after a widespread manhunt, and police said he will be extradited to Charlottesville to face charges in her disappearance. \n \n Early Thursday, Matthew appeared briefly in a Texas courtroom, where a judge denied bond and read Matthew his rights. Matthew declined a court- \n \n appointed attorney and waived an extradition hearing. \n \n Charlottesville lawyer James L. Camblos III, who is representing Matthew, said that he spoke to Matthew by phone late Wednesday, after his arrest. \n \n \u201cHe sounded okay considering the circumstances,\u201d Camblos said. \u201cHe called me from the jail and, under the circumstances, he sounded pretty good.\u201d \n \n Longo said it is unclear why Matthew was in the Galveston area, a popular summer destination on the Gulf of Mexico southeast of Houston and about 1,300 miles from Charlottesville. A Galveston County deputy found Matthew after the sheriff\u2019s office received a call from a woman who saw Matthew on the beach \u2014 in Gilchrist, on the Bolivar Peninsula \u2014 and found him suspicious. \n \n The deputy noticed that Matthew had set up a tent on the beach, sheriff\u2019s Capt. Barry Cook said. Matthew initially gave a false name, but the deputy ran the license plates on Matthew\u2019s car and discovered that he was wanted in Virginia, Cook said. Matthew was taken into custody without incident. \n \n [See a map of the region where Matthew was apprehended.] \n \n Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset said Thursday that deputies have examined the car and surrounding sand dunes and will widen their search, but that they have no indication of where Graham might be. \n \n \u201cThis individual has a 1,300-mile track,\u201d the sheriff said, referring to Matthew\u2019s trip from Charlottesville to east Texas. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of area to look at.\u201d \n \n It is unclear what ties, if any, Matthew might have to Texas. He grew up in the Charlottesville area and attended two Virginia universities \u2014 Liberty from 2000 to 2002 and then Christopher Newport in 2003. He played football at both schools and left both schools. Officials at the school would not discuss the circumstances of his departure, citing privacy rules. \n \n Also on Thursday, the owner of the restaurant where Graham was last seen said that Graham never entered the establishment with her alleged abductor, instead waiting outside for him while he purchased drinks. \n \n Brice Cunningham, owner of the upscale Tempo Restaurant in Charlottesville, said he saw Matthew for the first time at the restaurant late on Friday, Sept. 12, and then again during the early hours of Sept. 13. Cunningham said that Matthew drank shots of bourbon with two other customers about 11:45 p.m., and that he then saw Matthew enjoying music on the restaurant\u2019s dance floor. \n \n Cunningham said that Matthew, who was not a regular at the bar, appeared to be having a good time that evening. \n \n \u201cHe wasn\u2019t aggressive, he wasn\u2019t unpleasant,\u201d said Cunningham, 43. \u201cHe seemed friendly and was talking to people.\u201d \n \n Cunningham said that Matthew left the bar briefly and returned just after 1 a.m., closed a tab for two beers at 1:10 a.m. and then left sometime after that. He said that Tempo staffers, who were checking identification to ensure that patrons were at least 21 years old, saw Graham outside the bar and thought she appeared intoxicated. They saw her leave with Matthew on foot. \n \n \u201cNone of my staff saw her inside that night,\u201d Cunningham said in an interview Thursday. In a statement, Cunningham said that Graham was not served alcohol. \u201cShe was, however, noticed by the door person outside the restaurant at that time, and seen leaving with Matthew shortly thereafter.\u201d \n \n Graham had been seen on surveillance video walking with Matthew shortly after 1 a.m. on the city\u2019s Downtown Mall, headed in the direction of Tempo. Friends said her last text to them was at 1:06 a.m., just minutes before Matthew got to Tempo. The owner\u2019s account suggests that Graham arrived at the restaurant with Matthew, waited for him outside, and then left with him. \n \n The account differs from what police have said about Graham\u2019s interactions with Matthew at Tempo. Longo said Thursday that his investigators \u201chave at least one witness statement that puts Hannah Graham inside the bar with Mr. Matthew. You\u2019re always evaluating witness statements in an ongoing investigation, and we will be talking to folks again, but we have that statement.\u201d \n \n An extensive search has turned up almost no trace of Graham after she was seen at Tempo. Police have collected evidence from Matthew\u2019s car and apartment, and Longo said that prosecutors decided to press charges against Matthew after reviewing evidence from experts at the crime lab in Richmond. The charge against Matthew suggests that police believe Matthew took Graham against her will \u2014 or while she was in a state that left her unable to consent. \n \n Those close to Matthew, who is 6-foot-2 and weighs 270 pounds, have said they know him as a \u201cgentle giant\u201d who prayed at a local church, worked at the U-Va. hospital caring for patients and volunteered at the private Covenant School as a football coach. \n \n Flaherty and Jouvenal reported from Washington. ||||| Thank you for Reading. \n \n Please purchase a subscription to continue reading. \n \n A subscription is required to continue reading. \n \n Thank you for reading 5 free articles.

(Associated Press) \n \n Jill Howard, left, and her stepdaughter Martie Belt, talk about the arrest of Leroy Matthew Jr. as they walk along the beach Thursday, Sept. 25, 2014, near Gilchrist, Texas, on the Bolivar Peninsula.... (Associated Press) \n \n The island's beaches have served as a hiding spot for centuries: graves from one of the Houston area's most notorious mass slayings and a haven for the famed French pirate Jean Lafitte. \n \n \"We seem to be the end of the road,\" Sheriff Henry Trochesset said. \n \n Matthew was arrested Wednesday as a suspect in the abduction of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham. He waived extradition Thursday in Galveston. \n \n His arrest \u2014 initially for refusing to identify himself to authorities \u2014 came after a phone tip from a resident who saw the 6-foot-2, 270-pound man with dreadlocks and recognized him from TV. A deputy then spotted him camped out on the beach. \n \n It's not uncommon to see random tents on the barren beaches, nor for sheriff's deputies to encounter people who don't want to identify themselves, Trochesset said. \n \n \"We get lots of weird folks,\" Rob Faupel, 45, an air conditioning technician, said. \"It seems like a good place to seek refuge. It's kind of remote.\" \n \n Only one road leads to the peninsula from the mainland to the east, a two-lane state highway south of Interstate 10 that ends at the Gulf of Mexico and heads west toward Galveston. Repeated storms wiped out the old highway Texas 87 that bordered the seashore and led to Port Arthur and Beaumont at the far southeast corner of the state. Motorists coming from Galveston and Houston must take a 20-minute ferry ride across Galveston Bay. \n \n As far as the campers, beach maintenance crew member Cliff Reichel said, \"We don't bother them unless they flat out are doing something wrong.\" \n \n Reichel, 62, of Galveston, recalled one woman who was noteworthy because she had puppets on stakes outside her tent. She stayed for five months, then abruptly left. \n \n \"You get people who stay a month at a time, a week at a time,\" his partner, Jacob Huffstetler, 25, of nearby High Island, added. \n \n Becky Sosa, who works at Miss Nancy's Bait Camp in Gilchrist not far from the beach, agreed that Matthew might have easily gone unnoticed. \n \n \"He would fit right in,\" said the 54-year-old Sosa. \"We get some strange ones that come through here. Some have stayed. It's like a magnet.\" \n \n She thought it was possible that Matthew had bought cigarettes from her on Tuesday, but she couldn't be sure because it was a busy day with fishing customers. \"I would have thought nothing about it,\" she added. \n \n In the early 1970s, authorities recovered seven bodies from a Bolivar beach at High Island, one of three mass graves used by serial killer Dean Corll. His 28-victim killing spree ended when accomplice Elmer Wayne Henley Jr. killed him in August 1973. \n \n \"It's kind of scary,\" Jill Howard, 56, of Arlington, said, recalling the infamous killings while walking the beach Thursday with her stepdaughter. But she said she could understand how someone trying to avoid capture would head out to \"this beach out in the boonies.\"",

It's kind of remote.\" More on the case from the Washington Post and the Daily Progress: Matthew initially said he was \"George Carr,\" but police discovered his true identity when they ran his car's plates. Authorities have searched the car, beach, and sand dunes. The case has brought to light another accusation against Matthew. An official has confirmed he was accused of raping a woman at Liberty University in 2002, but she didn't proceed with the case. He was a student there at the time. \"Basically, the woman was saying she hadn't consented and Matthew was saying she had,\" says an attorney with the Lynchburg Commonwealth Attorney's Office. Searchers have scoured much of Charlottesville, Va., and are moving on to surrounding farms and woodland. They've asked area real estate agents to inspect any vacant buildings or properties they represent, and have told the public to be on the lookout for Graham's iPhone 5S with a pink case or unexplained tire tracks. Authorities are also looking to identify some of Matthew's favorite fishing spots. Matthew has declined to fight his extradition, and Virginia police have been sent to retrieve him.

The Center saves these animals and educates the public about these special members of our environment. It is a good value because you get two days for the price of one. I fully recommend this side trip to Yellowstone. Take your camera!!! Great for all age groups. \u2013 Glenn R, TripAdvisor ||||| A grizzly bear that fatally mauled a hiker in Yellowstone National Park was killed after DNA evidence linked the animal to the scene of a second hiker's death a month later, a park official said Monday. \n \n The decision to euthanize the 250-pound (113-kilogram) female bear was meant to protect park visitors and staff, Superintendent Dan Wenk said. \n \n However, the investigation remains open, and officials might never know definitively whether the same bear that killed California hiker Brian Matayoshi on July 7 also took the life of John Wallace of Michigan in August. \n \n Evidence showed multiple bears, including the sow, were near Wallace's body but not if the sow made any contact with Wallace. The bear was allowed to remain free after Matayoshi's death because park officials said it was reacting naturally to defend its two cubs. \n \n \"We made a decision at that time, based on all the information available, that we did not have a bear with a history or a bear that was demonstrating any predatory nature,\" park spokesman Al Nash said. \n \n The deaths of Matayoshi and Wallace were the first blamed on a bear inside the park in a quarter-century. Two fatal maulings occurred just outside the park in 2010. \n \n There were no witnesses to Wallace's killing. He was hiking alone in Yellowstone's Hayden Valley, about eight miles (13 kilometers) from where Matayoshi was killed. The mauling occurred in a backcountry area frequented by bears, and signs posted at trailheads warned visitors to take precautions. \n \n By the time Wallace was found by other hikers a day after the mauling, one or more bears had fed upon his body, Nash said. Authorities couldn't determine from the evidence whether the sow bear \"attacked Mr. Wallace or came upon the scene subsequent to the attack, but we certainly know the bear was at the scene,\" he said. \n \n The sow bear was linked to the scene through DNA analysis of hair and scat samples found near Wallace's body, Nash said. \n \n The two cubs were captured and relocated to the Grizzly and Wolf Discovery Center in West Yellowstone. \n \n In the aftermath of Wallace's death, park officials said they did not believe the responsible grizzly was the same one that had killed Matayoshi because they found no cub tracks at the scene. Investigators now believe those tracks might have washed away in a rain storm that went through the area before Wallace's body was discovered. \n \n Chris Servheen, a grizzly bear recovery coordinator with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said investigators have concluded the sow bear was at the scene for some time. He said details would be released when investigators complete their report into the attack, which is expected to take another month. \n \n Servheen also said park officials had made the best decision they could after Matayoshi's death, given the circumstances. \n \n Since the mauling, park officials have captured at least seven bears in the Hayden Valley. DNA, tracks and other evidence from the scene showed at least nine bears were present around the general time of Wallace's death, drawn by two nearby bison carcasses. \n \n All of the captured bears were radio collared and released. \n \n An estimated 600 grizzlies live in the greater Yellowstone area, which includes parts of Wyoming, Montana and Wyoming. A recent report showed run-ins between humans and that growing bear population reached record levels last year, with 295 conflicts recorded by researchers. \n \n Three of every four of those involved bears killing livestock or damaging property to get food, garbage, livestock feed or other human-related foods. Nine human injuries were reported in 2010 _ almost double the long-term average of five a year.",

    "document": "CLOSE Here is the full audio of Chuck Grassley's answer to a Des Moines Register reporter's question concerning the estate tax. The \"booze or women or movies\" quote begins at the 4:10 mark. Jason Noble/The Register \n \n Reporters wait for the arrival of senators for vote on the tax bill on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. on December 1, 2017. (Photo: MARI MATSURI, AFP/Getty Images) \n \n If the tax reform packages that have now passed the U.S. House and Senate become law, at least one thing appears likely: The federal estate tax will be slashed and perhaps eliminated altogether. \n \n That will represent a victory for Republicans in Iowa\u2019s congressional delegation, who have consistently opposed the tax and argued it unfairly lumps in the state\u2019s farmers with some of the country\u2019s richest families. \n \n But a review of federal tax data and nonpartisan research on the subject shows that family farmers and small business owners represent a tiny share of estate tax payers, and that the taxes they owe rarely force them to sell land or quit farming. \n \n The number of Iowans paying the estate tax actually numbers in the dozens each year, out of roughly 1.4 million who file federal tax returns each year. IRS data from the last five years shows the number of Iowa taxpayers owing estate taxes ranged from 32 in 2012 to 61 in 2015, and that the vast majority of those probably were not farmers or small business owners. \n \n Buy Photo Protesters gather outside the Neil Smith Federal Building in downtown Des Moines Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2017, to protest the Republican Tax Reform Plan. (Photo: Rodney White/The Register) \n \n Despite that evidence, U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a member of the tax-writing Finance Committee in the Senate, has long presented the estate tax as a potentially ruinous burden on farmers and small business owners. \n \n \u201cThe federal estate tax may force family members to liquidate to pay the death tax,\u201d Grassley said in a statement released earlier this year. \u201cIt\u2019s harder than ever for families to pass down the family-run farm or business from one generation to the next. The death tax creates financial hardship for family businesses to survive and thrive.\u201d \n \n The estate tax is a 40 percent tax on wealth assessed when a person dies, and currently is applied to assets above $5.5 million for individuals and $11 million for couples. The House and Senate bills double those exemptions to $11 million and $22 million, and the House version abolishes the tax completely in 2024. \n \n \u201c\u201cI think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing, as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it\u2019s on booze or women or movies.\u201d\u201d U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa \n \n In a statement after the House bill passed, U.S. Rep. Steve King, a Republican from Iowa\u2019s ag-heavy 4th District, cheered the changes, arguing the estate tax \u201coften falls hardest on family-owned farms and small businesses.\u201d \n \n Likewise, U.S. Rep. David Young, a Republican whose district includes the Des Moines metro, has highlighted changes to what Republicans often call the \u201cdeath tax.\u201d \n \n In a newsletter sent on Friday, Young called it a \"myth\" that \"repealing the estate tax is a massive giveaway to the wealthiest Americans.\" \n \n Rather, he wrote, \"The estate tax (sometimes called the death tax) negatively impacts farms and businesses all over the 3rd District. ... Death should not be a taxable event and families should not have to fear the Internal Revenue Service and more taxes making it more difficult and costly to pass on the farm or family business to the next generation.\" \n \n That view, in fact, has been a GOP talking point for a generation or more. President George W. Bush made the exact argument in 2001 when pushing tax cuts that raised the estate tax exemption and lowered rates. \n \n \u201cTo keep farms in the family, we are going to get rid of the death tax,\u201d Bush declared back then. \n \n CLOSE Senate Republicans have approved a massive tax overhaul that provides more than $1 trillion in tax cuts over ten years. USA TODAY \n \n Few farmers affected \n \n The arguments from Grassley, Young, King and others, however, don\u2019t match the reality found in federal tax data \u2013 particularly for Iowa. \n \n The estate tax applies to around 5,000 taxpayers across the entire country each year, and very few of them come from Iowa. Of the Iowans subject to the tax, only a fraction are actually farmers, and a vanishingly small number of them face a tax bill requiring them to sell off farmland or other assets. \n \n Buy Photo Paula Egan of Des Moines stands with protesters gathered outside the Neil Smith Federal Building in downtown Des Moines Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2017, to protest the Republican Tax Reform Plan. (Photo: Rodney White/The Register) \n \n No data is available breaking down the occupations or asset types held by the Iowans subject to the estate tax. But national data shows farmers and owners of farm assets make up a tiny share of estate tax payers. \n \n According to IRS data from 2016, just 682 tax filers in the entire country who owed estate taxes owned any farm assets. That represents about 13 percent of the 5,219 estate tax returns in which taxes were owed. \n \n And even that figure likely overstates the number of primarily farm operations subject to the tax. A 2015 report from the Congressional Research Service projects that just 65 farm estates annually across the U.S. face an estate tax liability. Less than a quarter of these, the congressional report finds, have insufficient cash to pay their tax bills. \n \n A U.S. Department of Agriculture analysis published earlier this year found a somewhat higher number of farm estates owed the tax in 2016: 0.4 percent, or about 160 nationwide. \n \n Kristine Tidgren, the assistant director of the Center for Agricultural Law and Taxation at Iowa State University, said she\u2019s not aware of any Iowa estates forced to sell land since the estate tax exemption was raised to its current level in 2012. \n \n Buy Photo Protesters gather outside the Neil Smith Federal Building in downtown Des Moines Wednesday, Nov. 29, 2017, to protest the Republican Tax Reform Plan. (Photo: Rodney White/The Register) \n \n \u201cI haven\u2019t come across any examples of an Iowa family that had to sell the farm to pay the estate tax,\u201d Tidgren said. \u201cI don\u2019t think the current estate tax system threatens family farmers.\u201d \n \n The USDA report puts hard numbers to the tax liability faced by the few farms subject to the estate tax. \n \n Operations the USDA classifies as small family farms (those with annual income under $350,000) face an average tax bill of about $620,000, or 11 percent of their total value of the estate. For mid-size farms (with annual income between $350,000 and $1 million), the average bill is $3.7 million, or about 24 percent of the estate\u2019s value. \n \n Tidgren said the farmers facing such a bill are typically diversified \u2014 perhaps with an off-farm job or business and liquid assets like stocks and bonds in addition to real estate and equipment. \n \n \u201cWith the price of land, there are some farms in Iowa that definitely have to worry about the estate tax, and they might end up having to pay some,\u201d she said. \u201cBut generally those are larger operations and oftentimes they have other assets outside of the farm property.\u201d \n \n The number of small businesses impacted by the estate tax is similarly small. That same Congressional Research Service report finds about 94 estates annually that hold half or more of their assets in a small business that heirs will continue to operate after the owners die. And fewer than half of these don\u2019t have the cash on hand to pay the tax. \n \n All this means, in essence, is that lawmakers\u2019 argument for abolishing a tax that generates tens of billions of dollars annually is based on the challenges faced by perhaps a few dozen farm estates and a few dozen more small businesses across the entire country. \n \n When asked for data supporting Grassley\u2019s view, his Senate office offered a report from the American Farm Bureau Federation, which showed that rising land values in recent years have increased the number of farms potentially subject to the estate tax. \n \n That report found Iowa farms with as few as 625 acres \u2014 encompassing as much as 30 percent of farms in the state \u2014 could be subject to the tax in 2016. \n \n This analysis overlooks key factors, however. For one, it applies an exemption level of $5 million, which is roughly the exemption for an individual. For married couples, the first $11 million in assets are exempt from the tax. Using the Farm Bureau\u2019s analysis but applying an $11 million exemption suggests only farms with more than about 1,400 acres might face the estate tax. Ten percent or less of Iowa farms are that size. \n \n The Farm Bureau analysis also does not account for various deductions available that can drive an estate\u2019s taxable value below the $5 million threshold. Of the 120 Iowa taxpayers who filed an estate tax return in 2016, 118 claimed deductions and 44 actually owed taxes. \n \n Young, King and 1st District U.S. Rep. Rod Blum voted for the House version of tax reform containing the estate tax repeal. Grassley and Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst likewise voted for the Senate version, and Grassley this year co-sponsored standalone legislation to permanently abolish the estate tax. \n \n In a Nov. 29 interview, Grassley was adamant about the need for change, even if farmers and small business owners represent a tiny minority of estate tax payers. The reason, he said, is as much philosophical as practical. \n \n An estate tax effectively and unfairly taxes a person\u2019s earnings twice, he argued: first when they earn it and again when they die. And, he added, it penalizes savers without touching spenders. \n \n \u201cI think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing,\u201d Grassley said, \u201cas opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it\u2019s on booze or women or movies.\u201d \n \n The seven-term senator runs an operation in Butler County with his son and grandson and frequently describes himself as a farmer. When asked if his own family farm would be subject to the estate tax, Grassley initially said it would not. \n \n Then, after mulling it over a moment, he backtracked, noting that if he and his wife died on the same day the estate would be subject to the $5.5 million exemption rather than the $11 million exemption and likely would have to file an estate tax return. \n \n What the changes might mean \n \n Should the tax reform package ultimately pass with language doubling the exemption or ending it all together, Tidgren said one likely effect would be simplifying farmers\u2019 financial planning. That\u2019s particularly true for those who end up owing little or nothing, but must take complicated steps to get there. \n \n U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Dec. 2, 2017 (Photo: David R. Lutman, Special to Courier Journal) \n \n \u201cThere is a lot of expensive planning going on to try to reduce any liability that you have. That\u2019s just smart business,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the one thing I would say about the proposals on the table is they would definitely reduce the need for the vast majority of our farmers to worry about it at all.\u201d \n \n Grassley echoed that point in a statement to the Des Moines Register, citing estate tax-related planning as a major headache for farmers and business owners. \n \n \u201cFamily farmers, small businesspeople and others that may be affected by the estate tax understand that it is law, so many are forced into spending large sums of their hard-earned dollars on lawyers and accountants to avoid its impact instead of reinvesting in their business,\u201d he said. \u201cThis means that while many don\u2019t end up paying the tax, it still has a negative effect on the economy.\u201d \n \n Beyond that, of course, pulling back or eliminating the estate tax would save billions for the richest Americans. Seventy-two percent of estate tax payments come from the top 1 percent of U.S. taxpayers; 42 percent comes from the top 0.1 percent. \n \n How the estate tax works \n \n The estate tax is a 40 percent tax on assets assessed when a person dies. The rate and income levels subject to the tax have bounced around a lot over the last two decades, but under current law it kicks in on assets above $5.5 million for individuals and $11 million for couples. \n \n How might that play out in real life? Imagine a couple with assets \u2014 property, stocks, cash savings, etc. \u2014 valued at $21 million. When the surviving spouse dies, the estate would owe $4 million in estate taxes \u2014 40 percent of the $10 million above the $11 million exemption. \n \n (This is just an example; there are several available deductions that could drive down the tax liability even further.) \n \n The tax bill that passed the Senate last week doubles the exemption to the tax, so that it\u2019s applied only to an individual\u2019s estate above $11 million or a couple\u2019s estate over $22 million. In the example given above, the couple would no longer be subject to the estate tax at all; their assets are below the $22 million exemption. \n \n The House\u2019s tax reform package, passed in November, is even more generous: It doubles the exemptions starting in 2018 and then abolishes the tax altogether in 2024. \n \n The Senate version would reduce government revenues by $83 billion between 2018 and 2027, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. The House approach would reduce government revenues $150.7 billion over that time. \n \n The House and Senate must now reconcile the differences between their bills and send a final version to President Donald Trump. \n \n Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2nnLxD2 ||||| Grassley: Ending Estate Tax Recognizes Investors Over Spenders \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP \n \n Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, commenting on the GOP tax overhaul, tells The Des Moines Register that ending the estate tax is about rewarding people who invest over those who spend everything they earn on \"booze or women or movies.\" \n \n A promise to end the so-called death tax has been a bulwark of Republican electoral politics for decades. A House version of the bill would do just that by 2024; however, the Senate's version of the tax overhaul, which narrowly passed the chamber early Saturday, would keep it, but instead double the current exemption to $11 million from $5.5 million per individual. For married couples, the current exemption is already at $11 million. \n \n \"I think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing, as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it's on booze or women or movies,\" Grassley, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, told the Register on Saturday. \n \n The senator's remarks elicited a harsh response on social media, with one Twitter user commenting: \"I'm sure those folks would love to invest, but they're a bit preoccupied just trying to make ends meet.\" \n \n The elimination of the estate tax benefits a tiny fraction of taxpayers. The nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates that for 2017, fewer than 2 in 1,000 estates will owe any estate tax, or about 0.2 percent. \n \n Grassley has been an especially strong proponent of ending the estate tax, claiming that it hurts Iowa families trying to pass their farms from one generation to the next. But in an editorial published over the weekend, the Register wrote: \"a review of federal tax data and nonpartisan research on the subject shows that family farmers and small business owners represent a tiny share of estate tax payers, and that the taxes they owe rarely force them to sell land or quit farming.\" \n \n The Hill writes: ||||| \n \n Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) questions Neil M. Gorsuch during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) \n \n As Republicans continue to sell the details of their tax bill, some are reaching for more colorful language to liven up complex policies that tend to put the average voter to sleep. \n \n Case in point: Over the weekend, Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) hashed over the plan with his home state\u2019s largest newspaper, the Des Moines Register. Turning to the party\u2019s idea of doing away with the estate tax, Grassley framed the current law as a hindrance to responsible saving. \n \n \u201cI think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing,\u201d Grassley told the Register in a story published Saturday. \u201cAs opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it\u2019s on booze or women or movies.\u201d \n \n The estate tax, often described by Republicans as the \u201cdeath tax,\u201d is levied only on the very rich, passing on assets of more than $5.5 million for individuals and $11 million for married couples. The current tax on estates is 40 percent of an individual\u2019s wealth at death. \n \n Grassley, a Senate Finance Committee member responsible for writing the tax proposal, was immediately slammed by critics over the comments. \n \n The suggestion \u2014 that anyone not socking away their savings in the bank or investments must be profligately throwing their money away \u2014 played directly into the critique that Republicans are disconnected from the majority of working Americans. \n \n [Analysis: Why aren\u2019t you paying the estate tax?

Sincerely, America \n \n On Monday, Grassley said his point about the estate tax had been taken out of context and sought to expound on his thoughts. \n \n \u201cMy point regarding the estate tax, which has been taken out of context, is that the government shouldn\u2019t seize the fruits of someone\u2019s lifetime of labor after they die,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe question is one of basic fairness, and working to create a tax code that doesn\u2019t penalize frugality, saving and investment. That\u2019s as true for family farmers who have to break up their operations to pay the IRS following the death of a loved one as it is for parents saving for their children\u2019s college education or working families investing and saving for their retirement.\u201d \n \n [Democrats fume over \u2018absurd\u2019 GOP tax bill full of last-minute handwritten edits] \n \n Under the Senate tax plan passed early Saturday morning along partisan lines, the exemptions are raised to $11 million per individual and $22 million per couple. The House version of the bill does the same but also axes the tax completely in 2024. \n \n In Grassley\u2019s home state of Iowa, the estate tax has been particularly fraught with controversy. Republicans have often argued that the 40 percent government tax creates a cost-prohibitive situation for farmers hoping to pass their farms on to heirs. \n \n \u201cDeath should not be a taxable event and families should not have to fear the Internal Revenue Service and more taxes making it more difficult and costly to pass on the farm or family business to the next generation,\u201d Rep. David Young (R), a Des Moines-area congressman, wrote on Friday in a newsletter to constituents. \n \n But according to the Register, the actual numbers do not support that narrative. Citing 2016 data from the IRS, the newspaper determined 5,219 tax returns were affected by the current estate tax. Only 682, or 13 percent, of the tax filers owned farm assets. \n \n The paper also referred to a 2015 report from the Congressional Research Service noting that only 65 farm estates in the United States annually are touched by the estate tax. \n \n Grassley and other congressional Republicans have long maintained that even if farmers are not affected by the tax directly, the planning involved is an additional strain. \n \n \u201c[M]any are forced into spending large sums of their hard-earned dollars on lawyers and accountants to avoid its impact instead of reinvesting in their business,\u201d he told the Register. \u201cThis means that while many don\u2019t end up paying the tax, it still has a negative effect on the economy.\u201d \n \n This post has been updated. \n \n More from Morning Mix: \n \n Billy Bush says there were 8 witnesses to Trump\u2019s \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 comments \n \n James B.

Actually, the senator from Iowa has two, one on principle and the other based on scolding people over how they use their own money. Guess which one got the most attention this weekend? \n \n In comments published by the Des Moines Register on Saturday, Grassley explained why the Senate version of tax reform includes a traditional Republican repeal of the estate tax: \n \n Grassley was adamant about the need for change, even if farmers and small business owners represent a tiny minority of estate tax payers. The reason, he said, is as much philosophical as practical. An estate tax effectively and unfairly taxes a person\u2019s earnings twice, he argued: first when they earn it and again when they die. And, he added, it penalizes savers without touching spenders. \u201cI think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing,\u201d Grassley said, \u201cas opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it\u2019s on booze or women or movies.\u201d \n \n If Grassley wants to stop boozers and womanizers, he\u2019d have his hands full just focusing on his Capitol Hill colleagues. Nothing says \u201cI\u2019m a man of the people\u201d like attempting to craft laws to punish people for their social activities, amirite? \n \n This is everything right and wrong with the current Republican tax-reform effort in a nutshell. His first argument on the estate tax is dead-on correct. The estate tax\u2019s true offense to ordered liberty is that it double-dips. Accumulated wealth exists from earnings already subject to taxation, and further taxation by passing the estate to one\u2019s heirs is an injustice that in some cases needlessly complicates an already emotional process. It\u2019s a form of double jeopardy, at least in principle. \n \n In the very next breath, however, Grassley commits the same sin that has plagued the tax system for decades, which is Congress\u2019 desire to commit social engineering through it. The point of limited taxation is that the money belongs to the people who earned it, not the government elected by those people. If I want to spend my money on dinner with a woman, the latest Roman-numeral cookie-cutter superhero flick, followed up by a few drinks at the local bar, that\u2019s my business and not that of Chuck Grassley. (In my case specifically, it would also be my wife\u2019s business, and I\u2019d face a very different kind of taxation.) Those choices should neither be abetted nor punished through the federal tax system. \n \n Conservatives have argued for decades to eliminate the kind of social engineering Grassley endorses here. A decade ago, we had competing tax proposals for either a flat tax or a repeal of the 16th Amendment and the use of a consumption tax to replace the current income tax. Now that Republicans finally have control of Washington, the best that they can do is merely an adjustment to the existing labyrinthine system \u2014 especially true of the Senate version \u2014 that leaves in place all of the manipulative capabilities for social engineering in both the corporate and individual tax systems. \n \n Finally, while eliminating the estate tax is a theoretically principled step, it should have been waaaaaaay down the list for true reform. As the DMR points out, it doesn\u2019t actually impact very many taxpayers anyway, thanks to a high threshold for its application (currently $5 million in estate assets for single heirs, $11 million for married). In Iowa, that would impact perhaps 10% of all farms before allowable deductions that would raise the threshold even higher. And the Senate bill doesn\u2019t even repeal the tax \u2014 it only raises the thresholds to $11 million/$22 million. That also is an adjustment, not a reform, so Grassley can\u2019t even stand on the principle he proposes. \n \n Republicans had an opportunity to be bold; instead, they\u2019re perpetuating the problem. In honor of that, I think I\u2019ll get a case of Jameson\u2019s, a shelf of new Blu-Ray films, and celebrate the victory of the swamp until the 2018 elections. As for the womanizing, Grassley has no worries. My wife is all over that one.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley is taking flak over comments he made about why the GOP aims to scrap or least mitigate the estate tax. In speaking to the Des Moines Register, Grassley said the tax often derided by Republicans as the \"death tax\" is unfair because it taxes earnings twice, first when people earn the money and again when they die and try to pass it on to their heirs. Then came the more controversial part: \"I think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing, as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it\u2019s on booze or women or movies.\" As NPR notes, that triggered a flurry of online criticism from those who viewed Grassley's remarks as elitist. This tweet is typical of the reaction: \"I'm sure those folks would love to invest, but they're a bit preoccupied just trying to make ends meet.\" The Washington Post notes that it also caught the attention of former Hillary Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson, who tweeted, \"[I]f we gave that money in middle class tax cuts, they\u2019d just waste it on hookers and blow. right?\u201d But it wasn't just Democrats taking issue. At the conservative Hot Air site, Ed Morrissey says the comment \"is everything right and wrong with the current Republican tax-reform effort in a nutshell.\" Grassley's first criticism of the \"double dip\" problem with the estate tax is spot-on correct, he writes. \"In the very next breath, however, Grassley commits the same sin that has plagued the tax system for decades, which is Congress\u2019 desire to commit social engineering through it.\" The House tax plan would eliminate the tax entirely in 2024, while the Senate version would double exemptions to $11 million for individuals and $22 million for couples.",

The middle class is getting a big break!\" He continued: \"It still has a negative effect on the economy. Many don't end up paying the tax, but it will cut taxes for 98% of American working people.\" Trump's tweet was in response to criticism of the tax plan from Republicans and Democrats alike.

Chuck Grassley to the Des Moines Register in response to a question about the GOP tax bill. The estate tax is one of the most talked about parts of the tax bill, and Iowa's Republican delegation has made it a point to argue that it unfairly lumps farmers with the country's richest families. But a review of federal tax data and nonpartisan research on the subject shows that family farmers and \u2013 President Trump's plan to reform the tax code has farmers and their supporters railing against the estate tax, which is one of the main reasons Republicans want to do away with it. Here's a look at why that's not the case: USA Today reports that of the 5,219 estate tax returns filed by farmers and other Americans in 2016, only 682 actually owned any farm assets. That's about 13% of all estate tax payers in the country. The Congressional Research Service says just 65 farm estates in the US face an estate tax liability each year, and less than a quarter of them have enough cash to pay \u2013 The GOP's plan to reform the tax code is expected to pass the House and Senate this week, and Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley is on board. The Republican senator, who co-sponsored a bill to abolish the estate tax earlier this year, tells the Des Moines Register that he's in favor of doubling the tax exemption to $5.5 million for individuals and $1 million for married couples. He says the latter would simplify financial planning for farmers, who often have to file multiple estate tax returns. The estate tax, which generates tens of billions of dollars a year, was included in the House tax bill but not the Senate bill \u2013 A provision in the Senate tax bill that would double the estate tax exemption to $5.5 million for individuals and $11 million for couples isn't sitting well with some Iowa farmers. Sen. Chuck Grassley tells the Des Moines Register that farmers are \"forced into spending large sums of their hard-earned dollars on lawyers and accountants to avoid its impact instead of reinvesting in their business.\" The estate tax is \"a major headache for farmers and business owners,\" he says. \"So the one thing I would say about the proposals on the table is they would definitely reduce the need for the vast majority of our farmers to worry about it at all \u2013 \"I think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing, as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it's on booze or women or movies,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley tells the Des Moines Register. The estate tax is a favorite target of Republicans, who say it hurts families trying to pass their farms on to the next generation. But a review of federal tax data and nonpartisan research on the subject shows that \"family farmers and small business owners represent a tiny share of estate tax payers, and that the taxes they owe rarely force them to sell land or quit farming,\" the Register \u2013 Sen. Charles Grassley is taking a lot of flak for comments he made to the Des Moines Register over the weekend about the estate tax. The Republican senator, who is responsible for writing the GOP's tax plan, said he thinks people who don't invest their money \"are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it's on booze or women or movies.\" Critics immediately pounced. \"Darn straight, Sen. Grassley,\" tweeted former Hillary Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson, per the Washington Post. \"If we gave that money in middle class tax cuts, they'd just waste it on hookers and blow.\" \u2013 Sen. Chuck Grassley has caused a stir with his suggestion that people who don't invest or sock away money in the bank should throw it away. In an interview with the Des Moines Register, the Iowa Republican was asked about the estate tax, which he has long argued is bad for farmers because it makes it difficult for farmers to pass their businesses on to the next generation. \"I think it\u2019s very unfair,\" he said. \"If you\u2019re a family farmer, you have to break up your operations to pay the IRS following the death of a loved one as it is for parents saving for their children\u2019s \u2013 Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad isn't happy about President Trump's plan to cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 15%. \"I am opposed to any reduction in the tax rate,\" he said in a statement, per the Des Moines Register. \"The tax rate is already too high, and it will only get higher.\" The governor, who is up for re-election next year, says the plan, which also reduces the personal income tax rate and reduces the number of tax brackets from seven to four, will hurt Iowa's economy by forcing businesses to \"spend large sums of their hard-earned dollars on \u2013 President Trump took to Twitter Thursday morning to make the case that the GOP's tax plan is good for the economy. \"The big tax cut for the wealthy and corporations is a big part of our tax plan,\" he tweeted. \"Also for working people and small businesses it is a tax cut. The middle class is getting a big break!\" He went on to say that \"many don't end up paying the tax,\" but that \"it still has a negative effect on the economy.\" In a follow-up tweet, he added that the tax plan \"will cut taxes for 98% of American working people\" and \" \u2013 The GOP's hopes of passing tax reform before the end of the year took a hit over the weekend when Sen. Chuck Grassley, the influential chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he wouldn't support a repeal of the estate tax unless it was accompanied by a corresponding increase in the capital gains tax, the New York Times reports. The estate tax \"doubles\" when a person's earnings are taxed at both the time of death and again when they die, Grassley said in comments to the Des Moines Register. \"I think not having theestate tax recognizes the people that are investing, as opposed to those that",

One official read quotations to The Times, and a second official confirmed the broad outlines of the discussion. \n \n Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, did not dispute the account. \n \n In a statement, he said that Mr. Comey had behaved politically and put unnecessary pressure on the president\u2019s ability to conduct diplomacy with Russia on matters such as Syria, Ukraine and the Islamic State. \n \n \u201cBy grandstanding and politicizing the investigation into Russia\u2019s actions, James Comey created unnecessary pressure on our ability to engage and negotiate with Russia,\u201d Mr. Spicer said. \u201cThe investigation would have always continued, and obviously, the termination of Comey would not have ended it. Once again, the real story is that our national security has been undermined by the leaking of private and highly classified conversations.\u201d \n \n The day after firing Mr. Comey, Mr. Trump hosted Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, in the Oval Office, along with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak. The meeting ignited controversy this week when it was revealed that Mr. Trump had disclosed intelligence from an Israeli counterterrorism operation. \n \n A third government official briefed on the meeting defended the president, saying that Mr. Trump, whose discursive speaking style has hindered him in office, was using a negotiating tactic when he told Mr. Lavrov about the \u201cpressure\u201d he was under. The idea, the official suggested, was to create a sense of obligation with Russian officials and to coax concessions out of Mr. Lavrov \u2014 on Syria, Ukraine and other issues \u2014 by saying that Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election had created enormous political problems for Mr. Trump. ||||| The law enforcement investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign has identified a current White House official as a significant person of interest, showing that the probe is reaching into the highest levels of government, according to people familiar with the matter. \n \n The senior White House adviser under scrutiny by investigators is someone close to the president, according to these people, who would not further identify the official. \n \n The revelation comes as the investigation appears to be entering a more overtly active phase, with investigators shifting from work that has remained largely hidden from the public to conducting interviews and using a grand jury to issue subpoenas. The intensity of the probe is expected to accelerate in the coming weeks, the people said. \n \n The sources emphasized that investigators remain keenly interested in people who previously wielded influence in the Trump campaign and administration but are no longer part of it, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort. \n \n Flynn resigned in February after disclosures that he had lied to administration officials about his contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Current administration officials who have acknowledged contacts with Russian officials include President Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \n \n (Peter Stevenson,Jason Aldag,Whitney Leaming/The Washington Post) \n \n [Graphic: What we know so far about Team Trump\u2019s ties to Russian interests] \n \n People familiar with the investigation said the intensifying effort does not mean criminal charges are near, or that any such charges will result. Earlier this week, Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Robert S. Mueller III to serve as special counsel and lead the investigation into Russian meddling. \n \n It is unclear exactly how Mueller\u2019s leadership will affect the direction of the probe, and he is already bringing in new people to work on the team. Those familiar with the case said its significance had increased before Mueller\u2019s appointment. \n \n Although the case began quietly last July as an effort to determine whether any Trump associates coordinated with Russian operatives to meddle in the presidential election campaign, the investigative work now being done by the FBI also includes determining whether any financial crimes were committed by people close to the president. The people familiar with the matter said the probe has sharpened into something more fraught for the White House, the FBI and the Justice Department \u2014 particularly because of the public steps investigators know they now need to take, the people said. \n \n When subpoenas are issued or interviews are requested, it is possible the people being asked to talk or provide documents will reveal publicly what they were asked about. \n \n A small group of lawmakers known as the Gang of Eight was notified of the change in tempo and focus in the investigation at a classified briefing Wednesday evening, the people familiar with the matter said. Then-FBI Director James B. Comey publicly confirmed the existence of the investigation in March. \n \n Justice Department spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said, \u201cI can\u2019t confirm or deny the existence or nonexistence of investigations or targets of investigations.\u201d An FBI spokesman declined to comment. \n \n White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, \u201cAs the president has stated before, a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity.\u2019\u2019 \n \n While there has been a loud public debate in recent days over the question of whether the president might have attempted to obstruct justice in his private dealings with Comey, whom Trump fired last week, people familiar with the matter said investigators on the case are more focused on Russian influence operations and possible financial crimes. \n \n The FBI\u2019s investigation seeks to determine whether and to what extent Trump associates were in contact with Kremlin operatives, what business dealings they might have had in Russia, and whether they in any way facilitated the hacking and publishing of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta, during the presidential campaign. Several congressional committees are also investigating, though their probes could not produce criminal charges. \n \n [Appointment of Mueller could complicate other probes into alleged Russian meddling] \n \n A grand jury in Alexandria, Va., recently issued a subpoena for records related to Flynn\u2019s business, the Flynn Intel Group, which was paid more than $500,000 by a company owned by a Turkish American businessman close to top Turkish officials, according to people familiar with the matter. \n \n The Flynn Intel Group was paid for research on Fethullah Gulen, a cleric who Turkey\u2019s current president believes was responsible for a coup attempt last summer. Flynn retroactively registered with the Justice Department in March as a paid foreign agent for Turkish interests. \n \n Separately from the probe now run by Mueller, Flynn is being investigated by the Pentagon\u2019s top watchdog for his foreign payments. Flynn also received $45,000 to appear in 2015 with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a dinner for RT, a Kremlin-controlled media organization. \n \n Flynn discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States during the month before Trump took office, and he withheld that fact from the vice president. That prompted then-acting attorney general Sally Yates to warn the White House\u2019s top lawyer that Flynn might be susceptible to blackmail. Flynn stepped down after The Washington Post reported on the contents of the call. \n \n The president has nonetheless seemed to defend his former adviser. A memo by Comey alleged that Trump asked that the probe into Flynn be shut down. \n \n [Notes made by FBI Director Comey say Trump pressured him to end Flynn probe] \n \n The White House also has acknowledged that Kushner met with Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States, in late November. Kushner also has acknowledged that he met with the head of a Russian development bank, Vnesheconombank, which has been under U.S. sanctions since July 2014. The president\u2019s son-in-law initially omitted contacts with foreign leaders from a national security questionnaire, though his lawyer has said publicly he submitted the form prematurely and informed the FBI soon after that he would provide an update. \n \n Vnesheconombank handles development for the state, and in early 2015, a man purporting to be one of its New York-based employees was arrested and accused of being an unregistered spy. \n \n That man \u2014 Evgeny Buryakov \u2014 ultimately pleaded guilty and was eventually deported. He had been in contact with former Trump adviser Carter Page, though Page has said he shared only \u201cbasic immaterial information and publicly available research documents\u201d with the Russian. Page was the subject of a secret warrant last year issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, based on suspicions he might have been acting as an agent of the Russian government, according to people familiar with the matter. Page has denied any wrongdoing, and accused the government of violating his civil rights. \n \n Ellen Nakashima and Ashley Parker contributed to this report. \n \n Read more: \n \n What\u2019s next in the Russia investigation?

According to a White House document seen by the Times, Trump told Sergey Lavrov that the firing of the FBI chief had put too much pressure on him. \"James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press,\" the president was quoted as saying. The document is based on notes taken from inside the Oval Office and has been circulated as the official account of the meeting. A White House official tells the Times that Trump was using a negotiating tactic when he told Lavrov the \"pressure\" he was under. The official says Trump was trying to get Lavrov to say that Russian meddling in the election had created huge political problems for the president. The Washington Post has the full text of the president's comments. \u2013 A \"significant person of interest\" in the Russia investigation is a senior White House adviser who is someone close to President Trump, sources tell the Washington Post. The sources say the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign is now entering a more active phase, with investigators shifting from work that has remained largely hidden from the public to conducting interviews and using a grand jury to issue subpoenas. The intensity of the probe is expected to accelerate in the coming weeks. Current and former administration officials who have acknowledged contact with Russian officials include Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. \u2013 The FBI investigation into possible ties between Russia and members of President Trump's campaign has shifted focus, with investigators now looking into possible financial crimes committed by people close to the president, sources tell the Washington Post. The investigation, which the sources say began last July and was confirmed by then-FBI Director James Comey in March, has been given the green light by special counsel Robert Mueller, who has been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the election, the New York Times reports. The investigators are looking into whether Trump associates were in contact with Russian operatives and whether any hacking and publishing of emails occurred. The sources say investigators have notified a small group of lawmakers, known as the Gang of Eight, that the investigation is no longer focusing on possible collusion between Trump associates and Russia and is now looking for evidence of financial crimes. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said, \"As the president has stated before, a thorough investigation will confirm that there was no collusion between the campaign and any foreign entity.\"",

    "document": "If journalists played it straight with movie stars, they\u2019d call it an interrogation not an interview. It\u2019d be conducted at a police station\u2014some grimy, windowless room at the back, cramped and full of the hot stink of fear and funk. After bouncing the star off a wall or two, ignoring the pitiful pleas for a phone call, a lawyer, a mommy, the journalist would shine a light in those pretty, pretty eyes, and start grilling. What did you have to do to get your big break? How long do you think you can turn the trick, keep the public interested, huh? Who are you sleeping with? Who are you sleeping with? Who are you sleeping with? O.K., maybe I\u2019m overstating the case. I\u2019m not, however, mis-stating it. Encounters between movie stars and the journalists who cover them are edgy, deeply. They are, by their very nature, transactional: the journalist offers the star, usually with a new project or venture to promote, exposure; the star offers the journalist revelation, a couple of juicy details with which to titillate readers. Use and be used, give and take, a mutual hustle and the way of the world. Couldn\u2019t be clearer, right? Where things get murky is in the trappings. The interview is made to look like the opposite of what it is: a friendly social interaction. The star and I always meet at a restaurant\u2014the garden terrace at the Chateau Marmont or the Clement at the Peninsula\u2014almost always for lunch. There\u2019s conversation (one-sided, but still) and an attentive waiter and imported mineral water and a salad of wild arugula, locally grown, and it\u2019s easy to forget that our interests are at odds and that the relationship is, at heart, antagonistic. Only I couldn\u2019t forget with Kate McKinnon, the Emmy-winning Saturday Night Live mainstay (S.N.L. is the venture she\u2019s currently promoting, Season 43, set to premiere on September 30), perhaps the most gifted of a gifted generation of young comics, her flair for mimicry and slapstick allowing her to create characters and impressions that are both spookily exact and totally off the wall. Mind you, I\u2019m not proposing that Kate herself is antagonistic. She isn\u2019t. In fact, her niceness is as pronounced, extreme, and undeniable as her talent\u2014it\u2019s the quality of hers you\u2019re struck by first. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz; Styled by Jessica Diehl. But I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Cat Class, Cat Style \n \n Let me set the scene: it\u2019s a Friday afternoon, hot, every face, every object, with that sweaty, New-York-in-the-summer shine to it. Kate and I are meeting for lunch, naturally, and she\u2019s suggested a place in the East Village. I can\u2019t say the name because I promised Kate I wouldn\u2019t. (It\u2019s a best-kept secret, only it wouldn\u2019t be if I blabbed, is the idea.) Technically it\u2019s a restaurant, though \u201crestaurant\u201d seems like too highfalutin a term to convey its essence. \u201cHole-in-the-wall\u201d might be nearer the mark, \u201cdump\u201d nearer still: linoleum floor, laminated menus, Asian-y pop music on the speakers (\u201cAsian-y\u201d is as close as I\u2019ll get to giving away its identity\u2014see, Kate, I didn\u2019t break my word), ceiling fan moving the thick, soupy air around some without cooling it any. Yet the food is as good as the ambience is bad, as I will soon discover when a guy, a waiter I assume though he\u2019s in street clothes, flings on the table first Kate\u2019s dish and then, following a discreet dick adjustment, mine. Kate arrives on time to the minute. I\u2019m early, so I have a chance to observe her as she enters. She\u2019s dressed down. Movie stars are typically dressed down for these occasions. (Another reason they\u2019re deceptive: people come costumed as though it\u2019s playtime, not work.) But Kate isn\u2019t dressed movie-star down, i.e., the kind of down that\u2019s flattering to the figure and still involves the application of a not inconsiderable amount of makeup, i.e., a stylist-approved, camera-ready kind of down. Kate\u2019s dressed real-person down, i.e., badly: oversize T-shirt and pants that aren\u2019t quite sweat but close enough; sneakered feet; face cosmetics-free; hair in a ponytail, or, rather, what would be a ponytail if she hadn\u2019t failed to tug the hair all the way through the elastic, leaving it in a sort of ponytail-bun limbo. As quickly as I\u2019m struck by how un-vain she is, I\u2019m struck by how much she has to be vain about. She\u2019s very pretty: small-bodied and full-lipped with cat eyes\u2014pale blue and almond-shaped and slanting\u2014tawny skin and hair, dimples she can twitch into existence without even smiling. She\u2019s 33 but appears younger, a few years out of college. I\u2019d watched hours of footage of her in preparation for this encounter yet had somehow missed her great good looks. Not that she photographs poorly. It\u2019s just that in most scenes she\u2019s impersonating a woman far, far older than she (Debette Goldry, legend of the silver screen, a fictional creation) or a woman far older (the all-too-real Betsy DeVos) or a man (Robert Durst) or a boy-man (Justin Bieber). And her face is rarely in repose. She\u2019s often stretching it in some crazy, rubbery way, thrusting out her jaw, baring her teeth. And it isn\u2019t only Kate\u2019s eyes that are feline; it\u2019s her manner as well. I don\u2019t mean to suggest that she\u2019s aloof or self-regarding in that cat style. Quite the contrary, in fact. As we sit down, she asks me questions and, after it\u2019s revealed that I have two small boys, requests a picture, and actually looks when I produce it. But she has a cat\u2019s sensitivity and suspiciousness, is nerved up as a cat is nerved up. It\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s equipped with a pair of invisible whiskers, and the moment those whiskers come into contact with something wrong\u2014the tape recorder I slide onto the table, for example, the felt-tip pen I uncap and place at a diagonal on a stenographer\u2019s notebook\u2014she starts to back away on soft, padded paws. And it\u2019s immediately apparent to me that I\u2019m going to have to approach her slowly, carefully, no false moves, and that even the slowest, most careful and false-move-free approach might not work. She could still get spooked, run off. And as I\u2019m having this thought, and as my stomach is twisting in response to it, another one occurs to me: how newly famous she is. Or not newly famous, exactly. She became a featured player on S.N.L. in 2012, a full cast member in 2013, and was an audience favorite straightaway. But newly super-famous. The reason, Donald Trump. Kate is, of course, the show\u2019s Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s once and future nemesis, though the loathing between Kate\u2019s Hillary and Alec Baldwin\u2019s Trump is so intense, instinctive, and visceral it\u2019s almost arousing, it\u2019s almost love\u2014you just know the two never stop thinking about each other. She\u2019s his hate interest. (Question: Were we too freaked out and pissed off to notice that the 2016 presidential election was the greatest battle-of-the-sexes screwball farce of the modern era, the blackest romantic comedy of them all? That Clinton and Trump were a surreal, gonzo version of Hepburn and Tracy? Hepburn and Tracy as re-interpreted by David Lynch or Quentin Tarantino? Trump\u2019s nearing the end of his first year as our El N\u00famero Uno Commander in Chief and he still can\u2019t shut up about the woman he defeated back in November, gets this wistful look in his eye whenever he calls her by her pet name, Crooked Hillary. It\u2019s as if the old Rodgers and Hart tune were running in his head on a loop. The sleepless nights / The daily fights . . . I wish I were in love again.) Photograph by Annie Leibovitz; Styled by Jessica Diehl. Hillary \n \n Kate is not S.N.L.\u2019s only Hillary. Jan Hooks took the initial shot, memorably playing the then First Lady as a simmering cauldron of barely suppressed resentment (\u201cI happen to be the co-president of the United States\u201d). There was also Amy Poehler\u2019s Hillary: Obama\u2019s rival, a brittle, chilly bluestocking whose will to power had been thwarted one too many times and whose smile had become so wooden you could rap your knuckles on it for luck. Kate\u2019s Hillary, however, blows them all away. Kate\u2019s Hillary has her hard-driving bitch side to be sure, but mostly she\u2019s the world\u2019s worst combination\u2014half schoolmarm, half princess\u2014who knows she\u2019s the world\u2019s worst combination, keenly feels her lack of flash and charisma, of the common touch, the qualities possessed in such abundance by her mate and Obama, even by Trump, yet is steady and decent and true, and wants to do good\u2014oh, how she wants to do good!\u2014though is stymied in her attempts because regular folk plain don\u2019t cotton to her, are looking for any excuse to go in another direction. There\u2019s pathos in Kate\u2019s Hillary. You laugh at her, but you feel for her, too. And the sketch that Kate and Hillary did together, Kate as Hillary, Hillary as a seen-it-all barkeep named Val, was, I thought, Hillary\u2019s best moment of the entire election, certainly her warmest. As Val she was relaxed, loose, funny, natural\u2014everything she wasn\u2019t and perhaps couldn\u2019t be on the campaign trail. Last season\u2019s co-head writer Chris Kelly: \u201cThe real Hillary was very game. We showed her the script, and we assumed that she, or any presidential candidate, would have notes or try to be open but still secretly have a bunch of things they didn\u2019t want to make fun of. She read it and laughed and was like, \u2018O.K.\u2019 \u201d Says Kate, \u201cHillary has great timing.\u201d Kate actually says very little else about Hillary, not because she has little else to say but because she gets too overwhelmed to say it. She tears up when she recalls tearing up when she viewed the presidential debates with Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider, another co-head writer from last season, in preparation for devising those weeks\u2019 cold opens. Schneider: \u201cKate and Chris and I would meet at the 30 Rock offices or we\u2019d pick one of our apartments. I watched as a writer of a satire comedy show, and so I saw everything through the lens of, Can I make fun of that? But I also watched as a woman and I was concerned. I saw some of the attitudes taken towards Hillary\u2014the nasty-woman comment. And I can understand why Kate would get emotional about that.\u201d Though Kate\u2019s Hillary is, obviously, not Hillary Hillary, there is a kind of fusion going on between impersonator and the human being whose skin, soul, and mind the impersonator is inhabiting. To do her job as well as she does, empathy is essential, which means she must stay open and raw where the rest of us\u2014we nonperformers\u2014are hard and self-protective. Psychologically it\u2019s a dangerous place to be. Kate: \u201cI love doing impressions of politicians because the task is always to imagine the private lives of these people whose job it is to project an image of staunch, unflinching leadership and grace, and that\u2019s just not how human beings, in their heart of hearts, work. In doing that for Hillary Clinton, who I admire so much, I started to feel very close to her, just trying to imagine her inner life.\u201d She necessarily takes it personally. Hillary, et al. \n \n Let\u2019s talk now about Kate\u2019s other impressions. (An F.Y.I.: Kate\u2019s speaking voice is soft, very. The only times I don\u2019t have to lean in to catch it are when she\u2019s doing an impression, at which point self-consciousness disappears because she is no longer herself and thus unthinkingly turns up the volume, and when she\u2019s telling me something she regards as important, and to both make me laugh and to make sure I don\u2019t fuck it up, she yells the words directly into my recorder\u2019s ear. To me, sotto voce, \u201cMy most frequent collaborators at S.N.L. are the incredibly gifted writers,\u201d and then to my recorder, in stereophonic sound, \u201cCHRIS KELLY AND SARAH SCHNEIDER!\u201d) A touchstone for Kate is Molly Shannon\u2019s Mary Katherine Gallagher, the Catholic schoolgirl who\u2019s rough on d\u00e9cor and who sniffs her armpit-dipped fingers when she\u2019s nervous: \u201cMary Katherine is crashing into tables and doing a little dance, and yet she\u2019s so real at the same time. You have to love her so much because she\u2019s a person who\u2019s trying to connect, but is thwarted by everything about who she is. I can relate to that.\u201d It\u2019s the generosity of spirit Shannon brought to the character that Kate responded to, and she brings that same spirit to whomever she\u2019s representing. Says Lorne Michaels, \u201cKate can embody a character and bring it to life and make it funny. But there\u2019s also always something empathetic about her characters. And although the writing might not be kind, she is. That\u2019s her genius. You can\u2019t make the audience fall in love with a character you don\u2019t like.\u201d Kate has begun appearing in big roles in major feature films, most notably in last year\u2019s all-female Ghostbusters reboot, which if it did nothing else served to remind us how weird people can still be about women (the outrage on social media that Columbia Pictures had the gall to remake this towering achievement of cinematic expression with cootie-ridden girls\u2014e-e-e-e-e-u-u-u-u-w!\u2014was as amusing as it was depressing), and this year\u2019s bachelorette-party-gone-bad comedy Rough Night. Kate shines in both, but the movies feel slightly beside the point. Maybe because what she\u2019s doing on S.N.L. feels so essential. There\u2019s the pure political theater of her Hillary, of course. Yet there\u2019s also her Elizabeth Warren, her Kellyanne Conway, her Jeff Sessions. Season 42 of S.N.L. had more eyeballs fastened on it than any season since Season 19 (1993-94), and received more Emmy nominations than any season ever, including for Kate and Baldwin, both of whom would win. Election years can often mean a ratings bounce for the show, only this time that bounce went sky-high and didn\u2019t come back to earth, even after the contest was decided. On Hillary Clinton: \u201cI admire [her] so much, I started to feel very close to her, just trying to imagine her inner life.\u201d Somehow S.N.L. has managed to locate the center of a culture that\u2019s without one, that\u2019s increasingly fractured. Over the last 18 months or so, politics has become the national obsession, what\u2019s pushing us together as a country even as it\u2019s driving us apart. And to end each week with S.N.L., releasing the pent-up anger and frustration and fear and anxiety with laughter, is cathartic. This, too: the eerily symbiotic relationship that has developed between S.N.L. and the White House. S.N.L. watches the White House in order to satirize it; the White House watches the satirization and then offers notes. Trump tweeted after the October 15, 2016, episode, \u201cAlec Baldwin portrayal stinks.\u201d And yet Trump seems beyond influenced by it, seems haunted. Am I nuts or has Trump, since Baldwin debuted his Trump, squinted harder, pooched out his bottom lip farther? (Observes Baldwin, \u201cHe makes this face like he\u2019s snarling and about to leap at you, like he\u2019s in a production of Cats.\u201d) And though purists will argue that Anthony Atamanuik\u2019s Trump or John Di Domenico\u2019s are the more nuanced and artful, it\u2019s Baldwin\u2019s that\u2019s captured the public imagination. Scrambled the imagination, as well. In February, El Nacional, a newspaper in the Dominican Republic, printed a photograph of Baldwin as Trump believing it was Trump. Says Baldwin, \u201cMy thought was that if I did a good impression of Trump it would be dull. So I ran towards this idea that I\u2019m going to do a horrific caricature. When you\u2019re doing an impression, you can suggest the voice, or the way the guy looks, but you\u2019ve really got to think of who he is, and get that right, and I think I did. In terms of the media, I\u2019m Trump now. He\u2019s not even Trump anymore\u2014I am.\u201d Baldwin has considered running for office in the future. I want to propose the ultimate comedic reversal of fortune: Trump, driven so crazy by Baldwin\u2019s Trump, forfeits the presidency to escape it (other contributing factors include the Russia thing, the special-counsel thing, the wee-wee tape thing); Baldwin, having played POTUS on TV, is elected to play POTUS in life, Kate\u2019s Hillary his V.P.; Trump, a two-time S.N.L. host, is recruited by that shrewd barnstormer Lorne Michaels to become the show\u2019s Baldwin. We\u2019re in a world now where such a scenario is, if not plausible, possible. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz; Styled by Jessica Diehl. For Public Consumption \n \n Kate and I start with her professional life, and we stay there for a long time, and we\u2019re doing all right, are cooking with gas, in fact, even if we do encounter the occasional bump in the road. For instance, when I ask her about a dinner she had with Hillary at Orso in late winter (Peter Biskind, a Vanity Fair contributing editor, just happened to be at the restaurant that night: \u201cMost of the diners stood up and there was gaping and scattered applause. And there were lots of what I assume were Secret Service men and they followed Hillary when she went downstairs to the john\u201d), her eyes begin to skitter and jump. I immediately cast around for a less sensitive topic, though I hadn\u2019t realized that one was sensitive. And we continue to do O.K. when I jolt the conversation onto another track, inquire about her family and early career. She grew up on Long Island, Mom a social worker, Dad an architect. Kate was, to her parents\u2019 delight, an arty kid, and a natural cutup. Mel Brooks was a household god. \u201cWe watched The Producers once a week.\u201d So was Christopher Guest. (Kate is, with the exception of Kristen Wiig, the biggest female star to come out of S.N.L. since Tina Fey, and the comparisons between her and her predecessor are both legion and inevitable. They are also, in my opinion, inaccurate. Fey, a former S.N.L. head writer, is brilliant, incisive, withheld, in charge; whether or not she\u2019s technically running the show, she\u2019s running the show; and she\u2019s always Tina Fey, even when she\u2019s, say, Sarah Palin. Kate, though equally brilliant, is brilliant in an entirely different way. She\u2019s a softer, sweeter comic presence, and more anarchic, open to a manic impulse or the zigzagging energy coming off the performers around her, and she disappears into the identity she\u2019s assuming at that moment. And it\u2019s Guest repertory player Catherine O\u2019Hara, she of the elastic face and bugaboo stare and oddball characters who believe they\u2019re perfectly normal, to whom Kate bears the strongest resemblance.) Kate attended Columbia University, where she was part of the Varsity Show, a satirical look at campus life, and whose alumni, incidentally, include Rodgers and Hart. Senior year she went on an audition for a sketch series on Logo and got the job, which gave her the misimpression that breaking into showbiz was easy. \u201cI learned quickly that that was a major fluke and then didn\u2019t get paid again for a long time.\u201d Eventually she landed at the Upright Citizens Brigade, and from there it was on to S.N.L.

Quite the contrary, in fact. As we sit down, she asks me questions and, after it\u2019s revealed that I have two small boys, requests a picture, and actually looks when I produce it. But she has a cat\u2019s sensitivity and suspiciousness, is nerved up as a cat is nerved up. It\u2019s almost as if she\u2019s equipped with a pair of invisible whiskers, and the moment those whiskers come into contact with something wrong\u2014the tape recorder I slide onto the table, for example, the felt-tip pen I uncap and place at a diagonal on a stenographer\u2019s notebook\u2014she starts to back away on soft, padded paws. And it\u2019s immediately apparent to me that I\u2019m going to have to approach her slowly, carefully, no false moves, and that even the slowest, most careful and false-move-free approach might not work. She could still get spooked, run off. And as I\u2019m having this thought, and as my stomach is twisting in response to it, another one occurs to me: how newly famous she is. Or not newly famous, exactly. She became a featured player on S.N.L. in 2012, a full cast member in 2013, and was an audience favorite straightaway. But newly super-famous. The reason, Donald Trump. Kate is, of course, the show\u2019s Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s once and future nemesis, though the loathing between Kate\u2019s Hillary and Alec Baldwin\u2019s Trump is so intense, instinctive, and visceral it\u2019s almost arousing, it\u2019s almost love\u2014you just know the two never stop thinking about each other. She\u2019s his hate interest. (Question: Were we too freaked out and pissed off to notice that the 2016 presidential election was the greatest battle-of-the-sexes screwball farce of the modern era, the blackest romantic comedy of them all? That Clinton and Trump were a surreal, gonzo version of Hepburn and Tracy? Hepburn and Tracy as re-interpreted by David Lynch or Quentin Tarantino? Trump\u2019s nearing the end of his first year as our El N\u00famero Uno Commander in Chief and he still can\u2019t shut up about the woman he defeated back in November, gets this wistful look in his eye whenever he calls her by her pet name, Crooked Hillary. It\u2019s as if the old Rodgers and Hart tune were running in his head on a loop. The sleepless nights / The daily fights . . . I wish I were in love again.) Photograph by Annie Leibovitz; Styled by Jessica Diehl. Hillary \n \n Kate is not S.N.L.\u2019s only Hillary. Jan Hooks took the initial shot, memorably playing the then First Lady as a simmering cauldron of barely suppressed resentment (\u201cI happen to be the co-president of the United States\u201d). There was also Amy Poehler\u2019s Hillary: Obama\u2019s rival, a brittle, chilly bluestocking whose will to power had been thwarted one too many times and whose smile had become so wooden you could rap your knuckles on it for luck. Kate\u2019s Hillary, however, blows them all away. Kate\u2019s Hillary has her hard-driving bitch side to be sure, but mostly she\u2019s the world\u2019s worst combination\u2014half schoolmarm, half princess\u2014who knows she\u2019s the world\u2019s worst combination, keenly feels her lack of flash and charisma, of the common touch, the qualities possessed in such abundance by her mate and Obama, even by Trump, yet is steady and decent and true, and wants to do good\u2014oh, how she wants to do good!\u2014though is stymied in her attempts because regular folk plain don\u2019t cotton to her, are looking for any excuse to go in another direction. There\u2019s pathos in Kate\u2019s Hillary. You laugh at her, but you feel for her, too. And the sketch that Kate and Hillary did together, Kate as Hillary, Hillary as a seen-it-all barkeep named Val, was, I thought, Hillary\u2019s best moment of the entire election, certainly her warmest. As Val she was relaxed, loose, funny, natural\u2014everything she wasn\u2019t and perhaps couldn\u2019t be on the campaign trail. Last season\u2019s co-head writer Chris Kelly: \u201cThe real Hillary was very game. We showed her the script, and we assumed that she, or any presidential candidate, would have notes or try to be open but still secretly have a bunch of things they didn\u2019t want to make fun of. She read it and laughed and was like, \u2018O.K.\u2019 \u201d Says Kate, \u201cHillary has great timing.\u201d Kate actually says very little else about Hillary, not because she has little else to say but because she gets too overwhelmed to say it. She tears up when she recalls tearing up when she viewed the presidential debates with Chris Kelly and Sarah Schneider, another co-head writer from last season, in preparation for devising those weeks\u2019 cold opens. Schneider: \u201cKate and Chris and I would meet at the 30 Rock offices or we\u2019d pick one of our apartments. I watched as a writer of a satire comedy show, and so I saw everything through the lens of, Can I make fun of that? But I also watched as a woman and I was concerned. I saw some of the attitudes taken towards Hillary\u2014the nasty-woman comment. And I can understand why Kate would get emotional about that.\u201d Though Kate\u2019s Hillary is, obviously, not Hillary Hillary, there is a kind of fusion going on between impersonator and the human being whose skin, soul, and mind the impersonator is inhabiting. To do her job as well as she does, empathy is essential, which means she must stay open and raw where the rest of us\u2014we nonperformers\u2014are hard and self-protective. Psychologically it\u2019s a dangerous place to be. Kate: \u201cI love doing impressions of politicians because the task is always to imagine the private lives of these people whose job it is to project an image of staunch, unflinching leadership and grace, and that\u2019s just not how human beings, in their heart of hearts, work. In doing that for Hillary Clinton, who I admire so much, I started to feel very close to her, just trying to imagine her inner life.\u201d She necessarily takes it personally. Hillary, et al. \n \n Let\u2019s talk now about Kate\u2019s other impressions. (An F.Y.I.: Kate\u2019s speaking voice is soft, very. The only times I don\u2019t have to lean in to catch it are when she\u2019s doing an impression, at which point self-consciousness disappears because she is no longer herself and thus unthinkingly turns up the volume, and when she\u2019s telling me something she regards as important, and to both make me laugh and to make sure I don\u2019t fuck it up, she yells the words directly into my recorder\u2019s ear. To me, sotto voce, \u201cMy most frequent collaborators at S.N.L. are the incredibly gifted writers,\u201d and then to my recorder, in stereophonic sound, \u201cCHRIS KELLY AND SARAH SCHNEIDER!\u201d) A touchstone for Kate is Molly Shannon\u2019s Mary Katherine Gallagher, the Catholic schoolgirl who\u2019s rough on d\u00e9cor and who sniffs her armpit-dipped fingers when she\u2019s nervous: \u201cMary Katherine is crashing into tables and doing a little dance, and yet she\u2019s so real at the same time. You have to love her so much because she\u2019s a person who\u2019s trying to connect, but is thwarted by everything about who she is. I can relate to that.\u201d It\u2019s the generosity of spirit Shannon brought to the character that Kate responded to, and she brings that same spirit to whomever she\u2019s representing. Says Lorne Michaels, \u201cKate can embody a character and bring it to life and make it funny. But there\u2019s also always something empathetic about her characters. And although the writing might not be kind, she is. That\u2019s her genius. You can\u2019t make the audience fall in love with a character you don\u2019t like.\u201d Kate has begun appearing in big roles in major feature films, most notably in last year\u2019s all-female Ghostbusters reboot, which if it did nothing else served to remind us how weird people can still be about women (the outrage on social media that Columbia Pictures had the gall to remake this towering achievement of cinematic expression with cootie-ridden girls\u2014e-e-e-e-e-u-u-u-u-w!\u2014was as amusing as it was depressing), and this year\u2019s bachelorette-party-gone-bad comedy Rough Night. Kate shines in both, but the movies feel slightly beside the point. Maybe because what she\u2019s doing on S.N.L. feels so essential. There\u2019s the pure political theater of her Hillary, of course. Yet there\u2019s also her Elizabeth Warren, her Kellyanne Conway, her Jeff Sessions. Season 42 of S.N.L. had more eyeballs fastened on it than any season since Season 19 (1993-94), and received more Emmy nominations than any season ever, including for Kate and Baldwin, both of whom would win. Election years can often mean a ratings bounce for the show, only this time that bounce went sky-high and didn\u2019t come back to earth, even after the contest was decided. On Hillary Clinton: \u201cI admire [her] so much, I started to feel very close to her, just trying to imagine her inner life.\u201d Somehow S.N.L. has managed to locate the center of a culture that\u2019s without one, that\u2019s increasingly fractured. Over the last 18 months or so, politics has become the national obsession, what\u2019s pushing us together as a country even as it\u2019s driving us apart. And to end each week with S.N.L., releasing the pent-up anger and frustration and fear and anxiety with laughter, is cathartic. This, too: the eerily symbiotic relationship that has developed between S.N.L. and the White House. S.N.L. watches the White House in order to satirize it; the White House watches the satirization and then offers notes. Trump tweeted after the October 15, 2016, episode, \u201cAlec Baldwin portrayal stinks.\u201d And yet Trump seems beyond influenced by it, seems haunted. Am I nuts or has Trump, since Baldwin debuted his Trump, squinted harder, pooched out his bottom lip farther? (Observes Baldwin, \u201cHe makes this face like he\u2019s snarling and about to leap at you, like he\u2019s in a production of Cats.\u201d) And though purists will argue that Anthony Atamanuik\u2019s Trump or John Di Domenico\u2019s are the more nuanced and artful, it\u2019s Baldwin\u2019s that\u2019s captured the public imagination. Scrambled the imagination, as well. In February, El Nacional, a newspaper in the Dominican Republic, printed a photograph of Baldwin as Trump believing it was Trump. Says Baldwin, \u201cMy thought was that if I did a good impression of Trump it would be dull. So I ran towards this idea that I\u2019m going to do a horrific caricature. When you\u2019re doing an impression, you can suggest the voice, or the way the guy looks, but you\u2019ve really got to think of who he is, and get that right, and I think I did. In terms of the media, I\u2019m Trump now. He\u2019s not even Trump anymore\u2014I am.\u201d Baldwin has considered running for office in the future. I want to propose the ultimate comedic reversal of fortune: Trump, driven so crazy by Baldwin\u2019s Trump, forfeits the presidency to escape it (other contributing factors include the Russia thing, the special-counsel thing, the wee-wee tape thing); Baldwin, having played POTUS on TV, is elected to play POTUS in life, Kate\u2019s Hillary his V.P.; Trump, a two-time S.N.L. host, is recruited by that shrewd barnstormer Lorne Michaels to become the show\u2019s Baldwin. We\u2019re in a world now where such a scenario is, if not plausible, possible. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz; Styled by Jessica Diehl. For Public Consumption \n \n Kate and I start with her professional life, and we stay there for a long time, and we\u2019re doing all right, are cooking with gas, in fact, even if we do encounter the occasional bump in the road. For instance, when I ask her about a dinner she had with Hillary at Orso in late winter (Peter Biskind, a Vanity Fair contributing editor, just happened to be at the restaurant that night: \u201cMost of the diners stood up and there was gaping and scattered applause. And there were lots of what I assume were Secret Service men and they followed Hillary when she went downstairs to the john\u201d), her eyes begin to skitter and jump. I immediately cast around for a less sensitive topic, though I hadn\u2019t realized that one was sensitive. And we continue to do O.K. when I jolt the conversation onto another track, inquire about her family and early career. She grew up on Long Island, Mom a social worker, Dad an architect. Kate was, to her parents\u2019 delight, an arty kid, and a natural cutup. Mel Brooks was a household god. \u201cWe watched The Producers once a week.\u201d So was Christopher Guest. (Kate is, with the exception of Kristen Wiig, the biggest female star to come out of S.N.L. since Tina Fey, and the comparisons between her and her predecessor are both legion and inevitable. They are also, in my opinion, inaccurate. Fey, a former S.N.L. head writer, is brilliant, incisive, withheld, in charge; whether or not she\u2019s technically running the show, she\u2019s running the show; and she\u2019s always Tina Fey, even when she\u2019s, say, Sarah Palin. Kate, though equally brilliant, is brilliant in an entirely different way. She\u2019s a softer, sweeter comic presence, and more anarchic, open to a manic impulse or the zigzagging energy coming off the performers around her, and she disappears into the identity she\u2019s assuming at that moment. And it\u2019s Guest repertory player Catherine O\u2019Hara, she of the elastic face and bugaboo stare and oddball characters who believe they\u2019re perfectly normal, to whom Kate bears the strongest resemblance.) Kate attended Columbia University, where she was part of the Varsity Show, a satirical look at campus life, and whose alumni, incidentally, include Rodgers and Hart. Senior year she went on an audition for a sketch series on Logo and got the job, which gave her the misimpression that breaking into showbiz was easy. \u201cI learned quickly that that was a major fluke and then didn\u2019t get paid again for a long time.\u201d Eventually she landed at the Upright Citizens Brigade, and from there it was on to S.N.L.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Kate McKinnon is dressed down (\"real-person down,\" without makeup and in sneakers and a baggy tee) and skittish like a cat, reacting so warily to her interview with Lili Anolik for Vanity Fair that Anolik realizes she's \"going to have to approach her slowly, carefully, no false moves.\" The writer dives into the career of McKinnon, whom she calls \"perhaps the most gifted of a gifted generation of young comics,\" reaching back to her first forays into comedy at Columbia and her stint with the Upright Citizens Brigade improv group, and culminating with her current turn on SNL, where she's impersonated everyone from Kellyanne Conway and Elizabeth Warren to Jeff Sessions. But it's her portrayal of Hillary Clinton, the foil to Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump, that has touched an unexpected nerve and propelled her to household-name status. Anolik points out the \"intense, instinctive, and visceral\" interaction between the two actors. She also notes how McKinnon's Hillary has more \"pathos\" than versions by previous SNL actors, including Jan Hooks and Amy Poehler. That pathos was born out of the connection McKinnon forged while trying to channel what she believed may have been Clinton's private thoughts. \"I started to feel very close to her, just trying to imagine her inner life,\" McKinnon says. The subject of the real Hillary is broached, though Anolik notes that \"Kate actually says very little \u2026 because she gets too overwhelmed to say it.\" The cat that is McKinnon also backs away on \"soft, padded paws\" when Anolik brings up her personal life, which \"since I'm no cop and Kate's certainly no criminal \u2026 I lean across the table and switch off the tape recorder.\" Anolik's full piece on McKinnon is here.",

    "document": "Mr. Sandusky, after repeated requests, agreed to the interview because he said his decades of work with children had been misunderstood and distorted by prosecutors. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019ve taken everything that I ever did for any young person and twisted it to say that my motives were sexual or whatever,\u201d Mr. Sandusky said. He added: \u201cI had kid after kid after kid who might say I was a father figure. And they just twisted that all.\u201d \n \n Yet over the course of the interview, Mr. Sandusky described what he admitted was a family and work life that could often be chaotic, even odd, one that lacked some classic boundaries between adults and children, and thus one that was open to interpretation \u2014 by those who have defended him as a generous mentor and those who have condemned him as a serial predator. \n \n He said his household in State College, Pa., over the years came to be a kind of recreation center or second home for dozens of children from the charity, a place where games were played, wrestling matches staged, sleepovers arranged, and from where trips to out-of-town sporting events were launched. Asked directly why he appeared to interact with children who were not his own without many of the typical safeguards other adults might apply \u2014 showering with them, sleeping alone with them in hotel rooms, blowing on their stomachs \u2014 he essentially said that he saw those children as his own. \n \n \u201cIt was, you know, almost an extended family,\u201d Mr. Sandusky said of his household\u2019s relationship with children from the charity. He then characterized his close experiences with children he took under his wing as \u201cprecious times,\u201d and said that the physical aspect of the relationships \u201cjust happened that way.\u201d \n \n Wrestling, hugging \u2014 \u201cI think a lot of the kids really reached out for that,\u201d he said. \n \n Mr. Sandusky said his wife, Dorothy, known as Dottie, ultimately had some concerns about the household dynamics. He said she had warned him not to neglect his own children \u2014 the Sanduskys had adopted six children, including one from the Second Mile \u2014 \u201cfor the sake of other kids.\u201d Mr. Sandusky recalled one scene after a Penn State football game that underscored her concerns. \n \n \u201cI remember the kids were downstairs, and we always had dogs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Dottie said, \u2018You better go down and check on those kids, you know those Second Mile kids after football games.\u2019 I went down, and I look, and there goes a kid flying over a couch, there goes a dog flying over a couch. And I go, \u2018I don\u2019t think she wants to see this.\u2019 \u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n He said of his household: \u201cYeah, I mean it was turmoil. It was turmoil.\u201d \n \n During the interview, conducted at the home of his lawyer, Mr. Sandusky was at times subdued, but occasionally capable of humor \u2014 some of it awkward laughter about his legal jeopardy and ruined reputation, some of it bright amusement at a recalled anecdote about his own father, who himself had worked with disadvantaged and disabled children, or a moment of remembered comedy at one of the many summer camps he helped run for children. \n \n He grew most animated when talking about his relationships with children, and he grew most disconsolate when he, with a touch of childlike reverence, spoke of Mr. Paterno and Penn State, and the damage his indictment had caused them. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was fair,\u201d he said. \n \n During the interview, Joseph Amendola, Mr. Sandusky\u2019s lawyer, captured what he asserted was his client\u2019s predicament: \n \n \u201cAll those good things that you were doing have been turned around,\u201d Mr. Amendola said, speaking to his client, \u201cand the people who are painting you as a monster are saying, \u2018Well, they\u2019re the types of things that people who are pedophiles exhibit.\u2019 \u201d \n \n Prosecutors, in their indictment of Mr. Sandusky, charged him with a horrific array of abuse, including the repeated assaults of young boys. \n \n Mr. Sandusky, in the interview, confirmed aspects of what prosecutors have said was a manipulative scheme: he gave money and gifts to Second Mile children, including computers and golf clubs. However, Mr. Sandusky presented his actions in a benevolent light. \n \n \u201cI would call kids on the phone and work with them academically,\u201d he said. \u201cI tried to reward them sometimes with a little money in hand, just so that they could see something. But more often than not, I tried to set up, maybe get them to save the money, and I put it directly into a savings account established for them.\u201d \n \n Sometimes, he said, he found work for the children at his football camps. Sometimes he bought them shoes or a shirt with his money. And sometimes, he passed along gifts to them that had been given to the charity by donors. \u201cI never bought a computer for any kid; I had a computer given to me to give to a kid,\u201d he said. \u201cI never bought golf clubs. People gave things because they knew there would be kids. They wanted to get rid of things.\u201d \n \n It is unclear whether the supervisors or directors of the charity knew of Mr. Sandusky\u2019s setting up bank accounts or giving away donated gifts. Investigators with the Pennsylvania attorney general\u2019s office have subpoenaed the financial records of the charity, but say they have been alarmed to learn that some records from some years are missing. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

An assistant football coach has told investigators that he saw Mr. Sandusky raping a young boy in the football building\u2019s showers, and that he told Mr. Paterno some version of that scene the following day. Mr. Paterno has testified that he then informed the university\u2019s athletic director, Tim Curley, that Mr. Sandusky had done something sexually inappropriate with a young boy. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Sandusky, in the interview, said word of an episode with a young boy in the shower reached Mr. Raykovitz. He said he talked with Mr. Raykovitz, and identified the boy he thought Penn State was concerned about. Mr. Sandusky, though, said Mr. Raykovitz did not see fit to limit his interaction with youths, in part because he was aware of the nature of Mr. Sandusky\u2019s mentoring relationship with the boy, and in part because he knew Mr. Sandusky had undergone repeated background checks clearing him to work with children. \n \n Mr. Raykovitz\u2019s lawyer, Kevin L. Hand, called Mr. Sandusky\u2019s account inaccurate, but refused to say more. \n \n As for Mr. Paterno, Mr. Sandusky said the two never spoke about any incidents, not the episode in 2002 or an earlier complaint of child molestation made against Mr. Sandusky in 1998 that was investigated by the Penn State campus police. \n \n \u201cI never talked to him about either one,\u201d Mr. Sandusky said of Mr. Paterno. \u201cThat\u2019s all I can say. I mean, I don\u2019t know.\u201d \n \n Mr. Paterno, through his son, Scott, has denied knowing about the 1998 investigation at the time it happened. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s the only one who knows whether anybody ever said anything to him,\u201d Mr. Sandusky said of Mr. Paterno. \n \n In the interview, Mr. Sandusky, the longtime defensive coordinator at Penn State, said that his relationships and activities with Second Mile children did cause some strain with Mr. Paterno, but only in that Mr. Sandusky worried that having some of the children with him at hotels before games, or on the sideline during games, risked being seen as a distraction by the demanding Mr. Paterno. \n \n \u201cI would have dreams of we being in a squad meeting and that door fly open and kids come running through chasing one another, and what was I going to do?\u201d he said. \u201cBecause, I mean, Joe was serious about football.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mr. Sandusky, despite expressing concern about talking about the formal charges made against him, did talk about his relationships with several of the eight people cited as victims by prosecutors last month. He said his relationships with more than one of them had extended for years after the suspected episodes of molestation or inappropriate behavior. \n \n In 1998, the mother of a child reported concerns to the Penn State campus police when she learned her son had showered with Mr. Sandusky at the university. After an investigation, Mr. Sandusky admitted to the police and child welfare authorities that he had most likely done something inappropriate, according to prosecutors. The local district attorney declined to prosecute. \n \n In the interview this week, Mr. Sandusky said the boy and his mother remained a part of his life for years. He said that the mother had sought him out for tickets to Penn State games for her son, and that Mr. Sandusky had contributed financially years later, when the young man, interested in the ministry, went on a mission. \n \n \u201cHe went to Mexico in the poverty-stricken areas and worked with the kids and things like that,\u201d Mr. Sandusky said of the young man. \u201cHe showed me, he sent me pictures of he and the kids.\u201d \n \n In the grand jury report, prosecutors cited Mr. Sandusky\u2019s attempts to reach some of his accusers. He acknowledged that he reached out to at least one, but said he thought the young man might be a character witness on his behalf, and was unaware that prosecutors had listed him as a victim. \n \n Asked how he came to be involved more closely with some children rather than others, Mr. Sandusky said he got to know many of them at Second Mile summer camps. \n \n \u201cSome of them sought me out,\u201d Mr. Sandusky said. \n \n Mr. Sandusky, facing grave charges and the possibility of imprisonment, discussed how much was now missing from his life, and how much more might be missing in the future. \n \n \u201cI miss coaching,\u201d he said. \u201cI miss Second Mile. I miss Second Mile kids. I miss interrelationships with all kinds of people. I miss my own grandkids. I miss, I mean you know I\u2019m going to miss my dog. So, I mean, yeah, I miss, yeah. Good grief. \n \n \u201cI used to have a lot of contact with a lot of people and so that circle is diminished, and as it diminished, you know Bo is still there,\u201d he said of his dog. \u201cAnd I swear he understands. I swear he knows. And you know I love him dearly for that.\u201d ||||| The former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky, in his first extended interview since his indictment on sexual abuse charges last month, said Coach Joe Paterno never spoke to him about any suspected misconduct with minors. Mr. Sandusky also said the charity he worked for never restricted his access to children until he became the subject of a criminal investigation in 2008. \n \n The failure by Mr. Paterno to act more aggressively after being told in 2002 that Mr. Sandusky had molested a 10-year-old boy in the showers of the university\u2019s football building played a role in Mr. Paterno\u2019s firing last month after 62 years at Penn State. Mr. Sandusky, in the interview, said that Mr. Paterno did not speak to him or confront him over the accusation, despite the fact that Mr. Sandusky had been one of his assistant coaches for three decades and was a regular presence at the football team\u2019s complex for years after the 2002 episode. \n \n Mr. Sandusky, in a nearly four-hour interview over two days this week, insisted he had never sexually abused any child, but he confirmed details of some of the events that prosecutors have cited in charging him with 40 counts of molesting young boys, all of whom came to know Mr. Sandusky through the charity he founded, known as the Second Mile. \n \n Mr. Sandusky said he regularly gave money to the disadvantaged boys at his charity, opened bank accounts for them, and gave them gifts that had been donated to the charity. \n \n Prosecutors have said Mr. Sandusky used such gifts as a way to build a sense of trust and loyalty among boys he then repeatedly abused. \n \n Mr. Sandusky, after repeated requests, agreed to the interview because he said his decades of work with children had been misunderstood and distorted by prosecutors. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019ve taken everything that I ever did for any young person and twisted it to say that my motives were sexual or whatever,\u201d Mr. Sandusky said.

In order to preserve your good work and the work on behalf of all the patriots working to defend America, I still believe it was important to have a meeting where at least in some way discuss and reassure the level and oversight and redundancy of oversight on a program that we all recognize needed extra care and attention and lots of sets of eyes. I hope today in this hearing we were able to do that.\" \n \n 12: 40 p.m ET - \n \n Rep.

Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, asks how damaging the leaks are. \n \n \"I think it was irreversible and significant damage to this nation,\" Alexander said. \n \n \"Has this helped America\u2019s enemies?\" Bachmann asked. \n \n \"I believe it has and I believe it will hurt us and our allies,\" he said. \n \n 12:27 p.m. ET - Rep. Jim Himes, D-Connecticut, asked how many of those 50 episodes would have been thwarted without the use of phone records. \"How essential\u2013not just contributing to\u2013but how essential are these authorities to stop terrorist attacks?\" \n \n Glenn Greenwald, the Guardian journalist who first reported the leaks, asked a similar question on Twitter Tuesday morning. \n \n When officials claim that \"Bulk Surveillance Program X\" stopped Terror plots, must ask: could you have stopped it with narrower program? \u2014 Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) June 18, 2013 \n \n Responding to Himes, Alexander said the surveillance programs are vital to preventing terrorism. \n \n \"Going back to 9/11, we didn't have the ability to connect the dots. This adds one more capability to help us do that,\" Alexander said in response. \"What we're doing here, with the civil liberties and privacy oversight, does help connect the dots.\" \n \n Alexander said 90% of the more than 50 plots were prevented in part because of the online surveillance\u2013not phone records collection\u2013of suspects overseas. \"In 50%, I believe they were critical,\" he said. A little more than 10 of the 50 had a domestic nexus and were thus targeted using phone records. \n \n Sean Joyce, deputy director of Federal Bureau of Investigation, also jumped in with a response to Himes. \n \n \"I think you ask an almost impossible question to say how important each dot was. What I can tell you is post 9/11, I don't recognize the FBI I came into 26 years ago. Our mission is to stop terrorism, to prevent it, not after the fact, to prevent it before it happens in the United States. I can tell you every tool is essential and vital,\" Joyce said. \"You ask: How can you put the value on an American life? And I can tell you it's priceless.\" \n \n 12:20 p.m. ET - Robert S. Litt, general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said NSA leaker Edward Snowden \"wasn't nearly as familiar with these programs as he's portrayed himself to be.\" \n \n \"This is what happens when somebody who sees a tiny corner of things thinks it gives him inside (understanding) into the whole program,\" he said. \n \n 12:01 p.m. ET - Rep. Devin Nunes, R-California, brought up other controversies plaguing the Obama administration\u2013the IRS scandal, \"Fast and Furious,\" Justice Department leak investigations, and the U.S. consulate attack in Benghazi\u2013and asked NSA officials to offer assurance that the agency is not leaking information itself. \n \n Responding, Alexander said all the information the NSA disseminates is \"100% auditable\" and they have \"not seen one of our analysts willfully do something wrong.\" The only mistakes he has seen are \"honest mistakes,\" listing a typo as an example. \n \n Nunes further pressed officials, asking them to explain the seriousness of the leaks. \n \n Sean Joyce, deputy director of Federal Bureau of Investigation, said they're conducting a \"criminal investigation\" and repeatedly described the leaks as \"egregious.\" \n \n \"We are revealing in front of you today methods and techniques. I have told you, the examples I gave you how important they have been. The first core al Qaeda plot to attack the United States post 9-11 we used one of these programs. Another plot to bomb the New York Stock Exchange we used these programs. And now here we are talking about this in front of the world. So I think those leaks affect us,\" he said. \n \n New CNN/ORC Poll: A slight majority of those questioned in the poll disapprove of the actions of the man who leaked sensitive information about the NSA program. And a similar amount say Edward Snowden, who fled to Hong Kong, should be brought back to the U.S. and prosecuted \n \n Snowden: Obama expanded program \n \n 11:36 a.m. ET - Reached by CNNMoney, the New York Stock Exchange declined to comment on the thwarted bomb plot. \n \n Yahoo: What gov. wanted from us \n \n 11:35 a.m. ET - Asked if they plan to release the court opinions on NSA requests for phone and Internet intelligence gathering, Robert S. Litt, general counsel of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, said they are looking into that. \n \n 11:17 a.m ET - Elaborating further on the disrupted terrorist attacks, Sean Joyce, deputy director of Federal Bureau of Investigation, said federal agencies used Internet surveillance\u2013known as PRISM or Section 702 of the Patriot Act\u2013to identify an extremist who was communicating with an individual in Kansas City. They were in the \"very early stages\" of plotting to bomb the New York Stock Exchange, he said. \n \n Asked if their intention to bomb the NYSE was \"serious,\" Joyce said, \"The jury considered it serious since (the suspects) were all convicted.\" \n \n In another instance, Joyce said they used phone records\u2013Section 215\u2013to identify an individual in San Diego who had \"indirect contact\" and who was providing financial support to an extremist outside of the United States. \n \n 11:13 a.m ET - Democratic Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, ranking member on House Intelligence Committee, asked Alexander if he feels like the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is a rubber stamp in the sense that it approves all requests from the NSA to pursue investigations. \n \n Alexander said he does not think the court acts in such a manner and praised the the federal judges on the court as \"superb,\" adding that they \"go back and forth to make sure we do this exactly right.\" \n \n 11:12 a.m. ET - New CNN/ORC Poll: Just over six in ten Americans say they believe that government is so large and powerful that it threatens the rights and freedoms of ordinary Americans. \n \n Obama: I'm no Dick Cheney \n \n 11:10 a.m. ET - House Intelligence Chairman Mike Rogers asks if the NSA has the ability to \"flip a switch\" and listen to Americans' phone calls or read emails \n \n Alexander said they do not have the authority or technology to do that. \n \n 11:04 a.m. ET - Deputy Attorney General James Cole said that because of the leaks, the government runs the risk of losing its capability to operate the collection programs. He did not say why but said they won't know for several months how the leaks affected the agency's surveillance abilities. \n \n 10:57 a.m. ET - Alexander said the NSA does not unilaterally collect information from Internet companies under Section 702. The companies are compelled to provide that information by law, he said. \n \n Facebook, Microsoft disclose information on user data requests \n \n 10:55 a.m. ET - NSA official says phone record data collected under Section 215 must be destroyed five years after acquired. \n \n 10:45 a.m. ET - Sean Joyce, deputy director of Federal Bureau of Investigation, said the surveillance programs\u2013specifically the program that gathers intelligence from Internet companies\u2013helped stop a plot to bomb the office of the Danish newspaper that came under heat for publishing a cartoon of Mohammed in 2006. \n \n In the United States, the program also helped them thwart a plan to bomb the New York City subway system and a plan to bomb the New York Stock Exchange, he said. \n \n Read the full accounts from Joyce below. \n \n New York City subway: \"In the fall of 2009, NSA using 702 authority intercepted an email from a terrorist located in Pakistan. That individual was talking with an individual located inside the United States talking about perfecting a recipe for explosives. Through legal process that individual was identified as Najibullah Zazi. He was located in Denver, Colorado. The FBI followed him to NYC. Later we executed search warrants with the NY joint terrorism task force and NYPD and found bomb making components in backpacks. Zazi later confessed to a plot to bomb the NY subway system with backpacks. Also working with FISA business records the NSA was able to provide a previously unknown number of one of the co-conspirators Adis Medunjanin. This was the first core al Qaeda plot since 9-11 directed from Pakistan.\" \n \n New York Stock Exchange: \"NSA utilizing 702 authority was monitoring a known extremist in Yemen. This individual was in contact with an individual in the United States named Khalid Ouazzani. Ouazzani and other individuals that we identified through a FISA that the FBI applied for through the FISC, were able to detect a nascent plotting to bomb the NYSE. Ouazzani had been providing information and support to this plot. The FBI disrupted and arrested these individuals.\" \n \n Danish newspaper: \"David Headley, a U.S citizen living in Chicago. The FBI received intelligence regarding his possible involvement in the 2008 Mumbai attacks responsible for the killing of over 160 people. Also, NSA through 702 coverage of an al Qaeda affiliated terrorist, found that Headley was working on a plot to bomb a Danish newspaper office that had published the cartoon depictions prophet Muhammad. In fact, Headley later confessed to personally conducting surveillance of the Danish newspaper office. He and his co-conspirators were convicted of this plot.\" \n \n FBI probe: \"Lastly, the FBI had opened an investigation shortly after 9-11. We did not have enough information nor did we find links to terrorism so we shortly thereafter closed the investigation. However, the NSA using the business record FISA, tipped us off that this individual had indirect contacts with a known terrorist overseas. We were able to reopen this investigation, identify additional individuals through the legal process and were able to disrupt this terrorist activity.\" \n \n 10:40 a.m. ET - For Section 702 of the Patriot Act, which permits the collection and surveillance of information from Internet companies, Cole said only those living outside of the United States can be targeted. \n \n 10:30 a.m .ET - Cole said that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to Section 215, the part of the Patriot Act that permits the collection of phone records. \n \n He said people should not expect privacy on such metadata, which includes the phone numbers, the time at which phone conversations took place and the duration of those calls. \n \n 10:25 a.m. ET - Deputy Attorney General James Cole listed some of the criteria for an NSA analyst to access phone conversations. As part of the oversight process, the NSA must get permission from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. \n \n While requesting permission, they must prove that person they want to investigate is involved with some sort of terrorist organization. To prove affiliation, the NSA must have independent evidence aside from personal writings, statements, etc, from the person they want to investigate that the individual is linked to an organization. \n \n \"You have to have additional evidence beyond that that indicates there is reasonable suspicion,\" he said. \n \n Read more: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said Sunday that the NSA was \"not listening to\" Americans' phone calls. \n \n 10:22 a.m. ET - Alexander said they will bring classified documents to Capitol Hill Wednesday that detail all 50 cases in which the NSA programs helped prevent a terror plot. As reported already on CNN, he will present two of those publicly Tuesday. \n \n However, they will not publicly release all of the cases, saying that would give away the NSA's secrets in how it tracks suspected terrorists. \n \n \"Too much is at risk for us and our allies,\" he said. \n \n Alexander described the programs as \"critical\" for the government's counterterrorism efforts. If they had the phone surveillance program\u2013known as Section 215 under the Patriot Act\u2013before the September 11, 2001 attacks, he argued, they may have been able to track phone conversations between one of the hijackers living in San Francisco and a co-conspirator in Yemen. \n \n 10:20 a.m. ET - \"In recent years these programs, together with other intelligence, have protected the U.S. and our allies from terrorist threats across the globe to include helping prevent the potential terrorist events over 50 times since 9-11,\" Alexander said. \n \n 10:19 a.m. ET - In his opening statements, Alexander said the leaked information about the phone records and Internet data sparked \"considerable debate\" in recent days, but the debate has been fueld by \"incomplete and inaccurate information.\" \n \n \"Today we will provide additional detail and context on these programs to help inform that debate,\" he said. \n \n 10:16 a.m. ET - New CNN/ORC Poll: Americans are split on the controversial National Security Agency anti-terrorism program to record metadata on U.S. phone calls, but they support the NSA program that targets records of internet usage by people in other countries. \n \n 10:08 a.m. ET - House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Michigan, made his opening remarks. \n \n \"I look forward to hearing from all of the witnesses about the extensive protections and oversight in place for these programs. General Alexander, we look forward to hearing what you\u2019re able to discuss in an open forum about how the data that you obtain from providers under the Business Records provision is used; and Deputy Attorney General Cole, we look forward to hearing more about the legal authorities themselves, and the state of the law on what privacy protections Americans\u2019 have in business records,\" he said, according to his prepared remarks. \n \n \"General Alexander, you and I have talked over the past week about the need to be able to publicly elaborate on the success stories these authorities have contributed to without jeopardizing ongoing operations,\" he added. \"I place the utmost value in protecting sources and methods, but I also recognize that when we are forced into the position of having to publicly discuss intelligence programs due to irresponsible, criminal behavior that we also have to carefully balance the need for secrecy with educating the public.\"",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The NSA's controversial spying activities have prevented more than 50 terror attacks since 9/11, the agency's director told the House Intelligence Committee today, including attempted bombings of the New York Stock Exchange and, as previously disclosed, the New York City Subway. Gen. Keith Alexander said he'd go over all 50 cases with Congress, but wouldn't release the information to the public because it would give away NSA secrets. More from the hearing, courtesy of Politico and CNN's liveblog. Alexander said 90% of those cases were disrupted by the PRISM web spying program. The NSA said that while it has assembled a massive database of call tracking information, it has targeted fewer than 300 numbers or other \"identifiers\" within it. Deputy Attorney General James Cole stressed that the NSA must get permission from the secret FISA court to access phone data, and must have evidence linking their target to a terrorist organization. \"This is not a program that's off the books that's been hidden away,\" Cole said. But Cole also said that the Fourth Amendment didn't apply to phone records, and that people shouldn't expect privacy for them. NSA Deputy Director Chris Inglis said that just 22 people at the NSA are authorized to query the phone database. Alexander said the NSA has neither the legal authority nor technical ability to \"flip a switch\" and listen to a phone conversation. The NSA brass wasn't exactly facing an inquisition. Committee Chairman Mike Rogers painted the NSA as a victim of \"a constant public drumbeat\" accusing it of a \"laundry list of nefarious things \u2026 all of them wrong.\" He said public trust was waning thanks to \"inaccuracies, half-truths, and outright lies.\"",

Picture taken December 9, 2014. \n \n United Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) said on Tuesday it will start applying surcharges for residential packages this year after its costs soared during the recent disappointing holiday season. \n \n UPS also reported that fourth-quarter profit fell from a year ago but forecast earnings within the range of estimates. \n \n UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, warned in late January it would report a fourth-quarter profit below its forecast and market expectations. \n \n The Atlanta-based company had mobilized more workers and equipment for an anticipated surge in holiday packages, but the extra business failed to materialize. The additional costs primarily affected the company's domestic ground package unit. \n \n As a result of the poor quarter, UPS Chief Executive Officer David Abney said on a conference call that the company would apply surcharges for residential packages in particular. The additional charges will be applied over several years as contracts with major customers are renegotiated. \n \n \"These pricing strategies will be designed to ensure we are properly compensated for the value we provide,\" Abney said. \n \n UPS went through a second consecutive challenging peak season. In 2013, the company was caught off-guard by a late rush of online packages that left an estimated 1.3 million parcels undelivered on Christmas Eve. \n \n UPS spent $500 million last year on network improvements and worked closely with retail customers to prevent a repeat of the miscues in late 2013, but the rising popularity of e-commerce made forecasting volumes a moving target. \n \n UPS forecast full-year 2015 earnings in a range of $5.05 to $5.30 per share. Analysts estimated $5.15 a share this year. \n \n UPS reported fourth-quarter net profit of $1.15 billion, down nearly 2 percent from $1.17 billion a year earlier. \n \n Earnings per share came in at $1.25, unchanged from a year earlier and matching the expectations of analysts. \n \n Quarterly revenue rose 6 percent to $15.9 billion from $15 billion a year earlier, including a 7.5 percent increase in revenue from its domestic ground package business. \n \n Operating expenses jumped more than 20 percent to $9.2 billion from $7.65 billion, which caused a more than 60 percent drop in operating profit at the domestic ground package unit. \n \n On a GAAP basis, the company reported adjusted earnings per share of 49 cents due to pension-related charges. \n \n In early trading, UPS shares were up 1.2 percent at $101.47. \n \n (Reporting by Nick Carey in Detroit; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Jeffrey Benkoe) ||||| United Parcel Service Inc. said Tuesday that its once highly profitable peak season will continue to be a drag on fourth-quarter and full-year earnings even though it plans to boost some prices to try to offset the added expenses of keeping up with increased holiday loads. \n \n The company averaged more than 30 million deliveries a day during the latest holiday season, executives told analysts in their fourth-quarter earnings call. That was about six million more a day than in the same period in 2012 and 75% more than on its average... ||||| UPS Hates Coming To Your House, To Begin Tacking On Surcharges For Residential Delivery \n \n Last week, in advance of its quarterly earnings report, UPS admitted that it over-spent on holiday shipping in 2014 and that it wouldn\u2019t make that mistake again . Today, with those quarterly earnings announced, the company announced how it\u2019s going to make back some of its money \u2014 by tacking on surcharges for residential deliveries. \n \n The surcharges aren\u2019t something that you\u2019ll see immediately applied everywhere, but will be rolled out as UPS renegotiates its shipping contracts with its largest customers, reports Reuters. \n \n \u201cThese pricing strategies will be designed to ensure we are properly compensated for the value we provide,\u201d explained UPS CEO David Abney. \n \n So why put a surcharge on residential deliveries? \n \n According to UPS, because you\u2019re usually only bringing a single package to a home while many businesses receive multiple parcels each day, these home deliveries cost three times what it costs to make deliveries to businesses. \n \n As companies renegotiate their deals with UPS, expect to see fewer free shipping offers or for e-tailers to increase their minimum orders for free shipping. \n \n You should also expect to see a push toward centralized delivery locations, like the Amazon Locker depots that are set up in retail locations like 7-Eleven stores. These allow shippers to bring multiple parcels to one spot where customers can pick them up at their leisure. Don\u2019t be shocked to see Amazon try to make these more attractive, especially for Prime subscribers, and other companies attempt to replicate this model. \n \n After a dismal 2013, in which weather and consumers\u2019 growing love of e-commerce conspired to leave more than a million parcels undelivered by Christmas day, UPS went all-in for 2014, sinking hundreds of millions of dollars into improvements and hiring around 100,000 seasonal workers. And while it all meant that packages were delivered in time for the holidays, there wasn\u2019t enough business for UPS to ultimately recoup those expenses. \n \n \u201cUPS customers were delighted with the high quality service we delivered during the holiday season,\u201d said Abney in a statement. \u201cHowever, the financial results were below our expectations.\u201d",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 It wasn't a very happy holiday season for UPS\u2014for the second year in a row. In 2013, the company landed in hot water over an unexpected surge in gifts needing delivery, resulting in some 1.3 million packages that weren't delivered by Christmas Eve. This year, things went the opposite direction: The company hired an extra 100,000 seasonal workers, Consumerist notes, but the uptick in business didn't quite pan out as hoped. The result of all this is new costs for consumers. UPS plans a surcharge for residential deliveries, set to take effect over the course of a few years, Reuters reports. \"We absolutely will charge our customers more for the extra costs that we had in peak,\" CEO David Abney tells the Wall Street Journal. Home deliveries can place a special burden on the company, it says, because homes typically get just one package at a time, whereas a business might receive a pile. Customers may end up seeing higher shipping costs at online retailers, as well as more emphasis on pickup locations like Amazon Lockers in retail stores, Consumerist notes.",

    "document": "The master sommelier examination has often been called \u201cthe hardest test you\u2019ve never heard of.\u201d Since its inception in 1969, just 274 people have passed the grueling exam, which involves years, sometimes even decades, of preparation. For a wine service professional, it is the crowning achievement of a career. This year, 24 people passed the test, earning the right to add the coveted \u201cMS\u201d suffix to their names. \n \n Now, the exam\u2019s administering body, the Court of Master Sommeliers (CMS), has announced that it will invalidate the results of one portion of this year\u2019s examination. In an Oct. 9 letter sent to all master sommeliers, CMS board chairman Devon Broglie, MS, wrote that the board had \u201creceived a report from outside legal counsel that a member of the Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas disclosed confidential information pertinent to the tasting portion of the 2018 Master Sommelier Diploma Examination prior to the examination.\u201d \n \n Broglie did not name the master sommelier responsible for the information breach, though it seems likely that the person may have been one of the exam proctors. Proctors are master sommeliers who have undergone a rigorous additional training process, typically lasting about four years. \n \n The announcement snatches away the MS title from 23 of the newly anointed sommeliers, four of whom work in the Bay Area: Andrey Ivanov (Bliss Wine Imports), Scott Barber (Green Pin Wines), Vincent Morrow (the soon-to-open One 65 restaurant) and Robert Ord (recently, Treasury Wine Estates). The cost to take each examination is $995. On Oct. 10, the CMS announced that the 23 candidates will have two chances to re-take the test, one later in 2018 and another in spring or summer 2019. The testing fees for the tasting portion of the 2018 exam, and all fees for these subsequent exams, will be refunded, and assistance with travel expenses will be offered. \n \n Morgan Harris, head sommelier of the Angler in S.F., is the sole member of the class of 2018 whose title remains valid. That\u2019s because Harris had passed the tasting portion of the exam last year, and had only to pass the service portion this year. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking and incredibly disappointing for me and for everyone else who passed the exam in a fair and honest way,\u201d Harris said. \n \n The information breach, Broglie said in his letter, pertains only to the tasting portion of this year\u2019s exam. The tasting portion is what first made the exam the object of popular fascination: In 25 minutes, a candidate must taste six wines, blind, and identify each one\u2019s grape variety, region of origin and vintage. There are two other sections to the exam, theory (a 50-minute verbal exam on geography, winemaking methods, grape varieties, etc.); and practical (a simulation of restaurant service). If a candidate passes one section but fails another \u2014 and almost all do \u2014 she can come back to take the failed portion the next year. Many candidates take five or more years to complete all three. \n \n Harris had no inkling of any foul play during the examination process last month in St. Louis. \u201cNot in the five years I took the exam did anybody talk to me about any wines,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody talks about (the) tasting (portion of the exam) in particular, because it\u2019s such a mind game.\u201d The CMS goes to special lengths to prevent opportunities for cheating, he added, by sequestering candidates before and after the exam. Even after a candidate has passed the tasting portion of the exam, she will never learn the identities of the wines. \n \n Nor did Harris have any idea about who the offending master sommelier \u2014 and his or her candidate accomplice \u2014 might be. \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine in what universe you would work so hard to achieve something that you\u2019re then actively invalidating,\u201d he said. The person has been barred from any CMS events, and Broglie wrote that the board is initiating the process of terminating the person\u2019s membership, which would include his or her master sommelier title. \n \n The news is sending shock waves throughout the sommelier community, which tends to regards its myriad examinations with an air of religiosity. Credentials like those administered by the CMS are not requirements for most sommelier jobs, but they\u2019re becoming increasingly popular among somms who want to advance their careers \u2014 and put their palates to the ultimate challenge. The success of the \u201cSomm\u201d documentary series, which just released its third film, has only added to the MS exam\u2019s aura. \n \n For those who took the Master Sommelier Diploma Examination in September, it was the final step in a long, many-step journey. In order to qualify to take it, candidates must first have passed a series of other tests, including the Advanced Sommelier Examination. The CMS website claims that about 25 to 30 percent of test takers pass the Advanced exam, and only about 10 percent pass the theory portion of the Master exam. \n \n Passing the final test can mean a significant material difference in a somm\u2019s life. An advanced sommelier in the U.S. earns an average salary of $87,000, while a master earns an average of $164,000, according to a 2017 GuildSomm survey. \n \n There will be an \u201cexpedited process\u201d for the 2018 candidates to re-take the tasting examination, Broglie assured, but did not share any details. \n \n That must come as an enormous blow to the 23 professionals who must now sit, all over again, for an exam that some of them have been attempting to pass for decades. \n \n Still, agonizing as it must be for his friends and colleagues, Harris trusts that the CMS board is acting in all of their best interest, by protecting the reputation of the master sommelier title. \u201cThe decision that was made is the only one that could be made,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause the organization is the certification. \n \n \u201cI know that\u2019s why the decision was made \u2014 to maintain the integrity of the exam.\u201d \n \n Update: This story was updated on Oct. 10 to reflect the CMS\u2019 announcement of the protocol for the re-tests. \n \n Esther Mobley is The Chronicle\u2019s wine critic. Email: emobley@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @Esther_mobley Instagram: @esthermob ||||| \n \n Only 273 people in the world have passed the master sommelier exam. (iStock) \n \n Watching a sommelier blindly taste a flight of wines, figuring out their origins right down to the grapevine in a French village, is like watching a magician try to guess your card: You don\u2019t believe it\u2019s possible until they\u2019re right. \n \n Then, of course, you want to know how they did it. \n \n For master sommeliers, there is no simple explanation. The expert wine stewards spend years and thousands of dollars preparing for the master sommelier examination, seen as one of the toughest tests in the world administered by the Court of Master Sommeliers. Since its inception in 1969, only 273 people have ever passed the three-part test, according to the court\u2019s website, with the blind tasting being the hardest part of the exam. In 25 minutes, sommeliers must identify and describe six wines, the exact region each came from and the year each was harvested \u2014 the part that might as well be a magic trick. \n \n Only that this year, somebody really did pull a fast one. \n \n The Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas announced on Tuesday that it would have to invalidate the blind-tasting test results for all 54 candidates in the class of 2018 because of \u201cclear evidence\u201d of cheating. In turn, the court would have to take back the diplomas from 23 newly minted master sommeliers who had just passed the exam last month in St. Louis. \n \n One of the court\u2019s masters \u201cbreached the confidentiality\u201d of the test after releasing \u201cdetailed information concerning wines in the tasting flight\u201d ahead of time, according to the court. The master was not identified, and it was unclear who received the information. A spokeswoman for the court told The Washington Post on Wednesday that she could not offer more details for the time being. \n \n Devon Broglie, a master sommelier and chairman of the Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas board of directors, said the board understood that the decision would come \u201cas a shock\u201d to the new masters but that it had to be done. \n \n \u201cMaintaining the integrity of the examination process must be our highest priority, lest we risk diminishing the value of, and the respect earned from, becoming a Master Sommelier,\u201d Broglie said in a statement on Tuesday. \u201cOur credential is known throughout the hospitality industry worldwide, and it guarantees that the holder of the Master Sommelier title is among the most qualified of all wine industry professionals. A compromised examination does not provide that guarantee.\u201d \n \n The board has since \u201cbarred\u201d the master from participating in any programs or events and has voted unanimously to terminate the master\u2019s membership in the organization. \n \n Morgan Harris, the only master sommelier in the class of 2018 whose diploma was not invalidated, told The Post the sommelier community is a small one and this scandal has left it devastated. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s so profoundly disappointing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tremendous amount of waste and heartbreak for everybody who passed in an honest way and who now have to reprove something they\u2019ve already proven.\u201d \n \n Candidates have three years to pass the three portions of the master sommelier exam. Before they can attempt it, they must have completed the introductory course, certification exam and advanced sommelier exam. The final test has three parts: theory, requiring vast knowledge of virtually every wine region in the world; tableside service, and lastly, the blind tasting. \n \n Harris said that mastering it requires sacrifice, adding that the 23 people who earned diplomas had devoted their lives to the exam. He was among them but said he was only lucky. Because he had already passed the tasting portion of the exam in 2017, this year he needed to pass only the service portion, which was not affected by the scandal. \n \n \u201cThere are people who have put relationships, marriages, parenting of their children on hold so they can make sure they\u2019re professionally successful at this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sounds crazy, but that\u2019s the whole idea: You pass the exam, and you\u2019re done.\u201d \n \n Now they\u2019re not done. Harris said it took him four years to pass the master sommelier exam. Even though he earned the distinction, Harris said, that doesn\u2019t mean he could pass every blind tasting he attempted \u2014 meaning the 23 people forced to retake the tasting may not pass it again. \n \n The Court of Master Sommeliers welcomes the class of 2018! Congratulations to 24 new Master Sommeliers! #MSDiplomaExam pic.twitter.com/BA9kNk22zy \u2014 Master Sommelier US (@MasterSommUS) September 5, 2018 \n \n After the sommeliers passed the exam last month in St. Louis, they celebrated their achievement with glasses of champagne. In interviews with local press, some said they had spent thousands of dollars and had been trying and failing for years before breathing a massive sigh of relief once they finally passed the test. \n \n Maximilian Kast told the News & Observer this was the eighth time he attempted the master exam, having worked his way up from the introduction course starting in 2006. Andrey Ivanov told St. Louis Magazine that it took him nine years, four failed attempts and \u201cmountains of credit card debt\u201d to get to this point. He said he probably spent $60,000 to $70,000 to cover the cost of his education, travel and endless bottles of wine for his studies. \n \n Steven McDonald told the Houston Chronicle after he passed that he was \u201cfloating.\u201d \n \n \u201cI know what he\u2019s feeling,\u201d Guy Stout, who became a master sommelier in 2005 and mentored McDonald, told the Chronicle. \u201cYou\u2019re on cloud nine, like the world has lifted off your shoulders. All those hours you\u2019ve put in . . . to grab the ring is really great.\u201d \n \n On Wednesday, the Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas said it would refund the fees the candidates paid to take the tasting exam and would offer two opportunities to retake it. \n \n \u201cThere are no words I can say that will take away the disappointment and anger that our candidates are feeling,\u201d Broglie, the chairman, said in a statement. \u201cI can only imagine how hard it hit everyone to learn that something they worked so hard for was tainted by the actions of a single individual.\u201d ||||| October 9, 2018 \n \n FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE \n \n CONTACT: Kathleen Lewis (707) 255-5056 x11, klewis@mastersommeliers.org \n \n Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas Board of Directors Takes Unanimous Actions to Preserve Integrity of Examination Process \n \n NAPA, CA \u2013 The Board of Directors of the Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas unanimously voted to invalidate the results of the tasting portion of the 2018 Master Sommelier Diploma Examination for all candidates due to clear evidence that a Master breached the confidentiality with respect to the wines presented for tasting. \n \n \u201cMaintaining the integrity of the examination process must be our highest priority, lest we risk diminishing the value of, and the respect earned from, becoming a Master Sommelier,\u201d said Devon Broglie, MS, Chairman of the Board. \u201cOur credential is known throughout the hospitality industry worldwide, and it guarantees that the holder of the Master Sommelier title is among the most qualified of all wine industry professionals. A compromised examination does not provide that guarantee.\u201d \n \n The Board of Directors found sufficient evidence that the tasting portion of the 2018 Master Sommelier Diploma Examination was compromised by the release of detailed information concerning wines in the tasting flight. The Board unanimously voted to fully void those results to protect the integrity of not only the examination process but also the reputation of the Court of Master Sommeliers and the title Master Sommelier. \n \n \u201cWe understand this decision is a shock to those who recently passed this examination, and we carefully considered the impact our decision has on our newly pinned Masters and their careers,\u201d Broglie said. \u201cWe are committed to developing an expedited process so that all eligible candidates can retake the tasting examination.\u201d \n \n The Board of Directors has barred the Master involved from participating in any Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas programs or events and has voted unanimously to initiate the process of terminating membership pursuant to the organization\u2019s bylaws. \n \n \u201cOur honor and integrity are the best safeguards for preserving the reputation of the Court of Master Sommeliers, our members, and our industry as a whole,\u201d Broglie said. \u201cMaintaining the integrity of the examination process must be our highest priority, lest we risk diminishing the value of, and the respect earned from, becoming a Master Sommelier.\u201d \n \n ABOUT THE COURT OF MASTER SOMMELIERS, AMERICAS \n \n The Court of Master Sommeliers was established in England in 1977 to encourage improved standards of beverage knowledge and service in hotels and restaurants. The first Master Sommelier Diploma Exam to be held in the United States was in 1987. The title Master Sommelier marks the highest recognition of wine and spirits knowledge, beverage service abilities, and professionalism in the hospitality trade. Education was then, and remains today, the Court\u2019s charter. \n \n There are four stages involved in attaining the top qualifications of Master Sommelier: 1) Introductory Sommelier Examination; 2) Certified Sommelier Examination; 3) Advanced Sommelier Examination; and 4) Master Sommelier Diploma Examination.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The exam to become a master sommelier is notoriously difficult. The years, even decades, of study required to conquer the three-part test of wine knowledge\u2014broken down into theory, table service, and tasting\u2014mean that fewer than 300 people have managed it over 49 years. Now 23 sommeliers who thought they'd joined the upper ranks last month will have to do it over again. The Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas announced Tuesday it would invalidate the results of the blind tasting administered in St. Louis because of \"clear evidence\" of cheating.

Harris was the only master sommelier in the class of 2018. \u2013 A cheating scandal has struck the world of wine, with the master sommelier now out of a job. Per the San Francisco Chronicle, the Certification and Management Society, which oversees the title, announced this week that it had uncovered evidence of \"irregularities\" during last month's tasting portion of the Master Sommelier Diploma Examination, which is the final step in the sommelier's journey to the title. In a statement, the CMS says it has \"zero tolerance\" for cheating and that it has notified the 23 candidates who were supposed to sit for the tasting portion last month that they'll have to take a re-test. It's not clear how the alleged cheating occurred, but the Chronicle notes that the exam is \"such a mind game\" that even after a candidate has passed, she won't be able to learn the identities of the wines. \"I just can't imagine in what universe you would work so hard to achieve something that you're then actively invalidating,\" the president of the GuildSomm tells the paper, adding that he doesn't know who the alleged cheater is and that he didn't even know the CMS had sequestered candidates before and after the exam. The alleged cheater has been barred from any CMS events \u2013 Only 273 people have ever passed the master sommelier exam, which is why it's \"profoundly disappointing\" that 23 of this year's master sommeliers will have their diplomas revoked. The Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas announced Tuesday that it would have to invalidate the blind-tasting test results for all 54 candidates in the class of 2018 because of \"clear evidence\" of cheating, the Washington Post reports. The court says one of its masters \"breached the confidentiality\" of the test after releasing \"detailed information concerning wines in the tasting flight\" ahead of time. It's not clear who received the information, but the court says it will re-test the candidates. \"Our credential is known throughout the hospitality industry worldwide, and it guarantees that the holder of the Master Sommelier title is among the most qualified of all wine industry professionals,\" says Devon Broglie, a master sommelier and chairman of the court's board of directors. \"A compromised examination does not provide that guarantee.\" Morgan Harris, the only master sommelier in the 2018 class whose diploma was not invalidated, tells the Post the sommelier community is a small one and this scandal has left it devastated. \"It's a tremendous amount of waste and heartbreak for everybody who passed in \u2013 \"It sounds crazy, but that's the whole idea: You pass the exam, and you're done.\" That's how one master sommelier describes his four years of study\u2014and four failed attempts\u2014to earn his diploma from the Court of Master Sommeliers. Twenty-four of his fellow sommeliers are now out of a job after a fellow student was caught cheating on the master sommelier exam last month, the New York Times reports. According to the Washington Post, the exam was given to a student who was supposed to be taking part in a mock blind tasting at a St. Louis event. Instead, the student was allowed to take part in the actual exam, which was held the following day in California. The result: 23 of the 24 master sommeliers who passed the exam are no longer allowed to wear their diplomas. The students will be given the option to retake the exam or receive a refund for the fees they paid to take it. \u201cI can only imagine how hard it hit everyone to learn that something they worked so hard for was tainted by the actions of a single individual,\u201d Court ofMaster Sommeliers, Americas Chairman Vincent Broglie says in a statement. Some of the students say they've spent thousands of dollars studying for years to \u2013 The world's top sommeliers say they're \"disappointed and angry\" at one of their own. Devon Broglie, chairman of the Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas, announced Wednesday that the organization had decided to \"fully void\" the results of the tasting portion of this year's Master Sommelier Diploma Examination \"due to clear evidence that a Master breached the confidentiality with respect to the wines presented for tasting.\" Candidates who recently passed the exam are being refunded the fees they paid, and the organization says it will offer two opportunities to retake the tasting exam. \"There are no words I can say that will take away the disappointment and anger that our candidates are feeling,\" Broglie said in a statement. \"I can only imagine how hard it hit everyone to learn that something they worked so hard for was tainted by the actions of a single individual.\" The statement says the Board of Directors found \"sufficient evidence\" that the tasting flight was \"compromised by the release of detailed information concerning wines in thetasting flight,\" the New York Times reports. \"The Board unanimously voted to fully void those results to protect the integrity of not only the examination process but also the reputation of the court of master Sommeliers and the title Master Sommelier.\" The title of Master",

    "document": "The search continues for Phylicia Simone Barnes, a star high school student from North Carolina who went missing in Baltimore last week. The 16-year-old honor student from Monroe, N.C., was visiting her half-sister when she disappeared three days after Christmas. \n \n Phylicia was last heard from Dec.28 via Facebook when she posted a note saying she was at her sister's apartment with her sister's boyfriend. The 5 foot 8 inch straight-A, African-American student has been missing ever since. \n \n \"I was going to turn this city upside down to find my child, and I was going to leave no stone unturned,\" Russell Barnes, Phylicia's father, told ABC News. \n \n The FBI and Baltimore police are conducting the investigation. Baltimore Metro Crime Stoppers has offered a cash reward of up to $2,000 for her discovery. \n \n Police told ABC News today that they obtained additional security video from the area surrounding the apartment, but it has yet to shed new light on the case. FBI helicopters have scoured the area for three days without finding any clues. \n \n \"If there's any good news, we haven't found anything yet,\" Baltimore Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said. \n \n \"We've thrown every single tool, trick, machine, widget that we have in our law enforcement toolbox. And ten days later we still have nothing.\" \n \n Police say several people who visited the apartment are considered persons of interest, and the two likely scenarios proposed by investigators are abduction or murder. \n \n \"At this point, you hope it's an abduction,\" Guglielmi said. \n \n Janice Sallis, Phylicia's mother, said, \"If she's alive, she's scared to death.\" \n \n \"Our goal is to find our sweet beautiful sister, daughter, niece, friend - that's what she is to everyone,\" said Phylicia's father, Russell Barnes. \n \n Aside from Baltimore and her hometown near Charlotte, N.C., Phylicia's disappearance has garnered little media attention, raising the issue of a double-standard because of her race. \n \n \"I can't see how this case is any different from Natalee Holloway,\" Guglielmi said. \"Is it because she's African-American? Why?\" \n \n Question of Double-Standard Arises \n \n The dissappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway while on vacation in Aruba nearly six years ago sparked a media frenzy. But news coverage has been relatively sparse in Phylicia's case. \n \n Speaking about the lack of national media coverage, the Baltimore Police spokesman said, \"Birds are falling out of the sky in Arkansas and two headed calves, and this girl may lose her life.\" \n \n The Baltimore Mayor's office says it shares the concern about the possible existence of a double-standard in the coverage of Phylicia's disappearance but is more distressed about the case because of its heartbreaking nature. \n \n \"You see other cases that get attention, other kids that go missing and its immediately up on television and you know, I know there's frustration,\" said Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake. \n \n Nearly 9,000 people have joined a Facebook page called, \"Pray for Phylicia Barnes.\" The charter school Phylicia attends in North Carolina, Union Academy, held a vigil for the promising student. \n \n \"Just so scared, just praying that she's going to turn up and she'll be safe and sound,\" Lindsey Helms, a student at Union Academy, said. \n \n Her father said, \"Phylicia had a bright spirit and just a glow about herself. Our greatest hope is that she can walk in the door and ... be reunited with her family.\" ||||| Baltimore Police Department \n \n Sponsored Links \n \n Authorities in Maryland are stepping up efforts to locate Phylicia Barnes , a 16-year-old North Carolina girl who disappeared while visiting relatives in Baltimore . But a local police official said the national media need to take note of the case.\"We are doing everything we can,\" Baltimore police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi told AOL News, noting that more than 35 detectives are working on the case, as well as two teams from the FBI.\"We would really like the national outlets to help us out here, so if somebody sees her in Missouri, they are able to alert authorities quickly,\" Guglielmi continued. \"It has been incredibly frustrating for me. We've been pitching this since the 29th [and] have not gotten any traction. This case is no different than the Natalee Holloway case. The only difference is Phylicia is from North Carolina, she went missing in Baltimore and she is African-American.\"Guglielmi added, \"I just think if we could get America just to see her picture -- that is all we are asking -- maybe that will lead detectives to a break and save this young lady's life.\"Phylicia lives in Monroe, N.C., but was visiting relatives in Baltimore. She was last seen around 2:30 p.m. on Dec. 28, when she left the apartment of her 27-year-old half-sister, Deena Barnes . According to relatives, Phylicia told her sister she was going shopping.What happened to the teenager next remains a mystery, police said.\"Time is working against us,\" Guglielmi said. \"She has been missing 10 days. ... This is not a runaway. We suspect some type of foul play. The question is, What kind of foul play?\"Investigators are preparing to examine video footage and process additional search warrants in the case, police said.\"We got some new footage [from] an apartment complex in the area, so we are reviewing that,\" Guglielmi said. \"We are continuing interrogations, [and] we have a couple more search warrants and things to process.\"Family members have described Phylicia as a straight-A student who was to graduate early from Union Academy in Monroe and planned to go to Towson University in Maryland. Her father, Russell Barnes, has said it is out of character for her to take off without notifying someone.There has been no activity on any of Phylicia's social-networking accounts, and police say her cell phone has been turned off since the day of her disappearance.Authorities are looking at two possible scenarios in the case, Guglielmi said. The first is that someone in the Baltimore area did \"something terrible to her.\" The second is that she was abducted and taken elsewhere, he said.Anyone who had contact with Phylicia in the hours leading up to her disappearance is considered a person of interest, police said. According to Guglielmi, Phylicia's half-sister's lifestyle makes the potential suspect pool large and difficult to narrow down.\"[Phylicia's] sister is college-age, and she had a lot of friends coming in and out,\" he said. \"I would describe it probably like a dorm room setting. They party, maybe do a little drinking, [but] there is no activity there that concerned us -- no illicit drug use or sex parties or anything ridiculous. She was just a young lady with a lot of friends, [and] that makes our job difficult.\"Authorities have conducted interviews with all of the individuals whom they know were present at the apartment on the day Phylicia went missing. They are now interviewing those individuals again to see if their stories are consistent, police said.Investigators have also served a search warrant at the half-sister's apartment. Items of interest have since been sent to the FBI lab in Quantico, Va.\"We have taken out pieces of bedding and pieces of flooring, but we haven't gotten any smoking gun in terms of the case,\" Guglielmi said. \"A couple more evidentiary things have to be processed, but it is a bit frustrating for detectives because usually you are guided by some kind of physical evidence, and in this case, so far we haven't been able to find anything.\"The FBI's Baltimore branch confirmed to AOL News that it is assisting in the investigation.\"We have a unit here in Baltimore called the Crimes Against Children Unit, which is assisting the Baltimore police homicide unit in trying to locate Ms. Barnes,\" Special Agent Rich Wolf said.Wolf declined to comment on any specifics about the case and directed questions back to the police department.In the past week, authorities have conducted multiple searches for Phylicia in and around the area of the apartment complex where she was last seen, but so far nothing of interest has been found. Authorities are now hoping that billboards donated by Clear Channel Communications might help bring some new leads in the case. The billboards, which display Phylicia's photo and vital information, are being put up along Interstate 95 from Baltimore to New York City, police said.Authorities have set up a special tip line. Anyone with information on Phylicia's disappearance should call 855-223-0033. The FBI has also posted her vital information and photo on its website",

    "document": "Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter \n \n / Updated / Source: & Other Stories By Eun Kyung Kim \n \n Charlie Sheen revealed he is HIV positive Tuesday in an exclusive TODAY interview with Matt Lauer. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a hard three letters to absorb. It\u2019s a turning point in one\u2019s life,\u201d the 50-year-old actor said. \n \n Sheen said he made the announcement to end a smear campaign and extortion efforts. \n \n \u201cI have to put a stop to this onslaught, this barrage of attacks and of sub-truths and very harmful and mercurial stories that are about me, threatening the health of so many others that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth,\u201d he said. \n \n READ: Charlie Sheen pens an open letter about his HIV-positive diagnosis \n \n Sheen said he\u2019s trusted the diagnosis with people he thought he could confide in, but has paid out upwards of $10 million to keep the illness a secret. \n \n \u201cWhat people forget is that that's money they're taking from my children,\u201d he said about the \u201cshakedowns\u201d he has experienced. \u201cI trusted them and they were deep in my inner circle, and I thought they could be helpful. My trust turned to their treason.\u201d \n \n He said appearing on TODAY will help put a stop to those payouts. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s my goal. That\u2019s not my only goal. I think I release myself from this prison today,\u201d he said. \n \n Sheen said he was diagnosed roughly four years ago, but doesn\u2019t know how he contracted the virus. \n \n \u201cIt started with what I thought was a series of crushing headaches,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought I had a brain tumor. I thought it was over.\u201d \n \n He also insisted it was \u201cimpossible\u201d that he knowingly transmitted the virus to others. While he admitted to having unprotected sex with two people since the diagnosis, both were informed ahead of time and have been under the care of his doctor. But Sheen dismissed the idea that he engaged in high-risk behaviors. \n \n \"You're talking about needles and that whole mess? No, definitely not,\" he said. \n \n HIV is the virus that leads to AIDS, which has no cure. But \u201cCharlie does not have AIDS,\u201d said the actor\u2019s physician, Dr. Robert Huizenga, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. \n \n While an HIV-positive diagnosis used to be considered a death sentence, and there still is no cure, medical advancements have helped turn it into a manageable illness. However, antiviral drugs must be taken for a lifetime. \n \n Sheen revealed he takes four pills every day, and his doctor said the main battle facing the actor is not related to HIV, but relapsing into substance abuse problems or entering into depression related to his diagnosis. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re petrified about Charlie. We\u2019re so, so anxious that if he was overly depressed, if he was abusing substance, he would forget these pills and that\u2019s been an incredible worry,\u201d he said. However, he said Sheen has been vigilant about his regimen. \n \n \u201cMagically, somehow in the midst of incredible personal mayhem, he\u2019s managed to continue to take these medications,\u201d Huizenga said. \n \n Matt Lauer interviews Charlie Sheen in a TODAY Show exclusive interview. Samantha Okazaki \n \n Sheen said he hopes by going public with the diagnosis, it will help dispel the stigma of HIV. \n \n \u201cI have a responsibility now to better myself and to help a lot of other people and hopefully with what we\u2019re doing today others will come forward and say, 'Thanks, Charlie,'\u201d he said. \n \n READ MORE: What Charlie Sheen's HIV announcement means for his health \n \n Sheen said he told ex-wives Denise Richards and Brooke Mueller about the diagnosis when he found out. He also shared the news recently with his oldest daughter. \n \n \u201cIt hit her hard, but she recovered. She\u2019s tough like her dad,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you sooner, but it didn\u2019t seem like you could do anything for me and I didn\u2019t want to burden you with all the stress.\u2019 But she was a rock star about it.\u201d \n \n Sheen's personal announcement Tuesday renewed a spotlight on Sheen\u2019s troubled history with drug addiction, pornography and prostitutes. \n \n Charlie Sheen and ex-girlfriend Bree Olson on the red carpet in 2011. Daniel Boczarski / Getty Images Contributor \n \n Sheen rose to become one of Hollywood\u2019s best-known actors through a series of memorable movie roles including \"Wall Street\" and \"Red Dawn.\" In more recent years, however, his public persona was shaped by a public meltdown during his 2011 feud with the creator of \u201cTwo and a Half Men,\u201d the television series that helped him become the highest-paid television actor at the time. In the end, Sheen was fired from the show. \n \n He told Lauer that his behavior at the time had little to do with his diagnosis. \n \n \u201cI wish I could blame it on that,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was more of a (ste)roid rage. This was on the heels of that.\u201d \n \n Sheen admitted that period was not one he looks back fondly on. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a lot out there I\u2019m not proud of. You can only hear \u2018winning\u2019 in the streets so many times,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve pissed off a lot of really good opportunities.\u201d \n \n WATCH: Sheen reveals, 'I'm HIV positive,' paid many who threatened to expose me \n \n But he said he\u2019s entering a more thoughtful and reflective phase in his life. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m approaching a time of more of a philanthropic approach in my life,\u201d he said. He admitted that paying off people to keep quiet about his condition, as well as other factors, has hurt his bank account. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not great. It will be great again. I\u2019m a survivor. I\u2019ve been up, I\u2019ve been down, I\u2019ve been rich, I\u2019ve been poor,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s another chapter in my life but it\u2019s not commerce driven. It\u2019s socially driven.\u201d \n \n Charlie Sheen talks about his HIV-positive diagnosis with Matt Lauer. TODAY \n \n He said he doubts his HIV positive status will have an impact on his future career, pointing out a conversation he is having with the chairman of Sony, who he said is \u201cexcited about doing a show again.\u201d \n \n He also said he has several films lined up. \n \n \u201cThus far, there\u2019s been no resistance,\u201d he said. \n \n Sheen wouldn\u2019t predict how the general media will respond to his interview, but expected his comments at least will dispel some of the myths written about him. \n \n \u201cI would have faith that it will be a lot more forgiving and a lot more supportive than some of the garbage I was reading in the last couple of days. Frankly, I don\u2019t think it can get worse that that,\u201d he said about tabloid stories that insisted he was intentionally infecting others with HIV. \u201cI just thought, \u2018Wow. Damn. That\u2019s just as far from the truth as anything could be.' They\u2019re going to reveal a whole lot of proof because it\u2019s just not there. It does not exist.\u201d \n \n After hearing some of the encouraging reaction people on social media have had to his announcement, Sheen said he\u2019d gladly \u201cride this wave of support.\u201d \n \n \u201cIf there was one guy on this planet to contract this that\u2019s going to deliver a cure, it\u2019s me. It\u2019s me. Seriously,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not going to be the poster man for this, but I will not shun away from responsibilities and opportunities that drive me to helping others.\u201d ||||| The global goal to provide HIV treatment to 15 million people by the end of 2015 has been met\u2014and the milestone even came ahead of schedule, UNAIDS announced in a report released this week, highlighting enormous progress made in achieving one of the U.N.\u2019s Millennium Development Goals. \n \n \u201cWe are on the way to a generation free of AIDS,\u201d declared U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who was speaking at a global development summit in the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa on Tuesday. \u201cNow we must commit to ending the AIDS epidemic.\u201d \n \n So, Why Should You Care? This is a huge boost in the number of people around the world receiving much-needed antiretroviral drugs for HIV treatment. Comparatively, fewer than 700,000 people in the early aughts had access to treatment. Several factors have led to the success, including legislation allowing countries to produce their own copies of drugs at lower prices and increased global investment. Back in 2000, eight pills per day could cost a patient $10,000 per year, thanks to large drug companies with a monopoly on pricing and distribution; today, those medicines can be purchased for $100 per year, according to the report. Despite this progress, however, nearly 37 million people around the world live with HIV, 70 percent of whom reside in sub-Saharan Africa (66 percent of all new HIV infections occurred in the region in 2014). In addition, new infections in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa have increased by 25 percent since 2000. \n \n \u201cDuring the first decade of the epidemic, there was very little to offer someone dying from AIDS,\u201d UNAIDS chief Michel Sidib\u00e9 wrote in the report\u2019s introduction. \u201cThe best you could hope for was that your family wouldn\u2019t throw you out.\u201d \n \n \u201cIf we had stayed complacent, 30 more million people would have been infected with HIV, 7.8 million more would have died, and 8.9 million more children would have been orphaned due to AIDS,\u201d Sidib\u00e9 wrote. \n \n Global investment went up from just under $5 billion in 2000 to $20 billion in 2014, according to the report. As a result, AIDS-related deaths have fallen 40 percent since 2004 and HIV infections by 35 percent since 2000. \n \n The bigger goal now is making sure that 90 percent of those living with HIV are diagnosed and can begin receiving treatment, according to the U.N. The ultimate milestone: End the AIDS epidemic by 2030. \n \n But progress will also have to address cultural and legal roadblocks. \n \n \u201cStigma, discrimination, and punitive laws continue to affect the people most impacted by HIV and to block their access to HIV services in every region of the world,\u201d the report said. \u201cThe criminalization of sex work, drug use, and same-sex sexual relationships among consenting adults hinders attempts to reach people at higher risk of HIV infection.\u201d \n \n Same-sex sexual acts are a crime in 76 countries, and in seven of those countries, the act can be punishable by death. Some 17 countries have laws that allow for the deportation of foreigners with HIV, and five countries in the Middle East do not allow entry to people with HIV. In a statement following the release of the UNAIDS report, Doctors Without Borders applauded the improvements in treatment but warned against complacency, saying the world \u201ccannot afford to lose any momentum.\u201d In some countries, HIV treatment coverage is as low as 17 percent, the organization said. \n \n \u201cWhen we see the situation in countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, or the Central African Republic, we feel like we are stuck in a time warp,\u201d Eric Goemaere, a Doctors Without Borders AIDS specialist, said at a conference last year. \u201cIn our projects, we receive patients at advanced stages of AIDS who remind us of what we saw before 2000 in southern Africa, when antiretroviral treatments were hardly available.\u201d \n \n Despite unprecedented growth in the past decade, the UNAIDS report also warned that more financial support for countries is desperately needed. To remain on track to end the epidemic by 2030, $8 billion to $12 billion will need to be spent on treatment programs annually through 2020. ||||| Charlie Sheen Exposing Sex Partners to HIV is a Crime \n \n EXCLUSIVE \n \n Charlie Sheen could have some big legal problems with the revelation he has HIV, because in California it's a crime for someone to have unprotected sex when that person knows he or she is infected with HIV. \n \n Charlie has not said if he's had unprotected sex, but as we previously reported we know he's settled several cases with people who were unaware of his HIV status and had sex with him. If he did have unprotected sex, under California law, he could get 6 months in jail. \n \n The law is clear ... anyone with a communicable disease who \"willfully exposes another person\" is guilty. There was a case this past March in which a San Diego man was convicted of the crime for willfully exposing his boyfriend to HIV. He was later sentenced to 6 months in jail. \n \n The stakes are higher if someone knows they have HIV and has sex with another person with the intent to transmit the disease ... then it's a felony punishable by a maximum of 8 years in prison. \n \n Law enforcement sources say no one has come forward yet complaining Charlie exposed them to HIV.",

It's a turning point in one's life,\" says Sheen. The diagnosis came while he was hospitalized for a series of severe headaches. The 50-year-old actor says he has paid big money to people over the last four years who have threatened to go public with his secret\u2014including a prostitute who once photographed his medication. \"I think I release myself from this prison today,\" he said. Sheen said it's \"impossible\" that he has transmitted HIV to anyone else. He also told Lauer that he has had unprotected sex with two people since the diagnosis, but both were aware of his status. (TMZ reports that he has settled lawsuits with people who had sex with him but were unaware of his HIV status.) He's not clear on how he contracted HIV, but he spoke of his out-of-control drinking and drug use of a few years ago. \"Bad decisions.\" Sheen's doctor also appeared on the show, and he said Sheen currently has \"undetectable\" levels of HIV in his body, thanks to medication.

But the differing interpretations of Mr. Obama\u2019s letter in Tehran and Washington are a reminder of the political hurdles and the legacy of mistrust that both sides will have to overcome in negotiating a deal. \n \n The American official said Mr. Obama had congratulated Mr. Rouhani on his election, and characterized the vote as an opportunity for change. But on sanctions, the official said, the Iranians were inferring relief from the president\u2019s more general pledge to resolve issues and move forward. And while Mr. Obama is open to direct talks, the official said, they will not necessarily be leader to leader. \n \n The Iranian reaction to the letter provides critical insight into a decisive and unexpected shift in strategy by the moderate new president as Iran struggles to restore vitality to its economy and undo years of hostile relations with most of the world under the former president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The overtures to the United States are part of a flurry of steps altering the trajectory of the Iranian state, including domestic liberalizations and returning the politically powerful military to the barracks \u2014 for now. Those actions, along with the changed diplomatic tone, have convinced some experts that the changes are more than cosmetic. \n \n Mr. Rouhani will present Iran\u2019s new face to world next week with an address to the United Nations General Assembly, an evening speech to the Council on Foreign Relations and the Asia Society, and a television interviews with Charlie Rose and CNN. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In an opinion essay published in The Washington Post on Friday, Mr. Rouhani said world leaders should \u201cseize the opportunity presented by Iran\u2019s recent election.\u201d \n \n \u201cI urge them to make the most of the mandate for prudent engagement that my people have given me and to respond genuinely to my government\u2019s efforts to engage in constructive dialogue,\u201d he wrote. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Skeptics were quick to point out that Mr. Obama has reached out to Iran before. Having promised as a candidate to extend an olive branch to old enemies, he sent a letter early in his first term to the country\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, proposing a new diplomatic chapter. In his reply, Ayatollah Khamenei did not take Mr. Obama up on his offer. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Their correspondence was cut short after Iran\u2019s disputed presidential election in June 2009 unleashed a popular uprising.

Mr. Rouhani said in an NBC News interview broadcast on Wednesday that the tone of Mr. Obama\u2019s letter was \u201cpositive and constructive.\u201d He added, \u201cIt could be subtle and tiny steps for a very important future.\u201d \n \n Mr. Obama, speaking to the Spanish-language network Telemundo on Tuesday, said there were indications that Mr. Rouhani \u201cis somebody who is looking to open dialogue with the West and with the United States, in a way that we haven\u2019t seen in the past.

Iranians embraced my approach to domestic and international affairs because they saw it as long overdue. I\u2019m committed to fulfilling my promises to my people, including my pledge to engage in constructive interaction with the world. \n \n The world has changed. International politics is no longer a zero-sum game but a multi-dimensional arena where cooperation and competition often occur simultaneously. Gone is the age of blood feuds. World leaders are expected to lead in turning threats into opportunities. \n \n The international community faces many challenges in this new world \u2014 terrorism, extremism, foreign military interference, drug trafficking, cybercrime and cultural encroachment \u2014 all within a framework that has emphasized hard power and the use of brute force. \n \n We must pay attention to the complexities of the issues at hand to solve them. Enter my definition of constructive engagement. In a world where global politics is no longer a zero-sum game, it is \u2014 or should be \u2014 counterintuitive to pursue one\u2019s interests without considering the interests of others. A constructive approach to diplomacy doesn\u2019t mean relinquishing one\u2019s rights. It means engaging with one\u2019s counterparts, on the basis of equal footing and mutual respect, to address shared concerns and achieve shared objectives. In other words, win-win outcomes are not just favorable but also achievable. A zero-sum, Cold War mentality leads to everyone\u2019s loss. \n \n 1 of 25 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The Right\u2019s 25 most influential, from Townhall.com View Photos The conservative website\u2019s latest listing of the most prominent voices on the right, with a few names you may not know.

Security is pursued at the expense of the insecurity of others, with disastrous consequences. More than a decade and two wars after 9/11, al-Qaeda and other militant extremists continue to wreak havoc. Syria, a jewel of civilization, has become the scene of heartbreaking violence, including chemical weapons attacks, which we strongly condemn. In Iraq, 10 years after the American-led invasion, dozens still lose their lives to violence every day. Afghanistan endures similar, endemic bloodshed. \n \n The unilateral approach, which glorifies brute force and breeds violence, is clearly incapable of solving issues we all face, such as terrorism and extremism. I say all because nobody is immune to extremist-fueled violence, even though it might rage thousands of miles away. Americans woke up to this reality 12 years ago. \n \n My approach to foreign policy seeks to resolve these issues by addressing their underlying causes. We must work together to end the unhealthy rivalries and interferences that fuel violence and drive us apart. We must also pay attention to the issue of identity as a key driver of tension in, and beyond, the Middle East. \n \n At their core, the vicious battles in Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria are over the nature of those countries\u2019 identities and their consequent roles in our region and the world. The centrality of identity extends to the case of our peaceful nuclear energy program. To us, mastering the atomic fuel cycle and generating nuclear power is as much about diversifying our energy resources as it is about who Iranians are as a nation, our demand for dignity and respect and our consequent place in the world. Without comprehending the role of identity, many issues we all face will remain unresolved. \n \n I am committed to confronting our common challenges via a two-pronged approach. \n \n First, we must join hands to constructively work toward national dialogue, whether in Syria or Bahrain. We must create an atmosphere where peoples of the region can decide their own fates. As part of this, I announce my government\u2019s readiness to help facilitate dialogue between the Syrian government and the opposition. \n \n Second, we must address the broader, overarching injustices and rivalries that fuel violence and tensions. A key aspect of my commitment to constructive interaction entails a sincere effort to engage with neighbors and other nations to identify and secure win-win solutions. \n \n 1 of 156 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 The best editorial cartoons of 2013 (so far) View Photos A collection of cartoons from around the country.

This is not unique to Iran\u2019s international relations. In a climate where much of foreign policy is a direct function of domestic politics, focusing on what one doesn\u2019t want is an easy way out of difficult conundrums for many world leaders. Expressing what one does want requires more courage. \n \n After 10 years of back-and-forth, what all sides don\u2019t want in relation to our nuclear file is clear. The same dynamic is evident in the rival approaches to Syria. \n \n This approach can be useful for efforts to prevent cold conflicts from turning hot. But to move beyond impasses, whether in relation to Syria, my country\u2019s nuclear program or its relations with the United States, we need to aim higher. Rather than focusing on how to prevent things from getting worse, we need to think \u2014 and talk \u2014 about how to make things better. To do that, we all need to muster the courage to start conveying what we want \u2014 clearly, concisely and sincerely \u2014 and to back it up with the political will to take necessary action. This is the essence of my approach to constructive interaction. \n \n As I depart for New York for the opening of the U.N. General Assembly, I urge my counterparts to seize the opportunity presented by Iran\u2019s recent election. I urge them to make the most of the mandate for prudent engagement that my people have given me and to respond genuinely to my government\u2019s efforts to engage in constructive dialogue. Most of all, I urge them to look beyond the pines and be brave enough to tell me what they see \u2014 if not for their national interests, then for the sake of their legacies, and our children and future generations. ||||| In this 2013 photo released by the official website of the office of the Iranian Presidency, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani speaks during an interview with state television in Tehran. Rouhani is set to address the U.N. on Tuesday. (Rouzbeh Jadidoleslam/AP) \n \n In the often colorless realm of international diplomacy, one annual ritual has stood out for years \u2014 a provocative speech by Iran\u2019s leader to the United Nations each September, followed by a walkout by U.S. and Israeli delegates. \n \n That bit of diplomatic theater may not happen this year, as a new Iranian president who has alternately pleased, intrigued and startled American observers makes his debut trip to the annual gathering of world leaders in New York. \n \n No one, including Obama administration officials, knows what might happen instead. \n \n Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and President Obama are set to address the world body on Tuesday, with the tantalizing prospect of a face-to-face meeting between the leaders of two nations so long poised as enemies. \n \n Rouhani\u2019s speech is expected to be the main event in nearly a week of interviews, think-tank talks and other appearances meant to showcase a newly moderate, approachable face of the Iranian government. The charm offensive included an op-ed by the Iranian leader in Friday\u2019s Washington Post. \n \n \u201cAs I depart for New York for the opening of the U.N. General Assembly, I urge my counterparts to seize the opportunity presented by Iran\u2019s recent election,\u201d Rouhani wrote in the op-ed. \u201cI urge them to make the most of the mandate for prudent engagement that my people have given me and to respond genuinely to my government\u2019s efforts to engage in constructive dialogue.\u201d \n \n U.S. officials say they have been encouraged by recent gestures from Rouhani, including the public discussion of his country\u2019s disputed nuclear program \u2014 the crux of Iran\u2019s standoff with the West. Obama has said he will do whatever it takes, including a military strike, to stop Iran from building a bomb. Rouhani said in a television interview this week that his country will never seek nuclear weapons. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s no question that the new Iranian government has been taking a different approach in the things that it has said about a lot of issues,\u201d White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday. \u201cIt has taken some actions that suggest a new approach.\u201d \n \n Carney and other U.S. officials, however, have been careful not to embrace Rouhani without reservations and have emphasized that Iran\u2019s stated desire to improve relations with the international community needs to be followed up with concrete steps. \n \n \u201cRouhani\u2019s comments are very positive, but everything needs to be put to the test, and we\u2019ll see where we go,\u201d Secretary of State John F. Kerry said Thursday. \n \n A contrast to Ahmadinejad \n \n The barrage of friendly Iranian gestures marks a U-turn away from the rhetoric of Rouhani\u2019s immediate predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who for a decade regularly denounced the United States and Israel and suggested that the Holocaust was a myth. \n \n If Obama is to make good on his 2008 campaign promise to explore the possibility of improved relations and a nuclear rapprochement with Iran, the U.N. meeting this year appears to be his best chance yet. \n \n Rouhani stunned many with a Rosh Hashanah greeting to Jews this month and announced Thursday that he will bring Iran\u2019s only Jewish member of parliament with him to New York. \n \n This week, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, signaled a willingness to begin negotiations on the nuclear issue. Iran also released several high-profile political prisoners. \n \n Carney said there is no meeting scheduled between Rouhani and Obama. But Rouhani has suggested that he is open to a meeting, which would be the first such contact since 1979, when the countries broke off relations after Iranian students stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. \n \n Rouhani told NBC News that he welcomed a letter of congratulations that Obama sent him last month. \u201cFrom my point of view, the tone of the letter was positive and constructive,\u201d Rouhani said through an interpreter. \n \n Since taking office last month, Rouhani and his U.S.-educated foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, have offered a unified vision of Iran\u2019s foreign policy agenda. That is in stark contrast to the hodgepodge of the Ahmadinejad years, when different centers of power competed for influence. \n \n Rouhani also appears to have the support of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, who has long been the ultimate arbiter of the country\u2019s nuclear decisions. \n \n That endorsement brings an air of authority to Rouhani\u2019s calls for increased openness toward the West, said Dennis Ross, a former senior adviser on the Middle East to the Obama White House. \n \n \u201cThe fact that the Iranians, including the supreme leader, are publicly indicating a readiness to talk means they are preparing the ground for such engagement,\u201d Ross said. \n \n High stakes for Iran, West \n \n Still, there is more at stake now, with Iran closer to the point at which it could build a bomb if it chose to do so and its economy wobbling under the weight of international sanctions imposed because of the nuclear dispute. \n \n Veterans of past negotiations with Iran said they fear that Rouhani\u2019s team may not yet grasp the kinds of concessions that the Islamic republic would be required to make to win relief from the most painful economic sanctions, such as restrictions on banking transactions and oil sales. Iranian officials have hinted at a willingness to accept minor limits on their nuclear program, which would not prevent a quick drive for a bomb. \n \n \u201cCharm alone is insufficient to achieve the kind of sanctions relief they\u2019re looking for,\u201d said Gary Samore, who until early this year was Obama\u2019s principal adviser on arms control and weapons of mass destruction. \u201cSo far I haven\u2019t seen the Iranians indicating a willingness to take the dramatic steps necessary to lift the biggest sanctions.\u201d \n \n Zarif, who is well known to U.S. officials as Iran\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations from 2002 to 2007, is already in New York. He hosted a closed-door luncheon for more than 100 U.N. diplomats on Thursday.

But Western diplomats and policy experts say the issues in contention are probably too complex for meetings on the sidelines of the U.N. conference. \n \n For now, Iranian hard-liners who have championed their country\u2019s nuclear capability appear to be sidelined, said Mohammad Ali Shabani, a Tehran political analyst. If Rouhani\u2019s overtures yield nothing, Shabani said, there will be a political and public backlash. \n \n \u201cRight now, this government\u2019s hands aren\u2019t tied, but that won\u2019t last forever.

    "document": "While Paul\u2019s views on Israel certainly place him outside the American, never mind Republican, mainstream, there is an even more elementary reason the RJC was right to exclude him from its event. It is Paul\u2019s lucrative and decades-long promotion of bigotry and conspiracy theories, for which he has yet to account fully, and his continuing espousal of extremist views, that should make him unwelcome at any respectable forum, not only those hosted by Jewish organizations. \n \n Paul\u2019s exclusion caused an uproar, with critics alleging that his stand on Israel had earned the RJC\u2019s ire; an absolutist libertarian, Paul opposes foreign aid to all countries, including the Jewish state. \u201cThis seems to me more of an attempt to draw boundaries around acceptable policy discourse than any active concern that President Dr. Ron Paul would be actively anti-Israel or anti-Semitic,\u201d wrote Reason editor Matt Welch. Chris McGreal of the Guardian reported that Paul \u201cwas barred because of his views on Israel.\u201d Even Seth Lipsky, editor of the New York Sun and a valiant defender of Israel (and friend and mentor of this writer), opined, \u201cThe whole idea of an organization of Jewish Republicans worrying about the mainstream strikes me as a bit contradictory.\u201d \n \n The Republican Jewish Coalition announced this month that congressman Ron Paul would not be among the six guests invited to participate in its Republican Presidential Candidates Forum. \u201cHe\u2019s just so far outside of the mainstream of the Republican party and this organization,\u201d said Matt Brooks, executive director of the RJC, adding that the group \u201crejects his misguided and extreme views.\u201d \n \n In January 2008, the New Republic ran my story reporting the contents of monthly newsletters that Paul published throughout the 1980s and 1990s. While a handful of controversial passages from these bulletins had been quoted previously, I was able to track down nearly the entire archive, scattered between the University of Kansas and the Wisconsin Historical Society (both of which housed the newsletters in collections of extreme right-wing American political literature). Though particular articles rarely carried a byline, the vast majority were written in the first person, while the title of the newsletter, in its various iterations, always featured Paul\u2019s name: Ron Paul\u2019s Freedom Report, the Ron Paul Political Report, the Ron Paul Survival Report, and the Ron Paul Investment Letter. What I found was unpleasant. \n \n \u201cOrder was only restored in L.A. when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks,\u201d read a typical article from the June 1992 \u201cSpecial Issue on Racial Terrorism,\u201d a supplement to the Ron Paul Political Report. Racial apocalypse was the most persistent theme of the newsletters; a 1990 issue warned of \u201cThe Coming Race War,\u201d and an article the following year about disturbances in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington, D.C., was entitled \u201cAnimals Take Over the D.C. Zoo.\u201d Paul alleged that Martin Luther King Jr., \u201cthe world-class philanderer who beat up his paramours,\u201d had also \u201cseduced underage girls and boys.\u201d The man who would later proclaim King a \u201chero\u201d attacked Ronald Reagan for signing legislation creating the federal holiday in his name, complaining, \u201cWe can thank him for our annual Hate Whitey Day.\u201d \n \n No conspiracy theory was too outlandish for Paul\u2019s endorsement. One newsletter reported on the heretofore unknown phenomenon of \u201cNeedlin\u2019,\u201d in which \u201cgangs of black girls between the ages of 12 and 14\u201d roamed the streets of New York and injected white women with possibly HIV-infected syringes. Another newsletter warned that \u201cthe AIDS patient\u201d should not be allowed to eat in restaurants because \u201cAIDS can be transmitted by saliva,\u201d a strange claim for a physician to make. \n \n Paul gave credence to the theory, later shown to have been the product of a Soviet disinformation effort, that AIDS had been created in a U.S. government laboratory at Fort Detrick, Maryland. Three months before far-right extremists killed 168 Americans in Oklahoma City, Paul\u2019s newsletter praised the \u201c1,500 local militias now training to defend liberty\u201d as \u201cone of the most encouraging developments in America.\u201d And he offered specific advice to antigovernment militia members, such as, \u201cKeep the group size down,\u201d \u201cKeep quiet and you\u2019re harder to find,\u201d \u201cLeave no clues,\u201d \u201cAvoid the phone as much as possible,\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to have a war, let it begin here.\u201d ||||| So as Ron Paul is on track to win the Iowa caucuses, he is getting a new dose of press scrutiny. \n \n And the press is focusing on the newsletters that went out under his name in the late 1980s and early 1990s. They were called the Ron Paul's Political Report, Ron Paul's Freedom Report, the Ron Paul Survival Report and the Ron Paul Investment Letter. \n \n There is no doubt that the newsletters contained utterly racist statements. \n \n Some choice quotes: \n \n \"Given the inefficiencies of what DC laughingly calls the criminal justice system, I think we can safely assume that 95 percent of the black males in that city are semi-criminal or entirely criminal.\" \n \n \"We are constantly told that it is evil to be afraid of black men, it is hardly irrational.\" \n \n After the Los Angeles riots, one article in a newsletter claimed, \"Order was only restored in L.A. when it came time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks.\" \n \n One referred to Martin Luther King Jr. as \"the world-class philanderer who beat up his paramours\" and who \"seduced underage girls and boys.\" \n \n Another referred to Barbara Jordan, a civil rights activist and congresswoman as \"Barbara Morondon,\" the \"archetypical half-educated victimologist.\" \n \n Other newsletters had strange conspiracy theories about homosexuals, the CIA, and AIDS. \n \n In 1996 when the Texas Monthly investigated the newsletters, Paul took responsibility for them and said that certain things were taken out of context. (It's hard to imagine a context that would make the above quotes defensible.) \n \n When the newsletter controversy came up again during the 2008 campaign, Paul explained that he didn't actually write the newsletters but because they carried his name he was morally responsible for their content. Further, he didn't know exactly who wrote the offensive things and they didn't represent his views. \n \n But it is still a serious issue. Journalists at the libertarian-leaning Reason reported that Paul made nearly one million dollars in just one year from publishing the newsletters. Could Paul really not understand the working of such a profitable operation? They were told by a source close to the Paul campaign that the author was likely longtime Paul-friend and combative polemicist Lew Rockwell. \n \n Even though many of the newsletters are written in a first person, conversational style, many observers don't believe that Ron Paul actually wrote them. \n \n There aren't any videos on YouTube with Paul speaking in incendiary terms about minorities. The newsletters don't \"sound\" like Ron Paul - he doesn't do wordplay like \"Morondon\" or use prefixes like \"semi-criminal\" or \"half-educated\" in his speech or his recent writings. Further, most newsletter and direct-mail operations in politics employ ghostwriters. \n \n So why were Ron Paul or his ghostwriters engaged in racism and conspiracy theories? And why did Ron Paul allow this? \n \n The first answer is simply that marginal causes attract marginal people. \n \n The Gold Standard and non-interventionism have long been pushed to the fringe of our politics, and ambitious people tend to dive into the mainstream. That means that some of the 'talent' that marginalized ideas attract will be odd and unstable. \n \n There are two strategies for dealing with this problem. You purge your movement of cranks to preserve credibility and risk alienating a chunk of supporters. Or you let everyone in your movement fly their freak flag and live with the consequences. Ron Paul, being a libertarian, has always done the latter. \n \n The second answer to this question: These newsletters were published before a decade of war that has exhausted many Americans, before the financial crisis, and before the Tea Party. \n \n All three made Ron Paul's ideas seem more relevant to our politics. They made anti-government libertarianism seem (to some) like a sensible corrective. \n \n But in the 1990s and 1980s, anti-government sentiment was much less mainstream. It seemed contained to the racist right-wing, people who supported militia movements, who obsessed over political correctness, who were suspicious of free-trade deals like NAFTA. \n \n At that time a libertarian theorist, Murray Rothbard argued that libertarians ought to engage in \"Outreach to the Rednecks\" in order to insert their libertarian theories into the middle of the nation's political passions. \n \n Rothbard had tremendous influence on Lew Rockwell, and the whole slice of the libertarian movement that adored Ron Paul. \n \n But Rothbard and Rockwell never stuck with their alliances with angry white men on the far right. They have been willing to shift alliances from left to right and back again. Before this \"outreach\" to racists, Rothbard aligned himself with anti-Vietnam war protestors in the 1960s. In the 2000s, after the \"outreach\" had failed, Rockwell complained bitterly about \"Red-State fascists\" who supported George Bush and his war. So much for the \"Rednecks.\" The anti-government theories stay the same, the political strategy shifts in odd and extreme directions. \n \n As crazy as it sounds, Ron Paul's newsletter writers may not have been sincerely racist at all. They actually thought appearing to be racist was a good political strategy in the 1990s. After that strategy yielded almost nothing - it was abandoned by Paul's admirers. \n \n You can attribute their \"redneck strategy\" to the most malignant kind of cynicism or to a political desperation that made them insane. Neither is particularly flattering. \n \n Phil Klein of the Washington Examiner is correct when he writes: \n \n Rick Perry and Mitt Romney have both attacked each other for what was written in their respective books. If either of those books had included a number of overtly racist statements, their candidacies would be over before they started. \n \n This is undoubtedly true. The media seems to simply accept that Ron Paul has some oddities in his past and in his inner circle. They take his grandfatherly demeanor at face-value. In part this is because they believe he is not a serious candidate. \n \n Winning the Iowa caucuses would change all that instantly. Undoubtedly the movement that Paul inspired has moved far beyond the race-baiting it engaged in two decades ago. Young people from college campuses aren't lining up to hear him speak because of what appeared in those newsletter about the 1992 L.A. riots. Rand Paul tried his hardest to place Paul-style libertarianism into the context of the Tea Party. And he will likely carry on the movement without this 1990s baggage. \n \n But the questions remain. If Ron Paul is so libertarian that he won't even police people who use his name, if his movement is filled with incompetents and opportunists, then what kind of a president would he make? Would he even check in to see if his ideas are being implemented? Who would he appoint to Cabinet positions? \n \n These are all legitimate questions. And the media is going to start asking them now. \n \n If there isn't already a \"ceiling\" on Ron Paul's support, widespread knowledge of the newsletters could build one quickly. ||||| Mr. Paul, who is a physician, had said his political persuasion as a libertarian precluded him from harboring such biased views because \u201cI don\u2019t see people in collective groups.\u201d \n \n On Monday, his deputy campaign manager, Dimitri Kesari, reiterated that Mr. Paul \u201cdid not write, edit or authorize\u201d the language. \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cHe totally disavows what was said and disagrees with it totally,\u201d Mr. Kesari said. \u201cThe only responsibility he takes is for not paying closer attention.\u201d \n \n Mr. Paul is the latest in a series of candidates whose quick improvement in polls has drawn new scrutiny of the more problematic portions of their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.

    "document": "AUSTIN\u2013The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that hospital-like structural requirements for Texas abortion clinics can go into effect, which will cause all but seven or eight clinics to shutter. \n \n This was the second challenge to the state\u2019s 2013 law that also banned abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, mandated physicians to have hospital admitting privileges and tightened regulations on abortion-inducing drugs. \n \n The structural requirements include specific room and doorway sizes, air sterilization systems, backup generators and blood supplies on hand. Abortion providers say the requirements are unnecessary and won\u2019t add to the safety of the procedure. \n \n In June of 2013, before the law passed, there were 40 abortion clinics in Texas. Now there are 17, only seven of which meet the building standards upheld by the court. Each of the remaining clinics are within the Austin, Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth and San Antonio metropolitan areas. \n \n The court made an exception for Whole Woman\u2019s Health in McAllen, which won\u2019t be required to meet all of the building requirements or gain admitting privileges for one doctor. \n \n The 5th Circuit earlier upheld the provisions requiring doctors at abortion clinics to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and the regulations that mandate where and when a woman can take abortion-causing pills. At the time, the court said the provision did not impose an \u201cundue burden\u201d on women because they were still within driving distance of clinics. \n \n \u201cNot since before Roe v. Wade has a law or court decision had the potential to devastate access to reproductive health care on such a sweeping scale,\u201d said Nancy Northup, CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued the state on behalf of several abortion clinics, in an emailed statement Tuesday. ||||| AUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 A federal appeals court upheld key parts of Texas's strict anti-abortion law on Tuesday, a decision that could leave as few as seven abortion clinics in the nation's second largest state. \n \n The decision by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upholds requirements that abortion clinics meet hospital-level operating standards, which owners of small clinics say demand millions of dollars in upgrades they can't afford and will leave many women hundreds of miles away from an abortion provider. But the court said abortion clinics failed to prove that the restrictions would unduly burden a \"large fraction\" of women. \n \n Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and other conservatives say the standards protect women's health. But abortion-rights supports say the law is a thinly veiled attempt to block access to abortions in Texas, and they promised to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, which temporarily sidelined the law last year. \n \n \"Not since before Roe v. Wade has a law or court decision had the potential to devastate access to reproductive health care on such a sweeping scale,\" said Nancy Northrop, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights. \n \n Texas will be able to start enforcing the restrictions in about three weeks unless the Supreme Court steps in and temporarily halts the decision, said Stephanie Toti, an attorney for the center. Only seven abortion facilities in Texas, including four operated by Planned Parenthood, meet the more robust requirements. \n \n The ruling, made by a three-judge panel, is the 5th Circuit's latest decision in a lawsuit challenging some of the toughest abortion restrictions in the country. \n \n The New Orleans-based court \u2014 considered one of the most conservative in the nation \u2014 allowed Texas to enforce the restrictions when abortion providers first sued in 2013, but the U.S. Supreme Court put the law on hold last year and ordered the 5th Circuit to reconsider. \n \n Texas currently has about 17 abortion providers, down from 40 clinics in 2012. That sharp decline began after the 5th Circuit upheld another part of the 2013 law that required doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. \n \n Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a strong supporter of the law, praised the court's latest ruling. \n \n \"Abortion practitioners should have no right to operate their businesses from sub-standard facilities and with doctors who lack admitting privileges at a hospital,\" Paxton said. \n \n Under the new restrictions, the only remaining abortion facilities in Texas would be in major cities. One exception would be in McAllen, near the Texas-Mexico border, which the 5th Circuit exempted from some restrictions \u2014 but Toti said even those exemptions are so limited that it may not be practical to keep that McAllen clinic open. \n \n But for women in El Paso, the closest abortion provider in Texas would require a 1,200-mile round trip to San Antonio, or they would have to cross the border into New Mexico. \n \n The appeals court found that option suitable, noting that a clinic was just across the border in Santa Teresa, New Mexico. The court also said abortion clinics failed to show that most women would be unconstitutionally burdened by the law. \n \n \"Although the nearest abortion facility in Texas is 550 miles away from El Paso, there is evidence that women in El Paso can travel the short distance to Santa Teresa to obtain an abortion and, indeed, the evidence is that many did just that,\" the court wrote in a 56-page opinion. \n \n Attorneys for the state dismissed opponents' arguments about women being burdened by fewer abortion facilities, saying that nearly 9 in 10 women in Texas would still live within 150 miles of a provider. \n \n A new slate of conservative leaders in Texas has vowed to continue stifling abortion-rights efforts. George P. Bush, the son of expected 2016 presidential hopeful Jeb Bush and nephew of former President George W. Bush, made an anti-abortion rally at the Capitol his first public event since being sworn in as land commissioner, along with Abbott's wife, Cecilia. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Paul J.

A woman in El Paso would have to make a 1,300-mile round trip to San Antonio or cross the border into Mexico, and the AP notes the court found the latter option OK. \"Although the nearest abortion facility in Texas is 550 miles away from El Paso, there is evidence that women in El Paso can travel the short distance to Santa Teresa (in Mexico) to obtain an abortion and, indeed, the evidence is that many did just that,\" the court wrote.",

Greg Abbott and other conservatives say the standards protect women's health. But abortion-rights supports say the law is a thinly veiled attempt to block access to abortions in Texas, and they promised to appeal to the US Supreme Court, which temporarily sidelined the law last year. \"Not since before Roe v.

As the investigation... (Associated Press) \n \n CINCINNATI (AP) \u2014 A coroner's report released Tuesday showed new details of vicious violence in the shooting deaths of eight members of a rural southern Ohio family, finding most victims were shot three to nine times each and some of them were bruised. Meanwhile, the hunt for whoever is responsible continued to expand, with more than 200 law enforcement officials involved. \n \n A 911 caller on Friday said the bodies of two people found in one home looked to be beaten up. Attorney General Mike DeWine has called the slayings a carefully planned and \"sophisticated operation\" carried out against eight members of the Rhoden family by one or more killers. \n \n The Hamilton County coroner said the victims \u2014 three women, four men and a 16-year-old boy \u2014 had wounds to their heads, torso and other parts of the body. Dr. Lakshmi Sammarco said one victim had a single wound, one had two wounds, and the rest had three or more. The report didn't specify which victim had which number of wounds. \n \n Some victims showed \"signs of soft tissue bruising,\" her report stated. Sammarco's office declined to discuss its findings, citing the ongoing investigation. Funeral arrangements for the victims hadn't yet been announced. \n \n Authorities haven't suggested a motive or suspects. DeWine has said there were marijuana-growing operations found at three of the four places where bodies were found in Pike County, a rural Appalachian Mountain region roughly 80 miles east of Cincinnati and Hamilton County. \n \n DeWine said Tuesday that investigators have received more than 300 tips and are still serving search warrants. He said 79 pieces of evidence have been sent to a state crime lab for testing and analysis, including for DNA and fingerprints. \n \n Ohio and Pike County authorities are leading the investigation, with help from some two dozen other agencies including other county sheriffs. The FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration are also offering assistance. \n \n A woman who called 911 on Friday morning to report finding two of the bodies said that she saw \"blood all over the house\" and that the two looked like they had been badly beaten. \n \n The victims are 40-year-old Christopher Rhoden Sr.; his ex-wife, 37-year-old Dana Rhoden; their three children, 16-year-old Christopher Rhoden Jr., 19-year-old Hanna Rhoden and 20-year-old Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden; Christopher Rhoden Sr.'s brother, 44-year-old Kenneth Rhoden; their cousin, 38-year-old Gary Rhoden, and 20-year-old Hannah Gilley, whose 6-month old son with Frankie was unharmed. \n \n Two other children, Hanna Rhoden's 4-day-old daughter and Frankie Rhoden's 3-year-old son, also were unharmed. \n \n Leonard Manley, father of Dana Rhoden, told The Cincinnati Enquirer that he first learned about the marijuana operations from news reports. Manley, 64, said he's sure his daughter couldn't have been involved in anything illegal. \n \n \"They are trying to drag my daughter through the mud, and I don't appreciate that,\" said Manley, whose three grandchildren \u2014 Dana's children \u2014 were also among the dead. \n \n Manley also found it suspicious that any assailants were able to get by his daughter's two dogs. \n \n \"Whoever done it knows the family,\" Manley said. \"There were two dogs there that would eat you up.\" \n \n DeWine said Monday there was also possible evidence of cockfighting at one of the properties, but he didn't know if it was relevant to the investigation. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Kantele Franko, Ann Sanner and Andrew Welsh-Huggins in Columbus and Lisa Cornwell in Cincinnati contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n This story has been corrected to show Hanna Rhoden's daughter was 4 days old, not 6 months. ||||| COLUMBUS, Ohio --Seven of eight relatives who were killed in their southern Ohio homes Friday had been shot multiple times, including one who was shot nine times, according to autopsy results released Tuesday. \n \n Some also had bruising, which matched a report from a 911 caller who said two appeared to have been beaten up. \n \n The Hamilton County coroner said the victims - three women, four men and a 16-year-old boy - had wounds to their heads, torso and other parts of the body. Dr. Lakshmi Sammarco's report said one victim had a single wound, one had two wounds, and the rest had three or more. The report didn't specify which victim had which number of wounds. \n \n Ohio's attorney general has called the deaths carefully planned slayings carried out at four locations in Piketon, a rural Appalachian Mountain region community. Mike DeWine has also said there were marijuana growing operations at three of the locations where bodies were found. \n \n Investigators are also looking at the possibility a Mexican drug cartel is behind the pre-planned execution of the family. \n \n A law enforcement source confirmed to CBS News that investigators found some 200 marijuana plants. They were inside an indoor grow operation that was found in some of the homes where the eight members of the Rhoden family were executed. \n \n The size of the operation, according to the source, indicates the marijuana was being grown for sale and not for personal use. \n \n \"There is a drug problem in most areas around here,\" said Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader. \n \n Law enforcement sources estimate that the street value of the marijuana plants is nearly half a million dollars. \n \n But Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, who is heading up the investigation, couldn't say with certainty whether that may have been a factor in the murders. \n \n \"We have no idea. I mean you know we're running those leads out, there's many different theories,\" DeWine said. \n \n DeWine said Tuesday that investigators have received more than 300 tips and are continuing to serve search warrants in an effort to identify the killer or killers. He said 79 pieces of evidence have been sent to a state crime lab for testing and analysis. \n \n Authorities have said members of the Rhoden family were targeted in the slayings. \n \n A woman who called 911 Friday morning to report finding two of the bodies said that she saw \"blood all over the house\" and that the two looked like they had been badly beaten. \n \n The victims are 40-year-old Christopher Rhoden Sr.; his ex-wife, Dana Rhoden; their three children, 16-year-old Christopher Rhoden Jr., 19-year-old Hanna Rhoden and 20-year-old Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden; Christopher Rhoden Sr.'s brother, 44-year-old Kenneth Rhoden; their cousin, 38-year-old Gary Rhoden; and 20-year-old Hannah Gilley, whose 6-month old son with Frankie was unharmed. Two other children, a 6-month-old and a 3-year-old, were also unharmed. \n \n Leonard Manley, father of Dana Rhoden, told the Cincinnati Enquirer that he first learned about the marijuana operations from news reports. Manley, 64, said he's sure his daughter couldn't have been involved in anything illegal. \n \n \"They are trying to drag my daughter through the mud, and I don't appreciate that,\" said Manley, whose three grandchildren - Dana's children - were also among the dead. \n \n Manley also noted that the assailant was able to get by his daughter's two dogs. \n \n \"Whoever done it knows the family,\" Manley said. \"There were two dogs there that would eat you up.\" \n \n Pike County Prosecutor Rob Junk told the Columbus Dispatch on Monday that the marijuana operations included a grow house sheltering hundreds of plants. \n \n \"It wasn't just somebody sitting pots in the window,\" Junk said. \n \n DeWine said Monday there was also possible evidence of cockfighting at one of the properties, but he didn't know what was relevant to the investigation. \n \n More than a dozen counselors, clergy and psychologists arrived at the local high school on Monday to help friends and neighbors cope with their grief as they remembered the victims as loyal and caring people. \n \n Dana Rhoden \"always wanted what was best for her kids,\" Scioto Valley Local School District Superintendent Todd Burkitt said. \n \n The youngest victim, Christopher Rhoden Jr., was a freshman at Piketon High School. \n \n \"He was the first one that if he thought that someone wasn't being treated fairly or felt like someone wasn't being treated appropriately, he would speak up about it,\" Burkitt said. \n \n Hanna and Frankie Rhoden also had attended the school. \n \n While authorities have not released any details about a motive, the attorney general's office did confirm Monday that one of the victims had received a threat via Facebook. Authorities didn't elaborate. \n \n A Cincinnati-area businessman offered a $25,000 reward for details leading to those responsible. ||||| Rumors swirling on the street far outnumbered any official information released Monday about last week's killing of eight members of one family in Pike County, yet the trickled-out details allowed a clearer picture of the Rhodens and the murder investigation now entering its fifth day. \n \n PIKETON, Ohio - Rumors swirling on the street far outnumbered any official information released Monday about last week's killing of eight members of one family in Pike County, yet the trickled-out details allowed a clearer picture of the Rhodens and the murder investigation now entering its fifth day. \n \n The Pike County prosecutor said for the first time that the marijuana operations discovered at three of the four Rhoden property crime scenes were far from a few illicit plants growing in somebody's backyard for recreational use. \n \n Prosecutor Rob Junk said that one of the marijuana grow sites was indoors, and there were several hundred plants found. \n \n \"It wasn't just somebody sitting pots in the window,\" he said. \n \n And the Ohio attorney general's office said that animals and structures on the property indicate that roosters were being bred there for cockfighting. \n \n >> Complete coverage \n \n >> Graphic: Rhoden family tree \n \n >> Video: Professor on call for citizens to arm themselves \n \n Yet Junk said law-enforcement had been familiar with the Rhodens only for other reasons. \"Altercations with people, that sort of thing,\" he said. \"Nothing like this.\" \n \n The dead who were found on Friday morning: Dana Rhoden, 37; Dana's ex-husband, Christopher Rhoden Sr., 40; their children, Christopher Rhoden Jr., 16, Hanna Rhoden, 19, and Clarence \"Frankie\" Rhoden, 20; Frankie's fiancee, Hannah Gilley, 20; Kenneth Rhoden, 44, who is Rhoden Sr.'s brother; and Gary Rhoden, 38, Rhoden Sr.'s cousin. \n \n The law-enforcement response into the investigation remains massive. No one has been arrested, and officials have not said that they have any particular suspects in mind. \n \n Also new on Monday, authorities said that all eight autopsies have been finished and that donations to help the family can be made through the Rhoden Memorial Fund at any Fifth Third Bank. No funeral arrangements have been announced. \n \n The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation, part of the Ohio attorney general's office, still has at least 35 special agents, crime-scene investigators and analysts in Piketon to assist Pike County Sheriff Charles Reader's office. \n \n \"This is unprecedented,\" Attorney General Mike DeWine said both of the ghastliness of the crime and the response to the investigation. \"I don't know that in the history of the BCI that we've tackled anything of this magnitude.\" \n \n In light of the drug operations, he said the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration are aware of the situation and have offered to help. \n \n No one has officially offered a motive, but speculation is running rampant about how the marijuana signals some connection to a Mexican drug cartel. That is largely fueled by the fact that in 2012, BCI agents - during their annual hunt for marijuana plants - found 1,200 plants growing on a Pike County hillside. They also found abandoned camps with evidence that Mexican nationals had stayed there. At the time, DeWine said he suspected the work of a cartel. \n \n Authorities have not publicly addressed such a connection with this investigation, but they have said the killings - with each victim shot in the head while sleeping - were sophisticated and well-planned and that the killers covered their tracks. \n \n Todd Burkitt is superintendent of Scioto Valley schools, and he knew all of Dana and Christopher Rhoden's children because they had gone to school there; Christopher Rhoden Jr. was a current student at Piketon High School. \n \n These are the worst days of his career, Burkitt said, because his community is so troubled. He said there wasn't much education happening inside the schools Monday but mostly just an outpouring of support and love. \n \n He said that word of the marijuana operation at the Rhoden property doesn't change the facts in front of him. \n \n \"You don't condone someone breaking the law, but we've had eight people murdered,\" Burkitt said. \"No accusations or circumstances can lessen the barbaric nature of what happened here. We are all just sad.\" \n \n A reward of $25,000 is being offered for information in the case.

Officials told NBC News on Tuesday that one of the grow operations was comprised of more than 100 marijuana plants, and the drugs were not for personal use by the grower. \n \n DeWine and Reader said Sunday that the county and the state as a whole have a \"drug problem.\" A 2011 report said that the drug trafficking threat in Ohio was on the rise. More than $6 million in marijuana was seized last year, and more than 550 plants were seized from Pike County.

Meanwhile, the hunt for whoever is responsible continued to expand, with more than 200 law enforcement officials involved. A 911 caller on Friday said the bodies of two people found in one home looked to be beaten up. The Hamilton County coroner said the victims\u2014three women, four men and a 16-year-old boy\u2014had wounds to their heads, torso, and other parts of the body.

The victims in the rampage in Peebles include 16-year-old Christopher Rhoden Jr., a member of his high school's football team, and his parents, Dana and Clarence Rhoden, along with three other members of their extended family, the AP reports \u2013 The murders of eight members of one family in Ohio on Friday were \"methodical, calculated, and targeted\" and the killers covered their tracks, authorities say. \"I don't know that in the history of the BCI that we've tackled anything of this magnitude,\" says Mike DeWine, Ohio's attorney general, per the Columbus Dispatch. The victims, all from the Rhoden family, were shot in the head \"in the middle of the night while they were sleeping,\" says DeWine. \"Each was shot multiple times.\" No arrests have been made in the case, which is \"unprecedent \u2013 The Rhoden family massacre in Pike County, Ohio, on Friday was \"pre-planned\" and \"execution-style,\" authorities say\u2014and some of the victims showed signs of struggle before they were killed, NBC News reports.

If one site gets hacked all the places that you use the same password get compromised - they are a big pain. \n \n \"In the modern world everyone has a mobile phone and there is internet connectivity everywhere. So, we should be able to use biometrics [instead] to authenticate ourselves.\" \n \n Compromised checks \n \n Mastercard is far from the only firm experimenting with facial scans as authentication tools. \n \n China's e-commerce giant Alibaba recently demoed a pay-with-your-face system of its own. \n \n And both Microsoft's Windows 10 and Google's Android operating systems already allow users to unlock devices by looking at their cameras. \n \n Image copyright Microsoft Image caption Microsoft's Windows Hello software can also use iris scans as a biometric test \n \n Security researchers have pointed out that both facial scans and fingerprint sensors can be compromised. \n \n Even so, Mastercard insists its other security mechanisms should be able to prevent or at least detect suspicious behaviour. \n \n In addition, it says the facial scans and fingerprint data will not be transmitted in a form that could be intercepted, stolen or used by scammers. \n \n Battling fraud \n \n Smart wallet systems including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay have already introduced consumers to the concept of using their fingerprints to authorise payments. \n \n Many Japanese bank ATMs also have a reader that scans the vein patterns beneath customers' fingers to let them withdraw cash. \n \n One expert said other biometric tests could soon become the norm. \n \n \"Having one or more required authentication factors tied to who you are rather than what you know is going to become critical,\" said Windsor Holden from the tech consultancy Juniper Research. \n \n \"The problem with online payments has always been that the card doesn't need to be present, hence the credit card companies have charged more for the transactions to cover the costs of fraud. \n \n \"If they can introduce a mechanism that makes the system more secure than merely asking for a password, then the hope would be that fraud levels decrease and the savings can be passed back onto merchants, and perhaps consumers too.\" \n \n Follow all the BBC's MWC coverage via the \"Mobile World Congress 2016\" tag in our news app. \n \n You can also keep track of our technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones and the rest of the team covering the Barcelona event via a dedicated Twitter list.",

He says people use terrible, easily hackable passwords. Biometrics, such as facial recognition and the also-debuting fingerprint authentication, could reduce fraud for online shoppers. MasterCard tested out \"selfie pay\" in the US and Netherlands and found 92% of test subjects liked it. CNBC reports it could make online shopping easier, as MasterCard found 53% of people forget their password at least once a week, leading a third of online shoppers to just give up on buying anything. The next step for MasterCard is using people's heartbeats to verify their identity. People's hearts create their own signature electric signal, and MaserCard is testing out a bracelet that monitors it continuously and sends that information to nearby devices to authenticate the user.

He did not disappoint. \n \n The actor-comic opened the 73rd annual Golden Globes by mocking Sean Penn, Caitlyn Jenner, Roman Polanski, Jennifer Lawrence, Jeffrey Tambor, Ben Affleck, and many more. \n \n Here is a rundown of the bluntly sarcastic four-time host\u2019s funniest and/or most offensive lines from the Beverly Hilton \u2014 including what Gervais said to Mel Gibson that was entirely bleeped by NBC: \n \n \u2014 \u201cYou disgusting, pill-popping, sexual deviant scum. I\u2019m going to do this monologue and then go into hiding. Not even Sean Penn will find me \u2026 snitch.\u201d \n \n \u2014 \u201cYou\u2019re global megastars with amazing talent. Most of you. Some of you just married well. You know who are you. We all do.\u201d \n \n \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s right that NBC should host this award show. They\u2019re the only network that\u2019s truly fair and impartial and that\u2019s because they\u2019re the only network with zero nominations. So \u2026 nothing in it for \u2018em tonight. They don\u2019t care, obviously.\u201d \n \n \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m going to be nice tonight. I\u2019ve changed \u2014 not as much as Bruce Jenner. Obviously. Now Caitlyn Jenner, of course. What a year she\u2019s had! She became a role model for trans-people everywhere, showing great bravery in breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn\u2019t do a lot for women drivers. But you can\u2019t have everything, can ya? Not at the same time.\u201d \n \n \u2014 \u201cOne publication said me hosting would mean some film stars would stay away for fear of being made fun of. As if film stars would stay away from a chance of getting a Golden Globe \u2014 particularly if their film company has already paid for it.\u201d \n \n \u2014 \u201cThe excellent Spotlight has been nominated. Yeah. The Catholic Church are furious about the film as it it exposes that 5 percent of all their priests have repeatedly molested children and been allowed to continue to work without punishment. Roman Polanski called it \u2018the best date movie ever.\u2019\u201d \n \n \u2014 \u201cJennifer Lawrence made the news when she demanded equal pay for women in Hollywood. She received overwhelming support from people everywhere. There were marches on the street with nurses and factory workers saying, \u2018How the hell can a 25-year-old live on $52 million?!\u2019\u201d \n \n \u2014 \u201cOf course woman should be paid the same as men for doing the same job. And I\u2019d like to say now, I\u2019m being paid exactly the same as [what Tina Fey and Amy Poehler received] last year. No, I know there were two of them, but it\u2019s not my fault if they want to share the money, is it? That\u2019s their stupid fault. It\u2019s funny because it\u2019s true.\u201d \n \n \u2014 \u201cThe Hollywood Foreign Press deemed The Martian a comedy and even nominated it. And hence, Matt Damon is here tonight. So that worked a treat, didn\u2019t it? To be fair, The Martian was a lot funnier than Pixels. But then again, so was Schindler\u2019s List.\u201c \n \n \u2014 \u201cAll-female remakes are the big thing. There\u2019s a female remake of Ghostbusters. There\u2019s going to be a female remake of Ocean\u2019s 11. And this is brilliant for the studios because they get guaranteed box office results and they don\u2019t have to spend too much money on the cast.\u201d \n \n \u2014 \u201cThe president of the Hollywood Foreign Press said if I say anything offensive, or crass, or resort to innuendo, he\u2019s going to personally come out here and \u2018pull me off.\u2019 So that\u2019s an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse. Yes, yes, that is the level \u2014 an old man pulling me off. Again. At least Jeffrey Tambor did it in a dress.\u201d \n \n \u2014 \u201cRemember if you do win tonight, no one cares about that award as much as you do. Don\u2019t get emotional, it\u2019s embarrassing. That award is, no offense, worthless. It\u2019s a bit of metal some nice old confused journalists wanted to give you in person so they could meet you and have a selfie with you, okay? That\u2019s all it is!\u201d \n \n \u2014 \u201cI won three Golden Globes myself \u2026 one I keep by the bed to \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter why, it\u2019s mine. I won it fair and square. It\u2019s just the right shape and size, it\u2019s nothing\u2026 yeah. To be clear: That was a joke about me shoving Golden Globes that I\u2019ve won up my ass.\u201d \n \n \u2014 On introducing presenter Matt Damon: \u201cHe\u2019s the only person Ben Affleck hasn\u2019t been unfaithful to.\u201d \n \n \u2014 On introducing Eva Longoria and America Ferrera: \u201cTwo people who your future president, Donald Trump, can\u2019t wait to deport.\u201d \n \n \u2014 On the films Joy and Trainwreck. \u201cNo, not the names of Charlie Sheen\u2019s favorite hookers.

Listen, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s embarrassing for both of us. I blame NBC for this terrible situation. Mel blames\u2026we know who Mel blames. Listen, I still feel a bit bad for it. Mel\u2019s forgotten all about it apparently, that\u2019s what drinking does. I want to say something nice about Mel before he comes out. So: I\u2019d rather have a drink with him in his hotel room tonight than with Bill Cosby.\u201d Then after Gibson came out on stage, Gervais asked him \u2014 and this was entirely bleeped by NBC: \u201cWhat the f\u2013k does \u2018sugar t-ts\u2019 even mean?\u2019\u201d \n \n RELATED: Full Globes winners list \n \n Before the ceremony, Gervais tweeted a shirtless photo of himself with a profane message warning that he would offend Hollywood on Sunday night.

As movie and television fanatics alike gear up for one of the most exciting award shows of the year, some might not be too familiar with this year\u2019s host, Ricky Gervais. Never fear \u2014 we have five fast facts for you right here! \n \n Unlike some award show hosts, Ricky Gervais, 54, isn\u2019t the most household name in America. But considering the British comedian has such a major role in the 2016 Golden Globes as the night\u2019s host, that could very well change! Despite the fact that he has hosted before, Golden Globe devotees might need to know a little more about who will be running the show on Jan. 10. Get to know Ricky below! \n \n 1. He has hosted the Golden Globes the most times. \n \n This year\u2019s Golden Globes will be Ricky\u2019s fourth time hosting, giving him a leg up on the three-time hosts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. He also served as the master of ceremonies in 2010, 2011, and 2012. Because of his crude jokes that often involve celebrities in the audience, his returns have always been deemed controversial. \n \n 2. He isn\u2019t afraid to throw shade \u2014 and Robert Downey Jr. isn\u2019t exactly a fan of it. \n \n Ricky is known for having a dark sense of humor as it is, but during his second Golden Globes hosting gig in 2011, he totally dissed Robert when introducing the actor. He listed off some of Robert\u2019s movies before making a pretty personal slam: \u201cHe has done all those films, but many of you in this room know him best from such facilities as the Betty Ford Clinic and Los Angeles County Jail.\u201d Even though Robert called him out for being \u201cmean-spirited,\u201d Ricky outwardly said he isn\u2019t sorry! \n \n 3. He used to be a pop star. \n \n Well, not quite. After attending college, Ricky attempted to start a career as a singer with a pop duo called Seona Dancing. Although the group landed a recording contract and released two singles, Ricky\u2019s pop career didn\u2019t last long as the group failed to gain much attention. \n \n Join Amazon Prime For Free \u2013 Thousands of Movies & Shows Anytime \n \n 4. He was the original Michael Scott from The Office. \n \n Ricky\u2019s acting career really took off after he starred in a UK series of the same name beginning in 2001, which actually inspired the American remake because of its success overseas.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Sunday night marked Ricky Gervais' fourth time hosting the Golden Globes\u2014more times than anyone else, even Tina Fey and Amy Poehler\u2014and he's also been the most controversial. Why stars and show producers have always been nervous: Gervais isn't \"afraid to throw shade,\" as Hollywood Life puts it (and a NSFW tweet he posted Sunday afternoon shows he wasn't exactly going in afraid to offend). So what came out of his mouth at this year's show? After showing up at the podium with a pint in hand and calling the audience a bunch of \"disgusting, pill-popping, sexual deviant scum,\" Ricky Gervais confessed he wanted to go into hiding after doing the monologue and that \"not even Sean Penn will find me. Snitch.\" He followed that up with a promise that he'd be nicer this time around, adding, \"I've changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.\" Gervais couldn't resist sneaking in some topical American humor. \"Eva Longoria and America Ferrera aren't just beautiful, talented actresses,\" he noted. \"They're also two people that your future president, Donald Trump, can't wait to deport.\" He stuck to his promise to \"bite the hand that feeds me. \"That award is, no offense, worthless,\" he told nominees. \"It's a bit of metal that some nice old confused journalists wanted to give you in person so they could meet you and have a selfie with you.\" Along those same lines, per Entertainment Weekly: \"It's right that NBC should host this award show. They're the only network that's truly fair and impartial and that's because they're the only network with zero nominations.\" \"He's been the only person Ben Affleck hasn't been unfaithful to,\" he said before calling Matt Damon to the stage, per the Telegraph. About women not getting paid as much as men in Hollywood: \"I'm being paid exactly the same as [what Tina Fey and Amy Poehler received] last year. No, I know there were two of them, but it's not my fault if they want to share the money, is it? That's their stupid fault.\" NBC bleeped out what Gervais said to Mel Gibson during their head-to-head, but EW says he noted: \"What the f--k does 'sugar t-ts' even mean?\"\u2014a phrase Gibson reportedly used during a 2006 arrest.

View complete Giant hogweed Control Methods (PDF, 500 KB) document. \n \n Giant hogweed can be controlled manually, mechanically, and with herbicides. In some cases, a giant hogweed infestation is best controlled using several different methods in combination or in succession - in other words, a two, three, or even four-pronged attack plan. The final part to any control method is to plant grasses or other vegetation to provide competition for giant hogweed and decrease soil erosion. \n \n In order for your control effort to be successful, you will have to ensure that no additional seeds are being introduced to the area. With no influx of seed and a few years of persistent control efforts, giant hogweed plants can be eradicated. \n \n Before beginning or performing giant hogweed control, be sure to carefully read and follow the Health Hazards & Safety Instructions (this page contains graphic photos)! \n \n Overall Giant Hogweed Control \n \n Prevent introduction into new areas Do not move soil contaminated with seed. If removal of contaminated soil is necessary, seedling emergence can be prevented by burying the soil to a minimum depth of 20 inches (50 cm) and covering it with clean soil Sowing and planting giant hogweed is PROHIBITED Since the dispersal of giant hogweed is almost entirely by seeds, it is very important to prevent the plant from setting seed Control new, smaller infestations first before the seed bank has a chance to establish \n \n \n \n Field technician root-cutting hogweed plants. Field technician root-cutting hogweed plants. \n \n Manual & Mechanical Control \n \n Methods include root cutting, flower head/seed head removal, cutting and mowing, and cut and cover. Except for root cutting, manual control will not cause immediate death of the plant. All other methods will need two to three treatments per year for several years to deplete the root reserves and kill the plants. All methods will need to occur for multiple years until no new plants grow from the seed bank. Monitor the site for at least three more years to make sure no new seedlings appear. \n \n a. Root cutting \n \n This method is ideal for a single plant or small infestations. We have found 400 plants to be a manageable amount for two people to control manually. \n \n Cut the taproot approximately six inches below ground level using a spade, shovel, or anything with a large sharp edge. In areas with erosion or on steep inclines (where additional soil may be covering the plant base), plants may need to be cut up to ten inches below the soil. \n \n \n \n If possible (for your safety), cut the plants before the leaves are very large. \n \n The cut part of the plants should be removed from the soil and left out to dry (safest for control person) or bagged and disposed of. \n \n If the plants do not die, cut them again when they regrow. \n \n When using the root-cutting method, another attack strategy is to apply herbicide to the cut root remaining in the soil to help ensure no part of the root grows back the following year. \n \n b. Hogweed flower head/seed head removal & safe disposal \n \n Cut off the flower heads after the seeds have formed but before they mature. This will prevent the plants from shedding the seeds and from forming new flowers on lower branches. \n \n \n \n Clear trash bags are the best for solarization (a method of using the heat from the sun to destroy the seed viability) but dark bags are suitable as well. \n \n Seal trash bags tightly. \n \n If sap has gotten on the outside of the bag, put it inside another trash bag so the outside is safe to handle. \n \n Place in a secure location where they will be exposed to direct sunlight to give flowers and seeds solarization for at least two weeks. \n \n Dispose of trash bags in the garbage. \n \n c. Cutting & mowing \n \n Start when plants are small and continue mowing throughout season. DO NOT mow if the plants are larger than your mower and NEVER mow if there is a flower or seed head. \n \n If you choose to use this method, the plants must be cut at least three times during a growing season for several years. \n \n Repeated mowing is often used for large infested areas and if done consistently and on a regular basis can destroy most of the plants. \n \n Be careful not to spread the seeds - all flower heads should be removed and carefully disposed of prior to mowing. \n \n Mowing equipment should be cleaned before using in another area to avoid spreading hogweed seeds. \n \n d. Cut & cover \n \n Cut the plants down to ground level and cover the soil with black plastic or landscape fabric with mulch on top. \n \n Check the following year to make sure seedlings do not poke through. \n \n After a few years, remove the plastic and re-vegetate the area. \n \n Herbicide Control \n \n Giant hogweed is susceptible to systemic herbicides, such as glyphosate and triclopyr. The application of these herbicides is considered effective and cost efficient and can be used for the control of a single plant or large stands of giant hogweed. These systemic herbicides will be absorbed by the leaves and will move into the root to prevent regrowth the following year. Triclopyr is a selective herbicide that acts only on broadleaf plants and will not harm grasses in the area. Glyphosate is non persistent in the soil but is also a non-selective herbicide and will kill any surrounding vegetation it comes in contact with. Some triclopyr and glyphosate products (example: Rodeo) are labeled for use in riparian areas and near water. Areas sprayed with triclopyr can recolonize with grasses and other herbaceous species within the same growing season which helps to suppress giant hogweed seedling growth and decrease soil erosion. Recolonization at sites using glyphosate will probably be slower than sites using triclopyr unless re-seeded. \n \n Spray giant hogweed leaves with an herbicide containing triclopyr or glyphosate as the active ingredient. Use the recommended manufacturer's dose and follow label instructions - there is no advantage to using a higher dose. Apply the herbicide between March and early June when hogweed leaves are green and actively growing. A follow-up treatment, in July or August, may be needed for the plants that did not die from the first herbicide application. During this follow-up treatment it is strongly recommended to remove any flower heads present to decrease next year's seed source. It is easiest to spray before the plants grow overly tall. Giant hogweed plants can be sprayed later in the season as long as they are still green and not dying back. Another option is to carefully cut the plants above waist height and spray below. To be successful in eradicating giant hogweed, herbicide treatments (or another control method) will have to be repeated for a few years, in order to kill the plants missed the prior year as well as the plants emerging from the seed bank. \n \n Spray during dry and calm weather. Cover leaf surfaces thoroughly with spray droplets, but do not spray to the point that liquid is dripping off the leaves. Do not apply herbicide to non-target organisms as you want the other plants to live and revegetate the area. It may take plants treated up to one week or more depending on moisture levels before symptoms appear. Do not cut or dig the plant until the top growth has died back. If the leaves remain green several weeks or a month after the initial treatment, spray them with herbicide again. \n \n For Licensed Pesticide Applicators \n \n There are five herbicides that are legal for specific use on giant hogweed due to FIFRA 2(ee) Recommendations: \n \n Accord XRT II, EPA Reg. No. 62719-556 \n \n Garlon 4 Ultra, EPA Reg. No. 62719-527 \n \n Rodeo, EPA Reg. No. 62719-324 \n \n Roundup ProMax Herbicide, EPA Reg. No. 524-579 \n \n Roundup Pro Concentrate Herbicide, EPA Reg. No. 524-529 \n \n Some of these herbicides are classified as restricted and can only be applied by, or under the supervision of, a certified commercial pesticide applicator. A copy of the FIFRA 2(ee) Recommendation letter as well as a copy of the herbicide label needs to be carried by the applicator when applying herbicides. The 2(ee) recommendations can be downloaded at the NYS Pesticide Product, Ingredient and Manufacturer System (PIMS) database web site (leaves DEC website). \n \n It may be possible for hogweed seeds to remain viable in the soil for 15 years. For this reason, long-term monitoring is very important. Check the site and surrounding areas for the next several years for the emergence of any hogweed seedlings or regrowth from previous year's plants. \n \n This step is crucial! After removing giant hogweed plants, you may be left with an area of bare soil vulnerable to soil erosion, giant hogweed seedlings, and introduction of other invasive weeds. Re-establishment of native or non-invasive vegetation (e.g. through sowing grass mixtures) at treated sites may be necessary to help achieve your desired control outcome. This will help to reduce soil erosion and provide competition for giant hogweed seedlings. \n \n For more information about control of giant hogweed, please see The Best Management Practice Manual (PDF, 2.5 MB). This manual was developed by numerous experts in Europe to control this invasive plant. \n \n \n \n ||||| Officials in Virginia are warning residents to be on the lookout after an invasive plant was found Tuesday in the northern part of the state that can cause third-degree burns and even permanent blindness. \n \n The Massey Herbarium at Virginia Tech said in a Facebook post that 30 giant hogweed plants were discovered in Clarke County, located between Winchester and Leesburg. \n \n The plant contains a very toxic sap, that when combined with sun exposure, can cause severe health hazards. \n \n \"In brief, the sap prevents your skin from protecting itself from sunlight, which leads to a very bad sunburn,\" according to the New York Department of Environmental Conservation. \"Heat and moisture (sweat or dew) can worsen the skin reaction. The phototoxic reaction can begin as soon as 15 minutes after contact, with sensitivity peak between 30 minutes and two hours after contact.\" \n \n The sap can cause painful blisters that can form and become \"dark and pigmented,\" and scars that can last up to six years, according to the NYDEC. \n \n WARNING: GRAPHIC PHOTOS BELOW \n \n If the sap gets into the eye, it can even lead to blindness. \n \n Environmental officials in Virginia said that while there has just been one confirmed case in Clarke County, they are warning residents in other parts of the state to stay alert for potential sightings. \n \n \"There have been reports from VDOT of sightings of Giant Hogweed in the Staunton area and Middlesex County,\" Isle of Wight County posted to Facebook. \"There is a strong possibility that the Giant Hogweed could find its way into the Tidewater/Coastal Virginia area.\" \n \n Besides being a threat to humans, giant hogweed can also impact the environment. The plant can grow up to up to 14 feet, creating a lot of shade in the area and inhibiting the growth of native species. The plants have hollow stems that are generally 2 to 4 inches in diameter, with dark purple and red raised spots and bristle-like hairs. \n \n Environmental officials say that if you want to remove the plant, do not use a weed-whacker, because the plant's sap can splatter and then spread quickly. Eradication should be done by physical removal or using herbicides such as glyphosate or triclopyr, according to the NYDEC. \n \n \"It may be possible for hogweed seeds to remain viable in the soil for 15 years,\" the agency said. \"For this reason, long-term monitoring is very important. Check the site and surrounding areas for the next several years for the emergence of any hogweed seedlings or regrowth from previous year's plants.\" ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Its sap causes severe burns. One plant was found in Clarke County. Report sightings to your extension agent!

Of course, going anywhere near a giant hogweed requires protective gear. \n \n Weirdly enough, H. mantegazzianum isn't even the only horror weed that's come to plague the world from its Caucasus origins. \n \n The closely related H. sosnowskyi species, discovered in Georgia in the 1930s, was brought into the Soviet Union for growing as cattle feed. These days, it is by far the scariest plant you could find in the Baltic States and Poland, where it's considered highly invasive. \n \n It's easy to imagine that one day far in the future, when humans are all dead, whole swathes of our planet could be overgrown with this incredibly toxic, fast-growing plant. Movie writers, you're welcome. \n \n To learn about the identification of giant hogweed and compare it to common look-alikes, check out the NYDEC site here. ||||| Skip to main navigation \n \n Health Hazards & Safety Instructions for Giant Hogweed (with graphic photos) \n \n When giant hogweed (GH) sap, which contains photosensitizing furanocoumarins, contacts human skin in conjunction with sunlight, it can cause phytophotodermatitis - a serious skin inflammation. In brief, the sap prevents your skin from protecting itself from sunlight which leads to a very bad sunburn. Heat and moisture (sweat or dew) can worsen the skin reaction. The phototoxic reaction can begin as soon as 15 minutes after contact, with sensitivity peak between 30 minutes and two hours after contact. \n \n Photo of giant hogweed burn - 5 days to 5 months after initial exposure Photo credit: Bob Kleinberg \n \n What are the symptoms of exposure to giant hogweed sap? \n \n Painful blisters that form within 48 hours and become dark and pigmented \n \n Scars that last up to six years, though typically only last a few months \n \n Long-term sensitivity to sunlight is common \n \n Blindness may occur if the sap gets into the eye \n \n Where is the toxic sap located? \n \n Sap can be located in all parts of the plant but the following have higher concentrations: the lower part of the hollow stems and petioles; the hollow hairs on the plant; the foliage, stem, flower, or fruit (seed). \n \n Safety precautions to follow when controlling giant hogweed plants: \n \n Refer to the How to Control GH webpage which includes a detailed guide \n \n Do not touch the plant with bare skin \n \n Do not touch your bare skin with sap covered gloves \n \n Prevent UV sunlight from reaching skin by: \n \n wearing long waterproof gloves, long sleeves, pants, boots, and eye protection; synthetic water-resistant materials are best since cotton and linen fibers can soak up the plant sap and be penetrated by plant hairs If controlling plants with multiple people, keep a good distance from one another as the sap can splash three to four feet Apply sun block before beginning to work \n \n Launder clothes that may have contacted plants \n \n Wash equipment with water immediately after use \n \n Limit exposure to sunlight after control OR work around giant hogweed plants after sunset \n \n DO NOT use a \"weed-whacker\" or brush cutter - sap may splatter as stems are cut \n \n Keep water, soap, and eye-wash near work area in case of exposure \n \n What should you do if you are exposed to giant hogweed sap? \n \n Wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and COLD water as soon as possible \n \n Keep exposed area away from sunlight for 48 hours \n \n If a reaction occurs, topical steroids applied early can reduce the severity of the reaction and ease discomfort \n \n If sap goes in eyes, rinse them with water and wear sunglasses \n \n If a reaction has occurred, the area of skin may be sensitive to sunlight for a few years and you may want to apply sun block or keep the affected area covered from the sun when possible \n \n See a physician if you have a reaction or any questions \n \n \n \n",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 What ScienceAlert calls a \"giant horror plant\" has made its way to yet another US state, and people who come in contact with it could feel the pain. Virginia Tech's Massey Herbarium tweeted last week it had IDed a giant hogweed (aka Heracleum mantegazzianum) plant in Clarke County, later updating that count on Facebook to 30 plants. The plant holds what Fox News deems a \"toxic sap,\" which prevents human skin from protecting itself from the sun's rays, leading to severe burns that can be worsened by sweat. New York state's Department of Environmental Conservation lists other hazards that can result from coming in contact with the plant (as well as some photos of terrible burns), including long-term sunlight sensitivity, oozing blisters, scarring, and even permanent blindness if the sap makes its way into one's eyes. And it doesn't take a lot to fall prey to the poison of the giant hogweed, which resembles an umbrella or mushroom made up of white flowers: A simple brush up against its bristles can spur a reaction as soon as 15 minutes later, with \"sensitivity peak between 30 minutes and two hours after contact,\" per the DEC. It's difficult to stop the spreading of the invasive plant, which is native to the Caucasus region near Russia and was introduced to the US sometime in the early 20th century. Virginia environmental officials are warning the plant may have been spotted in other parts of the state and for people who come across it to not let their bare skin make contact. It also offers a guide for very carefully getting rid of the plant. (Giant hogweed has been found in at least a dozen other states.)",

After realizing their error, Beatty, 79, explained to the audience and viewers at home, \"I opened the envelope and it said, 'Emma Stone, La La Land.'

So far, there\u2019s never been a problem.\u201d \n \n Cullinan was standing stage right during the ceremony holding a briefcase that contained the 24 envelopes of the winners. His PWC partner, Martha Ruiz, was stage left holding another briefcase with an identical set of envelopes. The pair would take turns handing them out to presenters as they alternately took the stage from either side. \n \n For the final award \u2014 Best Picture \u2014 presenter Warren Beatty entered from stage right, Cullinan\u2019s side. \n \n Only Beatty was given the wrong envelope, a monumental flub that led to the incorrect winner being named. \n \n Before the glaring glitch, Cullinan had posted scores of photos taken backstage at the Oscars. \n \n After his bosses at PWC issued a mea culpa for the company\u2019s mistake, all of his Oscar night tweets were scrubbed. ||||| Accountant Brian Cullinan was told not to use social media during the Oscars \u2014 despite tweeting a photo of Emma Stone just moments before handing Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway the wrong envelope for Best Picture, PEOPLE has confirmed. \n \n In the now-deleted tweet, Cullinan \u2013 one of two accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers who handled the Oscars balloting \u2013 shared a photo of the Best Actress winner smiling while holding her award backstage. The time stamp shows it was posted at 9:05 p.m., only minutes before the Best Picture blunder occurred. \n \n \u201cBrian was asked not to tweet or use social media during the show,\u201d a source tells PEOPLE. \u201cHe was fine to tweet before he arrived at the red carpet but once he was under the auspices of the Oscar night job, that was to be his only focus.\u201d \n \n The source continued, \u201cTweeting right before the Best Picture category was announced was not something that should have happened.\u201d \n \n The source added that it\u2019s unclear whether the Academy will end its 83-year relationship with the accounting firm after the mix-up. \n \n \u201cThe Academy has launched a full-scale review of its relationship with PwC but it is very complicated,\u201d the source said. \u201cVote-tallying and the Oscar night job is just one part of what PwC does with the Academy. It is too early to say how this will play out but everyone is of course taking it very very seriously.\u201d \n \n Christopher Polk/Getty \n \n Cullinan has not publicly commented or posted on his Twitter account since the blunder, although his PwC partner Martha Ruiz shared a selfie from the red carpet with Cullinan and Michael Strahan after the accounting firm took responsibility for the error. \n \n PwC, the accounting firm that counts and delivers the winning Oscars envelopes, has publicly taken the blame for the incident in which La La Land was called as the Best Picture winner over the actual honoree, Moonlight. It confirmed that Cullinan mistakenly handed the presenters the duplicate Best Actress envelope instead of the Best Picture. \n \n Cullinan and Martha Ruiz were the representatives from PwC tasked with figuring out the Oscar winners and bringing the sealed envelopes containing the well-guarded secrets to the awards show. Two PwC staffers previously told MarketWatch that for security, there are \u201ctwo briefcases, that are identical, and we have two entire sets of winning envelopes.\u201d \n \n During the show, the two take their places on opposite sides of the stage, handing presenters their cards (depending on which side they enter from). \n \n On top of admitting fault in the error, PwC also said that Cullinan and Ruiz did not follow protocol for correcting the error \u201cquickly enough.\u201d They only appeared onstage after multiple La La Land creators gave speeches \u2013 more than two minutes after La La Land was incorrectly named the winner. \n \n Ahead of the show, both Ruiz and Cullinan seemed assured that no mistake of that kind would be made. \n \n Cullinan told The Huffington Post before the ceremony that if a wrong winner were to be called, \u201cWe would make sure that the correct person was known very quickly. Whether that entails stopping the show, us walking onstage, us signaling to the stage manager \u2014 that\u2019s really a game-time decision, if something like that were to happen. \u201d \n \n He added, \u201cAgain, it\u2019s so unlikely.\u201d ||||| The PriceWaterhouseCoopers auditors responsible for the biggest fiasco in Oscars history had previously boasted that their 83-year-old contract had never come up for tender because they \"always\" do a good job, it has emerged. \n \n Brian Cullinan, one of the only two people in the world supposed to know the Oscar winners before the ceremony, had said: \u201cIt\u2019s such a long-term relationship that we know intricately how everything works, the timing of it, the process that we use, and they have absolute trust in us and what we do.\u201d \n \n But that relationship could be in doubt for the first time today, after executives were seen in crisis meetings following an on-stage catastrophe in which La La Land was mistakenly... ||||| As of mid-Tuesday, officials at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were still reviewing Sunday night\u2019s Oscar debacle, when La La Land was mistakenly announced as Best Picture instead of Moonlight, and they were still considering possible fixes. An Academy spokeswoman declined to discuss the next steps. But people briefed on the matter dropped some hints. One change, according to a person familiar with the discussions, would involve stationing two auditors \u2014 from PricewaterhouseCoopers or otherwise \u2014 at each stage entrance, rather than one on each side, as was done until now. \n \n The extra auditor would act as a fail-safe, presumably keeping anyone from handing presenters the wrong envelope, as happened to Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway on Sunday. According to this person, the present two-auditor system \u2014 under which each holds a duplicate set of envelopes on each side of the stage \u2014 is designed not so much for safety as convenience: Presenters may enter from left or right, and the idea has been to have envelopes available on both sides. \n \n Another person said Academy officials are looking hard at the Emma Stone tweet posted by PwC auditor Brian Cullinan just before Dunaway announced the wrong winner onstage. The review, which has been a nonstop process since Sunday night, should make clear whether there was indeed a policy violation, and, if so, what might be done about it. \n \n Increasingly, Sunday\u2019s last-minute breakdown looks like a compound fracture. An auditor handed off the wrong envelope. Beatty mulled it, then passed it to Dunaway, who proclaimed La La Land the winner without accounting for the announcement\u2019s mention of best actress Stone. Those involved conferred while the announcement and mistaken thank-yous proceeded. No producer halted the process by stepping on-camera or having someone in the booth call a halt. The host, Jimmy Kimmel, was not immediately available to intervene; he was prepping a last-minute coda involving his faux nemesis Matt Damon. In the end, no one looked good.",

One change being considered is stationing two auditors at each stage entrance, rather than one on each side, as was done until now. The extra auditor would act as a fail-safe, presumably keeping anyone from handing presenters the wrong envelope, as happened to Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway on Sunday. Another person said Academy officials are looking hard at the Emma Stone tweet posted by PwC auditor Brian Cullinan just before Dunaway announced the wrong winner onstage. The review, which has been a nonstop process since Sunday night, should make clear whether there was indeed a policy violation, and, if so, what might be done about it. Increasingly, Sunday's last-minute breakdown looks like a compound fracture.",

(Photo courtesy Rhonda Thill) \n \n Rhonda Thill holds her husband Randy's wedding ring Thursday at her St. Paul home. She thought the ring was lost after Randy was killed in a motorcycle accident in June. (Pioneer Press: John Autey) \n \n About a dozen bikers in leather and denim were crawling aroundin the median this weekend on U.S. 61 in St. Paul. \n \n They were trying to mend a broken heart. \n \n The broken heart belongs to Rhonda Thill, a St. Paul woman who lost her love, her husband and the father of her three children, in a motorcycle accident three weeks ago. \n \n She couldn't bear to lose his wedding ring, too. \n \n But the ring wasn't among the personal effects she got from authorities after Randy Thill's fatal accident. Thill, 47, died about 1 a.m. June 25 after losing control of his Harley-Davidson and hitting the U.S. 61 median about a half-mile south of Warner Road. \n \n He died at the scene. \n \n Rhonda Thill knew his gold band must be there. It was a little loose on his finger, but he wore it every day for nearly 19 years. \n \n Someone would have to go there, to the spot where he died, and find it. \n \n \"I wanted to go, but I can't,\" she said this week. \"I'm not ready to see it yet.\" \n \n A friend called the State Patrol for her and explained the situation. A trooper went back to the scene to look for the ring but couldn't find it. \n \n A few friends made plans to search on the Saturday after the accident, but a thunderstorm kept them away. \n \n Her father and brother went out with a metal detector, but they came up empty, too. \n \n Thill was despondent. She turned to a high school friend who knew someone at the towing company that picked up her husband's Harley. They still had the bike, so she asked if he could at least bring her the guardian ride bell from her husband's motorcycle. \n \n He did, but it wasn't enough. \n \n \"She called me up crying and said 'I really want that ring back. I don't know what it's going to take,' \" said Tim Allen, her high school friend. \n \n Allen, vice president of Los Valientes motorcycle club, wanted to help. Randy Thill, a technician at Medtronic, got his motorcycle a couple of years ago, and the Thills had grown close to Allen and his girlfriend during their rides. \n \n \"I said I'd round up some friends,\" Allen said. \n \n Allen called up his friend at Rapid Recovery, the towing company that had Randy Thill's Harley. He asked if he could get the driver who picked up the bike to show them exactly where the accident was and maybe block a lane of traffic with a tow truck while they searched. \n \n His friend, Jay Stevens, did more than that. He's vice president of another motorcycle club called Sober Soldiers, a group for bikers who don't drink. \n \n Not only did he arrange for the tow truck and driver, he also brought along most of his motorcycle club to help search. \n \n \"We didn't know if we'd find it,\" Stevens said. \"We just wanted to give her some closure. \n \n Jay Stevens of the Sober Soldiers motorcycle club holds Randy Thill's wedding ring on his pointer finger after finding it Sunday, July 12, in the Highway 61 median in St. Paul. Tim Allen of Los Valientes motorcycle club, right, organized the search. (Photo courtesy of Emi Yokose) \n \n Allen, his girlfriend, Emi Yokose, a couple of Los Valientes members and about a dozen Sober Soldiers followed the tow truck to the scene of the crash. \n \n They started searching a 100-foot stretch of road, some with metal detectors, others on their hands and knees. \n \n Someone spotted the rubber gloves the paramedics left behind. \n \n That was where Thill died. \n \n Stevens focused his search in that spot, in the tall grass of the median just over the cable barrier. \n \n Allen watched him while he did his own digging nearby. \n \n \"He was persistent, looking where the body was,\" Allen said. \"All of a sudden, he jumped up and said 'I found the ... thing!' \" \n \n Stevens said the ring was pushed into the soil behind a weed. He said he pushed the weed aside and there it was. \n \n \"It looked like a bit of gold in the ground,\" Stevens said. \n \n The whole group went back to Rhonda Thill's house on the East Side. \n \n Allen and his girlfriend walked up to Thill. They handed her a flashlight and a pair of glasses they found in the median. They belonged to her husband, but they weren't what she was looking for. \n \n \"She held her head down,\" Allen said. \"Then I held up my pinky with the ring on it and said, 'And I got this.' \n \n \"We had to hold her up. She was about to fall over.\" \n \n Thill said it was amazing that a group of people she mostly didn't know would go to such trouble to help when Allen asked. \n \n \"He just had to make a call,\" she said. \"All those people have such kind hearts. They didn't hesitate.\" \n \n Jaime DeLage can be reached at 651-228-5450.

Sign up for our newsletter and other special offers: sign me up Thank you for signing up! \n \n It was the story that made every parent wince. Ralph and Marcella Bracamonte hired Diane Stretton as a live-in nanny to watch their children, ages 11, 4 and 16 months. When things didn't work out, they let her go. But, according to the Bracamontes, the 64-year-old nanny refused to leave their home in Upland, California.Since the story became national news on Friday, Stretton, who has refused to speak to media, hasn't returned to the house. She has been spotted driving past the house by the assembled media and her belongings remain in her room.But now, the Bracamontes say that Stretton has agreed to move out by July 4, under certain conditions. \"She wrote a [email] stating what she wants to do,\" Marcella Bracamonte tells PEOPLE. \"She would like to move out but because of the hot weather that's going to happen soon.\" The only hitch: the Bracamontes were scheduled to go out of town for a family wedding on July 2. \"I feel like it's a trap,\" says Bracamonte, adding that the couple will have other family members house-sitting while they're out of town. \"I feel like she knows that I'm going to be gone and that she wants to lock me out of my home.\"While Stretton and the Bracamontes come up with a solution, the case raises some burning questions. Speaking to PEOPLE inside their home, the Bracamontes answered some of them.The family had posted an ad on Craigslist, and Stretton seemed like a promising candidate. But did they do a criminal background check before hiring her? \"Of course I did,\" Marcella Bracamonte tells PEOPLE. \"I'm a mom. My family is the most important thing, so of course I did. I called references. I didn't do a credit check, because I wasn't accepting money from her. I just didn't think it was necessary. I was too trusting.\"According to the Bracamontes, they were initially pleased with Stretton's work \u2013 until the third week. \"She began slowing down,\" says Bracamonte. \"I thought maybe it was because she was a little older, but then things got worse the next week. And the next week.\" Adds Ralph Bracamonte: \"She didn't want to pick up anything anymore. She didn't want to help out.\"Because the employment agreement included a place to live, the family must go through the proper legal channels to evict her. \"The eviction process is a civil action and, in some cases, can take months to complete,\" says Cindy Bachman, a spokesperson for the San Bernardino County Sheriff. \"Once the process is complete, a deputy will remove the tenant and lock them out. If the tenant refuses to leave, they could face arrest for trespassing and/or violation of a court order.\"If they interfere with the nanny's room, the Bracamontes could face legal repercussions. \"She came in as a nanny in exchange for services,\" says the Bracamontes' attorney, Marc Cohen. (The laws regarding the housing agreement are different than those governing the employment arrangement.) \"She was given a room. She has a legal right to that room. I don't think there is a legal obligation to feed her. There would be a legal obligation to ensure that she has lights, running water, things like that.\"Under landlord/tenant laws, the Bracamontes cannot become the roommates from hell. When Stretton felt that the Bracamontes had their television up too loud, she called police. \"We could be fined up to $1,000 for disrupting our tenant,\" says Marcella. Adds Ralph, \"My TV doesn't even have surround sound. It wasn't too loud.\"Although there is no record of a similar case involving employment as a nanny, PEOPLE has found Stretton's name attached to more than a dozen cases in three Southern California counties ranging from nonpayment to property damage to negligence. Of the 13 cases found by PEOPLE dating back to 2002, she is a plaintiff in 7 cases and a defendant in 6 more. ABC News reports that she is listed by California Courts as a vexatious litigant for abusing the legal system. ||||| UPLAND (CBSLA.com) \u2014 The 64-year-old live-in nanny who has come under national fire for refusing to leave an Upland family\u2019s home is speaking out for the first time. \n \n Ralph and Marcella Bracamonte hired Diane Stretton via Craigslist, offering her room and board for taking care of their three children. \n \n After the first few months, the Bracamontes said Stretton stopped working and refused to leave her room. \n \n The family said they fired Stretton on June 6, but she told them she wasn\u2019t going to budge. \n \n Stretton told KNX 1070\u2019s Charles Feldman, however, that she was never terminated by the couple. ||||| The fired California nanny who wouldn't leave is blaming the weather, the media and physical disabilities as the reasons she hasn't moved out of her former employers' home, but said she will be out by July 4 - under certain conditions, according to an email she sent to her employer's lawyer. \n \n But Marcella Bracamonte, who fired Diane Stretton earlier this month, thinks Stretton's demands are a ploy. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t believe her. She is going to show up when I am not here with a bunch of food and water and she will barricade herself in her room,\u201d Bracamonte said. \n \n \u201cI want her to leave by tomorrow, Tuesday 4 p.m. I am not going to play games with this lady,\u201d she said. \n \n Nanny Who Wouldn't Leave Spotted Hiding in Car at Police Station \n \n Family Stumped by Fired Live-In Nanny Who Won't Leave \n \n Nanny Who Wouldn't Leave Has Disappeared \n \n Stretton, 64, was hired by Marcella and Ralph Bracamonte in early March to help care for their three children in exchange for room and board. After several weeks, Stretton stopped working and said she was unable to perform her job because health problems and only came out of her room to eat, the Bracamontes claim. The family asked Stretton to sign a letter on June 6 giving her 30 days to leave, but Stretton threatened to sue the family for elder abuse and improper firing, Marcella Bracamonte said. \n \n In an email sent this weekend to Marc Cohen, the Bracamontes' lawyer, Stretton said she tried to move out of the house but there was \"always a bunch of news vehicles right in front of the house. The media needs to be completely gone before I continue moving.\" \n \n She said her departure will now be delayed by a coming heat wave. \"The temperature over the next 5 days is expected to be near 100 degrees. I can't work in that kind of heat,\" she wrote in her email. \n \n Stretton said in her email that she wants to be able to sleep in the Bracamonte home for three more nights and to be able to shower in their bathroom. \n \n \"If the media stays away, I will be out by the 4th of July. But that depends on the circus not continuing,\" she wrote. \n \n The Bracamontes have plans to be away for July 4, but Marcella Bracamonte does not intend to leave her house unattended. \n \n \u201cI have my sister-in-laws, brother-in-laws and their children, so at least seven people will be here,\u201d she told ABC News. \n \n Stretton disappeared from the Bracamontes' house Thursday morning and was later discovered in her car outside of a police station on Friday. She has refused to speak to the media, hiding under window screen. \n \n During Stretton's standoff with the Bracamontes, her litigious past has emerged. She has a long history with litigation and is listed on California's Vexatious Litigant List, which includes people who have been found to bring legal action that is frivolous or repetitive. \n \n The majority of the lawsuits were directed at her own family members, particularly her two sisters. According to documents, Stretton tried to block her sisters from selling family property. \n \n Last year, Stretton even sued her son, Michael, according to court records, and a car rental agency for property damage and personal injury in connection with a motor vehicle accident. \n \n Court documents show that when Stretton's father, John Richardson, died in 2000, his will included Stretton's two sisters, Donna Tobey and Sharon Freeburn. Richardson \"specifically and expressly omitted Stretton,\" according to court documents.Stretton has not returned calls from ABC News.",

The case has sparked outrage from his family and local officials. \n \n \"Although we are disappointed that Pablo will remained detained, today\u2019s stay is a victory for him and his family, and also for due process and the fair administration of justice,\" Gregory Copeland, Supervising Attorney of the Immigration Law Unit at The Legal Aid Society, said in a statement. \n \n Villavicencio is an Ecuadorean citizen and was granted voluntary departure in March 2010, but failed to leave the country by July 2010 as ordered, ICE said in a previous statement. His voluntary departure then became a final order for removal. \n \n Villavicencio was detained after delivering pizza to Fort Hamilton in New York City, officials said. \n \n United States Army Garrison Fort Hamilton said in a statement this week that at around 11 a.m. on June 1 a person tried to gain access to the base without valid Department of Defense identification. \n \n In this undated family photo provided by Sandra Chica, Pablo Villavicencio poses with his two daughters, Luciana, left, and Antonia. AP \n \n The person, later identified as Villavicencio, was sent to get a daily pass and signed a waiver submitting to a background check, something standard for all visitors. The check revealed an active ICE warrant on file, Fort Hamilton said. \n \n The Legal Aid Society said the emergency stay was based on a habeas corpus petition filed Saturday morning, and that the stay will allow him to pursue relief from removal. \n \n Villavicencio\u2019s wife, who is an American citizen, has said that her husband has a pending green card application they filed in February. She said that he presented an IDNYC card, a city government-issued form of identification, and that he never had a problem before. \n \n Copeland, of the Legal Aid Society, said in the statement that the court agreed that Villavicencio \u201cshould be afforded a full and fair opportunity to present his case in Federal Court.\u201d \n \n New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, who on Friday called for an investigation into ICE conduct, wrote a letter to the field director for the Department of Homeland Security in support of an application for a stay of removal, and requested that Villavicencio be released from ICE custody. \n \n Cuomo wrote in the letter that when Villavicencio made the delivery to the base, \"it appears that there was conflict among those personnel as to whether Mr. Villavicencio needed to provide any additional identification because he was known to them based on previous deliveries he had made to the facility.\" \n \n Cuomo said that Villavicencio has been a resident of New York City for over 10 years, and that \"he is a working father, a taxpayer, and the primary provider for his U.S. citizen wife and two daughters, one of whom suffers from a serious medical condition.\" \n \n \"The circumstances of this case, including the arrest and detention of Mr. Villavicencio and the remarkable speed with which it appears he is being removed, reflects a pattern of conduct which I have previously raised with ICE as unconscionable and seemingly targeted directly at New York residents,\" Cuomo said in the letter. \"There is absolutely no legitimate reason to proceed with an expedited removal and to do so would be inhumane.\" \n \n CORRECTION (June 16, 2018, 9:40 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the date of a stay in the case. The stay was granted until July 20, not June 20. ||||| (CNN) A federal court temporarily blocked a pizza delivery man's deportation one week after he was turned over to immigration officials while trying to drop off food at a military base in New York. \n \n Pablo Villavicencio, 35, remains in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody but will be kept from deportation until July 20. Villavicencio, an undocumented immigrant from Ecuador, was detained June 1 at the Fort Hamilton base in Brooklyn while delivering an order from the brick-oven pizza restaurant in Queens where he worked. \n \n The Legal Aid Society, an organization that provides legal help to those in poverty, said in a statement Saturday that their attorneys discovered Villavicencio's deportation was imminent so they worked through the night to prepare the emergency stay request. \n \n \"This stay will allow him to pursue a meritorious form of relief from removal -- adjustment of status for permanent residency -- to remain with his family,\" the legal provider's statement said. \n \n Gregory Copeland, supervising attorney of the Immigration Law Unit at The Legal Aid Society, said the stay is a victory for Villavicencio, his family and for \"due process and the fair administration of justice.\" \n \n \"This decision is also a reminder that the judiciary can still serve as a powerful check when other branches of government make hasty, cruel and reckless decisions,\" he said. \n \n He had been to the base 'many times,' attorney says \n \n Villavicencio's potential deportation triggered a national response and fear in immigrant communities. \n \n Villavicencio filed for his green card in February and was waiting for a response when he was detained, his wife, Sandra Chica, said. \n \n Chica is a US citizen and they have two young daughters who were born in the United States. \n \n \"He's got the wheels in motion in terms of pursuing a legal path to normalizing his status in the country,\" Copeland told CNN. \n \n The day he was detained, Villavicencio was trying to deliver an order to the Fort Hamilton Army base in Brooklyn. He showed his New York City identification card to the guard as he had done several times before, but the base said in a statement that he didn't have the proper identification, so he had to get a daily visitor pass. \n \n Villavicencio ended up \"signing a waiver permitting a background check,\" which revealed there was an active warrant for his deportation and prompted military police to call immigration agents. \n \n In an interview Sunday, Copeland told CNN that Villavicencio had been to the military base \"many times\" in the past to make similar deliveries. He'd been there enough, Copeland said, that he was familiar with the facility's personnel. \n \n In fact, Copeland claims that in the midst of being detained on June 1, Villavicencio called a high-ranking sergeant at the base for help. According to Copeland, the sergeant, who was not named, unsuccessfully tried to intervene. \n \n There were also \"conflicting reports,\" Copeland said, about whether Villavicencio had actually formally consented to a background check. Copeland called for an investigation into the incident, and reiterated that Villavicencio does not have a criminal record. \n \n 'Our immigrant communities are threatened' \n \n In response to Villavicencio's arrest, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote two letters to high-ranking officials calling for an investigation into ICE and for Villavicencio's release. \n \n In a Friday letter to Department of Homeland Security Acting Inspector General John Kelly, Cuomo said immigrant communities are being vilified and profiled as a result of ICE tactics. \n \n \"New York will not sit on the sidelines as our immigrant communities are threatened,\" Cuomo wrote. \"The pattern of conduct demonstrated by ICE agents shows reckless contempt for the Constitution and runs counter to the agency's stated mission as well as federal and state law. I call on your office to immediately investigate ICE tactics and ensure the rights of New Yorkers are being protected.\" \n \n Cuomo wrote a letter Saturday to Thomas Decker, field office director of the Department of Homeland Security and Customs Enforcement, explaining that Villavicencio has been a resident of New York for more than 10 years and is a working father, taxpayer and the primary provider for his wife and children, one of whom has a serious medical condition. \n \n Cuomo also said speed with which ICE is moving to deport Villavicencio threatens to violate his rights, his family's due process rights and creates \"an unnecessary humanitarian crisis in New York State.\" \n \n \"There is absolutely no legitimate reason to proceed with an expedited removal and to do so would be inhumane,\" Cuomo wrote. \"The proper course of action here is to stay Mr. Villavicencio's removal and release him from detention so that he may reunite with his family and participate in the proper adjudication of his case. The Constitutional guarantee of due process affords him that basic right.\"",

    "document": "Unfortunately, Laura Linney doesn't come across as a dying woman struggling to save her own life so much as a really dorky PTA mom dressed up as a clown in order to bring a little cheer to the children's cancer ward. Having just been diagnosed with Stage IV melanoma, Cathy (Linney) is haunted by the specter of approaching death, yes, but she's also super-determined to do a goofy little dance and spray a little water out of her flower lapel into some poor leukemia patient's eye. She's going to smile quizzically and shrug and give you an \"Aw shucks, what can I say, folks? I'm here for 18 more months!\" (Da dum dum -- ch!) and what are you going to do? Laugh? \n \n Now that we've established my relative worthlessness in the big scheme of things, I will tell you one thing I know beyond a shadow of a doubt: A comedy about cancer needs to be really, really funny. Otherwise, it will be awful. With \" The Big C \" (premieres 10:30 p.m., Aug. 16, on Showtime), all of the vital signs looked good from the start. You've got Laura Linney, an actress who has been easy to love ever since she charmed the world as Mark Ruffalo's weary older sister in \"You Can Count On Me.\" You've got Oliver Platt, known for his ability to pump vim and vigor into other oddball premium cable shows like \"Bored to Death\" and \"Huff.\" \n \n Cancer. I don't like typing that word. My sister goes to work every day and cuts cancer out of people's bodies, and I can't even type the word \"cancer\" without cringing. My sister looks people right in the eyes and tells them whether they'll live for another year or die in a few weeks -- and I watch shows about rich housewives for a living. \n \n No. You're going to cringe and beg to be put out of your misery. \n \n Now I'm going to make a wild, inappropriate guess here. I'm going to guess that either show creator Darlene Hunt or Laura Linney or both of them were given the following note at some point: \"Lighten it up!\" Maybe some test audience thought the story was too gloomy, too depressing, too focused on death. \"Death? Yuck!\" they said. \"We don't want death. We want zany pot-dealer moms who shrug and slurp on frappuccinos! We want zany multiple-personality-disorder moms who shrug and toss back canned beer! We want zany nurse moms who shrug and pop prescription drugs and have affairs with their pharmacist buddies! But zany control-freak moms who shrug and get naked in the back yard, because they're about to die? No thank you! Cheer this mother up, give her a jaunty smile, a kick in her step! Make her flirt openly with her much-younger doctor! Make her scare the bejeezus out of her snarky teenage son! When she's sad about stuff, make it clear that she's also just feeling so lucky to be alive for another day! You know what this dying mom needs? She needs to smile more often! Haven't you read 'Crazy Sexy Cancer'?\" \n \n So here's Linney, smiling through every scene, cracking really funny jokes about only having a few months to live, jokes about as fun and lighthearted as an unexpected spray of water in your chemo-bloodshot eyes. Here's Cathy feeling pleased that she goaded her doctor into admitting that she has a killer rack. Here's Cathy eating only desserts and doing cartwheels in the hallway of the school where she teaches and getting a pool installed in her backyard and riding a bicycle built for two with a flower basket and streamers coming out of the handlebars. Kooky, unsexy cancer! \n \n Cathy doesn't want chemo for her melanoma. She doesn't want any treatment that will only make her bald. She doesn't want to tell anyone she has cancer. She just wants to play practical jokes and set stuff on fire! She just wants to kick her husband, Paul (Platt), out of the house, because he's an overgrown kid, gosh darn it! She just wants to hang out with her crazy homeless-by-choice brother, the one who spends his life in various parking lots, yelling at people about how their SUVs are destroying the earth. Cathy's plucky, to-hell-with-it approach should be moving, but instead it comes off with all of the grace and ease of a grizzly bear in a ballerina skirt. Cathy titters. She sighs and squints. She giggles nervously and smiles in a pinched way. \n \n But let's not blame this show's flaws on cancer. Cathy is a mom who suggests to her son that they \"chillax\" together. When he calls her gay, she yells anemically after him, \"Don't use 'gay' like that!\" \"You're sooo not allowed to say I'm embarrassing,\" she warns her brother, Sean (John Benjamin Hickey), who spends every episode saying things like, \"Enjoy your swirly chemicals!\" and \"Wake up and smell your $10 latte!\" \n \n Oliver Platt, on the other hand, succeeds at milking every oddly melancholic moment as Linney's husband. Paul rages at Cathy's inscrutability, he confesses his deepest secrets to a therapist, he misunderstands and becomes lustful and retreats and somehow Platt makes it all believable. We buy this guy as a real person, in all of his selfish, needy, self-pitying glory. Maybe the overgrown boy role is just easier to pull off, or maybe Platt is particularly great at walking that line between comic and tragic. \n \n I really want to love Linney in this role, because she's a great actress and she does pull off about half of her scenes in \"The Big C.\" But there's just something leaden and unnatural about the way her role is written and performed, as if someone is standing on the sidelines yelling \"Smiles, everyone! Smiles!\" the whole time. Because if you take the Linney we've seen before -- a little gloomy, a little shrill \u2013 and insert her into this picture, it works so much better. Instead, Cathy seems self-conscious in everything she does. She spends most of each episode grinning from ear to ear like the reluctant host of a sorority rush party, counting the seconds until she's free to get drunk on cosmopolitans. \n \n On the page, \"The Big C\" is occasionally clever. But the mood of the actual show is all wrong. The timing is off. The heavy scenes are almost as badly timed and directed as the funny scenes, and those scenes that alternate between funny and sad only induce whiplash. None of the emotions in play feel remotely organic or nuanced or sweet. And by the end of the third episode, we understand exactly what we're going to see, over and over again, throughout the course of the first season: Beleaguered, denial-plagued smiley mom, man-child husband, insolent son, angry shut-in neighbor, angry overweight girl (played by Gabourey Sidibe from \"Precious\") trying to diet, angry radical brother. Simply putting one nutty character in a room with another nutty character does not a comedy make, yet that's what each scene of this show boils down to. \n \n And that's a shame. Because \"The Big C\" could be a great show; it should be a great show. There are so many possibilities. Death brings out the best and the worst in everyone and everything, and it can be very funny -- just ask anyone who's dealt with the death of someone close to them. Instead, \"The Big C\" offers us the same stuff we've seen before from every cancer subplot on every TV show ever made: cute younger doctors, annoying cancer support groups, impulsive decisions and an interminable wait for the moment when our patient finally tells her family she's sick. \"I'm here all year, performing at stage IV!\" Cathy yells to an imaginary audience at the end of the first episode. \"Come on, you've gotta give it up for me a little bit! It's kinda funny -- death comedy?\" In this case, unfortunately, it's not. ||||| Those who die on crime series like \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cThe Wire\u201d do so to help \u2014 or hurt \u2014 the ones left standing.

In this case, \"The Big C\" could also refer to several other things \u2014 the big concept, for instance. Showtime has developed an alarming penchant for putting women in extreme situations and playing it for comedy, albeit of the darker variety. But cancer is still dicey, hitting closer to home for many viewers than, say, split personalities ( \"United States of Tara\" ) or even drug addiction (\"Nurse Jackie.\")\"The Big C\" could also mean \"big cast.\" Much has been made of critics' darling Laura Linney and her decision to enter the world of serialized television (though no doubt her Emmy win for HBO 's \" John Adams \" made it a tiny bit easier). Here she is joined by fellow stage actor John Benjamin Hickey (\"Love! Valour! Compassion!\"), the wonderfully elastic and prolific Oliver Platt , \"Precious\" Oscar nominee Gabourey Sidibe and veteran performer Phyllis Somerville (\" NYPD Blue,\" \"Little Children\"), who inevitably steals every scene she's in.The pilot is also directed by Bill Condon , but that seems to be pushing the whole \"things that begin with C\" conceit. Still, even on paper, \"The Big C\" has a lot going on. Then the action starts and things get, well, Crazy. And not necessarily in a good way.Linney's Cathy is a high school teacher who has just learned that the large and unmistakably problematic splotch on her back is Stage 4 melanoma. She is not interested in pursuing experimental treatments or sharing this information with any of the people closest to her. Instead, she begins to survey her life through the lens of its newly measured length, and much of what she sees is not to her liking.She has a husband (Platt) so unapologetically childish that he says things like \"stinky poo poo\" and still gets drunk enough to pee on the front lawn; a son (Gabriel Basso) who is insolent and selfish even by early-teen standards; a wild-haired neighbor ( Somerville ) who seems to have wandered out of a Flannery O'Connor short story; a hateful, mouthy summer school student (Sidibe) and a homeless eco-activist brother (Hickey) given to wearing plastic bags around his neck.All of whom are introduced in the pilot, by the way, and this is a half-hour show.Clearly, creator and executive producer Darlene Hunt is not sending Cathy gentle into that good night or anywhere else for that matter. No, Cathy will be dropping f-bombs , digging nonpermitted pools and splattering school buses with paintballs. Although \"The Big C\" does pose the eternal question \u2014 How would you live your life if you knew its actual dimensions? \u2014 it tries very hard not to take the expected path.Too hard, unfortunately. So determined are Hunt, executive producer/showrunner Jenny Bicks and Linney that \"The Big C\" be unsentimental that they jam early episodes with so many over-blown characters and wacky antics that it's impossible to attach meaning to any of them. Platt especially is almost criminally misused; as middle-aged wild child to Cathy's more orderly (read: controlling) adult, he wanders in and out of scenes like some infantile forest creature, defined only by wifely resentment, unrecognizable as an adult male (much less one who has, apparently, a job big enough to pay for the very nice house in suburban Connecticut).Linney, who has made a career exploring the fear and rage that is so often disguised as devotion, summons her not-inconsiderable charms to create a woman teetering between breakdown and breakthrough. That Cathy has no friends outside her eccentric brother is less than believable, but it's a fair enough narrative decision. Much of the early story revolves around Cathy forming relationships with Sidibe's Andrea, whom she has decided to save from her weight problem, and Somerville's Marlene, who has hard-won wisdom to offer.But while many of the scenes of \"The Big C\" are compelling in themselves, taken together they create a manic and manipulative half-hour. In attempting to capture the freefall of discovering that life will be a matter of months instead of years, Hunt and her writers have surrounded Cathy with so much attention-grabbing insanity \u2014 She must have a pool! A smackdown with Andrea, another with Marlene! Her brother is a nut! But maybe he's right! No way is her son going to summer camp! And how can she live with a man who never closes the cupboard doors! \u2014 that it's hard to keep your eyes on the woman herself.Cathy's decision to keep the news of her cancer to herself is the closest thing we get to a through-line, and fortunately, it's a very good one. We all carry the certainty of our own end with us \u2014 as poet laureate W.S. Merwin reminds us: \"Every year without knowing it I have passed the day / When the last fires will wave to me\" \u2014 though for the most part we do it without discussion or even acknowledgment. How then should knowing the particulars change us, and what part of that knowledge do we owe friends and family? Watching Cathy flail wildly at her husband and child, one can't help but think she is treating them unfairly by not explaining what is really going on. But whatreally going on? Every day is another step toward the last, even for a teenager, and who's to say that Cathy is closer to her end than any of those around her?There are enough graceful moments in \"The Big C\" and certainly enough fine actors to hope that in subsequent episodes, things will slow down, that the grim determination to be \"different\" will give way to something, if not less outraged or outrageous, then less visibly straining to be so.",

His seriously wounded nephew, Larry Eugene Johnson Jr., 28, was inside the trailer when authorities arrived. \n \n The rooster, reportedly named \u201cBubba,\u201d is of a variety that\u2019s bred to engage in combat, but had been Timothy Johnson\u2019s \u201cpet\u201d for several years, Meigs County Sheriff\u2019s Office Investigator Alex Clary said. The bird was found tied to a chair outside the trailer. \n \n \u201cI guess that\u2019s the way these people keep their chickens,\u201d Clary said. \u201cI\u2019m having a hard time believing it was over a chicken.\u201d \n \n The bird was unharmed and left with food and water within reach. \n \n Timothy Johnson had arrived at Larry Johnson\u2019s mobile home and confronted his nephew to accuse him of stealing the gamecock, according to a news release from 9th Judicial District Attorney General Russell Johnson. \n \n Larry Johnson told a bystander his uncle had drawn a gun and that he was trying to grab the gun when he was shot in his chest under his left arm, according to the release. Larry Johnson \u201cretreated and returned fire multiple times with a pistol he was carrying,\u201d according to the release. \n \n Larry Johnson was armed with a semi-automatic handgun that held 17 shots, the prosecutor said, and authorities estimated at least 11 gunshots were fired. Timothy Johnson, who apparently was standing when shot, was struck four times, authorities said. \n \n Timothy Johnson fired a single-action .38-caliber revolver. A loaded .22-caliber pistol was found in one of his pockets. \n \n Larry Johnson was flown by medical helicopter to the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville, where he was listed in stable condition Thursday afternoon. \n \n Timothy Johnson\u2019s body was taken to the Regional Forensics Center in Knoxville for an autopsy. \n \n The district attorney general on Thursday said details remained \u201ckind of fuzzy\u201d over the exact nature of the dust-up between uncle and nephew. \n \n Meigs County Sheriff Jackie Melton asked for the assistance of the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation, and the district attorney general said he gave that go-ahead. Meigs County Sheriff\u2019s Office investigators Clary and Scotty Wiggins are also working the case. \n \n The prosecutor said his office will await the conclusion of the autopsy and toxicology results and completion of an investigative file before presenting the case to the Meigs County grand jury. That panel next meets in November. ||||| DECATUR (WATE) \u2013 A shootout in Meigs County over the alleged theft of a gamecock ended with the rooster\u2019s owner killed and his nephew in the hospital. \n \n District Attorney Russell Johnson\u2019s office says officials were called to a home on Moore Cemetery Road in Decatur just after 2 a.m. Wednesday morning for a shooting call. Larry Eugene Johnson, Jr. was inside one of two mobile homes on the property with a gunshot wound to the chest. His uncle Timothy Dewayne Johnson was dead from apparent gunshot wounds in the driveway. \n \n April Johnson, Larry\u2019s wife, was inside the home when this happened. \n \n \u201cI heard yelling and then I heard gun shots. I heard one gun shot. I heard two gun shots and then I heard multiple gun shots and then I didn\u2019t hear nothing else,\u201d said Johnson. \n \n Investigators say Timothy Johnson had come to the home and confronted Larry Johnson about the alleged theft of his prized fighting rooster. April says her husband had no part in that. \n \n \u201cMy husband didn\u2019t steal no chicken. We hadn\u2019t seen him in forever,\u201d said April Johnson. \n \n Then things started to get heated. Apparently, Larry Johnson told someone with him that Timothy Johnson drew a gun. Larry Johnson tried to grab his uncle\u2019s gun when he was shot in the chest. \n \n That\u2019s when Larry fired back several times with his own gun. His uncle ended up dying in the driveway while he scrambled to get inside the home. \n \n \u201cHe yelled, \u2018April, come here. He shot me. Call 911,'\u201d said April Johnson. \n \n Larry Johnson was flown to UT Medical Center and is still in the intensive care unit, according to family members. His wife said he has two broken ribs along with a punctured lung and a bullet still inside him. \n \n Timothy Johnson\u2019s family is convinced the rooster was taken by Larry. Johnson While that\u2019s debatable, both sides do agree this shouldn\u2019t have happened. \n \n \u201cRegardless of grudges or whatever the case may be, this ain\u2019t the way to solve anything because nobody wins in the end,\u201d said April Johnson. \n \n April Johnson says her husband shot his uncle out of self defense. Both families say the two men had a good relationship and they didn\u2019t expect this to happen. \n \n Timothy Johnson\u2019s body has been taken for autopsy.

Then came the doubts about investigators' conclusion that it was an accident. \n \n But the discovery that their son's body and skull had been stuffed with newspaper before burial added a horrific new dimension to their anguish and further fueled their skepticism of the official findings. \n \n \"We have been let down again,\" his father, Kenneth Johnson, told CNN. \"When we buried Kendrick, we thought we were burying Kendrick, not half of Kendrick.\" \n \n Kendrick Johnson was found dead in a gym at Lowndes County High School in January. State medical examiners concluded that the three-sport athlete suffocated after getting stuck in a rolled-up gym mat while reaching for a sneaker. \n \n Death was not accidental, family's autopsy finds \n \n His parents, Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, never have bought that explanation. They won a court order to have their son's body exhumed and a second autopsy performed in June. \n \n During an autopsy, internal organs are removed and examined before being returned for burial. But when Dr. Bill Anderson, the private pathologist who conducted the second autopsy, opened up the teen's remains, the brain, heart, lungs, liver and other viscera were missing. Every organ from the pelvis to the skull was gone. \n \n JUST WATCHED New evidence in Kendrick Johnson's death Replay More Videos ...

But in a letter to the Johnsons' attorney, funeral home owner Antonio Harrington said his firm never received the teen's organs. Harrington wrote that the organs \"were destroyed through natural process\" due to the position of Kendrick Johnson's body when he died, and \"discarded by the prosector before the body was sent back to Valdosta.\" A prosector dissects the body for pathological examination. \n \n Scene points to foul play \n \n Stuffing a body with old newsprint and department-store circulars -- \"like he was a garbage can,\" as Jacquelyn Johnson put it -- isn't exactly standard practice in forensic pathology or the mortician's trade.

That's a finding his family has never accepted, and one challenged by the findings of a second autopsy they commissioned. \n \n Now, death scene imagery obtained exclusively by CNN has led a former FBI agent to question how the three-sport athlete died. \n \n Original story: Family demands answers in teen's death \n \n \"I don't believe this was an accident. I think this young man met with foul play,\" said Harold Copus, now an Atlanta private investigator. \n \n And Johnson's father, Kenneth Johnson, said he believes authorities aren't leveling with his family. \n \n \"They know something happened in that gym, and they don't want it to come out,\" he said. \n \n 'Accidental' death challenged by new autopsy \n \n A 15-minute video and nearly 700 photos taken by sheriff's investigators in Lowndes County documented the horrific scene. Johnson's body, clad in jeans and and layered orange and white T-shirts, was found wedged into a rolled-up wrestling mat in January. His face was bloated with pooled blood, some of which had poured out of his body, soaking his dreadlocks and spilling onto the floor. \n \n There were more streaks of blood on a nearby wall -- but it wasn't Johnson's, according to investigators. Meanwhile, Copus said there appeared to be no blood on a sneaker that the teen supposedly was attempting to reach, located inches beneath him. \n \n A pair of orange-and-black gym shoes found a few yards from the body had a substance that looked like blood on them, but investigators told CNN the stains weren't blood -- and so the shoes weren't collected as potential evidence. The same went for a hooded sweatshirt found a few feet away from the teen. \n \n Copus said he can't explain how investigators handled items found around the gym. \n \n Family: Kendrick's death wasn't accidental \n \n \"If you're running a crime scene, then you're going to say 'That's potential evidence. Obviously, we're going to check this out and find out who does it belong to,' \" he said. \n \n Lowndes County Sheriff Chris Prine refused to discuss the case with CNN, saying, \"Our case is closed.\" But in June, an independent pathologist who conducted a second autopsy for the Johnson family found the teen suffered a blow to the right side of his neck that was \"consistent with inflicted injury.\" \n \n In May, sheriff's Lt. Stryde Jones told CNN that investigators tested the bloodstains on the nearby wall, \"and it was not the blood of Kendrick Johnson.\" Investigators haven't determined whose blood it was, \"but it doesn't appear to be involved in our crime in any way,\" he said. \n \n \"In the opinion of our crime scene personnel, after looking at it closely, the blood appeared as if it'd been there for an extended period of time. It didn't appear to be very fresh,\" Jones said. \n \n But Copus said it's difficult to believe that old bloodstains weren't cleaned up. \n \n \"There is no way that they would allow whoever was supposed to clean this gym to leave that blood on that wall,\" he said. \n \n In September, the Justice Department said it wouldn't open a civil rights investigation into Johnson's death. But federal prosecutors in south Georgia are reviewing the imagery to determine whether a separate investigation is necessary, the U.S. attorney's office in Macon told CNN. \n \n For Johnson's father, the evidence is clear. \n \n \"Someone murdered him,\" he said. \"They should be in jail.\" \n \n Justice Department won't probe teen's death \n \n Watch Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 weeknights 10pm ET.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 The plot has again thickened in the mysterious death of Georgia teen Kendrick Johnson: A second autopsy on the 17-year-old's exhumed body has found that before burial almost all of his organs were replaced with newspaper. Kendrick was found dead in a rolled-up wrestling mat at his school in January, in what was originally ruled an accidental asphyxiation. But his parents were suspicious and had him exhumed and examined by a private doctor. That doctor found evidence of \"non-accidental\" trauma, and now reveals that every organ from Kendrick's pelvis to skull\u2014including his brain, lungs, heart, and liver\u2014is missing, CNN reports. Newspapers were stuffed into the cavities the organs should have occupied \"like he was a garbage can,\" his mother says. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which conducted the first autopsy, says it put all the organs back in afterward. But the funeral home that embalmed Kendrick tells the family's attorney that before it got the body the organs \"were destroyed through natural process,\" and then \"discarded by the prosecutor.\" The county sheriff, meanwhile, says the death is a closed case and refuses to discuss it. Yesterday, CNN revealed photos and video from the scene of Kendrick's death that raise serious questions about investigators' work, showing among other things blood stains on the wall that weren't investigated. \"They know something happened in that gym,\" Kendrick's father says, \"and they don't want it to come out.\" Click for more on the case.",

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (Associated Press) \n \n Obama spoke not long after Boehner's office issued a statement that insisted the two sides remained far apart and that Republicans had never, as the White House contends, agreed on $33 billion in cuts to the federal spending allotment for the remaining six months of the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. \n \n Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Boehner and Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid met in the White House Tuesday as the clock ticked toward a midnight Friday expiration of the government's spending authority. \n \n \"We are closer than we have ever been to an agreement. There is no reason why we should not get an agreement,\" Obama said in a surprise appearance in the White House reporters briefing room. \n \n The president said Boehner and Reid were meeting later Tuesday, but if that session produced no agreement he would summon both men back to the White House Wednesday and daily thereafter, if necessary. \n \n \"Myself, Joe Biden, my team we are prepared to meet for as long as possible to get this resolved,\" Obama said. \n \n Obama had barely finished speaking when Boehner strode before microphones to insist that the White House and Senate Democrats bow to demands for deeper cuts. Boehner is under extreme pressure from newly elected House members, many with allegiance to the ultraconservative tea party, to slash spending, the size of government and lower taxes. \n \n Short of a long-term deal, Boehner has proposed an agreement that would keep the government running for one more week and cut another $12 billion in spending. Boehner has already orchestrated action by Congress to pass a pair of stopgap bills, so far cutting $10 billion from an estimated $1.2 trillion budget to fund the day-to-day operations of government through the fiscal accounting period. \n \n Obama said he would only accept another short-term funding extension, of two or three days, to get a longer-term deal through Congress. But he ruled out a longer extension to allow negotiations to continue. \n \n \"That is not a way to run a government. I cannot have our agencies making plans based on two week budgets,\" Obama said. \"What we are not going to do is once again put off something that should have been done months ago.\" \n \n Boehner said Republicans \"will not be put in a box\" of accepting options they refuse to endorse. \n \n Democrats accuse Republicans of pushing for harmful spending cuts and attaching a social policy agenda to the must-pass spending bill. Boehner counters that the White House is pressing gimmicky budget cuts. \n \n As a government shutdown appeared increasingly inevitable, the White House has begun advising government agencies on the proper steps in preparation for a shutdown of the government. Republicans on Monday disclosed plans to instruct lawmakers \"on how the House would operate in the event Senate Democrats shut down the government.\" \n \n And in a memo to agency officials, the deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jeffrey Zients, urged agency heads to refine and update contingency plans in the event negotiators don't strike a deal by Friday's deadline. \n \n Boehner's one-week plan could reassure tea party-backed lawmakers who are among the most vocal in seeking to reduce the size and scope of the government. It could also put pressure on Democrats and the White House to offer greater spending cuts. \n \n But there's no visible movement on an impasse over Republican policy riders attacking Obama's health care and financial reform laws, cutting taxpayer funds to Planned Parenthood and reversing a host of Obama's environmental policies. \n \n On a separate long-term track, Republicans controlling the House have fashioned plans to slash the budget deficit by more than $5 trillion over the upcoming decade, combining unprecedented spending cuts with a fundamental restructuring of taxpayer-financed health care for the elderly and the poor. \n \n House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan unveiled the Republican budget blueprint Tuesday morning just as Boehner headed to the White House. \n \n Ryan's program includes a controversial proposal to convert the traditional Medicare health care program for the aged into a system by which private insurers would operate plans approved by the federal government. \n \n Current Medicare beneficiaries or workers age 55 and older would stay in the existing system. \n \n At the same time, Republicans propose to sharply cut projected spending on the Medicaid state-federal health program for the poor and disabled and transform it into a block grant program that gives governors far less money than under current estimates, but considerably more flexibility.",

Must be proactive!' Trump tweets. \n \n British officials rebuked President Donald Trump on Friday for claiming that the individuals responsible for setting off explosives in the London subway had been \u201cin the sights of\u201d law enforcement who failed to be \u201cproactive.\u201d \n \n Prime Minister Theresa May reproached Trump for his rhetoric in the wake of what police are investigating as a terrorist attack that injured at least 29 people. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n \u201cI never think it\u2019s helpful for anybody to speculate on what is an ongoing investigation,\u201d she said. \u201cAs I\u2019ve just said, the police and security services are working to discover the full circumstances of this cowardly attack and to identify all those responsible.\u201d \n \n Trump earlier on Friday had used the latest attack to offer tough talk on terrorism, and implied that Scotland Yard officials had fallen down on the job \u2014 although it\u2019s unclear what non-public information, if any, the president based the comment on. \n \n \u201cAnother attack in London by a loser terrorist,\u201d Trump tweeted early Friday morning. \u201cThese are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!\u201d \n \n He wrote in a follow-up post that \u201closer terrorists\u201d should \u201cbe dealt with in a much tougher manner\u201d and urged the U.S. to curb their internet access, which serves as a recruiting tool for terrorists. \n \n Breaking News Alerts Get breaking news when it happens \u2014 in your inbox.

McMaster appeared to try to clean up Trump's comment, telling reporters later on Friday afternoon that Trump was speaking generally about Scotland Yard, and that he was trying to broadly convey that law enforcement is focused on the threat of terrorism. \n \n \u201cFor years, Scotland Yard has been a leader, as our FBI has been a leader. So I think if there was a terrorist attack here, God forbid, that we would say that they were in the sights of the FBI,\u201d McMaster said. \u201cSo I think he didn\u2019t mean anything beyond that.\u201d \n \n Trump and his administration have stoked the ire of British officials before. The U.K. earlier this year temporarily ceased intelligence sharing with the U.S. after images from an attack in Manchester were leaked to and published in U.S. media, infuriating British officials.

He said the tweet is \u201cso unhelpful from leader of our ally and intelligence partner.\u201d \n \n Trump told reporters in the Rose Garden later Friday morning that the attack is \u201ca terrible thing\u201d and reiterated his calls for America to \u201cbe very smart\u201d and get \u201cvery, very tough.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re not nearly tough enough,\u201d said Trump, who added that he would call May on Friday. \u201cThat is just an absolutely terrible thing.\u201d \n \n May offered her thoughts to \u201cthose injured at Parsons Green and emergency services who are responding bravely to this terrorist incident\u201d in her initial statement. \n \n As of late Friday morning, Trump hadn\u2019t publicly offered his thoughts and prayers or pledged America\u2019s support to London, but the White House said he did so privately in a call with May. \n \n Trump conveyed \u201chis sympathies and prayers for those injured in the terrorist attack today in London,\u201d the administration said in a statement. \u201cThe president pledged to continue close collaboration with the United Kingdom to stop attacks worldwide targeting innocent civilians and to combat extremism.\u201d \n \n Trump later said during a speech at Joint Base Andrews that he expressed \"America\u2019s deepest sympathy as well as our absolute commitment to eradicating the terrorists from our planet\" to the British prime minister during the call. The president then vowed to eradicate \"radical Islamic terrorism.\" The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks just prior to Trump's appearance. \n \n Trump also touted that the U.S. military's capability could be \"both effective and overwhelming\" in responding to the threat of terrorism and that of North Korea, which Thursday launched yet another ballistic missile over Japan, inflaming tensions in the region. \n \n Trump and May also spoke of the recent North Korean nuclear test, according to a U.K. readout of the conversation, \"agreeing it was a reckless provocation and that China must now use all its leverage to bring pressure to bear on the North Korean regime to ensure they change course and end these illegal tests.\u201d \n \n Earlier on Friday Trump had followed up his tweets on the London incident with one criticizing the administration of former President Barack Obama while claiming success against fighting terrorists. \n \n \u201cWe have made more progress in the last nine months against ISIS than the Obama Administration has made in 8 years,\u201d he said in the tweet. \u201cMust be proactive & nasty!\u201d \n \n Tara Palmeri and Cristiano Lima contributed to this report. ||||| Theresa May rebuked Donald Trump over the Parsons Green Tube attack after he suggested those responsible had been \u201cin the sights of Scotland Yard\u201d. \n \n Mrs May called the intervention by the US president \u201cunhelpful\u201d, as he appeared to claim Britain needed to be \u201ctougher\u201d and more \u201cproactive\u201d in the fight against terrorism. \n \n The diplomatic row threatened to undermine the special relationship and intelligence sharing arrangements between the UK and US. \n \n Mr Trump, not for the first time, also used the attack to justify his controversial proposed travel ban on people from some predominantly Muslim countries entering the US. \n \n Following a backlash against his comments the president said he would be telephoning Mrs May \u201cright now\u201d. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

    "document": "It is of no surprise that the Great Recession had an impact on the retirement plans of many Americans. What is a shock though is just by how much. A component in the Federal Reserve\u2019s Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households quantifies the number: roughly 40% of people 45 and over who were not yet retired have pushed back their retirement plans. \n \n This is no simple report to ignore, and this can affect the future of many things in America. It can affect Social Security, it can affect the financial markets via contributions and withdrawals of retirement funds, and it can affect the future workforce demographics in that older workers may simply not be removing themselves from the workforce, making it impossible for younger workers to graduate or move up. \n \n In how much (or any) contribution is being made, some 54% of those with incomes under $25,000 reported having no retirement savings or pension. This compares with only 10% of those earning $100,000 or more. \n \n Roughly one-third reported that they plan to retire at the same age as they had planned prior to 2008, and 36% now plan to retire at a later age than before the recession. The age breakdown is where the data gets skewed: some 41% of adults aged 45 and over now plan to retire at a later date than they had before 2008, and only 5% who gave at least some thought to retirement now plan to retire sooner than they had prior to 2008. \n \n ALSO READ: America\u2019s Best Companies to Work For \n \n Among those aged 55 to 64 who had not yet retired, only 18% plan to follow the traditional retirement model of working full time until a set date and then stop working altogether. Some 24% expected to keep working as long as possible, and another 18% expected to retire and then work a part-time job. Another 9% said that they expect to retire and then become self-employed. \n \n Another retirement scare is a tale you have heard, but this quantifies it. The Fed showed that although the long-term shift from defined-benefit to defined-contribution (from pension to 401(K) and IRA) plans places significant responsibilities on individuals to plan for their own retirement, only about one-fourth appear to be actively doing so. \n \n Here is the true issue affecting many: they are clueless about their retirement! When asked how they and their spouse will pay for expenses in retirement, a whopping one-fourth of all respondents (and even 14% of those aged 45 or more) chose the answer \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d \n \n I don\u2019t know. This is a scarier notion than improper planning \u2014 it is not having a plan at all. \n \n We have outlined the full Fed household survey as well. ||||| One in five people who are near retirement age have zero money saved. \n \n Yes, you read that correctly. \n \n The sobering statistic was one of many released by the Federal Reserve on Thursday as part of its report on the economic well-being of U.S. households, which surveyed more than 4,100 people online last year between mid-September and early October. \n \n The study offered a stark reminder that as more Americans are made responsible for their own retirement, most are not saving nearly enough. Overall, 31 percent of people said they have zero money saved for retirement and do not have a pension. That included 19 percent of people between the ages of 55 and 64, or those closest to retirement age. \n \n What's going on here? A lot of people said they rarely thought about retirement, at least not until it was too late. About 41 percent of people ages 18 to 29 said they never thought about retirement planning, a number that understandably declined to 20 percent for people above the age of 60. \n \n But researchers said the dismal saving rates weren't fully explained by lack of caring. They also cited a combination of low resources and poor awareness: \n \n The lack of preparedness is not signaled by a lack of planning alone. Many respondents, particularly those with limited incomes, indicated that they simply have few or no financial resources available for retirement. \n \n For many people, particularly those working part time or earning low wages, the biggest obstacle to a steady retirement savings plan is access. About three-fourths of private sector workers with full-time jobs have access to a retirement plan, but that number drops to 37 percent for part-time workers, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n \n So, what did workers say about how they expected to cover expenses in retirement? The biggest resource people planned to rely on, whether they had savings or not, was Social Security, which was cited by roughly 45 percent of respondents. \n \n A lot of people said they would just keep working: About one-third of the people surveyed said they delayed their retirement date after the financial crisis. Among the people closest to retirement, those ages 45 and over, that number increases to 41 percent. \n \n Only 18 percent of people said they envisioned having a traditional retirement where they would work full time until a particular date and then stop working completely. About a quarter of respondents said they plan to work as long as possible. And another 18 percent said they expect to take on a part-time job. \n \n Not surprisingly, the most common savings vehicle was a defined contribution plan such as a 401(k) or 403(b), used by 44 percent of the people surveyed. That compares to 18 percent of people who said they were eligible to receive a pension from their employers. \n \n (Correction: This story has been updated to correct that three-fourths of private sector workers with full-time jobs have access to a retirement plan.) \n \n Read More: \n \n A third of consumers with credit files had debts in collections last year \n \n Americans\u2019 checking accounts are filling with cash, but they\u2019re afraid to spend it \n \n About 100 million Americans are now using credit unions. Should you join them? ||||| New data from the Federal Reserve highlight how many Americans continue to struggle financially more than five years after the end of the Great Recession. \n \n As of September 2013, when the central bank conducted the poll, a quarter of families said they were \"just getting by,\" while an additional 13 percent were struggling to make ends meet. \n \n Asked to compare their current financial situation with how they were faring five years ago, as the housing crash was wreaking havoc on the economy, 34 percent of respondents said they were doing \"somewhat or much worse\" than in 2008. The same percentage reported essentially treading water, while 30 percent said they were doing better. \n \n \"Given that respondents were being asked to compare their incomes to 2008, when the United States was in the depths of the financial crisis, the fact that over two-thirds of respondents reported being the same or worse off financially highlights the uneven nature of the recovery,\" the Federal Reserve said in the report. \n \n The Fed found that more than 60 percent of U.S. families were either \"doing OK\" or \"living comfortably.\" \n \n The survey of 4,100 households was conducted between September and October of last year. Since then, economic growth has been inconsistent. The nation's GDP shrank 2.1 percent over the first three months of the year, when harsh winter weather slowed consumer spending and dented the housing sector. But GDP surged to an annualized 4 percent between April and June, while the job market has strengthened in recent months. \n \n Americans' biggest financial concerns centered on three issues, the Fed found: retirement, education and jobs. And even with the economy seemingly on the mend, other findings from the Fed survey highlight the financial challenges many Americans still face. \n \n For instance, a third of households who had applied for credit in the previous 12 months reported being turned down or getting less than they asked for. Meanwhile, 10 percent of households said their income fluctuates significantly from month to month, largely because of an irregular work schedule or because respondents are unemployed. \n \n Wage growth has been soft throughout the recovery, which officially began in June 2009. That has strained household budgets and damped consumer spending, slowing the pace of recovery. Average hourly earnings for all private nonfarm employees was essentially flat last month. Wages are now growing at an annualized rate of only 2 percent, barely keeping earners ahead of inflation this year. \n \n Other key findings from the Fed survey:",

    "document": "The Supreme Court won't get involved in a death penalty case in which a convicted killer in Illinois complained that prosecutors focused the jury's attention on the fact that he never testified on his own behalf. \n \n The court did not comment on its action Monday to leave in place the conviction and sentence of Ronald Mikos, a foot doctor who was facing allegations of Medicare fraud. He was sentenced to death in 2005 on charges that he shot a disabled nurse and former patient, Joyce Brannon, to keep her from testifying against him. \n \n He did not testify in his own defense during his trial. His lawyers said prosecutors told the jury his decision not to testify showed a lack of remorse for what he did. During the penalty phase, the jury said his lack of remorse contributed to the decision to sentence him to death. \n \n Mikos's lawyer said his silence did not show a lack of remorse and objected to the prosecution's tactic of using it against him. \n \n The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago upheld the sentence. \n \n The case is Mikos v. United States, 08-1280. ||||| Federal prosecutors announced Friday they will seek the death penalty for a former University of Illinois graduate student accused of kidnapping, torturing and killing a visiting scholar from China in June. \n \n In making the announcement, prosecutors alleged for the first time that Brendt Christensen \u201cchoked and sexually assaulted\u201d another victim in 2013 in central Illinois. He also has claimed \u201cadditional victims\u201d and expressed a \u201cdesire to be known as a killer,\u201d according to prosecutors. \n \n Christensen, 28, who is being held without bond, had tentatively been set to go to trial Feb. 27 in federal court in Urbana on a charge of kidnapping resulting in a death stemming from the disappearance of 26-year-old Yingying Zhang, whose body has not been found. \n \n The decision to seek the death penalty \u2014 which required the approval of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2014 means that the trial will likely be delayed for months. \n \n The death penalty was abolished in Illinois state court in 2011 after years of allegations of deep flaws in the state\u2019s justice system. In certain cases, though, it remains a tool for federal prosecutors, but its use in federal courts is still rare. It also can take years for an execution to actually be carried out. \n \n The last person to be sentenced to death in a federal courtroom in Illinois was Dr. Ronald Mikos, who was convicted in 2005 in Chicago of murdering a former patient to keep her from testifying against him in a Medicare fraud trial. \n \n Mikos, 69, whose appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied nearly a decade ago, is still awaiting execution in federal prison in Terre Haute, Ind., federal records show. \n \n The announcement in Christensen\u2019s case marks at least the third time in recent weeks that Sessions has opted to push for the death penalty. Earlier this month, it was revealed prosecutors would seek the death penalty against Billy Arnold, an alleged gang member accused of killing two rivals in Michigan. In December, Sessions greenlighted pursuit of the death penalty against Jarvis Wayne Madison, a Florida man who allegedly kidnapped and killed his estranged wife. \n \n In their five-page motion Friday, prosecutors said the death penalty was warranted because Christensen \u201cis likely to commit criminal acts of violence in the future that would constitute a continuing and serious threat to the lives and safety of others.\u201d \n \n No details of the alleged 2013 sexual assault by Christensen were provided other than the initials of the victim, \u201cM.D.\u201d The alleged assault occurred the year Christensen was admitted to the university\u2019s highly competitive physics graduate program. \n \n Four years later, Zhang's sudden disappearance rattled the U. of I. campus and sent shock waves throughout China. \n \n Zhang, who began her research appointment last April, tried unsuccessfully to flag down a bus before walking to another stop the afternoon of June 9. Shortly after, federal authorities allege, Christensen approached Zhang in his black Saturn Astra sedan and lured her inside. \n \n Surveillance video from a nearby parking garage captured the exchange in which Zhang could be seen speaking to the driver for several moments before getting into the front passenger seat. \n \n The investigation focused on Christensen after police concluded his Saturn was the car seen in the video. He initially told the FBI he was home all day playing video games on the day Zhang disappeared. \n \n Yingying Zhang, 26, a visiting scholar at the University of Illinois, has been missing since June 9, 2017. Authorities say she is presumed dead. Brendt Christensen, 28, has been charged with kidnapping Zhang. \n \n When he was questioned a second time, Christensen changed his story, telling agents he got the date mixed up, according to court records. He said he was driving on campus, came across an Asian woman looking distressed and offered her a ride because she said she was late to an appointment, authorities said. Christensen said the woman panicked after he made a wrong turn, and he let her out of his car a few blocks from where they met, prosecutors said. \n \n Meanwhile, police searched Christensen\u2019s car and determined that the area where Zhang would have been sitting had been cleaned in a way to conceal evidence, according to prosecutors. Police also searched his phone and found visits to a sadomasochism fetish website with discussion threads on kidnapping fantasies, prosecutors said. \n \n On June 29, Christensen attended a campus rally for Zhang with a girlfriend, who unbeknownst to him was wearing an FBI wire. He was captured on audio recordings describing his \"ideal victim\" as he pointed out people in the crowd, prosecutors have previously said. \n \n Other recordings made that day captured Christensen admitting to having kidnapped Zhang and describing how she fought back as he held her against her will, according to prosecutors. \n \n Earlier this week, a defense filing revealed that a few hours before Zhang\u2019s kidnapping, a female U. of I. graduate student reported to police that a man wearing aviator sunglasses had pulled up to her in a black sedan and flashed a badge. She refused to get in the car and he drove off. \n \n A few days later, the woman picked out Christensen\u2019s photo from among six shown her by the FBI, but Christensen\u2019s lawyers are seeking to block the testimony, saying she couldn\u2019t be certain because of the sunglasses. \n \n She did say that of the six photos, Christensen \"shared the most characteristics\" of the man because of his \"short, dark hair and tan face,\" the filing said. \n \n jmeisner@chicagotribune.com \n \n Twitter @jmetr22b \n \n RELATED: Earlier abduction attempt reported on day Chinese scholar went missing at U. of I. \u00bb \n \n Parents of missing Chinese scholar: 'I don't know how to spend the rest of my life without my daughter' \u00bb \n \n At vigil for missing Chinese scholar, suspect talked about 'ideal victim,' prosecutor says \u00bb",

    "document": "The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act bans companies from paying foreign officials to get more business. The law has recently been targeted by lobbyists \u2014 including an arm of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce with ties to Wal-Mart \u2014 who criticize it as too broad and bad for business. \n \n The Times investigation found that Wal-Mart de Mexico paid more than $24 million in bribes to win construction permits. When a whistleblower alerted top Wal-Mart executives in 2005, they launched an investigation that found evidence of the bribery but then shut down the inquiry. The company failed to report any of the information to law enforcement at the time, the Times story said. \n \n The revelations threaten to blemish the cleaned-up image Wal-Mart has carefully put together in recent years after facing criticism that it paid workers too little and put mom-and-pop stores out of business. \n \n As officials in recent years have stepped up their enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Chamber has been pushing for the law to be scaled back. \n \n The U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, an arm of the Chamber that has been a leader in criticizing the law, listed two Wal-Mart executives as board members in its 2010 tax form: Jeff Gearhart, Wal-Mart\u2019s general counsel, and Thomas Hyde, a former Wal-Mart corporate secretary who stepped down in August 2010. \n \n Hyde was among the company executives who received initial reports of the alleged bribery in 2005, according to the Times story. \n \n \u201cWe take compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) very seriously and are committed to having a strong and effective global anti-corruption program in every country in which we operate,\u201d David Tovar, Wal-Mart\u2019s vice president of corporate communications, said in a statement Saturday. \u201cMany of the alleged activities in The New York Times article are more than six years old. If these allegations are true, it is not a reflection of who we are or what we stand for.\u201d \n \n A spokesman for Justice Department declined to comment. The people who confirmed the department\u2019s investigation spoke on the condition of anonymity because the probe is ongoing. \n \n Wal-Mart\u2019s shares slid nearly 5 percent Monday, and the company faced more questions about how much it knew about the corruption and why it did not tell authorities. Reps. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) and Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) sent a letter to Wal-Mart chief executive Michael Duke requesting an in-person meeting about the bribery allegations. \n \n Labor critics again raised alarms about the company\u2019s practices. \n \n \u201cThe reported cover-up by Walmart executives at the highest levels exposes a core truth: Walmart cannot be taken at its word,\u201d Joe Hansen, international president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, said in statement. \n \n One in five Wal-Mart stores is in Mexico. Wal-Mart de Mexico is the company\u2019s largest foreign subsidiary. \n \n Staff writer Tom Hamburger contributed to this report. ||||| Stock Chart for Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB de CV (WALMEXV) \n \n Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) is the subject of a U.S. Justice Department criminal investigation into allegations of bribery in its Mexican subsidiary, according to a person familiar with the probe. \n \n The Justice Department is investigating potential criminal charges under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, according to the person familiar with the probe who wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly about it. Wal-Mart is conducting its own review of allegations that its representatives paid local officials in Mexico to get stores opened faster in the early 2000s. \n \n The investigations by the government and the company may prompt executive departures and U.S. penalties if it reveals senior managers didn\u2019t take strong enough action, governance specialists said. The probes also may slow Wal-Mart\u2019s expansion in Mexico and other markets. \n \n \u201cThe penalties paid by companies in settling these types of FCPA investigations have grown significantly larger in recent years,\u201d said Jeffrey Lehtman, a Washington-based partner with the law firm of Richards Kibbe & Orbe LLP. \u201cDepending on the facts uncovered, companies like Wal-Mart can expect the penalties to be incredibly high.\u201d \n \n The bribery allegations were described in an April 21 New York Times story. In a December 2011 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Wal-Mart said it was examining whether it was in compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, without saying what region or time period was in question. \n \n \u201cIt is an open question as to whether Wal-Mart\u2019s prior disclosure would have allowed investors to understand the magnitude of potential exposure,\u201d said Lehtman, whose firm handles Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases. \n \n \u2018Anti-Corruption Program\u2019 \n \n Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined to comment. John Nester, an SEC spokesman, declined to comment earlier yesterday on whether the agency plans to investigate the Wal-Mart allegations. \n \n The company said in an April 21 statement that it has met voluntarily with the Justice Department and the SEC to discuss the case. The company is also enhancing its audit procedures and internal controls to escalate to management possible violations of the bribery law. \n \n Jeff Gearhart, the company\u2019s general counsel and corporate secretary, told employees in an April 21 memo that the alleged violations \u201coccurred more than six years ago\u201d and are \u201cnot a reflection of who we are or what we stand for.\u201d \n \n In a separate note sent to employees yesterday, Chief Executive Officer Mike Duke said Wal-Mart is conducting an \u201caggressive investigation\u201d and \u201cwill not tolerate violations anywhere or at any level of the company.\u201d David Tovar, a company spokesman, confirmed the authenticity of both documents. \n \n Mexican Expansion \n \n The expansion of Wal-Mart de Mexico, mainly in the last decade, left the world\u2019s largest retailer with about 20 percent of its stores in Mexico, out of more than 10,000 worldwide. Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart\u2019s sales rose about 6 percent last year to $447 billion. Wal-Mart has more than doubled the number of stores in Mexico to 2,088 since 2008. \n \n The investigation may slow Wal-Mart\u2019s growth in the country if authorities there feel pressure to show more scrutiny of its permits, Robert Carroll, an analyst at UBS AG in New York, said yesterday in a report. \n \n Wal-Mart de Mexico, which is 69 percent owned by Wal-Mart Stores Inc., fell 12 percent yesterday to 37.89 pesos in Mexico City, the biggest decline since May 4, 1998. The parent company\u2019s shares slid 4.7 percent to $59.54 at the close in New York, the biggest drop since Aug. 10. \n \n Conference Call \n \n Walmex\u2019s first-quarter net income rose 4.5 percent to 4.71 billion pesos ($357 million) from 4.5 billion a year earlier, the company said in a statement. Sales climbed 14 percent to 96.9 billion pesos, missing the average estimate of 99.7 billion pesos of five analysts polled by Bloomberg. \n \n Walmex CEO Scot Rank and Chief Financial Officer Rafael Matute didn\u2019t mention the corruption investigation yesterday on a seven-minute conference call to discuss first-quarter results. As usual, the company didn\u2019t take questions from analysts or investors on the quarterly call. \n \n Settlements involving the corrupt practices act are typically 1 percent to 2 percent of sales, and that would be about $4.5 billion per 1 percentage point of sales for Wal-Mart, Carroll said. FCPA investigations take 2 years to 6 years to settle, he said. The largest such settlement ever was $1.6 billion paid by Siemens AG (SIE) in 2008, he said. \n \n Wal-Mart executives, including then-Chief Executive Officer and current board member Lee Scott, were made aware of the bribery allegations in 2005, the New York Times reported. So was Duke, the current CEO, who at the end of that year was just taking over international operations, the article said. \n \n Scott didn\u2019t return a phone call to his home. \n \n Congressional Scrutiny \n \n Two top Democrats on congressional panels yesterday moved to start a probe and request a meeting with Wal-Mart executives. \n \n The Times report \u201craises serious questions about potential violations of United States law\u201d and \u201cabout the actions of top company officials in the United States who reportedly tried to disregard substantial evidence of abuse,\u201d Representatives Elijah Cummings of Maryland and Henry Waxman of California, wrote in a letter to Duke. \n \n Cummings is the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and Waxman is the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. \n \n Wal-Mart will face pressure from shareholders to take action against any executives who didn\u2019t act fully on the bribery allegations sooner, said Charles Elson, director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. \n \n \u2018It\u2019s Problematic\u2019 \n \n \u201cIf this is all true, it\u2019s problematic,\u201d Elson said in a telephone interview. \u201cIf any officer was significantly involved, their position has to be reviewed. You have to do the investigating and determine what did the CEO know and when.\u201d \n \n The Times article said the bribes may have amounted to more than $24 million in payments. \n \n The Times identified executive Eduardo Castro-Wright as a central figure in the expansion of the alleged payments. Castro- Wright ran Wal-Mart de Mexico as CEO from 2003 to 2005 and was president and chief operating officer of the unit from 2001 to 2003. Some of the alleged bribery took place during that time, the newspaper reported. \n \n In a telephone interview, Tovar declined to discuss the future of Castro-Wright, who is now a Wal-Mart vice chairman scheduled to retire July 1. \n \n To contact the reporters on this story: David Welch in Detroit at dwelch12@bloomberg.net; Thom Weidlich in New York at tweidlich@bloomberg.net; Seth Stern in Washington at sstern14@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editors responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net; Steven Komarow at skomarow1@bloomberg.net",

Gawker reported it is model Matthew James McCarthy, whose photo is one of the top Google images results for \"random guy.\" \n \n Another reason people are linking the profile to Duggar is that the user last appeared online in Sept. 2014, which is approximately the same time Duggar's reported credit card stopped paying for the first of his Ashley Madison accounts. Duggar was the executive director of the Family Research Council, and this user lists his occupation as \"politics.\" \n \n Joesmithsonnwa also said he is a Christian who never smokes, drinks or does drugs.

And as of right now, it appears on Wordpress under the title \u201crandom guy from Facebook.\u201d If you search \u201crandom guy\u201d on Google images, the same photo comes up as one of the very first results. So if a man in his 20s were to try and find a discreet, anonymous photo for a social media profile, it\u2019s possible he\u2019d find this one. \n \n It\u2019s also worth noting that, on this OKCupid profile, \u201cJoesmithsonnwa\u201d claims to be looking for \u201ccasual sex\u201d while simultaneously describing himself as a \u201cstrictly monogamous\u201d type. \u201cJoesmithsonnwa\u201d last appeared online in September of 2014 (around the same time Josh J Duggar\u2019s credit card stopped paying for the first Ashley Madison account), and \u201cJoesmithsonnwa\u201d lists his location as near where Duggar, his wife, and their three children lived in Oxon Hill, Maryland\u2014that is, until they moved back to Arkansas when scandal hit. \n \n What\u2019s more, his occupation is listed as \u201cpolitics,\u201d and Duggar was the Executive Director of the Family Research Council at the same time this profile was active. \n \n On the other hand, the man in this profile lists himself as having \u201cgraduated from university,\u201d where as Josh did not, in fact, graduate college. It is, however, very, very rare that a Google search for one phrase only turns up one other link, but we also don\u2019t have any credit card data to corroborate this particular 27-year-old casual-sex-seeker\u2019s identity. \n \n So while we can\u2019t determine definitively that this is Josh, if you did go out with this person at any point and it was not Josh Duggar (or if you are \u201crandom guy from Facebook), we\u2019d love to hear from you. \n \n Update 8/20 10:59 a.m.: Whoever did own the OkCupid profile has apparently decided to delete it.

So again, if you have any more information about this\u2014or any other similar dating profile\u2014you can send us an email here. \n \n Correction: An earlier version of this incorrectly referred to Josh Duggar\u2019s Ashley Madison username as \u201cjoesmithsonnwa,\u201d when \u201cjoesmithsonnwa@gmail.com\u201d was actually his Ashley Madison login.

But the school had planned a freshman class of approximately 6,250 students. \n \n Students complained on social media that the university over-enrolled and used any excuse to trim its number. \n \n UCI\u2019s Parham acknowledged \u201cmissteps\u201d but emphasized that all students \u201cwho meet the terms and conditions of the admissions offer will be welcomed into the Anteater family. \n \n \u201cNo acceptance will be withdrawn due to over-enrollment, despite external reports to the contrary,\u201d Parham wrote. \n \n Related Articles UCI rescinds 500 admission offers, student leaders demand apology \n \n UC system says it\u2019s on track to increase number of California freshmen enrolled Many of the prospective students who saw their offers rescinded said that either the university or their high school made mistakes. And those errors, they said, have caused them a lot of anxiety. \n \n Johnny Wang, 18, of Glendale, is appealing. UCI withdrew his offer of admission because it didn\u2019t receive a transcript from his high school. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s been confusing and sad for me,\u201d said Wang, who graduated from La Canada High School with a weighted grade-point average topping 4.3. \n \n Simran Chopra, 18, of Los Angeles, said that she locked herself in a bathroom and cried when she learned of the withdrawal. Chopra said she has proof that her transcript was sent via certified mail before the July 1 deadline. \n \n \u201cThis was really heartbreaking for me,\u201d said Chopra, who chose UCI over UC Berkeley because she\u2019s a fan of the Irvine school\u2019s Bollywood dance team. \n \n While students were told that their appeals could take four to six weeks, UCI has increased the number of people reviewing appeals, and those already on appeal will be expedited and are expected to be completed by the end of next week, Vasich said late Friday. \n \n For Julia Kim, 18, of Claremont, it\u2019s too late. \n \n Kim, who took a bevy of advanced classes and racked up a 4.3 grade-point average in high school, wanted to go to UCI to stay close to her family. \n \n \u201cI listed a course as a computer class on my application but because the name was called technical education, they didn\u2019t think it was a computer class,\u201d Kim said. \n \n With less than two months before school starts, Kim didn\u2019t want to wait until the last minute to find out whether her appeal would be approved. She considered community college or taking a gap year.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Admissions goofs are nothing new. Learning you've lost your admission in July is another matter. That's the situation with the University of California Irvine, which withdrew 499 offers of admission two months before the fall term is to begin. By the Los Angeles Times' count, that's abnormally high: Other UC campuses gave \"recession\" numbers ranging from seven to 150. Per the school, 290 of the reversals were because of transcript issues; the rest were over low senior-year grades. Many of the newly disappointed are accusing the school of fishing for slight or even unsubstantiated reasons to dump would-be freshmen after too many made the choice to enroll. The LAT cites numbers that suggest they may not be off base: The UC Office of the President says 7,100 students made the decision to enroll, versus a planned freshman class of 6,250.

Since then, Marc, Debra and the Tice family have endured three consecutive Christmases without their son and brother. This will be the fourth. The Tices hope t ||||| The families of four American hostages who were killed while in Islamic State custody issued a joint letter Wednesday imploring the Obama administration to \u201cuse all appropriate means\u201d to find and return missing U.S. journalist Austin Tice. \n \n Tice is the last unaccounted-for American reporter in the Syrian civil war; he was abducted by unknown gunmen in August 2012 and has been incommunicado ever since. Tice\u2019s parents have asked the White House to step up search efforts, with their calls sounding increasingly urgent as the clock runs out on the Obama administration\u2019s final term. \n \n State Department spokesman John Kirby said U.S. officials are working through the Czech government, the U.S. protecting power because the U.S. embassy in Damascus is shuttered, to find information on Tice\u2019s \u201cwelfare and whereabouts.\u201d Kirby said officials are in regular contact with families of U.S. detainees overseas, but that privacy considerations prevented him from saying more about Tice. \n \n \u201cWe are deeply concerned about the well-being of Austin Tice,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cHis case has the attention of the highest levels in the U.S. government and the administration.\u201d \n \n The letter the Tices released Wednesday bore the names of the slain hostages\u2019 parents \u2013 a raw reminder of search efforts that didn\u2019t find captives in time. They represented journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and humanitarian aid workers Abdul-Rahman Peter Kassig and Kayla Mueller. \n \n The Islamic State beheaded Foley, Sotloff and Kassig in gruesome propaganda videos. Mueller, who reportedly was enslaved and assaulted for months by Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, died in a coalition strike, apparently an inadvertent casualty of the U.S.-led campaign targeting the Islamic State\u2019s so-called caliphate in Iraq and Syria. \n \n We are four families bonded together by tragedy and terror. . . . But there is something that still can be done: Bring Austin Tice safely home. Open letter to President Obama \n \n The Tices got to know the other families when they united to lobby for changes in hostage policy \u2013 they were at the White House together a year ago this week when President Barack Obama announced a revamped process based on the families\u2019 recommendations. \n \n \u201cWe are four families bonded together by tragedy and terror. We will never fully recover from the horrific outcome of our own hostage crisis,\u201d the families of the slain captives wrote in the joint letter. \u201cBut there is something that still can be done: Bring Austin Tice safely home.\u201d \n \n Neither the Tices nor the other families named specific steps the Obama administration could take to find Tice and win his release. They alluded to diplomatic efforts and urged officials not \u201cto hesitate in leveraging all appropriate means.\u201d The parents also chided Obama for failing to mention Tice \u2013 the only U.S. journalist in captivity in the world \u2013 during his high-profile speech at the annual White House Correspondents Association dinner April 30. \n \n Austin Tice is the only American journalist being held captive in the world. \n \n \u201cWe are not asking the White House to put anyone in harm\u2019s way, nor compromise national security,\u201d the families wrote. \u201cWe are asking the president, fully within the responsibilities and obligations of his office, to put aside any personal or election year concern, to engage boldly and to use all appropriate means to bring Austin Tice safely home as soon as possible.\u201d \n \n The families gave wrenching testimonials about having a loved one held hostage in Syria. \n \n Mueller\u2019s parents and brother, Carl, Marsha and Eric, wrote that they are \u201chaunted every day\u201d and urged the government not to repeat what they deemed as missed opportunities and \u201cthe deadly silence that cost all the hostages their lives.\u201d \n \n Foley\u2019s parents, Diane and John, told Obama that they\u2019re counting on him to keep the promises he made \u201cafter the horrific execution of our son.\u201d Kassig\u2019s parents, Ed and Paula, said they\u2019re \u201cdevastated by the loss of our son, but the pain will be slightly lessened\u201d if his death spurred the government to act urgently to bring Tice home. \n \n Shirley and Arthur Sotloff were even more direct. \n \n \u201cWe, the family of the late journalist Steven Sotloff, remind President Obama of the following: You told us in person that if it were your daughters, you would do anything in your power to bring them home,\u201d they wrote. \u201cWe implore you: Bring Austin Tice home.\u201d \n \n EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE \n \n Tice, now 34, a U.S. Marine-turned-journalist who reported for outlets including McClatchy and The Washington Post, vanished in Syria in mid-August 2012. Apart from a video clip showing him in the custody of unknown gunmen shortly after his disappearance, there\u2019s been no confirmed sighting of Tice since. \n \n Unlike the other American captives, Tice is widely believed to have been seized by loyalists of the Syrian regime \u2013 not by the Islamic State. Damascus denies any knowledge of his whereabouts. This August will mark his fourth year in apparent detention. \n \n The parents of the hostages closed their letter of support by recognizing the Tice family\u2019s anguish. They, too, know how \u201cit requires mountain-moving faith to maintain hope as the crisis continues.\u201d \n \n \u201cWith unwavering hope, Austin\u2019s parents do not give up,\u201d the families wrote. \u201cThe United States government must not give up.\u201d ||||| Fresno Democratic Congressman Jim Costa voted twice to support Saudi Arabia\u2019s war in Yemen while taking campaign cash from oil and gas companies.

Valve, the company that runs Steam, has now removed the game from its online storefront, Deadline reports.

Through a score counter, the game tracked \"civ killed\" and \"cops killed.\" The developer defended the game, arguing that it \"does not promote any sort of violence, especially any soft shooters.\" But it also said that there are worse games out there (\"Hatred, Postal, Carmageddon and etc.\") that do not promote violence. \"We are not going to do business with people who act like this towards our customers or Valve,\" a Valve spokesperson tells Deadline. \"The broader conversation about Steam's content policies is one that we \u2013 A video game being developed by a company owned by Amazon's Jeff Bezos is drawing condemnation for its depiction of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, the Washington Post reports.

    "document": "MINNEAPOLIS -- The 2014 All-Star Game was one big love poem to Derek Jeter, and National League starting pitcher Adam Wainwright did more than any other player on the premises to advance the feel-good storyline. \n \n As Jeter strolled toward home plate in the bottom of the first inning, Wainwright laid his glove on the mound, took a walk toward second base and joined in the wall-to-wall applause at Target Field. When Jeter finally dug his left toe in the box and got down to business, the pitcher-batter staredown turned into a test of wills. \n \n \"He told me, 'Let's go,' and I told him no,\" Wainwright said later. \"It's the only time I'll ever tell Derek Jeter no.\" \n \n So it was almost impossible to comprehend how Wainwright's show of respect would quickly be forgotten, a celebration would elicit controversy, and the pitcher's well-intentioned mix of candor and good humor would somehow brand him as the villain of the evening. In this age of instant information dissemination and rapid reactions, Wainwright learned the hard way that too much honesty can turn a stand-up guy into a Twitter pi\u00f1ata. \n \n Before throwing a pitch, Adam Wainwright put his glove on the rubber and stepped back to let Derek Jeter have a moment. Rob Carr/Getty Images \n \n Shortly after giving up an opposite-field double to Jeter, a triple to Mike Trout and a home run to Miguel Cabrera that helped propel the American League to a 5-3 victory over the National League, Wainwright inadvertently stepped in it big-time. While reflecting on Jeter's at-bat, he provided one detail too many. \n \n \"I was going to give him a couple of pipe shots,\" Wainwright said. \"He deserved it. I didn't know he was going to hit a double or I would have changed my mind. I thought he was going to hit something hard to the right side for a single or an out. I probably should have pitched him a little bit better.\" \n \n Chances are the negative fallout from the event will blow over relatively quickly. But this much is certain: Wainwright's biggest claim to fame in New York will no longer be freezing Mets outfielder Carlos Beltran with a curveball in the ninth inning of Game 7 in the 2006 National League Championship Series. \n \n Wainwright will undoubtedly be subjected to his share of criticism over the coming days. He will be accused of raining on Jeter's parade, of cheapening the Captain's moment and of undermining the integrity of the All-Star Game. He understands that better than anyone, which is why he spent the better part of 10 minutes after the game flogging himself for his bad judgment. \n \n He referred to himself as a \"knucklehead\" and an \"idiot\" while simultaneously expressing regret that his choice of words might have taken away from Jeter's big moment. \n \n \"If I'm going to get taken to the slaughterhouse for saying a stupid phrase, then I deserve it,\" Wainwright said. \"If you can't laugh at yourself when you mess up, then you're going to continue to mess up. And you know what? I messed up. But I didn't try to let him get a hit. I messed up by speaking afterward.\" \n \n For all the mixed messages and confusion that Wainwright elicited Tuesday, he probably did Major League Baseball a favor by exposing the massive problems inherent with what the All-Star Game has become in recent years. If there were any doubt, commissioner Bud Selig's \"This One Counts\" initiative has outlived its usefulness and needs to be put to rest before the 2015 All-Star Game in Cincinnati. \n \n It has been 11 years since MLB began awarding home-field advantage in the World Series to the AL or NL team based on the outcome of the All-Star Game, and Selig maintains that the system has achieved its purpose by elevating a quaint midsummer exhibition into must-see summer viewing. If raising the stakes can increase the suspense and prompt more viewers to tune in to the game, that's obviously a good thing. And as Selig is fond of saying, the old system of alternating home-field advantage between leagues from one year to the next wasn't exactly \"Einstein's theory of relativity.\" \n \n After putting Derek Jeter on base, it wasn't long before Adam Wainwright had reason to regret it. Scott Rovak/USA TODAY Sports \n \n But as the Wainwright-Jeter flap shows, the system has way too many pitfalls and minefields to be viable anymore. \n \n MLB can't attach paramount importance to the All-Star Game when fans elect the starters, players have a say in the process, managers round out the rosters, and fans have yet another say in the Internet Final Vote. There are just too many constituencies to satisfy, and the voting becomes one big hash. \n \n If home-field advantage in the World Series is at stake, every team should not have a representative, as is the custom, and the best players need to stick around for the long haul rather than make cameos. A prime example is Trout, who would have played all nine innings Tuesday instead of exiting in the sixth inning with a double, a triple and two RBIs in three at-bats. \n \n And while this might seem sacrilegious, you can debate whether Jeter should have even been playing in the All-Star Game this year if it were strictly about winning. Of the 12 American League shortstops who qualify for the batting title, Jeter ranks 11th with a .647 OPS -- ahead of only Seattle's Brad Miller. Jeter deserved to be in Minneapolis for his class, fan appeal and overall body of work, and it would have been a crime for fans to miss a chance to say goodbye to him. But even a die-hard Yankees rooter might have trouble justifying Jeter batting leadoff for the AL squad if this were strictly about \"This One Counts.\" \n \n Some Yankees fans will claim that Wainwright's \"pipe shot\" phrase was disrespectful to Jeter because it implied that The Captain couldn't have gotten a hit without a helping hand. If so, they're a lot more sensitive than Jeter, who was content to let things slide when informed of Wainwright's comments after the game. \n \n \"If he grooved it, thank you,\" Jeter said. \"You still have to hit it.\" \n \n That's the perspective and self-assurance of a man who has 3,408 hits and five World Series rings on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and knows that he will be going to the Hall of Fame on the first ballot. \n \n The flap over Wainwright's grooved pitch reflects the changing mindset that linking World Series home-field advantage has wrought. When Chan Ho Park allegedly grooved a pitch to Cal Ripken Jr. in the Iron Man's final All-Star appearance in 2001, it was perceived as more a sign of generosity than a major breach of etiquette. But then, if Park did feed Ripken a \"pipe shot,\" he at least had the good sense to keep quiet about it. \n \n Sometimes the line between showmanship and winning tends to blur at the All-Star Game. Two years ago, Justin Verlander gave up five runs in the first inning of the AL's 8-0 loss in Kansas City and admitted that he wanted to light up the radar gun. \n \n \"I know this game means something,\" Verlander said at the time, \"but we're here for the fans, and I know the fans don't want to see me throw 90 [mph] and hit the corners. Just let it eat and have fun.\" \n \n Wainwright's biggest sin, in contrast, was trying to balance competition, respect for a distinguished elder and his natural inclination to avoid conducting media interviews like a garden-variety baseball robot. In exchange for spreading himself too thin, he almost blew up Twitter. \n \n \"People in New York already don't like me, so anything else I say will just fuel the fire there,\" Wainwright said before leaving Target Field. \"I should probably hush up.\" \n \n It's a little late for that. But if Wainwright's experience at the 2014 All-Star Game can prompt MLB to take a hard look at the event and what it should be, maybe his long, emotional night in Minnesota will have been worth it.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Last night was Derek Jeter's last All Star Game, and it went beautifully, as the Yankee captain went 2-for-2 with a double. There was just one problem: That double might have been a gimme.

The girlfriend asked her brother John Truong to watch the 2-year old, and Truong was the one to call police once he realized who he had in his care. \n \n The girlfriend, identified by a Des Moines police spokesman as Alyssa Chang, allegedly brought the 2-year-old boy to her brother's house to have him babysit the child. \n \n On Tuesday night, Chang told her brother, John Truong, that the toddler was her boyfriend's son, police said. Truong said he didn't realize anything was awry until Wednesday morning when he saw an Amber Alert about the alleged kidnapping on social media. \n \n \"I'm eating my breakfast, I'm checking my , all of a sudden I see this Amber Alert for this child and it looks like this child in my bed, and I'm like, 'Oh, my God! What's going on?'\" John Truong told ABC affiliate KOMO-TV in Seattle. \n \n \"It was my sister who had asked me as a favor to watch her boyfriend's son. And that's how he came and was dropped off.\u201d \n \n The suspected kidnapping was only part of the alleged crime that police were trying to solve at the time, because both the boy and his mother had allegedly been abducted by Chang and the boy's paternal grandmother, identified by police as Vien Nguyen. \n \n Police say the incident unfolded early Tuesday afternoon in Des Moines when the child\u2019s grandmother Nguyen, 65, and Chang, 46, arrived at a home and allegedly abducted both the child and his mother, whose name has not been released. \n \n In order to subdue the child's mother, police say, either Nguyen or Chang allegedly struck her with a stun gun before trying her up and driving her and the toddler to another home in a town 20 miles away in the town of Fife, Des Moines police Sgt. Mike Graddon told ABC News. \n \n KOMO \n \n Once they arrived at the home in Fife, the women allegedly retied the child\u2019s mother in the garage and took the child into the house. Police say the child\u2019s mother was able to get out of the ties but not into the house, so she ran to a neighbor\u2019s home. \n \n Rather than immediately call police, however, investigators say she called a relative. It was not until about 9:00 p.m. when police were notified and they sent out an Amber alert. \n \n When the child\u2019s mother spoke to investigators, she was able to identify both of the suspects, authorities say, but the case is still under investigation. \n \n \"There\u2019s a lot of family dynamics involved,\" Sgt. Graddon told ABC News. \"As far as why, we can only speculate.\" \n \n Police were only able to locate the child the next morning, however, when Chang\u2019s brother called after seeing the Amber Alert online. \n \n After Truong contacted police, they were able to secure the boy, who was unharmed. From there, they were able to locate Chang and the car used in the alleged abduction at the Fife home that the child\u2019s mother had directed police to during her initial 911 call. \n \n The boy\u2019s father, Kang Tran, met with police Wednesday morning before the boy was found, police said. After hours of interviews, he was not charged in connection to the incident, police say. \n \n The boy was reunited with his mother and his father Wednesday afternoon. \n \n Chang was taken into police custody and Nguyen turned herself in later Wednesday. Police say both face three felony charges: kidnapping, felony assault, and unlawful imprisonment. \n \n Police Sgt. Graddon told ABC News Chang is still in police custody but Nguyen was fingerprinted and released for medical reasons. \n \n \"We\u2019re still trying to make sense of this whole thing,\" he said. \n \n ABC News has been unable to reach the suspects.

It can be found throughout Washington, from the Lincoln Memorial to tombstones at Congressional Cemetery, and around the world, from Hadrian's Villa in Italy to Angkor Wat in Cambodia and even on monuments in Egypt. It was successfully treated at the D.C. War Memorial in 2011. \n \n \n \n \n \n While the study of the relationship of biofilms on buildings and the effects of cleaning them is still young, one of the common factors in the existence of many biofilms is the presence of nutrients and a place to grow, like stone. At the Jefferson Memorial, perhaps the most significant factor in its development is the erosion of the marble through natural weathering. The marble blocks that make up the Jefferson Memorial were smooth when they were originally hoisted into position, but over the years, rain has slowly eroded the marble, turning its once smooth surfaces into pitted surfaces \u2013the perfect environment for a biofilm. \n \n \n \n \n \n The black biofilm on the Jefferson Memorial first became noticeable in 2006 and has become increasingly more pronounced in recent years. A multi-disciplinary team of conservators, architects, and molecular biologists has been studying the growth on the Jefferson Memorial since 2014 as they prepare to test potential treatment options. \n \n \n \n \n \n \"Treatment of biofilm is difficult, as there is no known permanent method for removing it, and we have to ensure that any treatment must not do further damage to the soft marble of the memorial nor encourage further growth,\" said Catherine Dewey, chief of resource management for National Mall and Memorial Parks. \"We are testing a variety of treatment techniques to find the option that is least damaging to the stone, safe for the environment and visitors, and cost effective.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n National Park Service officials recently began testing ten different chemical biocides in small patches affected by biofilm at the base of the Jefferson Memorial and will monitor how effective each one is in the coming days and weeks. They will also experiment with more non-traditional treatment options, including ozonated water and irradiation with lasers. \n \n \n \n \n \n There is no timeline for treatment of the dome and National Park Service officials stress that it's a deliberative process to ensure that whatever treatment is selected will do no further harm to the Jefferson Memorial. The treatment method ultimately chosen will help define the cost to restore the dome, which in turn drive the timeline for when the work will be scheduled. \n \n \n \n \n \n NPS \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n About National Mall and Memorial Parks \n \n The National Park Service's National Mall and Memorial Parks preserves, protects, and interprets the symbolic and monumental civic spaces and commemorative works in the center of the Nation's Capital that honor American ideals and values, distinguished public figures, and military and civilian sacrifices and contributions. On the National Mall these sites include the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, Thomas Jefferson Memorial, Vietnam Veterans Memorial, Korean War Veterans Memorial, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, World War II Memorial, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial. National Mall and Memorial Parks also serves as a public park and open space for active civic and cultural engagement, recreation, and public enjoyment. \n \n WASHINGTON - The dome of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial is one of the iconic landmarks on the Washington, D.C. skyline. In recent years, however, the gleaming white rotunda has become increasingly darkened, but not by dirt or mold, as the casual eye might suspect. The culprit is a colony of microscopic organisms, called biofilm, which adheres to stone surfaces and is proving a challenge as the National Park Service investigates how to treat it. ||||| National Park Service officials are preparing to work on removing the black scum coating areas of the Jefferson Memorial in Washington.

The biofilm became noticeable less than a decade ago, the Park Service said. \n \n The reason may be that air pollution, which can inhibit the growth of such organisms, has decreased, the Park Service said. \n \n Or it may have something to do with the microclimate near the memorial. \n \n There\u2019s a small weather station on top of the memorial, and data is collected monthly, said Catherine Dewey, chief of resource management for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \n \n \u201cBecause we have this huge body of water,\u201d she said, referring to the Tidal Basin, \u201cis that tiny little bit of extra humidity . . . a factor?\u201d \n \n \u201cWe have some photographs from . . . 2009 where there\u2019s very, very little growth,\u201d she said. \u201cIn 2012, you see a little bit more.

It\u2019s grown immensely over the last few years.\u201d \n \n One day last week, Dewey tested cleaning fluids on small strips at the base of the memorial\u2019s east side. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s particularly bad on this memorial, for whatever reason,\u201d she said as she sponged on the cleaning fluids. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s really deep into the stone, so it will take some time,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re finding is it may not be clean immediately. But give it six months, and it will be much lighter.\u201d \n \n Some repair work is planned for the memorial in 2018, and the grit on the dome could be addressed then, she said. \n \n The 32,000-ton memorial, which honors the nation\u2019s third president and main author of the Declaration of Independence, rests on 634 pilings and caissons sunk down to bedrock on the south side of the basin. \n \n During the annual Cherry Blossom Festival, it is a prime backdrop for photographers. \n \n Six years ago, a $12.4 million repair project shored up its poorly supported seawall, which had been sinking into the basin. \n \n And in 2014, a large chunk of limestone fell from the ceiling. The ceiling was stabilized, and netting was installed in case anything else came loose, Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst said. A full repair has not yet been done. \n \n [Jefferson Memorial seawall sinking into the Tidal Basin] \n \n The memorial turns 75 in two years.",

The NPS reports it has uncovered a \"common factor\" related to the establishment of various biofilms: the somewhat vague \"presence of nutrients and a place to grow, like stone.\" It suspects that in the case of the Jefferson Memorial, the dimples and holes that have formed in the eroding marble may create an environment ripe for biofilm. That soft marble poses an additional challenge, notes the NPS, as any treatment needs to be tested to make sure it won't actually inflict harm on the stone. While there's no known permanent removal method, the NPS is evaluating 10 chemicals as potential cleaners and intends to also review options like ozonated water and lasers.

The culprit is something called biofilm, microscopic organisms that adhere to stone surfaces and are difficult to remove, National Parks Traveler reports. \"Treatment of biofilm is difficult, as there is no known permanent method for removing it, and we have to ensure that any treatment must not do further damage to the soft marble of the memorial nor encourage further growth,\" says Catherine Dewey, chief of resource management for National Mall and Memorial Parks. \"We are testing a variety of treatment techniques to find the option that is least damaging to the stone, safe for the environment and visitors, and cost effective.\" Over the last two years, a multi-disciplinary team of conservators, architects, and molecular biologists has been studying the growth on the Jefferson Memorial as they prepare to test potential treatment options, including ozonated water and irradiation with lasers. The treatment method ultimately chosen will help define the cost to restore the dome, which in turn drive the timeline for when the work will be scheduled. \u2013 The Thomas Jefferson Memorial is awash in what the Washington Post calls \"black scum coating\" and what the National Park Service is calling \"a microbial invasion of uncertain origin.\" Part algae, part bacteria, part fungi, the biofilm won't eat your flesh, as a Park Service spokesman remarked, but it's not clear if it is munching on the stone. And it can't be killed. The biofilm is also on memorials at Arlington National Cemetery, the Washington Monument, and the Lincoln Memorial, the Park Service says. It's especially pronounced on the Jefferson Memorial's dome, around its base, and on the triangular amphitheater that portrays Jefferson and four colleagues who helped draft the Declaration of Independence. Concerned citizens have offered to try to clean it off. And the Park service is experimenting with several cleaning solutions to see what works best without harming the Vermont marble. No damaging scrub brushes can be used, although some of the cleaning products leave a temporary orange tint. Officials have also discussed cleaning with lasers. The film is actually a \"multicultural\" community of organisms living in the relatively harsh environment of the sun-blasted stone, says Federica Villa, a Milan-based microbiologist who has been studying the memorial's surface. The black pigment \u2013 The National Mall's most-visited monument may be in need of some serious TLC after a buildup of bacteria and other microorganisms turned the stone of the George Washington Memorial black, the Washington Post reports. \"It's really deep into the stone, so it will take some time,\" says Catherine Dewey, who heads resource management for the National Mall and Memorial Parks. \"What we're finding is it may not be clean immediately. But give it six months, and it will be much lighter.\" The National Park Service, which runs the mall, has been collecting data on the condition of the memorial, which was dedicated in 1943, since 2009. In 2009, there was \"very, very little growth,\" Dewey says. \"In 2012, you see a little bit more. In 2014, it's even worse.\" Now, \"it's particularly bad on this memorial, for whatever reason,\" she says. The Park Service says air pollution may be to blame, but there's also extra humidity in the Tidal Basin, where the memorial sits. \"Because we have this huge body of water,\" Dewey tells the Post, \"is that tiny little bit of extra humidity ... a factor?\" Some repair work is planned for the memorial in 2018, and the grit on the dome could",

    "document": "Will we have the first American sitcom with openly HIV-positive star? Charlie Sheen, who yesterday publicly acknowledged his condition following a National Enquirer report, had been looking to topline another primetime comedy series. In the weeks leading to the admission, Sheen had been actively meeting with producers about developing a new half-hour starring vehicle for him. I hear among those Sheen reached out to and had meetings with were CBS TV Studios-based Eric Tannenbaum, who executive produced Sheen\u2019s hugely successful CBS sitcom Two And A Half Men as well as executives from Sony Pictures TV. I hear nothing came out of the sit-downs, and there is no Sheen series set up at the moment. \n \n During the Today interview yesterday, Sheen indicated that he has major projects in the hopper, including several features, and was confident that his HIV-positive status will not have an impact on his career. He pointed to his talks at Sony TV, noting that chairman Steve Mosko was \u201cexcited about doing a show again\u201d with him. \u201cThus far, there\u2019s been no resistance,\u201d Sheen said. It is yet to be seen whether any potential lawsuits by sexual partners from the four years he had kept his condition a secret would change that. \n \n Sheen had been HIV-positive during the entire run of his previous sitcom, Anger Management. According to his own account, he was diagnosed in 2011, around the time he was pitching the project. It is unclear whether the actor revealed his condition to Lionsgate TV/Debmar-Mercury, which signed on to produce the show, and FX, which picked it up to series. Sources indicate that many if not all cast and crew members on the show were not aware Sheen was HIV-positive, at least not in the beginning. According to tabloid reports, Sheen\u2019s colleagues became suspicious when production was shut down multiple times over the star\u2019s health problems. A leaked email from the Sony hack indicates that top Sony TV executives and likely other industry types outside the studio were aware of the actor\u2019s condition by early 2014. \n \n Still, despite his 2011 public meltdown that led to his firing from 2.5 Men and heavy drug and alcohol abuse to which Sheen has confessed, most recently in the Today interview, he was able to complete 100 episodes of Anger Management in 2.5 years and is looking for a follow-up series. That would be his fourth sitcom, following Spin City, 2.5 Men and Anger Management. ||||| \n \n Charlie Sheen on \u201cAnger Management.\u201d (Greg Gayne/FX) \n \n Apparently lost in the massive Sony e-mail hack that wreaked havoc on Hollywood last winter: this e-mail sent to several Sony Pictures Television executives in March 2014: \n \n \u201cI think I will win the 90/10 bet on the over under on this \u2026 it\u2019s hard to to be a drug addict and be HIV positive and do 40 eps a year.\u201d \n \n Included was a link to a TV Week article about how Charlie Sheen was a no-show on the set of his FX series \u201cAnger Management,\u201d and crew members were so frustrated they were threatening to quit. \n \n The hacked e-mail amounts to a tasteless joke by an executive, saying that he didn\u2019t expect Sheen to reach the 100-episode mark that would send \u201cAnger Management\u201d into syndication (and create a lucrative windfall for all involved). The 90/10 refers to the \u201cAnger Management\u201d deal that said if 10 episodes did well in the ratings, FX would pick up 90 more. As a reminder, Sheen landed the series, which aired from June 2012 to December 2014, after he imploded and was fired from CBS\u2019s \u201cTwo and a Half Men.\u201d The conventional wisdom at the time was that Sheen, known for erratic behavior, would be able to hold it together for 100 \u201cAnger Management\u201d episodes shot in just a couple years. (The show filmed exactly 100 episodes.) \n \n [Charlie Sheen says he\u2019s HIV-positive, has been extorted for $10 million over diagnosis] \n \n The e-mail indicates that Sheen\u2019s HIV diagnosis was no secret to some in the entertainment industry. And while Sheen\u2019s announcement that he is HIV-positive (and his claims that he spent $10 million trying to keep it quiet) was a huge story this week, a passing reference to the news was out there for two years for anyone to see, be it publications that initially pored over the documents or anyone who dug into the Wikileaks Sony hack page. And yet the story was never revealed. \n \n This bit of information gives some context to what Sheen and Matt Lauer talked about when discussing his future career prospects at the end of his \u201cToday\u201d show interview.

(Evan Agostini/Invision/Associated Press) \n \n Two men from Albuquerque, N.M., may have been plotting to kill singer Justin Bieber and his bodyguard, a New Mexico state police investigation has revealed. \n \n Mark Staake, 41, and his nephew Tanner Ruane, 23, were arrested in late November, New Mexico state police said in a release, after an investigation found they might be plotting to commit murder. \n \n Mark Staake, 41, was arrested by Vermont police on probation violation charges Nov. 19.

(Vermont State Police/Associated Press) \n \n \"Through follow-up investigation it was discovered that Justin Bieber may have also been a target of the murder plot,\" wrote Lt. Robert McDonald in an emailed statement. \n \n The alleged plot was revealed to police by Dana Martin, 45, a convicted killer who says he hired two men for a hit while in state prison. \n \n According to an affidavit for an arrest warrant, Martin wanted all four victims, including Bieber, strangled with a paisley tie, which is similar to how Martin had killed his victims. \n \n The affidavit suggests the first two victims were to be castrated \u2014 with a total of $2,500 US paid to Staake per testicle. However, it does not say the third victim, believed to be Bieber, was to be castrated, as was previously reported. \n \n Martin requested the two men kill four people in two separate attacks, according to the affidavit. According to the document, the ultimate target was a victim referred to as \"J.B,\" whose bodyguard \"M.B.\" would have to be killed first. \n \n Convicted killer felt snubbed by 'J.B.' \n \n Martin told investigators he wanted J.B. killed because he \"has a measure of fame\" and Martin had \"become infatuated\" with him. \n \n Martin has a tattoo of J.B. on his leg and attempted to contact him several times, but became upset when J.B. did not respond, the affidavit says. \n \n The affidavit said this perceived slight and Martin's belief he was a nobody in prison led him to start plotting to kidnap and murder J.B. \n \n Martin told investigators \"he was seeking a measure of notoriety so that there would be people outside of prison who would know who he ... was.\" \n \n The Canadian singer's management, asked to comment on the reports, released a statement saying only that they take \"every precaution to protect and insure the safety of Justin [Bieber] and his fans.\" \n \n Martin, Staake met in prison \n \n Police in Vermont originally arrested Staake on Nov. 19 for violating probation. He is also wanted in New Mexico on two counts of conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree and two counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, Vermont police told CBC News. \n \n Staake and Ruane \"are being investigated for their part in the criminal conspiracy to locate and murder two individuals in Vermont,\" according to the Vermont police statement. \n \n The New Mexico affidavit explains the first two victims Martin ordered to be killed were located in Vermont, but does not provide any identities. \n \n Justin Bieber performs during the halftime show of the 2012 Grey Cup.

(Christinne Muschi/Reuters) \n \n The New Mexico Corrections Department has confirmed it is in the process of extraditing Staake to New Mexico, but Cristina Rodda, the public affairs director, could not confirm whether Staake was the accused in a plot to kill Bieber. \n \n Staake and Martin have both served time at the Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility. \n \n Staake was released on Oct. 22, according to a statement by the state corrections department. He reported and complied with the conditions of his parole until Nov. 14 when he absconded, officials said. \n \n Martin is currently being held in segregation at Southern New Mexico Correctional Facility in Las Cruces, N.M., according to the corrections department. His sentence was just short of 989 years for first-degree murder. \n \n No killings planned in the alleged plot were committed. Instead, Martin revealed the plots to police before Staake and Ruane could act. \n \n Staake was arrested in the Vermont area and Ruane in New York, where Bieber gave a concert on Nov. 28. \n \n With files from The Canadian Press ||||| Police say 41-year-old Mark Staake (LEFT) and his 23-year-old nephew Tanner Ruane (RIGHT) were part of a murder-for-hire plot to mutilate and kill Canadian pop star Justin Bieber. \n \n Accused Anonymous/AP Police say 41-year-old Mark Staake (LEFT) and his 23-year-old nephew Tanner Ruane (RIGHT) were part of a murder-for-hire plot to mutilate and kill Canadian pop star Justin Bieber. \n \n In an email to the Star, Melissa Victor, vice president of media and artist relations at Island Def Jam Music Group, said: \u201cWe take every precaution to protect and insure the safety of Justin and his fans.\u201d \n \n Justin Bieber Sean Kilpatrick/THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo In an email to the Star, Melissa Victor, vice president of media and artist relations at Island Def Jam Music Group, said: \u201cWe take every precaution to protect and insure the safety of Justin and his fans.\u201d \n \n Jeff Green and Shawna Richer \n \n Staff Reporters \n \n \n \n WARNING: THIS STORY CONTAINS GRAPHIC DETAILS \n \n Nothing seemed out of the ordinary when teen pop star Justin Bieber played two sold-out nights at Madison Square Garden in New York on Nov. 28 and 29. \n \n There were thousands of screaming girls, and Bieber seemed especially pumped to be performing at what is widely considered the world\u2019s most prestigious entertainment venue. In the 10 concerts witnessed by a Star writer on Bieber\u2019s Believe tour, a bra flying onto the stage during an encore at the second Garden show was the only thing unusual that night. \n \n But behind the scenes, there was something both sinister and bizarre going on, though it is not known whether Bieber or his people knew of it. \n \n A police affidavit alleges that two prison inmates and a nephew were hatching a plot to murder Bieber and his director of security while the singer was in New York for those shows. \n \n Details of the grisly plan \u2014 which involved strangling two other victims with a paisley tie and then castrating them \u2014 were revealed Wednesday in an affidavit for arrest obtained by New Mexico State Police. \n \n But the plot may have been thwarted by a missed highway exit and a pair of recorded phone calls between an inmate and one of the accused. \n \n According to the affidavit, the plan was hatched behind bars after inmate Dana Martin was transferred from a Florida prison to the Southern New Mexico Corrections Facility in April. \n \n Shawna Richer travelled North America for two months, watched the superstar perform 11 concerts, and met hundreds of fans, in search of what it means to be a Belieber. Available Friday Dec. 21 at stardispatches.com \n \n Martin, 45, serving a life sentence for the rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl in Vermont, was reportedly obsessed with Bieber. He had written him letters and even had a tattoo of the singer on his leg. \n \n He allegedly recruited Mark Aaron Staake, 41, a fellow inmate at the time, after Staake noticed the tattoo on his leg. The plan was to kill four people in two states, with Bieber as the main target. \n \n Oddly, the details were spilled on Nov. 20, when Martin asked to speak to police, telling them Staake (who had been released on probation on Oct. 22) and his nephew, Tanner Ruane, 23, had been planning to commit the first two murders, neither of them Bieber. New Mexico police declined to identify those intended victims. \n \n In his interview with police, Martin described how the first two killings were to be carried out: strangulation with a paisley neck tie, followed by castration with Fiskars \u201cDurasharp\u201d brand garden clippers. The affidavit said there was a bounty of $2,500 on each testicle. \n \n \u201cMartin stated that a paisley tie needed to be used because that was what he (Mr. Martin) had used previously,\u201d the affidavit reads. \n \n Martin is serving consecutive life sentences for murders committed in 2000. The strangulation murder of the 15-year-old girl was a \u201ccase of jealousy,\u201d police told The Associated Press. \n \n In his police interview, Martin said that in addition to the two Vermont slayings, there would be two more targets. The main one was identified in the affidavit as J.B., who \u201chas a measure of fame.\u201d \n \n Lt. Robert McDonald of the New Mexico State Police told the Star that \u201cJ.B.\u201d was Bieber. However, investigators from New Mexico State Police have yet to make an official statement. \n \n The affidavit describes Martin as \u201ca very good manipulator,\u201d who, \u201cas part of his ruse,\u201d convinced Staake he had access to large sums of money and a multimillion-dollar historic home where Staake and Ruane could hide out. \n \n He also allegedly told Staake he had connections to Chinese gangs in New York, who had \u201csanctioned\u201d the murders. \n \n Martin told police he had been in contact with Staake since his release, and that Staake was to be in New York City in late November. \n \n McDonald declined to speculate on why Martin revealed the plot to police when he did, but a pair of phone conversations on Nov. 19 hint at a plot unravelling. \n \n The plan, according to the affidavit, called for two murders in Vermont, followed by two in New York. But the would-be assassins missed an exit in Vermont and were headed toward Canada on Nov. 19 in a 1983 BMW. When they spoke with a U.S. border agent at the Highgate Springs crossing, Staake was arrested on an outstanding New Mexico warrant. \n \n That same day, Ruane phoned Martin in a call, recorded by the prison, telling him of Staake\u2019s arrest. \u201cMr. Ruane did not want to \u2018move it forward\u2019 without Mr. Staake,\u201d reads the affidavit, referring to the two Vermont killings. \n \n Ruane then made his way south, phoning Martin again from a truck stop in Rotterdam, N.Y. The focus of that call was on Victims 3 (Bieber) and 4. \n \n In the recorded conversation, Ruane tells Martin that Staake was going to \u201chandle the whole putting down of the \u2018dogs\u2019 and I (Mr. Ruane) was going to go \u2018snip, snip.\u2019\u201d \n \n Martin went to police the next day and Ruane was arrested Nov. 26 by New York State Police, who had been on the lookout for the BMW. \n \n New Mexico State Police are working to get Staake and Ruane back to that state. \u201cPaperwork is in the process to get them extradited,\u201d said McDonald. \n \n The question now is could the alleged hit men have got close enough to Bieber to carry out the abduction and gruesome attack? \n \n The pop star employs an imposing security detail. Chief among them are security director Moshe Benabou, a former Israeli soldier, and Dustin Folkes, a celebrity bodyguard based in Los Angeles. They are never far from him. Nor is tour manager Kenny Hamilton, who formerly served as Bieber\u2019s bodyguard. \n \n \u201cWe take every precaution to protect and ensure the safety of Justin and his fans,\u201d Melissa Victor, vice-president of media and artist relations for Island Def Jam Music Group, told the Star in an email. \n \n These bodyguards are obsessively protective of Bieber when it comes to paparazzi and sometimes even well-meaning fans. \n \n Given the number of teenage girls who follow Bieber and stake out his hotels, his security detail is vigilant. He was the target last year of an allegation that he fathered a child with an obsessed fan after a brief encounter in a backstage bathroom. Bieber supplied DNA to prove he was not the father. \n \n Related: Justin Bieber at The Rogers Centre \n \n Grammy Awards: Justin Bieber shunned, Drake and Carly Rae Jepsen nominated \n \n Justin Bieber tops Bing searches in Canada \n \n Drop-crotch pants: Is this now a thing?",

Last month, Bauer and Fattal were sentenced to eight years in prison. \n \n Shourd was released in September 2010 on medical and humanitarian grounds after posting $500,000 bail. \n \n In Washington, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said she was \u201cencouraged\u201d by Ahmadinejad\u2019s comments. There was no immediate reaction from the families of Bauer or Fattal. \n \n The promise to free the hikers could eliminate a key flash point in relations between Iran and the United States, although many more remain. It comes just weeks before Ahmadinejad is due to visit New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting, and it coincides with other conciliatory actions by Iran, including a letter to European Union officials offering new talks on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. \n \n It was not clear, however, whether Iran\u2019s diplomatic outreach included the kinds of concessions that Western officials say would be necessary to resume talks that broke down in January. \n \n In the interview Tuesday, Ahmadinejad suggested he was open to a resolution of the standoff over the country\u2019s uranium-enrichment program, although apparent deals have fallen apart in the past. \n \n $500,000 bail demanded \n \n Masoud Shafiei, a lawyer representing the hikers, said he had been told by court officials that each of them would have to pay $500,000 in bail, as Shourd had to do. He said the bond was being demanded because, even though Bauer and Fattal have been convicted, their case is open to appeal and a final verdict has not been rendered. \n \n \u201cBasically if they don\u2019t pay their bail, they won\u2019t be freed,\u201d Shafiei said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who arranged this, the court or the president. The judiciary has said that everything is being done according to their procedures.\u201d \n \n Ahmadinejad said Bauer and Fattal will be \u201cfree to choose\u201d how they return to the United States. Ahmadinejad\u2019s decision to pardon the men is subject to review by Iran\u2019s clerical authorities. \n \n Bauer, Fattal and Shourd were hiking in the mountains of Iraq\u2019s northern Kurdish region on July 31, 2009, when, according to their families, they strayed across the border by accident. Authorities in Tehran confirmed three days later that the three had been arrested, and an Iranian Arabic-language television network quoted police sources as saying the hikers were \u201cCIA agents.\u201d \n \n Bauer and Shourd were free-lance journalists who were living together in Damascus, Syria, where Shourd also taught English and was studying Arabic, friends and relatives said. Fattal is a friend of Bauer\u2019s who was visiting the Middle East to explore his father\u2019s roots in Iraq. All three graduated from the University of California at Berkeley. \n \n Bauer, an Arabic speaker from Minnesota who graduated from Berkeley in 2007 with a degree in Arabic and peace and conflict studies, was a Middle East correspondent for New America Media and has written for publications including the Nation magazine, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Los Angeles Times and Slate.com. Shourd has written for Brave New Traveler, an online travel magazine. At the time of her arrest, she had identified herself on the magazine\u2019s Web site as a \u201cteacher-activist-writer from California currently based in the Middle East.\u201d \n \n In May 2010, the three Americans\u2019 mothers were allowed to meet with their children in Tehran for the first time since their arrest. The hikers had complained to diplomats about isolation and depression while being held in Evin prison. \n \n But Iran\u2019s intelligence minister, Heidar Moslehi, reiterated his accusations during the visit that the three hikers were on an espionage mission. And he repeated demands for the release of Iranians allegedly abducted by the United States. \n \n Call for elections in Syria \n \n Ahmadinejad parried questions Tuesday about Iran\u2019s ties with the embattled government in Syria, a key ally. \n \n Ahmadinejad called for free elections in Syria and suggested that President Bashar al-Assad implement a reform program, although he was vague about the type of reforms he recommended. \n \n He said Iran\u2019s economy was flourishing, in contrast to the economies of the United States and Western powers that have led efforts to penalize Iran for its uranium-enrichment program. \u201cThose who imposed sanctions on us are now facing economic recession,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have created problems for themselves because we have a large economy.\u201d \n \n Ahmadinejad brushed off reports of a serious rift between him and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme religious and political authority in the Islamic republic. \u201cCan you find two people in the world who are the same?\u201d he said in response to a question about the split, which surfaced this year when Ahmadinejad attempted to dismiss his intelligence minister, only to be overruled by Khamenei. \n \n The president also shrugged off attacks on a key aide and confidant, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who has been heavily criticized by hard-line conservatives and clerics loyal to Khamenei. \n \n \u201cI do not expect all to like my colleagues,\u201d Ahmadinejad said. \n \n Correspondent Thomas Erdbrink in Tehran and staff writers William Branigin and Joby Warrick in Washington contributed to this report.",

So are \"kick the can down the road,\" `'trending\" and \"bucket list.\" \n \n A dirty dozen have landed on the 38th annual List of Words to be Banished from the Queen's English for Misuse, Overuse and General Uselessness. The nonbinding, tongue-in-cheek decree released Monday by northern Michigan's Lake Superior State University is based on nominations submitted from the United States, Canada and beyond. \n \n \"Spoiler alert,\" the seemingly thoughtful way to warn readers or viewers about looming references to a key plot point in a film or TV show, nevertheless passed its use-by date for many, including Joseph Foly, of Fremont, California. He argued in his submission the phrase is \"used as an obnoxious way to show one has trivial information and is about to use it, no matter what.\" \n \n At the risk of further offense, here's another spoiler alert: The phrase receiving the most nominations this year is \"fiscal cliff,\" banished because of its overuse by media outlets when describing across-the-board federal tax increases and spending cuts that economists say could harm the economy in the new year without congressional action. \n \n \"You can't turn on the news without hearing this,\" said Christopher Loiselle, of Midland, Michigan, in his submission. \"I'm equally worried about the River of Debt and Mountain of Despair.\" \n \n Other terms coming in for a literary lashing are \"superfood,\" `'guru,\" `'job creators\" and \"double down.\" \n \n University spokesman Tom Pink said that in nearly four decades, the Sault Ste. Marie school has \"banished\" around 900 words or phrases, and somehow the whole idea has survived rapidly advancing technology and diminishing attention spans. \n \n Nominations used to come by mail, then fax and website, he said, and now most come through the university's Facebook page. That's fitting, since social media has helped accelerate the life cycle of certain words and phrases, such as this year's entry \"YOLO\" _ \"you only live once.\" \n \n \"The list surprises me in one way or another every year, and the same way every year: I'm always surprised how people still like it, love it,\" he said. \n \n Rounding out the list are \"job creators/creation,\" `'boneless wings\" and \"passion/passionate.\" Those who nominated the last one say they are tired of hearing about a company's \"passion\" as a substitute for providing a service or product for money. \n \n Andrew Foyle, of Bristol, England, said it's gotten to the point where \"passion\" is the only ingredient that keeps a chef from preparing \"seared tuna\" that tastes \"like dust swept from a station platform.\" \n \n \"Apparently, it's insufficient to do it ably, with skill, commitment or finesse,\" Foyle said. \"Passionate, begone!\" \n \n As usual, the etymological exercise _ or exorcise _ only goes so far. Past lists haven't eradicated \"viral,\" \"amazing,\" `'LOL\" or \"man cave\" from everyday use. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Jeff Karoub on Twitter: http://twitter.com/jeffkaroub",

His grandmother cared for him and when she worked selling toys and flower garlands on the roadside, she tethered the child to a local bus stop, according to Getty. At night Kale's grandmother tied his leg to hers, so she would know if he ran off. \n \n Pictures of the boy lying listlessly on the ground were printed in the local newspapers this week and drew outrage from readers. After the photos were published, local authorities intervened, according to the Times of India. \n \n The boy has since been taken to a children's shelter. ||||| MUMBAI: Clad in a shirt and shorts, Lakhan Kale eats biscuits off his grandmother's shrivelled hands, lies on a bench and stares sleepily at the brown, sloping roof.

His father died four years ago; a few months later his mother went missing. As a routine, Kale's grandmother, Sakkubai Kale (66) and his sister, Rekha (12), used to tie him to a pole at the bus stop near Mantralaya before going to work for fear of him wandering off or being run over. \"I tried to admit him in a few shelters but they refused to entertain me,\" Sakkubai said. \n \n \n \n Two days ago, a daily printed a picture of Lakhan with his leg tethered, after which a team from Marine Drive police station brought in Lakhan's family for questioning and, later, took them to meet social worker Meena Mutha. On Wednesday, with the help of Mutha, police sub-inspector SG Phanse and sub-inspector Santosh Tore were able to admit Lakhan to The Children's Aid Society, a shelter for destitute, orphaned and victimised kids in Dongri. \n \n \n \n An NOC from Sakkubai, Lakhan's medical reports and a letter from Mutha's Manav Foundation, which works towards rehabilitating those mentally-ill, helped secure the admission. \"At least, we can now rest assured that he is in good hands,\" says Mutha, who had been trying to find a shelter for Lakhan since Tuesday. \"The shelter will also take care of Lakhan's treatments,\" said Mutha as her car pulled out of the shelter.

    "document": "Cover story \n \n Reports of abuse \n \n AIDS exacerbates sexual exploitation of nuns, reports allege By JOHN L. ALLEN JR. and PAMELA SCHAEFFER \n \n NCR Staff, Rome and Kansas City, Mo. S everal reports written by senior members of women\u0092s religious orders and by an American priest assert that sexual abuse of nuns by priests, including rape, is a serious problem, especially in Africa and other parts of the developing world. The reports allege that some Catholic clergy exploit their financial and spiritual authority to gain sexual favors from religious women, many of whom, in developing countries, are culturally conditioned to be subservient to men. The reports obtained by NCR -- some recent, some in circulation at least seven years -- say priests at times demand sex in exchange for favors, such as permission or certification to work in a given diocese. The reports, five in all, indicate that in Africa particularly, a continent ravaged by HIV and AIDS, young nuns are sometimes seen as safe targets of sexual activity. In a few extreme instances, according to the documentation, priests have impregnated nuns and then encouraged them to have abortions. In some cases, according to one of the reports, nuns, through naivet\u00e9 or social conditioning to obey authority figures, may readily comply with sexual demands. Although the problem has not been aired in public, the reports have been discussed in councils of religious women and men and in the Vatican. In November 1998, a four-page paper titled \u0093The Problem of the Sexual Abuse of African Religious in Africa and Rome\u0094 was presented by Missionaries of Our Lady of Africa Sr. Marie McDonald, the report\u0092s author, to the Council of 16, a group that meets three times a year. The council is made up of delegates from three bodies: the Union of Superiors General, an association of men\u0092s religious communities based in Rome, the International Union of Superiors General, a comparable group for women, and the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, the Vatican office that oversees religious life. Last September, Benedictine Sr. Esther Fangman, a psychological counselor and president of the Federation of St. Scholastica, raised the issue in an address at a Rome congress of 250 Benedictine abbots. The federation is an organization of 22 monasteries in the United States and two in Mexico. Five years earlier, on Feb. 18, 1995, Cardinal Eduardo Mart\u00ednez, prefect of the Vatican congregation for religious life, along with members of his staff, were briefed on the problem by Medical Missionary of Mary Sr. Maura O\u0092Donohue, a physician. O\u0092Donohue is responsible for a 1994 report that constitutes one of the more comprehensive accounts. At the time of its writing, she had spent six years as AIDS coordinator for the Catholic Fund for Overseas Development based in London. Though statistics related to sexual abuse of religious women are unavailable, most religious leaders interviewed by NCR say the frequency and consistency of the reports of sexual abuse point to a problem that needs to be addressed. \u0093I don\u0092t believe these are simply exceptional cases,\u0094 Benedictine Fr. Nokter Wolf, abbot primate of the Benedictine order, told NCR. \u0093I think the abuse described is happening. How much it happens, what the numbers are, I have no way of knowing. But it is a serious matter, and we need to discuss it.\u0094 Wolf has made several trips to Africa to visit Benedictine institutions and is in contact with members of the order there. In her reports, O\u0092Donohue links the sexual abuse to the prevalence of AIDS in Africa and concerns about contracting the disease. \u0093Sadly, the sisters also report that priests have sexually exploited them because they too had come to fear contamination with HIV by sexual contact with prostitutes and other \u0091at risk\u0092 women,\u0094 she wrote in 1994. O\u0092Donohue declined requests for interviews with NCR. In some cultures, O\u0092Donohue wrote, men who traditionally would have sought out prostitutes instead are turning to \u0093secondary school girls, who, because of their younger age, were considered \u0091safe\u0092 from HIV.\u0094 Similarly, religious sisters \u0093constitute another group which has been identified as \u0091safe\u0092 targets for sexual activity,\u0094 O\u0092Donohue wrote. \u0093For example,\u0094 O\u0092Donohue wrote, \u0093a superior of a community of sisters in one country was approached by priests requesting that sisters would be made available to them for sexual favors. When the superior refused, the priests explained that they would otherwise be obliged to go to the village to find women, and might thus get AIDS.\u0094 O\u0092Donohue wrote that at first she reacted with \u0093shock and disbelief\u0094 at the \u0093magnitude\u0094 of the problem she was encountering through her contacts with \u0093a great number of sisters during the course of my visits\u0094 in a number of countries. Different view of celibacy \u0093The AIDS pandemic has drawn attention to issues which may not previously have been considered significant,\u0094 she wrote. \u0093The enormous challenges which AIDS poses for members of religious orders and the clergy is only now becoming evident.\u0094 In a report on her 1995 meeting with Cardinal Mart\u00ednez in the Vatican, O\u0092Donohue noted that celibacy may have different meanings in different cultures. For instance, she wrote in her report, a vicar general in one African diocese had talked \u0093quite openly\u0094 about the view of celibacy in Africa, saying that \u0093celibacy in the African context means a priest does not get married but does not mean he does not have children.\u0094 Of the world\u0092s 1 billion Catholics, 116.6 million -- about 12 percent -- live in Africa. According to the 2001 Catholic Almanac, 561 are bishops and archbishops, 26,026 are priests and 51,304 are nuns. In addition to such general overviews, Mart\u00ednez\u0092s office has also received documentation on specific cases. In one such incident, dating from 1988 in Malawi and cited in O\u0092Donohue\u0092s 1994 report, the leadership team of a diocesan women\u0092s congregation was dismissed by the local bishop after it complained that 29 sisters had been impregnated by diocesan priests. Western missionaries helped the leadership team compile a dossier that was eventually submitted to Rome. One of those missionaries, a veteran of more than two decades in Africa, said the Malawi case was complex and the issue of sexual liaisons was not the only factor involved. She described the incident in a not-for-attribution interview with NCR. The missionary said the leadership team had adopted rules preventing sisters from spending the night in a rectory, banning priests from staying overnight in convents and prohibiting sisters from being alone with priests. The rules were intended to reduce the possibility of sexual contact. Several sources told NCR that religious communities as well as church officials have taken steps to correct the problem, though they were reluctant to cite specific examples. Others say the climate of secrecy that still surrounds the issue indicates more needs to be done. The secrecy is due in part to efforts by religious orders to work within the system to address the problems and in part to the cultural context in which they occur. In sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, where the problems are reportedly the most severe, sexual behavior and AIDS are rarely discussed openly. Among many people in that region of Central and Southern Africa, sexual topics are virtually taboo, according to many who have worked there. Expressing frustration at unsuccessful efforts to get church officials to address the problem, O\u0092Donohue wrote in 1994, \u0093Groups of sisters from local congregations have made passionate appeals for help to members of international congregations and explain that, when they themselves try to make representations to church authorities about harassment by priests, they simply \u0091are not heard.\u0092 \u0094 The Vatican press office did not respond to NCR requests for comment on this story. O\u0092Donohue wrote that, although she was aware of incidents in some 23 countries, including the United States, on five continents, the majority happened in Africa. Ironically, given the reticence of many Africans to talk about sex, casual sex is common in parts of Africa, and sexual abstinence is rare. It\u0092s a culture in which AIDS thrives. Experts say the view derives from a deeply rooted cultural association between maleness and progeny -- a view that makes the church\u0092s insistence on celibacy difficult not only in practice but also in concept for some African priests. AIDS rampant in Africa Some 25.3 million of the world\u0092s 36.1 million HIV-positive persons live in sub-Saharan Africa. Since the epidemic began in the late 1970s, 17 million Africans have died of AIDS, according to the World Health Organization. Of the 5.3 million new cases of HIV infection in 2000, 3.8 million occurred in Africa. According to a graphic article on AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa in the Feb. 12 issue of Time magazine, \u0093Casual sex of every kind is commonplace. Everywhere there\u0092s premarital sex, sex as recreation. Obligatory sex and its abusive counterpart, coercive sex. Transactional sex: sex as a gift, sugar-daddy sex. Extramarital sex, second families, multiple partners.\u0094 Further, Time reported, women, taught from birth to obey men, feel powerless to protect themselves from men\u0092s sexual desires. Even accounting for promiscuity -- which in fact, some experts have argued, is no less a problem in Western nations -- the religious men and women raising the issue of sexual exploitation of religious women say the situations they report on are clearly intolerable and, in some cases, approach the unspeakable. In one instance, according to O\u0092Donohue, a priest took a nun for an abortion, and she died during the procedure. He later officiated at her requiem Mass. Harassment common In McDonald\u0092s report, she states that \u0093sexual harassment and even rape of sisters by priests and bishops is allegedly common,\u0094 and that \u0093sometimes when a sister becomes pregnant, the priest insists that she have an abortion.\u0094 She said her report referred mainly to Africa and to African sisters, priests and bishops -- not because the problem is exclusively an African one, but because the group preparing the report drew \u0093mainly on their own experience in Africa and the knowledge they have obtained from the members of their own congregations or from other congregations -- especially diocesan congregations in Africa.\u0094 \u0093We know that the problem exists elsewhere too,\u0094 she wrote. \u0093It is precisely because of our love for the church and for Africa that we feel so distressed about the problem,\u0094 McDonald wrote. McDonald\u0092s was the report presented in 1998 to the Council of 16. She declined to be interviewed by NCR. When a sister becomes pregnant, McDonald wrote, she is usually punished by dismissal from the congregation, while the priest is \u0093often only moved to another parish -- or sent for studies.\u0094 In her report, McDonald wrote that priests sometimes exploit the financial dependency of young sisters or take advantage of spiritual direction and the sacrament of reconciliation to extort sexual favors. McDonald cites eight factors she believes give rise to the problem: The fact that celibacy and/or chastity are not values in some countries. \n \n The inferior position of women in society and the church. In some circumstances \u0093a sister has been educated to regard herself as an inferior, to be subservient and to obey.\u0094 \u0093It is understandable then, that a sister finds it impossible to refuse a cleric who asks for sexual favours. These men are seen as \u0091authority figures\u0092 who must be obeyed.\u0094 \u0093Moreover, they are usually more highly educated and they have received a much more advanced theological formation than the sisters. They may use false theological arguments to justify their requests and behaviour. The sisters are easily impressed by these arguments. One of these goes as follows: \u0093 \u0091We are both consecrated celibates. That means that we have promised not to marry. However, we can have sex together without breaking our vows.\u0092 \u0094 The AIDS pandemic, which means sisters are more likely to be seen as \u0093safe.\u0094 \n \n Financial dependence created by low stipends for sisters laboring in their home countries or inadequate support for sisters sent abroad for studies. The problem of sexual abuse in Africa is most common, according to many observers, among members of diocesan religious congregations with little money and no network of international support. \n \n A poor understanding of consecrated life, both by the sisters and also by bishops, priests, and lay people. \n \n Recruitment of candidates by congregations that lack adequate knowledge of the culture. \n \n Sisters sent abroad to Rome and other countries for studies are often \u0093too young and/or immature,\u0094 lack language skills, preparation and other kinds of support, and \u0093frequently turn to seminarians and priests for help,\u0094 creating the potential for exploitation. \u0093I do not wish to imply that only priests and bishops are to blame and that the sisters are simply their victims,\u0094 McDonald wrote. \u0093No, sisters can sometimes be only too willing and can also be na\u00efve.\u0094 Silence. \u0093Perhaps another contributing factor is the \u0091conspiracy of silence\u0092 surrounding this issue,\u0094 McDonald wrote. \u0093Only if we can look at it honestly will we be able to find solutions.\u0094 The American priest who gave a similar account of sexual abuse of women religious is Fr. Robert J. Vitillo, then of Caritas and now executive director of the U.S. bishops\u0092 Campaign for Human Development. In March 1994, a month after O\u0092Donohue wrote her report, Vitillo spoke about the problem to a theological study group at Boston College. Vitillo has extensive knowledge of Africa based on regular visits for his work. His talk, which focused on several moral and ethical issues related to AIDS, was titled, \u0093Theological Challenges Posed by the Global Pandemic of HIV/AIDS.\u0094 \u0091Necessary to mention\u0092 Vitillo, a priest of the Paterson, N.J., diocese, declined requests from NCR for an interview on the content of his talk. He told the gathering at Boston College that nuns had been targeted by men, particularly clergy, who may have previously frequented prostitutes. \u0093The last ethical issue which I find especially delicate but necessary to mention,\u0094 he said, \u0093involves the need to denounce sexual abuse which has arisen as a specific result of HIV/AIDS. In many parts of the world, men have decreased their reliance on commercial sex workers because of their fear of contracting HIV. As a result of this widespread fear, many men (and some women) have turned to young (and therefore presumably uninfected) girls (and boys) for sexual favors. Religious women have also been targeted by such men, and especially by clergy who may have previously frequented prostitutes. I myself have heard the tragic stories of religious women who were forced to have sex with the local priest or with a spiritual counselor who insisted that this activity was \u0091good\u0092 for the both of them. \u0093Frequently, attempts to raise these issues with local and international church authorities have met with deaf ears,\u0094 said Vitillo. \u0093In North America and in some parts of Europe, our church is already reeling under the pedophilia scandals. How long will it take for this same institutional church to become sensitive to these new abuse issues which are resulting from the pandemic?\u0094 The specific circumstances outlined in the O\u0092Donohue report are as follows: In some instances, candidates to religious life had to provide sexual favors to priests in order to acquire the necessary certificates and/or recommendations to work in a diocese. \n \n In several countries, sisters are troubled by policies that require them to leave the congregation if they become pregnant, while the priest involved is able to continue his ministry. Beyond fairness is the question of social justice, since the sister is left to raise the child as a single parent, \u0093often with a great deal of stigmatization and frequently in very poor socioeconomic circumstances. I was given examples in several countries where such women were forced into becoming a second or third wife in a family because of lost status in the local culture. The alternative, as a matter of survival, is to go \u0091on the streets\u0092 as prostitutes\u0094 and thereby \u0093expose themselves to the risk of HIV, if not already infected.\u0094 \n \n \u0093Superior generals I have met were extremely concerned about the harassment sisters were experiencing from priests in some areas. One superior of a diocesan congregation, where several sisters became pregnant by priests, has been at a complete loss to find an appropriate solution. Another diocesan congregation has had to dismiss over 20 sisters because of pregnancy, again in many cases by priests. \n \n \u0093Some priests are recommending that sisters take a contraceptive, misleading them that \u0091the pill\u0092 will prevent transmission of HIV. Others have actually encouraged abortion for sisters with whom they have been involved. Some Catholic medical professionals employed in Catholic hospitals have reported pressure being exerted on them by priests to procure abortions in those hospitals for religious sisters. \n \n \u0093In a number of countries, members of parish councils and of small Christian communities are challenging their pastors because of their relationships with women and young girls generally. Some of these women are wives of the parishioners. In such circumstances, husbands are angry about what is happening, but are embarrassed to challenge their parish priest. Some priests are known to have relations with several women, and also to have children from more than one liaison. Laypeople spoke with me about the concerns in this context stating that they are waiting for the day when they will have dialogue homilies. This, they volunteered, will afford them an opportunity to challenge certain priests on the sincerity of their preaching and their apparent double standards. In one country visited, I was informed that the presbytery in a particular parish was attacked by parishioners armed with guns because they were angry with the priests because of their abuse of power and the betrayal of trust which their actions and lifestyles reflected. \n \n \u0093In another country a recent convert from Islam (one of two daughters who became Christians) was accepted as a candidate to a local religious congregation. When she went to her parish priest for the required certificates, she was subjected to rape by the priest before being given the certificates. Having been disowned by her family because of becoming a Christian, she did not feel free to return home. She joined the congregation and soon afterwards found she was pregnant. To her mind, the only option for her was to leave the congregation, without giving the reason. She spent 10 days roaming the forest, agonizing over what to do. Then she decided to go and talk to the bishop, who called in the priest. The priest accepted the accusation as true and was told by the bishop to go on a two-week retreat. \n \n \u0093Since the 1980s in a number of countries sisters are refusing to travel alone with a priest in a car because of fear of harassment or even rape. Priests have also on occasion abused their position in their role as pastors and spiritual directors and utilized their spiritual authority to gain sexual favors from sisters. In one country, women superiors have had to request the bishop or men superiors to remove chaplains, spiritual directors or retreat directors after they abused sisters.\u0094 Those most directly affected are the women abused, wrote O\u0092Donohue. The effects extend, however, to the wider community and include disillusionment and cynicism. The abused and others in the community \u0093find the foundation of their faith is suddenly shattered.\u0094 Many whose faith has been shattered are from families that look unfavorably on religious vocations and who \u0093question why celibacy should be so strongly proclaimed by the same people who are seemingly involved in sexually exploiting others. This is seen as hypocrisy or at least as promoting double standards,\u0094 O\u0092Donohue wrote. Some observers say that in the wake of such reports, steps have been taken to address the problem. New guidelines Wolf, the Benedictine leader in Rome, said, \u0093Several monasteries already have guidelines in case a monk is accused of sexual misconduct, taking care of the individuals concerned, the victim included. I pushed this question in our congregation. We need sincerity and justice.\u0094 A Vatican official told NCR that \u0093there are initiatives at multiple levels\u0094 to raise awareness about the potential for sexual abuse in religious life. The official cited efforts within conferences of religious superiors, within bishops\u0092 conferences, and within particular communities and dioceses. Most of these, the official said, were steps the Vatican is \u0093aware of\u0094 and \u0093supporting\u0094 rather than organizing or initiating. The Vatican official was willing to speak anonymously about the problem with NCR. The official noted two signs that the culture in the church is changing. In specific cases, the official said, the response from church leaders is more aggressive and swift; and in general, there is a climate within religious life that these things have to be discussed. \u0093Talking about it is the first step towards a solution,\u0094 the official said. Church officials have not always, however, been open to such exchanges. McDonald wrote in her 1998 report that in March of that year she had spoken to the standing committee of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar, the consortium of African bishops\u0092 conferences, on the problem of sexual abuse of sisters. \u0093Since most of what I gave was based on reports coming from diocesan congregations and Conferences of Major Superiors in Africa, I felt very convinced of the authenticity of what I was saying,\u0094 McDonald wrote. Yet, \u0093the bishops present felt that it was disloyal of the sisters to have sent such reports outside their dioceses,\u0094 McDonald wrote. \u0093They said that the sisters in question should go to their diocesan bishop with these problems.\u0094 \u0093Of course,\u0094 she wrote, \u0093this would be the ideal. However, the sisters claim that they have done so time and time again. Sometimes they are not well received. In some instances they are blamed for what has happened. Even when they are listened to sympathetically, nothing much seems to be done.\u0094 Worth talking about Whatever positive steps have been taken, the problem remains a live concern for religious women. In an interview at her home in Kansas City, Mo., Fangman, the nun who raised the issue last September at a gathering of Benedictine abbots in Rome, told NCR that she had heard the stories about sisters being sexually abused by priests during informal discussions at meetings of abbesses and prioresses worldwide. \u0093The sisters who brought it up were deeply hurt by it and found it very painful -- and very painful to talk about,\u0094 she said. Because of the pain that she and others were hearing, \u0093we decided that it was worth also beginning to talk about in a more open way, and we had the opportunity at our regular meeting with the Congress of Abbots,\u0094 she said. Fangman said her report to the Benedictine abbots was based on the conversations with sisters and on the material in O\u0092Donohue\u0092s reports. Fangman\u0092s talk was published in a recent issue of the Alliance for International Monasticism Bulletin, a mission magazine of the order. O\u0092Donohue\u0092s report was prepared in a similar spirit: in hope of promoting change. She wrote in her report that she had prepared it \u0093after much profound reflection and with a deep sense of urgency since the subjects involved touch the very core of the church\u0092s mission and ministry.\u0094 The information on abuse of nuns by priests \u0093comes from missionaries (men and women); from priests, doctors and other members of our loyal ecclesial family,\u0094 she wrote. \u0093I have been assured that case records exist for several of the incidents\u0094 described in the report, she said, \u0093and that the information is not just based on hearsay.\u0094 The 23 countries listed in her report are: Botswana, Burundi, Brazil, Colombia, Ghana, India, Ireland, Italy, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Tonga, Uganda, United States, Zambia, Zaire, Zimbabwe. Her hope, she wrote, is that the report \u0093will consequently motivate appropriate action especially on the part of those in positions of church leadership and those responsible for formation.\u0094 John Allen\u0092s e-mail address is jallen@natcath.org.

(Associated Press) \n \n FILE - In this Sunday, Dec. 20, 2009 file photo, a nun is silhouetted in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. Some nuns are now finding their voices, buoyed by the #MeToo movement and the growing recognition that adults can be victims of sexual abuse when there is an imbalance of power in a relationship.... (Associated Press) \n \n VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 The nun no longer goes to confession regularly, after an Italian priest forced himself on her while she was at her most vulnerable: recounting her sins to him in a university classroom nearly 20 years ago. \n \n At the time, the sister only told her provincial superior and her spiritual director, silenced by the Catholic Church's culture of secrecy, her vows of obedience and her own fear, repulsion and shame. \n \n \"It opened a great wound inside of me,\" she told the Associated Press. \"I pretended it didn't happen.\" \n \n After decades of silence, the nun is one of a handful worldwide to come forward recently on an issue that the Catholic Church has yet to come to terms with: The sexual abuse of religious sisters by priests and bishops. An AP examination has found that cases have emerged in Europe, Africa, South America and Asia, demonstrating that the problem is global and pervasive, thanks to the universal tradition of sisters' second-class status in the Catholic Church and their ingrained subservience to the men who run it. \n \n Some nuns are now finding their voices, buoyed by the #MeToo movement and the growing recognition that adults can be victims of sexual abuse when there is an imbalance of power in a relationship. The sisters are going public in part because of years of inaction by church leaders, even after major studies on the problem in Africa were reported to the Vatican in the 1990s. \n \n The issue has flared in the wake of scandals over the sexual abuse of children, and recently of adults, including revelations that one of the most prominent American cardinals, Theodore McCarrick, sexually abused and harassed his seminarians. \n \n The extent of the abuse of nuns is unclear, at least outside the Vatican. Victims are reluctant to report the abuse because of well-founded fears they won't be believed, experts told the AP. Church leaders are reluctant to acknowledge that some priests and bishops simply ignore their vows of celibacy, knowing that their secrets will be kept. \n \n However, this week, about half a dozen sisters in a small religious congregation in Chile went public on national television with their stories of abuse by priests and other nuns \u2014 and how their superiors did nothing to stop it. A nun in India recently filed a formal police complaint accusing a bishop of rape, something that would have been unthinkable even a year ago. \n \n Cases in Africa have come up periodically; in 2013, for example, a well-known priest in Uganda wrote a letter to his superiors that mentioned \"priests romantically involved with religious sisters\" \u2014 for which he was promptly suspended from the church until he apologized in May. And the sister in Europe spoke to the AP to help bring the issue to light. \n \n \"I am so sad that it took so long for this to come into the open, because there were reports long ago,\" Karlijn Demasure, one of the church's leading experts on clergy sexual abuse and abuse of power, told the AP in an interview. \"I hope that now actions will be taken to take care of the victims and put an end to this kind of abuse.\" \n \n ___ \n \n TAKING VICTIMS SERIOUSLY \n \n The Vatican declined to comment on what measures, if any, it has taken to assess the scope of the problem globally, what it has done to punish offenders and care for the victims. A Vatican official said it is up to local church leaders to sanction priests who sexually abuse sisters, but that often such crimes go unpunished both in civil and canonical courts. \n \n The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to speak to the issue, said only some cases arrive at the Holy See for investigation. It was a reference to the fact that the Catholic Church has no clear measures in place to investigate and punish bishops who themselves abuse or allow abusers to remain in their ranks \u2014 a legal loophole that has recently been highlighted by the McCarrick case. \n \n The official said the church has focused much of its attention recently on protecting children, but that vulnerable adults \"deserve the same protection.\" \n \n \"Consecrated women have to be encouraged to speak up when they are molested,\" the official told the AP. \"Bishops have to be encouraged to take them seriously, and make sure the priests are punished if guilty.\" \n \n But being taken seriously is often the toughest obstacle for sisters who are sexually abused, said Demasure, until recently executive director of the church's Center for Child Protection at the Pontifical Gregorian University, the church's leading think tank on the issue. \n \n \"They (the priests) can always say 'she wanted it,'\" Demasure said. \"It is also difficult to get rid of the opinion that it is always the woman who seduces the man, and not vice versa.\" \n \n Demasure said many priests in Africa, for example, struggle with celibacy because of traditional and cultural beliefs in the importance of having children. Novices, who are just entering religious life, are particularly vulnerable because they often need a letter from their parish priest to be accepted into certain religious congregations. \"And sometimes they have to pay for that,\" she said. \n \n And when these women become pregnant? \n \n \"Mainly she has an abortion. Even more than once. And he pays for that. A religious sister has no money. A priest, yes,\" she said. \n \n There can also be a price for blowing the whistle on the problem. \n \n In 2013, the Rev. Anthony Musaala in Kampala, Uganda wrote what he called an open letter to members of the local Catholic establishment about \"numerous cases\" of alleged sex liaisons of priests, including with nuns. He charged that it was \"an open secret that many Catholic priests and some bishops, in Uganda and elsewhere, no longer live celibate chastity.\" \n \n He was sanctioned, even though Ugandan newspapers regularly report cases of priests caught in sex escapades. The topic is even the subject of a popular novel taught in high schools. \n \n In 2012, a priest sued a bishop in western Uganda who had suspended him and ordered him to stop interacting with at least four nuns. The priest, who denied the allegations, lost the suit, and the sisters later withdrew their own suit against the bishop. \n \n Archbishop John Baptist Odama, leader of the local Ugandan conference of bishops, told the AP that unverified or verified allegations against individual priests should not be used to smear the whole church. \n \n \"Individual cases may happen, if they are there,\" he said Thursday. \"Individual cases must be treated as individual cases.\" \n \n ___ \n \n PRIESTLY ABUSE OF NUNS IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM \n \n Long before the most recent incidents, confidential reports into the problem focused on Africa and AIDS were prepared in the 1990s by members of religious orders for top church officials. In 1994, the late Sr. Maura O'Donohue wrote the most comprehensive study about a six-year, 23-nation survey, in which she learned of 29 nuns who had been impregnated in a single congregation. \n \n Nuns, she reported, were considered \"safe\" sexual partners for priests who feared they might be infected with HIV if they went to prostitutes or women in the general population. \n \n Four years later, in a report to top religious superiors and Vatican officials, Sr. Marie McDonald said harassment and rape of African sisters by priests is \"allegedly common.\" Sometimes, when a nun becomes pregnant, the priest insists on an abortion, the report said. \n \n The problem travelled when the sisters were sent to Rome for studies. They \"frequently turn to seminarians and priests for help in writing essays. Sexual favors are sometimes the payment they have to make for such help,\" the report said. \n \n The reports were never meant to be made public. The U.S. National Catholic Reporter put them online in 2001, exposing the depths of a scandal the church had long sought to keep under wraps. To date, the Vatican hasn't said what, if anything, it ever did with the information. \n \n Sister Paola Moggi, a member of the Missionary Combonian Sisters \u2014 a religious congregation with a significant presence in 16 African countries \u2014 said in her experience the African church \"had made great strides\" since the 1990s, when she did missionary work in Kenya, but the problem has not been eliminated. \n \n \"I have found in Africa sisters who are absolutely emancipated and who say what they think to a priest they meet who might ask to have sex with them,\" she told the AP. \n \n \"I have also found sisters who said 'Well, you have to understand their needs, and that while we only have a monthly cycle a man has a continuous cycle of sperm' \u2014 verbatim words from the '90s,\" she said. \n \n But the fact that in just a few weeks scandals of priests allegedly molesting sisters have erupted publicly on two other continents \u2014 Asia and Latin America \u2014 suggests that the problem is not confined to Africa, and that some women are now willing to break the taboo to denounce it publicly. \n \n In India, a sister of the Missionaries of Jesus filed a police report last month alleging a bishop raped her in May 2014 during a visit to the heavily Christian state of Kerala, and that he subsequently sexually abused her around a dozen more times over the following two years, Indian media have reported. The bishop denied the accusation and said the woman was retaliating against him for having taken disciplinary action against her for her own sexual misdeeds. \n \n In Chile, the scandal of the Sisters of the Good Samaritan, an order dedicated to health care in the diocese of Talca, erupted at the same time the country's entire Catholic hierarchy has been under fire for decades of sex abuse and cover-ups. The scandal got so bad that in May, Francis summoned all Chilean bishops to Rome, where they all offered to resign en masse. \n \n The case, exposed by the Chilean state broadcaster, involves accusations of priests fondling and kissing nuns, including while naked, and some religious sisters sexually abusing younger ones. The victims said they told their mother superior, but that she did nothing. Talca's new temporary bishop has vowed to find justice. \n \n The Vatican is well aware that religious sisters have long been particularly vulnerable to abuse. Perhaps the most sensational account was detailed in the 2013 book \"The Nuns of Sant'Ambrogio,\" based on the archives of the Vatican's 1860s Inquisition trial of abuse, embezzlement, murder and \"false holiness\" inside a Roman convent. Once word got out, the Vatican poured the full force of its Inquisition to investigate and punish. \n \n It remains to be seen what the Vatican will do now that more sisters are speaking out. \n \n ___ \n \n ONE SISTER'S STORY \u2014 AND YEARS OF HURT \n \n The sister who spoke to the AP about her assault in 2000 during confession at a Bologna university clasped her rosary as she recounted the details. \n \n She recalled exactly how she and the priest were seated in two armchairs face-to-face in the university classroom, her eyes cast to the floor. At a certain point, she said, the priest got up from his chair and forced himself on her. Petite but not frail, she was so shocked, she said, that she grabbed him by the shoulders and with all her strength, stood up and pushed him back into his chair. \n \n The nun continued with her confession that day. But the assault \u2014 and a subsequent advance by a different priest a year later \u2014 eventually led her to stop going to confession with any priest other than her spiritual father, who lives in a different country. \n \n \"The place of confession should be a place of salvation, freedom and mercy,\" she said. \"Because of this experience, confession became a place of sin and abuse of power.\" \n \n She recalled at one point a priest in whom she had confided had apologized \"on behalf of the church.\" But nobody ever took any action against the offender, who was a prominent university professor. \n \n The woman recounted her story to the AP without knowing that at that very moment, a funeral service was being held for the priest who had assaulted her 18 years earlier. \n \n She later said the combination of his death and her decision to speak out lifted a great weight. \n \n \"I see it as two freedoms: freedom of the weight for a victim, and freedom of a lie and a violation by the priest,\" she said. \"I hope this helps other sisters free themselves of this weight.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Muhumuza reported from Kampala, Uganda. \n \n Have a confidential tip?

They added that they were mistreated when they reported the incidents to the superior. \n \n \u201cMy silence stings my conscience. We have more than 23 sisters who in one year were expelled from the congregation because they were sexually abused, there was abuse of authority,\u201d said Yolanda Tondreaux, who in the report charged that she was harassed by a priest. \n \n Without mentioning names, the women charged that at least three priests sexually abused the nuns. They were able to deliver their testimonies to Archbishop Charles Scicluna and Msgr. Jordi Bertomeu when they came to Chile the second time to gather information on abuse cases. \n \n Another of the complainants, Eliana Mac\u00edas, said she was abused by a priest who during the night \u201cwould go into the nuns\u2019 rooms.\u201d \n \n Consuelo G\u00f3mez charged that she was the victim of sexual abuse by nuns of the same community: \n \n The former nuns said that when they related the incidents to the superior, Patricia Ibarra G\u00f3mez, she mistreated them until they were expelled from the community. \n \n The complainants maintained that the then-local bishop Horacio Valenzuela was aware of these events but did nothing. \n \n Tondreaux, who also served in the Apostolic Nunciature of Chile, said in addition that Valenzuela and the priest Fernando Karadima \u2013 found guilty of sexual abuse by the Vatican in 2011 \u2013 received checks with huge amounts of money, without specifying from whom. \n \n On May 29 the diocesan congregation issued a statement acknowledging one case of abuse, that of Consuelo G\u00f3mez, and asked forgiveness. However, when the journalist doing the television interview consulted them regarding the new complaints they provided no comment. \n \n Bishop Galo Fern\u00e1ndez responded in the report, saying: \u201cYou see the pain there, where there\u2019s a lot of pain and situations that merit being investigated with an openness to find the truth and to listen.\u201d \n \n He also added that the former religious need to be listened to \u201cnot only in the framework of a criminal investigation in order to verify or not, but to listen so that the situations and pain they have experienced can hit home.\u201d \n \n The Apostolic Administrator stressed that the congregation of the Sisters of the Good Samaritan \u201chave a beautiful history, but that does not necessarily mean that there could not have been situations that were clearly out of line.\u201d \n \n Regarding the total lack of support the women were left in after they were expelled from the community, Galo said, \u201ca congregation clearly has a duty to care for the people that leave as well as examining the conditions under which they left. It\u2019s a duty.\u201d \n \n Finally, concerning the poor reception given to the victims by the Church authorities, the bishop said that \u201cthere\u2019s a new sensitivity today in the culture and also by the Church.\u201d \n \n \u201cThere are things that are not normal, that aren\u2019t right, and it\u2019s our responsibility to face them, correct them and where there has been a crime there certainly ought to be sanctions.\u201d \n \n This article was originally published by the Spanish language ACI Prensa.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 \"It opened a great wound inside of me. I pretended it didn't happen.\" So says a nun who claims an Italian priest sexually assaulted her while she was confessing to him about 20 years ago in Bologna. A new AP investigation finds she's not alone: Religious sisters are apparently being abused by bishops and priests in Asia, South America, Africa, and Europe, and usually keeping quiet about the assaults. That changed this week when five nuns appeared on national TV in Chile and told their stories of sexual abuse by priests and other nuns, Crux reports. It's an older story in Africa, where reports have emerged of priests abusing nuns and pressuring them into abortions; a six-year study and follow-up report for the Vatican found 29 nuns impregnated at one congregation. The National Catholic Reporter revealed that study in 2001, but what the Church did is unclear. Meanwhile, the Vatican remains quiet on the issue and lacks rules to probe and punish abusers, leaving it to local church leaders to take action. \"Consecrated women have to be encouraged to speak up when they are molested,\" says a Vatican official on the condition of anonymity. \"Bishops have to be encouraged to take them seriously, and make sure the priests are punished if guilty.\" But amid #MeToo and an ever-widening Catholic Church abuse scandal, more nuns may be speaking up for themselves. \"I see it as two freedoms: freedom of the weight for a victim, and freedom of a lie and a violation by the priest,\" says the nun allegedly assaulted in Bologna. \"I hope this helps other sisters free themselves of this weight.\"",
    "generated_summary": "\u2013 Catholic priests in Africa have been raping and impregnating nuns, according to a report from the Vatican's office for the protection of minors obtained by the National Catholic Reporter. The report cites cases as far back as 1988 in Malawi, where a bishop dismissed a leadership team of a women's congregation after it complained that 29 sisters had been impregnated by diocesan priests. In one extreme case, priests have impregnated nuns and then encouraged them to have abortions. In some cases, nuns, through naivet\u00e9, are being sexually abused by priests because they fear they could contract AIDS from sexual contact with prostitutes, says a former Vatican official. \"I think the abuse described is happening,\" says the abbot primate of the Benedictine order. \"How much it happens, what the numbers are, I have no way of knowing. But it is a serious matter, and we need to discuss it.\" A Vatican official tells the Reporter that in some countries, sisters are forced to leave their congregations when they become pregnant, while priests are allowed to continue their ministry. \"The alternative, as a matter of survival, is to go 'on the streets' as prostitutes and thereby 'expose themselves to the risk of HIV, if not already infected,'\" he writes.",

The reports allege that some Catholic clergy exploit their financial and spiritual authority to gain sexual favors from religious women, many of whom, in developing countries, are culturally conditioned to be subservient to men. In Africa particularly, a continent ravaged by HIV and AIDS, young nuns are sometimes seen as safe targets of sexual activity. In one extreme case, priests have impregnated nuns and then encouraged them to have abortions. In some cases, nuns, through naivet\u00e9 \u2013 Religious sisters in Africa are being sexually abused by priests because they fear they could contract AIDS from sexual contact with prostitutes, according to a former Vatican official. In a 1994 report, the nun wrote that priests exploited the sisters because they, too, feared being exposed to the disease, the National Catholic Reporter reports. \"I think the abuse described is happening,\" says the abbot primate of the Benedictine order. \"How much it happens, what the numbers are, I have no way of knowing. But it is a serious matter, and we need to discuss it.\" \u2013 Catholic priests in Africa have been raping and impregnating nuns, according to a new report from the Vatican's office for the protection of minors. The National Catholic Reporter, which first reported the report, says it cites cases as far back as 1988 in Malawi, where a bishop dismissed a leadership team of a women's congregation after it complained that 29 sisters had been impregnated by diocesan priests. One of those missionaries, a veteran of more than two decades in Africa, said the Malawi case was complex and the issue of sexual liaisons was not the only factor involved. \"Groups of sisters from local congregations have made passionate \u2013 The Catholic Church's sex abuse problem isn't limited to the West. It's widespread in Africa, where casual sex is common and AIDS is rampant, and it's ignored, reports the National Catholic Reporter. \"It is precisely because of our love for the church and for Africa that we feel so distressed about the problem,\" wrote the author of a 1998 report on the issue for the Vatican's Council of 16. The report cited \"sexual harassment and even rape of sisters by priests and bishops\" and noted that \"sometimes when a sister becomes pregnant, the priest insists that she have an abortion.\" The \u2013 Catholic priests and bishops in Africa are raping and harassing their own sisters, a former Vatican official says. In a report presented to the Vatican in 1998, Sister Mary McDonald wrote that sexual harassment and even rape of sisters \"is allegedly common,\" and that \"sometimes when a sister becomes pregnant, the priest insists that she have an abortion,\" the National Catholic Reporter reports. McDonald, who is now a laywoman, says the problem is widespread among African sisters, priests, and bishops. \"It is precisely because of our love for the church and for Africa that we feel so distressed about the problem,\" McDonald wrote in the report. \u2013 The Catholic Church is being accused of turning a blind eye to the sexual abuse of nuns by priests and other church officials. The scandal came to light this week when the National Catholic Reporter published a letter from the US Conference of Catholic Bishops blaming the problem on a \"conspiracy of silence\" within the church. \"I do not wish to imply that only priests and bishops are to blame and that the sisters are simply their victims,\" wrote the president of the US bishops' campaign for human development. \"No, sisters can sometimes be only too willing and can also be nave.\" A priest who spoke at a Boston College theological \u2013 Catholic priests around the world are sexually abusing nuns and pressuring them to have abortions, says a top Vatican official. In an open letter, Auxiliary Bishop Axel O'Donohue says that in some countries, sisters are forced to leave their congregations when they become pregnant, while priests are allowed to continue their ministry. \"The alternative, as a matter of survival, is to go 'on the streets' as prostitutes and thereby 'expose themselves to the risk of HIV, if not already infected,'\" he writes, per the New York Times. He says some priests have even encouraged nuns to take birth-control pills that \u2013 The Catholic Church must do more to protect its religious sisters from sexual abuse, according to a report by the National Catholic Reporter. \"The abused and others in the community 'find the foundation of their faith is suddenly shattered,'\" writes the NCR's Mary O'Donohue. \"Many whose faith has been shattered are from families that look unfavorably on religious vocations and who 'question why celibacy should be so strongly proclaimed by the same people who are seemingly involved in sexually exploiting others. This is seen as hypocrisy or at least as promoting double standards.\" A Vatican official tells the NCR that the church \u2013 The Catholic Church has ignored reports of nuns being sexually abused by priests around the world for decades, according to a new report. The report, compiled by a Benedictine nun, cites abuse in 23 countries, including the US, the National Catholic Reporter reports. \"The sisters who brought it up were deeply hurt by it and found it very painful\u2014and very painful to talk about,\" says the Benedictine nun who first raised the issue last year at a meeting of Benedictine abbots in Rome. \"We decided that it was worth also beginning to discuss in a more open way, and we had the opportunity at our regular meeting with the Congress \u2013 The nun no longer goes to confession regularly, after an Italian priest forced himself on her while she was at her most vulnerable: recounting her sins to him in a university classroom nearly 20 years ago. At the time, the sister only told her provincial superior and her spiritual director, silenced by the Catholic Church's culture of secrecy, her vows of obedience and her own fear, repulsion, and shame. \"It opened a great wound inside of me,\" she tells the AP. \"I pretended it didn't happen.\" After decades of silence, the nun is one of a handful worldwide to come forward recently on an issue \u2013 The Catholic Church's sexual abuse of nuns has long been a problem around the world, and now it's making headlines at the Vatican for the first time. The AP reports that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith\u2014the Vatican's equivalent of the US bishops' conference\u2014issued a statement Thursday acknowledging that allegations of sexual abuse and cover-up within the church were \"troubling\" and that it was investigating a complaint made by a nun in the Philippines earlier this month. The statement said the nun reported being sexually abused by a priest in the 1990s, when she was in her early 20s, \u2013 The Catholic Church has been dealing with allegations of sexual abuse by priests for decades, but a new report by the National Catholic Reporter sheds light on a much darker side: that of Catholic nuns being raped and harassed by their own priests. The report, based on confidential Vatican documents, notes that in Africa, \"harassment and rape by priests\" is \"allegedly common\" and \"sexual favors are sometimes the payment they have to make for such help.\" The sisters \"frequently turn to seminarians and priests for help in writing essays,\" the report says, and in one case, a priest demanded an abortion when a \u2013 A female nun in Italy says she was sexually assaulted by a priest 18 years ago during confession, the AP reports. The nun, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, says the assault took place in a classroom at a Bologna university. She says the priest got up from his chair and forced himself on her. \"I see it as two freedoms: freedom of the weight for a victim, and freedom of a lie and a violation by the priest,\" she says. She eventually stopped going to confession with any priest other than her spiritual father. \"Because of this experience, confession became a place of sin and abuse of \u2013 \"My silence stings my conscience,\" Yolanda Tondreaux says. \"We have more than 23 sisters who in one year were expelled from the congregation because they were sexually abused, there was abuse of authority.\" That's just one of the accusations made by five former nuns in Chile, who say they were abused by at least three priests while serving in a congregation dedicated to caring for the sick, the AP reports. The nuns, who were interviewed by Televisin Nacional de Chile, say the abuse occurred at the Congregation of the Good Samaritan, and that when they reported the abuse to a superior, she allegedly mistreated them",

    "document": "After several days of intense international discussion about its new policy against working remotely, Yahoo is trying to distance itself from the controversy. \n \n The company issued a statement to the New York Times in which it drew a line between the situation at Yahoo and flexible work policies in the rest of the economy: \n \n \u201cThis isn\u2019t a broad industry view on working from home,\" the statement said. \"This is about what is right for Yahoo right now.\u201d \n \n Yahoo issued its new ban on remote work last week. The company's goal, which many insiders support, was to foster more camaraderie, intensity, and creativity from physical interaction while also eliminating some workers who had effectively retired on the job. \n \n The ban understandably caused some grumbling from Yahoos who had joined the company precisely because they were allowed to work remotely. And then it spawned a world-wide debate in which everyone from Richard Branson to mommy bloggers weighed in. \n \n Outside Yahoo, most observers felt that CEO Marissa Mayer's decision had set back the cause of flexible work policies and work-life balance, especially for women. Inside Yahoo, meanwhile, many applauded the move. If Yahoo is to get its mojo back, these folks argued, it needs a renewed sense of commitment from everyone on the team. \n \n In any event, now, several days later, Yahoo has weighed in on the remote-work ban again, presumably seeking to dampen the criticism it has received. But, to her credit, Yahoo's new CEO, Marissa Mayer, is not backing down. \n \n If nothing else, the controversy once again demonstrates Mayer's leadership abilities. For the past decade, Yahoo has been in desperate need of a CEO who is willing to set a high bar and make the tough, unpopular decisions necessary to whip the company back into shape. \n \n In her short tenure at Yahoo, Mayer has demonstrated that she is more than capable of doing that. \n \n SEE ALSO: Yahoos Actually Support Marissa Mayer's Ban On Remote Work \n \n Disclosure: I work for Yahoo, as a part-time host of a Yahoo Finance show called Daily Ticker. I like working for Yahoo, and I would prefer to keep working for Yahoo, so if I felt like grumbling about a decision Yahoo made, I probably wouldn't do it here. I am also a Yahoo shareholder (a relic of my Internet exuberance in the late 1990s). ||||| Photo \n \n In a front-page article in The New York Times on Tuesday morning, Catherine Rampell and I wrote about Yahoo \u2019s new policy banning employees from working remotely. The company declined to comment for that article, but on Tuesday afternoon, it issued a statement about the ban against work-at-home arrangements. \n \n \u201cThis isn\u2019t a broad industry view on working from home,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThis is about what is right for Yahoo right now.\u201d \n \n A company spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the statement, saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t discuss internal matters.\u201d \n \n But based on information from several Yahoo employees, what that statement means is that Marissa Mayer, Yahoo\u2019s new chief executive, is in crisis mode, and she believes the policy is necessary to get Yahoo back into shape. \n \n The employees spoke anonymously because they are not allowed to discuss internal matters. \n \n The company also seems to be trying to distance itself from the broader national debate over workplace flexibility, and from criticism that the new policy is disruptive for employees who have family responsibilities outside work. \n \n The work ethic at Yahoo among some workers has deteriorated over time, the Yahoo employees said, and requiring people to show up is a way to keep an eye on them and re-energize the troops. If some of the least productive workers leave as a result, the thinking goes, all the better. \n \n Some employees have abused the former policy permitting work at home to the point of founding start-ups while being on salary at Yahoo, said the Yahoo employees and others who have worked at the company. \n \n Several business analysts said that if work-at-home arrangements don\u2019t work, it is generally a management problem. \n \n Yahoo\u2019s culture and employee morale have dissolved as it has fallen behind hotter tech companies. And, business analysts say, those are two things that are difficult to repair without having employees present in the same place. \n \n Still, Ms. Mayer has said many times that one of her top priorities for the company is to recruit the most talented engineers and other employees. Even if requiring people to show up is the only way to repair Yahoo\u2019s culture, it could result in losing valuable employees. \n \n And even if Yahoo\u2019s broader work-at-home policy needed revision, the internal memo announcing the new policy struck some as tone-deaf by implying that employees should avoid staying at home even once in a while when there are extenuating circumstances. \n \n \u201cFor the rest of us who occasionally have to stay home for the cable guy, please use your best judgment in the spirit of collaboration,\u201d it said.",

    "document": "Only a few weeks before his death, conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart told the audience at a CPAC rally that he possessed incriminating video tapes from President Obama's college years, tapes he would use to \"vet\" the Democratic incumbent in 2012. \n \n \"I've got videos...from his college days, to show you why racial division and class warfare are central to what 'hope' and 'change' was sold in 2008,\" Andrew Breitbart told the crowd. \"The rest of us slept while they plotted, and they plotted, and they plotted.\" \n \n Just before those tapes were supposed to be released, however, Breitbart died in Los Angeles, Calif. at age 43. And as it is only right for a man who built an online empire smearing OWS for \"raping people\" and USDA employee Shirley Sherrod for \"present tense racism,\" it only took a few hours after news of his death for several over-the-top, full-blown conspiracy theories about the Obama tapes to be launched. \n \n \"HIT JOB?\" screamed the headline by Tea Party Brief. \"Soros, Media Matters, 'Occupy', Obama, & ACORN can now breathe a sigh of relief...\" \n \n \"Was Andrew Breitbart Murdered For What He Was About To Reveal About Barack H.

That is the beauty of a conspiracy theory: it's so simple and effective, things like facts only serve to get in the way of the main message. \n \n But Twitter, used by Breitbart to in part to gleefully retweet comments against him, has now become the ultimate bastion of Breitbart-Obama conspiracy hashtagging, documented in this slideshow of the 11 most egregious and most laughable theories so far. \n \n Hundreds of Twitter users have posted their suspicions about the Internet mogul and \"cultural warrior's\" untimely death. As each minute passes, the theories as to who ordered the \"hit job\" and the contents of the tapes gets wilder and wilder. \n \n Some insist that the college videos Breitbart was about to release contain evidence that Obama had numerous gay lovers and was addicted to cocaine. \n \n Other Twitter users paint the picture of a Obama-Clinton-Bush conspiracy web, or compare Obama's \"typical\" ordered hits to the actions of genocidal Communist leader Joseph Stalin. And still others tweet that the controversial maverick may have been \"infected\" somehow with cancer, and that President Obama has an army of parasites at his disposal. \n \n Andrew Breitbart thrived on the power of a conspiracy theory, and on the impact of one controversial and sweeping statement after another.

If not I apologize. @CenLamar @dust92,\" Breitbart tweeted via his iPad at 11:25 p.m. Wednesday. \n \n Less than an hour later, the brazen commentator and conservative activist collapsed outside his California home. The cause has not been announced, but he had a history of heart problems. \n \n Today the \"putz\" in that final tweet said he wore Breitbart's insult \"as a badge of honor.\" \n \n \"I profoundly disagree with him on a number of issues\u2026 but you can't deny that Andrew Breitbart had verve and panache,\" said Lamar White Jr., who is in his first year of law school at Southern Methodist University. \n \n White and Breitbart's two-day long exchange on Twitter was a \"fluke,\" White said, which began when Breitbart retweeted an off-the-cuff remark White sent to his Twitter followers Tuesday night. \n \n \"Andrew Breitbart's speaking voice is like the love child of Owen Wilson and Dr. Evil,\" White, aka @CenLamar, tweeted after watching Breitbart speak about the Arizona and Michigan Primary results on CNN. \n \n After some feisty banter over whether James O'Keefe, Breitbart's protege, who dressed up as a pimp to make hidden camera videos of ACORN employees, was akin to Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat persona, Breitbart sarcastically called White a \"genius\" and a \"putz.\" \n \n \"He called me a putz and I said his voice sounded like Dr. Evil and Owen Wilson,\" White said, noting that in his book the two were even on the insult front. \n \n \"Twitter is just like banter,\" White said. \"I thought he was perfectly respectful and I thought it was just really cool he was talking to a law student in Dallas.\" \n \n White, a self-proclaimed progressive who was a guest blogger at the Democratic National Convention in 2008, had high praise for Breitbart, despite their opposite political views. \n \n \"This is a guy who engaged with supporters and critics alike,\" he said. \"He seemed like a pretty engaging character, somehow larger than life.\" \n \n The last person to tweet with Breitbart said he disagreed with the conspiracy theorists who flooded Twitter after his death, many accusing President Obama - whom Breitbart often criticized - of having him assassinated. \n \n \"It's a shame,\" said White, who added he sympathized with Breitbart's family, having lost his own father in a car accident when his dad was only 41 years old. \"I mean, the guy did contribute a lot. Not all of it I agree with\u2026 maybe that was the idea.\"",

    "document": "Teacher Bonuses Don\u2019t Increase Test Scores, Study Says \n \n Written By Daniel Adair on Wednesday, September 22nd, 2010 \n \n A new three-year study released on Tuesday reveals that even significant bonuses to teachers for raising student test scores fails to yield significant results. \n \n The discovery, conducted by Vanderbilt University\u2019s National Center on Performance Incentives in the metropolitan Nashville school system, compromises the view that merit pay for teachers is a viable method of increasing student performance in the classroom. The study examined about three hundred teachers of fifth to eighth-grade math teachers and the results their students received on the Tennessee standardized exams. \n \n Matthew Springer, lead researcher on the study, discusses the results: \u201cI think most people agree today that the current way in which we compensate teachers is broken. But we don\u2019t know what the better way is yet.\u201d \n \n The results are a blow against the Obama administration\u2019s new focus on linking teacher salary and tenure to their students\u2019 performance. The Department of Education was critical of the study, claiming it \u201conly looked at the narrow question of whether more pay motivates teachers to try harder,\u201d whereas the goal of the DoE is to \u201cchange the culture of teaching,\u201d only one part of which is rewarding high-performing teachers in difficult to staff schools. \n \n The American Federation of Teachers, on the other hand, praised the study, using it to emphasize their points that teachers need better training and more support administrators to better do their jobs. Merit pay is currently effectively illegal in many states, with only a handful of districts currently employing such a system. Part of the Obama administration\u2019s goal with its \u201cRace to the Top\u201d grant competition is to get more states to pass merit pay laws. \n \n Other stories that readers found helpful: ||||| Offering big bonuses to teachers failed to raise students' test scores in a three-year study released Tuesday that calls into question the Obama administration's push for merit pay to improve education. \n \n The study, conducted in the metropolitan Nashville school system by Vanderbilt University's National Center on Performance Incentives, was described by the researchers as the nation's first scientifically rigorous look at merit pay for teachers. \n \n It found that students whose teachers were offered bonuses of up to $15,000 a year for improved test scores registered the same gains on standardized exams as those whose teachers were given no such incentives. \n \n \"I think most people agree today that the current way in which we compensate teachers is broken,\" said Matthew Springer, executive director of the Vanderbilt center and lead researcher on the study. \"But we don't know what the better way is yet.\" \n \n The study comes as the Obama administration encourages school systems to link teacher pay and tenure to how students perform on tests and other measures of achievement. \n \n The researchers looked at fifth- through eighth-grade math teachers from 2007 to 2009. A group of about 300 teachers started out in the study; half were eligible for the bonuses, the other half were not. \n \n The bonuses were given out based on improvements in scores on Tennessee's standardized exam, which is used by the state as part of the federal No Child Left Behind requirements. \n \n Springer was quick to point out that his study looked only at individual bonuses, not extra pay doled out to teams of teachers or an entire school. He said more research is needed. \n \n \"Some people were initially disappointed when they saw the results, but quickly turned around and said, 'Well, at least we finally have an answer,'\" he said. \"It means pay can't do it alone.\" \n \n The U.S. Education Department called the study too narrowly focused. \n \n \"It only looked at the narrow question of whether more pay motivates teachers to try harder,\" said spokeswoman Sandra Abrevaya. \"What we are trying to do is change the culture of teaching by giving all educators the feedback they need to get better while rewarding and incentivizing the best to teach in high-need schools, hard-to-staff subjects.\" \n \n The American Federation of Teachers praised the study and argued that teachers need other resources, including better training and more supportive administrators. \n \n \"Merit pay is not the panacea that some would like it to be. There are no quick fixes in education,\" said union president Randi Weingarten. \"Providing individual bonuses for teachers standing alone does not work.\" \n \n Teachers unions have historically opposed merit pay, arguing that test scores are not an accurate measure of student achievement, that financial rewards could pit teachers against each other, and that administrators could use bonuses to reward favorites and punish others. \n \n Jennifer Conboy, a high school social studies teacher in Miami, called merit pay a \"baseless fad.\" \n \n \"Merit pay is an excuse to resist the attempt of teachers to get fair pay in the first place,\" the 37-year-old Conboy said. \"On a personal level, merit pay would do nothing to me. I took this job because I think education is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and if I cared about democracy _ which I do _ then I had a responsibility to do whatever I could to strengthen education.\" \n \n Only a few schools and districts across the country have merit pay, and in some states the idea is effectively illegal. The Obama White House hoped to encourage more states to pass merit pay laws with its $4.35 billion \"Race to the Top\" grant competition. \n \n Some states tried to enact merit bonuses for teachers, but most, like Georgia, were unable to get the necessary laws passed. Colorado passed a controversial law that ties teacher pay to student performance and allows the state to strip tenure from low-performing instructors, but the state did not win the Race to the Top grant money it was counting on to help carry out the law. \n \n Only about half of the 300 teachers originally in the Nashville study were left at the end of the three years because some retired, moved to other schools or stopped teaching math. About 40 teachers got bonuses each year. Overall, the researchers said, test scores rose modestly for both groups of students during the three-year study, suggesting that the financial incentives made no difference. \n \n \"It's not enough to say, 'I'll pay you more if you do better.' You've got to help people know how to do better,\" said Amy Wilkins, vice president of the Education Trust, a Washington think tank. \"Absolutely we should reward them once they do better, but to think merit pay alone will get them there is insane.\" \n \n (This version CORRECTS amount of Race to the Top program.)",

Caller: This is Apple security reporting a medical injury. Dispatcher: OK, what is the address of the emergency? Caller: Just a moment. Person in the background, near the caller: If you could let them know Apple Park Way. Caller: Apple Park Way. Dispatcher: What is the address? Caller: Apple Park Way. 1 Apple Park Way. Dispatcher: Can you repeat to make sure I have it correct? Caller: 1 Apple Park Way. Dispatcher: Where specifically should they go? Caller: Transit center, 5A. Dispatcher: Transit center \u2014 is that in any specific area at Apple? Caller: It\u2019s off of Tantau Avenue. Caller: Is that right at 1 Apple Park Way though? Caller: It\u2019s going to be Gate 5A off of Tantau Avenue. Dispatcher: So the address you gave me at 1 Apple Park Way is that exactly where we\u2019re going? Caller: Yes. Dispatcher: ...so tell me exactly what happened. Caller: We had an individual who ran into a glass wall pane and they hit their head. They have a small cut on their head and they are bleeding, slightly disoriented. We have on site security with them right now. Dispatcher: Are you with the patient now? Caller: No, I am not with the patient. We are trying to have a security unit call in right now so I connect you over. Dispatcher: How old is the patient? Caller: Late 20s. Dispatcher: Is the patient male or female? Caller: Male. Dispatcher: Is he awake? Caller: He is conscious. Dispatcher: Is he breathing? Caller: That we do not know. Yes, yes, he\u2019s conscious and breathing. Dispatcher: Let me go ahead here and update the paramedics. When did this happen? Caller: It happened around five minutes ago. Around 12:05. Dispatcher: Is there any serious bleeding? Caller: Yes, from the head. Dispatcher: Is he completely alert? Caller: Yes. Dispatcher: All right, one moment. Let me update the paramedics and I\u2019ll have some more instructions for you. OK, I\u2019m sending the paramedics to help you now just stay on the line and I\u2019ll tell you what exactly to do next. You can just refer this to your security. Do not move him unless he is in danger and do not splint any injuries. From now on, do not let him have anything to eat or drink, it might make him sick or cause further problems. And don\u2019t move him unless it\u2019s absolutely necessary. Tell him to be still and wait for help to arrive. I\u2019m going to give you the control bleeding instructions so they can help that ... so listen carefully and let\u2019s make sure we do it right. Get clean dry cloth or towel and place it right on the wound and tell him to press down firmly and do not lift it up to look. Caller: Press on the wound and do not look up. Dispatcher: Correct, correct. I want someone to watch him very closely. If he becomes less awake and vomits, quickly turn him on his side. Before the responders arrive \u2014 I\u2019m sure you have already done this \u2014 have someone flag down and help them guide the paramedics in. If he gets worse in any way, call us back immediately for further instructions. Caller: Will do. Dispatcher: OK, thank you. Caller: Thank you, have a nice day. Dispatcher: You too. Bye. \n \n The second injury that day appeared to be somewhat more serious, with Apple security staff unsure whether the patient was fully conscious and aware, and probably in need of stitches to repair a cut over his eye: \n \n Call 2 (January 2nd, 2018) Dispatcher: Sheriff emergency 336. What\u2019s the address of the emergency? Caller: It\u2019s going to be 1 Apple Park, Cupertino. It\u2019s going to be a medical emergency. Dispatcher: It\u2019s give me one moment\u2026 Can you verify the address of the emergency please? Caller: It\u2019s going to be 1 Apple Park Way, Cupertino. Dispatcher: OK and is that a business? What building is it in? Caller: Yes, it\u2019s going to be Apple campus. Dispatcher: What building is it in? Caller: It\u2019s going to be in the main building, section (is) the transit center, just outside of the main campus. Dispatcher: Tell me exactly what happened. Caller: OK. So we had an employee, he was on campus and he walked into a glass window, hitting his head, has a little bit of a cut on the eyebrow. Dispatcher: OK, are you with the patient now? Caller: Uh, no. I\u2019m calling from our call center. We have security on site with the patient. Dispatcher: OK, how old is the patient? Caller: Um, unknown. Dispatcher: OK, is the patient male or female? Caller: It\u2019s going to be a male, adult. Dispatcher: Is he awake? Caller: Yes. Dispatcher: Is he breathing? Caller: Yes. Dispatcher: Give me one moment. Caller: Looks like he is going to be a middle-aged male. Dispatcher: OK, and where is he bleeding from? Caller: A cut above the eyebrow. Dispatcher: Anywhere else? Caller: No. Dispatcher: Is he completely alert? Caller: Unknown at this time. We\u2019re still waiting for an update. Dispatcher: OK. Is he breathing normally? Caller: Yes, to my knowledge, yeah. Dispatcher: Is the blood spurting or pouring out? Caller: Um, I think it\u2019s just leaking \u2026 a small cut. Dispatcher: Does he have a bleeding disorder or is on blood thinners? Caller: Not to our knowledge. Dispatcher: Give me one moment to update them. Person near caller, in the background: There\u2019s a cut on the eyebrow. According to our, let\u2019s call it, first aid certified personnel it looks like it\u2019s going to (require) stitches. Dispatcher: Stay on the line, I\u201dll tell you what to do next. For now, assure him that help is on the way. Don\u2019t let him have anything to eat or drink. Might make him sick or cause further problems. Do you have a gate number? Caller: It\u2019s going to be Gate 5 on the Tantau side. Gate 5 A, 5 Adam. Dispatcher: Do not move him unless absolutely necessary. Let him be still and let him wait for help to arrive. I\u2019ll update them on the location. OK, thank you sir. Caller: Thank you very much, have a good one. \n \n The last call seems the least serious, with the patient telling dispatchers he was aware the incident was \u201cvery silly\u201d and clarifying, \u201cI didn\u2019t walk through a glass door. I walked into a glass door.\u201d The patient added he was not seriously bleeding: \n \n Call 3 (January 4th, 2018) Dispatcher: Emergency services 305. What\u2019s the address of the emergency? Caller: Hi, 1 Apple Park Way. Dispatcher: I\u2019m sorry you are breaking. What the address? Caller: 1 Apple Park Way. Dispatcher: OK. Is this a building or room number? Caller: It\u2019s going to be in section 9, fourth floor. You are going to go in through the Transit Center, which is Gate 5A, A as in Adam. I have Jessica on the line who is with the patient who hit his head on the glass. Dispatcher: OK. Hello? Tell me exactly what happened. Caller 2: Let me have the gentleman it happened to speak for himself. Dispatcher: That\u2019s OK. Ma\u2019am? Hello? Hi, sir? Patient: Hi, yes. Dispatcher: Tell me exactly what happened. Patient: Um, I walked into a glass door on the first floor of Apple Park when I was trying to go outside, which was very silly. Dispatcher: You keep breaking up. You walked through a glass door? Patient: I didn\u2019t walk through a glass door. I walked into a glass door. Dispatcher: OK, one second. Did you injure your head? Patient: I hit my head. Dispatcher: How old are you? Patient: 23. Dispatcher: Hold on one second, OK. When did this happen? Patient: About a half an hour ago. Dispatcher: Is there any serious bleeding? Patient: No. Dispatcher: Just one moment. Just one second while I update the paramedics, just stay on the line. I\u2019m sending the paramedics to help you now. I\u2019ll tell you exactly what to do next. Do not move unless you are in danger and do not splint any injuries, OK? Help is on the way. From now don\u2019t have anything to eat or drink, it might make you sick or cause further problems. And don\u2019t move around unless it is absolutely necessary. Just be still and wait for help to arrive, OK? I\u2019m going to give you some instructions before I let you go. Before the responders arrive, please put away any pets, gather your medication and if anything changes, call us back immediately for further instructions, OK? Patient: OK. Dispatcher: I\u2019ll stay with you on the line as long as I can and if anything changes, let me know. Tell me when the paramedics arrive. Caller 2: We\u2019re in a locked area of the building. Do I need to meet them to escort them to this area? Caller 1: This is Lauren, from Apple security. We have some officers on site and who will go ahead and let the EMS through. For the dispatcher, it\u2019s through Gate 5A, as in Adam near the transit center on Tantau where you will be entering. Dispatcher: That\u2019s what I have \u2026 I\u2019ll go ahead and disconnect with you \u2026 Thank you. \n \n Advertisement \n \n These are just the injuries we know about. The facility has been open to staff since April 2017, while this is just three days\u2019 worth of 911 calls. It\u2019s possible that this could be somewhat of a never-ending problem, as Bloomberg reported Apple discouraged employees from ad hoc solutions like marking doors with post-it notes, while its moderately high turnover rate could result in newer hires remaining aloof on the issue until that terrible second of revelation. A search of OSHA records found no applicable results. \n \n The Apple building\u2019s design was the result of a relentless focus on aesthetics and form that Reuters reported was driven by the Apple team\u2019s belief that even standard features like doorway thresholds could distract engineers\u2019 lines of thought. In other words, the company wanted the building to allow staff to move quickly and without distractions or even physical cues as they moved throughout the spaceship, which sounds great until they started bonking into invisible barriers like someone who wandered into the house from Thirteen Ghosts. \n \n Were one to assign blame here, they might take some cues from experts in safe working environments who pay close attention to preventable hazards. According to the Chronicle\u2019s account, Apple was given plenty of warning from local government officials. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \u201cWe did recognize that this is going to be an issue, especially when they clean the glass,\u201d Cupertino building official Albert Salvador told the paper. \u201cWhen you clean the windows, you can\u2019t even tell some of them are there.\u201d \n \n He added that while visiting the Apple campus with the Santa Clara County Fire Department\u2019s Dirk Mattern, they were discussing the issue with a contractor when another walked directly into the glass. \n \n \u201cThat helped form our point,\u201d Salvador concluded. \n \n [San Francisco Chronicle] \n \n ||||| Below are transcripts of three 911 calls from Apple\u2019s new campus, obtained by The Chronicle via a public-records request. The calls, all made in January, relate to injuries suffered by people who walked into glass at the campus, which is called Apple Park. The transcript has been lightly edited.

    "document": "Senior staffers on the House Judiciary Committee helped Donald Trump's top aides draft the executive order curbing immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations, but the Republican committee chairman and party leadership were not informed, according to multiple sources involved in the process. \n \n The news of their involvement helps unlock the mystery of whether the White House consulted Capitol Hill about the executive order, one of many questions raised in the days after it was unveiled on Friday. It confirms that the small group of staffers were among the only people on Capitol Hill who knew of the looming controversial policy. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Kathryn Rexrode, the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s communications director, declined to comment about the aides\u2019 work. A Judiciary Committee aide said Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) was not \"consulted by the administration on the executive order.\" \n \n \"Like other congressional committees, some staff of the House Judiciary Committee were permitted to offer their policy expertise to the Trump transition team about immigration law,\" a House Judiciary Committee aide said in a statement. \"However, the Trump Administration is responsible for the final policy decisions contained in the executive order and its subsequent roll-out and implementation.\u201d \n \n The work of the committee aides began during the transition period after the election and before Donald Trump was sworn in. The staffers signed nondisclosure agreements, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Trump's transition operation forced its staff to sign these agreements, but it would be unusual to extend that requirement to congressional employees. Rexrode declined to comment on the nondisclosure pacts. \n \n It\u2019s extremely rare for administration officials to circumvent Republican leadership and work directly with congressional committee aides. But the House Judiciary Committee has some of the most experienced staffers when it comes to immigration policy. \n \n \n \n \n \n GOP leaders received no advance warning or briefings from the White House or Judiciary staff on what the executive order would do or how it would be implemented \u2014 briefings they still had not received as of Sunday night. Leaders including Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) only saw the final language when reporters received it Friday night, according to multiple Hill sources. \n \n Rather, Republicans on the Hill spent the entire weekend scrambling to find out what was going on, who was involved and how it was that they were caught so flat-footed. \n \n \"Their coordination with the Hill was terrible,\" said one senior GOP source on the Hill, who seemed flabbergasted that congressional Republicans didn\u2019t receive talking points from the White House on the executive order until late Saturday night, about 24 hours after President Donald Trump signed it. \u201cWe didn't see the final language until it was actually out.\u201d \n \n The fumbled roll-out serves as a cautionary tale to Trump officials who decide to go it alone in enacting controversial policies without help from Congress. Indeed, the lack of consultation has set off a wave of resentment on Capitol Hill. GOP insiders believe that the White House and Goodlatte staffers could have avoided the drama that unfolded over the weekend had they looped in relevant lawmakers on the front end. \n \n The episode also has instilled a wariness among GOP aides about the White House. \n \n \u201cThese executive orders were very rushed and drafted by a very tight-knit group of individuals who did not run it by the people who have to execute the policy. And because that\u2019s the case, they probably didn\u2019t think of or care about how this would be executed in the real world,\u201d said another congressional source familiar with the situation. \u201cNo one was given a heads-up and no one had a chance to weigh in on it.\u201d \n \n Insiders told POLITICO that the botched roll-out of the immigration executive order was coordinated for the most part by White House policy director Stephen Miller, a former Sessions staffer, and Trump senior strategist Stephen Bannon. \n \n It was intentionally kept quiet. Even key administration officials had not seen it until \"just before it was going out,\" according to one White House source. \n \n A Judiciary Committee aide said Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) was not \"consulted by the administration on the executive order.\" | AP Photo \n \n Since the staffers did not inform Republican leaders about their work, Hill leaders and the House Homeland Security panels were never given the chance to vet the order for potential problems \u2014 such as the issue with green card holders that caused authorized U.S. immigrants to be threatened with deportation at airports. \n \n Even supporters of the administration believe the administration erred in its lack of communication. Former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally, speculated that the administration could have given \"people a heads up a week or so out and get them on the same page.\u201d But he cautioned that the administration is \u201cunderstaffed and Trump is impatient,\u201d and the White House has a natural learning curve. \n \n \u201cThey could have waited a couple days, and they would have done better,\u201d Gingirich said. \"I think some of this stuff is they're learning how to roller skate. They can't understand in advance, they have to do it for the first time.\u201d \n \n When the order first came down Friday, and reports of problems started to surface, lawmakers frantically called leadership offices and committees staff to ask how to respond. That\u2019s when GOP leadership staffers moved to do damage control \u2014 even as the administration ignored their requests for briefings and more information. Frustrated by the administration\u2019s lack of communication to reporters on what the executive order did and didn\u2019t do, they tried to pick up the slack by emphasizing that the ban was not a prohibition on Muslims. \n \n \u201cWe were trying to clean up their damage,\" a senior Republican source said. \"The thing was getting totally mischaracterized. The way it was implemented was screwing over a lot of people.\" \n \n The White House has now dispatched aides to speak with Capitol Hill staffers before they make policy moves, a person familiar with the matter said. Boris Epshteyn, a senior aide, attended such a meeting Monday. \n \n Homeland Security Director John Kelly is expected to visit Capitol Hill on Tuesday and has told others he was \"kept totally out of the loop,\" one person familiar with his comments said. \n \n Hill Republicans on Monday were privately simmering that administration officials didn\u2019t seek out their expertise. Most Trump officials lack policy chops and Washington know-how, they argued, and Republicans said they could have been helpful. \n \n One senior GOP aide said that they generally understood Trump's goals to limit immigration, \u201cbut we're getting tired of all the chaos.\u201d \n \n ||||| White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, left, speaks Saturday with White House chief strategist Steve Bannon in the Oval office as President Trump speaks on the phone with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. (Drew Angerer/Getty Images) \n \n The fallout Monday from President Trump\u2019s sweeping immigration order exposed painful rifts within the Republican Party, alarmed members of his Cabinet and fueled suspicions among his top advisers. \n \n That left the defiant commander in chief stewing over who was to blame \u2014 capped by Trump\u2019s remarkable decision late Monday to fire the acting attorney general because she refused to enforce the order as potentially unlawful. \n \n For all the promises of Republican bonhomie, Trump and his aides kept GOP congressional leaders almost completely in the dark about the most consequential act of his young presidency: a temporary ban on refugees and on anyone from seven majority-Muslim nations. \n \n Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly fumed privately to associates over the weekend because they had been caught unaware by a travel ban that was drafted and set into action largely in secret by the White House, according to three people who have spoken with them. \n \n Inside the West Wing, tensions flared as differences in management style emerged between two factions: one led by chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, who wrote the immigration order, and the other composed of Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and his deputies, who are accustomed to operating with a more traditional chain of command. \n \n (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post) \n \n Miller, 31, was the public face of the order and the populist wing of the White House over the weekend, directing department and agency chiefs as well as explaining and defending the move in television interviews. \n \n As it became evident that the rollout of the executive order bordered between clumsy and dysfunctional, people in Trump\u2019s orbit divided over who was at fault, with some blaming Miller. Others said it was Priebus who should have taken charge of better coordinating with the departments and communicating with lawmakers and the public. \n \n \u201cThe problem they\u2019ve got is this is an off-Broadway performance of a show that is now the number one hit on Broadway,\u201d said former House speaker Newt Gingrich, an informal adviser to Trump. \n \n [The first days inside Trump\u2019s White House: Fury, tumult and a reboot] \n \n The infighting spilled into public view Monday morning on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d Host Joe Scarborough, who spent part of Sunday visiting Trump at the White House, looked into the camera and directly challenged Miller. \n \n \u201cThis weekend was a disgrace and it\u2019s all on your shoulders,\u201d Scarborough intoned. \n \n His commentary was all but certain to be noticed by the president himself; Trump is such an avid watcher of the show that when Sen.

It\u2019s not realistic. It\u2019s not practical,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cI strongly agree with the general direction we\u2019re going, but I think this particular fight doesn\u2019t emotionally make any sense.\u201d \n \n In many ways, Trump\u2019s leading advisers are simply operating within the power parameters the president established. Some officials \u2014 Bannon and Miller chief among them \u2014 are actively shaping policy and guiding the president\u2019s decisions. Others \u2014 such as Priebus, the deputy chiefs of staff and White House press secretary Sean Spicer \u2014 function in a more reactive capacity, left trying to find order in chaos and explain away slapdash actions. \n \n The Priebus-Bannon relationship has had its warm moments. When Priebus\u2019s wife was recently baptized into the Greek Orthodox Church, Bannon attended the reception. \n \n The competing power dynamic appears to have made Priebus, in particular, suspicious of his colleagues\u2019 motives, especially as Bannon asserts his influence, according to several people with knowledge of the situation. \n \n \u201cA little bit of under-competence and a slight amount of insecurity can breed some paranoia and backstabbing,\u201d one White House official, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said of Priebus. \u201cWe have to get Reince to relax into the job and become more competent, because he\u2019s seeing shadows where there are no shadows.\u201d \n \n During the transition phase, for instance, Priebus maneuvered to sideline perceived threats. He suggested that Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent New York financier who is close to Trump and Bannon, serve outside the administration, as finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to two people aware of the discussions. \n \n But Scaramucci demurred, opting for a senior White House job directing the Office of Public Liaison and Intergovernmental Affairs, a similar role to the one played by Valerie Jarrett in the Obama White House. \n \n White House officials reject the notion that chaos has overshadowed the early days of Trump\u2019s presidency. They say the media refuse to acknowledge his achievements and intentionally tried to stoke public dissent, even hysteria, with reports about the immigration order. \n \n \u201cWhile false narratives circulate, the White House staff is busy working, together, to implement President Trump\u2019s agenda for the betterment of our country,\u201d said a White House spokesman who was not authorized to speak on the record. \n \n Trump fired off angry tweets attacking the media and lawmakers who criticized his ban, from mocking Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) for his \u201ctears\u201d to labeling Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) \u201csadly weak.\u201d \n \n Late Monday evening, Trump fired acting attorney general Sally Yates, who had instructed Justice Department lawyers not to defend Trump\u2019s immigration order. The White House said in a statement that Yates had \u201cbetrayed\u201d the Justice Department and called her \u201cvery weak on illegal immigration.\u201d \n \n Privately, the president seethed, venting about what he saw as unfair news coverage on a second straight weekend of mass protests, and quizzing confidants about their impressions of how his senior staffers were performing. \n \n [Donald Trump waits in his tower \u2014 accessible, yet isolated] \n \n As the controversy swirled, Trump, who has taken to giving visitors mini-tours of his new residence, found comfort in a trio of loyalists who share a room just steps from the Oval Office \u2014 Hope Hicks, the spokeswoman who has been at Trump\u2019s side since before his campaign launch; Johnny McEntee, a former college football quarterback who is now the president\u2019s personal aide; and Keith Schiller, a retired New York police officer and head of Trump\u2019s personal security detail who now directs Oval Office operations. \n \n Nonetheless, some of Trump\u2019s friends as well as his critics fear that his agenda may be compromised by mismanagement. \n \n \u201cFrankly, when I look at this, I think he was ill-served by his staff,\u201d said Ohio Gov. John Kasich, one of Trump\u2019s primary rivals. \u201cIf I were the president, I\u2019d be very upset with the staff \u2014 that they didn\u2019t say, \u2018Hey, wait, hold on a second.\u2019 Because that\u2019s what executives do. They have people around them that help them to understand, \u2018Hey, your message is fine but here is what\u2019s going to come from it.\u2019 \u201d \n \n On Capitol Hill, many Republicans close to leadership were frustrated that they received little to no guidance, or advance notice, about Trump\u2019s immigration and refu\u00adgee directive. One top House office said it was able to glean the president\u2019s plan only through unofficial back channels to the Department of Homeland Security. \n \n Asked if he was consulted in drafting the order, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Tex.) replied simply, \u201cI wasn\u2019t\u201d \u2014 an echo of Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), who told reporters Monday that the White House had not briefed him before signing the order. \n \n The first substantive guidance to congressional Republicans came late Saturday \u2014 well after protesters had descended on the nation\u2019s airports \u2014 in a two-page memo that offered some details on the policy but, to the chagrin of several Capitol Hill aides, very little political guidance. At the end was a pledge for the secretary of state to report regularly on \u201cvictims of female genital mutilation or honor killing by foreign-born nationals.\u201d \n \n It was not only Trump\u2019s immigration order that rankled official Washington. His presidential memorandum that restructured the National Security Council to elevate Bannon to a seat on the Principals Committee, alongside the secretaries of state and defense, worried many in the national security community. Also concerning was language suggesting that the director of national intelligence and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff could only attend certain Principals Committee meetings. \n \n But Spicer told reporters Monday that Trump was revising the directive to also include the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. And he insisted that the DNI and Joint Chiefs chairman would be included in any Principals Committee meeting they wish to attend. \n \n The confusion out of the White House about the president\u2019s intentions left some of the government\u2019s most decorated officials scrambling to assert their relevance.

A senior administration official initially said over the weekend that \"top immigration experts on Capitol Hill\" drafted the executive action. \"Republicans on Capitol Hill wrote it,\" the official told pool reporters on Sunday. \n \n White House spokesperson Sean Spicer doubled down on congressional involvement during a press briefing on Monday. Asked about Capitol Hill staff who say they weren't briefed on the executive order, Spicer turned the question back on reporters: \"535 offices, plus territories, you talked to them all?\" \n \n \"As was told to you last night, there were staff from appropriate committees and leadership offices that were involved,\" Spicer said. \n \n However, many Republican and Democratic members were not briefed on the final version of the executive order before Trump signed it on Friday, including the entire House Homeland Security committee and at least some members of the Senate Homeland Security committee. \n \n \"The House Homeland Security committee was not consulted on the final draft of the executive order,\" said a GOP aide. \n \n \n \n And while some Republican members have said that the order is similar to legislation passed by the House last year after the Paris attacks, it includes new language on current US green card and visa holders that shocked many members of Congress. \n \n \"Total BS,\" a senior Republican aide familiar with the matter said in response to Spicer's assertion Monday that the \"appropriate committees\" were briefed on the order. \"We got an eleventh-hour phone call the day of to let us know it was about to happen. Precisely zero formal consultation before that, just like [the Department of Homeland Security] itself.\" \n \n \n \n Sen. Rob Portman, a member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, criticized the lack of scrutiny given to the order before it was signed, saying on CNN this weekend that \"an extreme vetting program that wasn't properly vetted.\" His spokesman Kevin Smith told BuzzFeed News in an email Monday that \"Senator Portman and his staff were not consulted about the EO in advance of its rollout.\" \n \n Similarly, Sen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was not consulted or briefed on the order, an aide confirmed on Monday. \"I think they understand that this was not handled in the most productive manner,\" Corker told Bloomberg. \n \n The senior Republican aide familiar with the matter said that while some lawmakers had seen an early draft of the order, they were blindsided by the contents of the final version and did not see it until it was made public Friday night. \n \n \"Friday we were operating under the assumption that the draft executive order that had circulated earlier in the week was going to reflect the final version,\" the source said. \"There didn't appear to be too many issues.\" \n \n But \"it was hours\" before members and staff saw the final version of the executive action signed Friday by Trump \"because coordination was so poor,\" the aide added. \n \n \"By the time we digested the changes and reviewed the final order, it was clear there were serious shortcomings and problems,\" the source said. \n \n One of the problems for some Republican members is the fact that the ban was being used to halt people with valid US visas and green cards at US airports over the weekend, instead of just temporarily stopping the issuance of new visas, which the source called a \"major red flag.\" \n \n \"It was chaotic and very uncoordinated and it caused not only a lot of concern and problems on Capitol Hill, it caused obviously a big PR backlash for the administration,\" the first Republican aide said. \"They seemed to sit and watch for about 48 hours before they decided to come out\" and clarify that green card holders and permanent residents weren't included in the ban. \n \n \"It was a total cluster [...] It was a complete cluster and the organization and the coordination really needs to improve dramatically and quickly,\" the aide added. \n \n Democrats on the two Homeland Security committees were apparently not briefed on the executive order either, two Democratic sources said. One Senate Democratic office said they were given a draft of the order early on by an \"advocacy group,\" which the aide declined to identify, but noted, as Republicans did, that the draft they saw was significantly different from what Trump signed. It's unclear if the draft viewed by Democrats was the same one that Republicans viewed. \n \n \u201cWe got no notice. We got no briefing, we got nothing from the administration,\" the Democratic aide said. \n \n The executive order that Trump signed Friday halted travel to the US for citizens of Iran, Iraq, Syria, Somalia, Sudan, Libya, and Yemen. It also suspended the US refugee program for four months and indefinitely halted the resettlement of Syrian refugees in the US. \n \n After the executive order was signed, border agents detained more than 100 people \u2014 including US green card holders and small children \u2014 at airports across the US, prompting protests in more than a dozen major cities. \n \n \n \n Republicans on Capitol Hill began publicly criticizing Trump's executive order as public outcry amplified throughout the weekend. On Sunday evening, House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul issued a statement saying \"it is clear adjustments are needed\" after telling cable news channels on Friday that Trump's executive orders made it \"a safer day for America.\" \n \n \"In the future, such policy changes should be better coordinated with the agencies implementing them and with Congress to ensure we get it right\u2014and don\u2019t undermine our nation\u2019s credibility while trying to restore it,\u201d McCaul said in the Sunday statement. \n \n The New York Times reported that Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly was only briefed on the executive order as Trump signed it. \n \n The White House has continued to defend the ban, claiming it will protect the country against terrorists, despite global confusion about how it should be interpreted and court orders seeking to overturn it. Trump tweeted on Saturday that the US \"needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW.\" \n \n Countries whose dual citizens would be affected were left scrambling over the weekend as well. In Canada, for instance \u2014 where at least 35,000 people share nationality with one of the seven banned countries \u2014 the prime minister's national security advisor said first learned of Trump's executive order in the media. \n \n Sarah Mimms contributed to this report.",

    "document": "You know setting aside money for retirement is smart, but you don\u2019t know anything about how it works. You need advice. Where do you turn? \n \n Maybe you have a financially savvy friend or family member. But a lot of people turn to professional advisers. \n \n Until now there have been two different kinds of investment advisers: those who are required to work in your best interests, and those who \u2014 amazingly \u2014 are not. \n \n But a new rule from the Department of Labor, which becomes final today, aims to change that. Under the new rule, savers will gain the right to sue or initiate arbitration against advisers who don\u2019t meet high ethical standards or who fail to disclose conflicts. \n \n The effect, say both experts and many industry advocates, will be to drive many advisers to change their business models, while pushing others entirely out of the business. \n \n And that\u2019s probably a good thing. \n \n The new rule will require retirement advisers to act in their clients\u2019 interests \n \n The Department of Labor developed the new standards over the past few years, as part of a larger regulatory effort to reduce risk for middle-class savers after the 2008 financial crisis. \n \n The two kinds of retirement savings pros are called \"registered investment advisers\" and \"broker-dealers.\" Registered advisers \u2014 who often work with wealthier, more sophisticated clients \u2014 are required to uphold fiduciary standards, a special legal arrangement most often associated with lawyers and doctors. They are required to work in the best interests of their clients and can be punished for doing otherwise. Registered advisers are paid directly by their clients, and generally charge based on the size of the fund they manage. \n \n \"Broker-dealers,\" on the other hand, are often more like salespeople (a dealer is a broker who works independently). They\u2019re often paid commissions, increasing their incentive to suggest products with higher fees. Many also receive \"revenue-sharing\" payments from the banks and mutual funds that generate the investments the brokers sell, again potentially influencing them to steer savers toward products that charge more. \n \n The suggestions broker-dealers make to clients are held to a \"suitability standard.\" That is, brokers are required to only propose products that are appropriate for the saver given his or her age, retirement goals, etc. \n \n \"I've never met anyone who's going to go to a dealership to ask advice about whether to buy a new car\" \n \n What brokers dole out is \"advice\" in the conventional sense, but the current rules don\u2019t require it to be particularly good, or even fully well-meaning. \n \n \"A sales pitch where they're going to get a huge commission isn't \u2018advice,\u2019\" says Betsey Stevenson, a professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan and a former member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers (CEA) who co-authored its report on the rule. \n \n \"Car salesmen get commissions, and everyone\u2019s fine with that,\" she adds. \"But I've never met anyone who's going to go to a dealership to ask advice about whether to buy a new car or take the bus.\" \n \n Savers lose a lot of money because of conflicted advice \n \n A decades-long shift from traditional pensions to 401(k) savings plans means more people than ever are responsible for deciding where to invest their own retirement savings. \n \n The CEA\u2019s report, published in February 2015, found that bad advice from conflicted broker-dealers reduced savers\u2019 returns by about 1 percent a year \u2014 as much as $17 billion a year nationwide. \n \n The greatest losses occur when workers roll their 401(k) balance into a higher-fee individual retirement account when leaving a job, rather than keeping it with their former employers. \n \n \"A typical worker who receives conflicted advice when rolling over a 401(k) balance to an IRA at age 45 will lose an estimated 17 percent from her account by age 65,\" the CEA\u2019s report said. The report adds that if there is $100,000 in that account, it could grow to $216,000 in 20 years without the bad advice, as opposed to $179,000 with the conflict of interest. \n \n Opponents say conflicts of interest aren't a problem \n \n Opponents of the new rules argue that most brokers already act the way regulators want them to. \n \n \"If you don\u2019t help someone, they\u2019re not going to continue with you as a client,\" said Lisa Bleier, managing director at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, an industry group, in a December interview. \n \n Bleier said the Labor Department\u2019s proposed rules were haphazard, applying only to retirement advisers and not to investment advisers generally. They\u2019d require savers to sign extra contracts, including one the moment they walk in the door, she said, and would expose brokers to frivolous lawsuits. \n \n Stevenson argues that most savers would be fine with so-called \"robo advice\" from online services \n \n I pressed Bleier on the ethical issues involved in advisers receiving commissions or revenue-sharing arrangements. \"I don\u2019t see those compensation structures as a problem, no,\" Bleier responded. \"The SEC has approved them.\" \n \n The new rule will probably drive a lot of advisers out of the business \n \n Both Stevenson, the professor and former Obama administration economist, and Bleier agree on one likely effect of the rules: A lot of brokers will stop serving middle-class clients. \n \n Broker-dealers will have three options: \n \n They can operate as they do now, but adhere to the new standards. Because it\u2019ll be harder to steer clients toward high-fee products, they\u2019ll make lower commissions \u2014 while still risking lawsuits from disgruntled clients. \n \n They could move away from commissions, charging the client a fixed fee the way registered advisers do. \n \n They could give up advising entirely. \n \n In late 2012, the UK passed a set of regulations that were similar to the Obama proposal \u2014 but stronger. The regulations not only imposed a fiduciary standard on retirement brokers, but also banned nearly all commissions, while also strengthening disclosure and professional training requirements. \n \n The result: The number of advisers in the UK fell from about 27,080 in 2009 to 23,640 in 2014, a reduction of about 13 percent, according to the Association of Professional Financial Advisers. \n \n The revenue generated by advisers was impacted as well. Advisers\u2019 total income never fell, but it stopped growing for three years, from 2011 to 2013. But growth resumed in 2014 with a surge of fee-based income replacing a very large drop in commissions. (Outside factors like the eurozone debt crisis likely influenced advisers\u2019 revenue, as well.) \n \n In the years since the new rules went into effect, both government and industry have expressed concern about a growing \"advice gap\" for middle- and lower-income retirement savers. While regulators have said it's difficult to measure the gap \u2014 measuring something customers aren\u2019t doing \u2014 a research firm called Fundscape found, based on survey data, that many advisers were turning away investors who had less than about $148,000 in total assets. The average British investor has a portfolio of about $30,000. \n \n Bleier and Stevenson both believe something similar will happen here in the United States \u2014 less wealthy clients simply can\u2019t afford the upfront fees charged by non-conflicted investment advisers. But while Bleier sees that as a big problem, Stevenson disagrees. \n \n Stevenson argues that most savers would be fine with so-called robo advice from online services that use data and algorithms to offer advice based on savers' specifications. Another option: They can read the Vox guide to retirement savings. \n \n \"It\u2019s not about good guys and bad guys,\" said Stevenson. \"These guys are just trying to feed their families. And if they can offer a product where they get a $500 commission versus one where they get an $800 commission \u2014 they don\u2019t want to give bad advice, but what if it\u2019s hard to tell?\" \n \n With the fiduciary rule, the government aims to resolve that tension and legally obligate advisers to put aside their self-interest. The result for savers, though, won\u2019t necessarily be better advice. It could be less advice, at least of the kind you get from human beings. \n \n But that\u2019s okay. Most people don\u2019t need much advice, because the principles of saving for retirement aren\u2019t complicated: Save 20 percent of your income, invest in low-cost index funds, and don\u2019t touch the money until you reach your retirement age. ||||| Arthur Levitt Jr. is a former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and a director of Bloomberg LP. \n \n Ronald Reagan used to say that the surest way to live forever was to become a federal program. If that\u2019s right, the surest way to die is to be studied by Congress. In Washington, becoming the subject of legislative scrutiny virtually guarantees inaction, the disappearance of funding and political support, and ultimate demise. \n \n That\u2019s precisely why congressional Republicans are insisting on the need to \u201cstudy\u201d further an Obama administration proposal to make financial advisers more accountable. The proposal in question, put forward by the Department of Labor, would target the conflicts of interest that can arise when advisers attempt to steer their clients into high-fee, high-risk investments. \n \n The Labor Department is attempting to update the fiduciary standard, raising the bar for any advice given by brokers working with retirement investors. If instituted, financial advisers will have to place a client\u2019s interests above their own or those of their firm. That doesn\u2019t seem like too hard a standard to meet, but not all advisers deliver on it. And to this point, nothing in the law has made them do so. \n \n A change is long overdue. The current proposal has already been studied at length, while the public and affected industries have had their chance to examine the rule, comment on it and suggest changes. Labor Department researchers estimate that the regulation would save more than $40 billion over 10 years in retirement savings. \n \n Republicans and some Democrats in Congress would apparently rather leave America\u2019s investing public exposed to advisers who serve themselves first and their clients second. But rather than put forward their own ideas to address this problem, they\u2019re attempting to dictate new parameters for the rule that would require it to be rewritten, thus running out the clock before President Barack Obama leaves office. \n \n As a former broker, I cannot accept the argument that brokers are simply order-takers rather than advisers. Responding to customers\u2019 directions and anxieties invariably involves a dialogue that veers into the area of advice and counsel. \n \n As chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 1990s, I\u2019m also intimately familiar with the tactic of \u201cstudy to kill.\u201d Then, too, the Republicans in control of Congress used the maneuver to stymie important new rules to protect investors. \n \n In that case, I wanted to keep audit and accounting firms from selling consulting and other high-margin services to their audit clients. My fear was that the audit process -- which is dependent on independence and objectivity -- would be infected by concerns over losing other client work. An audit might be toned down in hopes of winning a lucrative consulting gig from the same client. Or auditors might not share important information with an audit committee so as not to embarrass managers critical to their success on other projects. The risk of self-dealing appeared to be great. \n \n My fears were well-placed. Major audit firms were later discovered to have allowed such conflicts of interest to affect their judgment; the resulting audits were not of consistently high quality. By the time the proposed rules had finally found their way into law in the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, it was too late and investors had lost billions of dollars in the 2001-2002 market meltdown and recession. \n \n Congress is in danger of repeating that mistake. The Labor Department has put forward a proposal after years of vetting, held four days of public hearings and considered comments from thousands of people. There\u2019s no reason to study the issue further, nor any legitimate argument against the proposal itself. A vote to delay the rule further is a vote to kill the rule -- that\u2019s how things work in Washington. \n \n Among America\u2019s middle-class families, who are struggling to save enough for college and retirement and life\u2019s other big-ticket items, this delay is going to cost money. Billions of dollars in fees will be paid to unscrupulous advisers who aren\u2019t being held to account.

    "reference_summary": "\u2013 Americans trying to save for retirement might be pleased to learn that a new law expected next year will require something that sounds obvious: All financial advisers will be required to work in their clients' best interests. As Vox explains, that is \"amazingly\" not the case now. Two kinds of advisers currently exist: \"Registered investment advisers,\" who tend to work with the wealthy, are held to high fiduciary standards akin to the standards of doctors and lawyers, and they must indeed work in the best interests of their clients.

The financial industry had mounted a \"last-minute battle\" to kill the provision, but it fell short, reports the Wall Street Journal. As a result, the Labor Department is expected to draft the legislation in January ahead of its implementation later in the year. Proponents say that it will save people big money in their IRAs and 401(k)s, while the industry argues that it will drive many brokers out of business and thus put the price of getting investment advice out of reach for many.

Though Harding was the first American woman to complete a triple axel in competition, her legacy was forever defined by her association with an infamous, ill-conceived, and even more poorly executed attack on fellow Olympic competitor Nancy Kerrigan. Featuring an iconic turn by Margot Robbie as the fiery Harding, a mustachioed Sebastian Stan as her impetuous ex-husband Jeff Gillooly, a tour-de-force performance from Allison Janney as her acid-tongued mother, LaVona Golden, and an original screenplay by Steven Rogers, Craig Gillespie's I, TONYA is an absurd, irreverent, and piercing portrayal of Harding's life and career in all of its unchecked--and checkered--glory. \n \n Rating: R (for pervasive language, violence, and some sexual content/nudity) \n \n Genre: Drama \n \n Directed By: Craig Gillespie \n \n Written By: Steven Rogers \n \n On Disc/Streaming: Mar 13, 2018 \n \n Box Office: $28,950,158 \n \n Runtime: 119 minutes \n \n Studio: NEON ||||| type Movie genre Drama release date 12/08/17 performer Margot Robbie, Allison Janney, Sebastian Stan director Craig Gillespie mpaa R \n \n We gave it an A- \n \n In a sport of princesses, Tonya Harding was the perpetual toad: a trashy, too-brash outsider whose mind-blowing axels and sheer athleticism could never quite make up for the fact that she didn\u2019t fit the demure, spangled mold of an ideal figure skater. Raised but hardly nurtured by a chain-smoking waitress (Allison Janney, a viper in Tootsie glasses and a mushroom-cap haircut), Tonya steadily clawed her way up the junior ranks, thanks mostly to pure willpower and the proxy parenting of a coach (Julianne Nicholson) who tried her best to steer her wild-card charge. What set Harding\u2019s destiny, though, was the arrival of Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), the dim-bulb paramour and protector whose wonky scheme to take down his wife\u2019s rival Nancy Kerrigan would go down in Olympics infamy. \n \n Director Craig Gillespie (Lars and the Real Girl) frames the movie as a faux documentary stuffed with flashbacks, talking heads, and fourth-wall-breaking asides. His form of satire can be a blunt instrument; it\u2019s hard to tell sometimes whether he wants to be the Coen brothers, Christopher Guest, or just Spinal Tap on ice. But he\u2019s also working from a script where the truth was irrefutably stranger than any fiction. And though the physical abuse Harding endures leaves an ugly bruise on its high-camp \u201990s nostalgia, there\u2019s something genuinely electric about the narrative\u2019s headlong tumble into madness. The skating scenes, too, are thrilling, but Robbie is the real revelation. In a performance that goes far beyond bad perms and tabloid punchlines, she\u2019s a powerhouse: a scrappy, defiant subversion of the American dream. You won\u2019t just find yourself rooting for this crazy kid; you might even fall a little bit in love. A- ||||| You probably haven\u2019t thought about Tonya Harding much recently. Truly, why would you? The Olympic figure skater reached the height of her fame nearly a quarter century ago for something that didn\u2019t even happen on the ice: the notorious attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan, orchestrated by Harding\u2019s then-husband, Jeff Gillooly, just before the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships in Detroit. \n \n Even though Harding wasn\u2019t personally involved in the infamous, injurious leg-whacking, she may as well have been, her reputation and career were so irreparably damaged. She became a punchline, her name alone providing a bitter shorthand for scandal. \n \n Advertisement \n \n All of which makes \u201cI, Tonya\u201d such a wonder. Not only will it make you think about Tonya Harding again, it will make you do so with unexpected sympathy. It will make you feel for her, deeply, for the abuse and pain she\u2019s suffered for so much of her life. Director Craig Gillespie pulls off what would seem to be an impossible high-wire act: He\u2019s made a movie that\u2019s affectionately mocking\u2014of this theatrical sport, of the idiots who surrounded Harding, of this hideous moment in fashion and pop culture\u2014without actually mocking Harding herself. \n \n Steven Rogers\u2019 script shows great kindness and emotional charity for this wounded figure, even as it tells her story through a whirlwind of unreliable narrators. It\u2019s \u201cGoodFellas\u201d on ice\u2014darkly comic and often just plain dark, but always breathtakingly alive. Despite the colorful glitz and cheese of the figure-skating setting, \u201cI, Tonya\u201d has an unmistakably tumultuous air from the very start. And at the center of the storm is Margot Robbie in the performance of a lifetime as Harding. \n \n Robbie has steadily shown keen insight in the roles she\u2019s chosen, a hunger for the challenge of meaty material and a clear drive to prove she\u2019s so much more than just a beautiful face. Whether it\u2019s as the va-va-voomy siren of \u201cThe Wolf of Wall Street\u201d (which put her on the map), the smooth scam artist of \u201cFocus,\u201d the bat-wielding bad-ass Harley Quinn in \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d or the noble frontier woman of \u201cZ for Zachariah,\u201d Robbie has dazzled us with her versatility, even as she\u2019s consistently held us with her charismatic screen presence. Here, she\u2019s got the requisite swagger of an athlete at the top of her sport (and even learned to skate for the part), but it\u2019s tinged with sadness as we the see the low sense of self-worth buried underneath\u2014the result of years of physical and verbal abuse at the hands of her cruel mother. \n \n Allison Janney absolutely tears it up as the profane, chain-smoking LaVona Harding, constantly insulting Tonya and messing with her mind in the name of making her a champion. It\u2019s a showy, scenery-chewing performance but it\u2019s not one-note; Janney brings an undercurrent of sorrow to the part in revealing LaVona\u2019s twisted methodology. \n \n But Tonya was doomed never to receive an enthusiastic embrace from the figure skating elite because she and her mother didn\u2019t fit their superficial, socioeconomic ideals. That\u2019s an element of Harding\u2019s story that \u201cI, Tonya\u201d depicts incisively; it\u2019s one of the key components to her tragic downfall, but it also makes her story relatable beyond the insular world of figure skating. Growing up poor in Portland, Oregon, with her frizzy ponytail and poofy, homemade costumes, Harding struggled to look the part of the pristine ice queen\u2014something Kerrigan achieved effortlessly. Even though Harding was an extraordinarily athletic female skater\u2014one of a rare few to this day to land a triple axel cleanly in competition\u2014U.S. judges often didn\u2019t give her the scores she deserved because she didn\u2019t adhere to the image they wanted to project. \n \n Advertisement \n \n When Harding married the first man who was nice to her\u2014at least, at first\u2014she went from one abusive situation to another because it felt familiar, if nothing else. Sebastian Stan initially plays the part of Jeff Gillooly with a hint of benign goofiness. He\u2019s a sleaze ball in a turtleneck and a porn mustache. But as his violent side emerges and his emotional hold on Tonya strengthens, he\u2019s positively chilling\u2014and your heart breaks for her all over again, because you know that no matter where she goes, she\u2019s trapped. \n \n Under those circumstances, it\u2019s a miracle she could get out on the ice merely to practice, much less compete at the absolute highest echelons of the sport. And the more we learn about her life, the more it becomes sadly clear that the odds were always stacked against her. \n \n In interviews both recreated and imagined, Gillespie depicts her rise and fall from a variety of competing perspectives and contradictory voices. (Editor Tatiana S. Riegel keeps the film moving at a propulsive pace.) We hear from Harding herself; an increasingly abrasive LaVona; Harding\u2019s genteel coach, Diane (Julianne Nicholson); a squirmy Gillooly; and Gillooly\u2019s delusional pal, Shawn Eckhardt (Paul Walter Hauser), Harding\u2019s self-appointed \u201cbodyguard\u201d and the mastermind of what everyone bitterly refers to as \u201cThe Incident.\u201d \n \n Taken together, they create a picture that isn\u2019t exactly the truth, the whole truth and nothing but. What \u201cI, Tonya\u201d does provide honestly, though, is a vivid slice of pop culture history\u2014an irresistible, soapy mix of jealousy, competition and class warfare, fortified by powerful performances and unexpected emotional resonance. \n \n Given the gripping, heightened reality of this stranger-than-fiction tale, it\u2019s frustrating that Gillespie has chosen so many on-the-nose soundtrack selections to punctuate particular moments. \"Devil Woman\" by Cliff Richard starts up as LaVona barks orders on the ice at a young Tonya, played with convincing angst and heartache by Mckenna Grace. Supertramp\u2019s \u201cGoodbye Stranger\u201d plays during a beautifully fluid sequence in which Harding finally finds the guts to leave Gillooly and her volatile life with him behind. Great songs, all, but the classic rock needle drops can be distractingly obvious. \n \n \n \n Still, that\u2019s a minor deduction in an otherwise nearly flawless program. \u201cI, Tonya\u201d is one of the year\u2019s best films. ||||| 'I, Tonya,' You, Implicated \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption 30West 30West \n \n Tonya Harding was never supposed to be a pro figure skater. Like so many young American dreamers before her, she had it all wrong for success: born into the wrong class, raised by the wrong role model, drawn to the wrong men. And she had the wrong kind of femininity for the sport she loved, too, because those judges didn't want to see a ZZ Top routine from someone who sewed her own costume, even if it did include a flawlessly executed triple axel. \n \n So when Harding did find a bit of glory, there were corrective measures in place, and her self-made undoing \u2014 by playing some part in the \"hit\" on U.S. rival Nancy Kerrigan's leg, the scandal that would unravel her career and the entire 1990s along with it \u2014 was the fitting, flaming end to her membership in the elite club that never wanted her anyway. \n \n That is the argument put forth by I, Tonya, the cheeky and skate-sharp new biopic from director Craig Gillespie coming only a few short years after the ESPN documentary. The title tips us off that Harding's story \u2014 drawn from interviews with all the key players \u2014 has been rehabilitated into the stuff of tabloid Greek tragedy. This is a bold film, especially in its leveraging of all that real-life contradiction to create something that shocks and delights us with its own stylistic wrongness. I, Tonya takes greater risks with the biopic genre than any other in recent memory, and it's remarkable how much of it lands upright. It's the triple axel of based-on-a-true-story movies. \n \n As played magnificently by Margot Robbie, Tonya is a powerhouse athlete, a fragile abuse victim, an impoverished country girl and a snarky media critic. Robbie embodies all these roles with a childlike sincerity, a lost-soul cluelessness, as her Tonya never ceases to wonder why it can't just be about the skating. She and the film whip among these personas with wild abandon, mixing styles and tones in a chaotic fashion that borders on overkill. (Must we indulge \"present-day\" interviews, voice-over AND talking directly to the camera?) But it all builds to a satisfying and illuminating portrait of a poor American girl who maybe never stood a chance. \n \n The film's account of Harding's upbringing is so heartbreaking that it would be unbearable if it weren't presented in such a bouncy, off-kilter way. As a child in Oregon, she was practically shoved onto the ice by her waitress mother LaVona (a superb Allison Janney), partially because her mom sees talent but mostly because she is grooming Tonya for a future as the butt of her endless verbal and physical abuse. LaVona will hold the cost of Tonya's skating lessons over her head for the rest of her life, long after she compelled her daughter to drop out of school so she can focus on the sport. \n \n Most of the film is devoted to Tonya's marriage to, and subsequent divorce from, Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan). Although the Jeff in the \"present day\" sequences is muted and introspective, offering deep insights into how his decisions would go on to shape the culture, in the rest of the film, he is an abusive leech, incapable of offering anything to Tonya except psychological obsession as she climbs the ranks of U.S. Figure Skating. Their tumultuous relationship is marked by the cycle of Jeff's abuse (he hits her at home and later threatens her at gunpoint) followed by his blubbering, shameless apologies and Tonya's continued gravitation to him even after leaving him and filing a restraining order. Even these scenes, which are brutal enough to watch without the pop songs that punctuate them like thunderclaps, don't come close to reaching the real-life Harding's accounts of what Gillooly did to her. But abuse is complex, particularly if you live a sheltered, scrutinized existence, and one of the big strengths of I, Tonya is how it refuses to make its hero into a sap or her abusers into mere monsters. If they were, we wouldn't feel as affected by a moving (if a bit showoffy) long take of a post-divorce Jeff in various mopey positions around the house, inhabiting Tonya's negative space. \n \n The film abruptly shifts gears into full-blown farce as we approach what everyone on screen refers to as \"the incident\": the attack that created the inescapable digital-video image of the innocent, white-dressed Kerrigan clutching her knee and wailing, \"Why? Why?\" Gillespie and screenwriter Steven Rogers know an inept hit job when they see one, and they milk this conspiracy of dunces for all it's worth. It's all orchestrated by Jeff's buddy and self-proclaimed Tonya bodyguard Shawn Eckhardt (Paul Hauser, champion goober), who mimes criminal-mastermind behavior from inside his mom's basement; his \"guys\" get hyped for their job by blasting \"Gloria\"; and when it's all over and Shawn has blown his own cover, he insists to a TV reporter that he has training in \"counterespionage and counterterrorism,\" despite all evidence to the contrary. \n \n I, Tonya gets mushy on the question of exactly how much knowledge Tonya had of the incident, which is consistent with the intrigue that has surrounded this sordid saga ever since. But it takes the extra step of insisting the real culprits are us, the basic-cable mouth-droolers who hoovered up her every mistake because we love to watch train wrecks on ice. In fact, Tonya shames us right to our faces, an accusation we might take more seriously if the movie didn't seem to be trying so hard to reconnect with whatever electric qualities first hooked America on her story. Still, for as jolting an experience as watching the film can be, it does help Tonya live her truth, while revealing, from within all its wrongs, the basic truth of figure skating: It has never just been about the skating. ||||| (CNN) \"I, Tonya\" announces up front that it's based on \"irony free, wildly contradictory\" interviews with the participants, yielding a darkly satiric comedy with the tenor of a Coen brothers movie. Elevated by Margot Robbie and Allison Janney's shimmering performances, this entertaining account of those strange events earns the sort of high marks for creative interpretation that its protagonist complained eluded her. \n \n That protagonist, of course, is Tonya Harding, the figure skater etched into the public consciousness by her association with one of the strangest modern scandals -- namely, her husband Jeff Gillooly (Sebastian Stan) participating in a plot to kneecap her principal rival, Nancy Kerrigan, prior to the 1994 Olympics. \n \n The movie, however -- directed by Craig Gillespie (\"Lars and the Real Girl\"), and drawn by screenwriter Steven Rogers in part from his interviews with Harding and Gillooly -- goes well beyond \"The Incident,\" as its principals call it, to focus on Harding's abusive, hardscrabble upbringing, segueing from life with her abusive mother LaVona (Janney) to her abusive boyfriend-then-husband Gillooly. \n \n Featuring the characters in direct-to-camera interviews, a strong undercurrent to the film is that Harding's downfall preceded several others of the tabloid-friendly 1990s, so much so that a \"Hard Copy\" reporter (played by Bobby Cannavale) is among the witnesses, wryly noting that the show was dismissed as trash by a media ecosystem that later mastered copying its sordid bag of tricks. \n \n Janney pretty nearly steals the show as Tonya's foul-mouthed, chain-smoking mother, who constantly gripes about how she's squandering her limited resources on skating lessons and coaching for a girl, she's told, who \"stands out because she looks like she chops wood every morning.\" \n \n Read More",

But he argues \"the sleight of hand used to realize the skating sequences is visually distracting in places.\" He also says Robbie \"struggles\" at the start to truly come across as just 15. And though she recovers to deliver \"a layered and unexpectedly sympathetic portrait,\" Allison Janney, playing Harding's mother, \"pretty nearly steals the show.\" Christy Lemire is effusive: Robbie gives \"the performance of a lifetime,\" conveying \"the requisite swagger of an athlete at the top of her sport\" as well as the \"low sense of self-worth buried underneath.\" As for the film itself, it highlights Harding's outsider status from the outset, which \"makes her story relatable beyond the insular world of figure skating,\" Lemire writes at RogerEbert.com. She concludes by calling I, Tonya a \"nearly flawless program\" and \"one of the year's best films.\"",

Every day, she's like, shedding away. ... Overnight, it's a whole different person that you're looking at,\" Martha Hughes, Castanada's aunt, told CNN affiliate KABC. \n \n Doctors diagnosed Castanada with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, a rare disease that can be triggered by antibiotics or other medications. \n \n \"When she took the medication, she started having a hard time breathing, and she told her mom that her lips were burning, her throat, her eyes, they got so red that she couldn't talk. So she rushed her to the ER, and that's when they diagnosed her with the disease. And from there it has just spiraled to a nightmare,\" Hughes said. \n \n Now Castanada, the mother of a 4-month-old, is in critical condition at the University of California, Irvine, burn center. \n \n Her prognosis is good, even though the disease has a high mortality rate, according to Dr. Victor Joe, the center's director. \n \n But the situation, Castanada's family says, has been devastating. \n \n \"Just unreal, just watching your daughter burn in front of you, literally, burn in front of you,\" her mother, Laura Corona, told KABC. \"Every day, a new blister, a new burn, a new scar. And she's just, 'Mommy, I want to go home.' And I can't take her home. I can't put water on her lips.\" \n \n Mom: 'Don't share medication' \n \n On a website created to raise funds for Castanada's care, her mother said the harrowing ordeal began soon after her daughter took the medicine. \n \n \"A friend offered her an antibiotic pill that she had from a previous illness,\" Corona wrote. \"She was thinking that it would help her. This would be the biggest mistake of her life.\" \n \n Now, Corona says she's hoping to spread the word so others don't make the same mistake. \n \n \"Don't share medication. Don't give someone else your medication. Don't offer medication,\" she said. \n \n She also advises parents to find out what their children are allergic to -- before it's too late. \n \n Doctor: Reaction causing skin to separate \n \n At first, doctors diagnosed Castanada with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, which refers to a condition where between 10% and 30% of the skin on the body is affected, Joe said. Now she's experiencing Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, the diagnosis when more than 30% of the body is affected. Joe estimates that 65% of Castaneda's skin and mucus membranes have been affected. \n \n The allergic reaction is causing layers of Castaneda's skin to separate, Joe said, creating lesions that grow into large open wounds. \n \n \"Patients can experience problems with taste, swallowing, eyesight and sexual functions can be affected. In Yaasmeen's case, we are particularly concerned because her eyes have been affected. This can cause scarring of the corneas, which could lead to permanent blindness,\" he said. \"We are trying to prevent that from happening.\" \n \n Photos on the fundraising website show Castanada lying in a hospital bed, with openings for her eyes cut from the bandages that cover her. \n \n As part of her treatment for the disease, doctors have wrapped her body in a special dressing, Joe said. \n \n \"We have chosen to place a dressing that adheres to the open wound, which allows her skin to heal without having to remove the bandages to wash the wounds,\" he said. \n \n Mortality for those suffering from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis can be as high as 25% in adults, but tends to be lower with early treatment, according to the Merck Manual. \n \n Though it's uncommon, Joe said his hospital has treated around six cases in the past year, because the burn center has experience treating open wounds. \n \n \"This is very sobering. The fact that you can get a life-threatening situation from taking a medication. It can happen, and most people don't think twice about taking pills for things,\" Joe said. \"In fact, most of the time you do have some sort of side reaction to medication, just not this severe.\" \n \n After recovering from Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, patients usually only have minor issues with their skin, such as dryness, Joe said. \n \n \"Hopefully new skin will come in,\" Corona told KABC. \"I'm just there watching. All I can tell her is, \"Hang on, hang on. It's almost over.'\" ||||| \n \n This is Yassmeen Castanada's story ... .. \n \n \n \n On Thanksgiving Yaasmeen was feeling ill. Common cold, sore throat. A friend offered her an antibiotic pill that her friend had from a previous illness. She was thinking that it would help her, but this would be the biggest mistake of her life. After taking the pill , Yaasmeen started experiencing burning in her throat, eyes and mouth. As the night went by, her eyes became blood shot red and the lining of her lips was already torn off. I rushed her to the ER . The dr's immediately diagnosed her with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome. Something I've never heard about. Immediately I googled Stevens Johnson's and I began to panic. In my mind I knew this couldn't happen to my baby, but deep down in the pit of my stomach was a terrible, terrible feeling. Within 4 days Yaasmeen's appearance was transformed. I watched my daughter's skin burn, blister, bubble, n peel off and there was nothing I could do about it. The pain and agony she was going through just tore my heart to pieces. She was transferred to UCIrvine's burn unit. On December 5th she has surgery to scrape the top portion of her body. She was wrapped in biobrane. 2days later the bottom portion of her body was scraped. As you can see in the photo, she was wrapped in bandages from hed to toe. My daughter was intubated so she couldn't communicate with me. i made sure i prayed over her daily, I spoke to her daily and reminded her that she had a daughter that loved her very much. Everyday i told her to fight for her life. Yaasmeens blood was infected and she has had 5 blood trasfusions. As we got closer to recovery, she had a set back. She was having a hard time breathing. After multiple exams of her trachea, they noticed her airway was closing so she had an emergency tracheotomy. she had her trach for 6months. There have been times where she had trouble breathing. She had another surgery in april to open her airway because it closed and the steriod injections didn't work. On my birthday June 18th she had surgery to reconstruct her trachea. She was able to sing happy birthday to me as soon as the anesthesia wore off. Best gift ever! Today 6/25 Yaasmeen had her stitches removed. Yay! Her left eye is very damaged, she will need a cornea transplant. Hopefully in 6-8 months when she is healthier we can face that surgery. As for now, she will just work on getting healthier and spending a lot of time with her daughter Khloe and return to CSULA! This whole expierence has taught me to never take my children for granted. I almost lost my daughter to 1 pill! She never smoke or drank, she is a good kid that was on the right path. I just can't understand why this happened the way it did. But we will not dwell in the past, She has goals and a bright future ahead of her. I thank all of you for your love, support and prayers for my daughter. *Please be careful with medications because an allergic reaction can happen to anyone. #prayforyaas \n \n Help spread the word!

It's usually a reaction to a medication or an infection. Often, Stevens-Johnson syndrome begins with flu-like symptoms, followed by a painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters. Then the top layer of the affected skin dies and sheds. \n \n Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a medical emergency that usually requires hospitalization. Treatment focuses on eliminating the underlying cause, controlling symptoms and minimizing complications. \n \n Recovery after Stevens-Johnson syndrome can take weeks to months, depending on the severity of your condition. If it was caused by a medication, you'll need to permanently avoid that drug and others closely related to it. \n \n \n \n",

She rapidly \"started having a hard time breathing, and she told her mom that her lips were burning, her throat, her eyes, they got so red that she couldn't talk,\" says her aunt. Within 24 hours she was hooked up to a ventilator; she's now at the University of California, Irvine, burn center. Her initial diagnosis was known as Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, an allergic reaction that caused her skin's layers to part, resulting in open wounds. \"It can be considered a burn from the inside out,\" a dermatologist tells ABC7. But as burn center director Dr. Victor Joe tells CNN, that disease refers to a condition that affects up to a third of the skin; roughly two-thirds of Castanada's skin is affected, and her condition is now called Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis. Though the mortality rate for the diseases can reach as high as 25%, Joe believes she will survive. But he says \"we are particularly concerned because her eyes have been affected. This can cause scarring of the corneas, which could lead to permanent blindness.\" Per a GoFundMe page set up by her family, Castanada has had surgeries since Friday on the top and bottom portions of her body in which skin was scraped to spur new growth.

(Alan Diaz, Associated Press / ) \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 Doctors, nurses and social workers from across the country, 107 in all, were charged in what federal officials in Washington called a \"nationwide takedown\" of medical professionals accused of fraudulently billing Medicare out of nearly half a billion dollars. \n \n The amount of bogus Medicare claims, totaling about $452 million, was the highest in a single raid in the history of a federal strike force combating rising fraud in the medical industry, according to the Justice Department. Arrests were made in seven major cities. \n \n The Obama administration said it was toughening its attack on those who filed bills for ambulance rides never taken and medical procedures never provided. \n \n In addition, officials in the Health and Human Services Department suspended or took other administrative actions against 52 medical providers after analyzing billing requests and finding additional \"credible allegations of fraud.\" \n \n In the Los Angeles area, eight people, including two doctors, were charged with fraudulently billing about $20 million for services never provided. \n \n Bolademi Adetola, owner of healthcare equipment provider Latay Medical Services in Gardena, was charged with billing Medicare for power wheelchairs that were never purchased. Greatcare Home Health in Los Angeles allegedly paid kickbacks to recruiters to find \"patients\" who were perfectly fine, and then have doctors knowingly write phony prescriptions for them. \n \n Dr. Augustus Ohemeng and Dr. George Tarryk, who treated patients at the Pacific Clinic in Long Beach, were among four individuals who allegedly falsely billed for feeding tubes for patients who did not need them. \n \n None of the defendants or their lawyers could be reached for comment. \n \n Assistant Atty. Gen. Lanny Breuer, head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said the arrests, fourth in a series of Medicare fraud takedowns over the last two years, served as another warning to future scammers. \n \n \"Medicare is an attractive target for criminals,\" Breuer said, even as prosecution and jail time is risked with every false claim. \n \n \"If you don't believe it,\" he said, \"ask Lawrence Duran, the former owner of a mental healthcare company in Miami who was sentenced last year to 50 years in prison. Or his two co-owners, each of whom was sentenced to 35 years.\" \n \n Of the 107 defendants in the latest crackdown, 87 were arrested Wednesday. Federal agents were either still looking for the others or expecting them to surrender voluntarily. \n \n The other cities were Miami; Tampa, Fla.; Houston; Baton Rouge, La.; Detroit and Chicago. \n \n The Obama administration has stepped up efforts to combat fraud in the Medicare program, which provides health coverage to about 50 million elderly and disabled Americans. \n \n Last year the federal government charged 1,430 people with healthcare fraud, up from 797 in 2008, according to the Health and Human Services Department. The agency also reported revoking the eligibility of more than 60,000 Medicare and Medicaid providers and suppliers and recovering $4.1 billion in fraudulent claims. \n \n Although there is broad agreement that fraud is widespread in Medicare and Medicaid, estimates of the scope of the program vary from $20 billion a year to $100 billion. Total spending on Medicare and Medicaid is expected to reach about $1 trillion this year. \n \n Louis Saccoccio, chief executive of the National Health Care Anti-Fraud Assn., said the latest round of arrests was encouraging and reflected the intensified efforts by the government to combat fraud, especially since 2009. \n \n He said he was most pleased to see that the Health and Human Services Department had stopped payments to 52 providers by using new tools to analyze data and detect potentially fraudulent charges. \n \n The system, which was set up by the healthcare law President Obama signed two years ago, relies on a computer program to identify patterns of potentially fraudulent charges by providers. \"That really has the promise to be a game changer,\" he said. \"In the future, what you will see is the real impact is going to come from preventing fraud.\" \n \n richard.serrano@latimes.com \n \n Times staff writer Noam N. Levey contributed to this report. ||||| * Sebelius uses arrests to defend Obama healthcare law \n \n * FBI investigating more than 2,600 healthcare fraud cases \n \n By Jeremy Pelofsky \n \n WASHINGTON, May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. authorities have charged 107 people, including doctors and nurses, for trying to defraud the federal Medicare healthcare program for the elderly and disabled of about $452 million, the biggest Medicare fraud sweep to date, the Obama administration said on Wednesday. \n \n At least 91 people were arrested in Miami; Houston; Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and four other cities on a variety of charges: from submitting false billing for home healthcare, mental health services, HIV infusions and physical therapy to money laundering and receiving kickbacks. \n \n Justice Department and Health and Human Services Department officials were unable to say how much Medicare actually paid out, but a review of 34 complaints and indictments found that authorities were seeking to recover at least $59.5 million of allegedly ill-gotten gains. \n \n \"These fraud schemes were committed by people up and down the chain of healthcare providers - from doctors, nurses, and licensed clinical social workers, to office managers and patient recruiters,\" said Lanny Breuer, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's criminal division. \n \n President Barack Obama's administration has been pushing to squeeze out fraud from federal programs like Medicare as part of a broader attempt to stem soaring healthcare costs, arguing fraud can contribute to rising prices for services. \n \n Breuer said that it is the single largest Medicare billing fraud sweep by the Justice Department's special task force in its five-year history. In September, the Obama administration charged 91 people in connection with a variety of schemes aimed at bilking Medicare out of $295 million. \n \n The FBI said it is investigating more than 2,600 cases of healthcare fraud with more than 500 agents and analysts. Since March 2007, the Justice Department said, it has charged more than 1,300 people for falsely billing Medicare more than $4 billion. \n \n Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius sought to use the arrests to defend Obama's controversial healthcare law passed in 2010, arguing that additional resources provided under the law helped authorities root out fraud. \n \n \"Today's actions are another example of how the Affordable Care Act is helping the Obama administration fight fraud and strengthen the Medicare program,\" Sebelius said. \n \n Republicans and 26 out of the 50 U.S. states have challenged the law and are seeking to have it invalidated as unconstitutional because it would require Americans to have health insurance coverage or pay a penalty. \n \n SEVEN ARRESTED IN BATON ROUGE \n \n The biggest cases were in Baton Rouge where seven people were arrested and charged with eight counts, including conspiracy and healthcare fraud for billing Medicare for some $225.6 million in unnecessary services and in some cases not providing services billed. \n \n They ran and worked at two community mental health centers in Louisiana where they billed for more group therapy sessions than were provided, including recreational and education psychotherapy, according to court records. \n \n Medicare paid out more than $37.9 million for the services to the two centers in Baton Rouge, identified as Shifa Community Mental Health Center and Serenity Center, according to the records. \n \n U.S. prosecutors sought to have two of the owners of the centers, Hoor Naz Jafri and Roslyn Dogan, held without bond pending trial. Dogan was also accused of stealing evidence from the prosecutors' office in a bid to obstruct the investigation, according to a detention memo. \n \n Four others who worked as therapists at the centers pleaded guilty last month to one count of conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud for purporting to provide group therapy and document patients' attendance, the court documents said. \n \n In one case out of Miami, 10 people were charged with allegedly seeking $63 million in reimbursements from Medicare as some therapists altered their paperwork to try to justify services for patients who did not need them. \n \n In another Florida case, one person was accused of receiving kickbacks to refer patients to a company that offered home health and physical therapy services, submitting $60 million in claims. Medicare reimbursed that group, NANY Home Health Inc, $40 million. \n \n Last month, the three operators of NANY Home Health were sentenced to lengthy prison terms for their roles in the scheme and were ordered to pay $40 million in restitution.",

Kony, whose forces have spent years attacking central African villages, mutilating civilians and stealing children, has been indicted by the International Criminal Court. \n \n President Obama has ordered a sharp increase in U.S. Special Operations forces deployed to Uganda and sent U.S. military aircraft there for the first time in the ongoing effort to hunt down warlord Joseph Kony across a broad swath of central Africa. \n \n The CV-22 Osprey aircraft will arrive in Uganda by midweek, along with refueling aircraft and about 150 Air Force Special Operations forces and other airmen to fly and maintain the planes, according to Amanda Dory, deputy assistant secretary of defense for African affairs. At least four Ospreys will be deployed. \n \n The White House began to notify Congress, under the War Powers Act, of the new deployments as they began Sunday night. Dory and other officials emphasized that the Ospreys will be used for troop transport and that the rules of engagement for U.S. forces remain the same as for about 100 Special Operations troops that Obama first sent to help find Kony in October 2011. \n \n U.S. personnel are authorized to \u201cprovide information, advice and assistance\u201d to an African Union military task force tracking Kony and his organization, the Lord\u2019s Resistance Army (LRA), across Uganda, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Congo. While combat-equipped, they are prohibited from engaging LRA forces unless in self-defense. \n \n The new War Powers Act notification sets the approximate total for all U.S. forces in Uganda at 300. \n \n View Graphic A map of the Lord's Resistance Army area of influence \n \n Kony, whose forces have spent years attacking central African villages, mutilating civilians and stealing children, has been indicted by the International Criminal Court. His organization is thought to have been decimated in recent years through military action against it and defections. \n \n LRA attacks have decreased significantly and the number of people killed has dropped more than 75 percent since 2010, said Grant Harris, a special assistant to Obama and senior African affairs director for the National Security Council. Three of the organization\u2019s five commanders have been \u201cremoved . . . from the battlefield\u201d since May 2012, he said, including \u201ccredible reporting\u201d that second-in-command Okot Odhiambo was killed late last year. \n \n Force shifts its location \n \n But Kony has not been definitively sighted for some time. His force is now thought to number no more than 250 fighters who shift position frequently within a wide area across the target countries. Most recently, he has been thought to be somewhere in the heavy jungle of the eastern Central African Republic, a country in the midst of political upheaval and virtually without a government. \n \n U.S. and A.U. forces pursuing Kony operate out of bases in Uganda. Administration officials who described the new deployments insisted they did not imply any weakening in the Obama administration\u2019s criticism of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni for signing a new law imposing harsh penalties for \u201chomosexual offenses.\u201d \n \n Obama warned that the law, passed last month by the Ugandan parliament, was a \u201cstep backward for all Ugandans,\u201d and the administration said it would review bilateral relations, including $400 million in annual U.S. aid to Uganda. \n \n \u201cEnsuring justice and accountability for human rights violators like the LRA and protecting\u201d the rights of gay and transgendered persons \u201care not mutually exclusive,\u201d Harris said. \n \n He said the administration has already moved to shift funding away from partners \u201cwhose actions don\u2019t reflect\u201d U.S. values, including $6.4 million that had been designated for the Interreligious Council of Uganda, which has supported the legislation. \n \n A planned survey of key populations at risk for HIV, to be jointly conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Uganda University, has also been suspended because \u201cwe think proceeding could cause danger to staff and respondents,\u201d Harris said. \n \n He said that approximately $3 million in tourism and biodiversity promotion programs has been transferred from the Ugandan government to nongovernmental organizations. The Pentagon has also shifted regional military conferences that were to be held in Uganda to other locations. \n \n \u201cWe are continuing to look at additional steps we might take,\u201d Harris said, and \u201ccontinue to urge Uganda to repeal the law.\u201d \n \n Quick transport of troops \n \n Dory, at the Pentagon, declined to specify the exact number of Ospreys that are being sent to Uganda or where they would be based inside the country. \n \n The Pentagon, the State Department and A.U. task force commanders requested the aircraft last year to better enable the quick transport of troops to areas where they have received intelligence about Kony. \n \n Ospreys are tilt-rotor aircraft capable of landing and lifting straight off the ground like helicopters, but they can also fly and land as fixed-wing planes. They are faster, and with their refueling capability, they can fly farther than the small, fixed-wing contract aircraft being used in the mission. \n \n Each can carry about 24 troops, and the aircraft are equipped with .50-caliber machine guns for self-defense. \u201cThey will make a significant difference in the ability to respond to leads\u201d about Kony\u2019s whereabouts, many of them generated through growing defections from Kony\u2019s ranks, Dory said. \n \n The deployment is also \u201can excellent example of being able to share assets between different combatant commands,\u201d she said. Normally based in Djibouti, on the Horn of Africa, under the U.S. Central Command \u2014 which oversees the Middle East \u2014 the Ospreys are temporarily being transferred to the Africa Command. The deployment is temporary, officials said, but they provided no estimate of how long they will remain in Uganda. \n \n The LRA poses no threat to the United States, but the administration sees assistance to the A.U. mission as a useful way to build military and political partnerships with African governments in a region where al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations are rapidly expanding, as well as to demonstrate adherence to human rights principles. \n \n Although critics accuse Obama of \u201cweakness\u201d in Syria and the administration has been challenged by Russia\u2019s military intervention in Ukraine, the Uganda action is a relatively inexpensive way to show resolve in a popular cause. \n \n LRA atrocities publicized on the Internet sparked interest among tens of thousands of young people in the United States, many of whom wrote their members of Congress. In 2009, Congress passed legislation expressing \u201csupport for increased, comprehensive U.S. efforts to help mitigate and eliminate the threat posed by the LRA to civilians and regional stability.\u201d ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Joseph Kony is wanted on war crimes charges \n \n The US has announced it is sending military aircraft and more special forces to look for Ugandan rebel leader Joseph Kony. \n \n At least four CV-22 Ospreys and refuelling planes, as well as 150 Air Force special forces personnel will arrive in Uganda this week, they say. \n \n Mr Kony is wanted by the International Criminal Court on war crimes charges. \n \n The US first deployed some 100 special forces in 2011 to help thousands of African troops track him down. \n \n His Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebels are notorious for abducting children and forcing the boys to become fighters and keeping the girls as sex slaves. \n \n Boys are forced to kill their own parents, so they think they cannot return home. \n \n The group first emerged in Uganda in the 1980s but its fighters now roam between Central African Republic, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \n \n National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said the lack of aircraft had been identified by the African countries leading the hunt for Mr Kony as one of their major obstacles to finding him and the other LRA leaders \"across a wide swath of one of the world's poorest, least governed and most remote regions\". \n \n The US forces would be based in Uganda but would be used in other countries where the LRA was present, she said. \n \n The African Union-led forces would remain in charge of the operation, with the US retaining an advisory role. \n \n CV-22 Ospreys can land and take off vertically like a helicopter but fly like a plane so they can travel further and faster than helicopters. \n \n The US has offered up to $5m (\u00a33.3m) for leads resulting in his arrest.",

(AP) \u2014 While his mother was preparing food in the kitchen, a 5-year-old Florida boy called 911 to invite law enforcement officers over for Thanksgiving dinner. \n \n Monica Webster of the Walton County Sheriff's Office tells the News Herald (http://bit.ly/2gs8nkH ) that with all the bad calls they receive every day, this was a happy call. But young Billy Nolin's family had no idea he'd invited guests to dinner. \n \n Mom Landi McCormick says she was cooking when Billy's grandfather noticed him talking to someone on an old cellphone.

The deputies gave Billy a sheriff's badge. \n \n ___ \n \n Information from: The (Panama City, Fla.) News Herald, http://www.newsherald.com ||||| DeFUNIAK SPRINGS \u2014 The 911 call on Thursday was short and sweet. \n \n \u201cWill you come over cause we\u2019re eating Thanksgiving,\u201d the young voice with the distinct southern accent inquired. \u201cThank you. Bye.\u201d \n \n The caller hung up the phone immediately, leaving the Walton County 911 dispatcher puzzled, but happy. \n \n \u201cWith all the bad calls we take on a daily basis, this one was a welcomed happy call that made all of us smile,\u201d said Walton County Sheriff\u2019s Office Lead Communications Officer Monica Webster. \n \n The caller was 5-year-old Billy Nolin. And he'd extended the invitation to his family's feast without anyone in his house knowing. \n \n His mom, Landi McCormick, was in the kitchen preparing Thanksgiving dinner with her mom while Billy was outside with his grandfather and his little brother, 4-year-old Camden. Billy was playing with an old cell phone when his grandfather noticed that he was talking to someone. \n \n \u201cI came out and asked him what he was doing,\u201d McCormick recalled. \n \n Billy looked at his mother rather sheepishly and admitted that he had dialed 911. \n \n \u201cI asked him, \u2018Why did you do that? You know that you are only supposed to do that if there\u2019s an emergency,\u2019 \u201d McCormick said. \u201cHe started crying, and just a few minutes later Deputy (Dannon) Byrd from the Sheriff\u2019s Office drove up.\u201d \n \n The deputy walked up to McCormick and asked if Billy was the young man who had called 911. Rather than scold the little boy, Byrd knelt down and thanked Billy for his kind invitation. \n \n \u201cHe told us that Billy had made his day,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cBut then he reminded him that we should only use 911 for emergencies.\u201d \n \n As an added treat, Byrd and his partner, Deputy Aaron Ethridge, gave the boy a sheriff\u2019s badge and allowed him to sit in their patrol car and activate the lights and siren. \n \n \u201cThey asked him what he wanted to be when he grew up,\u201d McCormick said. \u201cHe said, \u2018I want to be a cop, so I can be nice to little kids like you are some day.\u2019 \u201d \n \n Billy said he first became aware of the Walton County Sheriff's Office when deputies visited his school, Maude Saunders Elementary, for Dads and Donuts Day. \n \n \"I wanted them to have cheesecake with us,\" Billy said, explaining why he invited the deputies for dinner. \"It's my favorite, so I wanted them to have some, too.\" \n \n WSCO Public Information Officer Corey Dobridnia posted some photos from the visit on the Sheriff\u2019s Office Facebook page, and the post quickly went viral. Folks from all over the country praised the deputies and Billy for their kindness. \n \n \u201cThis is typical of the kind of professionalism our deputies display every day,\u201d Dobridnia said. \u201cIt just goes to show that deputies aren\u2019t just about arresting people and putting them in jail. \n \n \"Billy\u2019s call brightened all of our days, and the deputies\u2019 visit gave Billy a Thanksgiving memory that will stay with him for the rest of his life.\u201d",

    "document": "Mississippi, Alabama and other Southern states are among the most highly religious states in the nation, while New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine in New England are among the least devout, according to some of the key measures used to determine levels of religiosity in the Pew Research Center\u2019s most recent Religious Landscape Study. \n \n To begin, select a state to see where it ranks in terms of overall religiosity. In exploring the interactive it is important to keep in mind that differences between two states may not always be statistically significant due to the margins of error that are inherent in this survey data. \n \n There are many potential ways of defining what it means to be religious, but for the purposes of this analysis, we looked at four common measures of religious observance: worship attendance, prayer frequency, belief in God and the self-described importance of religion in one\u2019s life. The interactive tool above allows you to rank the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia by each of these measures \u2013 and by the percentage of adults in each state who are \u201chighly religious\u201d overall. \n \n What does it mean to be \u201chighly religious\u201d? In our analysis, this includes any adult who reports at least two of four highly observant behaviors \u2013 attending religious services at least weekly, praying at least daily, believing in God with absolute certainty and saying that religion is very important to them \u2014 while not reporting a low level of religious observance in any of these areas, such as seldom or never attending religious services, seldom or never praying, not believing in God and saying that religion is \u201cnot too\u201d or \u201cnot at all\u201d important in their life. We also define a person as \u201chighly religious\u201d if they report three highly religious behaviors and a low level of religiosity on a fourth measure. \n \n In Alabama and Mississippi, 77% of residents are highly religious by this definition. In both states, for instance, 82% believe in God with absolute certainty. In addition, three-quarters of Mississippians say they pray at least once a day and 77% of Alabama residents say religion is very important in their lives. \n \n Meanwhile, only about a third of people in New Hampshire (33%), Massachusetts (33%), Vermont (34%) and Maine (34%) qualify as highly religious by these criteria. Roughly one-in-five residents of these states report attending religious services at least weekly, and roughly half or fewer say they are certain of God\u2019s existence. \n \n Topics: Religion and Society, Religious Affiliation, Religious Beliefs and Practices ||||| Across America, states and regions differ in terms of their cultures, foods and accents. But one of the biggest distinguishing features is how religion impacts the people of each place. \n \n While religion is widespread across the country, the share of adults for whom religion is extremely important to their lives varies greatly between states. In the most religious state, 77% of the population are highly religious compared with 33% in the least religious. \n \n Christianity is by far the most common religion in the United States, with 70% of Americans identifying as Christian. To break it down further, 25% or Americans are evangelical, 21% are Catholic, 15% are mainline Protestant, and 6% are Protestant. States that are more evangelical tend to be more deeply religious overall. \n \n Despite the high levels of Christianity, the fastest-growing religious affiliation is actually no religion at all. The percentage of adults who are religiously unaffiliated adults grew in every state except for one, and it was the fastest growing ideology in almost every state for which there was data. \n \n 24/7 Wall St. reviewed a 2014 Pew Research Center survey of all 50 states and their religious makeup. Using data from Pew, 24/7 Wall St. ranked states based on how highly religious their populations are. The study also determined the importance of religion residents\u2019 lives, worship attendance, frequency of prayer, and the belief in God. \n \n To identify the most and least religious states, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed a 2014 Pew Research Center survey of all 50 states and their religious makeup.

Trends were determined by comparing the percentage of adherents to the religion in a previous survey conducted in 2007.

    "document": "\"To the world, Chernobyl and Fukushima seem like dangerous places, but for the people who live there, that danger is simply a fact of life,\" says photojournalist Michael Forster Rothbart, who spent two years cataloging the lives of people living in the shadow of nuclear accidents. These images are the result. \n \n \"Most photojournalists distort Chernobyl. They visit briefly, expecting danger and despair, and come away with photos of deformed children and abandoned buildings,\" Forster Rothbart says in his new book, Would You Stay? \"This sensationalist approach obscures more complex stories about how displaced communities adapt and survive.\" \n \n Forster Rothbart's book is about the relative normalcy of people's lives near Chernobyl and Fukushima. But he does find a lot of danger and despair, of course. Would You Stay? is full of people living with cancer. The towns around Chernobyl are depressed, and lacking opportunity. Young people leave if they get the chance. Many of the residents are older, with more invested in the area. In Fukushima, where the disaster happened more recently, people are living in a state of limbo, not knowing when, or if, they might be able to return to their homes. \n \n Authorities ringed Chernobyl with four zones following the 1986 nuclear disaster. Nearest the site is the Exclusion Zone, where people are not supposed to live at all (though about 400 \"self-settlers\" do, and there's all kinds of \"smuggling, research, farming, tourism, poaching\" going on, Forster Rothbart says). Then come three further zones where \"evacuation was merely encouraged, not mandatory.\" They contain 2,293 villages with about 1.6 million inhabitants. \n \n Up to 3,800 people still work at the Chernobyl plant, \"not doing very much.\" The site, which had three other reactors, stopped producing electricity in 2000. But workers have to stay while decommissioning is completed\u2014a process that could take years due to chronic under-funding. \n \n Forster Rothbart has seen the effects of environmental damage in Bhopal, India, Azerbaijan, and the Canadian Arctic. What separates Chernobyl and Fukushima, he says, is the insidiousness of the contamination. Nobody quite knows how it will affect them: \n \n \"When your home gets washed away, the damage you see is immediate and obvious,\" he says. \"When you are hit by radiation, the consequences are never so clear. It\u2019s all a game of probabilities. How much? How dangerous? How soon will it affect me?\" \n \n The people living around Chernobyl are still unsure about the risks 27 years after the fact. And now the same thing is happening Fukushima, though residents have access to daily radiation reports: \n \n Says Forster Rothbart: \"What I saw in Fukushima is that many evacuees are living in a state of limbo, still staying in temporary housing, waiting to learn if they\u2019ll be able to return home, waiting for more answers that never seem to come.\" ||||| SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email \n \n Photographer: Sean Gallup/Getty Images Photographer: Sean Gallup/Getty Images \n \n Ukraine\u2019s looking toward the sun to put a radioactive wasteland back into business. \n \n Thirty years after atomic fallout from the Chernobyl meltdown rendered an area the size of Luxembourg uninhabitable for centuries, Ukraine is seeking investors to develop solar power near the defunct Soviet reactors. \n \n Sunshine is one of the only things that can be harvested from Chernobyl\u2019s 1,000 square mile exclusion zone, where long-lasting radiation makes farming and forestry too dangerous. Save for the guards and workers who maintain the roadblocks and barriers, the area about 100 kilometers (62 miles) north of Kiev remains devoid of productive activities. \n \n \u201cThe Chernobyl site has really good potential for renewable energy,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s environment minister Ostap Semerak, 44, said at an interview in London. \u201cWe already have high-voltage transmission lines that were previously used for the nuclear stations, the land is very cheap and we have many people trained to work at power plants.\u201d \n \n The move to solar at Chernobyl may also help Ukraine move closer toward the European Union and influence public opinion in conflict zones along the Russian border. \n \n \u201cWe have normal European priorities, which means having the best standards with the environment and clean energy ambitions,\u201d said Semerak. \u201cWe want to be a successful Ukraine, to show people in the conflict zone that life is better and more comfortable with us.\u201d \n \n Ukraine\u2019s government remains in an uneasy cease-fire with Kremlin-backed rebels in the eastern region of Donbass along the Russian border. Both sides have struggled to implement obligations outlined under the Minsk Accords and international monitors still report outbreaks of violence, which has left thousands dead and displaced from their homes. \n \n Until recently, Ukraine was heavily dependent on natural gas imported from Russia. The government has been weaning itself from over-reliance following consecutive winters when Russia threatened to withhold supplies because of payment disputes. Last year Ukraine more than halved consumption from its eastern neighbor, according to Ukrtransgaz PJSC. \n \n With solar resources better than Germany\u2019s, which has almost 39 gigawatts of panels installed, Ukraine is increasing its focus on renewables. The government\u2019s initial 1 gigawatt solar target could cost about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion). \n \n Source: Solargis \n \n The environmental ministry has received expressions of interest for its Chernobyl solar complex from two U.S. investment firms and four Canadian energy companies, Semerak said. Ukrainian developers plan to install 4 megawatts of panels on the site by year-end. \n \n The European Bank for Reconstruction & Development is also considering financing, though the talks are at early stages. \n \n \u201cWe can consider such projects like all other renewable projects subject to there being credible and viable investment proposals and all other environmental issues and risks can be addressed to our satisfaction,\u201d said Sevki Acuner, the EBRD\u2019s director for Ukraine. \n \n If the project takes off, it may evolve into a bigger initiative that leverages the transmission lines with 4 gigawatts capacity that are already onsite -- a legacy of the nuclear plant. \n \n Watch Next: Capturing Iceland's Winds ||||| Before the fire, the vomiting, the deaths and the vanishing home, it was the promise of bumper cars that captured the imagination of the boys. \n \n It will be 30 years ago Tuesday that Pripyat and the nearby Chernobyl nuclear plant became synonymous with nuclear disaster, that the word Chernobyl came to mean more than just a little village in rural Ukraine, and this place became more than just another spot in the shadowy Soviet Union. \n \n Even 30 years later \u2013 25 years after the country that built it ceased to exist \u2013 the full damage of that day is still argued. \n \n Death toll estimates run from hundreds to millions. The area near the reactor is both a teeming wildlife refuge and an irradiated ghost-scape. Much of eastern and central Europe continues to deal with fallout aftermath. The infamous Reactor Number 4 remains a problem that is neither solved nor solvable. \n \n But on the night before their world changed, nothing seemed more important to the boys than shiny blue and yellow cars, with actual steering wheels, almost ready for a 10-year-old to drive. \n \n They knew they would have to wait till May 1, 1986, for the bumper cars to be turned on \u2013 a seemingly impossible-to-live-through week away. So Alexandr Sirota and his friends couldn\u2019t resist sneaking into the new park after dark, beneath the deep shadows of the yet-unblinking new Ferris wheel, and under the inky dark of what would soon be the electrified roof over the bumper cars. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019d sit in the cars and make car noises,\u201d recalls Sirota, who\u2019s now 40. \u201cIt was everything we could imagine wanting in life at that time. As young boys, our lives seemed perfect.\u201d \n \n It wasn\u2019t just the new bumper cars, or the new amusement park. Their hometown, Pripyat, had been swampland 30 years before. Now it was a city built to serve the future. And the driver of that future was visible southeast of town, the four massive reactors of the Lenin Nuclear Power Plant, which in common parlance was called Chernobyl, for a village some 9 miles distant. \n \n As the boys sat in the bumper cars, dreaming of the future, they knew what had to happen next. An adult would flip switches and draw some of the plentiful electricity a mile down the wires from the station, probably Reactor Number 4, as that was the nearest. The rest would be magic. Life would be magic. \n \n Those were the thoughts that consumed Sirota\u2019s dreams as he went to bed on April 25, 1986, and after he woke on April 26 and rushed off to School No. 1. Looking back ,it was the death of this dreamlike childhood that would come to haunt him \u2013 as much as the months of hospitalizations, as much as the Geiger counter that became his most common clothing accessory, as much as watching his mother\u2019s beautiful, long, blond hair fall out in clumps. \n \n For Sirota, the worst nuclear accident in history didn\u2019t begin dramatically. That morning, he sat in class and contemplated how to best glue colored paper to a jar as a May Day gift for his mother. \n \n We knew, with certainty, with arrogant certainty, that we were in control of the power we were playing with. This was the day . . . we learned we were wrong. Sergiy Parashyn, Chernobyl engineer \n \n \u201cSomeone came in the room and called our teacher, said it was an emergency meeting in the teachers\u2019 meeting room,\u201d Sirota recalls. \u201cWe were told to study quietly. Of course we didn\u2019t. The teachers were gone forever. For more than an hour we sat around. I suppose they were trying to figure out what to do, and it wasn\u2019t an easy discussion. Something was wrong, but we didn\u2019t know exactly what.\u201d \n \n Slowly word filtered through the school that the meeting was about problems at the plant. The kids pressed their noses against the glass of the classroom windows to watch as, across the street, on the manicured lawn of the city\u2019s new hospital, the first military helicopters landed. They were soon surrounded by a jumbled chaos of emergency vehicles. \n \n The kids opened windows and started shouting questions to those milling about on the street below. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d \u201cHave you seen it?\u201d \u201cIs that the army?\u201d But the adults didn\u2019t know much more. It was a fire at the nuclear plant. Someone used the word \u201cavariya,\u201d meaning \u201caccident.\u201d \n \n The aspen, birch, fir and oak trees in the small strip of forest outside the windows blocked their view, but the students knew there was a bridge just a short run away from which they could peer at the accident without obstruction. \n \n \u201cTo kids, it was too tempting to pass up,\u201d Sirota recalls. \n \n He grabbed his jar, some paper and glue \u2013 evidence that he intended to work on the gift \u2013 and sprinted toward the plant. \n \n Sirota wasn\u2019t the first to reach the small bridge, which ran over rail lines on the south side of town, but he remembers that it wasn\u2019t yet crowded, either. He remembers running up to the railing, half throwing himself in the way that boys do, eyes wide, hoping to see excitement. \n \n Instead, he saw smoke, and not enough to hold the attention of a 10-year-old for long. \n \n \u201cIt looked more like fog than fire,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe were looking at the reactor, but we couldn\u2019t see any destruction.\u201d \n \n The bridge they were standing on wasn\u2019t yet known as \u201cThe Bridge of Death.\u201d That would come later. \n \n [SEKTOR 2] \n \n Panic sets in at Reactor Number 4 \n \n Early that morning, just after 1 a.m., while those in Pripyat dozed, the engineers who\u2019d spent the previous 24 hours putting Reactor Number 4 through a stress test were getting nervous. The readings weren\u2019t right. The radiation levels were climbing too high. \n \n But the Soviet mindset at 1 a.m. on April 26, 1986, was very different from what it would be 24 hours later. In fact, the global perception of nuclear power was about to change. \n \n \u201cWe knew, with certainty, with arrogant certainty, that we were in control of the power we were playing with. We could make the forces of nature bend to our will. There was nothing we could not do,\u201d recalls Sergiy Parashyn, who\u2019d been an engineer at the plant since 1977 and had arrived there within the hour. \u201cThis was the day, of course, when we learned we were wrong.\u201d \n \n Parashyn, who later would become the director of the complex and remains one of Ukraine\u2019s foremost experts on nuclear energy, says that as the dials indicated problems, the safe approach would have been to shut down the test. \n \n \u201cIf we had, all would have been well,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was not the course chosen.\u201d \n \n Later reports would call the staff inexperienced, poorly trained. But that was not how they perceived themselves, Parashyn recalls. In their own minds, they were the best and the brightest, leading the way into a glorious future where power was abundant and life would have no limits. Their plant, after all, was only 16 years old. \n \n So as the radiation levels climbed, instead of stopping the test, those in charge ordered it to continue. They would find the limits and learn from that. And when they reached that limit, and the temperature inside the sealed reactor began to climb, and climb beyond expectations, Parashyn says they did what seemed prudent: They hit what he calls \u201cthe shut-down button.\u201d \n \n We knew, with certainty, with arrogant certainty, that we were in control of the power we were playing with. This was the day . . . we learned we were wrong. Sergiy Parashyn, Chernobyl engineer \n \n It turned out to be a huge mistake. \n \n \u201cImagine you are driving a car, quite fast, and you see an obstacle in the road,\u201d he explains. \u201cNaturally, you hit the brakes to slow down and avoid the obstacle. But now imagine that the brakes have been wired incorrectly, and touching the brakes actually acts as an accelerator. When you try to slow down, you speed up, into the obstacle. \n \n \u201cChernobyl was built with this mistake. Had the operators done nothing, it would have been fine \u2013 it would have corrected itself \u2013 but they had no way to know this, until this moment.\u201d \n \n Even 30 years later, nuclear physicists familiar with the disaster disagree on what went wrong. The only area of agreement appears to be that somehow when the engineers attempted to slow the nuclear reaction by inserting control rods into the reactor core, the process actually sped up. \n \n It was a known flaw. Something similar had happened three years earlier during tests in Lithuania, and a warning had gone out, recalls Georgi Kopchinsky, who on April 26, 1986, was a director of the Soviet central committee on nuclear energy. As he talks about Chernobyl, he wrings his hands, smokes nervously and admits it\u2019s a very tough topic for him. \n \n \u201cWe knew this,\u201d he says. \u201cThree years earlier we\u2019d sent out a warning to all plants with reactors with these absorbers, warning of this problem. But no actions had been taken. This was our arrogance at the time. We believed we were the masters of the atomic reactions. It was a horrible mistake.\u201d \n \n When Chernobyl\u2019s operators raised the control rods into the reactor to absorb the flying neutrons and slow down the reaction, the action took only about 15 seconds to complete. But in those seconds, the reaction, instead of slowing, sped up and the temperature inside the reactor reached 3,000 degrees, turning the water used to cool the uranium into steam. \n \n In the sealed environment of the reactor, the steam had no place to expand. That\u2019s when the roof blew, and an estimated 10 tons of the 200 tons of enriched uranium blasted into the atmosphere. \n \n After the roof blew, the walls collapsed and the superheated uranium melted and consumed all that fell into it. The long-term problem was forming, a 2,000-ton mass of metal, concrete and uranium that was pooling below the reactor. \n \n But that was a long-term problem. The more immediate concern was the 10 tons of enriched uranium streaming into the atmosphere above Chernobyl, and spreading out in all directions over northern, eastern and central Europe. Eventually, a scientific report commissioned by the European Parliament would estimate that, to some extent, Chernobyl radiation contaminated 40 percent of Europe. \n \n The time was 1:23 a.m. The world had changed. But those sleeping just downwind had no idea. \n \n [ Sektor 3] \n \n The Bridge of Death \n \n It was about 9 a.m. when Sirota got bored and decided to leave the bridge. \n \n Earlier, in the dark, the bridge had been crowded with adults watching the multicolored flames of burning graphite from the reactor. They\u2019d \u201coohed\u201d and \u201caahed.\u201d It was beautiful. They\u2019d also been soaking up a radiation dose determined to be about 500 roentgen, or two-thirds of a fatal dose. The legend is that none of those who stood on the bridge that morning survived. \n \n Sirota says that isn\u2019t true. He survived. He saw others who survived. Still, as he left the bridge, he was leaving behind many who would soon die agonizing deaths. \n \n All told, about 4,000 people would eventually die from the accident, according to a report by the World Health Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency. \n \n Others say those numbers are wildly low. Alexey Yablokov, a former environment adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, estimated the global death toll to be 1.44 million. Other reports placed the cancer death totals at 30,000 to 60,000. Belarusian physicist Georgiy Lepin, a vice president of the association of liquidators of Chernobyl, the men brought in to fight the fire and clean up, estimated that within a few years, 13,000 rescue workers had died and another 70,000 were left unfit for work. The official number of disabled Chernobyl rescue workers today in Ukraine is 106,000. \n \n A United Nations study says that \u201c5 million people currently live in areas of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine that are contaminated with radionuclides due to the accident; about 100,000 of them live in areas classified in the past by government authorities as areas of \u2018strict control.\u2019 \u201d About 4,000 people, mostly children, developed thyroid cancer from the radiation, the U.N. says; the survival rate for the cancer is 99 percent. \n \n Sirota, of course, knew none of this that morning. \n \n Clutching his jar, his glue, his colored papers, and knowing that school was out, he did what any 10-year-old boy would as the world was collapsing. He ran home to see whether he could find his mom. \n \n She found him. She was dressed for the office, her long blond hair perfect, falling across her shoulders, as always. He noted that she wasn\u2019t happy. She scolded him for his dirty school clothes. She asked if he\u2019d been anywhere near the plant. He lied and said the students had been cleaning the schoolyard, a lie she would not learn about for a decade. \n \n We knew, with certainty, with arrogant certainty, that we were in control of the power we were playing with. This was the day . . . we learned we were wrong. Sergiy Parashyn, Chernobyl engineer \n \n She worked for the Pripyat Palace of Culture. She oversaw the city\u2019s literary needs, bringing in books and writers, and organizing a \u201cWorkers Writing Program.\u201d That day she was hosting a poetry reading. \n \n It was hard to imagine that the news from the plant was bad. The city looked normal. \n \n \u201cShe told me to stay inside until she got home, just in case,\u201d he recalls. \n \n Their apartment was on the southern edge of town, and faced the reactor. From a higher floor, above the trees, he could have looked at it. As it was, he opened the window and straddled the sill, talking with the friends below who had managed to get away from school and then back outside. \n \n They\u2019d talk, then run off and gather another tidbit of information and run back to shout it at him. It became a game. \n \n When his mom returned, it was with the news that they\u2019d need to prepare for a three-day evacuation. As the sky outside his window glowed red, she put him to bed in his coat and boots. He woke to loudspeakers: \u201cAttention, attention, dear comrades. . . . In the interest of the safety of the people, which is a priority to us, there is reason to evacuate.\u201d \n \n The announcement warned that they were to leave at 2 p.m. Buses would be provided, and they\u2019d be taken to their evacuation locations. They were told not to worry. Police would watch their homes and make sure there was no looting. \n \n \u201cOnly take what is necessary and vital documents,\u201d the loudspeakers repeated, over and over. \n \n \u201cWe were going away for a few days. It seemed like a picnic, like an adventure,\u201d Sirota recalls. He filled a little suitcase with two changes of clothes, some pajamas. His mom made room in her bag for a few of his favorite toys. \u201cIt never occurred to me that we wouldn\u2019t be coming back, that this life was over.\u201d \n \n Pripyat, after all, was an ideal place to live. One propaganda poster told residents, \u201cLet the Atom be a Worker, not a Soldier.\u201d The medians dividing fresh new streets were thickly planted with flowers. The towering apartment blocks were still unchipped. The bay cut into the Pripyat River was perfect for swimming in the summers and boating much of the rest of the year. The city hadn\u2019t even had time to install the obligatory statue of Vladimir Lenin on the pedestal awaiting it in the central square. Everything was new and the future promising. \n \n Twenty years before, this was a region of small and poor farming villages. By 1986, it housed the Soviet version of yuppies. Education levels were high. Wages were high. Parents videotaped kids\u2019 parties, just as they would have in the United States. In those videos, the kids looked eerily similar to how they would have looked in Kansas City or Charlotte, from the style of their clothes and haircuts to their broad smiles and constant laughter. \n \n So as the bus pulled out of town, heading toward Kiev 60 miles south, Sirota wasn\u2019t worried. He and his mom were off to spend a couple of nights with his aunt. But he\u2019d be back soon enough. \n \n Those days became weeks, then months, then, after the studies were complete, the official verdict was that people could return to live in Pripyat in 3,000 years. \n \n It became clear he\u2019d left more than clothes and toys behind. He\u2019d never been sick a day in his life before. He was proud of that. His mother bragged about that. \n \n But he spent most of the rest of 1986 in the hospital. He would not be cured, however. Doctors would tell him it was psychosomatic, and the official Ukrainian medical diagnosis for many who complained of radiation-related illnesses after Chernobyl was \u201cradiophobia.\u201d The so-called \u201cChernobyl victims\u201d were more afraid of what had happened than actually sick, went the official line. They should be fine, or at least suffering no more than anyone else. \n \n Sirota would continue to return to the hospital for stays of a month or more every year, at least once, until recently. \n \n \u201cWho knows better what I need now than me?\u201d he asks. \u201cThey give me the medicines and the needles. I take care of myself now.\u201d \n \n His eyes tear up, though, when he looks at photos of his mother\u2019s beautiful hair. \n \n \u201cMost of her hair fell out,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe cuts what\u2019s left very short.\u201d \n \n [ Sektor 4 ] \n \n Calling for help \n \n Kopchinsky, the Soviet nuclear official, remembers the first phone call coming in at about 2 a.m. He was in Moscow at the time. \n \n \u201cSomething had happened at Chernobyl, and it was something bad. That was what we knew.\u201d \n \n Immediately, calls went out for Soviet nuclear experts to gather in Moscow and discuss what to do next. At about the time the sun rose, he says, they got their first indication that \u201cit was very serious.\u201d By 11 a.m. they\u2019d dispatched a planeload of scientists to the site to make a quick assessment. \n \n Something had happened at Chernobyl, and it was something bad. That was what we knew. Georgi Kopchinsky, Soviet nuclear official \n \n On the scene it was chaos, recalls Parashyn, the Chernobyl engineer. \u201cWe had no idea what we were looking at, the depth of the disaster, that first morning,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had meetings, loud meetings, where we tried to figure it out.\u201d \n \n What they figured out was the worst nuclear-energy disaster in human history, far worse than the explosion at Kyshtym nuclear complex in 1957 in what was then the Soviet Union, which released 70 tons of radioactive material into the air, or the 1957 fire at the Windscale Nuclear Reactor in northwestern England, which forced a ban on milk sales for a month, or the Three Mile Island disaster in Pennsylvania on March 29, 1979, where a cooling malfunction led to a partial meltdown. \n \n All of central and eastern Europe was at risk. Even today, in Bavaria in southern Germany, wildlife officials warn hunters not to eat the meat of wild boars, which continue to show high levels of radiation contamination. \n \n Across Europe, children were advised to stay indoors that April and May. In East Berlin, shoppers were astonished to find grocery shelves teeming with fresh lettuce, which usually would have been sent across the wall for wealthier West Berliners. But West Berliners didn\u2019t want the tainted stuff, so East Berlin had salad. \n \n Chernobyl changed the way nuclear engineers viewed nuclear power. \u201cSafety culture\u201d \u2013 the idea that protecting the people and the environment should be emphasized over all other goals \u2013 became the watchword. \n \n Helen Rycraft, a senior nuclear safety officer at the IAEA in Vienna, calls the Chernobyl accident as \u201ca complete watershed.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe entire industry changed,\u201d she says. \n \n \u201cSafety culture had not been properly instilled in nuclear power plants in the USSR prior to the Chernobyl accident,\u201d the IAEA report concludes. \u201cMany of its requirements seem to have existed in regulations, but these were not enforced. Many other necessary features did not exist at all. Local practices at nuclear plants, of which it may be assumed that practices at Chernobyl were typical, did not reflect a safety culture.\u201d \n \n After Chernobyl, Rycraft says, the regime of secrecy and competition that had been the norm among nuclear nations began to erode. \u201cIt taught us we need to learn from each other.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt was the first major accident where organizational issues were identified as a key factor,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Soviets called safety culture \u2018the ghost in the machine.\u2019 It\u2019s the healthy questioning behind every aspect, every detail, of a nuclear program.\u201d \n \n [Sektor 5] \n \n Life in the exclusion zone today \n \n Despite the health problems, Pripyat remained a fundamental part of Sirota\u2019s dreams. He would next see the city six years later, in 1992. He and a friend sneaked in to take a look around at their old home. He remembers being most surprised by the fact that very little had changed. \n \n They\u2019d been told to leave their furniture and most of their clothes behind because officials knew it would all be radioactive. Special teams had come and emptied the contents of the apartments into the streets to be burned, and buried. \n \n But poor and opportunistic Ukrainians had arrived to pick through their belongings before they were destroyed. They found a city filled with treasures, often guarded by nothing more than a threat that seemed less real than a free couch, refrigerator or wardrobe of clothes. \n \n When he recounts what happened 30 years ago, Sirota can vividly recall the details, not because they were wildly dramatic, but because on his visit to his home nothing looked out of place. Windows hadn\u2019t shattered in a nuclear wind. Foundations hadn\u2019t shaken from exploding atoms. The earth didn\u2019t bake in escaping radioactivity. \n \n They say it\u2019s just the warm water that gets them so big. But I don\u2019t think you should eat the fish. Alexandr Sirota \n \n Yet what had been a perfect childhood, in what seemed like a perfect town, and in what they were told was on the edge of a perfect future, had ended, abruptly. \n \n Sirota had hoped beyond reason to gain it back when a few years ago he bought a small house at the end of a gravel lane just outside the the exclusion zone imposed around the old reactor. Move the modest but sturdy house across the pasture and it would be inside an area identified as unsafe for human habitation for the next 3,000 years. \n \n There are several reasons he moved back to the area. For one, his house, on a decent plot of land, cost the equivalent of just $125. Even in poor rural Ukraine, that\u2019s cheap. \n \n It would be even cheaper inside the exclusion zone. Ukrainian officials are known to have turned a blind eye to a small group of very poor, and illegal, residents who returned to the homes standing inside the forbidden zone. Officials estimate that 197 squatters hide there. And for short spells, workers can live inside the zone. There\u2019s even a hotel for overnight visits. \n \n The wildlife is tough to beat. Wolves and bears and big cats, even wild horses, thrive inside the perimeter. In a field across the road from Sirota\u2019s house, he points to the wild Przewalski\u2019s horses. Originally from Central Asia, they\u2019re endangered, wiped out in many of their former ranges. They seem to thrive around his house. \n \n Still, he\u2019s painfully aware that the radiation settled into the soil, from which it\u2019s drawn into the roots of trees and grass and mushrooms. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t eat the mushrooms from here,\u201d he says. \u201cI avoid eating the game. That\u2019s what they tell us: We\u2019re safe as long as we don\u2019t.\u201d \n \n But many do. At the tiny grocery in his 600-resident village of Dytyatky, he points out a freezer of local cuts of meat. The cuts are roughly done, uneven, hunters\u2019 cuts of meat, not a butcher\u2019s clean, even meat packages. \n \n When 70-year-old Maria is asked whether she worries about the health risks of food coming from so close to Chernobyl, she waves a hand and spits: \u201cAch, radiation. I can\u2019t see it. Why should I worry?\u201d \n \n Sirota worries, but he\u2019s drawn to this place. He lives with a Geiger counter around his neck. He carries a second one in case the first malfunctions. \n \n The constant clicking as the Geiger counter measures the local radiation serves as a soundtrack to his life. The faster the clicking, the higher the radiation levels. When the clicking goes into overdrive, he moves on, to find a place where the levels are safer. \n \n Even at home, resting or cooking, the clicking is constant, click . . . click . . .click. \n \n His work these days is showing visitors around the irradiated area. A couple of days a week he passes through the heavily guarded gates into the contaminated zone. It\u2019s how he earns a living. \n \n \u201cPeople want to see this,\u201d he explains. \u201cI can understand the curiosity, but there isn\u2019t much to see.\u201d \n \n Then, in what used to be the plant\u2019s lagoon running along the edge of the Pripyat River, he shows off the 9-foot-long catfish. In the summer, he\u2019ll toss loaves of bread and watch their long bodies spiral over one another in the muddy water as they dine. \n \n \u201cThey say it\u2019s just the warm water that gets them so big,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think you should eat the fish.\u201d \n \n His Geiger counter has gone from fast clicks to a solid buzz (clickclickclickclick). \n \n [Sektor 6] \n \n A million years of problems \n \n When the steam burst through the roof of Reactor Number 4 in 1986, it took with it 5 percent of the enriched uranium. That means 10 tons vanished. It also means 95 percent, or 190 tons, remained. They\u2019re still there. \n \n After the blasted reactor partially collapsed into the nuclear material, it created a radioactive blob of uranium, concrete, steel and assorted junk weighing about 2,000 tons. Ideally, Ukraine would remove the material. Sergiy Parashyn grabs a pen and paper as he talks about the problems with that. \n \n \u201cWe do not know how to do this,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe do not have the technology to do this. It must be something new.\u201d \n \n He sketches the blob, then makes a quick drawing of a tractor with a scoop on one side and a large rotating blade on the other. He smiles at the crude drawing, then shrugs. \n \n \u201cOne problem is that the material is decaying and is brittle, and when we cut it up to transport it to disposal bins, it will very likely fill the air with radioactive dust,\u201d he explains. So the tractor has to be able to operate in a radioactive environment, it has to be able to control and eliminate any dust and it has to operate in an area that will not be at all safe for humans. \u201cMaybe something like this would work, maybe it wouldn\u2019t. We don\u2019t know. That\u2019s a problem.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s a problem because while 5 percent of the radioactive material caused problems that continue 30 years later and will continue to cause problems for eons to come, the other 95 percent of the material could represent about 20 times the problems. \n \n For instance, if mistakes are made and the brittle material is released into the atmosphere, they\u2019re back to square one. If the material gets into the Pripyat River, it will flow into the Dnieper River. The Dnieper River is the water source for Kiev. The Dnieper is the primary water source for much of Ukraine. \n \n Clearly, nothing man made is more than temporary, and therefore it isn\u2019t adequate. Detlef Appel, geologist \n \n This is why Ukrainian officials are counting on what they call a sarcophagus to contain the site, a massive structure that looks like a Quonset hut being assembled behind a wall that is intended to deflect radiation from the decaying plant from workers. \n \n When finished, it will be rolled across the crumbling concrete of the surrounding ground to cover and further seal the dangerous reactor. The work is expected to be completed in 2018, though that is just a guess. It\u2019s expected to last 100 years. It\u2019s not nearly long enough. \n \n Reactor Number 4 today is essentially an unplanned nuclear-waste dump. To serve in that role requires it to last for 3,000 years. That means the area surrounding Chernobyl will be safe to inhabit by people again in the year 4986. \n \n How likely is that? To get an idea of what it means to contain and control a deadly and potentially devastating radioactive pile in Ukraine for 3,000 years, consider what the world looked like 3,000 years ago: \n \n The Iron Age was beginning. The Trojan War was fairly recent news. Egypt had Pharaohs. King David was succeeded by his son, Solomon. Canaanites were the big world traders. Christ was 1,000 years from showing up. Muhammad was 1,500 years away. \n \n The legendary founding of Rome, of Romulus and Remus and the wolf, wouldn\u2019t take place for 300 years. \n \n It\u2019s not simply that a lot has changed in the last 3,000 years, it\u2019s that almost everything has. \n \n And yet, Detlef Appel, a geologist who runs PanGeo, a Hamburg, Germany, company that consults on such nuclear storage issues, notes that 3,000 years probably isn\u2019t long enough. He suggests that truly safe radioactive waste storage needs to extend a million years into the future. Think back to when man\u2019s earliest relative began to walk the Earth. \n \n \u201cWe can trust human endeavor, perhaps, for a few hundred years, though that is doubtful,\u201d he said. \u201cStorage implies a way to retrieve the materials. It requires trained personnel, maintenance, updating and security. Clearly, nothing man made is more than temporary, and therefore it isn\u2019t adequate.\u201d \n \n Even the continents will have moved in a million years. \n \n Tetiana Verbytska, an energy policy expert at the National Ecological Center of Ukraine, worries that people are far too easygoing about Chernobyl. Among government officials right now, mindful of the 30-year anniversary, there is a movement to shrink the radius of the highly contaminated no man\u2019s land from 18 miles to 6. \n \n \u201cThe move to reduce the highly contaminated zone has nothing to do with science and everything to do with public relations,\u201d she says. \u201cIn Ukraine, each April we make wonderful speeches about our commitment to dealing with this problem, and the rest of each year we hope the problem will just go away.\u201d \n \n There are other reasons to worry. Ukraine is creaking under a civil war against insurgents backed by Russia and scraping by with an economy that in the decades since the collapse of the Soviet Union has been looted by a series of oligarchs. It doesn\u2019t have the money to fund an educational system that can be expected to create legions of top scientists and engineers. \n \n Officials speak very proudly of the new sarcophagus roof that is being put into place. But the finish date on that has been repeatedly backed up, and there\u2019s no guarantee that its 2018 date won\u2019t be moved again. \n \n A variety of disasters could still strike. The site\u2019s existing covering, built in haste after the accident, could collapse, shattering the brittle mix of radioactive materials below and sending nuclear dust into the atmosphere to mix with rain. There could be an earthquake. The entire site is fragile. \n \n Olga Kosharna, the lead scientist at the Ukrainian Department of Energy and Nuclear Safety in Kiev who oversaw safety at Chernobyl in the 1990s, recalls walking the roof above the shattered reactor and being horrified to find holes that had been burned through the concrete. \n \n The shoes she wore that day were highly contaminated and had to be destroyed. \n \n Alexandre Polack, a spokesman for the European Union, notes in an email that the date to begin removing radioactive material from the site is still 20 to 30 years away. \u201cThe current shelter covering destroyed Reactor 4 was reinforced in recent years and seems stable,\u201d he writes. \u201cHowever it was built in haste after the accident and never intended as a long-term solution.\u201d \n \n Verbytska emphasizes that the mass of uranium debris inside Reactor Number 4 is now a mess that goes beyond human ability to clean up. Others dismiss the situation as a problem, but one that technology can fix. \n \n \u201cWe don\u2019t have the technology to fix the problem,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the process to develop the technology to fix the problem, and we don\u2019t have the money to support the process to develop the technology to fix the problem. The solutions for our Chernobyl problems are very much \u2018seal it for now.\u2019 We will have smart children and smart grandchildren who in 100 years or so will figure out what to do.\u201d \n \n [Sektor 7] \n \n A modern Pompeii \n \n After the disaster, radiation burned off the tops of the trees. Soviet officials ordered the trees cut down and buried deep. But they failed to properly encase the buried wood. As a new forest grew unchecked above the radioactive remains of the old forest, the new wood was also highly radioactive. The whole thing will have to be dug up and encased and buried again, properly. \n \n Still, Sirota burns it for warmth, though he acknowledges that is probably unsafe. \n \n Sirota\u2019s tour takes him across the Bridge of Death, which looks just as remote and harmless today as it did to him that morning, and on into Pripyat, which remains a modern Pompeii, a city abandoned in an instant, the trappings of what had been daily life left where they lay. \n \n The difference is that while Pompeii is carefully managed for tourists, Pripyat is still very much an outlier on the tourist map: perhaps Pompeii were Vesuvius still erupting. \n \n The roads remain wide, though they\u2019re overgrown today, vividly, eerily green. Trees grow out of old manholes, and through cracks in the old parade ground. The lichen on the trees is long, spindly, beautiful and eerie. There is a plastic baby doll in the doorway of an old administrative building. Sirota notes the doll is clearly Western in style and that it appears to have been left by a photographer trying to add emotional impact, to conjure memories of the children who once lived and played here. \n \n \u201cIf you need to see the children who were once here, I\u2019m here,\u201d he explains. \n \n In his old school, a textbook remains on a desk. It is open to pages decorated with drawings of missiles and tanks and warplanes, the Cyrillic words reminding readers, \u201cThe stars of the Kremlin shine everywhere. . . . The children have a beautiful homeland. A better one does not exist.\u201d \n \n Sirota\u2019s eyes often develop red rims as he talks about his old home, though he wipes away the tears before they run down his cheeks. \n \n \u201cObviously, I\u2019m drawn to Chernobyl,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s the source of the greatest sadness of my life, but that\u2019s also because it was the source of my greatest joy. I feel that the accident at the plant stole a perfect childhood, a perfect life, from me. I know this isn\u2019t rational, but I stay here, hoping that someday I might get it back.\u201d ||||| Chernobyl's exclusion zone to be revived with solar \n \n The Ukrainian government has announced plans to use Chernobyl's nuclear wasteland for solar energy generation. Meanwhile in Belarus, a 22.3 MW PV plant is already under construction in Brahin district, around 20 miles from Chernobyl. \n \n Flickr/thisisbossi One time European PV power plant leader, Ukraine is turning back to solar in unlikely places. \n \n 30 years after the Chernobyl accident, the Ukrainian government aims to give a new renewable life to thousands hectares of the exclusion zone in the northern part of the country. While long-lasting radiation makes the area unfit for human habitation, agriculture or forestry, its cheap land and remaining electric transmission facilities can be used for solar power generation. \n \n \u201cLand and transmission line connection are the most expensive parts of any solar project, and we have both of them here,\u201d general director of the Chernobyl plant Igor Gramotkin told local news outlets in April, when the country was commemorating the 30th anniversary of the nuclear disaster. \n \n At the end of June, Ukraine's minister of the environment and natural resources Ostap Semerak presented country's plans for the revival of the exclusion zone at Canada-Ukraine Business Forum in Toronto. After the forum, he announced that a number of Canadian investors are looking at developing solar and biofuel power plants near Chernobyl. \n \n Semerak also noted that the implementation of such projects requires new legislation in terms of allocation of land in the exclusion zone. \u201cWe expect that this issue will be fully settled by the end of the current session of Parliament. In early June, the corresponding bill already passed a first reading,\u201d the minister said. \n \n In a recent interview Semerak has confirmed that the ministry of environmental and natural resources was already negotiating with two U.S. investment firms and four Canadian energy companies interested in the Chernobyl's solar potential. Ukrainian developers plan to install a 4 MW project at the site by the end of the year, Bloomberg reports. \n \n According to the ministry of environmental and natural resources, 34 solar power plants with the total capacity of over 120 MW are scheduled to be completed in Ukraine in 2016. Despite the political and economic difficulties facing the country, Ukraine is aiming to increase the share of renewables in its energy mix up to 11% by 2020, the ministry reports. \n \n As recent developments demonstrate, after several years of stagnation, international solar developers have begun showing renewed interest in Ukraine. Yesterday, a 4 MW PV plant was successfully connected to the grid in Vysokopillya, a southern part of the country. According to the developer, the German-based Work Team, heavy rainfall, snow, and freezing rain have frequently posed challenges for solar developers in the area. China-based PV-inverter manufacturer Sungrow supplied its SG60KTL inverters for the PV plant. \n \n Belarus' PV plan for Chernobyl \n \n Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbor, has its own solar plans for the land affected by the Chernobyl disaster. In April this year, the telecommunications company Velcom, a subsidiary of the Austrian company Telecom, announced an investment of more than \u20ac23 million ($ 25.3 million) for a 22.3 MW PV plant in Brahin district, located at the Ukrainian border, next to the nuclear wasteland. \n \n Velcom is planning to sell the generated electricity, as well as use it for the company's needs. \u201cWe expect the solar plant to cover about 50% of the company's energy needs and pay itself off in four to five years\u201d, Velcom CEO Helmut Duhs said at a press-conference in Minsk. He added that the company had chosen this particular area not only because of its southern location but also because of the cheap price land prices. \n \n According to the company, the solar facility in Brahin district will be comprised of 85,000 PV panels installed across the area of 56 hectares. The construction works are scheduled to be completed by the end of this summer.",
    "reference_summary": "\u2013 If anything, the land in the 1,000-square-mile exclusion zone left largely untouched since the Chernobyl disaster of 1986 is cheap. After all, studies suggest it won't be inhabitable until the year 4986, reported McClatchy DC in April, and pretty much nothing can be harvested from it. But now Ostap Semerak, Ukraine's environment minister, is drumming up foreign interest in solar power projects across the wasteland, which he says is uniquely, if a bit ironically, suited to renewables, reports Bloomberg. PV Magazine reports that Igor Gramotkin, today the general director of the Chernobyl plant, in April pointed out that \"land and transmission line connection\" are the most expensive elements of a solar undertaking. Lucky then, that \"we already have high-voltage transmission lines that were previously used for the nuclear stations,\" says Semerak. \"And we have many people trained to work at power plants\" (thousands still work at Chernobyl). Plus there's all that inexpensive land. Ukraine's interest in renewables is partly politically motivated given the fragile cease-fire with Kremlin-backed rebels near the Russian border, not to mention increasing friction with the Putin camp over natural gas bills. Semerak says four energy companies from Canada and two investment firms from the US have expressed interest in a solar complex at the Chernobyl site, while Ukrainian developers intend to install panels there before 2016 is through. (Apparently human habitation is worse for wildlife than radiation, according to this exclusion-zone activity.)",

The accident occurred in the early morning hours \u2013 Twenty years ago this week, the world's worst nuclear disaster took place in Ukraine. On Tuesday, the 25th anniversary of the April 1986 meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, President Viktor Yanukovich marked the occasion with a speech in which he called the disaster \"the worst catastrophe in the history of mankind\" and promised that it would never happen again, the New York Times reports. \"We will not allow ourselves to be provoked into a nuclear war,\" he said.

But do they go around having it the way that gay men do?\" \n \n Germaine Greer, the eminent feminist author and academic, said Fry\u2019s remarks were \u201cgratuitous\u201d and accused the broadcaster of having \u201cdelusions of grandeur\u201d. \n \n She said: \u201cStephen Fry is clearly under a delusion that he is an authority on female sexuality. Well, if he thinks that women are not interested in genital encounters with total strangers then he is absolutely right. But to conclude that we are therefore uninterested in sex is madness. \n \n \u201cIt is true that men have an interest in a kind of sex which women find infinitely depressing, and it\u2019s true that women really don\u2019t want to hang around toilets hoping that someone will come along and play with their bits. That is not what passion is about for us and we would be placing ourselves in mortal danger if it was. \n \n \u201cWomen have an idea of passion which men like Stephen can\u2019t even begin to imagine. What women yearn for is intimacy. The fact that for women sex is an integral part of closeness doesn\u2019t mean we are any less interested in it.\u2019 \n \n Rosie Boycott, the feminist journalist, also denounced Fry\u2019s outburst as \u201crubbish\u201d. \n \n She said: \u201cWomen are just as capable as men are of enjoying sex. We don't go cruising or cottaging on Hampstead Heath because we don't need to.\u201d \n \n Paul Flynn, the journalist who interviewed Fry, said: \"I thought it was quite an odd generalisation to make at the time, but he delivered it with certainty and it was clearly something he'd thought about.\" \n \n Fry also used his interview to disclose details of the \u201cextraordinary underworld\u201d of cottaging \u2013 anonymous sex between homosexual men in public lavatories - with which he was \u201cslightly obsessed\u201d in his youth. \n \n RELATED PRODUCT",

Actor Stephen Fry tweeted \"Bye Bye\" to his 1.9 million followers after he claimed he was misquoted in a magazine interview that women don't enjoy sex. According to the interview, the homosexual celebrity, 53, said women obviously aren't interested in sex because they don't seek out casual encounters on the street, reports the Telegraph. He said women only have sex because that's \"the price they are willing to pay\" for a relationship. \"If women liked sex as much as men, there would be straight cruising areas in the way there are gay cruising areas,\" the magazine Attitude quotes him as saying. \"Women would go and hang around in churchyards thinking: 'God, I've got to get my f****ing rocks off', or they'd go to Hampstead Heath and meet strangers to shag behind a bush.\" He added: \"I feel sorry for straight men.\" Fry insists he was misquoted in the story that triggered a firestorm of criticism, though he hasn't clarified his comments. \"Now I'm the AntiChrist,\" he complained.

    "document": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Two and a half weeks after Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta announced an inquiry into e-mail exchanges between Gen. John R. Allen of the Marines and a socialite in Tampa, Fla., some 15 investigators working seven days a week in the Pentagon inspector general\u2019s office have narrowed their focus to 60 to 70 e-mails that \u201cbear a fair amount of scrutiny,\u201d a defense official said. \n \n The official did not disclose the content of the e-mails, but senior Pentagon officials have described the voluminous correspondence between General Allen, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, and the socialite, Jill Kelley, as potentially \u201cinappropriate communication.\u201d Law enforcement officials say the e-mails number in the hundreds and cover a period of two and a half years starting in 2010, when General Allen was the deputy commander of Central Command, based in Tampa. \n \n The investigation, which is delaying and could derail General Allen\u2019s appointment to be the NATO supreme allied commander in Europe, is on a fast track but is unlikely to be completed before the end of the year. Investigations of senior officers in the inspector general\u2019s office usually take about seven months on average, although normally there are only two or three investigators assigned to a case. \n \n The defense official, who asked not to be named because of the nature of the inquiry, said investigators were trying to determine whether the e-mails violated Defense Department policy, government regulations or military law. They were discovered in the course of an F.B.I. investigation into anonymous e-mails to Ms. Kelley warning her to stay away from David H. Petraeus, then the C.I.A. director. The F.B.I. found that the e-mails had been sent by Paula Broadwell, Mr. Petraeus\u2019s biographer; he admitted to having had an affair with Ms. Broadwell and resigned on Nov. 9. \n \n Like General Allen, Mr. Petraeus, a retired four-star general, was a social acquaintance of Ms. Kelley when he was stationed at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, headquarters of the Central Command. \n \n The e-mails between General Allen and Ms. Kelley were sent to the Pentagon by the F.B.I. on Nov. 11. \u201cThey just forwarded the evidence,\u201d the official said, referring to the F.B.I. \u201cPeople have to go through and decide if they fit one of three potential violations.\u201d Those violations include misconduct, which could range from inappropriate language on a government computer to adultery, prohibited under military law; more than an incidental use of government property for personal matters; and security breaches. \n \n The defense official said there was no evidence so far that there had been security violations. General Allen, who is in Kabul planning the drawdown of American forces from Afghanistan, is cooperating with the investigation and has said through associates that he did not commit adultery. The inquiry does not appear to have progressed to interviews with General Allen, 58, who is married and the father of two, or Ms. Kelley, 37, the wife of a cancer surgeon and the mother of three. \n \n Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., who has been nominated to succeed General Allen as part of a regular military rotation, is expected to be confirmed by the Senate before the end of the year and to be in Kabul by February. General Allen is expected to return to the United States at that time, but it is unclear what he will do. \n \n There have been conflicting accounts of the nature of the e-mails between him and Ms. Kelley. A law enforcement official has described some of them as sexually explicit. Pentagon officials briefed on the matter say they have been told that half a dozen are embarrassing. But General Allen\u2019s associates say they are innocuous and contain little beyond language like \u201cyou\u2019re a sweetheart.\u201d \n \n Although Ms. Kelley\u2019s e-mail correspondence with General Allen has not been made public, dozens of her e-mails to Mayor Bob Buckhorn of Tampa have been released under Florida\u2019s public record laws and refer to her friendship with both General Allen and Mr. Petraeus. \n \n A year ago, after inviting the mayor to a birthday party for one of her children, she added a casual P.S.: \u201cI\u2019ll be in DC this weekend with Petraeus, but let\u2019s set up a double date when I return!\u201d Last January, she wrote to a mayoral aide, \u201cI\u2019m up in DC having dinner tonight with Gen. Petraeus and Gen. John Allen.\u201d ||||| FILE - In this Nov 13, 2012 file photo Jill Kelley leaves her home in Tampa, Fla. The Tampa socialite at the center of a scandal involving Gen.

The Tampa socialite at the center of a scandal involving Gen. David Petraeus has hired a top Washington attorney and seems... (Associated Press) \n \n Jill Kelley wants the world to know that she didn't do anything wrong when she befriended top military brass. \n \n The Tampa socialite at the center of a scandal involving Gen. David Petraeus has hired a top Washington attorney and seems to be trying to change the narrative about her friendship with the general, her past and her role as an \"honorary consul\" to the country of South Korea. \n \n On Tuesday, Kelley's attorney Abbe Lowell released emails, telephone recordings and other material that he and Kelley say proves she never tried to exploit her friendship with Petraeus. \n \n Lowell wrote to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tampa, demanding to know why the name of his client and her husband were revealed during the FBI's investigation of Petraeus and his mistress, Paula Broadwell. \n \n Officials said they were led to Kelley because Broadwell sent her threatening messages to stay away from Petraeus. Lowell addressed this in a letter to W. Stephen Muldrow, the assistant U.S. Attorney in Tampa. \n \n \"You no doubt have seen the tremendous attention that the Kelleys have received in the media,\" Lowell wrote. \"All they did to receive this attention was to let law enforcement know that they had been the subjects of inappropriate and potentially threatening behavior by someone else.\" \n \n Lowell added that federal privacy laws could be applicable to the couple's information. \n \n \"These leaks most certainly had to come, at least in part, from government sources,\" Lowell said. \"The earliest and best example of the leaks would be the release to the media of the names of my clients. As you know, there are several rules and laws that seek to protect United States citizens against such leaks.\" \n \n The U.S. Attorney's Office in Tampa did not return telephone calls for comment Tuesday. \n \n Kelley, a 37-year-old mother of three, became the focus of national media attention earlier this month. She and her husband, cancer surgeon Scott Kelley, befriended Petraeus and Gen. John Allen when the generals served at U.S. Central Command, which is headquartered at Tampa's MacDill Air Force Base. Kelley became an unofficial social ambassador for the base. She was well known around Tampa's social scene and often hosted parties at her waterfront mansion. \n \n When the FBI investigated Broadwell's emails to Kelley, they also discovered numerous emails between Kelley and the generals. The Pentagon is investigating the emails between her and Allen. Some have called a few of the emails between the two \"flirtatious,\" but sources close to Kelley say they were not. \n \n The scandal this week cost Kelley her appointment as an honorary consul for the South Korean government, which she had gotten because of her friendship with Petraeus. The Koreans said she had misused the title in her personal business dealings. \n \n Lowell sent another letter to a businessman for whom Kelley tried to broker a deal with South Korea. \n \n The businessman, Adam Victor, said he met Kelley in late August at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, where they discussed having Kelley represent Victor's company on a coal-gasification deal it was negotiating with South Korean companies. \n \n On Aug. 30, according to the documents provided by her attorney, Victor sent Kelley an email saying they were seeking bids from four major Korean firms _ Samsung, Hyundai, GS and GK _ and that he expected the bidding to potentially reach $3 billion. There were several back-and-forth emails through mid-September as Victor and Kelley tried to negotiate a fee for her work, with her saying she was seeking 2 percent of the deal and Victor trying to clarify what she meant. \n \n There were no other emails until Victor sent one Nov. 9, when Kelley's name surfaced in the Petraeus scandal. He wrote two more times after that before she responded. \n \n When she finally did, he sent back another email in which he remarked, \"When I heard about Petraeus, I thought of you.\" In a follow-up email, he asked if she was still in a position to help with Korea. She didn't respond. \n \n In a Nov. 14 interview with the AP, Victor said it had become clear that Kelley was not a skilled negotiator and that he had wasted his time dealing with her. \n \n In a letter released Tuesday and dated Nov. 21, Lowell accused Victor of seeking his \"15 minutes of fame\" by talking to the news media about his client. Lowell said Victor had defamed Kelley with his clients and misstated her desire for 2 percent of the profits by saying she wanted 2 percent of the entire deal. Lowell also accused Victor of unspecified inappropriate behavior toward Kelley. \n \n \"If you want to continue seeking publicity for yourself, that is one thing,\" Lowell wrote to Victor. \"However, if you do that by maligning a person, that is something else.\" He then accused Victor of casting Kelley in a false light and suggested his attorney contact Lowell to discuss the matter. \n \n Victor told the AP late Tuesday that he never accused Kelley of wrongdoing, but had just said she was naive and not an experienced negotiator. He also said his female assistant was present every time he met with Kelley. \n \n \"It's not a crime to be a novice,\" Victor said. \"I don't know why they are talking to me.\" \n \n The third letter was sent from Kelley's attorney Tuesday to the Attorney Consumer Assistance Program, which handles complaints about lawyers on behalf of the Florida Bar. In that letter, Lowell accused Tampa attorney Barry Cohen of breaking attorney-client privilege by publicly speaking about conversations he had with Kelley in 2009 while representing her in a dispute she had with a tenant. In those conversations, Lowell said, they discussed her friendships with various military personnel. \n \n Kelley's sister, Natalie Khawam, once worked as an attorney in Cohen's firm and later sued him for sexual harassment and breach of contract. In court responses, Cohen said Khawam \"has a judicially documented recent history and continuing propensity for the commission of perjury.\" \n \n Cohen said Tuesday evening that he had not seen Lowell's complaint letter and that Kelley had \"lost the battle in the court of public opinion.\" \n \n \"No matter how many high-priced lawyers and publicists she employs, she has been exposed for what she is,\" he said. \n \n Prior to Tuesday, Kelley, her attorney and her publicist had only publicly addressed the situation once, in a statement to the news media when the scandal first broke. \n \n ___ \n \n Spencer reported from Miami. \n \n Kelley's lawyer also sent letters to a New York businessman who accused her of incompetence in her work trying to set up a deal he was negotiating with South Korean companies and a Tampa attorney who accused her of name-dropping and of being a social climber; \n \n Follow Tamara Lush on Twitter at http://twitter.com/tamaralush",

Those investigators aren't the only ones getting busy. A previously silent Kelley is now defending herself, through her attorney. Abbe Lowell, a big-time Washington lawyer who has represented Bill Clinton and John Edwards, yesterday released emails, phone recordings, and more evidence that, he says, prove Kelley did not try to exploit her relationship with David Petraeus. He also sent out three letters connected to the scandal, the AP reports: He asked the US Attorney's Office in Tampa why Kelley's name was released in the first place, adding that federal privacy laws could apply. He wrote another letter to a businessman Kelley was trying to help make a deal with South Korea, before she lost her honorary consul status.

We've got to get our vote out. \n \n \"If I had to predict,\" McCain told anchor Harry Smith, \"and I'm very hesitant to do so, I think we will be up late, or even after election night, waiting to see what happens in California and the state of Washington. I think the election will probably depend on that, as far as Senate majority.\" \n \n Special Report: Campaign 2010 \n \n As a co-sponsor of campaign finance legislation that was all but gutted by the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United, which allowed unfettered spending of money from anonymous donors (including corporations, industry groups, unions and non-profits), McCain said the current glut of spending by House and Senate (according to the Washington Post, nearly $2 billion for this midterm) and by outside groups (an additional nearly half-billion dollars, much from hidden sources), was feared. \n \n \"Yeah, we were worried about that,\" said McCain (who alone spent about $20 million to defeat his primary opponent J.D.

Or money like the unions that spend without the permission of union members - obviously many union members who don't agree with the far left agenda of the union leadership. \n \n \"So, it is what it is, and we're in for an interesting election.\" \n \n Looking ahead, McCain was asked about the prospect of compromise in Congress over the Bush era tax cuts, which are due to expire at the end of this year. While most agree that tax cuts for middle class Americans should be extended, battle lines have been drawn against whether the richest two percent of Americans should also have their tax cuts continued. \n \n Doing so, Democrats argue, would increase the federal deficit by $700 billion over the next decade. \n \n Though a recent CBS news poll shows a majority of Americans say tax cuts for those making $250,000 a year should not continue, Republicans are fighting for them. \n \n \"Democrats are floating the idea of moving that ceiling up to $1 million a year,\" said Smith. \"If the Bush tax cuts, which are up for renewal, come up again and they say, 'You know what, we'll just only tax people who make $1 million or more,' is that something you might be able to stomach?\" \n \n \"Look, let's just extend them all for a couple of years and then worry about it, and see what happens a couple years from now,\" McCain replied. \"We're not going to get into a bidding war with the Democrats over what level [of] rich people we hate. \n \n \"Look, we don't need to raise anybody's taxes at this time. Let's extend them for a couple of years, as 45 Democrats in the House said that they were committed to [doing], and let's start attacking the real problem, and that's spending. \n \n \"Taxes isn't the problem; it's spending that's the problem.

If the group of Democrats suing the Badger State are successful, every state will have to follow new rules when they draw congressional and legislative maps. Milwaukee Journal Sentinel \n \n The U.S. Supreme Court building. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite) \n \n WASHINGTON - U.S. Supreme Court justices showed deep divisions Tuesday over a gerrymandering case from Wisconsin that could have far-reaching national implications. \n \n Liberal justices expressed openness to the idea that courts should intervene when lawmakers draw election maps that greatly favor their party. Conservatives were skeptical that judges could come up with a way to determine whether and when legislators had gone too far. \n \n In the middle of it all \u2014 as expected \u2014 was Justice Anthony Kennedy. Both sides see him as the one who will likely cast the deciding vote and they pitched their arguments to him. \n \n A three-judge panel last year ruled 2-1 that maps for the Wisconsin Assembly were so heavily Republican that they violated the constitutional rights of Democratic voters. Now, the Supreme Court must decide whether the lower court got the ruling right. \n \n Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg questioned what would happen to the \"precious right to vote\" with maps like Wisconsin's that lock in a majority for one party. \n \n \"If you can stack a legislature in this way, what incentive is there for a voter to exercise his vote?\" she asked. \"Whether it's a Democratic district or a Republican district, the result \u2014 using this map, the result is preordained in most of the districts.\" \n \n I never ask for God to choose sides but with the eroding of our democracy I pray God's will includes #fairMaps! This is for all the marbles! https://t.co/S21Y2rVnmt \u2014 Vice Chair,Rep Bowen (@DavidFBowen) October 2, 2017 \n \n RELATED: Redistricting case could ripple beyond Wisconsin \n \n RELATED: Federal court strikes down GOP-drawn maps \n \n RELATED: Court to Wisconsin Republicans: Redraw election maps \n \n Chief Justice John Roberts countered that legislatures have long been the ones in most states to determine where political lines are drawn. \n \n \u201cThe whole point is you\u2019re taking these issues away from democracy and you're throwing them into the courts,\" he told the attorney for the group of Wisconsin voters who brought the case. \n \n If they succeed, the nation's high court will have to decide in case after case whether to toss out maps favoring one party over the other, he said. And the public will suspect the court's rulings are based on partisanship, he warned. \n \n \u201cThat is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of the country,\" he said. \n \n The stakes are high for Wisconsin's Democrats, who have been out of power for seven years. The case represents one of their last shots \u2014 if not their very last shot \u2014 of gaining a foothold in the Legislature in the foreseeable future. \n \n But the case could also have a broad national impact. If Wisconsin's maps are thrown out, states will have to follow new rules when they draw congressional and legislative districts, limiting their abilities to give edges to either party. \n \n The packed gallery included Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican former governor of California who has championed redistricting reform, and Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald (R-Juneau), one of the top leaders to sign off on the GOP-friendly maps. \n \n The Supreme Court has long wrestled with the question of whether maps can be so one-sided as to violate the Constitution. \n \n Both sides focused their arguments on Kennedy, who has written that overly partisan maps can violate the Constitution but that courts have never had a way to measure when that happens. \n \n He asked Erin Murphy, an attorney for the Wisconsin Legislature, whether it would violate the Constitution for a state to pass a law that required lawmakers to draw maps that gave maximum advantage to one side (while still complying with traditional redistricting principles). \n \n \u201cI\u2019d like the answer to the question,\" Kennedy said. \n \n Murphy said such a law would violate the Constitution, but emphasized that no such law was in effect in this case. \n \n Wisconsin Solicitor General Misha Tseytlin \u2014 a former Kennedy clerk \u2014 argued Wisconsin's maps are constitutionally sound and contended a victory by the Democrats would prompt a slew of litigation across the country. \n \n He told the justices the plaintiffs hope to \"launch a redistricting revolution\" that would force maps around the country to be redrawn. \n \n \"I would expect that almost every single map drawn by a legislature will be challenged immediately if plaintiffs prevail,\" he said by email before Tuesday's arguments. \n \n Those bringing the case disputed that, saying litigation could advance only in states with the most extreme maps. \n \n Paul Smith of the Campaign Legal Center argued the case on behalf of the Democratic voters from Wisconsin. He told the court it was the \"only institution\" in America that could prevent lawmakers from drawing maps that helped themselves at the expense of voters. \n \n \u201cPoliticians are never going to fix gerrymandering,\" he said. \"They like gerrymandering.\u201d \n \n The map for the Wisconsin Assembly, he said, \"is so extreme that it effectively nullifies democracy.\" \n \n The center, based in Washington, D.C., hopes to curb partisan gerrymandering by both sides. Some Republicans \u2014 including Schwarzenegger, U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Ohio Gov. John Kasich \u2014 are siding with the Wisconsin Democrats. \n \n \u201dI say it is time to say hasta la vista to gerrymandering and it is time to terminate gerrymandering,\" Schwarzenegger said on the plaza outside the court. \n \n Every 10 years, states must draw new election maps to account for population shifts. In Wisconsin and most other states, politicians get to draw those lines. \n \n Republicans took full control of Wisconsin's government in the 2010 elections and used their power to draw maps that greatly favor them. \n \n Democratic voters sued in 2015, arguing their voting rights had been violated, and the panel of judges sided with them last year. (Unlike other types of cases, redistricting lawsuits are first heard by a panel of three judges and then go directly to the Supreme Court.) \n \n ARCHIVE: Democrats sue state election officials over 2011 redistricting \n \n The Supreme Court is expected to rule by summer. \n \n Wisconsin is often closely divided, but that doesn't reveal itself in legislative races. \n \n In 2012 \u2014 a year when Democratic President Barack Obama handily won Wisconsin \u2014 Democrats received nearly 52% of the vote in Assembly races, yet took just 39 of the chamber\u2019s 99 seats. \n \n In last year's election, Republican Donald Trump topped Democrat Hillary Clinton by the slimmest of margins in the presidential race, but the Republicans laid claim to a 64-35 majority in the Assembly. \n \n The Democratic voters who brought the lawsuit contend both sides should have an equal chance to capture the same number of seats. If one side can get 60 seats with 52% of the vote, the other should be able to do the same thing, Smith argued. \n \n They proposed a new test to determine whether maps were unfairly one-sided. It counts \u201cwasted votes\u201d \u2014 that is, any votes beyond those needed to elect a candidate \u2014 to determine the \u201cefficiency gap\u201d of a map. \n \n Maps have large efficiency gaps when they spread one party\u2019s voters into districts in a way that creates a significant number of wasted votes for them. \n \n Justice Samuel Alito questioned whether courts should adopt a relatively new social science theory rather than waiting for more scholarship. Justice Neil Gorsuch said he was worried new rules would be so vague that states wouldn't know what they were allowed to do. \n \n Roberts called the plaintiffs' test \u201csociological gobbledygook.\u201d \n \n Justice Stephen Breyer said the social science measurements may be gobbledygook, but the idea of fairness is not and there are efficient ways for courts to determine what's fair. \n \n Justice Elena Kagan said courts should be able to determine if maps are fair by using the same tools lawmakers use to draw maps. Computer programs allow lawmakers to put in place maps they can count on to keep them in power. \n \n \u201cWhen legislatures think about drawing these maps, they\u2019re not only thinking about the next election, they're thinking often \u2014 not always \u2014 but often about the election after that and the election after that and the election after that,\" she said. \n \n Read or Share this story: https://jsonl.in/2kj7VMp ||||| Today may have been only the second day of the Supreme Court\u2019s new term, but it may also prove to be one of the biggest. The justices heard oral argument in Gill v. Whitford, a challenge to the redistricting plan passed by Wisconsin\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature in 2011. A federal court struck down the plan last year, agreeing with the plaintiffs that it violated the Constitution because it was the product of partisan gerrymandering \u2013 that is, the practice of purposely drawing district lines to favor one party and put another at a disadvantage. After roughly an hour of oral argument this morning, the justices seemed to agree that partisan gerrymandering is, as Justice Samuel Alito acknowledged, \u201cdistasteful.\u201d But there was no apparent agreement about whether courts could or should get involved in policing the practice. \n \n The case arose after Republicans won majorities in both houses of the Wisconsin legislature and captured the governor\u2019s office, giving them control over the maps that were drawn after the 2010 census. In the 2012 elections, Republicans won slightly less than half of the statewide vote, which translated into 60 seats in the state\u2019s 99-seat assembly; by contrast, Democrats won just over half of the statewide vote but garnered only 39 seats. Two years later, Republicans won 52% of the vote and 63 seats, while Democrats won approximately 48% of the vote and 36 seats. \n \n A group of challengers argued that the new redistricting plan amounted to an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. They contended that the new plan sought to dilute Democratic votes across the state, using two methods: \u201ccracking,\u201d which divides up supporters of one party among different districts so that they do not form a majority in any of them; and \u201cpacking,\u201d which puts large numbers of a party\u2019s supporters in relatively few districts, where they win by large margins. \n \n The dispute went to a divided three-judge district court, which Congress has designated as the forum for redistricting challenges. That court regarded the case as an easy one. Although it may sometimes be difficult to tell when politics plays too influential a role in redistricting, the lower court conceded, this case is \u201cfar more straightforward\u201d: The Republican-controlled legislature drafted a redistricting plan to lock in the party\u2019s control of the state legislature, even though it could have created a different plan that would have accomplished redistricting goals without giving Republicans such a partisan advantage. \n \n The district court may have regarded the case as a \u201cstraightforward\u201d one, but few justices seemed to share that sentiment today. That\u2019s not particularly surprising, because the issue of partisan gerrymandering has deeply divided the Supreme Court in the past. Thirteen years ago, the justices rejected a challenge to Pennsylvania\u2019s redistricting plan, with four justices agreeing that courts should decline to review partisan-gerrymandering claims, because it is too hard to come up with a manageable test to determine when politics plays too influential a role in redistricting. Four other justices would have allowed courts to review partisan-gerrymandering claims. That left Justice Anthony Kennedy, who agreed that the Supreme Court should stay out of the Pennsylvania case but suggested that courts could play a role in reviewing partisan-gerrymandering cases in the future if a workable standard could be found. \n \n Before the justices got to the merits of the case this morning, they tackled another question: whether the plaintiffs have a legal right \u2013 known as \u201cstanding\u201d \u2013 to challenge the 2010 map at all, particularly because some of them live in heavily Democratic districts. Kennedy (whom many regard as the key vote in the case) acknowledged that the plaintiffs could not point to a specific Supreme Court case in their favor, but he asked Wisconsin Solicitor General Misha Tseytlin whether the plaintiffs might have standing if their claims were grounded in the First Amendment, rather than a right to equal protection of the laws. Kennedy seemed to suggest that they would, telling Tseytlin that such plaintiffs would have a First Amendment interest in having their preferred political party be strong, rather than weak. \n \n Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to disagree. He told attorney Paul Smith, who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs challenging the map, that allowing plaintiffs in a partisan-gerrymandering case to challenge an entire map seemed inconsistent with the court\u2019s rule that plaintiffs in racial-gerrymandering cases can only challenge their own districts, not the whole map. \n \n Smith countered that the two scenarios are different: In racial-gerrymandering cases, he argued, the claim does attack a specific district; by contrast, a plaintiff in a partisan-gerrymandering claim is challenging the dilution of one party\u2019s votes statewide. \n \n If five justices were to agree that the plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the whole map, it would allow them to avoid ruling on the merits of the case. But it does not look as though there are five votes for that outcome \u2013 especially if, as Kennedy\u2019s comment suggests, he would allow the lawsuit to go forward. And so most of the one-hour argument today was spent on the substance of the case, and in particular on two closely related questions: Should the courts get involved in reviewing partisan-gerrymandering cases at all; and, if so, what standard should they use to review such claims? \n \n Roberts made clear that, in his view, the Supreme Court should stay out \u2013 for the good of its institutional reputation. He told Smith that if the plaintiffs win, the courts would be flooded with partisan-gerrymandering claims, which would all wind up at the Supreme Court because, unlike in most cases, in which the court can choose which cases to review, the court is generally required to review redistricting challenges. For example, if the Supreme Court rules for the Democrats in a case, Roberts continued, most people will not understand that the decision rests on a complicated calculus. Instead, Roberts posited, the average person will say, \u201cThat\u2019s a bunch of baloney,\u201d and chalk the ruling up to a preference for the Democrats. And that, Roberts stressed, will cause very serious harm to the status and perceived integrity of the Supreme Court. \n \n Smith pushed back, predicting that any potential harm to the Supreme Court\u2019s reputation would pale in comparison with the harm to democracy if the state prevails. Partisan gerrymandering is already bad, he cautioned, but we are on the \u201ccusp of a more serious problem\u201d because officials drawing redistricting maps now have access to vast amounts of data, and because the electorate is now so polarized that voting has become more predictable than ever. If you uphold the Wisconsin map, he told Roberts ominously, the court will be confronted with a \u201cfestival of copycat gerrymandering,\u201d and people will lose faith in democracy altogether. \n \n Roberts was unconvinced, telling Smith that his rule would take democracy away from the legislatures based on social science \u201cgobbledygook.\u201d The court\u2019s newest justice, Neil Gorsuch, was relatively quiet, but he appeared to show his cards when he asked Smith to name the source of the Supreme Court\u2019s authority to revise state redistricting maps. The court should be cautious, Gorsuch emphasized, about stepping in here. \n \n The plaintiffs seemed to find a more receptive audience in Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who told Erin Murphy \u2013 arguing on behalf of the Wisconsin legislature \u2013 that the \u201cprecious right to vote\u201d is at the heart of this case. If legislators can \u201cstack\u201d a legislature, so that the result of the election is \u201cpreordained,\u201d she queried, where is the incentive for voters to actually go to the polls? \u201cSociety should be concerned,\u201d Ginsburg concluded. \n \n Justice Sonia Sotomayor voiced similar concerns. She asked Murphy whether it was okay for one party to \u201cstack the decks, so that for 10 years,\u201d it could garner a minority of the vote but still win a majority of the seats in the legislature. \n \n But although the justices spent some time at the 50,000-feet level, contemplating the broader implications of their ruling, much of their time was spent in the weeds, on what Justice Stephen Breyer described as another \u201chard issue\u201d in the case: If courts are going to get involved with partisan-gerrymandering cases, what are manageable standards that they can apply to evaluate the claims? Breyer offered Tseytlin a five-part test that looked at, among other things, whether one party controls the legislature and the redistricting process; whether the redistricting maps create \u201cpartisan asymmetry\u201d \u2013 that is, they do not treat the different political parties equally; and whether that asymmetry is \u201cpersistent\u201d and extreme. \u201cI suspect,\u201d Breyer told Tseytlin, that the test is manageable. \n \n Justice Elena Kagan seemed to agree. She observed that, if the technology now available to legislators is so good that legislators can draw the maps easily, the same techniques can be used on the back end to evaluate what the legislature was considering when it was drawing the maps. This is not \u201cairy fairy,\u201d she stressed, but instead \u201cpretty scientific.\u201d \n \n Not surprisingly, Tseytlin disagreed. He maintained that the Supreme Court had already rejected some of these kinds of inquiries in its earlier cases. And he repeated a theme that would resurface throughout the hour: Any \u201cstandards\u201d that the court might articulate to evaluate partisan-gerrymandering claims would rely heavily on statistics and battles between each side\u2019s experts. \n \n Murphy picked up this theme, reminding the justices that the kinds of standards that the plaintiffs have proposed have identified \u201cfalse positives\u201d \u2013 districts that appear to be the result of gerrymandering but are not \u2013 50% of the time. What, she asked rhetorically, are legislatures supposed to do when confronted with problems like these? \n \n Justice Samuel Alito was also skeptical. He told Smith that, although everyone has been looking for a manageable standard, one of the theories on which the plaintiffs relied \u2013 known as the \u201cefficiency gap,\u201d which looks at the number of votes \u201cwasted\u201d in each election, either because they are cast for the losing candidate or because the victorious candidate did not need them to win \u2013 was not developed until very recently. \u201cIs this the time for us to jump into this,\u201d Alito asked, when there are still so many questions about the theory? \n \n Although it was obvious that, for Alito, the answer was \u201cno,\u201d for Smith the answer was \u201cyes.\u201d In the 2004 redistricting case, the court provided a blueprint for future partisan-gerrymandering challengers: They would need to give the court manageable standards to evaluate their claims. And that is exactly what social scientists have done, Smith argued. In this case, the district court used three different social-science standards and concluded that the 2010 Wisconsin map was, for purposes of partisan gerrymandering, one of the worst maps ever. \n \n Kagan seemed to be on board with Breyer\u2019s standard, but looked for reassurance that the courts would not be inundated with challenges to other redistricting maps in the future. Smith suggested a variety of measures that seemed to placate Kagan, but not Roberts, who complained that the kind of statistics-based predictions that Smith\u2019s measures would call for had \u201cbeen a very hazardous exercise\u201d for the court in the past. Alito also complained about the \u201cdozens of uncertainties\u201d in the process that Smith was proposing. \n \n Perhaps notably, Kennedy did not ask Smith any questions at all during Smith\u2019s 30 minutes at the lectern \u2013 which, although there\u2019s no way to know, would seem to bode well for the challengers. Smith seemed to direct his closing remarks straight at Kennedy, as he told the justices that if they do not act now, it could be too late. We\u2019ll know by the end of June whether and how the court will act. \n \n This post was originally published at Howe on the Court. \n \n Recommended Citation: Amy Howe, Argument analysis: Cautious optimism for challengers in Wisconsin redistricting case?, SCOTUSblog (Oct. 3, 2017, 2:13 PM), http://www.scotusblog.com/2017/10/argument-analysis-cautious-optimism-challengers-wisconsin-redistricting-case/ ||||| Kennedy\u2019s Vote Is in Play on Voting Maps Warped by Politics Image People including Bill Millhouser protesting gerrymandering outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday. The court was hearing a case based on voting district maps in Wisconsin. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 Justice Anthony M. Kennedy has long been troubled by extreme partisan gerrymandering, where the party in power draws voting districts to give itself a lopsided advantage in elections. But he has never found a satisfactory way to determine when voting maps are so warped by politics that they cross a constitutional line. \n \n After spirited Supreme Court arguments on Tuesday, there was reason to think Justice Kennedy may be ready to join the court\u2019s more liberal members in a groundbreaking decision that could reshape American democracy by letting courts determine when lawmakers have gone too far. \n \n Justice Kennedy asked skeptical questions of lawyers defending a Wisconsin legislative map that gave Republicans many more seats in the State Assembly than their statewide vote tallies would have predicted. He asked no questions of the lawyer representing the Democratic voters challenging the map. \n \n There was something like consensus among the justices that voting maps drawn by politicians to give advantage to their parties are an unattractive feature of American democracy. But the justices appeared split about whether the court could find a standard for determining when the practice was unconstitutional. \n \n \u201cGerrymandering is distasteful,\u201d said Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., \u201cbut if we are going to impose a standard on the courts, it has to be something that\u2019s manageable.\u201d \n \n Some of the court\u2019s more liberal members said the problem represented a crisis for democracy and that the Supreme Court should step in. \n \n \u201cWhat\u2019s really behind all of this?\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg asked. She answered her own question: \u201cThe precious right to vote.\u201d \n \n In extended remarks, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. expressed worry that the court\u2019s authority and legitimacy would be hurt were it to start striking down voting districts in favor of one political party or another. \n \n \u201cThat is going to cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of the country,\u201d he said. \n \n Paul M. Smith, a lawyer for the Democratic voters, urged the court to act. \u201cYou are the only institution in the United States that can solve this problem just as democracy is about to get worse because of the way gerrymandering is getting so much worse,\u201d he told the justices. \n \n Without the Supreme Court\u2019s intervention, Mr. Smith said, other states will follow Wisconsin\u2019s lead. The round of redistricting that will follow the 2020 census, he said, \u201cwill produce a festival of copycat gerrymandering the likes of which this country has never seen.\u201d \n \n The Supreme Court has never struck down an election map on the ground that it was drawn to make sure one political party wins an outsize number of seats. The court has, however, left open the possibility that some kinds of political gamesmanship in redistricting may be too extreme. \n \n The problem, Justice Kennedy wrote in a 2004 concurrence, is that no one has devised \u201ca workable standard\u201d to decide when the political gerrymandering has crossed a constitutional line. \n \n On Tuesday, he pressed Erin E. Murphy, a lawyer for Wisconsin lawmakers, about whether a state law could require drawing districts to have the maximum number of votes for a given political party. Other justices followed up on the point, and Ms. Murphy gave equivocal answers. \n \n Justice Kennedy grew frustrated. \u201cI have to say that I don\u2019t think you ever answered the question,\u201d he said. \n \n Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked Ms. Murphy more fundamental questions. \n \n \u201cCould you tell me what the value is to democracy from political gerrymandering?\u201d Justice Sotomayor asked. \u201cHow does that help our system of government?\u201d \n \n Ms. Murphy said that gerrymandering \u201cproduces values in terms of accountability that are valuable so that the people understand who isn\u2019t and who is in power.\u201d \n \n That did not seem a sufficient reason, Justice Sotomayor said, \u201cto stack the decks.\u201d \n \n Much of the argument concerned various statistical tests for identifying extreme gerrymandering. Misha Tseytlin, Wisconsin\u2019s solicitor general, said the challengers were relying on flimsy and hypothetical social science evidence. \n \n Image Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican and the former governor of California, says districts should be drawn by independent commissions rather than politicians. Credit Tom Brenner/The New York Times \n \n \u201cPlaintiffs are asking this court to launch a redistricting revolution based upon their social science metrics,\u201d he said. \n \n Chief Justice Roberts told Mr. Smith that courts are poorly equipped to evaluate social science data. \u201cIt may be simply my educational background,\u201d the chief justice said of the studies before the court, \u201cbut I can only describe it as sociological gobbledygook.\u201d \n \n Other justices seemed more comfortable with the studies. \n \n \u201cThis is not kind of hypothetical, airy-fairy, we guess, and then we guess again,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan said. \u201cI mean, this is pretty scientific by this point.\u201d \n \n Justice Sotomayor said that \u201cevery single social science metric points in the same direction.\u201d \n \n There may be close cases, Justice Kagan said, but this was not one of them. \u201cThis map goes pretty much over every line,\u201d she said. \n \n Justice Stephen G. Breyer, in remarks that may have been aimed at Justice Kennedy, sketched out a series of criteria that he said amounted to a workable standard. He said courts should act only when there is one-party control of the state government and a map that creates a persistent and unjustified partisan advantage that is \u201can extreme outlier\u201d when compared to other maps. \n \n \u201cI suspect that that\u2019s manageable,\u201d Justice Breyer said. \n \n The case, Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161, started when Republicans gained complete control of Wisconsin\u2019s government in 2010 for the first time at the beginning of a redistricting cycle in more than 40 years. Lawmakers promptly drew a map for the State Assembly that helped Republicans convert very close statewide vote totals into lopsided legislative majorities. \n \n In 2012, after the redistricting, Republicans won 48.6 percent of the statewide vote for Assembly candidates but captured 60 of the Assembly\u2019s 99 seats. \n \n Democratic voters sued, saying the maps violated the Constitution. \u201cThis is one of the most extreme gerrymanders ever drawn in living memory of the United States,\u201d Mr. Smith said on Tuesday. \n \n The case is part of a larger debate over politics in redistricting, one that has taken on new urgency with the advent of sophisticated software. Both parties have engaged in partisan gerrymandering, but these days, Republicans have an advantage following a wave of victories in state legislatures that allowed lawmakers to draw election maps favoring their party. \n \n Some critics, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican and the former governor of California, say districts should be drawn by independent commissions rather than politicians. Prominent Democrats, including former President Barack Obama and his first attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., are pushing to undo the redistricting gains Republicans made after the 2010 census when the next census is taken three years from now. \n \n Outside the court during the arguments, several dozen activists rallied with signs that read \u201cEqual Districts Under Law\u201d and \u201cHands off our Districts!\u201d \n \n Mr. Schwarzenegger, who attended the argument, said afterward that he is hopeful that the justices will put a stop to partisan gerrymandering. \n \n \u201cWe are here today to ask the Supreme Court to fix something that the politicians will never do,\u201d he said. \u201cAs Einstein said, those who created the problem will not be able to solve it.\u201d \n \n Last year, a divided three-judge Federal District Court panel ruled that Republicans in Wisconsin had gone too far. The map, Judge Kenneth F. Ripple wrote for the majority, \u201cwas designed to make it more difficult for Democrats, compared to Republicans, to translate their votes into seats.\u201d \n \n The decision was the first from a federal court in more than 30 years to reject a voting map as partisan gerrymandering. \n \n Wisconsin officials say that the lopsided representation of Republicans in the State Legislature is a product of geography rather than gerrymandering. Democrats have packed themselves into cities, effectively diluting their voting power, while Republicans are more evenly distributed across most states, the brief said. \n \n Judge Ripple acknowledged that the distribution of the population explains at least some part of the gap. \n \n \u201cWisconsin\u2019s political geography, particularly the high concentration of Democratic voters in urban centers like Milwaukee and Madison, affords the Republican Party a natural, but modest, advantage in the districting process,\u201d he wrote. \n \n But he added that partisan gerrymandering amplified that advantage. \n \n Sign Up for the Morning Briefing Get what you need to know to start your day in the United States, Canada and the Americas, delivered to your inbox.

The court heard arguments Tuesday in a redistricting case from Wisconsin, where Democrats say Republicans created districts so lopsided that they violated voters' constitutional rights. Kennedy, a Reagan appointee, seemed skeptical of the arguments made by lawyers defending the Wisconsin voting map and didn't ask any questions at all of the lawyer representing the Democratic voters, which \"would seem to bode well for the challengers,\" SCOTUSBlog notes. Justices including Ruth Bader Ginsburg said it was time for the Supreme Court to step in and stop partisan gerrymandering, though Chief Justice John Roberts said he worried that the court itself would be seen as partisan if it started striking down voting districts, the New York Times reports. That would \"cause very serious harm to the status and integrity of the decisions of this court in the eyes of the country,\" he said. Republicans including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sen. John McCain are siding with Democrats on the issue. \"It is time to say hasta la vista to gerrymandering and it is time to terminate gerrymandering,\" Schwarzenegger said outside the court, per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.",

The case revolves around the use of what's known as an \"efficiency gap\" in political maps, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

A lower court had already declared the map to be partisan gerrymandering, and the justices could now decide whether the lower court's ruling is correct and, if so, what standards the court should set for evaluating such claims.

After all, distance track running often involves these stumbles. \n \n But what happened next became one of the iconic moments of the Rio Olympics, on par with Usain Bolt's triple-triple and Michael Phelps triumphant conclusion to his enormous personal medal tally. \n \n D'Agostino, quicker to her feet than Hamblin, helped get her off the turf, before she shuffled her way through 4 1/2 laps to finish the race, where Hamblin was waiting for her.

At their core, the Games are about the Olympic values of excellence, friendship and respect. They are about fair play and human spirit. \n \n Nobody has epitomised these values more at the Olympic Games Rio 2016 than runners Abbey D\u2019Agostino (USA) and Nikki Hamblin (NZL) and, beyond the Games, the Norwegian men\u2019s handball team. The International Fair Play Committee (CIFP), with the support of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), presented them with Fair Play awards today at the Olympic Club in the Olympic Park in Rio de Janeiro for two separate acts of selflessness and exemplary sportsmanship. \n \n The D\u2019Agostino and Hamblin story is one of humanity and sacrifice which has already captured the hearts of people across the globe. New Zealand runner Nikki Hamblin tripped and fell to the ground during the 5,000m race, accidentally bringing American D\u2019Agostino down behind her with around 2,000m to go. The 24-year-old D\u2019Agostino was quick to get up again, yet instead of carrying on with her race she stopped to help the stricken Hamblin to her feet, encouraging her to join her in attempting to finish the race. However, during her tumble, D\u2019Agostino suffered an ankle injury, slowing the runner down, but Hamblin sportingly hung back to in return offer her encouragements. The two women went on to complete the race together. \n \n Getty Images \n \n Speaking of this recognition after the ceremony, 28-year-old Nikki Hamblin said: \u201cI think it\u2019s very special for both Abbey and myself. I don\u2019t think either of us woke up and thought that that was going to be our day, or our race, or our Olympic Games. Both of us are strong competitors and we wanted to go out there and do our best on the track.\u201d \n \n She added: \u201cI was on the ground for too long to get back up and catch on to the pack. So then it becomes about finishing the race, and finishing the race well. I am so grateful to Abbey for picking me up, and I think many people would have returned the favour. [\u2026] Once you are on the track, there is a mutual understanding of what it takes to get there.\u201d \n \n Getty Images \n \n The Norwegian men\u2019s handball team was also honoured for its gracious attitude during a European championship match against Germany earlier this year, which saw them lose out on their Olympic dream. The match was tied when at the last minute the German team scored a goal. It was discovered that when the goal had been scored an extra player had come onto the field. Although the Norwegian team had every right to file a protest, after much deliberation, they finally opted not to contest the results as they felt that the additional player on the field, though illegal, did not partake in the activities that helped the German team score the final goal. Germany went on to qualify for the Olympics, while the Norwegians did not. \n \n \u201cThis is an honour for the Norwegian Handball Federation and for the players,\u201d commented the President of the Norwegian Handball Federation Kaare Geir Lio. \u201cIt is also recognition for international handball, of how we want to play, and of how we want to be. We have fair play as a value and keyword in Norwegian handball in addition to respect, amongst others. And those two together are very important for us. This award is very energising and inspiring for us.\u201d \n \n The trophies were presented by IOC Vice-President and Executive Board Member Nawal El Moutawakel and master of ceremonies CIFP Secretary General Sunil Sabharwal. \n \n Nawal El Moutawakel said: \u201cThe Olympic Games Rio 2016 have reminded all of us of the power and magic of sport. In the past weeks, the athletes have amazed us with their outstanding achievements and performances. We have seen new world records, we have seen high-level performances, we have seen personal bests and we have also seen great emotions. We have also been inspired by great moments of sportsmanship.

    "document": "Amanda Knox traveled to Italy to study writing. A few weeks later, the American college student became a murder suspect. Now nearly a year after she was convicted in a second trial by an Italian court, Knox has returned to writing, as a journalist in Seattle. \n \n Knox has been working as a freelance reporter for the small West Seattle Herald for a few months, according to Web Editor Patrick Robinson. The Herald asked her to be a freelance reporter, but not because of her notorious status. \n \n \u201cWe approached her originally to give her the opportunity of a normal life,\u201d Robinson told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe simply asked her as we would ask anyone of that age and stage, if they would be interested in writing for us as a qualified writer of that scale and this level of journalism.\u201d \n \n In November 2007, Knox\u2019s roommate, Meredith Kercher, was found dead in the house they shared with two other women. Authorities arrested Knox, boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito, and a bar owner and charged them in Kercher\u2019s murder. In 2009, Knox and Sollecito were found guilty of murder. Both spent four years in prison before a court acquitted them in 2011 after evidence was thrown into doubt by independent experts. Knox returned to the U.S. following acquittal, but a court in January 2014 upheld the 2009 guilty verdict and sentenced Knox and Sollecito to more than 25 years. Knox has not been extradited to Italy while the case is appealed. \n \n In 2012, Knox signed a book deal reportedly worth $4 million. A movie based on a book by The Daily Beast\u2019s Barbie Latza Nadeau has been made into a movie starring Kate Beckinsale. \n \n Knox wanted to write under a pen name at first, which the paper allowed her to do. \n \n \u201cThat was purposely to give her the protection of that and to give her the opportunity. She showed us writing samples and they were good,\u201d Robinson said.

Is it a hill? A castle? A balcony? A ship? It will serve as all of the above and be just what it is\u2014none of those things. \n \n Tom Stoppard\u2019s Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is notorious for turning Hamlet on its head and questioning everything one takes for granted: time, space, identity, reality, fate, freedom. It\u2019s a major theme that Finley is emphasizing in multiple ways. The set is clearly a construct, begging the audience to exercise their imagination and at the same time recognize the artifice. The characters from Hamlet\u2014the King, Queen, Laertes, Ophelia, the players\u2014will each be played by multiple members of an ensemble cast, so that the audience won\u2019t be able to pin down characters by their most defining human aspect: their faces. As the script suggests, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern will be confused one with the other, but Finley emphasizes that confusion by casting a boy and a girl for these principle roles. \u201cIt\u2019s this male character who\u2019s played by a female actor. We never try to make her look like a boy, but we don\u2019t make it obvious that she\u2019s a girl either. There are a couple of moments in the play when the head player of the drama troupe that they encounter makes a couple of references to, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m always in costume\u2026SIR,\u2019 as if to say, \u2018I can see through your costume. You\u2019re clearly a girl, but we\u2019re going to pretend you\u2019re a guy.\u2019 It\u2019s part of this question of what is your identity and how can you tell? What do you know and what do you not know?\u201d \n \n \n \n Usually this kind of questioning seems to be a departure from practical, every-day existence. Any single person has a set name, job, friends and family. But Finley argues that high school is a particularly appropriate setting for exploring the questioning of reality and identity. \u201cThe other major theme is hopelessness, and I\u2019d rather not hit that one so hard for the people who will largely populate my audience. I\u2019d rather explore identity and how do you know who you are and how do you build an identity, because my target audience is in the process of doing that.\u201d \n \n There are a few things you should remember before seeing the show. \u201cR&G,\u201d as Finley affectionately calls it, is a re-envisioning of the tragedy Hamlet from the perspective of two minor characters. Finley recommends that you have a general understanding of the story and themes of the Shakespearean tragedy so you can get the most out of the references made to it. He\u2019s even considering holding a viewing of the Mel Gibson film version of Hamlet for those underclassmen who haven\u2019t read the play in school yet. \n \n The other thing Finley wants you to remember is that R&G, unlike Hamlet, is a comedy. \u201cIf it\u2019s not funny, you\u2019re doing it wrong. If people walk in thinking this is Hamlet, it\u2019s going to take them much of the first act to realize that, \u2018Oh, wait, not only was what they said funny, but it\u2019s appropriate for me to laugh.\u2019\u201d \n \n Finley has high hopes for the production and every confidence in his cast and crew. \u201cRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead has always been one of my really favorite plays. I\u2019ve always wanted to do this show and I\u2019ve been waiting for the right group of kids. This year we\u2019ve got it.\u201d \n \n Performances are scheduled for November 6, 7, 8 and 12, 13, 14 at 7:30 p.m. at West Seattle High School\u2019s campus, 3000 California Ave SW.

    "document": "\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get back to our businesses, which I love, and the first order of business, the first priority, is getting down to Florida tomorrow, getting to that spring training camp and bringing the Mets back to the prominence our fans deserve,\u201d a clearly relieved Mr. Wilpon said outside federal court in Manhattan . \n \n Mr. Picard was appointed by a bankruptcy judge in 2008 to recover money for Mr. Madoff\u2019s victims. To date, he has secured some $9 billion \u2014 or about half his goal \u2014 much of it from Madoff investors he has asserted were unjust beneficiaries of \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d returns. \n \n In his lawsuit against Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz, Mr. Picard asserted that the men were sophisticated investors who were among those illegitimate beneficiaries. But Mr. Picard suffered a number of setbacks. The lawsuit was removed from bankruptcy court, and Jed S. Rakoff of the United States District Court, who took over the case, both reduced Mr. Picard\u2019s financial claims and raised the legal bar he would have to clear in order to collect. \n \n Still, if Mr. Picard had prevailed at trial, he could have recouped as much as $303 million, in addition to the $83 million the Mets\u2019 owners were already ordered to pay. \n \n His decision to settle for much less was regarded by a number of experts as a kind of surrender on the explosive assertions that were central to the case. Legal experts said the settlement would most likely embolden other defendants who are fighting accusations brought by the trustee. Mr. Picard has filed several large suits that have accused defendants of misconduct, including actions against some of Mr. Madoff\u2019s relatives and one of his primary banks , JPMorgan Chase . The cases make similar bad-faith claims to the one brought against the Mets\u2019 owners. \n \n \u201cI certainly consider this a capitulation by the trustee,\u201d said Bradley D. Simon, a former federal prosecutor who focuses on white-collar civil litigation for Simon & Partners. \u201cIt seems quite one-sided.\u201d \n \n The Mets, as a baseball operation, still face significant financial trouble. The club has lost some $120 million over the past two years, has had to slash its payroll as attendance has fallen at Citi Field , and has had to put a portion of the team up for sale. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n But the resolution of the suit, and on such favorable terms, ends an enormous financial threat. \n \n \u201cThat decision removed the defendants from the sword of Damocles hanging over their lives,\u201d Mario M. Cuomo , the former New York governor who was appointed as the mediator in the case in early 2011, said outside the courtroom. \u201cAnd it will enable them to return to their work, their family and normalcy.\u201d \n \n Photo \n \n Mr. Cuomo, who has been mediating high-profile disputes for decades, had not appeared to make much progress as the lawsuit, complete with acrimonious filings, ground on. \n \n But with the case headed for trial, Mr. Cuomo evidently finally made headway. \n \n About two weeks ago, he reached out to both sides, inviting Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz to his offices at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. He suggested to Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz that a trial could be both embarrassing and damaging to their reputations, and in a separate conversations he lobbied the trustee to come to a settlement. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

It\u2019s called common sense.\u201d \n \n The settlement itself underscores how complicated the Madoff bankruptcy has proved to be. \n \n Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz, as well as their business partners and family members, had hundreds of accounts with Mr. Madoff\u2019s firm when he was arrested in December 2008. \n \n The trustee had identified many of those account as \u201cnet winners\u201d \u2014 asserting that the owners of those accounts had over the years withdrawn more money from them than they had put in. He argued that, in fact, those profits were \u201cother people\u2019s money,\u201d and had to be returned. \n \n Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz contended that they also had scores of accounts that were \u201cnet losers,\u201d and they had applied to the very same trustee who was suing them to be reimbursed for those losses. \n \n The settlement announced Monday amounts to a swap: Mr. Picard dropped the claims that the men had ignored warnings about Mr. Madoff; Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz agreed that they were obligated to pay back $162 million in so-called fictitious profits they had reaped from the net winner accounts from 2002 to \u201908. That figure includes the $83 million that Judge Rakoff had earlier ordered them to pay. \n \n How much of that $162 million the men will ultimately have to pay depends, oddly, on how successful Mr. Picard is in his efforts to recover money for Madoff victims. The Mets\u2019 owners had applied to Mr. Picard to be reimbursed $178 million from their net loser accounts. If Mr. Picard\u2019s recoveries do not yield $162 million after three years, Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz have guaranteed to pay as much as $29 million. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n What was clear was that Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz used the settlement as vindication of their character. \u201cWe acted in good faith and we\u2019re very pleased that this settlement bears that out,\u201d Mr. Wilpon said. \n \n For the trustee, the settlement appeared to be a business calculation: even if he could win a judgment that Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz were willfully blind to Mr. Madoff\u2019s fraud \u2014 and have the verdict upheld on appeals that might take two or three years \u2014 he might not have received the $303 million he was seeking. \n \n \u201cIt isn\u2019t whether we win or lose,\u201d David J. Sheehan, chief counsel to the trustee, said. \u201cIt\u2019s whether we enhance the fund and help the victims. That\u2019s what we did today, and that\u2019s why we did it.\u201d \n \n Mr. Sheehan\u2019s remarks Monday conflicted with much tougher ones made 13 months ago, when he said, \u201cWhat we\u2019re looking for is a billion dollars, and unless we settle for less than that, which we\u2019re not inclined to do, where they get the money is of no moment to us.\u201d \n \n Mr. Picard might also have had second thoughts about the strength of his case. Judge Rakoff had been skeptical that Mr. Picard could successfully rebut Mr. Wilpon and Mr. Katz\u2019s claims that they acted in good faith in their investing with Mr. Madoff. \n \n Still, however strong Sheehan and Picard felt their case was, they could not be certain of victory. \n \n \u201cAny lawyer who walks into court knows that you can win, you can lose, and you can have the strongest case possible but you don\u2019t know how the evidence will come in or how the jury will perceive the credibility of the witnesses,\u201d said Annemarie McAvoy, a former federal prosecutor who is an adjunct professor at Fordham Law School. She said Mr. Picard \u201cdid away with the risk of walking away with nothing at the end of the trial.\u201d \n \n As he read aloud the terms of the settlement between two parties who had battled each other bitterly for more than a year, Judge Rakoff said, \u201cAll I say is love is wonderful.\u201d ||||| WHAT HAPPENED: The owners of the New York Mets have settled with trustee Irving Picard for $162 million, their alleged profit from certain Ponzi scheme funds in the six years before Bernard Madoff's arrest. \n \n In reality, Fred Wilpon and family will be on the hook for only a fraction of that amount -- and will not be required to make any payments until 2016 and 2017. \n \n That's because, as part of the settlement, the Wilpons will be able to apply to the trustee to be reimbursed for $178 million in losses from certain funds. Obviously, like any victims of Madoff's Ponzi scheme, they won't recover every dollar. But they will get a certain percentage based on how much the trustee collects overall from net winners -- likely 50 percent or more. \n \n As a result, the Wilpons' actual payment to Picard -- once the Wilpons' loser funds are reimbursed like other victims -- should be a fraction of the actual $162 million settlement. \n \n Say if Picard pays to victims 50 cents on the dollars they lost. That means the Wilpons could be credited $89 million (half of $178 million) toward their $162 million owed as a result of the settlement. That's a net of only $73 million remaining to pay Picard to satisfy the settlement. \n \n Any disbursements owed by Picard to Wilpon loser funds over the next three years will be deducted from the $162 million owed by the Wilpons to Picard in the settlement. The Wilpons then will owe the remaining amount in equal installments in four and five years. \n \n The lawsuit sought to recover $386 million. Judge Jed S. Rakoff previously had decided that Picard likely was entitled to at least $83.3 million in profits from the two years before Madoff's arrest. \n \n The original suit was for $1 billion, but it was reduced by Rakoff, who decided that Picard could only recover money from the Wilpons from the immediate two years before Madoff's arrest, not the six years Picard advocated. The settlement, while not overturning Rakoff's decision, does establish for the trustee six years as an acceptable period to recover profits. \n \n The settlement talks were brokered by former New York governor Mario Cuomo. \n \n WHAT IT MEANS: It's unlikely the Wilpons would have settled unless they felt they could withstand that financial obligation without jeopardizing their ownership of the team. \n \n Still, the Wilpons are not out of the woods yet as owners. \n \n Remember, the Mets still have a ton of debt unrelated to the lawsuit. Among the more immediate obligations are a $40 million bridge loan from Bank of America and $25 million emergency loan from Major League Baseball. UPDATE: The Mets have paid those immediate loan obligations thanks for a $240 million equity infusion from minority investors, many of which had existing ties to the ballclub. \n \n You can read about the extent of the debt in Part 1 and Part 2 of the financial series from ESPNNewYork.com from late January. \n \n WHAT'S NEXT: Back to baseball, hopefully. \n \n Actually, it's going to still be the Mets on austerity for a while, because of the financial obligations mentioned above. That means the Wilpons will be utterly dependent upon fan attendance revenue in order to maintain ownership. \n \n The Mets eventually hope to sell 10 to 12 minority shares of the team at $20 million apiece, although a good deal of that appears to be shifting around money among Mets-related entities. For instance, two of those shares are going to Jeff Wilpon and Saul Katz, who is Fred Wilpon's brother-in-law and Mets president. Another four will go to SportsNet New York, the regional sports channel primarily owned by the Wilpons/Mets. \n \n There is only one known minority buyer without direct connection to the Wilpons or Mets. And that's Steve Cohen, who reportedly is the front-runner for majority ownership of the Los Angeles Dodgers, which would eliminate him as a Mets candidate. \n \n Read the ESPNNewYork.com news story here.",

Trustee Irving Picard had sued Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz for $1 billion (later knocked down to $386 million), saying they disregarded warnings about Madoff's dealings; they claimed ignorance. Much of the $162 million will be balanced by money Katz and Wilpon will receive as \"net losers\" from the scheme themselves.

    "document": "October 13, 2011 at 2:58 pm by \n \n Google engineer Steve Yegge may think some things are messed up at Google. But the search giant continues to deliver, with the company announcing today that net income for the third quarter blew by analysts estimates to $2.73 billion on net revenue of $7.51 billion. The stock is surging in after hours trading as a result, jumping more than six percent to $595. \n \n CEO Larry Page said in a release that it was a \u201cgreat quarter,\u201d and stock analyst Colin Gillis told CNBC that \u201cChristmas came early for Google shareholders.\u201d \n \n Page also touted the growth of Google +, the new social networking service that was the partial subject of Yegge\u2019s widely-read rant. There are now more than 40 million people on Google+, with Page saying the numbers are growing rapidly. \n \n The report comes amid big changes at Google, including its plan to gobble up Motorola Mobility. \n \n But, despite the changes and big moves in mobile, Google is still very much a search advertising-based business. The company reported a 33 percent year-over-year revenue increase to $9.72 billion, largely on back of its advertising revenues. \n \n At the end of September, Google \u2014 which employs about 1,000 people in the Seattle area \u2014 employed 31,353 wordlwide. That was up from 28,768 at the end of June. No wonder the company is expanding its real estate in the Seattle area. \n \n Full earnings release can be found here. \n \n And here\u2019s a look at the slide deck that Google shared with investors today. \n \n google_earnings_slides \n \n \n \n ||||| Image caption Google boss Larry Page said the company had \"a great quarter\" \n \n Internet giant Google has reported a large rise in profits in the three months to September. \n \n The search engine said net income in the third quarter surged 26% to $2.73bn (\u00a31.74bn), up from $2.17bn in the same period last year. \n \n Earlier this year, Google launched Google+, a social network to take on Facebook. \n \n \"People are flocking into Google+ at an incredible rate,\" said Google head Larry Page. \n \n The profits were well ahead of market expectations, and shares in the company rose 6% in trading after the market closed. \n \n \"The real interesting thing here is the expenses weren't as high as the Street was anticipating,\" said UBS analyst Brian Pitz. \"This is the fourth quarter in a row the company has accelerated their revenue on top line.\" \n \n Revenue rose 33% to $9.72bn - just shy of having a quarterly turnover of $10bn. \n \n Mr Page, a co-founder of the company, replaced Eric Schmidt as CEO in April. \n \n \"We had a great quarter,\" he said. \"Google+ is now open to everyone and we just passed the 40 million-user mark.\" \n \n Facebook, around since 2004, has around 800 million users. \n \n As well as generating money through advertising based on search, Google also makes the popular Android mobile phone operating system. ||||| Bloomberg News \n \n Oct. 13 (Bloomberg) -- The U.S. Internal Revenue Service is auditing how Google Inc. avoided federal income taxes by shifting profit into offshore subsidiaries, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. \n \n The agency is bringing more than typical scrutiny to how the company valued software rights and other intellectual property it licensed abroad, said the person, who requested anonymity because the audit isn\u2019t public. The IRS has requested information from Google about its offshore deals after three acquisitions, including its $1.65 billion purchase of YouTube, the person said. The transfer overseas of these kinds of rights rights has enabled Google to attribute earnings to foreign units that pay lower taxes, Bloomberg News reported a year ago. \n \n While Google\u2019s potential liability isn\u2019t clear, similar deals between companies and offshore arms are often the subject of disputes over hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes, said Daniel Frisch, an economist at Horst Frisch Inc. which advises businesses on transfer pricing -- the allocation of income between units in different countries. In 2006, the IRS settled a case with drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc for $3.4 billion. \n \n \u201cThe very biggest transfer-pricing tax disputes are over transfers of intangibles to offshore subsidiaries,\u201d said Frisch, whose firm is based in Washington. \n \n Google, owner of the world\u2019s most popular search engine, has cut its worldwide tax bill by about $1 billion a year using a pair of strategies called the \u201cDouble Irish\u201d and \u201cDutch Sandwich,\u201d which move profits through units in Ireland, the Netherlands and Bermuda. Google reported an effective tax rate of 18.8 percent in the second quarter, less than half the average combined U.S. and state statutory rate of 39.2 percent. \n \n Tax Holiday \n \n \u201cThis is a routine inquiry,\u201d said Jim Prosser, a spokesman for Mountain View, California-based Google. He declined to comment further. \n \n Dean Patterson, a spokesman for the IRS in Washington, said federal law prohibits the agency from discussing specific taxpayers. \n \n U.S. companies are sitting on at least $1.375 trillion in earnings in their foreign subsidiaries on which they have paid no federal income taxes, according to a May report by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Companies including Google, Cisco Systems Inc., Pfizer Inc., Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are lobbying Congress for a tax holiday on bringing home those profits, which would otherwise be subject to U.S. income tax at the 35 percent corporate rate with a credit for foreign taxes already paid. \n \n The Obama administration is opposed to that tax break and has been stepping up criticism of tax preferences for various industries and millionaires. Last week, Senate Democrats proposed a new surtax on people earning at least $1 million a year, a move that would generate an estimated $453 billion over the coming decade. \n \n France Probe \n \n The French tax authority also began reviewing Google\u2019s income shifting in December, examining transactions between the company\u2019s French and Irish subsidiaries, according to two people with knowledge of the probe. The French inquiry was prompted by the October 2010 Bloomberg article on the company\u2019s tax-cutting strategy, the people said. \n \n A spokesman for the French budget ministry, which oversees the tax authority, declined to comment, saying the agency cannot discuss individual cases. \n \n Multinational companies cut their tax bills by shifting earnings into subsidiaries in offshore tax havens, a strategy that is drawing increased scrutiny from the IRS. \n \n In May, the IRS appointed its first transfer-pricing director, Samuel Maruca. Last year, it announced the assignment of additional agents and attorneys to examine a few large companies as part of a pilot program. The IRS wouldn\u2019t discuss whether Google is one of those companies. \n \n Valuable Patents \n \n Moving profit abroad is particularly important for cutting the tax bills of technology and pharmaceutical companies because of their valuable and easily transportable collection of patents and copyrights. Google, Cisco, Facebook Inc., Microsoft and Forest Laboratories Inc., maker of the blockbuster antidepressant Lexapro, have used tax-cutting strategies that move profits into units -- often with no employees or offices -- in havens such as Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, Bloomberg has reported. \n \n In recent years, the IRS has engaged in a number of high profile disagreements with multinational companies over their transfer pricing. In 2006, the agency announced it was settling its dispute with GlaxoSmithKline. \n \n In 2009, the IRS lost a closely watched U.S. Tax Court case with Veritas, now a part of computer-security software maker Symantec Corp. In that dispute, over intellectual property rights moved to an offshore subsidiary, the IRS sought $545 million. \n \n Enforcement Setback \n \n The win for Veritas was a major setback for the IRS\u2019s ability to enforce transfer-pricing rules, according to H. David Rosenbloom, an attorney at Caplin & Drysdale in Washington, and director of the International Tax program at New York University School of Law. \n \n Income shifting by multinational companies cost the U.S. $90 billion in federal tax revenue during 2008, according to a March article in the trade journal Tax Notes by Kimberly Clausing, an economics professor at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. \n \n Google cuts its tax bill by about $1 billion a year using a technique that allocates profits to a unit managed out of a law firm in Bermuda, where there is no corporate income tax. In 2009, the most recent year for which records are available, this subsidiary collected 4.34 billion euros (about $6.1 billion) in royalties from a Google unit in the Netherlands, according to a Dutch corporate filing. \n \n As of June 30, Google held $18.8 billion in cash in its foreign subsidiaries, almost half its total $39.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. \n \n \u2018Buy In\u2019 \n \n The IRS has already approved a major part of Google\u2019s strategy. In 2006, the agency signed off on a 2003 intracompany transaction that moved foreign rights to its search technology to an Irish subsidiary managed in Bermuda called Google Ireland Holdings. That deal -- known as a \u201cbuy in\u201d in tax parlance -- meant subsequent profit overseas based on those copyrights has been attributed to foreign subsidiaries rather than to Google in the U.S. where the technology was developed. \n \n The IRS approval came in an accord known as an advance pricing agreement. Those arrangements are part of an agency program intended to forestall disputes with companies, including disagreements over the price paid by offshore units for patent and other intellectual property rights. \n \n Google Acquisitions \n \n That deal between the IRS and Google only covered rights the company held as of the 2003 licensing deal with its Irish unit. It didn\u2019t cover copyrights subsequently acquired by the U.S. parent and then moved abroad. \n \n Following that 2003 transaction, Google made several acquisitions, spending $1.65 billion for online-video site YouTube in 2006; $625 million for e-mail security service Postini in 2007; and $3.2 billion for web-advertising company DoubleClick Inc. in 2008. The IRS now is examining the prices paid by the foreign subsidiaries for the rights to software and other intangibles moved offshore that formerly belonged to those three companies. \n \n According to U.S. Treasury Department rules, foreign units licensing rights from their U.S. parents are supposed to pay an \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d price, or the amount that would be paid by an unrelated company. If the offshore subsidiary pays too little, that has the effect of shifting income overseas, thus helping the parent avoid U.S. income taxes. \n \n SEC Review \n \n Google\u2019s taxes have also drawn government scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Last December, the SEC asked the company for \u201cgreater detail\u201d about the profit it said it had earned in countries with lower tax rates and the impact on its effective tax rate, according to correspondence released by the agency in March. The SEC said in a February letter that it had completed its review of Google\u2019s filings. It is unclear what action, if any, the agency took. \n \n In August, Google announced it was spending $12.5 billion to acquire Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc., the Libertyville, Illinois telecom-equipment and mobile-phone maker. Google said it was doing the deal primarily for Motorola\u2019s collection of valuable patents. Prosser didn\u2019t respond to a question about whether Google would be moving any of those patent rights offshore. \n \n --With assistance from Mark Deen in Paris.

That forced NASA to reroute coolant into Loop-B. As a result, the station's six-person crew had to prioritize life support systems, electrical systems and science experiments \u2014 including the freezers that preserve scientific samples. Some non-critical systems were turned off in NASA's Harmony node, Japan's Kibo lab and Europe's Columbus lab. \n \n \n \n The crew \"worked to keep the freezers going, \" Byerly said. \n \n Engineers think the problem was caused by a malfunctioning flow control valve for the station's ammonia coolant. Mission managers are trying to determine whether a software fix can get the valve working again, or whether a spacewalk will be required. Sorting through all the issues might take a couple of days, or as much as a couple of weeks. \n \n Routine maintenance \n \n It generally takes two weeks to plan for a \"Big 14\" repair operation, but that depends on the resources at hand and the urgency of the problem. In May, NASA astronauts mounted a spacewalk to replace a leaky coolant pump control box after just two days of planning. Spacewalkers also dealt with coolant system maintenance issues in 2012, 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2007. \n \n \n \n U.S. spacewalks were temporarily suspended after Italian astronaut Luca Parmitano's spacesuit filled with water during a July outing, but Russian spacewalks have proceeded without problems. And since July, NASA has made significant progress on resolving the spacesuit problem that Parmitano faced. \n \n \"We are cleared for a contingency spacewalk if we need to do one,\" NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries told NBC News. \n \n Two Americans, three Russians and a Japanese astronaut are living on the space station, which has been continuously occupied since 2000 by spacefliers who spend tours of duty generally lasting four to six months. The current plan calls for the space station to be maintained through 2020, although the United States and the 14 other countries supporting the $100 billion-plus station project are already considering extending its operating life. \n \n More about the space station: \n \n Alan Boyle is NBCNews.com's science editor.

    "concatenated_intermediate": "\u2013 A serious problem with the International Space Station's cooling systems has prompted a rare cutback in normal operations, but \"the crew was never in any danger,\" a NASA spokesman tells NBC News. \"They're fine for the near future.\" The trouble began when one of the station's two external cooling loops, known as Loop-A, shut down yesterday, forcing NASA to reroute coolant into Loop-B. The six-person crew had to prioritize systems like life support, electrical systems, and science experiments, and turn off some non-critical systems. \"This is the kind of thing that they expected to happen, at about the expected rate,\" says an NBC space analyst. Mission managers are trying to figure out whether a software fix can get the valve working again, or whether a spacewalk will be required. \u2013 NASA is still trying to figure out the cause of a faulty pump that shut down one of the International Space Station's two cooling loops yesterday, but officials say the station is in no danger, NBC News reports. An emergency spacewalk could be the best way to fix the problem, but it could be a few days before that decision is made. NASA says the station was never in any danger because of the shut-down of the pump, which is part of the station's cooling system, the AP reports. \u2013 A faulty cooling loop has shut down some systems on the International Space Station, but the station's life support system is still running and the six-person crew is not in danger, NASA says. The problem is with an external cooling loop that circulates ammonia outside the station to keep equipment cool, the BBC reports. Officials discovered the malfunctioning loop was producing too much ammonia today morning, and teams have shut it down, shutting down some noncritical systems.",
